"We must be mad , he thought . We 're tiny and it 's a big world and we never stop to learn enough about where we are before we go somewhere else . At least back when I lived in a hole I knew everything there was to know about living in a hole , and now it 's a year later and I 'm at a place so far away I do n't even know how far away it is , watching something I do n't understand go to a place so far up there is no down .

"But , the fact is you can read over it , you can study it in a very literary way , you just ca n't do the same thing with Johnson . It 's very much , you know erm stage , a stage .

"Today the word ‘ box’ can mean anything from a development bank — Al Sandook Al Naqd ( ‘ the box of money’ , translated literally)— to a reference to a Sheikh 's largesse . ‘ He never once put his hand into his box all the years that I served him,’ meaning he never gave me a gift of money , a bonus for service above and beyond the call of time . In this instance , I knew the young man 's father would have to dig deep into his box before the marriage was finally consummated and the bride brought home . But his ‘ box’ was large . It would not constitute an insurmountable problem .",0
"She was the first Siamese twin of her kind after an operation in March 1985 performed at Great Ormond Street Hospital by Prof Spitz . At just a few days old , she and Carly , who were born in Rush Green Hospital , Romford , Essex , joined at the chest and upper abdomen , sharing a liver heart cavity , were separated in seven hours of surgery . Holly had a normal heart and made good progress but Carly , who had a heart defect , died on April 10 1985 , after a three - hour operation to clear a bile duct . Mr Ronnie Reich and his wife Gillian took Holly home five months later . At the time , Mrs Reich , then 30 , said : ‘ I never thought this day would come .",1

"With the recent mainstream success of a number of blues albums — John Lee Hooker 's , for instance , and Gary Moore 's — has there been any let - up in the record company pressure on Robert Cray to widen his commercial appeal ? ' Well , I know that a lot of musicians have that kind of pressure put on them , but I 've never really gotten any bullshit from anybody about what to do . We were playing for a long time before we ever had a deal , and when we eventually got signed by a big company , they pretty much took us for what we were . Of course , record companies are always going to want you to have a hit , but as far as what we do , they just have to look at our albums and try to pick out something they can exploit that way , after the event , as compared to trying to make us sit down and write a hit . I think that if we ever tried that , it would ruin our band .",1

"Talent : Sky 's Race Starts Here Lust in Space Critics have drooled and dribbled over her out - of - this - world beauty and wide , spacey blue eyes , but now Kim Basinger is confounding them all by playing the title creature - from - another - planet in My Stepmother Is An Alien . It 's a weird galaxy - swap comedy , which requires the extra - terrestrial Basinger ( like Daryl Hannah 's mermaid in Splash ) to capture the laughs with her innocence about adult human relationships .

"Extending the idea of ' reading ' beyond print This book is mainly concerned with obtaining meaning from the printed and pictorial material in books , but it would be a mistake to disregard the other common media of indirect experience . Young people 's needs for information , understanding , and entertainment are not only met by books but also by television programmes , by cinema films , and by recorded sound . If we are concerned with obtaining meaning from symbols and images , it follows that we should be concerned with this wide range of media . Indeed , there is a whole range of ' reading ' that is more basic than that already considered and that is crucially important in human lives .",1
Are you constantly having to move things around in your cabinet in order to find what you need ? Are all your cupboards or closets crammed full ? Can you see items on your shelves or in your cabinets which you have not used for at least a year ? Has the size of your household changed since the last time you bought a kitchen appliance ? Do people tend to stand around in your kitchen when they are eating a snack or drinking the odd cup of coffee because there is no place to sit ?,1

"It was shortly after his time at Oxford , on his first journey to the Continent , that Hobbes found that others were dissatisfied with scholasticism ; and we have already noted that an interest in method was characteristic of the seventeenth century . So these ideas in Hobbes are an expression of a prevailing wave of thought , a wave which moves on through Gassendi and Locke . Despite the aridities of scholastic philosophy , Hobbes did think that , over the centuries , the seeds of natural reason had borne some fruit . Three notable instances were the geometry of Euclid , the work done on the motion of falling bodies by Galileo , and the discovery of the circulation of the blood by William Harvey . Hobbes 's discovery of geometry and his growing sense of the importance of motion in understanding the world were milestones in his intellectual development .",0

"Was that the problem ? And more importantly than that , what was a Pakistani doing in a position of power and influence in a publishing house ? The man ( if it was a man ) was probably a fairly junior member of the firm ; if only Henry could find a way of getting past him to the people really in the driving seat . He must n't think about his book . Thinking about his book was almost worse than thinking about Elinor .",0
"They only possessions they had were the travel - weary clothes they stood up in .

"I 'll get you so you wo n't even recognise your own body but after we 've done it you 'll be grateful to me that I made you do it and you 'll enjoy it and you 'll get better at it and one day you 'll thank me for doing this to you . In some of the envelopes in Boy 's shoebox were photographs . Some of these were old portraits that Boy had bought in a street market early on a Sunday morning , wing collars and moustaches printed in sepia ; some were cut from pornographic magazines or bodybuilding magazines ( in colour ) ; some were cut from newspapers ( these in black and white ) . On the back or across the front of these photographs were signatures duplicated from the letters ; John Addington Symonds , Baron Corvo , Robbie Ross , for Boy with kindest regards from Reggie Turner . There had been no attempt to make these signatures credible ; the words ‘ for my Dear and especial Boy , with affectionate regards from Mr Arthur Bloxam’ appeared across a faded nineteenth - century portrait ; but they also appeared scrawled lavishly across a portrait of an eighteen - year - old boxer torn from the sports pages of a recent newspaper .",1

"She went home to lie down . ' See it in its historical perspective , ' Ellen comforted her husband when she returned in the small hours . ' ' Men make their own history , ' to quote the master , ' but they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves , but under circumstances directly encountered , given and transmitted from the past . The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the minds of the living . And just when they seem engaged in revolutionizing themselves and things , in creating something that has never yet existed , precisely in such periods of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service and borrow from them names and little cries in order to present the new scene of world history in this time - honoured disguise and this borrowed language .

"She 's still full of the joys of spring . If she can retain the mood , she 's laughing,’ said Howells .

"Strathclyde 's chairman of highways and transport , Malcolm Waugh , has said he will give no blank cheque to ScotRail 's future owners unless he gets assurances that the role of the council is written into franchising arrangements . Talks between Strathclyde and ScotRail are continuing , but if they fail , the region 's moratorium on spending could become a hard freeze , Charles Gordon , the region 's depute chairman of highways and transport , said . Mr Gordon said : ‘ If this happens we want to take projects off the shelf to keep up our level of investment , and we would have to look earlier at light rail transport schemes.’ Strathclyde has outlined a £ 250 million LRT scheme , which would link the city centre with the peripheral housing schemes Easterhouse , Castlemilk and Drumchapel . The council may also decide to invest in guided buses , latter - day trolley buses , which do not incur the heavy costs of disturbing underground cable , pipes and sewers , that a comprehensive LRT network would .",0

"The present American tendency is to ask what a country can now do for itself and for the United States , not what it might do in other circumstances , nor yet what it deserves . It is not to be expected , however , that the killing of the fatted calf for the prodigal son will evoke any more enthusiasm in his virtuous brother than it did in the scriptural parable . Australians and Chinese , who have borne the burden and heat of the day in the war imposed by Japanese aggression , naturally take a dim view of Washington 's new policy and ask how Japan is going to behave once it gets back its industrial strength . It was essential for the United States to explain to those countries which had supported the allied war effort against Japan how the dangers posed by a Japanese economic revival could be surmounted . There was much sense in the American wish to see the Japanese economy functioning efficiently again , ‘ But in Canberra , Nanking , and Manila their conversion to innocence requires to be demonstrated more convincingly than it is by the optimistic hand - outs from General MacArthur 's headquarters.’",0
"And such an explanation is needed , believe me , scarcely a key is free of its overlay of jargon — RND , STEP and NOT share keys with obscure wiggly brackets , slanty lines and arrows pointing every which way . And an elaborate ritual of key presses , in a strict order , is needed to get a key to yield the result you demand . After this the paths taken by the books change .

"Not all my school friends believed I was training an owl , so when they said things like , ‘ What 're you doing tonight then , Jon?’ I 'd say , with a wicked grin , ‘ Oh , I 'm spending the evening with me bird.’ Of course , they 'd immediately jump to the wrong conclusion and think I was talking about a girlfriend , and I 'd get some almighty teasing , but the joke was on them ! Of course , there was a more serious side to all this . It was true : I was spending every evening and night with my owl , so I was n't leading what could be considered a normal teenager 's life .",0
"Former US President Jimmy Carter and David Peterson , former Premier of the Province of Ontario , Canada , led an international team of 100 foreign observers and testified to the proper and impartial conduct of the election ( whereas previous general elections , repeatedly returning the PNC to power , had been considered seriously flawed ) . Outgoing PNC Prime Minister Hamilton Green claimed , however , that the 1992 election had been "" hijacked "" by the Elections Commission . An estimated 40,000 names on a revised electoral roll were reported to be suspect . Green himself had been turned away from a polling station in the capital , Georgetown , for lack of identity papers ; this prompted his supporters , drawn from slum districts , to go on the rampage , attacking the Commission 's headquarters and that of the PPP and looting and vandalising scores of Indian shops . At least two people were reported killed and 200 others arrested .",1

"‘ In Trevor , Chris Waddle , Viv Anderson , Chris Woods and myself we have players who 've appeared in Europe for other clubs . ‘ And many of those who have n't done that are internationals , anyway — like David Hirst , Carlton Palmer , John Sheridan , Nigel Worthington and Danny Wilson.’ Nilsson added : ‘ With a little luck I 'm sure we can go all the way .

"Here , for once , is a look at the causes and consequences of a bar - room massacre , where the gun - play is fleeting and ketchup is mostly kept in the pantry . On his talkback show , Jack Lucas , a loudmouth Manhattan DJ , castigates a popular bar for its yuppieness — itself a projection , like so much yuppie - phobia , as he 's a leader of the pack — and a maniac fan slaughters the clientele . Three years later , a suicidal Lucas meets Parry , our old friend , the idiot savant — lovestruck , optimistic and naked under the Rorschach clouds . Parry is tormented by demons . It 's a role with its antecedents in Mork — except this planet is not Ork but Manhattan 's skid row .",1
"Collegians had a slight breeze behind them in the second half , but were n't able to take control . They threatened on a couple of occasions , but their work became increasingly ragged as the game wore on . The score that opened the floodgates came out of nothing after 62 minutes . McKinty hacked through a loose ball to set up a line out just inside the Collegians half which skipper Don Whittle won . A slick transfer put Hooks clear 40 metres out and he swerved inside one defender , and ran straight through two powder puff tacks to score under the posts for Mark McCall to convert .",0

"Few will doubt that the Great White Shark 's win in Canada is good for the game , but the manner in which he won his first tournament in almost 28 months did little to dispel those nagging doubts that his temperament is susceptible to pressure . Norman must have been desperate to win after such a long absence from the winner 's circle , but that does n't account for his alarming collapse over the closing stretch in Canada . He was some three shots clear of the field standing on the 14th tee , but then lost this advantage after he recorded a double - bogey and two bogeys in the last six holes . Indeed , he had to hole from 12 feet on the 72nd to get into a sudden - death play - off with Bruce Lietzke . If the truth be told , it was Norman 's putter which kept him in the hunt down the stretch .",1
"But since literacy was already present in early Greece , at a time when the ideal consequences of literacy ( such as logic , metaphysics and objectivity ) had not yet developed , it is impossible to test the extent to which these developments were due to literacy itself . What happened between early and later Greek society to generate these developments must have been something other than the ‘ intrinsic’ qualities of literacy alone since literacy was present in both periods . To argue that the early period represents a situation of ‘ restricted’ literacy is simply to beg the question . There is a circularity in these arguments about the consequences of literacy that makes it difficult to test them out or to apply them fruitfully elsewhere . As we have traced them so far , Goody 's arguments and my counter - arguments seem to go something like this .",0
"East and south - east Europe show declines much less sharp than the industrialized north and west . An estimated German N.R.R. of 1.48 between 1907–12 , for example , had sunk to 0.98 in 1940 , while Poland , whose N.R.R. in 1927 was 1.30 , still enjoyed a rate of 1.11 in 1934 . Most east European countries seem to have had N. R. R. s of above unity for most of the years covered by this book . An example of regional differentiation within a country was Italy , where a strikingly sharper drop in fertility appeared in the north than in the south in these years . England already showed evidence of significant differences of fertility between classes in the 1880s .",1
"Nina lived in the constant expectation that a horde of paparazzi was about to burst into her office and start firing off flashbulbs .

"For them there was nothing tame about not living in the fast lane ; nothing sanctimonious about unconsciously keeping clear of the edge of the cliff . None thought of themselves as prudent — the word beloved of the philosophic writers — let alone prudes . They had no machinery for making ends meet .

"‘ Why , are n't you ready yet ?

"If Donovan is correct a bite during love - making would appear to be actual bodily harm . In Jones ( 1986 ) 83 Cr App R 375 , the Court of Appeal held that victims could consent to horseplay , which resulted in a ruptured spleen and a broken arm , though the position would be different if the accused intended to cause harm . It may be wondered whether the risk of harm outweighed the public policy behind horseplay — boys will be boys .

"Though in the last resort any conductor is an autocratic figure , Karajan 's methods of musical preparation tended to be practical and co - operative rather than formal or didactic . It has been said that he understood the psychology of an orchestra better than almost any other conductor . In the first place , his rehearsals were always scrupulously prepared ; in the second , he generally tried to ensure that the players themselves felt that they were ahead of the game . Rehearsals , older Philharmonia players recall , never overran . However pressed they were , Karajan would always contrive to finish that little bit early .",0
"They emphasised that it was the circumstances of the individual case which led them to reject charges of degrading or inhuman treatment . Wendy Costello - Roberts , who brought the case , said she was disappointed , but added : ‘ The fact that the vote of the judges was only very slightly against us does show that we were taken very seriously.’ Martin Rosenbaum , the family adviser , added : ‘ This very narrow decision by the court shows that the Government can hang on to its defence of corporal punishment only by a hair 's breadth.’ Jeremy Costello - Roberts received ‘ a slippering’ at Barnstaple , Devon , for notching up five demerit marks after talking in the school corridors and , on one occasion , being late for bed .

It also put them in a positive frame of mind for their last league game of the season , at home against bottom - of - the - table Eastleigh this Saturday . Eastleigh are without a league point to their name , with Alton a place above them on five points .",0

"The most dismal performance is by Pravda , the official party paper , of whose regular readers only 36 per cent had renewed their subscriptions . But even Ogonyok , considered the most chic and sought - after of the progressive press , is running at only 50 per cent of 1989 levels . Perhaps , as officials contend , faces will be saved by a last - minute rush to meet the new deadline . More probably , however , even the final figures will show large declines — the most telling possible proof of how the exhilaration of being able to read almost anything has been replaced by disillusion at being able to buy almost nothing . Vyacheslav Antonov , a senior official of the central press agency , Soyuzpechat , claimed yesterday that readers were merely becoming more discerning , after having snapped up everything on offer in the initial heady flush of press freedom .",0

"We consider we have done enough , ' the parish representative eventually told the inquiry . A door - to - door poll in Cannington itself showed a virtually equal number for and against Hinkley C ; a similar result was found in neighbouring Nether Stowey . Both were villages with large numbers of Hinkley workers and which , a few years before , could have been relied on to toe the company line . One example , however , came to symbolize the shift which a growing awareness of the nuclear issue had brought to this part of Somerset . This was the saga of the village of Combwich .",0

Significantly , it was written one night when Cash was sitting around at home with the likes of Bob Dylan , Joni Mitchell and Graham Nash .",0
"Having started the match eight points down from the first leg , Hemel spent the first half apparently doing everything they could to double the deficit . They almost succeeded , so that by a combination of close range misses , poor handling and half - hearted rebounding they trailed 33 - 27 at the break . Hemel 's Darin Schubring , who caused a two - hour delay in last week 's first leg when he demolished the backboard , looked less dangerous on the rare occasions he had the ball . The second half opened with Hemel threatening a stunning transformation as they outscored their opponents 9 - 2 to go one point ahead on the night and seven down overall . But the effort proved too much to sustain and Reykjavik scored the next 13 points to put the issue beyond doubt .",1

"Under the interests theory , obligations arise in order to protect economic liberty , not curtail it . Obligations figure as side constraints upon economic activity which respect the inviolability of other persons . Yet , when we dig a little deeper , we find simply another style of moral paternalism lies buried beneath the surface . We should first note , however , that the ' harm to interests ' theory , as we have stated it , remains radically incomplete , for it lacks a theory of personal responsibility . The question is when should a person be under a duty to compensate others for harm to their interests .",0

"It had smelled blood , fresh blood . The man in the shadows waved something green and glistening , and the waft of entrails touched the cat 's sensitive nostrils and made it sit up and watch the stranger . After a moment , curiosity and hunger got the better of it , and it walked easily , almost indifferently , towards the dark corner where the fresh meat beckoned . When the bloody offal was slapped onto the concrete path before it , the cat hesitated only briefly before running towards this welcome offering , and beginning to chew greedily at the soft , tasty guts . It was so absorbed in its feast that it ignored the soft approach of the man who had treated it so kindly , and could do no more than scratch and struggle as it was grasped by the neck , and lifted from the ground , its belly exposed to the flashing steel blade of a fish knife .",0
"Because such systems do not take into account the variation in individuals , they are generally only of interest to the classicist . Ideals also vary , and the view of what constitutes perfect bodily proportions changes from one generation to the next . When drawing from memory , however , it is useful to have a handy , rule - of - thumb checking device to gauge such proportions as arm - length or head - size . The usual modern method is to use the vertical length of the head as a unit of measurement .

"Tim Robbins ' writing - directing debut is amazingly ambitious . It starts off as a satire of Pennebaker 's Dylan doc Do n't Look Back and — cut to the pace of Roberts ' twangy crap folk songs — also attacks Saturday Night Live , rock ' n ' roll , right - wingers , and stupid people . Bob Roberts himself is a monster never quite accessible to the cameras or us , vilifiable only by off - the - cuff remarks ( ' Do n't take crack , kids … it 's a ghetto drug ' ) , and opposed only by Bugs Raplin ( Esposito ) , a wired outsider - hack linking him to every scandal of the ' 80s in a string of fact - filled rants . It 's these lectures which finally unbalance Bob Roberts , which shifts from crisp satire to stodgy tract under the sheer density of Robbins ' disgust with US politics , losing along the way the warped rock ' n'roll and documentary trappings which give bite to the first film intelligent enough to see assassination as a career move for the victim . Bob Roberts is also the first UK film in years to ' fail ' for being stuffed with too many ideas , marking Robbins as a fresh and major talent .",0
"The first from play and the second from a penalty and both combined to provide Monaghan with the incentive they needed after Cavan had threatened to overrun them . Noone epitomised this threat more than Ronan Carolan who helped himself to ten of Cavan 's points — a generous haul by any standards . But Monaghan proved that they still have a sizeable heart . Gene McGurk , Frank McEneaney , Bernie Murray , Loughman all played with typical ferocity as they strove to orchestrate a smash and grab act following Cavan 's early dominance . Monaghan came close to snatching victory but this would have been rough justice on Cavan who showed flair and fluency in the first half before fading .",0

"The Government 's official secrets legislation in 1989 was guillotined after only two days in committee in the lower House . Discussion on the Prevention of Terrorism Bill 1989 was also arbitrarily curtailed . The control of Parliament is perhaps even better illustrated by the fact that few pieces of legislation have been lost in the Commons in the ten years since Mrs Thatcher became prime minister — the Shops Bill comes to mind , but there is talk of its reintroduction in a future session . A whole series of laws bears the personal imprint of the Prime Minister — the abolition of the Greater London Council , the poll tax , identity cards for football supporters , to name but a few . All that unpopularity in the country or in the Commons manages to achieve is a revolt by a handful of predictable Tory rebels , a few careful speeches about the need to present policy better , and a vague anxiety about the results of an election not due to be held for years .",0

She stared out of the window and saw the stars and a bright moon . And near by she heard the howling of the wolves .

"True , the 1963 Act that followed the Report was only narrowly defined — to prevent admissions to care or court appearances — and local authority powers were strictly limited . But it had a profound effect on the child care service of the time . It opened the floodgates to a deluge of referrals , altered the whole balance of its work and confronted it with the enormity of ‘ need’ in terms of family poverty and homelessness . Faced with such demand and having only limited powers and minimal resources the service was quickly forced on the defensive , making invidious distinctions between those who were amenable to ( deserving of ) help and those who were not . The days of the ‘ coercive children 's officer’ had arrived ( Handler , 1968 ) .",0

Split roles can encompass an infinite variety of divisions of authority from an - all powerful chairman to an all - powerful chief executive , while the middle ground carries the risks of confused roles , blurred leadership and personality clashes .",0
"A single order may not be sufficient for this latter aim , and it is advisable to go back to the shelves some months after the new stock has reached them and decide whether a further order is necessary . The amount of funding available determines how far this process can be taken .

A suggested rule of thumb might be 1 % of the population aged 65–74 , 10 % of the population aged 75–84 and 25 % of the population aged over 85 would have moderate / severe dementia .

"Cost : approx £ 10,000 . At St Mary 's , in Paddington , west London , a senior manager , Ian Robertson , said he thought identifiable unpaid bills were costing the hospital about £ 250,000 a year .

That is all they have to do,’ he said .",0
"Today good , unconverted barns in his area sell for about £ 75,000 . ‘ But the cost of buying and converting a barn is higher than building something from scratch,’ says Wood . There is no real rule of thumb for how much it costs to convert a barn . ‘ To be on the safe side , double the price for the cost of converting,’ says Marcus Lyon of William H Brown in Malton , North Yorkshire . ‘ You could hope to convert a £ 125,000 barn for Pounds 80,000 , but by the time you move in you would probably find you have spent nearer the cost price of the barn.’",0

"NEWPORT BEACH – It has been raised more than 70 times in the last 50 years , mostly without commotion .

"Herbs can be started from small plants ; planting in spring is again the most convenient time .

If the plants are barerooted , spread the roots out in the hole , with the same proviso regarding the long ones , and then crumble soil in over them to fill the hole . Make them firm in their place , and water them unless the soil is really wet , or heavy rain is imminent . Space all of them appropriately for their final size , and put in stakes wherever support may be needed .",1
Ben Bacon KINGSTONIAN boss Chris Kelly let rip with his famous lip last night in an astonishing attack on the Football Association .

"McClellan 's work furnishes basic formulae for calculations of this kind . Such formulae are complex and not easily resolved since the relevant factors can not all be readily equated , and in any case are not all quantifiable . Briefly , these factors are : the total population of the area and the number of registered library members ; trends in book publishing — i.e. the number of new books published per annum , broken down by subjects ; the length of life of stock on the open shelves ( depreciation rate ) ; the risen costs of books and binding on the previous year 's fund ; and the range and condition of the existing stock . Major changes of policy or new developments in an authority may also affect funding for materials — as , for instance , at the opening of a new service point . However , stock purchased for growth or expansion is normally regarded as capital expenditure and is therefore not considered for the purposes of recurrent funding .",1
"Where there is a conflict between the register and the certificate , the former is stronger prima facie evidence than the latter but neither is decisive ; ownership of the shares depends on who is entitled to be registered . Suppose , say , that A , who is registered and is entitled to be registered , loses his certificate , obtains a duplicate from the company and transfers to B who is registered by the company . Subsequently A finds the original certificate and , either because he has forgotten about the sale to B or because he is a rogue , then purports to sell the shares to C. The company will rightly refuse to register C whose only remedy will be against A ( who may by this time be a man - of - straw ) unless he can successfully invoke against the company the so - called doctrine of estoppel by share certificate . A share certificate will contain two statements on which the company will know that reliance may be placed . The first is the extent to which the shares to which it relates are paid up .",0
"This is not the case . Nevertheless I have since been informed by Richard Buckley that ( if the concept is not entirely meaningless in the circumstances ) the Co - op gives ‘ the best value for money’ , in terms of materials used in their coffins and the general finish and quality of the handles and name - plate etc . Mr Hodgson explained that in buying up so many small firms , who really could no longer make ends meet , he , Howard Hodgson , could do better and cheaper funerals and that no one need worry about the cost any way , because if the deceased or whoever was taking the responsibility of next - of - kin possessed less than £ 300 , the DHSS would pay for the whole thing . ( This figure has now been increased to £ 500 . ) When he finally paused for breath , I said , ‘ Hold on a moment’ and explained that , although obviously nobody wants to spend more than they have to on anything , in my case it was a matter of principle , because I wanted my husband 's funeral to be a personal affair in which he would be ministered to by his loved - ones , not strangers .",0

"I mean teaching is a demanding job , is n't it . Now how can you cope as teachers with a school in which you are almost on call to all the population twenty four hours of the day , which is , it seems to me , what you 're saying ? With difficulty , but I think it is fair to say as well it has got great compensations , because if you build walls , if you 're hiding , if you 're pretending , if you 're always subscribing parents and stopping them from coming in you make problems ; parents worry and suspect that there are problems behind those closed doors , and I think this is why we have established fifteen different parent teacher groups which meet regularly in different parts of Sussex , from Seaford to Shoreham , to Hove , to Brighton , and in small groups of ten / fifteen / twenty they 'll sit down with a teacher and they do n't just do fund raising they thrash out the different aspects of their children 's education and then they come in and meet in a main committee and I think it is this involvement that enables the parents and the teachers to work very closely together . I think , too , if you know your students , if you meet them outside the classroom in activities , then it makes life in the classroom as well . There is a tremendous spin - off from one to the other .",0

"The goal deluge at St James 's Park brought home the need to counter the effects of the new offside law which came into force that summer and which reduced from three to two the number of players required to be between an opposing attacker and goal when the ball was last played . The change was aimed at reducing stoppages for offside , which in the 1920s were the cause of much monotony as full - backs played further and further upfield . The revised law opened the scoring floodgates . In the last season before its introduction , 4,700 goals were scored in the League ; during the next season the number went up to 6,373 .

"In fact in recent visits to schools I have been struck increasingly , not only by the ' over - age ' children but by the considerable number of very young ones , conveniently parked in classrooms so that mothers could take employment , trade or visit . Two other factors often at variance with official statistics are attendance and repeating . Registers tend to be filled in , often to a pattern , sometimes in advance , whereas actual attendance , particularly in rural areas may be far more sporadic than indicated , while in certain communities ( as with nomads such as the Kenya Turkana or Moslem communities suspicious of the corrupting influence of western schools on their children ) it is not uncommon to find considerable numbers of pupils who are on the roll , but attend sporadically and unwillingly . For such,(and I have very clear pictures of them sitting illiterate and uncomprehending in the back of classes ) , school attendance is merely a sort of ' protection money ' to pacify inquisitive authorities . At the other end of the scale one finds the hard pressed teacher or headmaster , besieged by parents , yet limited to a certain class size by government regulation ( or even by the number of spaces in his register page ) .",1

"Piquantly , all these are far more luminous than Sirius ; Delta , over 900 light - years away , could match over 100000 Suns .

There is however one splendid open cluster , M41 , which is easily visible with the naked eye and is resolvable with × 20 binoculars ; various individual stars can be seen with lower magnifications . It lies in the same field as the rather reddish Nu&sup2;(3.9 ) , forming a triangle with Nu&sup2 ; and Sirius . The brightest star in it is of the seventh magnitude , and is orange , with a K - type spectrum .",1

There was a game they 'd played a few times when Edith was out of the house , a rough - and - tumble sort of thing , perfectly harmless . There was Blind Man 's Buff , and a thing called Find the Penny , in which he himself stood like a statue in the centre of the sitting - room while the boy searched him all over , rifling through his pockets for a hidden coin .

"The WEA received unstinted praise for upholding ‘ two precious ingredients of education in a free society : objective discussion , free from propaganda or indoctrination , of social and economic problems ; and the full participation of the student in organising and conducting classes’ . The Report echoed some of the criticism advanced by witnesses that the WEA could not decide on its future and , at least in some Districts , had lost the pioneering spirit , but concluded nonetheless that ‘ voluntaryism as exemplified by the Workers’ Educational Association is essential if the spirit of adult education is to be preserved ' . It therefore recommended that the WEA should continue as a teaching as well as an organising body , while suggesting that some increase in financial contributions from voluntary sources ‘ would materially help to preserve its independence and its status as a voluntary body’— a hint that the WEA could not expect to rely too heavily on government or local authority aid and that its members and friends must continue to dig deep into their pockets . As with the WEA , so in its treatment of adult education as a whole , the Report was cautious , considered , fairly conservative in tone . It recognised that , with educational provision as a whole in a transitional phase , still recovering from the war and still adjusting to the requirements of the 1944 Act , it was inappropriate to ‘ set a course for adult education over the rest of this century’ : ‘ our recommendations apply to the present transitional period’ .",0

"However , on Oct. 30 , the Bush camp was shaken by fresh revelations concerning the Iran - contra affair . Grand jury documents relating to the forthcoming trial of former Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger showed that , at a Reagan Cabinet meeting in January 1986 , Bush had voted in favour of secretly selling missiles to Iran in exchange for the release of US hostages held by pro - Iranian groups in Lebanon . The new evidence contradicted Bush 's claims that he was "" out of the loop "" of those who approved the Iran - contra operation and that , when he did discover the arms deal , he was unaware of its quid pro quo element in regard to the hostages . Clinton used the revelation to accuse Bush of having lied to the public and , thereby , of having diminished the credibility of the presidency . Bush had emphasized heavily throughout the campaign the issues of trust and character , and this latest revelation appeared to be particularly damaging to him ; opinion poll evidence suggested that , at the end of October , Clinton was once again opening up a lead .",0

"Time and again between then and the UN deadline of January 15th , he could have averted the allied counter - offensive that followed . Last week , for the first time , he showed he was ready to contemplate withdrawal — but not unequivocally . Had he shown himself unambiguously ready to start pulling out , the coalition would have surely had to offer him something , if not to save his face , at least to cover his backside : an American commitment to talk about any Middle Eastern issue whatsoever has already been given ; the call for Iraqi reparations could still be waived .

"The Reformation In the early sixteenth century the Reformation made considerable progress amongst the Slovenes , and Protestant schools and churches were established in Laibach ( Ljubljana ) and other Slovene towns . Although the Habsburg - led Counter - Reformation eventually extinguished this movement , it bore fruits which were of enduring significance in the cultural history of the Slovenes . In 1555 Primož Trubar made the first translation of the New Testament into Slovene and in 1584 a Slovene grammar was produced . The works of Trubar and his collaborators were printed in Germany and circulated not only amongst Slovenes but also amongst Croats and Serbs .",0

"If the rug becomes too dry , which can happen in centrally - heated or air - conditioned rooms , the fibres of the pile material may become brittle and consequently more prone to damage and wear . On the other hand , if the rug is allowed to remain damp over a protracted period , the colours may run and , more seriously , mildew may form and cause permanent damage to the foundation or pile . Shampooing an expensive , old or delicate item should preferably be undertaken by a specialist company — most reputable dealers and shops offer this service — but avoid the more general carpet - cleaning companies , as the techniques and chemicals used on synthetic wall - to - wall carpets may not be suitable . Shampooing can be undertaken at home using a good quality wool detergent , with perhaps a cup of vinegar in a dilute solution , which should be applied gently with a sponge or cloth after the rug has been cleansed . The rug should then be carefully and systematically dried , making sure that there are no pockets of dampness in either the foundation or pile , by leaving it out in the sun and then methodically going over the entire area , both back and front , with a hand - held hair dryer .",1

"But of course what they mean by involvement varies from one teacher to another , erm and there are certain limits which most teachers feel that they should put on parental involvement . For example , when you 're thinking of young children learning to read , teachers like parents to read to their children at home and look at books with them at home . erm They do n't like them to buy copies of the school reading scheme and keep it at home and go through it book by book , that they feel is encroaching on their professionalism . Do you think , in fact , Michael , that , that parents actually can do harm to their children by insisting on being involved in their teaching at too early a stage , for example by forcing their children to read ?

"Since the quarrel which put the kingdoms of France and England at odds with each other was based upon historical differences , it was only reasonable that history should also have been used both to emphasise the differences between them , and to allow each to show itself how its own history and its own characteristics had developed . By treating his subject as widely as possible , by seeing it in terms of the history of war , rather than as the more narrowly defined military history , the modern student will come to understand it in its many facets and complexities . In so doing he may come as near as he can ever hope to an understanding of war as people of the late Middle Ages knew it , no easy task even in the most favourable conditions , but one which can not be attempted with any hope of success without a proper appreciation of the many threads which make up history . Not the least is the role which individuals played in war . Without them , there can be no history .",1

"These meetings can provide an opportunity to be sociable and to exchange views and experiences as they arise , and can help to reduce tension and the feeling that you alone have the monopoly on making elementary mistakes . Keeping up to date with developments in your own specialty can go a long way to adding to your confidence . Attempting to get to grips with all the developments in nursing over the past five years is meat enough for any expert , and you will not be regarded as letting the side down just because you are not familiar with all the latest terminology or research in your clinical specialty . You will be expected to become more involved in teaching within your own clinical setting but this does not mean that you have to prepare lectures or notes in advance . Much more is made these days of adding to existing experience and finding solutions to individual problems of patients rather than attempting to apply nursing practice to clinical symptoms and multiple medical diagnosis .",0
"All in all it was an excellent performance by North Down in the field , limiting the North West side to after they had won an important toss . But they wasted a good position at to two to lose the next eight for runs , the North Down bowlers sharing the wickets evenly . McCrum had his eye on a century when he cruelly slipped at the crease and was run out , but his stand of for the second wicket with John Gilliland , who made 32 , put his side firmly in the driving seat . Condemn Robin Haire and Adrian Semple made sure of knocking off the remaining runs , leaving them with an over and a half to spare .",0

"During the war these derelict pits were used for various purposes ; Lee 's or Houlder pit became a bomb and ammunition store for the R.A.F.

The Cam pit also became a training area for the Army , being used for weapon training and exercise in the firing of live ammunition . Boys will be boys and in spite of warnings at least one fatal accident occurred involving local lads , and several were injured . Bores Hole was used as an air raid shelter , or rather the tunnel that led under the road was , and many tales could be told of nights spent under there during the air raids . Living on chalk is a mixed blessing , on the one hand the cement industry provides work for many local people and with the mechanisation of farming methods this has meant that what was at one time an agriculture community is now largely dependant upon local industries .",0
"They are effective , yes , but like gassing they can almost be eliminated if we use our sporting methods with greater skill . The sportsman chooses between rough shooting ; a combination of ferreting and shooting or netting ; the day and night netting of rough rabbits ; and the use of running dogs , such as lurchers for example , both in daylight and after dark , the latter , since lights are used , being known as lamping . I include netting as a sport since in my view , it is undoubtedly that but it is also a very professional method of getting to grips with the stock . There is the option between day and night netting , when rabbits are flushed forward and are driven into standing nets in which they become entangled . Net systems can extend from as little as 50 yards ( 45.7 metres ) to as long as is manageable .",0

"Although the increase was understandable given the Government 's vacillation , it made ministers even less willing to intervene . In one sense , Mentmore was a lost cause even before we began . Academic opinion was divided as to the merits of the house ; and Lady Birk , the minister involved , was constantly to refer to ‘ other voices’ who whispered behind closed doors that the house was not worth saving . But the outcome was to demonstrate forcefully that you should never shy away from a fight for fear of losing . Not only may a campaign raise public awareness of the issues involved and win you new supporters , but the sheer relentlessness of pressure and eventual embarrassment at being seen to do nothing may also prompt parliament or Government to introduce new policies .",0

"By ' the abolition of the subject ' Althusser means the abolition of the intentional subject whose desires , motives , and beliefs are cited as the explanation of social events and states of affairs . And since persons are the primary locus of intentional properties , his main target is the traditional conception of individual agents , so central to individualism , which was discussed in Chapter III . Rather than being regarded as actors who make their own history , individuals are to be seen as the ' supports ' of social practices who maintain and reproduce them . As Althusser puts it : This is not to deny , of course , that individuals are causal subjects ; they fill various social roles , engage in the work of production , and thereby bring about changes in the social world .",0

"In particular it relies on estimating the final cost of the investment , the amount and timing of returns , the rate of return on the alternative investment ( the ' hurdle rate ' ) and the rate of real deterioration of items of productive capital . Even if used sensibly , capital - budgeting procedures will tend to discourage major initiatives and indicate strategies aimed at short - term returns . In practice , hopelessly unrealistic assumptions and expectations are often built into these ' analyses ' , like payback periods of three years or less , and very high , rule - of - thumb hurdle rates that bear no relation to the real cost of capital to the business or actual rates achievable from external placements . ( Net present value calculations can , however , be bent the other way , to justify massive strategic overkill with catastrophic socio - economic — and political — consequences .

"The older one was that of the Evangelicals and Dissenters , of whom more will be written in chapter three .

As yet she was an unknown quantity , a mysterious figure who kept her distance from subordinate staff and was infrequently seen and then either alone or with one or several of the Senior Management team . ’ The Queen Bee to end the syndrome,’said Geoff .",0
"In other words if you , you 've been a teacher and you 're working in a school , you tend to talk about the things about your school that different from other schools , not about the things about your school that are the same , and that go on in all the other schools as well . And yet , from a , any visitor from a , another country or another planet would notice much more the things were the same , than the things were different . So parents tend not to hear about the things that really go on a lot of the time in nearly all schools and they do hear a bit about the things that are a little bit different , so they can get quite a distorted picture of , of what 's going on . In fact there was a , I think some of the recent erm concerns about schools have come from an image that 's been built up over a period of time that the schools spend very little time on the , on the three Rs for example . And we found that many parents were inclined to believe these kinds of reports , and yet this just was n't true if one saw what was going on in the schools .",0
"The more risks you have the more important it is to do something about your blood cholesterol level . Risk factors for heart disease do not just add up , they multiply . A cigarette smoker has twice the risk of having a heart attack than a non - smoker . A combination of high blood pressure and raised blood cholesterol concentration increases the risk fourfold , add smoking to that and the risk becomes eightfold . So , a person with a higher than normal cholesterol concentration carries a relatively low risk if he / she does not smoke , has low blood pressure , is not overweight , exercises regularly and has no history of heart disease in the family .",1

"When the sturdy Hollywood , who soldiers in the trenches with the modest St. Michael 's club in Newtownhamilton , was plucked from the ' extras ' the last rites were being administered to Armagh 's championship hopes . They then trailed buoyant Fermanagh by 0–13 to 1–4 and were in danger of not only losing the match but the remnants of their pride and prestige as well . The self - inflicted loss of Dominic Clarke following an off the ball incident in the second minute had left Armagh dicing with death and the killer blows subsequently rained in mainly from the accurate boot of Raymond Gallagher — remember what I said about him at Minor level last week ? — and the deadly finishing of Mark Gallagher and Malachy O'Rourke . But for Gerard Houlahan 's supreme skill in driving home Armagh 's first goal in the 25th minute the orchard county would surely have been dead and gone by the interval instead of trailing by just one point at 0–7 to 1–3 . Their fate , it seemed , had merely been delayed replaced the out of touch Ollie Reel — Armagh haemorrhaged even further by slumping to 1–15 to 1–6 .",0

Fortunately , as it turned out , shyness got the better of me and I stayed put .

"I had what I suspected to be ‘ shin soreness’ , inflammation where the tendon meets the bone , and for which rest is the only cure . To walk was to risk breaking it , but there could be no more than an overnight stop before Adrar , the end of the macadam and the last supply point before open desert . I ambled intentionally slowly , hiding my wrist - watch in my pocket , in case I damaged the leg further through impatience and hurrying . In spite of taking my time , the wheelbarrow fell over every couple of minutes , when balancing required the left leg to take the strain . I was cold into the bargain , and when I was dropping my shorts , I overbalanced because of the painful shin , and soiled myself and my clothes with diarrhoea .",1
"On the one hand , X and Y are human beings with beliefs and aims , and we are interested in what is in their heads . On the other hand , their situation is structured , and ( ' holism ' here standing for the idea that the parts of a whole behave as the whole requires ) we are interested in the social constraints on their actions . Both pulls are strong and theories which purport to reconcile them tend to be fragile , even though they capture a stout commonsense conviction that , as Marx put it , ' Men make their own history but they do not make it just as they please ; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves . ' But let us suppose that there are theories robust enough to hold the tension . The contrast shows up in the different notions of ' social capacity ' .",0

"For a man who always looks so morose when batting —‘I know I look a miserable sod out there , but I ca n't help it,’ he once said — and whose captaincy had previously seemed rather ordinary , it was a revelation . No one could have doubted that West Indies would fight back . Yet England had played so well that , equally , there was no reason to think it would prove to be a flash in the pan . The series was alight — only for it to be thoroughly dampened in Guyana when relentless rain washed out the second Test completely , for only the fifth time in Test history . Would this mean that England had lost their momentum ?",0
"Otherwise , he says , he finds it incredible that the cardinals , monks , nuns , Swiss Guards and the ascetic curates of the Sistine Chapel should be managing per head , per day , 3 lb of beef , the equivalent of 12 large beefburgers .

"In February 1915 the National Union Executive refused to sanction a scheme to use the party agents to find recruits , since it "" might savour of compulsion "" and in April the Committee refused to debate a motion on compulsory service because of the party truce . In September , the Executive asked to meet Bonar Law to discuss the subject , now that Unionists were in government , but Law refused any outside discussion until the cabinet had made up its mind . Throughout the winter of 1915–16 , Law played for time and stalled demands for a meeting of the Central Council , while Unionist ministers pressed the party case in cabinet . Party opinion was mollified by the Derby Scheme of November 1915 , whereby the agents and activists of both parties were used to canvass for recruits ; the party organization was turned over entirely to recruiting and the scheme cost the party £ 29,000 . By February 1916 pressure was mounting again , and resolutions calling for compulsory national service were flowing in ; the Executive refused to debate them , but passed them on to Law nevertheless .",0
"Home Office guidelines suggested that refugees from religious , racial or political persecution had the strongest case for a C registration . The tribunals began their work in October 1939 . Since they met behind closed doors and no provision was made for legal representation , decisions were heavily dependent on the sensitivity of individual chairmen . Not surprisingly , their deliberations revealed wild inconsistencies . In Leeds , aliens of whatever background were given a B label , whereas in Manchester they were designated grade C. Several tribunals put the unemployed into B category , telling them to apply for a transfer to C when they found jobs .",0

Disappointment that Feargal was n't the man she had thought him had been replaced by a sadness for things not to be .

"Urban 's pro - French foreign policy during the Thirty Years War had left him in an exposed position when Richelieu joined forces with Protestant Sweden to thwart the restoration of Catholicism in Germany . Instead of condemning the alliance , Urban insisted that the war was one of state , not of religion , inviting the criticism that he was putting political expediency before religious necessity . It is not impossible that his severity on Galileo was one way of saving face — an attempt to placate prominent Jesuits still smarting from wounds that Galileo had inflicted on their colleagues in earlier debates about the nature of sunspots and comets . Relationships had been soured by Galileo 's protracted debate with Horatio Grassi , the leading mathematician of the Jesuit College in Rome , who had followed Tycho Brahe in treating comets as real , self - luminous bodies located beyond the moon — in contrast to Galileo 's theory that they were merely optical effects , produced by the reflection of sunlight in thin vapors . And there had been a long - standing feud with Christopher Scheiner , who had incensed Galileo by borrowing his telescopic discoveries for his own ends .",0

"With one hand she cleared away from under her the sharp stones of the unpaved road . She was clutching one in her hand ; its edge dug into her palm . She was glad she had the stone , when he came into the byre ; she was waiting for him as he had asked her to , she had made her way across the orchard in the fresh blue morning and let herself in through the wooden door by lifting it off its hinges , since the bolt had rusted fast long ago , and she had looked up at the full moon of the sky in the chimney hole at the centre of the round shelter 's roof , and with her stone which was sharp as a shearing knife with a bright , honed blade the marks of the whetstone were still visible in pale striations like scouring tracks — she scraped her name into one of the stones on the interior , as many others had done before her , in tall shapely capitals , the only letters she knew . Except that it was n't her name that she carved into the yielding stone , but her sister 's . She wrote ' ROSALBA ' , for indeed it was Rosalba who was there , holding the kitchen knife in her hand as Tommaso came through the door .",1
"Loving the Jesus way is explained a lot more fully in the Bible , in 1 Corinthians 13:1–8 .

I may have the gift of inspired preaching ; I may have all knowledge and understand all secrets ; I may have all the faith needed to move mountains — but if I have no love , I am nothing . I may give away everything I have , and even give up my body to be burned — but if I have no love this does me no good .

"The seventh bit is a parity bit , and the eighth is known as the word mark bit ; by the usual definition , this computer therefore has a 7-bit word . Each operand is a string of one or more consecutive characters . In order to facilitate arithmetic , an operand is specified by the address of its right - hand ( least - significant ) character , and the left - hand ( most - significant ) character of the operand is indicated by having its word mark bit set to one . Because operands may be very long , no accumulator is provided on this computer ; all operations take place between operands in the store .

"This bill will give much more autonomy to those people who are delivering the care to patients on the ground,’ he said . The shadow Health Secretary , Mr Robin Cook , said Labour was fundamentally opposed to the principle of the bill and would vote against it because it would destroy the public sector ethos of the NHS and was designed to do so . The bill claimed to be ‘ putting the patient in the driving seat’ , but it did not even allow patients to be consulted if a hospital decided to opt out of regional health authority control , he said . It claimed it would ensure that money in the health service ‘ followed the patient’ , which Labour was not opposed to , but in fact the bill meant the patient would have to follow the money and the contracts . It claimed patients would have more choice over which hospital they went to , but in fact they would have less because they would have to go to the hospital with which their district health authority had placed a contract , he said .",0
"This idea was inspired by Geoff 's round - the- world travels as a professional jazz musician . ‘ I was with a band called Muscles until 1978,’ he explains , ‘ and while we were on tour in Madrid I noticed the effect of hanging pictures from a brass rail in one of the hotels we stayed in . Unfortunately , I could n't get the pictures to hang correctly in my kitchen , so I decided to improvise and use pots and pans instead.’ As Geoff says , travelling the world and staying in so many different places — from châteaux in France to hotels in Bangkok — has certainly influenced his choice of decor and design throughout the house . In the dining room , for instance , there 's a strong Eastern influence .",1

"But such Machiavellian gestures on the part of a benevolent ruler increasingly cut less ice with the people . After 1981 , the Securitate and other security forces were used as the prime means of settling industrial disputes and demonstrations . It was not surprising that even within the upper reaches of the Party discontent began to come into the open , or at least to be expressed clearly behind closed doors at meetings of the Central Committee or Council of Ministers . By 1981 , Virgil Trofin had been downgraded , like so many former protégés , and was now Minister of Mines and Petroleum . Suddenly , at the Central Committee meeting in November , he failed to respond to the criticisms levelled at his ministry for failure to meet plan targets in the standard manner , neither would he take the blame for the strike at Motru .",0
"By the closing years of the war the pacific complement of all this military collectivism was the preparation for social reconstruction with the onset of peace , carried out by the state and pursued with the assistance of its own investigative committees . Once lodged in the realm of ' common sense ' and sustained by ' practical'measures , state collectivism looked less and less like contestable belief , and became increasingly the broad starting point for argument , rather than its disputed conclusion . But plans for post - war reconstruction were to bear only limited fruit . Although the promise of a ' land fit for heroes to live in ' secured a victory for Lloyd George and his coalition government in 1918 , it was soon to find its promises increasingly hard to fulfil as the post - war boom petered out and Britain moved into the years of the Slump . Even before the ' Geddes axe ' cut a swathe through the ambitious post - war housing programme and halted the further extension of welfare provision in such areas as education , a certain faltering in the reconstructivist drive was evident .",0

This is one reason why it has become routine among Christian writers to warn against a god - of - the - gaps . Past precedents indicate that conflict will assuredly arise , if statements about God are used to fill the gaps in scientific explanation .",0

"There , Muffat recalls , he had heard , some while earlier , several of Corelli 's concertos played by a great number of instrumental players . But though Muffat entered into details concerning continuo grouping he does not tell us precisely how many musicians were involved in the performances . Greater light is shed on this aspect by the account books of Corelli 's patrons , Pamphili and Ottoboni which list all the musicians employed by their respective households . Using the list as a basis , the two directors Chiara Banchini and Jesper Christensen have fielded an orchestra of 16 violins , five violas , six cellos , five basses , four archlutes , a chitarrone , harpsichord and organ . This is more than twice the size of Trevor Pinnock 's English Concert ( Archiv ) , for example , and substantially larger than Sigiswald Kuijken 's Petite Bande ( Deutsche Harmonia Mundi ) .",1

"When , however , some of the classes were put into single - sex groups , the girls in these groups started to score more highly again , while the girls in the mixed sex groups fell further behind . Deem and Finch ( 1986 ) have argued , on this basis , that women should be entitled to a single - sex higher education . This does beg the question , however , of the extent to which education , and higher education in particular , exists in isolation from the rest of society . Subject choice , knowledge and curriculum So far , we have seen that feminists are beginning to agree on what happens to girls in mixed - sex schools ; there is a growing consensus in research that education is a powerful force in shaping relations of dominance and subordinance between the sexes .",0
"The chemicals used in these machines have no influence whatsoever on disinfection . Bactericidal agents may , however , suppress the appearance of a pinkish bloom of bacterial origin , Micrococcus roseus , in the wash compartment , which would otherwise require separate disinfection . As a rule of thumb guide , to the effectiveness of a machine , items coming out should be visibly clean and too hot to handle with comfort . Because of the corrosive nature of some machine washing agents some care should be exercised on items selected for this form of disinfection . Wooden handled tools , composite rubber or polyethylene materials and aluminium will suffer .",0
"Ciccolini tends to adopt slow tempos here — too slow , I feel , in the initial étude ' for the five fingers ' , and in those for fourths octaves ( not emporté here ) , and chords , and much too deliberate in the one ' for the eight fingers ' which is n't molto leggiero e legato . On the other hand , he does encompass the notes with consistent authority and there is a slightly dour quality about the playing which does grow on me . I would n't want this version of the Etudes as the only one on my shelves , but it earns a place alongside other ( note , too , that these discs are available separately ) . I do notice one or two places , though , where Ciccolini departs form the Durand text — e.g. he plays the fourth and sixth quarte of the study in fourths as E and A instead of G and C , and the second quaver in bar 10 of the final ' chords ' study is a G minor chord where G major is printed ( though we get G major in the reprise at 4′18″ ) . It may be that Ciccolini is following the new Debussy edition made by Roy Howat ( which I have not seen ) , since that scholar is responsible for the English note .",1

"Workers could conceivably mistake a rise in money wages for a rise in real wage à la Friedman ( 1968 ) , but the Friedman speculation only makes sense if employers think ( perhaps mistakenly ) that the real wage rate has fallen to a level such as in Figure 6.10 . The island parable focuses not upon the reactions of workers and employers to what may turn out to be imaginary variations in the real wage rate but upon the reactions of producers to variations in the prices being paid for their products . This begs the question : do producers respond only to perceived changes in the prices paid for their products in comparison to those paid for other products irrespective of what is happening to their costs of production ? Take the case of the inhabitants of an island who mistakenly think that the price which the rest of the economy is prepared to pay for its output has risen . In the absence of further information to the contrary , we are justified in assuming that money wages and the prices of non - labour inputs have also risen in proportion to the rise in price of final output .",0

"We have all been brought up in awe of Sir Robert Walpole , regarding that continuous spell of his in office from 1714 to 1741 as a model of the politician 's craft but aware of the paradox that public opinion at last broke through the barriers of a corrupted and corruptible and minuscule electorate to overthrow him . I have been guilty myself of telling electors , sceptical of their power , about how popular resentment brought down ‘ even Walpole’ and forced a reluctant government into an unwanted war . Sir Ian painstakingly worked over the evidence for this from decade to weary decade — and drew a blank . In those Whig - dominated years he found that England was preponderantly not Whig but Tory ; he found that a corruption - wielding establishment could win elections only in the , numerically preponderant , boroughs and even then only at the cost of an enormously expensive patronage machine . As for the prevalence of sentiment — Jacobite , Anglican , non - Juring or simply straight Tory — he found that , given a minimum of competence and any serious support from France , the Pretenders should have sent the Hanoverians packing on the heels of James II .",0

"Mohammed has expanded his trade into other Arab countries , notably Saudi Arabia , where business is booming for middlemen . As with most arms dealers payola — commission or bribes — is the key to his living . There would be no reason for Mohammed 's existence if every minister and ministry were above board : arms dealers are used either because deals are shady — circumventing arms embargoes for example— or to allow government officials a healthy ( illegal ) cut . ‘ There is no normal way to get into the arms trade’ , says Mohammed . ‘ It 's all based on one 's proximity to those in power.’",0

"In these raids there were no human casualties in any of the deaf centres , although a few deaf families were made homeless when their homes were hit . The deaf in Exeter occupied temporary premises for a few weeks , before settling into another building near the centre of the town , but not for very long . In early 1943 , four Heinkel 111s made a low - level sneak raid on the town in broad daylight . The raid took less than five minutes , but the damage suffered by Exeter was greater than it had suffered in the Baedeker raids , and there was greater loss of life , over 250 people being killed . One of the buildings totally flattened was the new home of the deaf in the town , so for the second time within the space of one year , the deaf in Exeter had to find new club premises .",0
"However , it seems rather unnecessary to introduce the negative sentence ( 2b ) into a consideration of the relationship between ( 2a ) and ( 2c ) which arises in the conversation presented earlier in ( I ) . Though it may not be common knowledge that the speaker has an uncle , it is what Grice ( 1981 : 190 ) terms ' noncontroversial ' information . Moreover , since the speaker chose to say my uncle rather than I have an uncle and he … ,we must assume she did n't feel the need to assert the information . What she appears to be asserting is that this person is coming home from Canada . Given this assertion , the idea that we should consider the denial of this assertion in order to find out whether there is a presupposition in what the speaker has not asserted seems particularly counterintuitive .",1
"Was it normal , she had enquired , for elderly gentlemen making termly investigations into your scholastic progress to indicate where you were to sit for interview by laying their hand on the sofa cushion , and then , when you sat down , failing to remove their hand ? I acquainted the Principal with the burden of my reply to Rosa : I had explained that it was less a question of manners than of physiology , and that extreme decrepitude and senescence did often lead to withering of the bicep and tricep muscles , which in turn led to a breakdown in the chain of command from cerebral GHQ to courting finger . Only later , I told the now somewhat quivering Principal , only later , when Rosa had gone , did it come to mind that one or two of the other girls had made of me the same enquiry over the past twelve months . I could not quite remember their identities , but were those currently in statu pupillare to be assembled in a décontractée atmosphere — rather like , say , a police line - up — I felt sure that the whole matter could be discussed as an appendix to their weekly class ‘ Britain in the 1980s’ .

"Its origins were as a ‘ nannying’ organisation formed rapidly to ensure that UK companies were aware of the opportunities presented by North Sea developments . It also had to tackle the challenge of ensuring international oil operators knew of the capabilities of local suppliers . In the early days of North Sea exploration , it was not unknown for project teams to phone Houston , Texas , for a box of bolts which could have been bought off the shelf at an ironmongers in Aberdeen . Mr d'Ancona recalls : ‘ OSO started with the simple remit of cutting the umbilical cord which linked US oil companies with their established suppliers in the Gulf of Mexico , who were for the most part American.’ In fact , multinational oil companies working in the North Sea had little choice but to be receptive to the attempts to maximise the spin - off for UK industry if they wanted to stay in good standing with the Government when applications were being considered for exploration licences .",0

"As the Roman polymath Pietro della Valle observed in 1640 madrigals were now not often sung , ' nor is there occasion to sing them , since people prefer to hear singing freely by heart with instruments in the hand rather than to watch four or five companions singing with book in hand at a table like schoolboys ( che ha troppo del scolaresco e dello studio ) ' . However as late as 1668 another Roman , Mario Savioni ( c. 1608–1685 ) brought out a book of five - part Madrigali morali e spirituali , explaining that they were to be sung each at the end of one of his previously published Concerti morali and adding that he had ' taken care to unite together the aria and the madrigal so as to conform with the character of the concertos ' . The movement of the tide is well illustrated by the successive books of Monteverdi 's madrigals . The first four are normal , though the Fourth Book contains pieces , e.g. ' Sfogava con le stelle ' , with a lot of chordal recitation .

The story was also fuelled by a book , My Turn to Speak , written by Abdolhassan Bani - Sadr , who had been President of Iran in 1980 - 81 . The State Department 's initial refusal to issue Bani - Sadr with a visa to visit the USA to promote his book , followed by its sudden reversal of this stance , had the effect of increasing press interest in the former Iranian President .

"Some examples of the use to which the SERRL database has been put are : the examination of the accessibility of small and medium - sized towns to the motorway and trunk road network in promoting population growth , the analysis of the hinterlands of each of the 900 stations on British Railways ' South Eastern Region , and updating the urban / rural boundary lines using remotely - sensed data . The population growth study took into account both accessibility and the impact of planning policies , including constraints such as green belts . The GIS gave rapid and easy access to the data in a number of different ways , it provided analytical tools for the production of statistical tables , and it allowed the output of maps and specific factors , such as the overlay of the road network onto the green belt layer , showing areas of high and low accessibility , thus permitting the evaluation of population growth potential relative to accessibility and planning constraints . The second study used the transport layer of the database to identify the locations of 900 stations on the British Railways network . Circles of radius one , two , five and ten kilometres were drawn around each station and the census enumeration district data were used to produce maps and tables showing population numbers , structure and characteristics around each of the stations ' catchment areas .",1

I did n't think that strach had a good game — both he and Macca had poor games mainly because White and Hodge could n't win the ball back in midfield . Strach and Macca work well when we have a ball winner in the side ( i.e Fairclough or Batts ) but they had to hang back quite alot to cover Hodge and White who were playing crap . Yep we need Wallace and Speedy back quickly ! ! ! Batts may have been set up or mis quoted something which I 'm sure the press would never intentionally do especially against a team like us who they all love .,1

"Only with every identifiable cancer cell standing would I begin . Feeling one day the need for something more aggressive than the healing ball , I again turned back to my military roots . Tanks and guns bombarding one 's inside seemed totally out of place , so I sought inspiration in earlier times , in the knowledge that what was once just as hideous has , over the years been softened by children 's books , Morte d'Arthur and the legends of chivalry . Pikemen attacking cancer cells seemed altogether too slow and cumbersome .

"With his most famous work , the miner 's safety - lamp , it seemed that science was saving lives as well as boosting the economy . At just the same time George Stephenson also invented a safety - lamp very like Davy 's ; but he did not know the principle on which Davy had designed his , and his lamp was the fruit of practice , of trial and error , guided by the general idea of restricting the supply of gas - laden air . Such a device could not be trusted , and it was the hope of scientists that in place of rules of thumb properly scientific methods could be widely taught . That way the industrial decline of Britain , deplored through most of the century by Presidents of the British Association and eminent men of science generally , would be halted . The Royal Institution had begun with an abortive attempt to train artisans in elementary science ; mechanics ' institutes provided lectures for what seems to have been chiefly a membership from the lower middle class .",0

We were there to witness William getting to grips with his brand - new Jet Ski ; this process seemed to consist largely of getting on , powering away , trying to turn too fast and falling off in an extravagant splash . His big blond head kept coming up , shaking once and then bobbing through the water as he struck out for the machine . There were another three Jet Skis buzzing around on that part of the river and a few water - skiers with their big - engined speedboats , all creating a fair old racket , but we could still hear William laughing ; the guy thought buying a frighteningly expensive piece of machinery and spending most of your time falling off it into the water was just the most enormous wheeze .",0

"1975 statistics from Lesotho reveal the following figures : Schools in Cameroon and in rural areas in Sierra Leone and Ethiopia are unlikely to fare better , while there is no country in Africa without substantial numbers of schools where physical conditions inhibit any but the most basic instruction . At the other end of the scale there are those schools , and they are numerous , where children enjoy the benefit of an adequate weatherproof classroom , something to sit and something to write on . In certain areas — Botswana , Lagos State and Ashanti come to mind — such conditions will be available for most children . Elsewhere one may expect to find a variety , from the very adequate to the very bleak . There is a similar wide variety in the scale of teaching and learning equipment provided , which can be explained by a number of factors : the financial provision made to schools by central or local authorities , the type and efficiency of supply and distribution mechanism ( bureaucratic centralised distribution systems seem universally inefficient ) , differences in attitudes and capabilities of communities to help in the provision of services or equipment to schools or individual children , the initiative and morale of teachers , the richness or poverty of the school environment .",0

The speed of reaching agreement and the lack of conflict in the standing committee indicates the lack of material dispute among the parties — all accepted Swapo 's draft as a working document — and some fine footwork by Swapo behind closed doors . The main areas of dispute had been an executive president , a second house of parliament , and proportional representation . Swapo 's wish for an executive president was opposed by all except the Namibian National Front , which holds one seat .",0
"Max appeared disappointed by the reply as he peered down again at the grisly work on which he was engaged . The contrast between the two men would have struck any observer that morning .

We eventually managed to fly out of the city under a thick cloud of smoke through which the sun was unable to penetrate , and which was present from Sarawak to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore . The most frightening part of the entire experience was that although people we spoke to in East and West Malaysia and Singapore were concerned about and disgusted by the conditions caused by the fire , locals in Kalimantan complacently accepted the smoke problems as a regular annual occurrence . Forest fires are also known to be raging in Sumatra , western Java and southern Sulawesi .",1

This , remember , is W. H. Auden , whom for many years some people in England have regarded as himself too anxious not to bore , too anxious always to amuse .

"Johnson 's book was written in response to the Moors Murders and the ensuing trial . Although Johnson does not go so far as to claim that the affectless society was responsible for the Moors Murders , she does feel able to argue that the general atmosphere in society at the time had ' infected ' the social system , and that ' Brady possibly , Hindley almost certainly , have been victims of fallout ' . Beginning with the publication of Lady Chatterley 's Lover , she argues , the floodgates to total permissiveness were opened and a society in which ' the permissive intellectual 's anything goes ' was created . A series of murders of young children were , she implies , the corollary of the disintegration of moral rules characteristic of 1960s Britain : It seemed to us that April that we were seeing one of the results of total permissiveness in a rather comely young man and woman , ill - educated , but neither of them stupid , on trial at Chester Assizes for multiple murder .",0

"For the lay congregation , scriptural accounts are regarded as literal history , a self - contained story no less true for being divorced from an historical context . Never having been taught otherwise by his spiritual mentors , many a devout believer has had no need to question the problems posed by such a context . When these problems are suddenly posed by a book such as ours , they will quite understandably assume the form of revelation , or of sacrilege . And we ourselves will instinctively be perceived as ' anti - Christian ' , as writers engaged in a fully fledged crusade which pits us , as militant adversaries , against the ecclesiastical establishment — as if we were personally bent on toppling the edifice of Christendom ( and so naive as to think such a feat possible ) .

"Control of Parliament by the executive has never been more complete than in the twentieth century , with compliant MPs loyally following party policy . The nature of the disciplinary sanctions on which the system rests is that the modern MP is heavily reliant on the support of party activists and party finance in order to be elected . It is not so much the whips as the local constituency activists who indirectly but effectively apply sanctions ( such as not readopting him or her ) to keep the overwhelming majority of MPs toeing the party line , and government control very tight . Then , there is the simple point that MPs would prefer their party in power , no matter what it does , rather than in opposition . We should also note that a contemporary British government relies , like its eighteenth - century predecessors , on patronage .",0
"But notices warning of reindeer and even of moose ( elk ) crossing - places kept us in reality , and soon the country began to open out , forests giving way to scrubby birch and willows with rolling hills and quiet lakes in the valleys . We spotted our first reindeer lying down in a hollow by the roadside some distance ahead and , as I had a telephoto lens on the camera , the others encouraged me to have a go at stalking it . So I wormed my way along the roadside ditch , getting torn and scratched by thorns in the process , until I judged I was opposite to where the animal lay , peaceably chewing the cud .

"( These ideas of Gramsci 's have been notably developed and applied to recent criminal justice policy by Stuart Hall , whose account of ' law and order ideology ' we discussed in Chapter 1 . ) There is much more to Gramsci than this : for example , Marxist theory is indebted to his pioneering use of concepts such as ' praxis ' , ' civil society ' , ' class fractions ' and the ' historical bloc'and his analysis of the nature , role and composition of the state in class societies . Perhaps above all , Gramsci injected a sense of humanism into Marxism : for him , history was made by human beings . He believed that socialism would not come about as the inevitable result of impersonal laws of economic development but would have to be built by active human beings working purposively and creatively . However , it is in his treatment of ideology that Gramsci 's legacy has been most pervasive and where he is the unmistakable precursor of all the Marxist and post - Marxist theorists we now proceed to discuss .",0
"Its main function will be to ascertain whether the results of the first investigation would appear as firm to another team going over the same ground . Once re - investigation becomes routine , the fact that a case has been referred for re - investigation should attract no more concern than the fact that a medical diagnosis has been subjected to the test of a second opinion .

"Since their widespread introduction in the 1960s , drift - nets have already laid waste enormous areas of open ocean , especially in the North Atlantic and North Pacific . Drift - netting is becoming recognised as the most indiscriminate method of fishing ever devised . As most drift - netting operations are carried out in international waters where little or no international agreements are in force , it is extremely difficult to control this destruction of life on the high seas , or even to get an accurate picture of its magnitude . Japan , Taiwan and South Korea are the three countries most responsible for drift - netting , and are operating mainly in the North Pacific . Other nations that use drift - nets include the US , Italy , and Spain , while Denmark in the 1970s had a large drift - net fishery for salmon in the North Atlantic .",0
"There are no easy answers here . Even the prescription of a joint approach to issues of sexism and racism ( Brah and Deem , 1986 ) does little more than scratch the surface of a very much deeper problem . Educational and pedagogic strategies developed by feminists more conscious of the need to dig deeper into psychic processes in tackling sexual identities and subjectivities ( e.g. Walker dine , 1991 ) require more serious attention within antiracism , and have found a sympathetic counterpart in Phil lip Cohen 's cultural studies approach to antiracism ( Cohen , 1987 , 1988 , 1989a ) . In antiracism as much as in multiculturalism , the absence of any serious engagement with issues around sexuality in the ' irrationality ' of popular racism is symptomatic of a rationalist understanding of pedagogies and educational processes . In the case of antiracism , this is further underpinned by an overly rationalist conception of state and dominant class racism .",0

"Fabia exclaimed as , more strolling than anything , they ambled along hilltop pathways through an avenue of silver birch trees . ‘ I thought you might like it,’ he commented , and Fabia had to give her special attention to catkins , and to where lilac was about to break out of bud , because as her heart began to race she could n't help but think that Ven had intended to bring her with him to Petřín , even as he 'd casually tossed that invitation at her . Suddenly then though her attention was taken by a red squirrel which darted from nowhere and , effortlessly it seemed , bounced over the grass and then , as if jerked up on a string , shot up a tree . ‘ Oh , look!’ she whispered in an awed kind of voice , and flicked a glance from the squirrel to Ven , to find that he was looking — at her ! ‘ Nature - lover,’ he teased , and she knew then that she held him in some quite high regard .",1

"The task at this stage will be to ascertain the feelings and problems which exist on an individual level , and to discuss them . This may involve dealing with depression , disappointment and many other feelings that have arisen since retirement . It may be necessary to get the individual to look at alternative ways of approaching and coping with the circumstances of life without work , perhaps trying to ‘ wipe the slate clean’ and start the process all over again , but with an increased awareness of the problems and difficulties that are involved .

"It is rare nowadays to find a research council able to live within its means and reasonably happy with its situation , but that is the impression that the Natural Environment Research Council ( NERC ) put over when it launched its annual report . Indeed , NERC 's chairman , Professor John Knill , described 1990–91 as ' a very good year ' . He puts the success down to the science strategies that NERC adopted in the 1987–89 period , while the new resources gained in 1988 and 1989 are ' now bearing scientific fruit ' . Knill claims that NERC now involves the whole of the environmental science community . He stresses the interdisciplinary nature of the research and the elimination of the gap between higher education institutions ( HEIs ) and NERC 's institutes .",0
"Drinks sweetened with aspartame deteriorate rapidly in hot weather . ‘ Currently , Coke and Pepsi do n't sell diet drinks in the Middle East because of the heat,’ Shaw says . ‘ In areas of the US such as Arizona they spend a lot of money making sure the product is moved off the shelf within three to five days or brought back.’ Tate & Lyle will also clash heads with Nutrasweet in the fat substitute sector .

"Rules of thumb are the only rules there are , in the atelier . But experience has taught me that this is the rule of thumb that can be most profitably proposed and acted upon . I dare to go further : some of the most gifted and earnest among my contemporaries — I think of Edgar Dowers in the United States and Geoffrey Hill in the United Kingdom ( though I except Hill 's wonderful Mercian Hymns ) — fall short of pleasing me as they might , because they seem not to have followed this rule of thumb , and their language is habitually for my taste a shade , or several shades , too grandiloquent or ‘ literary’ . I conclude that Ford 's ‘ critical act’ was indeed ( by and large , always by and large ) the most important of the first half of this century , and that it is , moreover , irreversible .

"The influence of the bishops , and of the church generally , on the content of the Ordinances was negligible . The prelates were concerned , as explicit statements show , primarily to defend the church 's liberties . The church figured in this document only in the same general terms as it figured in Magna Carta ; there was one reference to prohibitions , but begging still the question of what were temporalities and what were not . This in itself bears witness to the limits of clerical influence . Although Winchelsey was a leading figure in political opposition to the crown in 1297 and in 1310–11 , his influence on the two occasions differed , for whereas in 1297 both clergy and laity shared a common grievance over taxation , this was not so in 1310–11 .",0

"The target figure is usually a character whose comeuppance , in terms of simple poetic justice , is most likely to be reassuring : types such as the avaricious or preoccupied merchant , the boorish peasant , the selfish priest , in the roles of jealous husband or cohabitor , or selfish would - be seducer . We may note that in its targeting of a number of these figures , the fabliaux present a morality that does not offer a blanket indulgence to sexual desires ; in some respects fabliau morality is very conventional . With the illicit amorous adventures of wives in the situation of the eternal triangle ( husband , wife , lover ) being the most common single dramatic type in the fabliaux , the most frequent type as the object of ridicule is the deceived husband , often not merely cuckolded but on occasion beaten or otherwise degraded or abused as well ; and what is more after all this sometimes so utterly deceived that he remains happy in the delusion that his wife has proved herself faithful to him . An elegant example of this is La Bourgoise d'Orliens , "" The townswoman of Orléans "" , in which the husband , a merchant , suspecting his wife of having a clerk as a lover ( which she has ) tests her by pretending to go away but returning in the guise of a clerk . She sees through the ruse and has the supposed clerk locked away , then beaten by her servants and dumped on a dungheap .",0

"At root , the educational changes with which we are engaged are fuelled by rapidly changing socio - economic patterns , and the particular political drive given to these at the moment is of much less importance ( in anything other than the short term ) than we may often feel to be the case . The present political initiative rests upon a consumer- or market - based perspective as the driving force for change , and upon the belief that managers within the service will respond to that direction . However , this begs many questions about the ways in which they will respond and some of these issues will be identified later . It is not possible to establish , even in the broadest terms , educational needs for the present , or the immediate future , without taking into account the fundamental economic and social changes which are summed up in the phrase , ' a post - industrial society ' . While some regard these changes with optimism and others with foreboding , there is a growing consensus that they are changes of a very different magnitude and nature to anything since the Industrial Revolution — and even that comparison may underestimate the process as far as time - scale is concerned .",0

"When , in his thirties , he took driving lessons and passed his test Dorothy refused to go out in the car with him : ‘ I intend to live to a ripe old age , thank you very much.’ In fact , Edward was a good driver , if somewhat decorous .

"Yes we had a meeting a few weeks ago to discuss the future and it was agreed that we should have three issues a year rather than four , I think this would be welcomed by local police stations got ta change the dates to act on market research which indicates certain months when certain security devices sell well . We 've talked to the existing publishers and this was now eight weeks ago and they still have n't written despite many phone calls from me to put suggestions forward as to costings and so on . We 've also approached Nottingham Evening Post who 've expressed an interest in taking it on , but again we still have n't got a meeting , so I intend ringing them both this week , and stressing that we need to get a move on because really we need an issue out by March . We did discuss themes for each issue , but this will be security themes , and it would help the people who are producing the paper to sell because this is one big moan they 've had , they do n't know what the content is until the last moment if they knew it was say er car security they could approach garages and car security device manufacturers etc . So that 's the way forward we hope to retain a sixteen page issue three times a year , a bit more thinking behind it and er hopefully produced at erm no extra cost to us , that 's why we 've gone to another supplier .",0
"I now understand that there will be no review of the future of the Scottish regiments unless there is a dramatic change in circumstances or a change in the strategic requirements of the country . How does he reconcile that with the rather desperate hints given by the Secretary of State in recent weeks as he vainly tried to rally his troops in the recent by - election ? Is it not the case that after all the hype and hopes that were insinuated in the debate , the Scottish Office is toeing the Ministry of Defence line ?

"After all , she even resented him spending his . He theorized that she went into a shop and lashed out a bob or two on something like a tin of baked beans .

"Polling Day Weather : Dry , sunny and warm THE RESULT of the general election was thrown wide open last night , with three polls suggesting a last - minute rallying of support for the embattled Conservatives . As the political leaders completed their campaigns , three out of four eve - of - poll surveys put Labour and the Tories neck and neck , pointing to the closest result for nearly 20 years . Gallup for The Daily Telegraph gave the Conservatives a hair 's breadth half - point lead over Labour , with the Liberal Democrats in danger of being squeezed as the two main parties battle to emerge as the largest party in a possible hung parliament . According to Gallup , the Tories are on 38½ per cent , Labour 38 and the Liberal Democrats 20 . In the same poll last week , the Tories also had a half - point lead .",0
"So ( it is argued ) , a party comes to power claiming a mandate to implement its manifesto of seaside promises , and in the process established policies are mindlessly repealed in the struggle to deliver election commitments and please the party faithful . However , as the reality of the economic situation presses in on the government so it is inevitable that more sensible and pragmatic policies are adopted 2 or 3 years into office . Unfortunately , just as these newer policies begin to bear fruit , the country is hurled into the turmoil of another general election and the cycle of misguided mandate and policy change starts all over again . These bouts of manifesto madness , U - turns , and broken promises , not only frustrate business confidence but also lead to public disillusion so that authority dribbles out of government and the legitimacy of the overall system is called into question . In other words , the adversary system is said to have both economic costs and political costs .",0

"Elizabeth , having given birth to 13 children and aged only 46 , was buried at Catherine Hill on 19 June . Like all his brothers , Charles was destined to outlive his wife ; and in a sense we may not wonder at that fact . We have seen what a struggle it must have been for men in the late 18th century to keep body and soul together — how much worse , then , for their womenfolk . Things had improved slightly for married women since the patriarchal days of the feudal system , and few people in the late 1700s could have shared Luther 's view that : If a woman becomes weary , or at last dead , from child - bearing , it matters not ; let her only die from bearing , she is there to do it .",0

"His parliamentary interventions were not confined to property , housing and environmental questions . He shuddered , for instance , at the prospect of school textbooks containing anything of a ' salacious , blasphemous or subliminal political nature ' . His vestigial liberalism or compassion persuaded him to resist the introduction of the poll tax for nurses and other deserving persons — but the Whips knew him as a man who would always toe the lobby line with a specious ministerial assurance , such as Nicolas Ridley 's promised poll tax rebate of £ 130 millions .

"The precautionary principle is the better known of the two , and increasingly figures in environmental and health legislation . It is normally understood as the Hippocratic Oath applied to the global ecology : above all , do no harm . By contrast , the proactionary principle is associated with self - styled futurists , for whom being “ human ” is defined by our capacity to keep ahead of the game when taking calculated risks , whether by benefiting from success or learning from failure . The difference between the two principles is most clearly apparent in their implications for the relationship between science and technology . Precautionary policymakers invoke scientific uncertainty to curb technological innovation , whereas their proactionary counterparts encourage innovation as an extension of scientific hypothesis testing .",0

"Building work at the School included the new Sykes classroom and the re - laying of the floor in the large hall ; outside , when a double tram track was laid in Greek Street in 1905 , the Governors paid £ 100 to have 60 yards of wooden blocks ( instead of stone setts ) put down , to lessen the noise from the street . Ironically , in view of what had happened fifty years earlier , it was now the School 's success which precipitated the next crisis . By 1910 ) there were 155 pupils on the roll ; although this was only five more than that for which the original buildings had been designed , and there was now also the extra Sykes classroom , the Board of Education indicated that there was serious overcrowding and something would have to be done : the School fell considerably short of modern standards , and unless the Governors could provide suitable accommodation , the grant would not be paid after July 1915 . There was no room to expand satisfactorily at Greek Street , especially because of the loss of land sold to the Technical School for its building and subsequent expansion . The only solution was to move .",1

"The earth is trying to move on a straight line through space - time , but the curvature of space - time produced by the mass of the sun causes it to go in a circle around the sun . Similarly , light tries to travel in a straight line , but the curvature of space - time near the sun causes the light from distant stars to be bent if it passes near the sun . Normally , one is not able to see stars in the sky that are in almost the same direction as the sun . During an eclipse , however , when most of the sun 's light is blocked off by the moon , one can observe the light from those stars . Einstein produced his general theory of relativity during the First World War , when conditions were not suitable for scientific observations , but immediately after the war a British expedition observed the eclipse of 1919 and confirmed the predictions of general relativity : Space - time is not flat , but is curved by the matter and energy in it .",0

"People with a low tolerance for change therefore tend to fight hard to maintain the status quo , often without being able to articulate their reasons for so doing . There are other reasons for resistance to change . People sometimes resist change to save face when , for example , they think that supporting change would amount to an admission that some of their previous decisions or beliefs were wrong . People might also resist change because of peer group pressure to do so even though , off the record , they may acknowledge the changes as beneficial . Strategies for overcoming resistance to change in other people have to be appropriate to the type of resistance encountered .",0
"The anthropologists have to point again and again to the great many societies in which spouses are arranged and not freely chosen . A biologist who was so minded could counter by arguing that , if by and large the marriages generate the children , then marriage laws could still have been influenced by evolutionary pressures . While that argument would beg an important question , on the face of it the marriage laws do seem to promote the function of optimal outbreeding . Marriage with close kin is generally forbidden in most societies and so , commonly , is marriage with people of dissimilar culture . A general bias in favour of spouses who come from nearby — both spatially and socially — has often been noted by anthropologists ( Fortes , 1962 ) .",0

"In a famous paper on logic and conversation , the philosopher H. P. Grice proposed that conversationalists acknowledge the existence of a ' cooperative principle ' which requires them to give as much information as is needed , to be truthful , relevant and not vague or ambiguous . People do not always observe the principle , of course , but where a speaker flouts it , the hearer will suspect she has a reason . For instance , someone who expresses her opinion of a friend 's appearance very vaguely may be suspected of doing so in order to be polite ( saving others ' face is a common motive for vagueness , untruthfulness and withholding information ) . Someone who tells me an apparently irrelevant fact may well want me to deduce a hidden inference in it , a proposition they prefer not to make explicit . In Grice 's theory , logic in conversation is not just a matter of explicit surface connections between utterances .",0

"There was , of course , talk of union all round ; it was in the early 1890s , as we have noted , that the historic divisions between General and Particular Baptists were finally consolidated into the Baptist Union . In the year in which Joseph Parker made his controversial speech the Baptists and Congregationalists held some of their ‘ May Meetings’ jointly but talk of the two denominations uniting found little support . With Methodists , however , the talk of reunion bore fruit not only at home but abroad where English divisions had been taken by emigrants . In Canada a united Methodist Church was created in the 1880s and in Australia in 1902 . In America the divisions over slavery in the 1840s and 1850s continued with separate Northern and Southern churches .",0
"A similar confirmation is required in any announcement of a mandatory offer ( Rule 2.5(c ) ) . Although such a confirmation does not have to be given in relation to a voluntary offer until the offer document is posted , it is imperative that the necessary investigation work be completed by the financial adviser before the announcement is made , given that the announcement binds the offeror to post the offer document . A number of further points should be noted:(1 ) If the financial adviser is acting for a newly - formed bidder ( eg an "" off - the - shelf "" company ) , the standard of care required of it has a special dimension . An offer should only be announced once an irrevocable commitment to provide the necessary funds has been received from a person upon whom reliance can reasonably be placed at that time ( see Panel Notice 1991/4 of 1 May 1991 in relation to Luirc Corp and Merlin International Properties Ltd ) . ( 2 ) Except with the consent of the Panel , the offer document must describe how the offer is to be financed , the source of that finance , the names of the principal lenders or arrangers of the finance and , if the financing or any security for it will depend to any significant extent on the business of the target , the arrangements concerned ( or a negative statement)(Rule 24.2(d ) —see para 11.3.5.7 below ) .",0
"He had a ‘ gut feeling’ , he said , that the American people were not yet committed to war , and so he urged Mr Bush to pursue a meeting in Baghdad between James Baker , the secretary of state , and Saddam Hussein — as well as finding a date on which Iraq 's foreign minister could come to Washington . Perhaps in response to this call for negotiations ( though that is something that the administration would not admit ) , Mr Baker is set to make another tour of allied capitals in Europe and the Middle East , during which he would , at the very least , be available for a meeting in Baghdad . All this begs the question about the reliability of Mr Dole 's gut . In two careful analyses of the survey evidence over the past four months , the Washington Post and the American Political Report , an influential newsletter , have come to broadly similar conclusions . Though the initial approval ratings for Mr Bush 's handling of the Gulf ( which were above 75 % ) have not been sustained , he has consistently maintained the support of about 60 % of Americans for his general policy .",0

"He observes the prohibition against ‘ talking shop’ , whereas Pound through his London years seems never to have talked anything else . ( Once again Eliot knew , or soon learned , better . ) And the most Anglophobe of Pound 's books is , appropriately , the one that is most full of shoptalk — though of shoptalk of a special kind , the talk of the master to his apprentices in the shop that is a workshop , the atelier where the talk that goes on is the vehicle by which an artistic tradition is transmitted , not in conceptualizing , and tendentious readings of history , but where it is concrete , in tricks of the trade and rules of thumb and words to the wise . I have in mind How To Read , a disastrously misnamed little treatise , since its real subject is How to Write , and it is addressed to what Pound called ( with the engagingly dated Edwardian elegance that he never wholly shed)‘the neophyte’— that is to say , to the young American writer who wants to know as soon as possible , though at the expense of considerable exertion which he is prepared for , how to assemble his kit of tools for the job in hand and others that he can dimly foresee . When Pound revised and expanded this to make The ABC of Reading ( the title is still a misnomer ) , he winkled out of it most of the anti - Englishness that had been present in the first version , when Pound was still smarting from what he took to be England 's rejection of him eight years before , in 1920 .",0

What Every Woman Wants by Edwina Currie stood cheek by jowl with a thriller by Douglas Hurd .

"Incidentally , it would be good to remember that Article nineteen does not say that ‘ The church is a congregation with Anglican style’ but merely this : The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men , in the which the pure Word of God is preached , and the Sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ 's ordinance … This is a very helpful rule of thumb ! Moreover , Article thirty - four insists : It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one , and utterly like ; for at all times they have been divers , and may be changed according to the diversities of countries , times , and men 's manners , so that nothing be ordained against God 's Word .",0

"Lenders were exempt from this legislation if their basic business was banking , insurance , or primarily unconnected with lending ; friendly societies and building societies were subject to other laws ; various other lenders falling outside a commonsense view of what constituted a moneylender were given exemption by the Board of Trade . Lenders in general could recover unpaid debts through enforcement of a county court judgment allowing seizure and sale of goods ; debtors who defied a court order to pay could be imprisoned . So , early this century , the regulatory position might be briefly summarised as protecting the minority of people driven into debt to make ends meet ; on the assumption that they faced not only hardship in itself but also particular risk of exploitation by unscrupulous lenders . Credit taken by the general run of consumers — those not in an extremity of financial need — was not specially regulated . Banks , besides their main concern with commercial and industrial lending , made some overdraft loans at relatively low rates of interest to ( relatively affluent and thus secure ) private customers .",0

"In this second document , then , the Secretary of State showed himself aware of some of the differing demands : breadth with no sacrifice of depth ; practical content that will not displace the theoretical ; the maintenance , even the raising , of ' standards ' , with a welcome none the less for those who might have approached learning and assessment in a new way . The extent to which pupils at school progressing from the GCSE to A levels will find an unbridgeable gap will depend on the way in which ' differentiating ' the curriculum and the assessment of pupils is interpreted in different schools , and for different courses . If , as seems probable , most teachers will sort out their pupils into the high and the low fliers at a fairly early stage , and if there is a whole separate set of papers in some subjects for the high and the low , then the difference between the higher grades of GCSE and O levels will not turn out to be very great . Despite all the detailed criteria set out for assessment , despite the emphasis on course - work , in the end ' high ' GCSE will be familiar enough , and the transition to A level not a matter of genuine difficulty . As now , the decision who will proceed to A level , and thence to higher education will in effect have been taken at the end of the third year .",1
"FROM memories of a journey through Alresford in the 1920s to a paper on Rasputin , the stories told by members at Alresford Historical and Literary Society 's annual manuscript evening held the large audience 's attention with their detail and variety . Reg Sanders ' ‘ Things not generally known’ opened the evening with a mish - mash of information gleaned through some 300 historical reference books . For instance , he said that the expression ‘ by hook or by crook’ came from the period of Charles II when there were two judges called Hook and Crook and ‘ a man of straw’he discovered , was one who could be brought to bear false witness — recognisable by the straw in his shoes . Ursula Oxley read from the memoirs of Henry Hunt who was born Wiltshire , was elected to parliament , and worked for the repeal of the corn laws . On February 15th , 1835 , en route to the west country he stopped at Alresford , was seized by paralysis and died .",0

"Her trunk had been placed at the foot of her bed , whose curtains , in harmony with those at the window , were of heavy glazed chintz patterned with flowers .

"In the New Testament , Matthew ( 25 : 14–30 ) relates the parable about the man who entrusted his property to three servants . Two of the servants doubled the funds entrusted to them and were praised for their efforts . The third servant simply buried the funds entrusted to him in a hole in the ground for safekeeping and was condemned for his worthlessness because he had not even taken the ( virtually riskless ) alternative of leaving the money on deposit with the bankers . Even earlier , Aristotle wrote in The Politics : ' To protect the treasury from being defrauded , let all public money be issued openly in front of the whole city , and let copies of the accounts be deposited in the various wards'(Sinclair , 1984 ) . Both of these references relate to one particular concept of accountability , namely that of ' financial accountability ' .",1

"As Bismarck said , ' I have always found the word ' Europe ' on the lips of those who wanted something from other powers which they dared not demand in their own name ' .

If , as seems likely , she consolidates this position via the single market , while gaining de facto control of the single currency , one could well envisage a scenario in which a strong Germany was bad for Europe .",0

"But a government that grows too large , centralized , bureaucratic , and expensive substantially impairs the private economy by eroding individual initiative and responsibility ; crowding out private investment , consumption , and charity ; and damaging incentives with high tax rates . It also risks crowding out necessary government functions such as defense . That is today ’s Europe in a nutshell , with America not far behind . The recent death of James ~ M .~ Buchanan , the father of public - choice economics , is reason to reflect on his sage warnings . Buchanan was awarded the Nobel ~ Prize in 1986 for bringing to the study of government and the behavior of government officials the same rigorous analysis that economists had long applied to private economic decision - making .",0

"Having quoted the opening of Gormenghast in 1.4 as an example of an opaque style , we shall now return to another passage which occurs shortly after it in the same novel . In the foregrounding model , stylistic value has a slightly different meaning from that which it has in the "" stylistic variants "" model : it refers to the special act of interpretation which we make in order to make sense of what would otherwise appear strange and unmotivated . Each qualitative foregrounding implicitly begs a question : what should have led the author to express himself in this exceptional way ? For this purpose , the exceptional includes not only the sense deviations we earlier called tropes ( 3.1C ) , but also the patterns or exceptional regularities of structure that we earlier called schemes . Like stylistic variants , foregrounded features can be observed on different levels of the code : tropes , such as metaphor , being chiefly associated with category violations ( on the levels of syntax and semantics ) , and schemes being chiefly associated with structural patterns ( on the levels of syntax and phonology ) .",0
"While they were working their way into the hinterland , various peoples of the eastern Caucasus adopted a militant version of Islam and found a leader in the legendary Shamil . By 1843 Dagestan , to the north - east of Georgia , was in uproar . Fifteen years of insisting on integration had borne little fruit . The tsar 's attempts to dictate policy from St Petersburg had culminated , in 1842 , in the creation of the Sixth Department of the Imperial Chancery , the only subdivision of that body to be charged with responsibility for a discrete geographical area . Nicholas had begun to grasp , however , that even the most determined central intervention in Caucasian affairs was unlikely to further the cause of imperial unity .",0
"T. B. Panabokke , when Police Magistrate at Matale , was also suspicious : ‘ The usual evidence was that so - and - so lost his animal and that two or three people at different places , when they went to turn water to their fields , met the accused driving the animals away . The witness speaks to the accused , whereby the witness has an opportunity of recognizing the thieves and the animal with its brandmarks.’ E. M. Byrde , the Police Magistrate at Anuradhapura in 1896 , noted that ‘ cattle stealers do not go about , as witnesses would wish one to believe , removing stolen cattle in broad daylight or along frequented high roads by moonlight.’ The testimony of a witness in a case tried at Matara early in the nineteenth century illustrates the lack of plausibility of much court testimony : ‘ I saw the two prisoners drive a head of cattle — It was in the high road — It was about two hours before dark — We asked them where are you going with the animal — Is this not the animal of the schoolmaster . The prosecution case quickly broke down under cross - examination .",0

Turf and peat could be cut and dried for fuel and building materials , rough wood was used for firewood and construction , and reeds , rushes and bracken were gathered for bedding , roofing , flooring and building .

"Unfortunately the application of the anti - inflation policies which were associated with this particular interpretation of the NAIRU hypothesis was to expose many unforeseen drawbacks . From the 1970s onwards governments restricted aggregate demand by a variety of means . Although politicians tended to steer clear of acknowledging this aspect of policy too publicly , in their more candid moments they admitted that this cure for inflation went hand in glove with a rise in unemployment above NAIRU . For as long as U remains above NAIRU , inflation should be falling . The catch phrase ‘ If it is n't hurting , it is n't working’ came to epitomize this approach to anti - inflation policy .",0
"She is the successor of the great russian musician Samuel Feinberg , the first Soviet pianist to perform all of the Well - Tempered Clavier in concert , and Nikolayeva 's conception of work is pure , simple , lucid yet varied , romantic and at times highly individual . This is a Well - Tempered Clavier of universal appeal that seems to paradoxically embrace the romantic Russian school of Feinberg and Goldenweiser,(Nikolayeva 's teacher ) , as well as the demands of our own age for authenticity and clarity . At all times one is aware that the artist is also a composer — the conviction with which she untangles some of the more complicated , almost obscure pieces , has an unquestionable authority ( the enormous B flat minor Fugue from Book Two instantly comes to mind in this connection ) , whilst the famous pieces are often presented in a totally different manner — the A minor Prelude and Fugue ( Book One ) will surprise many as the Prelude is fearful and serious ( rather than light with the usual staccato touches ) , whilst the Fugue has clipped articulation at the end of each subject entry . The result is that the piece seems to become more polyphonic as the listener can more easily hear the lines . Nikolayeva adopts an orchestral approach in some pieces,(eg . the C sharp minor Fugue [ Book Two ] , where the intensity and unyielding rhythm make a strong impression ) , but her tonal range also suggests the organ ( E flat minor Prelude , Book One ) , a choir ( B flat minor Prelude , Book One ) , a trumpet ( D major Prelude , Book Two ) , and a violin ( B flat minor Prelude , Book One ) .",0

"QPR are not good enough to finish in the top six , according to Trevor Francis , their player - manager , but they should have won and would surely have done so but for a mind - boggling miss by Andy Sinton when it was 2 - 2 . For the second week in succession , Spurs ' dodgy defence had thrown away a 2 - 0 lead . Lineker spared their blushes this time , but not even the striker acclaimed by Francis as Europe 's best ( Gullit may sue ) can oblige every week if the requirement is two goals for a draw , three for a win . ‘ Of course , some things are still not right,’ Terry Venables , approaching the second anniversary of his appointment , said . Two new players were needed to take Spurs where they wanted to go .",0
"The policy implication of this view is a programme to help those farmers who can help themselves to grow cash crops . A quotation ( provided by Randall Baker , private communication ) from a recent Australian funded cattle ranching scheme in Fiji illustrates both the unquestioned assumption that development must imply modern commercial development and the disparaging attitude towards existing social and economic organisation : The Fijian traditional communal system of livelihood has a tendency to restrict initiative for commercial expansion and development so that there is a need to modify commercial values to meet with the demands of modern commercialism , This , in a nutshell , is what the Yalavou project sets out 10 do .

"Only in very unusual situations do we speak with fixed , unvarying pitch , and when we speak normally the pitch of our voice is constantly changing . One of the most important tasks in analysing intonation is to listen to the speaker 's pitch and recognise what it is doing ; this is not an easy thing to do , and it seems to be a quite different skill from that acquired in studying segmental phonetics . We describe pitch in terms of high and low , and some people find it difficult to relate what they hear in someone 's voice to a scale ranging from low to high . We should remember that ‘ high’ and ‘ low’are arbitrary choices for end - points of the pitch scale . It would be perfectly reasonable to think of pitch as ranging instead from ‘ light’ to ‘ heavy’ , for example , or from ‘ left’to ‘ right’ , and people who have difficulty in ‘ hearing’intonation patterns are generally only having difficulty in relating what they hear ( which is the same as what everyone else hears ) to this ‘ pseudo - spatial’representation .",1

"When things go badly wrong , is it best to abort the mission , cut one 's losses and use the resources more effectively elsewhere , or go on trying ? There is a difference between a project which never gets off the ground and one which suddenly goes bad . The natural tendency is to try harder with the project that has gone some distance . Yet it would be possible to argue exactly the opposite case . The project that never got off the ground may need redesigning .",0
"However , when we become adults we tend to think we 've learnt everything we need to know in this area and stop practising . Then when we have a difficult relationship at home or work it 's easier to blame the other person than look at what we did .

"This was the first year that CPRW had set targets and perhaps we were too optimistic . However some branches have managed to make good progress towards meeting their target .

"But Congress is in deep disrepute in India . The past two years of economic reform have won Mr Rao and his finance minister , Manmohan Singh , much praise from foreigners and from Indian businessmen . And the policy is bearing fruit : India 's economy will probably expand by more than 5 % this year and inflation is down to 7 % . Yet Congress seems to be getting little thanks for this from the voters . Politics - watchers guess that , had Rajiv Gandhi not been assassinated at the end of the general - election campaign two years ago , the BJP would have won roughly as many seats as Congress .",0

"The intrepid manager had to content himself with numbering his reserve teams .

"By the beginning of 1968 Britain was ceasing to be regarded by many Americans as either a powerful or a special ally .

George Brown , minister of the ill - fated Department of Economic Affairs , even believed that with American aid the British economy could quickly be restored to health .

"It is true that when they use words like "" aggression "" and - "" altruism "" ( which they do a great deal ) they make a pretence that they have somehow dissociated these terms from their human behavioural origins — but it is only a pretence . If an observer interprets a piece of animal behaviour as either aggressive or altruistic he is , in effect , saying : "" If that creature were a man I should describe his behaviour as aggressive or altruistic as the case may be . "" As far as the humanity / animality issue is concerned , this begs the question . And indeed the anthropomorphism of the sociobiologists goes much further than that since they regularly employ a language which derives directly from the ideology of twentieth - century capitalism : investment , costs , benefits are central elements in their vocabulary . I do not want to get involved in the technicalities of such arguments but , for good or ill , the anthropomorphic style of sociobiological interpretation , together with its exaggerated insistence that virtually all patterns of animal behaviour ( including those found in man ) can be explained by evolutionary hypotheses , has lately served to reinforce and extend Darwin 's original Epicurean thesis that the difference between man and other animals is simply one of degree , that there is no natural discontinuity .",0
"So far as the civil law was concerned , heirs inherited liability to pay debts in equal shares ; the maxim nomina ipso iure divisa is familiar . Equally , so far as the civil law was concerned , a request phrased in terms of a trust to one of the heirs to pay all debts would be ineffective . So far too as creditors were concerned , the daughter would be fair game until she had obtained a formal release from liability . It is precisely this that she is seeking to obtain in this case . Under the law of trusts , however , a request of this kind was significant , and amounted to creating an entitlement in the daughter to seek relief from liability .",0

"I think it 's , it really begins in the home , this , because mothers can do quite a lot in not educating their own sons to think of them as servants . A lot of women do this , they 're very tolerant about boys ' mess in the home and untidiness generally , and in a sense they , they lay the foundations , right from the very beginning , of boys ' growing up to think of women as kind of household servants . This attitude , you know , boys will be boys and they make a mess and poor Mum has to do all the washing , is really quite , quite misguided because it , it does encourage those assumptions that mothers are there to tidy up after sons , and of course then sons when they grow up and get wives want to replace their mothers . So women themselves can do something about educating men in the home , starting with their sons .

"Microsoft Corp sketched out its plans for tackling the groupware market last week and explained how it is taking a completely different tack from Lotus Development Corp. Instead of producing a specific group application like Lotus Notes , which has become virtually synonymous with the sector , Microsoft is concentrating on ‘ groupware - enabling’ its existing applications . From a technical point of view this is mainly nip and tuck stuff , but Microsoft is betting that the innovative use of existing technology will be a winner and is finally cashing in on all the application programming interfaces , dynamic data exchange , object linking and embedding facilities that it has been burying in its applications and operating systems for the last couple of years . Two ‘ products’ were previewed in a UK briefing which embody this approach . The first such is Microsoft Workgroup Templates : these are bundles of technologies , such as macros and dynamic link libraries which can be bolted onto existing applications to turn them into a specific workgroup ‘ solution’ .",0

"Like the Mirza Nama , the Shah Jehan Nama worships superficial , shiny things — gifts , uniforms , jewels — and deliberately ignores the darkness and corruption which lay at the heart of the court . Where it differs from the Mirza Nama is in the richness of the fawning which curdles every sentence : reading Inayat Khan 's chronicle you experience a sensation like drowning under a sea of the sweetest , stickiest honey . Several years before the thought came to His Majesty 's omniscient mind that he should select some pleasant sight on the banks of the River Jumna … where he might found a splendid and delightful edifice . In accordance with the promptings of his noble nature , he envisioned that streams of water should be made to flow through the proposed fort and that its terraces should overlook the river . For all its oily sycophancy , the Shah Jehan Nama probably gives the authentic flavour of the enterprise : Shah Jehan 's town , like Shah Jehan 's court chronicle , was there to glorify the ruler .",0

"It is often also the retaliation , not the provocation , that receives the punishment and the attention .

Mr Duggan is quite alone in his view that , to use his word , ‘ most’ of Welsh players who did received the harshest punishments meted out by any R.F.U. — if you have any doubts ask Messrs Wheel and Moseley .

"United 's best chance of the half came just a minute later ; Martin Foyle ran on to the perfect Paul Simpson through ball , he actually got past goal keeper Andy Gosney but he was forced just a little bit wide . He ran into the path of fellow striker , Lee Nogan , and as both hesitated who was going to put the ball into the empty net , the chance had gone and the ball was hacked away . Three minutes later Simpson ran on to a back pass , he got his foot to the ball just before Gosney , he collided with the goal keeper , but full marks the goal keeper , he grabbed the ball at the second attempt , and once again , the chance had gone . Portsmouth then had a good spell , they forced two successive corners but the half ended with United so almost scoring . In the forty third minute , Foyle volleyed wide from fifteen yards when really he should have been on target after receiving from Magilton , and as referee Taylor was looking at his whistle to blow it for half time , United skipper , Steve Foster drove forward from the edge of the penalty area , shrugged off a couple of challenges , hit a good low shot , seemingly under the body of Gosney , but Gosney 's body just halted the flow of the ball .",0

It can also confer one of the true joys of existence and it is an aspect of the beautiful and the peak experience . Men go up high mountains to achieve a new perspective ; thus all prophets have done this so they can dissolve the nuts and bolts of difference and see in their place the unity .

"The stale water in the puddles and pools outside is much more attractive .

In reality , the risk is really rather slight , though even this can be eliminated by taking more trouble to rinse off all the detergent from the cat 's dishes . Because cats are many times more sensitive to detergent contamination than we humans are , much more rinsing than usual is required .",0

Almost 25 per cent of all the farms in Wales were reported as having low standards of living ‘ with an element of struggle in making ends meet financially’ . Most of the farmers interviewed in the south - west of England were more than 50 year old , and the very small farms represented 30 per cent of all agricultural holdings in that region . Farm incomes averaged as little as £ 442 per annum , but were regarded as providing ‘ a useful — even essential — supplement to other non - farming sources of income’ .",0
"At this stage we are only roughing - out our interview schedule , but the more attention we can give to detail now the more we are likely to be saving ourselves trouble later on . Decisions to postpone the actual wording or analysis categories can often be rationalized as being safeguards against too rigid a mental outlook on what may be a very exploratory field of research . But there are numerous instances which come to my mind of research in which all the problems of analysis were left until the survey had been done and then anything up to , or even over , a year was needed to sort out the tangled mass of answers to vague questions . Much of this sort of work is unnecessary if forethought is used at the planning stage .

It is merely a rough guide to the general sentencing levels that this court feels is appropriate , and allowance needs to be made for inconsistency on the part of the Court of Appeal itself ( Thomas , 1993 ) , plus the considerable ‘ latitude’ which is normally allowed before it will interfere with a sentence passed by the Crown Court .

To impute that Dr Runcie has been an unsuccessful archbishop by quoting falling numbers in that part of the Anglican Communion which is the Church of England is to ignore a whole complex of reasons for a reduction in church - going , including , no doubt , the encouragement of a highly competitive and success - orientated society . Numbers have dropped consistently for 60 years , and if that is the litmus - test of an archbishop 's success , then Archbishops Lang , Temple , Fisher , Ramsey and Coggan have also been failures .",0

"Such attitudes were familiar , for instance , in British imperial possessions in African India and American and there is no evidence that the Russian colonialists differed to any degree . In fact , the supposed readiness of Russians to ‘ accept’ baptized or otherwise assimilated natives as Russians is in itself a manifestation of the national arrogance of the Russians , which eventually engendered a sense of inferiority among many of the indigenous peoples . Meanwhile the latter were looked upon by most Russian settlers as fair game to be preyed upon in a variety of ways . Before the Russians came there was no landownership in Siberian although rights to the use of hunting - grounds , fishing - grounds and pastures were respected by tradition or asserted by force . Under Russian rule many native communities were deprived of such rights by sheer seizure of land ( zakhvat ) or by forfeiting territory as a result of pernicious debtor - contracts into which they had been duped by unscrupulous settlers .",0

"In short , a sufficient explanation of the differences in bargaining relations between states and enterprises must include consideration of changes in the security structure as well as to changes in the financial and production structures . It is not enough to say , as successive reports from the IMF or the World Bank have tended to do , that it all depends on governments and that it is up to them how the economy prospers . That is to beg the question of why any particular government was able to act or was constrained from acting in an economically optimal way . The political economist has to look behind policy choices to the structural context of international relations and to the context of the security structure influencing the definition of the role of the state in relation to markets , domestic and global . Managers would be well advised to do the same , for otherwise they will be blind to many of the causal forces at work .",0

"685 , 694 : ‘ I take it that’ the tenant ‘ has a right as against all the world to remain in possession until he is turned out by an order of the court.’ The difference between the literal meanings of those two statements of the law is illustrated by this case . I agree with the county court judge , in that I do not think that Lord Greene had in mind what we have to consider here , namely , the position of a tenant , a person who has been a statutory tenant ( I am not begging the question by using the word ‘ tenant’ but it is a convenient expression ) between the time when the order for possession is made and the time when it falls to be executed having regard to a suspension granted under section 5(2 ) of the Act of 1920 . I do not think that that point was in the mind of either Lord Greene or Scrutton L.J. , but the former in the words above quoted , expressed something with which I respectfully agree , and which seems plain , namely , that an absolute order for possession made against a tenant fundamentally alters the position .

"But if you think that the $ 2~trillion figure is already huge , the latest estimates by my research consultancy RGE ~ Monitor suggest that total losses on loans made by US financial firms and the fall in the market value of the assets they hold ( things like mortgage - backed securities ) will peak at about $ 3.6~trillion . US banks and broker dealers are exposed to about half of this figure , or $ 1.8~trillion ; the rest is borne by other financial institutions in the US and abroad . The capital backing the banks ’ assets was only $ 1.4~trillion last fall , leaving the US banking system some $ 400~billion in the hole , or close to zero even after the government and private - sector recapitalization of such banks . Another $ 1.5~trillion is needed to bring banks ’ capital back to pre - crisis level , which is needed to resolve the credit crunch and restore lending to the private sector .

"The masking can be consistent ( for example , top / bottom , left / right , middle / edges ) or it can change from frame to frame . The photographic image can be tampered with manually ; it can also be tampered with by being made darker or lighter or by altering the colours or colour balance . Again the ‘ norm’ itself is somewhat arbitrary in black and white and still more in colour , where , for example , many actors gain a reddish tone in their hair because the colour is balanced to give ‘ acceptable’pinkish / brown skin tones . The extension of the image in time lends itself to distortion by running the camera faster or slower than 24 fps ( or even backwards , as with the reversed slap across the face in Truffaut 's wonderful film about film making , Day for Night , 1973 ) .

"What , then , was his position ? It is said that , notwithstanding the order for possession , he was still a statutory tenant . To say that seems to me really to beg the question . It may well be that he could be described as a statutory tenant ; but that description would not itself accurately define his precise position , for he was a statutory tenant against whom a final order had been made , under which possession was to be delivered up on a fixed date , 3 April 1950 , he having died on the previous 8 March .

"In the event , a ) turns out to be peculiar insofar as this if the fourth time Eszterhas has reworked the basic theme of Jagged Edge ( see Betrayed and Music Box ) , of an authority figure hero suspecting that one of their nearest and dearest is responsible for appalling crimes . If you saw the other films , you wo n't need a gay activist to give away the ending , although the spin on the story here is that the hero is a male cop ( Douglas ) , as opposed to the female lawyers and FBI agents of the earlier movies . The loved one is an ice - cool blonde genius murder suspect ( Stone ) , and the finale is n't quite as cut - and - dried as expected , which gives protestors a problem : in order to give away the ending , they 'll have to understand it first .

However , it 's hardly fair to single out these strand because writer Eszterhas , gleefully backed up by director Verhoeven , links all forms of sexual activity to violence and death , with the heterosexual male hero spiralling out of control , led by his dick into drug abuse and manslaughter , and sweaty , beautifully - lit straight sex scenes segueing into bloody carnage .",0

"He was on a visit to his mother 's home at Londubh , Poolewe , during a holiday from boarding school in Fort Augustus . Sentence on Ballantine , a first offender , was deferred until 12 March for background reports , but Sheriff Donald Booker Millburn said it was possible he would impose a jail sentence . The case made Scottish legal history as it was the first prosecution under Section 3A of the Road Traffic Act 1988 . The section , introduced on 1 July last year — less than two weeks before the accident — made it an offence for a driver to cause death by careless driving and while over the drink drive limit .

"Jacqueline Sanchez , of the Ministry of Education , also points out that ; ‘ Over the years , since the revolution , many people have become much more demanding as far as education is concerned , and despite all the difficulties , are more critical and expect more of their schools.’ It is very difficult in the circumstances of either Mozambique or Nicaragua to evaluate conclusively the effectiveness of policies which promote education as a means of transforming society , although in the case of Nicaragua , despite the problems , government - sponsored initiatives clearly scored successes , both in educational terms and in terms of social change . However , any such strategy requires far more time and continuity of action and work to bear fruit . In both countries , undoubtedly one of the goals of what the United States euphemistically called ‘ low - intensity conflict’ was to hamper and discredit the revolutionary movements ' ability to deliver services to their peoples , and to involve them in changing their lives . Certainly in the case of Nicaragua , this strategy played an important part in undermining the undoubted popular support which the Sandinistas had enjoyed in the first part of the 1980s .",0

Eventually , as the winter darkness descended , the fighting ceased , both sides boasting of a victory , though as Argyll re - occupied Sheriffmuir the following morning he had the better claim to have won .",0

"Of ~ course , we should strive to ensure that money is spent as productively as possible , but humans , and human institutions , are fallible , and there are costs to ensuring that money is well spent . To put it in economics jargon , efficiency requires equating the marginal cost associated with allocation ( both in acquiring information about the relative benefits of different projects and in monitoring investments ) with the marginal benefits . In a nutshell : it is wasteful to spend too much money preventing waste . While the focus for the moment is on public - sector waste , that waste pales in comparison to the waste of resources resulting from a malfunctioning private financial sector , which in America already amounts to trillions of dollars . Likewise , the waste from not fully utilizing society 's resources – the inevitable consequence of not having had such a quick and strong stimulus – exceeds that of the public sector by an order of magnitude .",0

"Each situation should be approached by enquiring , for example , what are the goals involved , that is , ' what do I want ? ' , what are the boundaries to the situation , that is , ' what constraints do I not want to challenge ? ' , and what are the barriers to the goal , that is , ' what is blocking the path to where I want to be ? ' . In this way , situations can be redefined in ways which may be more useful for analysis . Successive abstractions : these define the situation in terms of higher and lower levels of abstraction . If we consider the exercise - bicycle market shown in figure 2.10 , for example , we could move to a higher level of abstraction to new fitness machines and to lower levels of abstraction which can reveal a whole range of possibilities . Analogies and metaphors : these redefine the problem in an imaginative , non - literal fashion .",1
"In particular there was a requirement under English law for children to support their parents financially . Sons carried this legal responsibility throughout their lives ; daughters relinquished it when they married . The nineteenth - century origins of these provisions are closely tied into a desire to hold down state expenditure and to ensure that the wealthier classes did not have to dig too deep into their pockets to support people who could not work for wages . In that sense , the poor Law was a mechanism whereby one class imposed a particular view of family responsibility upon another . However , we must beware of interpretations which are deceptively simple .",0

"Some owners are distressed to discover that , after months or years of ‘ clean’ behaviour , their pet cats start to leave messes around the house . In the past such animals have been models of cleanliness , always asking to go outside before defecating , or confining themselves to a modern litter tray . Now suddenly , for no apparent reason , they become careless and leave their faeces on the carpet . If there is no obvious explanation for this loss of restraint , what is the hidden one ? The first possibility is that the cat in question is ill or senile and its whole behaviour routine is starting to collapse .",1
"And only in a minute fraction of the actual collisions does theory suggest that a W particle will be produced ; many different processes compete to take place each time a proton and antiproton meet . Coupled with problems that arose with the apparatus — UA1 for example was beset by difficulties ranging from dirty air - lines to burst pipes — it was not until last November and December that the experiments were able to observe a large sample of proton - antiproton collisions . Now , it seems that the waiting may have borne fruit .

The following morning , Darriulat presented four events detected in UA2 .",0

"The passionate faith in the deep influence of the soil on man might at first sight appear to be an idea which a Marxist regime could easily harness to its own ideology , as was the Russian peasant 's deeply ingrained sense of co - operative toil on the land , a notion likewise derived from his dvoeverie . In accounts of religious opposition to the Bolsheviks , these possible points of convergence have always been overlooked . That they never bore fruit was due as much to Bolshevik neglect of them as to the eventual insistence from above on the abolition of the private farms . Another trait stemming from religious inspiration was the passive humility of the peasants . Quite apart from educational and other handicaps , this was one reason why they and even their social betters took so little part in government , leaving it so often to Balts or Germans before 1917 , and to other non - Russians after that date .",0

"By Hilary Applegate IF YOUR garden suffers from slow - draining surface water , slow plant growth or shallow rooting , it could pay dividends to find out whether a soil profile could provide you with a diagnosis . This involves an area of about one square yard of currently uncultivated land , together with a sturdy spade and lots of energy , for you are seeking evidence of an impermeable layer , or hard pan , down below the ground . You should dig a pit a yard deep ; for comfort while digging , this will need to be about a square yard in area . While excavating , take care to keep the different soil layers separate from each other , because each should be replaced at its original depth . Having completed the pit , look for signs of compaction : vertical roots turning 90 degrees to the horizontal at a particular level , or a layer which just looks hard and compacted , or a wet , grey or blue band between one and six inches deep .",1
"Recent advances in knowledge of thrust belts based on seismic and drilling have been made easier to apply to frontier areas by published descriptions of typical geometries , improved understanding of the mechanisms involved , and the establishment of standard terminology ( see , for instance : Hossack 1979 ; Berger and Johnson 1982 ; Butler 1982 ; Boyer and Elliot 1982 ) . The adaptation of similar ideas to extensional regimes ( Wernicke and Burchfield 1982 ; Gibbs 1983 , and this volume ) may prove particularly fruitful in unravelling the hidden structure of southern England . Warples ' ( 1980 ) adaptation of the Lopatin ( 1971 ) method of calculating source rock maturity , though open to theoretical objections , gives results which in many cases accord well with observed hydrocarbon occurrences , and has provided the petroleum geologist with a ready rule - of - thumb means of taking the time factor into account . This approach has been usefully extended to investigate the disturbance of the palaeogeothermal gradient caused by superimposing one rock slab onto another during overthrusting ( Edman and Surdam 1984 ; Furlong and Edman 1984 ) . The hydrocarbon prospects of the Variscan thrust belt in southern England can be examined from two angles : by analogy with results in the better explored lateral equivalents of the belt on the Continent and more particularly in eastern North America , and by an attempt to reconstruct the geometry and burial history of the pre - Permian rocks in the area of interest from the limited local clues available .",0
"Our economic expertise is limited in fundamental ways . Consider monetary and fiscal policies .

The remaining band members stayed on stage to perform a 15-minute instrumental version of ‘ Bombay Mix’ , a huge live favourite , which brought the house down … literally!’ The High then went offstage . They planned to go back on and complete their set with vocals from Cressa of The Stone Roses , who had been on the whole tour and knew most of the songs .",0

"Two years ago there was a similar , arguably worse , incident in Madrid when Real supporters threw sharp metal rods from behind a goal at the Bernabeu , narrowly missing Bayern Munich 's keeper , Jean - Marie Pfaff . He could have been killed . Real 's punishment was to play subsequent matches behind closed doors . Perhaps the Austria Vienna spokesman , Peter Mueller , had this in mind when he said yesterday : ‘ Compared with previous UEFA decisions in similar cases , Ajax 's punishment is very harsh.’ It opens the possibility , if there are repetitions , of the further denuding of European competition ; five former champions of the continent — Liverpool , Aston Villa , Nottingham Forest , Manchester United and Ajax — are now banned .",0

"Des Wilson is not a scientist but an activist ; he is indeed , as is said in the book , ‘ one of Britain 's most experienced and best - known campaigners on social issues’ . The Lead Scandal is manifestly a propaganda effort , as the title suggests , and his presentation of the evidence is rather one - sided , as well as being emotional and full of accusations of scientists and politicians with whom he disagrees . It is a very effective package , paperbacked with a threatening kind of picture on the cover ; it has a subtitle ( ’ The fight to save children from damage by lead in petrol’ ) which begs the question , and although it contains nothing but the truth , it certainly does not contain the whole truth . Lead Versus Health , edited by Michael Rutter and Robin Russell Jones , is written in a much more scientific and reasonable manner , and its 15 chapters , by various experts who are well - known as researchers in this field , give as comprehensive and impartial a survey of the evidence ( including new evidence ) as we are likely to get from any source . This makes the conclusion reached all the more impressive , and certainly forces one to take seriously the possibility that even low - level exposure to lead may have gravely deleterious effects on children 's behaviour and intelligence .",0

"Picture an enzyme at work Guy Riddihough OIL and water do n't mix . So how does pancreatic lipase , an enzyme that knocks around in the essentially aqueous environment of the small intestine , get to grips with fats and oils and break them down into the glycerol and fatty acids that are readily absorbed by the lining of the gut ? Several elements of the answer come together in the paper by H. van Tilbeurgh and colleagues on page 814 ; this is a sequel to the same group 's report of last year ( Nature 359 , 159–162 ; 1992 ) , discussed in News and Views in the same issue ( page 107 ) . The catalytic activity of pancreatic lipase , like that of a number of other lipases , is greatly when the enzyme comes into contact with a lipid/ water interface — this is the phenomenon known as interfacial activation .",0

"Buildings are not listed lightly : they have to come up to strict standards to qualify . If it is not listed , should it be ?

A rise of two brick courses ( 300 mm , or 6″ ) would therefore leave half of 350 mm , that is 175 mm ( almost 7″ ) , for the riser height . Although garden steps do n't have to conform to Building Regulations , steps which lead from the house to the patio are designated as being part of the house , so they do .",0

"Theories that attempt to unite Nature 's forces within one framework suggest that monopoles should have been produced in the early stages of the Universe : and just over a year ago Blas Cabrera , a researcher at Stanford University , thought he might have found one ( New Scientist . vol 94 , p 336 ) . But other experiments continue to draw blanks , as two recent papers in Physical Review Letters report . And three physicists writing in Nature show that monopoles are not the answer to a long - standing problem of solar physics — that of the ' missing ' solar neutrinos . According to the grand unified theories that link together electromagnetism with the weak and strong nuclear forces , monopoles are very heavy , with masses around 10 16 gaelectron - volts ( GeV ) .",0

"This was rejected on grounds of ease of use and familiarity with the 100 per cent marking scale . Nevertheless , it is acknowledged that disciplines maintain different marking conventions — differences that a grades - only system could reduce . Well known examples include the rare use of the 80–100 per cent range in arts and social studies and the full use of very high and very low marks in science and mathematics . Despite these traditions , analysis of student results does not indicate that it is more difficult to gain a first in arts than it is in science subjects . However , students gaining good degrees in the arts tend to have a very flat profile of marks clustering around the 70–75 per cent range , whereas science students show more peaks and troughs with marks often ranging from 65 to 85 per cent .",1

"Another popular explanation was offered by the German economist Wagener when he proposed his ‘ law of increasing state actions’ . What Wagener 's Law suggested was that the expansion of public services reflected the ‘ exigencies of industrialisation’— as a nation industrialises it develops needs for collectively provided goods such as roads , sewers transport , and so on . While the merits and demerits of this argument have been explored extensively , one major objection to it is that it begs the question of who identifies and defines the ‘ need’ for an expansion in public intervention , and how a perceived need results in specific policies that produce an expanded state sector . As in the other chapters , this chapter looks at three broad approaches to explaining the growth of government . MARXIST APPROACHES TO THE GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT",0

And if you cast your minds way back to Tuesday you will remember that what I said was that the Americans were trying to create a system of limited government er and yet one which er protected the liberties of individuals not all individuals , not black individuals especially but of individuals , this was the rhetoric of the time and the main device that they invented to do this was something called the separation of powers and they argued that , where political power is concentrated , the potential for abuse is greater so that where executive and legislative powers are held in the same hands , as they are in our system of government , the , there is more prospect of government encroaching upon the rights of individuals . Okay ? Now I also said that the states which make up the United States were , for a brief period , independent entities themselves in the gap between the ending of revolutionary war and the framing of the constitution and so when their representatives assembled in Philadelphia in the summer of seventeen eighty seven , they were mindful of their independence and they were jealous of that independence , they wished to protect it against encroachment , they did n't wish to exchange one form of dominance for another .",0

"Hybrid Tea bush types After attending to the basics or primary aspects — removing completely all dead , diseased and feeble wood ( you wo n't find much of this in the first year)— seek to prune to outward - pointing buds that will grow out along the line of growth , not sideways , so that this growth leads to an open cup or shuttlecock shape . At the first pruning , take each stem down to a suitable bud , so that ideally it is reduced to no more than 3–4 inches ( 8–10 cm ) in length . At the second and subsequent prunings , a widely advocated rule of thumb guide is to reduce the stem length by about a half .

If you cultivate and feed your plants well — we shall discuss both later — you should be able to make heavier demands .",0

"Andy Medhurst locates as ‘ the central visual themes of the 1950s male pin - up in Britain what one could call the hegemony of the tweed jacket or the ideology of gentrification’ . The dominant male of the period , like Kenneth More or Michael Dennison , was sexless , full of ‘ common sense’ , above all , decent : the exaggerated nature of the Edwardians ' dress , its appropriation from middle - class roots , and the obsessional nature with which they pursued it , all spoke of people who did not know their place . Having transgressed these invisible , but powerful , boundaries , the Teds were fair game for anything that could be thrown at them . ‘ A similar interpretation of a sexual twist ( homosexuality ) in the make up of Teddy Boys could be ascribed to their excessive interest in their own and each other 's clothes and hair - styles , such as the habit of the early Teddy Boys of having their hair waved.’ To contemporary commentators like Fyvel , the only other section of the population who behaved in such a way were the homosexuals ; what he did n't know was that this pursuit of pleasure , and concentration on self , were exactly those traits that would become desirable , and eventually , socially acceptable , with the extraordinary success of Elvis Presley and the Teen age that followed .",0

"Part of the answer to this question is suggested by the marriage analogy . The expected stability and duration of political institutions is an important value in itself , since they allow for long - term planning . Conversely , if all institutions are up for grabs all the time , individuals in power will be tempted to milk their positions for private purposes , and those outside power will hesitate to form projects which take time to bear fruit . Moreover , if nothing could ever be taken for granted , there would be large deadweight losses arising from bargaining and factionalism . Another part of the answer is that not all unwise decisions can be undone .",0
"In the next year , old emergency tenders at eight of the nine 24-hour stations in the county will be replaced by the most advanced fire engines , costing £ 92,000 each . And many specialist machines are to be replaced by new equipment making full use of the latest technology . The changes come after an 18-month review conducted by the chief fire officer , Mr Alf Thompson , and received all - party support at a committee meeting held behind closed doors . They included a change in name from Durham County fire brigade to Durham County fire and rescue brigade . One of the more controversial decisions is to move the heavy rescue unit , used in major road accidents , to the Bishop Auckland station from Darlington .",0

"Notwithstanding that the transfer is not lodged for registration or registration is refused , the beneficial interest in the shares will , it seems , pass from the seller to the buyer at the latest at stage ( 2 ) and , indeed will do so at stage ( 1 ) if the agreement is one which the courts would order to be specifically enforced . The seller then becomes a trustee for the buyer and must account to him for any dividends he receives and vote in accordance with his instructions ( or appoint him as his proxy ) . This , however , begs several questions . The first arises because at stage ( 2 ) delivery of the documents may not necessarily be matched by payment of the full price ; the agreement may have provided for payment by instalments and the seller will then retain a lien on the shares as an unpaid seller . This will not prevent an equitable interest passing to the buyer but the court will not grant specific performance unless the seller 's lien can be fully protected and until paid in full he is entitled to vote the shares as he thinks will best protect his interest .",0

"Buildings behave in much the same way . A typical building of 10 storeys will sway back and forth in a period of 1 second , giving it a natural frequency of 1 cycle per second or 1 hertz . As a rule of thumb , every storey makes a difference of one - tenth of a second to a building 's period . So a 20-storey building has a period of about 2 seconds , a natural frequency of 0.5 hertz ; a five - storey building has a period of half a second , a natural frequency of 2 hertz . Buildings above 20 storeys fare relatively well in earthquakes .",0

"Accidents involving bathers are especially common in the waters off north - eastern Australia , but happily an effective anti - venin is now available .

In the years that I have had to research my Bombing Years lectures I realise now that we never really got to grips with the German defences until the latter stages of the war . I am aware that there was a steady decrease in the casualty figures and this was welcome to the Harris Offensive and also to the Mighty Eighth , but it always appeared to be that the Luftwaffe were just that one step ahead until , of course , the advent of D - Day and the advance of the Allies on the Continent .

"At a local level sponsors so often are involved in the club on a more direct way but it is n't always seen as a problem and can be enormously beneficial to both parties . Sponsorship on a wider basis is much more difficult to manage . Sponsorship should of course be the icing on the cake , there should be enough in , in competition in regattas and themselves but people are interested enough to go and to support and that sponsorship actually allows you to do things that you would n't have been able to do otherwise . The danger of course is that sponsorship for itself , in itself becomes more important than the actual regattas . Th we must be able to learn from this period , particularly a partial austerity mm but these events are sound events in themselves and that we 're not just doing it for the sake of the sponsor or attracting a sponsor and that it 's not , in itself , completely necessary to have a sponsor otherwise the competition would n't exist .",0

"Nylon does have an exasperating trait of expanding in the wet and cold , causing the fly to sag .

"The balance of forces is between implosive gravitation and explosive nuclear reaction . When nicely balanced , these forces permit the star a lifecycle as it radiates energy to finish as a lump of heavy elements . If imbalance occurs , then the star may explode as a supernova , or implode to entrap its own radiation in a black hole . Such an equilibrium of forces is not symmetry . On the other hand it is not chaos , and within the context of this essay it is regarded as asymmetry … a balance of dissimilar forces .",1
"Others , however , assume the reverse . For them the death in our family is the result of their successful and fully justified vengeance - magic in return for an earlier killing in their family . So one killing , mystically interpreted either as the result of witchcraft , or of its antithesis vengeance - magic , cancels another and the slate is wiped clean . Clearly everything depends upon the point of view that is adopted , and upon rival interpretations of the same events . Zande conceptions are sufficiently flexible to permit the selection of explanations according to one 's position and interests .",0
"As Appendix II , and indeed the main survey results , make clear , it is not necessarily low income which makes credit at the same time both an obvious refuge and an unduly heavy burden — though in the main survey we found that in general people on low incomes were more likely to say that they were worried about money than people on high incomes . In any income range , people can find it difficult to make ends meet — especially with steep inflation . What is clear is that when people do resort to credit to make ends meet , their anxieties increase . Detailed cross - tabulations of our main survey results ( not included in Appendix I ) showed that people who said they worried about money fairly often or very often on average had a markedly higher credit commitment than people who said they did not worry about money . And people who had bought their most recent non - routine purchase on credit — especially on HP or mail order — tended to worry more about money than people who had bought for cash .",0
"A match is found when a user has all of the roles specified within the model or a superset of them .

"' The YMCA does not like to plant a home like this and then run it centrally , ' said Mr King .

Understandably , it was an appeal which captured the imagination of thousands . Now there has been real concern voiced about the delay in getting the unit off the ground .",0
"Constructing a stable representation of the environment from this ever - changing view is the function of spatial learning and it is therefore likely that the inclusion of objects into an animal 's representation of allocentric space will depend on their geometric stability . Our findings suggest that this inclusion is the primary determinant of whether a landmark will be used to predict where something else is located . The rule - of - thumb that ‘ if it moves , do n't use it as a landmark’ does not prevent a moving object from acquiring associative strength ( as a century of maze studies with randomly placed discriminative cues has long established ) . Instead , associative strength becomes attached to the object and can , in the present case , only trigger approach or avoidance of the landmarks themselves ( the phenomenon of autoshaping ) . The dissociation further implies that rats can detect relative spatial proximity even under circumstances in which they do not represent it in memory .",0
"It certainly does not per se affect the nature , quality or value of the land either during or at the end of the term . It does not per se affect the mode of using or enjoying that which is demised . And to ask whether it affects the landlord qua landlord or the tenant qua tenant is an exercise which begs the question … Whilst it is true that the deposit is paid to the original payee because it is security for the performance of contractual obligations assumed throughout the term by the payer and because the payee is the party to whom the contract is entered into , it is , in their Lordships ' view , more realistic to regard the obligation as one entered into with the landlord qua payee rather than qua landlord … The nature of the obligation is simply that of an obligation to repay money which has been received and it is neither necessary nor logical , simply because the conditions of repayment relate to the performance of covenants in a lease , that the transfer of the reversion should create in the transferee an additional and co - extensive obligation to pay money which he has never received and in which he never had any interest or that the assignment of the term should vest in the assignee the right to receive a sum which he has never paid …",0
"Granted better luck he should get his head back in front and is likely to start at a reasonable price in this company .

"If they are placed in secondary roles , or it is assumed that women 's identity is to be found in mothering , then the fact of their presence reinforces a certain understanding of the feminine .

"Pinned suddenly by the man 's dark gaze , Leith was all at once certain that Travis 's cousin had made up his mind in advance that she was more interested in Travis 's financial status than Travis himself .

"It was no longer necessary , when building a moderate sized house , to be completely practical and simply to provide shelter — people had more money and thus concentrated more on pleasing their eye . Restrop is of as perfect and pure a style as Elizabethan houses of this size ever reached . It is built on the shape of the letter ‘ E’ , not necessarily as a compliment to Queen Elizabeth but for the satisfactory symmetry it afforded to the most important east - facing front which the world and his wife could view as they passed by . It was built around 1590 for a younger son of the Earl of Shaftesbury , whose family had owned the manor of Restrop for three hundred years , The coat of arms of the Ashley - Coopers ( the Shaftesbury family name ) is over the door , and it is very unlikely that such a very fine house , with its particularly beautiful roofs over the projecting bays , would have been built for a tenant farmer . There is a local story that Queen Elizabeth spent a night here ; what is certain is that she passed on this road on her way from Burderop to Cirencester .",0

"The delays are very varied and multiple repeats stay true to the original tone , as do the chorus and pitch - shifted sounds . Subtle use of the EQ here can help add sparkle , or crispen a flat - sounding amp ; conversely it can dull a digital sound to create an analogue type effect . The rotary encoder makes light work of selecting the various effects and parameters and the keypad 's addition of ‘ Patch Recall’ is useful in the studio ( you can dial a patch number on the keypad , thus saving time running through the encoder ) . Also useful in the studio should be the onboard sampler , but with only 1.30 seconds of sampling time available it 's obviously limited in what it can do . Drum samples should be alright , though , and the sample patch I tried had its own reverb , which could be very useful for snares and toms .",0

"Since the mechanism by which equilibrium is attained is not in general specified ( although see Tobin , 1955 , Solow , 1956 , and Meade , 1961 ) , it is a heroic assumption . Within the confines of an equilibrium model , the specification of the savings function needs careful consideration . In much of the literature , savings are assumed to be based on rules of thumb . The proportional savings case is an instance of this . Another common assumption is that of ‘ classical’ savings , where there are different propensities to save by type of income or class .",0
"For instance , there is usually a starting assumption that individuals make history , at least by the sum of their actions and even if not quite as they intended it to be . In that case the simplification is warranted because it encapsulates a truth about what is going on . But the general proposition that human affairs must be understood from within does not require the assumption that individuals make history , except perhaps as a convenient device for identifying what calls for deeper understanding . Individualism is a possible , indeed common , trump suit in the search for the meaning and true interpretation of social events : but , we shall find in later chapters , it is by no means the only possible one . An ‘ inside’ story can also be told in terms which subordinate individuals to some larger social whole .",0

What higher confidence could a Christian have than to reflect that in heaven the risen Christ in his ascended manhood ' is around ' on our behalf ?",1
"It was a great shock to the Girls when Jennie died on 21 February , 1936 . Although she had been seen at the school less frequently over the past few years , rehearsals and contracts were organized so smoothly that the dancers had not noticed her gradual disappearance . Whereas John 's will had been full of retribution , Jennie in one sentence thanked the thirteen people she considered important in her life and asked that they should simply ‘ share and share alike’ .

This view sounds consistent with the philosophy often cited by groups of service users — that standards should be consistent across the country and that people should have minimum entitlements to services wherever they live . But it sits uneasily with the often - heard principle that ' local services should respond to local needs ' . It also begs a question about whether the government is changing its tune ? John Major is the first prime minister in 40 years to have any background in local government . So there could be reason to think his administration would bring a new dawn for local democracy .,0
"Although these years witnessed a very low tide of economic activity including the horrors of widespread famine and even peasant revolts in some areas like Tambov , problems concerning religious belief and taxation never led to large - scale uprisings in the Smolensk guberniia ( nor indeed anywhere else in Russia ) . After all , the Civil War was over in most areas , so the peasants ' best chance of retaliation , by linking up with local White armies , was lost . Again , Lenin 's promise that the main aim of NEP was to restore peasant fortunes did begin to bear real fruit before the end of 1922 . Yet through most of the year many government promises remained on paper . The Bolshevik Party was therefore especially eager to win over minds by means of cultural and ideological propaganda and education .",0
"Sometimes they would stroll under the leafy canopies of the Mardyke , where the river was not a river at all but a stream — his father used to say that you could n't even call it a branch of the Lee , perhaps a twig at best— often dried - up in summer and so narrow that he could nearly have jumped across it if he had been allowed ; at other times their route would take them down the Marina where the river was a broad rink - like expanse that copied in shimmering reflections the haughty hills of Montenotte drawing themselves up from its other side .

"In other words , the cyclothymic become hypomanic , the schizoid more withdrawn , and the hypersensitive somewhat paranoid . In the light of the foregoing , psychiatry itself is increasingly being forced to admit that the firm categories of psychosis with which it has tried to work for many years are of limited value . It may be asked why psychiatry has made such heavy weather of coming round to that view . The main reason has been its long standing commitment ( still evident in some quarters ) to the idea that each of the different forms of functional psychosis is really a distinct type of brain disease , equivalent to those studied in neurology . In other words , psychiatrists have used as their analogy disorders such as Huntington 's chorea or Alzheimer 's disease , which are known ( or can be assumed ) to have a discrete organic cause in the nervous system and which are like other infective or degenerative physical diseases , except that they happen to affect the brain .",0

The flower - head turning behaviour , adaptive or not , is a ' given ' property of the organism , fixed within its genetic and developmental programme .",1
"Capital Equipment — Computers Jane Daly has just given me a copy of the new Capital Equipment RTP forms . The procedures look fine for the purchase of one - off and novel items , but it occurs to me that it would save time and effort if we established ' preferred suppliers ' for standard PCs , printers , and peripherals , so that we do n't have to obtain multiple quotes and give reasons for supplier choice each time we order an off - the - shelf system . This sort of procedure is well established in other organizations , such as the University , and provided the preferred suppliers are properly chosen in the first place , and alternative source prices are kept under review at regular intervals , I think there are economic advantages in standardising suppliers . Should we table this for discussion next Computing meeting ?",0

"Where Markus Stenz led , the orchestra followed as best they could although some wayward ensemble , especially from the woodwind , dulled the edges . Sombre , though with a pacy , filmic sequencing he whipped up the orchestra to a marvellously stylish finale . Ever demonstrative , Markus Stenz clearly aimed at the dramatic in Beethoven 's Symphony No4 and digging deep , uncovered hidden orchestral reserves bringing a satisfying degree of tension and thrill to the first movement . But overall , the effect was patchy , the Scherzo lacklustre and the Adagio aimless . Haydn 's Nelson Mass may have overt marshall overtones , but this was surely little excuse for what , at times , descended to little more than an inglorious romp .",0

Long periods of lone quiet sleep may be one factor that contributes to a higher rate of sudden deaths in white than in Asian infants . Introduction",1

"If that gap is n't narrowed , we could well see a backlash as business doing their bit for the environment lose heart at the apparent lack of consumer interest .

Holidays That Do n't Cost the Earth ( Gollancz , £ 5.99 ) is a lively , informative read : as good a way as any of getting to grips with environment - friendly holidays .

"This point is well illustrated in ' The Disappearance ' after the death of one of the main characters at the very end of the book . Despite an unhappy ending , ' The Disappearance ' contains a lot of energy which made me come away from the book feeling hopeful and while I learnt more about the characters , I also found I learnt more about myself and my feelings towards family life and friends . Rosa Guy is also very descriptive and emotional in her writing , one of my favourite descriptions is on pages 53–54 which tells us how Mrs Aimsley has all her glasses set out on shelves and the higher the shelf , the more expensive the glass and of course not being used to drinking out of glasses , Imamu takes the most expensive type from which to drink milk and syrup and after washing and drying it , he put it back on the shelf , but as he takes his hand away , the glass tips over and falls , smashing on the sink . The reason I like this section is because I like the way Mrs Aimsley thinks , the more expensive her glass , the better a position it deserves on one of her shelves . One of my favourite emotional scenes in this book is on page 79 when Mrs Aimsley suddenly changes her views on Imamu , especially after it was her who decided to bring Imamu into her family after sitting in court listening to Imamu on trial for murder .",1

"He turned to the counsellor . ‘ Now I suppose you are going to say that I have not mentioned the word lover , but I always think it 's ludicrous to call one 's wife one 's lover .

"The pair 's work is founded on the philosophy that ‘ Nature knows best’ , as US biologist Barry Commoner put it — pithily if controversially — in his seminal 1970 book on ecology , The Closing Circle . In it , he describes numerous man - made intrusions into the natural environment which have had disastrous side - effects , making the point that the connections within natural systems are often so complex , and the effects of changes so unpredictable , that it is wise to ensure the good imitative ‘ fit’ of any intervention . In the design of artificial ecosystems , also , imitation of nature is the best rule of thumb , the Shields believe . Their first project , the design of a wetland to treat household sewage from a hotel a few miles from Drumnadrochit and Loch Ness , exemplifies this belief . The system , located below the outfall from the hotel 's septic tank and apparently comprising no more than a marshy , plant - filled hollow , blends easily into the informal garden .",0

"The ability to collapse their lung air - sacs with increasing depth is probably the dolphin 's major protection against the bends . Like seals and other diving animals , dolphins exhibit bradycardia -the slowing of the rate of heart beat . Bottlenose dolphins have a heart rate of 80–90 beats per minute just after ‘ blowing’ , slowing within a few seconds to 33–45 beats per minute and remaining at that rate until the next blow . On surfacing , the rate again speeds up , generally remaining at the higher level until the carbon dioxide content of the exhaled air has returned to normal — usually in a few seconds .

"Though his first political sympathies were with the Union and the right - wing of the Conservative party , William Joyce subsequently held English misgovernment to blame for the loss of Ireland . By yielding to the seduction of ‘ international finance’ instead of following the stern duty of imperial economy , weak and corrupt administrations in London had created Irish poverty and resentment . Writing in Berlin in 1940 , he put the matter in a nutshell : If one sixth of the money invested and lost outside the Empire , in South America alone , for example , had been given to Ireland , there might have continued that cooperation between her and England which provided British history with Burke , Goldsmith , Wellington , Boyle , Roberts , French , Beatty and Carson . As though , however , by an inevitable destiny , International Finance wound its coils through the heart of England , and its venom was carried throughout the bloodstream to the whole Colonial and Imperial system .",0

"When other changes are taken into account couples with children are also seen to be considerably worse off . Particularly significant to families with children has been the loss of single payments and their replacement by loans . It is alarming that families with children who accept a social fund loan have to try to make ends meet on 85 per cent of their normal income support entitlement . Furthermore , all families on income support have to pay 20 per cent of the community charge and the whole of their water charges , and although the rates of income support include an allowance to cover the community charge payment , it is quite insufficient to compensate for the extra expenditure . Housing benefit has also been drastically cut : many claimants have lost entitlement altogether and the majority of those still in receipt of benefit are worse off .",0
"Johnson declared himself in favour of such prescribed succession : ' His opinion was that so much land should be entailed as that families should never fall into contempt , and as much left free as to give them all the advantages in case of any emergency .

Emboldened by an alliance with Britain made in 1902 , Japan attacked Russian forces in January 1904 and proceeded to inflict a series of devastating defeats upon her by land and sea .

"Details of father 's occupation in cancer registration and mortality records did not suggest any excess of oil related jobs among the fathers of cases living in rural high oil areas . Moreover , a comparison of the names of all rural oil workers with those of fathers of children with leukaemia or non - Hodgkin 's lymphoma in 1979–83 ( ascertained for another study ) produced only a single match . Incidence in the rural high oil category was examined in more isolated ( > 20 km from urban areas ) and less isolated sectors , and at higher and lower levels of certain factors , for which the division was made after ranking the sectors on the factor ( disregarding isolation ) at the point that as closely as possible halved the cumulative expected values at ages 0–14 . The increased incidence at ages 0–4 was restricted to postcode sectors more than 20 km from urban areas , where it was greater in sectors of higher social class ( table V ) .

"On the other hand , it might he argued that when he moves from the concept of impersonal truth to the concept of a personal God , he is distinguishing , in traditional Advaitin fashion , between higher and lower levels of truth or reality . But acceptance of this argument involves acceptance of the superiority of the higher , impersonal level of truth over the lower personal level of truth and the acknowledgment of two levels of knowledge . Gandhi , as we have seen , sees no superiority in conceiving of God in impersonal rather than personal terms so it is difficult to see how the traditional distinction between higher and lower levels of truth can be applied to him . The fact that he uses both personal and impersonal descriptions of God supports this point . If the question is asked whether Gandhi is not aware of the dangers of contradiction in his use of personal and impersonal terms to describe God , the answer might be that it would depend whether the personal use of the term God refers to an entity , or being , in the form of an extra - mundane person , whether or not a contradiction is involved .",1

Such work as ‘ Reading for Learning in Science’(Davies and Greene ) and Michael Hoey 's work based on Eugene Winter 's pioneering analysis of academic discourse are possible models for a serious contribution at the second level . One red herring that has been produced by increased language awareness among teachers has been to try to rewrite academic texts so that pupils can cope with them . In my view this is an evasion of the teacher 's duty to enable pupils to get to grips with academic language . This is established as the language of academic discourse in all disciplines throughout the world . Scientists and politicians are not going to change their language to suit the alleged capacities of pupils in schools .,0

"This gave their office a quasi - priestly function . At the turn of the eleventh and twelfth centuries the Norman Anonymous ( formerly known as the Anonymous of York ) wrote that ‘ the king reigns with Christ’ , reflecting the common doctrine of the tenth and early eleventh centuries that the king was Christ 's vicar , that he was rex et sacerdos , that although he could not administer the sacraments , he ruled over the Church as well as over his temporal kingdom , that all authority was vested in him . When the Anonymous wrote this doctrine was under a cloud and his writings are a fascinating mixture of the new logic of the late eleventh century and views of kingship of an extreme conservatism . Times were changing ; the popes had abolished the use of chrism in the imperial anointing , had denied the authority of kings over priests ; the time would shortly come when the popes themselves claimed to be vicars of Christ , and interpreted the phrase to mean that in the last analysis all earthly authority was mediated through them , not through kings . But we must not be confused by this : a wide variety of views had been held on the relations of popes and emperors , bishops and kings , in the tenth century ; a wide variety was still held in the twelfth .",0

"Then , when Warners sued her for breach of contract , she reluctantly agreed to return to the studio corral while making certain that the trade press was fully apprised of her frustration . As it happened , the gamble paid off handsomely . The studio almost immediately cast her in a cycle of prestigious ( if often meretricious)‘women 's pictures’ , including Edmund Goulding 's Dark Victory ( 1939 ) , which had her , in its famous climactic scene , walk upstairs to die in solitude with all the dignified serenity of an elephant trundling off to its ancestral graveyard ; Michael Curtiz 's The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex ( also 1939 ) , in which she flaunted the Virgin Queen 's ( and her own ) baldness as the ultimate emblem of great , self - abasing character acting ; and , of course , Irving Rapper 's sudsy , multi - Kleenex tearjerker Now , Voyager ( 1942 ) , in which her repressed , plain - Jane spinster blossoms overnight into chic , radiant , cigarette - tapping womanhood . Of this last film the Argentinian fabulist Jorge Luis Borges laconically wrote : ‘ The vigorous message of Now , Voyager is : When Bette Davis is disfigured , she is less beautiful.’ In the late Forties , just as her career was sinking to its lowest ebb , and an English critic commented of her notorious egomania that ‘ only bad films are good enough for her’ , she returned in triumph with one of her most brilliant performances , as the ageing but feisty actress Margo Channing who , to her emotional and professional cost , learns All About Eve ( directed by Joseph L.

Here was the embodiment of evil , the Scapegoat , and with his imminent destruction wickedness would be symbolically cast out and the townspeople would be once more on the side of the angels .

"Nor has the tenor of British business life been much adorned by individuals so ready to dress up lies as the truth and , through their lawyers , to castigate the truth as libel .

"When a high head is followed by a rise the stressed syllables tend to move downwards , as one would expect , towards the beginning pitch of the tone : Of course , when we examine the intonation of polysyllabic heads we find much greater variety than these simple examples suggest . However , the division into high and low heads as general types is probably the most basic that can be made , and it would be pointless to set up a more elaborate system to represent differences if these differences were not recognised by most English speakers . Some writers on intonation claim that the intonation pattern starting at a fairly high pitch , with a gradual dropping down of pitch during the utterance , is the most basic , normal , ‘ unmarked’ intonation pattern ; this movement is often called declination . The claim that declination is universally unmarked in English , or even in all languages , is a strong one .",1

The one - way traffic of black children into white families begs fundamental questions of power and ideology . It raises questions as to the type of relationship which exists between black and white people and , furthermore , the type of society that those involved in the practice are creating .

"In what became the biggest spending spree the club with the Scrooge image has ever embarked on , Nicholas returned home to Parkhead along with his former Arsenal teammate Martin Hayes and another old Celtic Boys ' Club stalwart , the ex - Hibernian midfield player John Collins . When Nicholas returned to Parkhead to play his home debut in a showpiece friendly against Everton he was greeted with rapturous applause . The prodigal son had returned to Parkhead . Ironically , in his biography , written soon after his move to Arsenal , Charlie Nicholas had vowed he would never darken Celtic 's door again . ‘ Since I left , there has been talk about my going back to Celtic , but that will never happen.’",0
"Even in the early ' 50 's of this century , people of the Ambleside area would show with pride prints by William Green of Ambleside . Now , alas , it is some of the ‘ off - comers’ who collect and prize his work , mostly his paintings : perhaps this is fitting , since for all his 23 years of residence at Ambleside,(he was 40 when he moved there ) he was an ‘ off - comer’himself . The days of the popularity of black and white etchings waned at the turn of this century : the demand was filled by photographic views , first in black and white and then in colour . His work , to be discussed in a later chapter , was very uneven . Some of it , though , rises well above mediocrity ; and the part he played in popularising the Lake District was unquestionable .",1

"At least that 's what we 've been told by the seat - cover suppliers , Courtaulds Textiles , which produces the terribly natty ‘ Renaissance’ decor for Rover 's new Metro . No sooner had Courtaulds read the comments by our Metro 's previous keeper , Jill Stanton — that the material had developed ‘ bobbly sweater syndrome’(25 July ) than they were inspecting the offending objects with microscopes and pronouncing themselves shocked and baffled . They had checked similar seats that had been subjected to the rough and tumble of Metropolitan Police life , and ones that had supported over 70,000 miles , and they were all right as rain . So into the garage the car went to have the seats changed — under warranty , of course— and the ‘ bad’ pair couriered to Courtaulds for full forensic examination , results of which will be known by the next Running Report . The operation took no more than 10 minutes and , once again , was carried out courteously and efficiently by Brunt and Davies , my wallet staying firmly in my pocket .",0

"Afterwards Stella was convinced she had been rebuked . She began to wonder whether St Ives 's abrupt departure had n't been occasioned by her ill judged remark rather than by Geoffrey 's calling out of the quarter hour .

Certainly Dotty was less effusive in her thanks when Stella brought her up a tray of tea in the interval . And half way through the second act , when Ptolemy accused Caesar of driving him from his palace and Caesar said , ‘ Go , my boy , I will not harm you ; but you will be safer away , among your friends , here you are in the lion 's mouth’ , Stella imagined St Ives spoke more severely than usual .",1

"Despite their hefty involvement with Doctor Who for over two years neither Raymond Cusick nor Barry Newbery designed the TARDIS . That task fell to Polish - born Designer Peter Brachaki .

"For older people to have the opportunity to participate not only on juries but in other civic activities after they retire , the major proposals must be : the end of any age discrimination for voluntary participation in the statutory and the voluntary sectors , especially and initially from those bodies who have it within their own control so to devise and endorse ; the promotion of the Rule of Three in Ten as a rule of thumb for all organisations in the formation of committees , boards and the like ; the establishment of forms of fixed terms of appointment , assessment , review etc which obviate the need to use age as a convenient tool ; the continuance of the pressure on insurers to change their practice .",0

"Groups like Microdisney and Danny Wilson , who try to use MOR in order to get their messages over to as many people as possible , are doubly misguided . How can words stir anyone to action or even reflection if the accompanying music fails to quicken the pulse ? And is n't it the case that real MOR — the stuff that sells , boys — has words that are anodyne too , that reinforce commonsense views of normality and ( human ) nature ? More than any other group I can think of , Microdisney are victims of rock 's over - privileging of the text . The words , and the need to get those words within earshot of the maximum number of people , have subordinated the music to the level of glossy paper — designed to interfere with clear transmission and reception of the message as little as possible .",1

"The effect of being rich ( + 0.068 ) is seen to be pretty small . Confirmatory techniques exist to assess how likely a difference of proportions of a given magnitude is to arise in sample data when it has been drawn from a population in which no such difference exists . As a rule of thumb , when d s get down much below 0.05 , we can regard them as so small that they might just be a sampling fluke ; we will conclude that for all practical purposes there is no effect of one variable upon another , and erase arrows with very small path coefficients from our model . The original effect of being rich in figure 13.2 ( + 0.144 ) was spuriously high ; it was a product of the fact that young people are more likely to be rich and young people are also more likely to contemplate breaking the law . The operation of these two age effects is not , however , strong enough to actually reverse the sign of the relationship between income and law - breaking .",0

"There are also technical limitations . A well - known picture book of Italian art alone contains more than 4,000 reproductions , yet histories of art , as we have seen , contain fewer , sometimes much fewer than 1,000 plates .

Again , the need for the deeply interested reader to supplement a survey with other books becomes evident .

"They could not have made change of land use profits . In Cramlington they could and did , not only from housing land but also through their subsidiary which developed the town shopping centre , which again in a designated New Town would have been a development corporation function . All this was above board and the developers reached an agreement to pay a per acre developed contribution to the district council towards development costs , as did the county council . They also sold infrastructure and public sector housing land to the councils at historic cost plus interest rather than developed land value .

"Perhaps our common reason is not any prediction about the number of cases of injustice that the checkerboard strategy would produce or prevent , but our conviction that no one should actively engage in producing what he believes to be injustice . We might say : no checkerboard statute could be enacted unless a majority of the legislators voted for provisions they thought unjust . But this objection begs the main question . If each member of the legislature who votes for a checkerboard compromise does so not because he himself has no principles but because he wants to give the maximum possible effect to the principles he thinks right , then how has anyone behaved irresponsibly ? Even if we were to accept that no legislator should vote for the compromise , this would not explain why we should reject the compromise as an out - come .",0

"It is bad enough for the club hacker in the monthly medal , but infinitely worse for a tournament professional when there is a great deal of prize money at stake plus those vital Ryder Cup points . Another problem was that the show business element attracted a different kind of spectator .

So there were large numbers of spectators who simply had no idea that you should be quiet when a golfer is about to hit a shot .

"In the 1477/8 parliament his position there was further strengthened by the exchange of Elfael , which had come to him with the Neville land but which was peripheral to his main Welsh interests , for the duchy of Lancaster lordship of Ogmore , which complemented his holdings in Glamorgan . It is not clear who initiated the exchange , which benefited both sides , but the transaction demonstrates that the king was willing to strengthen Gloucester 's hold on the region , and the result was a compact power base . Ducal influence in the region has , however , been judged remote and ineffectual , a verdict based largely on Gloucester 's inability to get to grips with the problems caused by the decaying system of local office holding . Certainly , by the time Gloucester secured these Welsh estates , the north had emerged decisively as his main sphere of activity . Whereas East Anglia might have become a second power base in the early 1470s , Gloucester 's Welsh lands were never expected to be more than peripheral .",0

Council drops action against paper By Alan Forbes MONKLANDS District Council became the target of fresh accusations yesterday after it abandoned legal action against the local newspaper that had run a campaign against an alleged jobs - for - the - boys ' mafia .

It was the reappearance of Harold Wilson in the driving - seat of government which prompted this . The official stayed and , in later years , coined the best metaphor for the Wilson style : Harold as the great player of Space Invaders taking the first blip to cross the screen whether it was important or not . Wilson 's own choice of metaphor was no longer that of the centre forward , but the seasoned centre half feeding passes to his experienced forwards and allowing them to score the goals .",0

This sceptical argument is crucial . It shows that it is no use simply announcing that you can conceive of another 's pain on the grounds that you can suppose that what he has is the same as what you have . This easy remark ( see ( b ) above ) begs the question against the relevant argument .

"Where a listed company promotes an on - market "" buy - in "" of its shares , where the shareholders usually sell to an intermediary and the intermediary sells back to the company , the capital gains tax rules , rather than the ACT / distribution regime , will also apply as far as the vendor shareholders are concerned . Whichever buy - in regime applies , stamp duty is payable by Target at one - half per cent on the return of the cancelled shares . As a rule of thumb , if Target has sufficient distributable reserves to effect the purchase of its own shares , it will also have sufficient capacity to carry back against the preceding six years ' mainstream corporation tax all the ACT incurred on the distribution , so this should not be a real cost . Where , on a buy - in , the purchase price of Target 's shares is equal to or less than the subscription price ( ie , nominal value plus any share premium ) , there will not be any distribution within s209 so no ACT will be payable , but there will be a capital gains tax disposal by the shareholders .

"Everyone is well aware that the considered official record is as much a simplification ( even if of a different sort and for different reasons ) as is the news story filed by reporters for press and television — the actors , the reporters , the academic researchers , and , one hopes , the public too . The assumptions raise deeper questions . For instance , there is usually a starting assumption that individuals make history , at least by the sum of their actions and even if not quite as they intended it to be . In that case the simplification is warranted because it encapsulates a truth about what is going on . But the general proposition that human affairs must be understood from within does not require the assumption that individuals make history , except perhaps as a convenient device for identifying what calls for deeper understanding .",0

"It 's a very simple tactic : a gang of at least five or six young , strong , aggressive types select an isolated victim on a platform or in a train carriage , steam into them with fists and feet , rob them and steam away again . The attack is effective because it is so fast — a sort of mugger 's ‘ blitzkrieg’— and the dust has usually settled before anyone even realizes what has happened . Steaming is not restricted to tube trains : it happens on buses , in shops and even department stores where large items are stolen en masse in broad daylight . At one point , the number of steaming attacks in Oxford Street reached such a peak that Scotland Yard formed a special squad to deal with it . The possibility of being attacked on public transport is still low , especially if you avoid the more notorious stations , such as those in Central London and at the southern end of the Northern Line .",0
"However expert we may be in a fairly narrow field we are laymen to one another . I 'm a layman to you and you 're a layman to me in many senses , and therefore erm the , the , the fact that our students are in effect very often laymen is not something that detracts from their motivation to study , in many instances it 's something that gives it stimulus and underlines it . There 's another aspect to what we do , and that is that I think we are part of a very powerful developing movement in education , and it is based on the concept that education should not stop with the terminal rituals of school and college , and that education should be as much part of life , wanting to know , to find out , to get to grips with the body of information and knowledge that 's available in society . And in a relatively small way , but when you think of the other universities doing the same sort of thing , in a larger way , we are offering this kind of opportunity to people . I think there 's one other thing that 's worth thinking about , and that is that many of our students come into the University for one - day schools , for lectures , for activities of this kind , and this gives an opportunity for a kind of reciprocal traffic , if you like , so that people outside who often have very odd ideas of what universities do and what they 're about and what they 're like , can actually see your University , participate in its activities , and we can see ordinary folk who sometimes ask the shrewdest questions and make sometimes what seem to be the most penetrating kinds of points about the sort of things that we take for granted .",0

"The reality of Citrine 's position was somewhat less dramatic than was sometimes imagined by contemporaries . It is true that he knew the Prime Ministers of the later 1940s and early 1950s , Attlee and Churchill , personally , and he was not averse to breaking protocol by raising policy matters with them behind the back of their Minister of Fuel and Power on a few occasions . These occasions bore no fruit , however , and the effectiveness of his power really depended more on the skilled team he had behind him — with Sir Henry Self coordinating their relations with Whitehall from his own intimate knowledge as an ex - mandarin — and on the strength of the pressure of argument which they maintained . Citrine — sometimes with Self and Area Board chairmen , sometimes with other nationalised industries ' chairmen and sometimes alone — had irregular unminuted meetings with the Minister of Fuel and Power ( and sometimes with other senior Ministers ) at which they hammered out compromises on the more difficult policy questions . Yet months could go by without such a meeting , and they were less regular than those of , for example , the National Coal Board chairman .",0
"Another feature of the Enterprise Initiative is the development of employer partnerships , to work on ‘ live projects’ . These projects involve students , individually or in groups , in work concerned with meeting a real need , identified by an outside employer . This offers students an opportunity to test their knowledge and skills in the real world , at the same time as offering employers the chance to get to grips with a problem or task that they might not have the time or resources to tackle . Perhaps your company has a project that could benefit from such a partnership — if so , our Enterprise Development Officer will be happy to discuss it with you .

"Slander is a defamatory statement made by word of mouth or by gesture . Plaintiffs may sue for libel even though they have suffered no financial loss but for slander ( with certain exceptions ) they must be able to prove actual damage and not mere injury to feelings . Historically , the distinction is explained by the view that writing was a premeditated and calculated act , which affected reputation much more drastically and permanently than off - the - cuff comments . With the advent of radio , television and satellite broadcasting , this reasoning is anachronistic , and Parliament has enacted that words spoken in theatres , and in broadcasts for general reception , shall be deemed libels and not slanders . The same provision is made for words spoken on a cable programme .",0
"It seems that those who try to live according to the official theory of schooling are subject to the same range of ritual abuse as the fans of another club . Perhaps those who live according to another theory of school see their rejection of the official line as contributing a dash of machismo to their public reputation . They certainly choose their abuse so as to indicate to those who do toe the line that they have lost it . But additionally , and given the enormous importance attached to the equilibration of dignity , not surprisingly , we find reference to a form of self - arbitration , where what they have said and done is judged by reference to their own conceptions of their integrity and dignity , regardless of ‘ popular’ opinion or the arbitration of specific others . G. H. Mead has suggested that there are two general stages in the development of the self ( Mead , 1934 ) .",0
"In criminal cases the accused was guilty until proved innocent . There were no juries or lawyers . Judges sat behind closed doors and took only written evidence , basing their decisions on the records of preliminary investigations conducted by the police .

"Unlike other large animal phyla all nematodes look alike except for size — at least to the common man . Their interest lies in the versatility of their design , their marvellous physiological adaptability and their ecological importance . In The Natural History of Nematodes it is unfortunate that George Poinar Jr does not throw off the armour of nomenclature which prevents the general student from getting to grips with these creatures . Modern Parasitology is an uneven book and needs a standard text to go with it according to the editor , T. E. G. Cox . The first two chapters are largely familiar but C. A. Arme 's on nutrition , the editor 's on immunity and R. M. Anderson 's on epidemiology are useful .",0
"This zone of farms is called the marginal fringe because it is at the upper margin for agriculture . With much cloud , mist and rain , and little sunshine , cereal crops seldom ripen and so the farmers avoid planting them . Also the grass grows for only a short - season , and the amount of hay which can be cut and dried varies from one year to the next . The income from lambs , a few older sheep and wool is hardly enough to pay the wages for a shepherd . Without a Government subsidy , based on the number of sheep , many of these farmers would go out of business .",1

"Failure of dialogue efforts The decision by the United States in December 1988 to open a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO)[see p. 36438]led to efforts by Israel in 1989 to persuade the administration of President Bush that the PLO Chairman , Yassir Arafat , was not sincere in his renunciation of terrorism , announced in Geneva on Dec. 14 , 1988 [ ibid . ] . However , after a second round of US - PLO talks in Tunis on March 22 , 1989 , the PLO leadership expressed fears that the USA lacked a specific programme for resolving the Palestinian issue , and was playing for time to secure a halt to the intifada ( "" uprising "" ) . Meetings were also held during the first half of 1989 between senior PLO officials and officials from France , Spain and the United Kingdom , culminating in Arafat 's talks with President Mitterrand of France in May 1989 , after which the PLO leader said that the PLO 's National Charter was "" obsolete "" and "" null and void "" [ see p. 36669 ] . On May 14 , 1989 , the Israeli Cabinet ratified Prime Minister Itzhak Shamir 's four - point peace plan [ see pp . 36599 ; 36670]which , as well as providing for elections among Palestinians in the occupied territories , called for international efforts to resettle over 1,000,000 Palestinians who were still classified as refugees .",0

"The inflated snobbery of purchasing a ritual traditionally reserved for those of a higher social rank did not appear until the very end of the eighteenth century ; conversely , it was a dissatisfied middle class which , towards the close of the nineteenth century , ushered in a less complicated and confusing street procession . The trade also regulated on the matter of pall - bearers ; usually six in number . In general , the rule of thumb was that one 's peers were seconded to perform the role . A married man 's pall was expected to be supported by his married friends ; if single then bachelor colleagues would perform the duty ; likewise for spinsters — but not so for children ( except in certain rural areas ) , married women or widows , when the responsibility was delegated either to adult male relatives of the deceased or the undertaker 's own men . In the country it was the custom for the estate workers or tenants to act as both coffin- and pall - bearers , this was a necessity as the local builder often doubled up as undertaker and would not have had so many men at his command as the full - time town undertaker .",0

"In contrast , the PNP enhancements for Phases 2 and 3 were 96.5 and 92 ( full - time equivalents ) , producing an average enhancement per school of 1.7 in Phase 2 and 0.9 in Phase 3 . The disparity between PNP phases was accentuated by two factors . One was that in many Phase 3 schools with fewer than 150 pupils on roll the allocation was only 0.5 , giving them a much smaller range of support and development possibilities than was open to those schools with a full - time enhancement . The second was the level of seniority at which appointments were made . The 1985–6 Phase 1 initial staffing profile shows a balance of senior and junior appointees — 53 coordinators and 60 Scale 1 teachers .",1

"Increased efficiency is one of the major objectives of the White Paper Working for patients ( DH , 1989a ) . The document proposes a number of efficiency promoting measures , including the establishment of an ‘ internal market’ for health services with contracts between ‘ purchasers’and ‘ providers’ , a voluntary scheme for those general practices that wish to manage their own budget and indicative drug budgets for all general practitioners . Since the pursuit of increased efficiency is one of the major objectives of the proposals , this begs the question of how efficiency will be assessed . Another chapter in this volume ( Mullen , 1990 ) points out that the functioning of the internal market in health care is not a simple matter . One can not necessarily assume that the operation of market principles per se will automatically lead to efficiency .",0

Praise is a hugely powerful management tool particularly when selectively employed and linked to great expectations . Your school may well have school rules and even a discipline policy but do you have a policy for catching children being good ? As a rough rule of thumb there seems to be a ratio of 90 per cent teacher comment of the ‘ do n't do’ and ‘ stop it’variety to 10 per cent praise . If we placed as much effort into making a fuss of children when they are good as we do when they are naughty we might make even greater gains . Not that I 'm suggesting that we should be soft when children do wrong but that we just reverse the ratio of our attention and energy from the negative to the positive .,0
"The testing arrangements : The national curriculum will be intimately connected to the assessment and testing schedule at years seven , 11 , 14 and 16 and the same concerns expressed in 3 a and b apply . The programmes of study will apply from five years of age , likewise the attainment targets , although not in operation formally until the age of seven years , will of course be drawn from the study programmes in the first two years of statutory schooling . The concept of ‘ teaching by objectives’ , and regular progress monitoring , can be regarded as offering a system whereby no child slips through the net . But the concern , in respect of the early years , is that we have never achieved consensus over what an appropriate early years curriculum should be ; besides which , provision is so varied nationally that some children are evidently disadvantaged from an early age . In his evidence to the Select Committee on Under - Fives , the Secretary of State for Education , Kenneth Baker , said he appreciated the different starting points ( into education ) and said that schools could publish in their results a clear indication of the starting age of children in order to indicate those who are disadvantaged ( unpublished evidence ) .",0

"In 1947 he had formed the English Opera Group , which performed his works . Securing an audition for The Turn of the Screw , Michael Ingram recited a poem and sang ‘ Early One Morning’ . In competition with 800 other boys , he made it to the last five , but nerves got the better of him during a final audition at the Criterion Theatre , in London 's West End . The role went to David Hemmings , who was to become a film star and , later , a director . When , six months later , the English Opera Group was looking for a boy soprano to play the Little Sweep in a new production of Let 's Make an Opera — in which the young Michael Ingram had previously treated a Brixton audience to on - stage nudity — Benjamin Britten remembered Michael , not so much for his singing , but for the havoc he caused at the earlier auditions .",0

"When considering a whole range of variables it is found that those social characteristics indicative of a low position of wealth or status do not appear among persons treated as criminal more often than one would expect from their proportion among the general population .

It may be that the Sri Lankan system of crime control was more fair than most others , that it did not discriminate against those least able to defend themselves , and that the ‘ real’ profile of Sri Lankan lawbreakers was not much different from those of other societies . It could even be argued that in the special circumstances of colonialism the judicial system was biased against mainstream groups in order to increase the state 's control over them , and that in fact the poor and marginal , as in all societies , committed most crime .",0

The Council is , thanks to the SEA , more than ever the true ‘ Parliament’ of the European Community in that it — rather than the Strasbourg assembly — passes the Community 's laws and does so , moreover , behind closed doors in ways which would not be tolerated in any individual national member state . Where does the Government stand on this ? Will UK ministers now demand that when the Council meets to legislate its sessions are open to public and Parliamentarians alike ?",0
"By JIM WHITE GENERAL TIPS A general rule for pub rock patrons is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer ( except at Finsbury Park 's Sir George Robey where an excellent music policy comes complete with a decent pint of Guinness ) . Another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage , it will be a good evening . There are two types of pub rock occasions : those , like the one described above , where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia ; and those where the pub is so crowded , death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out . There is no half - way house .",0
"To help her , she is allowed to ask three people to turn round , which they do as far as possible without revealing whether or not they have the ball .

Make sure that the smaller children get a turn and , if one person is continually doing the catching , they can then pass it to one of the younger ones . 75 Kickit cricket",1
"If you press even one or two types of flower you could possibly decorate a photograph of your holiday with a pressed flower mount ( see pp . 136–7 ) . I felt that the design for this holiday picture should be a natural and less structured design than normal , so I laid out the pressed stems of eucalyptus which naturally fell into a fan shape and used that as the basis of my design . Many other themes came to mind when I started thinking about holiday pictures . For example , you could use some locally made fabric as a background , or if you spent a lot of time of the beach , you could press some seaweed and later incorporate it into the picture . Seaweed presses beautifully , but needs a slightly different technique , so take it back to your hotel or villa and deal with it in the bathroom !",0

For instance , when Oliver Reed made his now famous appearance with slightly more than a little Dutch courage inside him , he suddenly took it into his head that he wanted to sing .

"The male milt , or sperm - bearing fluid , is distributed over the eggs which are then , hopefully fertilized . Once this has happened , it is advisable to remove some of the plant material covered in spawn away from the preying adults ( who will promptly eat most of it if there is only sparse plant cover in the pool ) . It can be placed in an aquarium with pond water until the young fry are large enough to survive the rough - and - tumble of the garden pool . It is important , though , to use pond water in the aquarium , for this will then be of the same temperature and composition , and therefore not injurious to the spawn . After three or four days the fry will be seen developing .",0

"But in any case , the best proof of the pudding is in the eating — by which I mean that any one who has tried to help young poets over the years , whether in Britain or America , knows that Ford 's and the imagists ' precepts about diction are what most of them most need to learn — no novelty , after all , since they can learn the same lessons from the preface to Lyrical Ballads , if they choose to . What they learn in such a case is , of course , only a rule of thumb ; for if criticism sometimes has to be prescriptive , its prescriptions are never applicable except ' by and large ' . Rules of thumb are the only rules there are , in the atelier . But experience has taught me that this is the rule of thumb that can be most profitably proposed and acted upon . I dare to go further : some of the most gifted and earnest among my contemporaries — I think of Edgar Dowers in the United States and Geoffrey Hill in the United Kingdom ( though I except Hill 's wonderful Mercian Hymns ) — fall short of pleasing me as they might , because they seem not to have followed this rule of thumb , and their language is habitually for my taste a shade , or several shades , too grandiloquent or ' literary ' .",0

"And at one time it was UK policy for fertiliser use to be encouraged by direct grants and subsidies .

( Asking if the ‘ government’ should pay of course begs the question , where does the government get the cash from if not from the consumer ? In practice , as we have seen , it is British policy to subsidise the polluting farmers rather than make them pay to clean up the pollution . ) The precautionary principle suggests that , as the future damage done by pollution is often more costly than the extra expense of avoiding it in the first place and in any case it is often unacceptable , even if a money cost ca n't be put on it , then prevention is better than cure .",0

Banks too are muscling in on insurance , mainly on the life side , to keep customers ' savings ' in the family ' .",0
"This is the practice that has been followed for many years and by and large it has worked . However , recent legislation suggests that such a simplistic approach by the librarian is no longer tenable or advisable even when the publication is neither obscene nor indecent .

"She laughed and cried . ' I do n't believe it ! ' she said . She began to talk rapturously , pouring out speculations about the future , all mixed in with details of her life — which she claimed was deeply unhappy , under a permanent cloud because her mother had died giving birth to her .

"Council worker suspended over ‘ jobs for the boys’ claim By Susan Dean A STRATHCLYDE regional councillor has been suspended from his job as a caretaker with Monklands District Council for his claims that he has proof to back up ‘ jobs for the boys’ allegations . John Murphy , Labour regional member for Coatbridge North and Glenboig , was suspended on full pay yesterday after a meeting with officials of the housing department , including the depute director , James McCarrell . The move , pending a full disciplinary hearing , follows Mr Murphy 's claims to The Scotsman earlier this month that he has evidence to support claims that there have been cases of patronage to ensure that certain jobs in the local authority went to Labour Party members .",0
"This does not effect the quality of the stored image file , but if you require an on screen display of the final image , a SVGA card displaying 256 colours will be needed .

"This may well have had a bearing on Washington 's decision later in the year to send out the hostage intelligence team , headed by Major Charles McKee of the DIA , who died in the bombing of Flight 103 . Indeed , the loss of the Asmar network 's continuing surveillance of NARCOG 's operations in Lebanon may well have had a bearing on the bombing itself . After my warnings and reports , and then Tony 's murder,[says Coleman]I assumed that somebody would have the CIA on the carpet and close NARCOG down . After all , the US had just lost one of its most valuable assets in the Middle East .

"Paul Merson was close to stunning Old Trafford in the 80th minute with a stupendous 35-yard volley which took goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel unawares , but smacked hard against his crossbar . Ferguson insists his men have not lost their nerve but even the United manager concedes that his confidence is not shared in the stands , and that the fans ' apprehension can seep into his players ' hearts . That was the danger as Arsenal , chasing success on two cup fronts but arriving on a roll of four straight wins and reinforced by the returns of Ian Wright , Lee Dixon and John Jensen , massed behind the ball and waited to pounce on the break . United were on a diet of scraps — Gary Pallister 's low driven free kick deflected wide , a free header for Steve Bruce not fully exploited , Mark Hughes denied by David Seaman 's reflexes and then shooting wide . Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe were subdued out wide , Brian McClair and Paul Ince having to battle for midfield domination .",0

"But , thanks to a combination of high interest rates on traditional deposit accounts over much of this period , coupled to a distinct lack of publicity for SAYE , it has been relegated to little more than a footnote in the long list of savings options . However , according to the Halifax Building Society , there has been a major surge in interest for SAYE of late , thanks to low interest rates . In a nutshell , SAYE is a regular savings scheme offered by just a few building societies which can be opened by anyone aged 16 or over . The rate of interest , in the shape of a tax - free bonus , is set by the Treasury .

"That is why , as examples , the Films Group and ICI Advanced Materials are outside C&P and not part of its plastics business . Lindsell agrees that C&P 's 11 businesses [ see separate list overleaf]are in several cases mature and that assessment of their future growth potential has to take account of this . But he emphasizes very strongly that in no way does this mean that there is no longer scope for their further development , or that their return to profitability is a flash in the pan , to be reversed whenever the next downturn comes . Certainly , trading conditions over the past 18 months have been very buoyant . However , the sheer size and mix of activities in C&P give it ‘ swings and roundabouts’ protection against the ups and downs of the economic cycle .",0
"In other areas too , it seems that the case for Woodchester as the final pavement of a sequence of elaborations "" cuts with a double - edged blade "" : at the beginning of the sequence , for example , it is difficult to understand how a twenty - five year long period of development had no other local influence . It seems that the case for elaboration , and thus for the Withington - Barton Farm - Woodchester order of development , must stand or fall on the implications of the stylistic inter - relationships of the pavements themselves . There is insufficient evidence to include the Newton St. Loe pavement within this group ; it begs the question , therefore , to describe it as the example upon which subsequent pavements were based . In turn , this seriously questions the position of the Withington mosaic as a mosaic of the late - third century ( other mosaics in the area of Withington , e.g. Chedworth , Spoonley Wood , Whittington Court and Stonesfield , are almost certainly well into the fourth century ) , and precursory to that at Barton Farm . A different principle of development — indeed , a reversal of the principle of increasing elaboration — seems more probable .",0

"INTRODUCTION This book covers the legal aspects of buying a business by acquiring its assets and undertaking rather than by acquiring the shares of the company that operates the target business . It is a guide for practitioners and does not attempt to expound academic points which are better dealt with by numerous text books .

However , the points covered are also relevant for sales by sole traders and by partnerships .",1

"Karriers produced a similar coupling and did good business through this with many transport firms . The complete unit or coupling was manufactured within the works from design to smithing , machining , assembly to the fitting on the vehicles . Many were the types of trailer bodies manufactured for these motor tugs to haul : special flats , cattle trucks , high and low sided types , open and covered , sliding roofed etc . In the first instance the trailers were converted in true Wolverton style from horse - drawn vehicles , but with the exception of the experimental models , there was nothing primitive about the conversion . These trailers were fitted with pneumatic type wheels and proper cable - operated brakes in drums .",1
"We 'll wait , then we 'll go , one step at a time.’ Kit Everard was not a vain man , and he knew that even in the encounters that had given Ariel some pleasure ( later , when he 'd learned to check his premature excitement with her ) , she had not cared for him with her heart . He thought she might not have a heart , or tried to explain away her indifference by imagining she were made of obsidian through and through . He needed to think that he had been well - intentioned , but her consent or inclination did not figure among the considerations with which he weighed the matter .

"In the low head the stressed syllable which begins the head is low in pitch ; usually it is lower than the beginning pitch of the tone on the tonic syllable .

"However , the modest additional resources granted to MDC to cope with its new challenges cast doubt on its ability to transform its single purpose agency practice . Clearly , if MDC does not possess the institutional resources to meet its new challenges it will not succeed . Equally , however , if they are essentially operating as traditional institutions and if it does succeed as a multi - purpose agency , it begs the question whether UDCs were necessary in the first place . MDC has clearly demonstrated a capacity to realise physical renewal of its initial area and has operated effectively as a single - purpose agency .

"On the day they want to , they will massacre you to the last man , and it is your duty to fall .

"From this rarefied environment of pure light and pattern , I would suddenly find myself winging across to Indonesia again , to join my brother for months of immersion in a different dimension of discovery . For years we had studiously avoided visiting the island of Bali on the quite false assumption that its international airport and beach hotels placed it beyond our professional interest . But when curiosity got the better of us we found ourselves almost immediately drawn to a highland community where , like a long - awaiting gift , we were invited to build a house for about a thousand pounds on a verdant piece of property . Far from the tourist beaches , this idyllically simple three - storey home would serve as a sort of Base Camp One for our more ambitious sorties into the extremities of the nation . The differences between living in my Hollywood A - frame and in our Balinese house required an organism - crunching transition , which in many ways parallels the fundamental complementary opposites between East and West .",0

"We hear her first on these records in 1914 : just two items — the voice sharply etched — on Pathé , made in the year of her British début , when at London 's Drury Lane under Beecham she created no great impression as Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier . The main sequence of recordings began in 1916 as did her spectacular career in Vienna . Then , with some breaks ( nothing from 1918 , 1922 and 1923 ) , we go through to 1924 , when at Covent Garden she sang her first Marschallin on stage , making history and her house début at the same time . She was then 36 . In fact , the set should probably be called ‘ The Vocal Prime of Lotte Lehmann’ .",0
"But then the Low Countries were prone to the occasional architectural brainstorm , such as the remarkable Saint - Pierre Station , Ghent ( 1912 ) . It is an Oriental mirage , a full - blown castellated and minareted North African Bey 's palace . Surmounted by a slender clock - tower , which summoned the Belgian bourgeoisie to rendezvous with the trains as surely as any muezzin summoning the faithful to prayer , it looks for all the world as if it has been transported by some mischievous jinn on a magic carpet . But it can perhaps be seen as an architectural expression of that scented fin de siècle fascination with the Near East that produced in this period such works as Massenet 's opera Thaïs and Strauss 's Salome and the luxuriant novels of Pierre Loti and Pierre Louys . However , many of the new stations began to feature a strongly marked nationalism as the assertive spirits of rival nations jostled with each other and advanced their claims for continental dominance with increasing stridency .",1

The first step in the evaluation of the ANLT processing system was to select a few sentences from the Longman / Lancaster corpus and samples of recognised text ( the HP business text in Appendix 5 and estate agents details ) . Each test sentence used is therefore a valid member of the English language ( although it may not necessarily conform to prescriptive syntactic rules ) . Some general rules of thumb were used in the selection of test sentences . Firstly there should be no punctuation ( beyond sentence terminators ) due to the acknowledged failure of the ANLT to process such phenomena . Simpler sentence forms were preferred and no sentence containing more than 18 words was used .,0
"In a lower alcohol product , the alcohol content is reduced significantly from the standard level but some alcohol is retained to keep the product more authentic to its original taste . At present , there is no legal limit to the amount of alcohol allowed in a beverage describing itself as "" Low Alcohol "" . As a rule of thumb , however , most lower alcohol Beers and Ciders are under 1.2 % alcohol by volume and most of the other lower alcohol beverages which Tesco stocks are less than 3.5 % vol . The alcohol content is clearly stated on the front of the label . The three most common methods to reduce the alcohol in a wine or beer are ARRESTED FERMENTATION , DILUTION and a special method called REVERSE OSMOSIS .",0
"This shop was still open , but Boy stayed outside , looking at the window display . In the top right - hand corner of the window was a single magazine whose cover displayed a naked man instead of a naked woman or a smiling mother . Boy stood outside the window and imagined the things he might see inside this magazine , should he ever take it down off the high shelf and open it , perhaps in the privacy of his room or perhaps right there on the street at five o'clock . He imagined small , cheaply staged pictures of sexual tortures involving ropes and wires — the kind of things which Boy had not yet done . He imagined a full - page , black and white photo of two barechested men ( their chests shaved ) , photographed in daylight , walking down the street , gazing squarely at the camera , holding hands , one of them holding an alsatian straining at a leather leash .",1
"However backward in some respects , its educational level was high , and it was certainly better adapted in 1880 to the demands and discipline of industrial life than the population of any other part of the world except North America . Such human resources were soon to be available elsewhere — notably in Japan — but for some decades they guaranteed to Europe and North America a monopoly of technical invention and discovery . Not one important industrial process was produced by Asia or Africa during the period covered by this book . Almost as important as her mineral and human resources , was Europe 's physical position . A long , indented coastline , with many harbours on both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean , gave her easy access to the oceans and had made her the economic centre of the world .",1

"The placing of Uruguay and Colombia in the third pool has satisfied the South Americans , and what used to be called the Iron Curtain countries can not complain . All that remains now is for the draw , which will be made in the Rome Sports Palace late this afternoon , to avoid such minor irritations as Holland joining England in Sardinia , thereby doubling the security problem ; Scotland renewing hostilities with Uruguay , whom they have refused to meet in friendlies since the 1986 World Cup ; and Austria playing West Germany , which would revive memories of the cynical conspiracy in 1982 which froze Algeria out of the second phase . Rest assured that whatever happens the proceedings will be above board . ‘ Innocent fans,’ said Sepp Blatter , the general secretary of Fifa , would be making the draw from an assortment of pots . Luciano Pavarotti will be there to strike the right note for an occasion of speeches , publicity films and general hype that is costing £ 1 million and will be seen by a worldwide television audience of 500 million .",0

"At home Keith is a naughty boy and frequently has breath holding tantrums to which his parents have responded by smacking and shouting at him . On one occasion they locked him in a bedroom and he threw a wooden brick through the window and tore down the curtains .

His tempers at nighttime disturb Amy and also earn bangs on the wall from the irritated but otherwise kindly , elderly couple next door .

"The names of certain prison governors whose personal positive qualities permeated every aspect of their prisons tend to be long remembered .

While it is not suggested that this roll of honour is exhaustive , a list would , even on a world - wide basis , be strikingly short . It is notable that in the prisons featured in this book , the head of prison emerges , if at all , as an anonymous official .",0

"Cameroun and South Korea are the teams to avoid from the fourth pool . Certainly England will not complain if they are confronted with Costa Rica , and 1950 is a sufficiently dim memory now not to have bad vibes about the United States . Yesterday 's proceedings were not entirely cut and dried . The organising committee took four hours to announce the seedings and draw order , much of the time being taken up trying to persuade West Germany , who had assumed they were going to Verona , to switch to Milan at the last moment . The problem stemmed from Turin 's — and therefore Fiat 's — demand for an attractive seed to grace the city 's new stadium .",0
"He emphasised that there was no guaranteed success in the professional world just because a player had been a top amateur . Following the sun playing golf and collecting cheques sounds attractive . The reality is harsher ; raising sponsorship ; overall cost of travel ; making ends meet by living in a caravan instead of luxury hotels ; endless pressure ; missed putts ; loss of income . Even for those who succeed , it can be a long , even hungry trail . Erskine 's advice is still true .",0
"Or perhaps the plot of a story like this demands such heroism from Jacob , never mind the unheroic qualities he has displayed before . Certainly when Jacob appears to have his assailant in his power , it is precisely what we would expect . The ‘ man’ , unable to get the better of Jacob , touches his thigh and puts his hip out of joint . It is dark magic , such as a hostile demon might well display . Yet still Jacob has him in his grip , and the mysterious assailant begs him to let him go ‘ for the day is breaking’ .",0
"An indication of this has been the reduction in the activities of the rural underworld , which was such a thriving feature of village life when it was an occupational community , but which has now virtually disappeared . Those indulging in poaching activities today are well - organized wide - boys from nearby towns , with the use of large vans and with good contacts in the meat trade . The farm worker is as likely as not to be found standing shoulder to shoulder with his employer defending the farm and its game — a literal case of poacher turned gamekeeper . Because of the ways in which the changes wrought by urbanization have worked their way through the village community the contrast between the more affluent life - styles of the newcomers and the poorer living standards of local farm workers have not therefore resulted in greater conflict between farmers and their employees . If anything , farm workers now identify more with farmers than they have in the past .",1

"The vivarium and aquarium soon followed , with parallel changes in fashion . Changing fashions in popular natural history did not affect those who were doing research in botany and zoology directly , except through the demand for books . But indirectly the growing public awareness of science and its potential shaped the professionals ' world by exposing it to the rough and tumble of political life . ‘ Big science’ on the model provided by Paris required funds that were only likely to be provided by governments , and some governments were more willing than others to get involved . Where there was reluctance — as in Britain — middle - class pressure had to be brought to bear in order to convince the politicians that something ought to be done .",0

"Stage of problem development . Primary prevention is normally understood in terms of universal needs and services : sufficient income , adequate housing , appropriate health care . Parker ( 1980 ) associates primary prevention with efforts to prevent problems from ever arising which begs questions regarding the nature of the problems under review . In social work these can be defined as difficulties in personal and social functioning . However , since personal and social difficulties are experienced by most people , the problems addressed in primary prevention in social work also include those complex processes whereby individuals become separated out from the general population , entering client careers with welfare agencies ( Greenley and Kirk , 1973 ; Hardiker and Barker , 1985 ) .",0

He had worked at the idea with all the intensity of youth , and now it was about to bear fruit . The book was , apparently , the kind of tale for which all young people had been waiting and its heavy sales in the United States had amazed him ; the first hardcover edition had sold fast enough to surprise even his capable publisher .

"In August 1988 both sides had agreed in principle to a UN peace plan calling for a ceasefire and exchange of prisoners and to a referendum designed to give the inhabitants of the territory ( administered as a Spanish colony until 1976 ) a choice between independence or integration into Morocco . On June 27 , 1990 , the UN Security Council had approved preliminary plans to establish a UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara ( MINURSO ) to monitor a ceasefire and the referendum . A delegation of 38 Saharan tribal elders ( 19 from Layoun under Moroccan control and 19 from Tindouf under Polisario control ) had met in Geneva on June 4 and had broadly agreed that 74,000 people listed on the census rolls drawn up by Spain for the referendum of 1974 would be eligible to vote . However , the Polisario officials estimated that the Saharan population had swelled to 207,000 by 1987 , of whom nearly two - thirds were in refugee camps in Algeria . The two sides disagreed on whether 100,000 Moroccan soldiers and thousands of Moroccan administrators should remain in the region during the referendum , the Polisario officials insisting that they be withdrawn beforehand , while Morocco offered to confine them to their garrisons .",1

"The nearest thing to a Zemsky sobor summoned by Peter 's successors was Catherine II 's Legislative Commission ( 1766–68 ) . It helped make the government conscious of some of the preoccupations of nobility and townsmen , but when its proceedings were interrupted by the Turkish War , Catherine allowed the experiment to lapse . Nor did any of the projects for constitutional constraints upon the Tsar 's discretion bear fruit . The only major attempt to impose terms on the Crown was made in 1730 , when Peter 's daughter Anne was offered the throne . The Supreme Privy Council , established during the reign of Peter 's widow Catherine I ( 1725–27 ) , sought to establish the right to participation in , and an effective veto over , all major policy decisions .",0

There is in fact a fine line in Hunt 's book in which he describes his reaction , on getting to Austria — Niki 's home circuit — and learning that Niki was a very sick man indeed . James says simply that ' it was suddenly very important to me that he should live ' .",0
"The majority of the buildings were of post - hole or trench construction and display considerable variation in size and design ( Figure 2.5 ) . The walls of the buildings most commonly consisted of a single row of vertical timber planks or baulks with wattle panels inserted into grooves down their edges . Alternatively , pairs of vertical timbers in holes in the ground clasped horizontal members with wattle and daub infilling , or the uprights were staggered with panels of inter - woven wattles between them . The interpretation of the super - structures naturally presents greater problems , but it is argued that most had gabled roofs with rafters resting on wall plates below head height . The floor would be clear with crucks across the middle of most of the buildings supporting purlins and a ridge - piece .",1
"BERKELEY – Across the Euro - Atlantic world , recovery from the recession of 2008 - 2009 remains sluggish and halting , turning what was readily curable cyclical unemployment into structural unemployment . And what was a brief hiccup in the process of capital accumulation has turned into a prolonged investment shortfall , which means a lower capital stock and a lower level of real GDP not just today , while the recovery is incomplete , but possibly for decades . One legacy of Western ~ Europe ’s experience in the 1980s is a rule of thumb : each year that lower labor - force attachment and reduced capital stock as a result of declining investment depresses production $ 100~billion below normal implies that productive potential at full employment in future years will be $ 10~billion below what would otherwise have been forecast . The fiscal implications of this are striking . Suppose that the United ~ States or the Western European core economies boost their government purchases for next year by $ 100~billion .",0

He predicts that computers of the future will process knowledge , not numbers , using symbolic inferences , as in the familiar syllogism : all birds can fly ; budgie is a bird ; then budgie can fly . A small step has been made in that direction .",0

"Readers are left to judge for themselves who did more for the Javanese people . Barley is exceedingly delicate in his treatment of the great Bung Karno , the man who once stated , to wild applause from an audience of Indonesian economists , that ‘ Inflation can be good — as long as it is inflation for the Indonesian revolution’ . Delicacy is essential , for the Javanese are still touchy and Sukarno , though under a cloud , is still perceived as a great national hero . Sukarno 's repressive nationalist regime led directly to the massacre of perhaps a million of his communist supporters , gross civil rights abuses , torture , the illegal invasion of East Timor , and the current police state . Raffles abolished torture and slavery , restricted the powers of the rajas and landowners , and spent his own money buying land for a Javanese botanical garden .",0
"Clearly , the homes and household objects that people adopt for purposes of personal and social identity frequently change their nature . Once an elite has established itself , it may well find itself being emulated or used as a reference group by ' lower ' social classes . On the other hand , rapidly emerging elites often pride themselves as ahead - of - the - game , a kind of cultural avant - garde . As Laumann and House suggest , they can usually be depended on to adopt design - languages distinguishing themselves from those who have not yet arrived .

"Communications were also a nightmare for first soldiers in Ulster — their primitive radio sets were a disaster in built - up areas .

"For some of us it 's pitting our strength against the elements , for others it 's pitting our wits against other people by going racing and yet other people seek adventure by exploring new sailing areas and the beauty of a small sail boat like the Topper is that you can do all of these . In tidal waters like the Channel Islands , you must find out what the tides are doing . That means looking up the tide tables to see the times of high and low water and the tidal stream list to find the maximum rates . In tide free waters like the Mediterranean we do n't have the same problem but we still need to consult a chart to find out a suitable location for sailing . That may be affected by the prevailing wind and we 'll have to find a suitable launching site .",1

He also found it unacceptable that ‘ although this has not been set down in black and white , the West is clearly inclined to have the conference discuss the regime existing in Afghanistan , and the character of Soviet - Afghan relations’ . Bovin believed that in place of such a conference ‘ Afghanistan should conduct direct negotiations with its neighbours , above all with Iran and Pakistan’ . Soviet leaders had been prepared to consider international arrangements and guarantees only on the external aspects of the Afghan problem .",0
The roads were not strong enough . Tests by the American Association of State Highway Officials in the early 1960s are the basis for calculating the damage to roads . The rule - of - thumb ' law ' that emerged from these tests was that road damage varied with the fourth power of the axle load . Thus a 10 per cent increase in axle weight would increase road damage by nearly a half . And the damage inflicted by one lorry axle weighing 10 tonnes is 160 000 times that of a car axle .,0
"Sea Rover 's Captain and crew were jailed in Holland after two years of cat and mouse games with the Customs of several nations .

Fortunately , many of these loopholes are now being closed by new amendments and , hopefully , there will be less frustration for the law - enforcers who , in the past , have seen many villains slip through the net after they have worked hard to bring them to justice .

"However , when it is thought that attitudinism renders ethics irrational , the usual point is that ethical conclusions can not be inferred in any rational manner from premisses which are purely factual . That means that they can not be supported , or more importantly tested , by observation . However much you pile up facts about the world in order to support an ethical case , you can not get an ethical conclusion unless you take some ethical premiss for granted , in a way which usually just begs the question against those with whom you disagree . Thus if people are trying to decide whether the use of human foetuses for experimentation , and perhaps their deliberate production for this purpose , is morally acceptable , no amount of factual knowledge will settle the matter of itself . ( ’ Metaphysical ' facts about the presence of a soul would be equally incapable of closing the matter ethically . )",0

"It received a new boost in 1990 when John Gribbin and Martin Rees published their The Stuff of the Universe , where it was asserted that the universe came into existence solely in order to create a carbon - based intelligent life - form on just one planet — Earth . This is because the conditions needed for the Big Bang had to be so finely tuned — to an amazing one part in 10&sup60;(a big number even on a cosmic scale ) — that the most minute variations would not have permitted any life at all to develop . And according to physicist Tony Roth the Principle could well be true because many earlier broad cosmological theories have paved the way for later testable discoveries , as has the Copernican Principle , and even the Principle of Beauty which bore great fruit in the theory of electroweak interaction , which recently united the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces . In any event , the theory of environmental selection by variant genotypes within an evolving species is quite common in biology . There are , incidentally , several opposing theories to the Anthropic Principle .",0

"Take again "" Men exist "" , or rather its "" logically regimented "" paraphrase "" ( Ex ) x is a man , or perhaps "" ( Ex ) x is human "" . The main problem here is what to do with the existential quantifier . Now it is of course always possible to substitute ( x ) Fx for ( Ex ) Fx , replacing the existential quantifier , that is , with a universal quantifier plus negation , but there is nothing much to be gained by such a swap , for to paraphrase the proposition that something is human by saying that it is not the case that everything is non - human is merely to beg the question . Everything and something and nothing are all logically interlinked and none of them makes clear sense without the others . A rather more promising approach might be to treat the existential quantifier itself as a kind of predicate — a second - level predicate to be precise — which , in our example above , says something about the "" first - level "" predicate "" is human "" , namely that the latter can be completed to produce a true proposition .",0

"Clerks too tend to be travellers , temporary incomers to the towns where they study or just stay ; they are indigent , and they are shown in the fabliaux to supply their wants , in terms of food , sex and entertainment , by dint of their wits . A useful review of the clers of the Old French fabliaux by Phillipe Ménard ( 1983 ) indicates that to be a clerk is a matter of attitude and behaviour rather than simply an occupation . A pertinent statistical table produced by Nykrog shows how clerks are always successful in the eternal triangle of sexual competition , pitted against husbands ranging from knights to peasants . Through the clerkly sympathies of the fabliau corpus we can justifiably reach back to other forms of literature and literary theory associated with students and the universities and assess the fabliaux in that light . Several studies have been produced that point to correspondences between French fabliaux and intellectual ( scholarly ) currents of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries .",0

"It follows that a critical mass of teachers who see their job as not just delivering education but as re - creating it , in however small a way , is the absolute pre - condition for change that is purposeful and cumulative . It is my contention that entrenchment and cynicism both reflect and serve to heighten an atmosphere of demoralization ; that they arise as a result of a semi - conscious decision by teachers about how to cope with doubts and demands ; that while this stance often seems the only possible option it is a mistake to adopt it ; and that through insight into the dynamics of the decision - making process , a better stance can be found , even in very trying circumstances , that offers a greater opportunity for personal satisfaction and institutional success . This , in a nutshell , is the argument of this book . In the present climate it is not just a matter of professional duty to stay engaged with the possibility of change : it makes better sense .

The 6,020 square - metre terrace is capped by three unequal cones , admitting light to the areas below and symbolising the classic triad of the visual arts : architecture , painting and sculpture .",0
"Hence the comfort from eating , sucking sweets or a pipe , and drawing on a cigarette . Nicotine chewing gum helps in more than one way , I explained .

"Since marriage has an ' essentially heterosexual character ' , the criteria used to assess ' womanhood ' must , Ormrod J. asserts , be biological . For , he reasons , only a biological female ' is naturally capable of performing the essential role of a woman in marriage ' . Besides begging the whole question by using the word ' heterosexual ' , the tautology of this explanation is striking . All that Ormrod J. is in fact saying is that there has to be a woman in a marriage , because someone has to perform the essential role of a woman in the marriage , and this essential role is to be a woman , biologically so determined . This may be a valid conclusion .",0
"( Apr 21-May 21 ) In astrology , work and health are curiously linked are curiously linked — and for one reason or another , you are likely to feel under par , under pressure and totally misunderstood at the moment . In fact , you can argue and remonstrate until you are blue in the face but certain plans or arrangements can not be progressed just yet and you must simply sit tight and wait for the Full Moon in Aries on the 14th before making any drastic changes or decisions . Not a cheery little forecast you 'll agree — but remember you do n't have to stay in the jungle to be fair game . And another thing , you really ought to be venturing further afield ; travelling or doing something more challenging now and therefore perhaps you need a gentle prod to remind you that life is only , after all , what you make it . So what are you making of your life ?",0
"This is a witty , thoughtful , provocative film in which two women of colour exuberantly explore what it means to be black and beautiful . Then there was the world premiere of the latest film by Cone Serreau , France 's top - grossing director , due to her smash hit Trois hommes et un couffin , re - made as Three Men and a Baby . Her latest film Romuald et Juliette is about the extraordinary goings - on in a yoghurt manufacturing company which brings together the white boss and the Black night - cleaner who saves his bacon . This French comedy , bound to be controversial , depended on the very same stereotypes Serreau claims to be subverting .

"Robert Roberts also recorded the objections of working class parents in Manchester to the preliminary investigations regarding eligibility for free school meals , which were made by the school attendance officers , ‘ men of little education and known authoritarianism’ . Distrust of the expert was also a feature of middle class women 's attitudes towards the medical profession . In the case of working class women , intervention by primarily middle class volunteers or state officials often served to increase their burdens by exacting higher standards of childcare and housekeeping — what Anna Martin called holding the mother to her task of making bricks without straw — and punishing her if she failed . With school attendance , for example , it was the working class mother who was visited by the school attendance officer if her child failed to attend school , whether through inability to pay the school fee charged prior to 1891 , indiscipline , or because the child 's services were needed at home . In the late nineteenth century it was also the mother who attended the School Board ‘s hearing on the case and then , if necessary , appeared before the magistrate , despite the summons being invariably served on the father .",0
"Keiser ( 1978 ) reviews the selection and training of conference interpreters . He maintains that because of the highly complex activity , interpreters should be highly educated and already fluent . The basic examination should consist of:(a ) an interview with frequent switching from language to language;(b ) an improvised short speech in the first language on a topic chosen at random , to assess general knowledge;(c ) non - technical information in one language to be rendered consecutively in a second language;(d ) translation from a text off - the - cuff . These tasks are meant to be stressful and to show how well the student can use the languages in difficult circumstances . Unfortunately this constitutes only the assessment of a candidate 's suitability for entry to an interpreters ' qualifying course .",0

"The former argued that nothing less than overthrowing communism – “ regime - change ” in today ’s parlance – would do . The latter approach held that efforts to roll back Communism in the short run were too risky , given the Soviet nuclear arsenal , and that the United ~ States and the West should content themselves with limiting the spread of Soviet power and influence . Containment prevailed , but this hardly settled the debate , as there were intense arguments both over where it should be applied ( Vietnam , Central ~ America , and the Middle ~ East all come to mind ) and how it should be carried out , i.e. , the right mix of military force , covert action , diplomacy and arms control , and economic sanctions and assistance .

"Many tests develop a system of numerical scoring which makes it possible to make precise comparisons between the scores obtained by different individuals . This is done by taking the distribution of scores for children in the standardisation sample of a given age , and imposing on this a numerical scale which has clearly defined characteristics . The new scale will assign an arbitrary mean score to those children with average scores , and children performing above and below the mean will be assigned higher and lower scores on the new scale . Any new children in the original population ( from which the standardisation sample was selected ) can then be tested and , on the basis of their age and test performance , they can be given a test score which reflects their performance relative to the standardisation sample . This gives rise to a number of advantages for the teacher or therapist .",1

"In many areas , there were even more boundaries in the landscape than are used today , or were even apparent in the nineteenth century on tithe and other estate records . Desmond Bonney has been able to show this for the Enford area of Wiltshire , where the territory of each small settlement can be tentatively defined , even though most of their boundaries never emerge as more than tithing arrangements , if that . A similar case can be seen in Shrewton , where the identification of each separate vill within the estate begs the question as to the likely boundaries of each separate unit . Because so many of our boundaries are economic rather than administrative , it is most important that the patterns of settlement at different periods are identified and the likely land uses within them postulated . Only then will it be possible to suggest that much of the invisible ownership landscape is there in the form of landscape features and is of greater antiquity than has been formerly thought .",0

"Emecheta followed its success with Second - Class Citizen and The Bride Price but when her publishers , Allison and Busby , went broke , she decided to publish the hardbacks herself and sell on the paperback rights . It was very much a cottage industry : she and her two sons would drive around with books in the car , being their own distributors . Only now has she come in from the cold with her eleventh book being published by Collins ( at £ 10.95 ) . Writing has always been fitted in before other demands on her time — two hours in the morning before the children were awake when they were living at home . She took a BSc honours degree in Sociology at London University , worked as a community counsellor for one - parent families in Camden and was on the literature panel of the Arts Council until their decision to return to the Government some money designated for writers ' bursaries led her to resign in disgust .",0
"Human existence , for Marx and Engels , occurs in terms of people 's concepts , which are incorporated in their mode of life and their subjective experience , but it is from man 's interaction with nature and from the history of this interaction that these ideas , beliefs , and values are created in the first place . The argument runs like this : at any particular time people apprehend natural material circumstances through their ideas , and they therefore act in terms of these ideas , beliefs , and values . Therefore , in history it is not nature and technology which makes human society but it is man himself , who in terms of his already existing ideas and values , makes his own history , as he encounters nature and the problems it poses . These already existing ideas and values are , however , themselves the product of previous encounters and answers to the challenge of nature . This means that the relation of ideas and practical problems can only be understood as part of the process of history .",0

Mr Taylor , of Grantham , said Liam had gradually improved , and his voice choked with emotion as he described how the next afternoon his son had opened his eyes and reached for his teddy bear . At 5 am the next day , doctors had awoken Mr Taylor and his wife Joanne to tell them their son had had a heart attack and suffered severe brain damage . A decision had been taken to switch off his life - support machine . He had been christened that morning and died the same afternoon .",1

"An occasional shaft of sunlight penetrated the foliage and lit up the bronze trunks of the pines , touching them with fire . A grey squirrel , spry after its winter sleep , startled Ben by scampering across his path . It darted up a tree with breathtaking ease , and the young man watched it leaping from bough to bough , as light and airy as a puff of grey smoke . The primroses were out , starring the carpet of tawny dead leaves , and the bluebells , soon to spread their misty veil , now crouched in bud among their glossy leaves in tight pale knots . The faint but heady , perfume of a spring woodland was to stay with Ben for the rest of his life , and was connected , for ever , with a lover 's happiness .",1

"Not only has Simkin been unable to produce evidence of a family history of this genetic developmental disorder , but he has also failed to satisfy the essential diagnostic criteria . Simkin 's case rests on his proposed association of coprolalia , palilalia , and echolalia with alleged examples of facial and bodily motor tics , which occurred during Mozart 's adult life . However , with the solitary exception of Sophie Haibel 's mention of ‘ extraordinary grimaces with his mouth,’ which might qualify for a complex motor tic , Simkin then proceeds to deflate his argument by begging the question when he assigns inappropriately several examples of Mozart 's humorous hyperactivity to the category of motor ‘ Tourettisms.’ It must be emphasised that tics , the essential feature of Tourette 's syndrome , are ‘ involuntary , sudden , rapid , recurrent , nonrhythmic , stereotyped , motor movements or vocalizations’ which , though experienced as irresistible , can be suppressed for varying lengths of time . Neither the variability of Mozart 's facial expression , which portrayed his frequent alterations of mood , nor his compulsion to beat out , with repetitive movements of his hands and feet , the rhythm of the harmonies which continually filled his head , comply with the above definition of motor tics .",0

"But ultimately the test is whether the buyer could fairly and reasonably refuse to accept the physical goods proffered to him on the ground that their failure to correspond with what was said about them makes them goods of a different kind from those he had agreed to buy . The key to s13 is identification . ( pp503 - 4 ) The problem with this approach is that it begs the question concerning the nature of identification in unascertained future goods . Moreover , insofar as it suggests a commercial equivalence or de minimis rule , this would seem to be at variance with Lord Atkin 's approach in Arcos Ltd v EA Ronaasen and Son . In any case , the commercial context will often require strict compliance .",0

"Why ? Jealousy ? Or did Mr Lawson simply let his natural rudeness get the better of his judgment ? And the man is rude : in the same debate , he was questioned by John Townend , a Tory MP who , while not exactly Socrates in a suit , is a perfectly amiable cove .

"A second , of even greater significance , was closely associated with it . To its increased range , scholarship added new "" scientific "" method . Techniques that went back to the age of Aristotle and the scholars of Alexandria were married to contemporary nations , among then the idea , conceived in the time of Leibnitz , of a historiography based on the study of original documents ; and the marriage bore fruit . The ancient world , its texts and its history , were submitted to critical analysis with an unprecedented thoroughness , sense of system and concern for evidence that was , in intention at least , dispassionate and ( in spirit of Kant 's moral and aesthetic philosophy ) disinterested . Learning was superseded by research ; and if the work was pursued with the enthusiasm of a Winckelmann , that enthusiasm was not allowed to affect the outcome of the pursuit itself .",0
"Deterring Arab ~ Democracy CAMBRIDGE – The lack of democracy in the Arab world results from an unholy alliance between Western interests and local autocrats , justified by what both sides claim to be the region 's "" cultural specificity . "" In a nutshell , it has been much easier for the West to do business in the post - colonial Middle ~ East with un - democratic regimes , which have found Western support and recognition useful in marginalizing local liberal and democratic forces , even as it paved the way for the rise of Islamist radicalization . Sticks as well as carrots have been used – by both sides – to maintain this alliance . For example , the Western emphasis on reform and democracy in recent years has been used more often than not as a threat , a typical message being : "" Help us in Iraq or we will press for democracy and human ~ rights in your own country .",0

"According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , between 1982 and 1991 China earned in excess of $ 15 billion from exports of big weapons abroad . That does not include heaps of smaller arms and ammunition . The trouble with pushing the PLA into the arms business to makes ends meet is that other ministries , to their occasional embarrassment , have little control over which weapons are sold where .

Also worried are Taiwan and other neighbouring countries , which wonder what China will do when it has more of its own expensive new toys .",0
"This is best answered by asking what the desired goal is . Some may say that it is efficiency or effectiveness . But although these are attractive and apparently straightforward goals , they are , of course , only half an answer , since they beg the central question : efficient to what end , effective in producing what ?

So you sit down with The Hook and ask him about what it was like in the ' 60s in London , when he was lionised by Van Morrison , The Animals , Peter Green and all the gut - bucket R&B bands , but he just laughs and says it was fun . And you want to know what it was like being fêted by the Stones and Led Zep , and how in ‘ 61 Bob Dylan got his first Greenwich Village pro gig with John Lee ( and was apparently pissed off because the man from the New York Times was far more interested in rapping with the bluesman ) , but he just says it was nice to be able to put young Bob on the bandstand .",0
"I have also stressed that research is a powerful tool but like all sharp instruments can do harm as well as good if not properly used . What , then , can practitioners do to improve the situation ?

Clients may be fortunate that practitioners ' preferences match those suggested by research , but often this is palpably not the case . It seems irresponsible and morally indefensible to intervene in clients ' lives if you are uncertain about what can be achieved and the best methods of doing so .",0

"A final major application of graphical interchange is in the area of networked computer systems . Early computers were boxes with ports for terminals .

"Ingleborough is seen from Meregill Hole at close range and its appearance is daunting , steepening slopes topped by cliffs being a deterrent to intentions to reach the summit .

Others of iron resolution , having announced at breakfast their determination to climb Ingleborough that day , will have to save face by continuing the ascent . This they can most easily accomplish by following the wall between Sunset and Meregill upwards to the skyline depression to the left of the summit , a dull climb with no views other than those in retrospect until the ridge is reached and a turn to the right made to the top .

Of course , it is different if we intervene solely to restore the material condition of a work of art after it has been damaged by external forces such as an accident or vandalism . Since we have had to accept the loss of many works of art in the past , why not begin to humanise our relationship with contemporary creations ?",1

For this to work though , it was absolutely essential to get them to their spot a minute or two ahead of her , and to achieve that we had arranged for Mrs Thatcher to pause for a cup of coffee with the VIPs in a small room just outside the terminal door .

On one type the switch - off is automatic when water ceases to flow and the proportioner must be re - set before more chemical can be drawn again .

Both types are adjustable and can be calibrated to give the desired strength of solution by turning a small screw set in the housing next to the discharge orifice or by a hexagonal key slotted into a screw at the back of the device .

It was the final icing on the cake of the plan by many post - World ~ War ~ II leaders , driven by the memory of two horrible world wars originating in and consuming Europe in the previous half - century , to forge closer economic and political ties . Ten years ago , there were real concerns about launching the new currency . Would people give up their old national currencies and use the new euro ?",0

"' Wakey - wakey !

The team of three , led by Dr Peter Holmes , have just finished the last field work of a three - year study of the effect on invertebrates of different peatland management strategies across Wales . ‘ British insects have been so well recorded that the discovery of new species is the icing on the cake of the study,’ said Dr Holmes . About one or two new species of insect are found in Britain each year but Wales includes some of the least - studied habitats . The new species may be unique to Wales .",0
"After a splendid dinner on Friday evening most people managed to find the bar .

"E. Shipping merchants need the services of other forms of commerce , particularly insurance and banking . Central Liverpool has become a district with many offices and some of the insurance companies have grown to do general insurance business in all parts of the country . F. For seven years at the end of the last century thousands of navvies dug a canal 8.5 m deep for ocean ships to reach Manchester . The city became a major port as well as being the business centre for the cotton textile industry , with clothing factories and engineering works , especially those making textile machinery . Alongside the Manchester Ship Canal there were open spaces suitable for large modern factories using imported raw materials .",1
"For the designation of the state as ' a tool , is said to imply that it is an inert object which can be moulded and manipulated by the ruling class ; and this in turn is said to carry the misleading connotation that the ruling class has a ' will ' . These assumptions are criticised for having various unfortunate consequences ; but most of all , they belong to an approach which Poulantzas , following Althusser , labels ' historicist ' . Its distinguishing characteristics are first the view that a class is partly constituted by the perceptions of its members , and second the belief , held either tacitly or openly , that the passage of history is marked by the growth of class consciousness , until a point in the future when an enlightened proletariat will be able to grasp its real interests and make its own history . This , however , is said to be nothing more than a scantily concealed voluntarism . If we are to attribute to social classes the capacity to perceive their interests , we shall have to analyse this property .",1
"Active rest is better than passive rest , so , unless you have very bad blisters , I recommend walking , cycling or swimming , but the main thing is to get the blood circulating through the working muscles and removing the fatigue products . Once you feel like running and can do so without stiffness or pain , you can work gently back towards normal training , along the lines of the schedule . As a rule of thumb , the second week after the race should be only half your normal mileage , and the third week almost back to normal . several short runs will aid recuperation more than occasional longer ones . Training speeds and recovery times",0

' If Raine Spencer 's iron will and unswerving competence made her intolerant of others less efficient — in the words of one neighbour , the kind of woman who ' rubs up worthy souls the wrong way ' — does she deserve the epitaph of the woman who alienated the children , sold the family silver , was short with servants and decorated Althorp in poor taste ? In the past 13 years , when 250 historic houses and their estates have been sold off , Althorp has flourished . Even Raine 's critics acknowledge that , in doing what dirty work had to be done and attracting the odium that went with it , she has put her stepson in a strong position .",0
"Mr chair . Erm , I seem to find myself in this committee in a minority of one . It 's a little like listening to those debates in parliament where parliament vote themselves extra salaries and I feel very uncomfortable in this process , I thought I might be coming here this morning to disagree with my own group , or those members of them that do n't agree with me , perhaps joined with the conservatives in opposing this motion , but I find in fact that everybody is saying oh let 's put up the er , the heading , I feel very uncomfortable with this having spent six months in the budget review , criticising officers up hill and down dale every time that they exceeded their budget , having told them that either they balance their budget or that they came in next year with a budget with no more than a one and a half percent increase , or their successors would be doing it for us . I feel very uncomfortable therefore , to sit in a room full of members , sitting here proposing to add five percent to the limit for members allowances , simply because we 've been unable to control our own behaviour , and to come in within that , I think it 's a very poor example , and it 's an example that I 'm not prepared to set .

"It may have been at this time that the name Saladin began to mean something to him . After the sealing of the Treaty of Nonancourt it was time for Henry II to carry out the promise made at Winchester last September and deal with William and Vulgrin of Angoulême , Aimar of Limoges and the other defeated rebels . He sent Richard on ahead while he travelled south through Berry , where once again his eldest son was making heavy weather of the task assigned to him .

"Goebbels 's rousing ' total war ' speech on 18 February 1943 stirred the Party faithful again for a short time . But outside their ranks its reception was a mixed one ; some , in circles of the ' intelligentsia ' , reportedly labelled the speech a piece of ' theatre ' and a ' comedy'designed for those who had always screamed ' Ja'to everything . And what impact it had made was soon dissipated when it was realized that the ' total ' war was still only partial after all , and that the well - to - do and high - and - mighty were still able to avoid the burdens which fell on ordinary people . Some wits even suggested that the answer to the labour shortage which the ' total war ' measures were seeking to combat was to be found by closing down the Propaganda Ministry and combing out Party offices . By March and April morale in the Party had fallen again , and a wave of propaganda meetings aimed at reviving the post - Stalingrad gloom were practically a total failure .",0

"The family came originally from Northamptonshire , making the transition from small open - field farmers to professional men in the seventeenth century , and its association with the Anglican Church was already three generations old when James was born . After attending two preparatory schools , he was admitted as a scholar to Winchester College in 1752 . As he was only seventh on the Oxford roll in 1758 , his last year , his place at the sister foundation ( New College , Oxford ) was by no means assured . He was provisionally enrolled at Oriel College , Oxford , and it was not until 21 July 1759 that he was able to celebrate his acceptance by writing the first line of the diary : ' Made a Scholar of New - College ' . In 1763 he was ordained and graduated BA .",1

When walking the course , it is important to note how each fence strikes you on first impression because this is how the horse will see it . Some fences can be deceiving from a distance , so the horse must be given clear aids as to what to expect so he is not taken by surprise .",1

"Can we be more scientific in our risk assessment judgements ? asks Professor Richard Taffler Traditional financial analysis involves the calculation of a number of accounting ratios , which it is hoped represent key measures of a company 's performance .

"Not surprisingly it was the study of history that gave birth to the social sciences . Yet , despite the rapid growth of these more recent subjects , history retains its traditional importance in higher education , since its social , cultural , economic and political concerns provide us with an interdisciplinary approach to problems that includes the perspectives and many of the methods of the various social sciences , yet also seeks to establish a broader , overall assessment of the issues it examines . The diversity of skills it develops makes history graduates particularly attractive to employers who seek flexibility of mind rather than specialised expertise in a single discipline . This is the case in most spheres of public and private management and administration ( eg civil service , commerce and industry ) , just as it is in public relations , sales - promotion and the media .

"The ceremony of enthronement was simple enough .

"The difficuIty with this conception of services , however , is that , on closer inspection , it admits too many exceptions . It may be true for many services which are involved mainly with the transmission of information such as financial , legal and educational services , but for other services such as catering and food preparation , film production or computer services , I am not so sure . Nor is the case of information - based services so clear - cut , as most involve some form of tangible documentation , for example , off - the - shelf insurance policies , legal briefs , or even this text ! If we were to extend this line of reasoning , we would also have to consider the materiality of services such as hairdressing , advertising and repairs which , arguably , take a tangible form and benefit their customers for a period of time after production . True , a haircut can not be stored , transported or resold , but the example of advertising and repairs is open to debate .",0

Two percentages are shown in each case : one relates to first responses to the question ' Do you like … ? ' and the other to all responses . By asking the women what they liked or disliked about the task in question , and whether their attitude was reversed in any particular circumstances , I was able to get a more complete picture of their experience of each task , and also to learn something about the characteristics these different housework tasks are seen to possess . Of the six tasks , ironing is most disliked : three - quarters of the sample report a negative attitude . It is disliked because it is physically an exhausting activity ; more than any of the other tasks it consists of actions which have to be repeated time and time again with little variation .",0
"For a start , the weather was atrocious when they most needed to acclimatize , and in their first seven weeks they had only seventeen days of cricket . Finding decent practice facilities was a constant headache , leading to some crazy situations ; in St Vincent , for example , Ken Barrington , the assistant manager , hunted all over for a place for Boycott to practise , and eventually found a piece of flat ground near the airport which had ducks waddling around and a donkey at long leg . There was the cancellation of the second Test after the Guyanese government decided to deport Robin Jackman because of his South African connections ; and then came the real tragedy , when Ken Barrington had a heart attack and died during the third Test in Barbados . By the end of that Test they were two down with two to play , and it is difficult to think of any England tour where such a low point had been reached . Yet in the last two Tests they fought back well , with some help from the weather which few could have grudged them , to earn draws , several batsmen contributing excellent fighting innings .",1

"It lay along the lines of Layton 's understanding of the poetic function ‘ which exists somewhere between fact and imagination,’ as Eli Mandel said of him . Not pure fact , not meretricious research , which observes and ‘ tames’ the insightful - prophetic thrust ; not ‘ mere’imagination or mental excitement — but the fruitful intercourse between the two , in an artistic equilibrium . Leonard could be fastidious to the nth degree in completing his own work — he has always said that he works ‘ one word at a time,’ and can spend months , even years , in adding finesse to it ; he is nevertheless dismissive of anything approaching scholarly exactitude , still more so pedantry . It is not clear where this comes from . There is certainly an element which highly values the proprieties of artistic freedom : a work of art must be a work of free spirit , untrammelled by rules and regulations , wherein absolute consistency — or conformity of any sort — is out of place .",0

"Even this degree of recalcitrance put Henry in a difficulty . He could not afford to antagonize Anselm , but — with motives very similar to those which led Anselm to maintain the rights of his see as he had received them from his predecessors — he had no intention of abandoning any rights enjoyed by his father and brother . Henry 's only plan at this moment was to play for time . He did not press for an immediate renewal of Anselm 's homage ; and William Giffard stopped calling himself bishop of Winchester . It was agreed , with Anselm 's consent , to send messengers to Rome to discover whether the pope was inflexible : meanwhile Anselm was restored to his lands .",0
"Viewed as an ' independent robot ' , I am happy to admit that a particular area of my brain controls my digestive processes and ' I ' do not , but I certainly do not want to say that that brain area is ' aware'of those processes . Sloman prompts one to ask what it could be like to be an entity that controlled all existing ( presumably conscious ) human beings but had no access to what went on in their conscious minds at all , and of which , ex hypothesi , the humans themselves were not aware ? To use the argument brought forward against the related speculation of Block ( i.e. about the tiny homunculi ) , one might at the very least want to deny that the higher and lower consciousnesses could , in any sense , be the same consciousnesses , whether or not they could be said to be in a physical part — whole relationship . The supreme organizer picture set out above , whose sub - modules are controlled but themselves conscious ( though not of the control itself ) , is a well - known theological pattern and has been explored elsewhere in detail : a God who is omnipotent , conscious , but not omniscient in that he can look into human brains while being unable to see what they are thinking . Whatever the heady consequences of that ( and they have classically been found contradictory ) , Sloman 's explication does not tackle the question of why it is we are conscious of certain things at some times but not at others .",1

"Not least BARRY MOONCULT who went so ape - dropping crazy , he was spotted stumbling out of the party while it was in full swing armed with a stash of joke bombs , which despite being pretty harmless ( containing about as much genuine explosive as your average cap pistol ) make a loud enough bang to put the fear of God into the most ardent of atheists . Armed thus , and in the mood for , erm , fun , Mr Mooncult stormed down to Paris ' notorious Pigalle red light area and proceeded to lob his ‘ ammunition’ at puzzled transvestites .

"Within Protestantism a shift occurred — away from the exegetical principles of the Reformers themselves toward a more legalistic attitude . The respect in which this shift affected attitudes toward the Copernican system may not be immediately obvious because Luther and Calvin had both made disparaging remarks about the new astronomy . Whether Luther really referred to Copernicus as a fool has been doubted , but in an off - the - cuff dismissal he remembered that Joshua had told the sun , not the earth , to stand still . Superficially at least , Calvin was even more disparaging .

"Clinton Heylin , author of the latest biography , ‘ Dylan : Behind the Shades’ * , ranks amongst the most assiduous , having co - founded the Telegraph , a quarterly magazine devoted to the study of Dylan 's life and work , and written an extraordinarily detailed chronology of his hero 's life . Mr Heylin is not a graceful writer , but his thorough knowledge and his generous use of interviews makes this the fullest account of the star so far . Paul Williams 's thesis in ‘ Bob Dylan : Performing Artist’ * * is that the best — indeed the only — way of getting to grips with the importance of Dylan 's work is by treating it as performance art , since that is the way the man himself seems to treat it . The book has many keen insights into the nature of the Dylan achievements , but it is marred by a fault common to many who write about this man : idolatry . Mr Williams 's central argument can be tested by listening to ‘ Bob Dylan : The Bootleg Series’ * * , a set of five albums containing many rare and unreleased recordings from all periods of his career .",0

"( 262 ) In other words , Sartre 's attempt to combine Marxism with existentialist subjectivity can not resolve its difficulties through a shift from economism to history , for history implicitly continues to fulfil the same function anyway . Here Lévi - Strauss argues that behind the original question from which Sartre began — how can man make history if history makes him?— lurks another : if it is man who makes history , how does ‘ History’ gain its exorbitant status as the desired , unachievable object of Sartre 's text ? His emphasis on the primacy of history means that he forms ‘ an almost mystical conception of it’ . Sartre seems to have remembered only half of Marx 's and Freud 's combined lesson .",0

"In Walton 's view , there is a need to consider factors to be taken into account if the phrase is to be infused with greater meaning , and to clarify whether what is meant is the best interests of all children in a particular community , or of deprived , maladjusted or delinquent children , or of one particular child . Otherwise there is a danger that the phrase will be used merely symbolically , to create the illusion of change , to deflect criticism , or to discredit opposition ( because no one would want to be seen to oppose ' the child 's best interests ' ) . Walton stresses that there is no simple concept or criterion of the child 's best interests which can be applied in a crude rule - of - thumb way , and no group or individual which has sole authority to assume that generally it has the best conception of the child 's interests . Both schools of thought defined here , then , would claim to have as their central focus the child 's welfare , although it appears that the ' society - as - parent ' school more often uses this phrase or phrases like it , while the other group tends to talk about the family . Another area of apparent convergence is that both schools of thought would acknowledge that in some situations parental care is so bad that children should be removed and kept away from their parents .",0

"Repeated notes , both in groups of twos and threes , are a characteristic feature of horn writing , and though passages requiring considerable agility are to be found in most modern scores they are usually well and safely doubled by other instruments , as they are apt to sound woolly and ill - defined in shape if left to the horns alone . Shakes are possible if confined to notes within the treble stave , but opportunities for their appropriate use are very rare and the inexperienced orchestrator is advised to keep his horn parts in general as simple as possible and to avoid wide and ‘ unvocal’ leaps . The high and low notes require different embouchures . This rule is not a rigid one , however , especially in unison passages for the two horns . High notes have become less of a strain to play since the well - nigh total adoption of the ‘ double horn’ .",1

"I survived in the school until after ‘ O’ levels and into the sixth form , but only for one term . By this time I had begun to learn braille and a more constructive use of my white stick , other than tripping up people who got in my way . Discussions about my future took place behind closed doors , and sometimes in my presence as though I was n't there . It was decided I should go to special school and my mother 's objections were mollified by the proof of the academic success that many girls achieved there . In January 1973 I found myself , and the grey metal trunk my eldest brother had used to take to university in 1967 , dumped in an austere fifth form dormitory in the main block of the school .",0

In the long term there must be improvement as Russia industrializes , but in the short term erm presumably we see the development of , of a , of a sort of Stalinist totalitarianism precisely because the screws are really being turned on people as much work is being got out of them as possible in order to accumulate capital and to build up basic industries and , and , and to divert , I mean not just into heavy industries , but to divert er resources into arms production as well . But what they 're not doing is spending loads of money on hospitals and houses and schools and raising the general living standards , they 're spending it all on heavy industry and armaments .

"The tempo for reading is often momentary . It should be harnessed at the very moment.’ Clearly subject coverage is a matter of degree , and no public librarian ( nor any reasonable library user ) would expect to find works of a very specialized nature immediately available on the shelves of a small service point . On the other hand certain subjects at certain levels ( introductory and standard works)should always be represented . Unfortunately public librarians know very little at present about users ' success ( or lack of it ) in searching for particular subjects .",1
"In the end the NL did become demonstrably pro - Conservative and saw off the IML challenge , but divisions like this played their part in ensuring that the British Navy League was never as large or influential as its German counterpart . The second reason for taking the ‘ non - party’ claim seriously is that the various Leagues — and not just the three studied by Coetzee — were frequently critical of the Conservative party and expressed strong reservations about the effectiveness of the Conservatives as a political force . Coetzee , describing the leagues as part of a Conservative effort to get to grips with mass politics and the ‘ new religion’ of socialism , explains the timing of their appearance on the grounds that prior to the 1890s ‘ the Conservatives had no need of recourse to such pressure groups because they already possessed access to institutions adequate for the defence of their interests within the existing sociopolitical framework’ . In other words , the Conservative party , and its propertied core constituency , became interested in new forms of appeal and organization when it became apparent that the political reliability and social stability of the lower orders could no longer be ensured by traditional methods of social and political control . This is to describe the ‘ legion of leagues’ from the top down , identifying them as part of a new ‘ technique of rule’through which the Conservative party attempted to confront a new form of politics and a novel political threat .",0
"Rip Torn , who was first choice for the part that Nicholson eventually played had finally rejected the pleadings of Fonda and Hopper and pulled out of the project . He wanted $ 4500 for the job — once he had seen what it entailed — whereas because of the limited budget everyone else was on scale , amounting to a few hundred dollars . There were rows between him and Dennis , who could become exceedingly tired and emotional and was already shooting in New Orleans without a script . BBS seriously considered firing Hopper ; the pressure of moving a production team of twenty - three people from state to state , writing the script on the run and persuading innocent citizens of the United States of America who just happened to be passing at the time to appear in the movie , was a heavy burden for all . Hopper will probably agree that he — and the movie — were saved by Nicholson who was sent down by Rafelson as a trouble - shooter in the role of executive producer and ended up playing the third man , the part reserved for Rip Torn .",0
"The farmers get the subsidies , but the miners are supposed to get none . The real trouble is that we hand over £ 18 a week for every family in Britain — a total of £ 14,000 million — through the common agricultural policy .

The tin - pot agricultural policy over there in the Common Market has sent the money to the German farmers and all the rest .",0
"The Roman catholic church , in episcopal statements , unequivocally condemns violence North or South . As seen in Chapter 3 , this was also true in the nineteenth century , despite lower clergy support particularly for the Fenian movement . Cardinal Cullen succeeded in getting three of the four religious provinces of Ireland to deny the sacraments to the Fenians , and only Archbishop McHale of the province of Tuam failed to toe the line . Generally speaking , there is evidence that the church has always tended to support the hegemony of the state qua state . It supported the British state for most of the nineteenth century in Ireland , then supported constitutional politics for home rule ; and when independence came in 1921 , it supported the pro - treaty faction in Southern Ireland and opposed the civil war because that faction was the state .",0
"799 out of 1,880 comments is a large enough amount to seriously compromise any conclusions about the number of potential risks visible in any stimulus .

Post hoc comparisons showed that both high and low risk exemplars received significantly more of this type of risk information than the medium risk exemplars ( p<0.05 ) . To remove any effects of the risk information not corresponding to descriptions the original data was recoded . This time potential risks were only coded if at least one subject from the other condition described the same information from the five second section of film .",1

"NEWPORT BEACH – Imagine for a moment that you are the chief policymaker in a successful emerging - market country . You are watching with legitimate concern ( and a mixture of astonishment and anger ) as Europe ’s crippling debt crisis spreads and America ’s dysfunctional politics leave it unable to revive its moribund economy . Would you draw comfort from your country ’s impressive internal resilience and offset the deflationary winds blowing from the West ; or would you play it safe and increase your country ’s precautionary reserves ? That is the question facing several emerging - market economies , and its impact extends well beyond their borders . Indeed , it is a question that also speaks to the increasingly worrisome outlook for the global economy .",0

To the traveller , said Bill , ‘ It would give you a thrill To hear all the tales of my youth Of days dead and gone But the memory lives on And I swear every word is the truth.’ Well the traveller grinned And Billy beginned To tell the most marvellous tales Of earthquakes and crimes And fabulous times And whole families swallowed by whales .",0
"Neighbouring Middlesbrough has always been developed as the regional centre .

"Primate societies are remarkable among relatively long - lived and large - brained animal groups in that they have the capacity to store and retrieve much independently acquired information about their environment . In the case of hominids , this has traditionally been attributed to selection for hunting efficiency in the Pliocene . It has been plausibly argued that this , perhaps too male - centred explanation , begs the question of what led to the increasing mental complexity necessary for hominid evolution in the first place , particularly when the older ancestors seem to have been tropical forest primary consumers . Milton has suggested then that the extreme diversity of plant foods in tropical forests and the way in which they are distributed there in space and time has been a major selective force in the development of advanced cerebral complexity in certain higher primates . The capacity to use young leaves with a high protein content may have permitted the emergence of large primates in the first place , but primates capable of remembering the sites and fruiting and leafing patterns of a wide variety of plants , could move more directly to such food , when and where available , more efficiently than those searching randomly .",0

"Imaginative porters can also top up their salaries through complicated deals with nightclubs and restaurateurs who are keen to have them recommend their establishments . Restaurant PR Elizabeth Crompton - Batt says she makes an effort to ensure that all concierges are kept informed of new openings : ‘ We certainly write to them and sometimes they come along to launch parties.’ In the main , most hotels seem happy to let their concierges work the system to their advantage , providing their more entrepreneurial traits do not get the better of them , as they did in the case of those at the Heathrow Penta .

"They will also recognize that the alternative attitude , the selfish gene view of life , has a deep problem of its own . That problem — almost the reverse one — is why individual organisms exist at all , especially in a form so large and coherently purposeful as to mislead biologists into turning the truth upside down . To solve our problem , we have to begin by purging our minds of old attitudes that covertly take the individual organism for granted ; otherwise we shall be begging the question . The instrument with which we shall purge our minds is the idea that I call the extended phenotype . It is to this , and what it means , that I now turn .",0

"As for cars , a study of twenty - five countries concluded that a 10 per cent fuel price increase produced only a 3 per cent improvement in fuel economy .

"His economic theorizing , which remained at this period within the framework of neo - classical doctrine , was driven by policy considerations . But then came a turning - point .

Whereas , therefore , his Treatise on Money ( 1930 ) has been accounted for along ' externalist ' lines , as the response to a political context , the General Theory of 1936 is best understood in ' internalist'terms , as the outcome of a process of intellectual discovery .

"Ultimately , when the chemical reaction is completed , the pattern is destroyed by diffusion .

Though felt rugs are more likely to be traded these days than silk , a number of other commodities are on offer from wicker baskets and wooden cabinets to horses and , in the food line , even doughnuts and bagels . To help us get our bearings there are three pages of typewritten text and a couple of maps which show that Kashgar is surrounded by China , Tibet , India , Pakistan , Afghanistan and Russia .",0
"Jagged blue lightning stabbed through one of the ragged gaps and found the only thing in the office block that was moving . A piercing bolt of blue fire hit Rohmer between the shoulder blades , flinging him across the office in a shower of sparks .

Oxford have a problem . They do all the attacking but the other team do all the scoring .

"We should be concentrating on particular aspects of school life , not producing information which already exists and duplicating it . ( Senior Teacher ) Another reason for the lack of evaluative comment in self - appraisal reports was , paradoxically , the fact that there would be an ensuing inspection and therefore that things could be brought up orally with advisers rather than put in black and white : I did n't put an evaluation in because I wanted to discuss it orally with my adviser .

"One girl starts by picking up all the beads in one hole on her side . Then she drops them , one at a time , into the next four holes . When she drops the last bead , she picks up all the beads in that last hole ( both hers and her opponent 's if that 's the case ) , and continues to drop them , hole by hole , around the board . She continues like this until either her last bead drops into an empty hole and her turn ends;or her last bead dropped creates a new four - bead group in one hole . If she does create a new four - bead group , she ' wins ' these four beads and takes them off the board , leaving the hole empty .",1

"Other displays , however , should be changed regularly in order to maintain enthusiasm . In addition to wall displays thought needs to be given to the equipment which can be used in the room , e.g. does the teacher always have to use the overhead projector or slide projector with the whole class or can groups of pupils go and view a selection of slides independently as needed ? The teacher might think of extra resources : a box of artefacts ( some of which may be replicas ) which the pupils can handle ; a bookcase with additional reference materials including dictionaries and atlases as well as appropriate texts of higher and lower levels or a selection of visual materials for study . Where paper based source materials are being used , the teacher must give thought to ease of access for retrieval as well as the effectiveness of storage . Worksheets which are in good condition are treated with more respect than those which too quickly are crumpled , torn or part company with the staples or covering .",1

"In fact , school is an institution which has little meaning for ‘ the lads’ : it has merely to be ‘ got through’ as enjoyably as possible — by ‘ having a laff’and rehearsing the loyalties and possibilities for defiance and resistance which will be carried over into work . Wage labour , like school , is essentially meaningless — as is the ‘ work ethic’ designed to perpetuate it . According to Willis , ‘ when the lads arrive on the shopfloor , they need no telling ( from those already there ) to ‘ take it easy’ , ‘ take no notice’ or that ‘ they’(the management ) always want more ; you 've had it if you let them get their way.’ They have no illusions about social mobility and success : they refuse to acknowledge or accommodate the values on which the ultimate security of the mainstream culture depends .

"Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past , the young people of Eastern ~ Europe ’s post - communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured .

I began ' Great Expectations ' with a very negative view towards it but as I read on I began to really enjoy it . It is a story by an older Pip reflecting back on his life story . This book follows young Pip through his life and into his mid thirties and shows his highs and lows . It also follows Pip 's intensely painful and burning love for Estella who does not return his love but merely plays with his feelings under the guidance of her guardian Miss Havisham . Dickens chooses his characters and their names very carefully as is clearly shown with the character of Pip .,1

Three auctions were held between May 1987 and January 1988 and four were held during 1991 .

"First of all , it should be recalled that the European idea began as a project for ensuring peace and democracy among Europe ’s peoples . When the new currency was introduced in 1999 – and even more so when European citizens had their first opportunity to use it in January 2002 – it was experienced as the most tangible , decisive proof that European integration was a reality . As the slogan goes : euro in your wallet , Europe in your pocket . Twenty years after the European ~ Parliament was elected by universal suffrage in 1979 , the introduction of the euro marked a logical extension of the European dream . It should also be recalled , however , that when Slovenia entered the eurozone in 2007 , many people suggested that the country was somehow joining “ Old Europe . ”",1

Langhorne was an impossible , fiercely dangerous dirt track , practically round , full of ruts ; hot and unprotected , but Mario — as he often liked to point out — had n't been born with a silver spoon in his mouth ; he could n't afford the fare to Europe ; meanwhile , while dreaming of his grand prix heroes , he 'd just have to be better than anybody else at what was available .

"In any fairly homogeneous society the meaning of even such basic valuational words as ‘ right’ and ‘ wrong’can only be given in such value charged definitions , which point to the society 's shared values .

"The adjective must of course be one which can plausibly be ascribed to the entity of the subject if the whole is to be grammatically acceptable . Perhaps the most important point to be made about postverbals is to distinguish them from the adjectives in the last remaining position , the extraclausal adjectives , which occur in an identical sequence of syntactic elements , but which correspond to a different surface structure as in:(45 ) the two reformers persevered undaunted two stagehands appeared , breathless They have the different intensional structure : We will postpone discussion of the extraclausals until Chapter 9 , but a reliable and well - justified rule of thumb is that extraclausals , unlike postverbals , are always equivalent , in their semantic effect , to otherwise similar constructions where the adjective appears in initial position . Both the following sentences may be accepted as grammatical , but only the second is equivalent to any sentence which has already been cited in this section:(46 ) ill , their best salesman fell breathless , two stagehands appeared The intensional pattern corresponding to ( 44 ) is that of ( 47 ) , where once more the property instantiated by the adjective is underlined:(47 ) The mapping of the intensional pattern onto the surface syntax of English is again very direct and very natural , being reflected solely in the order of the instantiating elements , with again adjectival form as an overt marker that the second property is applied to the initial E. What ( 47 ) suggests , however , is that the similarity of construction is not between postverbal and predicate qualifier , which has the intensional structure given in ( 48 ) , but rather between postverbal and adverbal , the intensional structure for which is repeated here as ( 49):(48)(49 ) From the point of view of the adjectival property,(47 ) and ( 49 ) are essentially the same ; the adjectival property syntactically qualifies another property word , while it is applied to the entity of the noun phrase in immediate construction with the property expression of which the adjective forms part .",0

"Early reports had the sadhus sweeping the Mughal army in front of them — until , so it was said , Aurangzeb deployed strange magic against them . It was the golden age of the fakirs . Their activity amazed and baffled even the sceptical Bernier : ‘ They tell any person his thoughts , cause the branch of a tree to blossom and to bear fruit within an hour , hatch an egg in their bosom within fifteen minutes , producing what ever bird may be demanded , and make it fly around the room.’ Later , when Aurangzeb ordered the decapitation of the naked fakir Sarmad , an Armenian Jew who had converted to Islam , the sage allegedly picked up his head and walked up the steps of the Jama Masjid .

"For most people such details might be rather boring , but Robertson makes the narrative come alive through the personalities .

With the help of Fred ( later Sir Frederick ) White , Bowen managed to keep the project out of the clutches of the Australian National University ( at one stage he nearly took the whole setup to the United States ) , and he used friends in high places to raise large sums of money from the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations .

"Whatever may have occurred earlier , it seems most likely that the sustained recovery of population did not take place until the late fifteenth or the early sixteenth century . This conclusion would be supported by the evidence of the Phelps Brown index of real wages .

They show considerable fluctuations in the annual level of real wages , but are markedly higher in the early fifteenth century than they had been in the late fourteenth . In some years in the 1430s wages failed to keep pace with high prices , but they rose again in the next two decades .",1

But the reluctance to take account of the new obligations imposed by government to consider the housing needs of the working classes also derived from more political motives . Since their inception in 1888 and 1894 rural councils had remained largely in the hands of landowners and farmers . A rough rule - of - thumb was that landowners controlled the rural county councils and farmers the rural district councils ( which were given responsibility for housing ) . As the principal ratepayers in the locality — even after the de - rating of agricultural land in 1927 — they pursued a low rateflow expenditure policy and therefore were extremely reluctant to commit local authority expenditure to the building of houses which could become a burden on the rates . They were particularly reluctant to subsidize council house rents out of the general rate in order to allow farm workers access to local authority housing .,0

"For Emerson I972 was a fine year : with a full season in FI behind him and with a winning car , he drove with assurance , confidence and verve , though still finicky if conditions were not favourable to him , as at Monaco in the rain . It is detracting nothing from his ability as a driver to say that his first championship , in I972 , he owed to a markedly superior car . The fact is that he had much to do with the development of that car , that he worked hard , drove cleanly and finished steadily : those are the marks of a real champion rather than a flash in the pan . He carried into 1972 the kind of driving which had made his reputation in 1971 , and if you study the fact - sheets for that year — the inaugural race at Paul Ricard in France is a good example — you will see Emerson well back on the grid and yet prevailing in the end to finish well enough . So it was that in 1972 the knowledge that consistency paid off , that concentration was necessary , that racing went to the prudent as well as to the bold began to pay off for Emerson .",0

You will always know a steel can by using a magnet — if it sticks , it 's steel ! If it does n't stick , then it 's almost certainly an aluminium can .",1
"Another larva provides evidence for the next step in vertebrate history . The rivers of Europe and America contain animals that look like the lancelet , though they are somewhat larger , up to 20 centimetres long . They , too , live in holes in the mud and filter - feed . They are jawless , blind and without fins except for a fringe around the tail . For many years they were thought to be adult creatures , given a special name , ammocoete , and classified as obvious relatives of the lancelet .",1

"At the time it had been easy enough to make the pledge he had demanded , since she had n't been able to imagine a situation where she would ever want to attack anyone . But that had been before she had met Adam Burns ! For a moment she wavered , torn between the desire to finally get the best of him in something , and the equally strong need to stick to her word . At last her conscience won out and she gave a tiny sigh , wishing not for the first time that she could , just occasionally , be a touch more ruthless . ' I would n't give you the satisfaction , ' she said , tilting her chin scornfully .",0
"Henderson , Joseph and Pene owe much to their Otago and Mains ' background , but Pene particularly offers much in the back row . The front row looks solid enough , but there must be some worries about the locking of the scrum with only Jones having any real international background and Cooksley the only one to compare in size with the big locks of other countries . Mains and his men have chased after the mobile forwards and only time will tell whether this philosophy of fast - footed men will work in the rough and tumble of test rugby . As insurance the selectors have picked seven loose forwards and this may emphasise one of the great worries about the touring side . An Australian tour only requires a 25 or 26-man squad from New Zealand , with replacements only three hours away .",0

"OR DRAWING ? Drawing packages are commonly used for graphic design , creative and technical illustration , editing clip - art and so on , and are n't intended to give a photo - realistic finish . The basic technique is a little harder to get to grips with than painting and has a flatter , more geometric look , but it 's ideal for complex illustration because it is easy to edit precisely . And for the majority of users , vector format clip - art has proved a quick and easy way to produce simple , bright graphics to enhance a form or letterhead . You can run clip - art through a drawing package and edit it for a more personal touch very quickly , and the printing quality is consistent , which is n't always the case with bitmaps .",0
"The region ’s entire value system – a political culture forged by autocracy – is being transformed . Arab men and women have shed the sense of humiliation and inferiority that despotism imposed on them – and that fostered desperation , anger , violence , and insularity . This transformation , though far from complete – indeed , it may well last years – has nonetheless started to bear fruit . If the 2011 uprisings had not occurred , we would now be witnessing another year of autocracy , with more talk of dynastic successions . That would mean further humiliation for ordinary people , who bear the brunt of corruption , as government officials and their crony capitalists continued to siphon off public funds .",0

"In this case , the relative weighting of lexical : syntax : semantics could be 4:2:1 . These weightings may then be adjusted relative to the pattern recogniser . Indeed , these weightings could possibly be adjusted’ on the fly’ , according to the degree of confidence associated with each analyser . However , the assignment of confidence ratings to the output of each analyser remains a highly contentious issue , and one that is discussed at greater length in Chapter Seven . An empirical investigation could provide some answers to this question , by testing a variety of permutations , running the system using a given input , and measuring the overall recognition rate for each permutation .",0
"Unless one supposes there to be two categorially different kinds of appearances presented to the mind it will then seem that this flat circle must be the only object of visual perception , and the round globe I seem to see , the epistemic appearance , must really be a judgement I mistake for a sensation . I am so used to leaping from the sensation , the flat circle , to the judgement , a globe , and do it so quickly , that I do not notice I have done it . Before going on to the second reason for Locke 's not acknowledging the existence of epistemic appearances I must correct a false impression I may have given , that all the seventeenth - century philosophers who succeeded Descartes toed the Cartesian line about the mind perceiving things by being causally affected by them . One of the interesting exceptions was Antoine Arnauld . His principal work in philosophy is a detailed refutation of Nicolas Malebranche 's Cartesian theory of perception and of his non - Cartesian , Augustinian , doctrine of ' vision in God ' , the doctrine from which George Berkeley sought to dissociate himself .",0

"If you use the stake itself to make the hole , you could easily split it . Drive the stake in and tread it firm . With the stake firmed in the hole , hold the tree up with a simple string loop , and plant it just as you would for a bush — except that , without the bud to go by , you will have to look carefully for the soil ‘ tide mark’ where it was growing in the nursery and finish off to that height , with the standard stem about 1½–2 inches ( 4–5 cm ) from the stake . Again , you may find it helpful to lay a cane across the planting hole . At this point , whatever you are planting , take a firm hold of your plant with a gloved hand and give a gentle but firm pull , as though pulling it up again !",1

"In Foca , 50 miles south of the Bosnian capital , Sarajevo , residents sought refuge in schools and hospitals and European Community monitors were refused access to the town as the Serbian - dominated federal army mopped up Muslim opposition . Straggling columns of federal infantrymen and their local militia allies advanced unopposed on the suburbs of Visegrad as shells rained down on Muslim positions . Their hand - in - glove co - operation has destroyed the final pretence of army neutrality in eastern Bosnia . The advance was a direct snub for America , which hours earlier had criticised Serbian paramilitaries and the regime in neighbouring Serbia for the escalating conflict in Bosnia .

"In particular , there re - appears the stark contrast , which the common law rule also generated , between the position of workers , the business of whose employer is transferred by a purchase of the shares in the employing company and who are indeed sold with the business , and that of workers whose employer transfers the business itself . If ownership of a majority of the shares of the employing company , whether the employer is a holding company or only one of a number of subsidiaries in a group of companies , falls into new hands , the employees of that company come under the control of the new owners of the company , whether they consent to that development or not . True , in formal terms the identity of the employer has not changed , but in the organisational terms stressed by the Court in Rask and in terms of the sorts of objections to the new controllers that the employees in Katsikas had in mind , the formal answer goes very little distance to meet the substance of their points . If compulsion is not to be the order of the day where the business itself is transferred , can it be accepted when the transfer is of the company which owns the business ? These points were made a long time ago by Kahn - Freund in ( 1940–1 ) 4 MLR 221 , but have never been satisfactorily answered .",1

"As Middlemass ( 1979 , p. 445 ) puts it : ‘ As in 1944–45 , employers and managers in a sense detached themselves from the dangerous appeal to the nation , over the heads of the nine million voters who were also affiliated to the TUC’ . The CBI , which had been vocal enough in calling for ‘ curbs on unofficial strikes’ in the late ' 60s , was alarmed by the massive popular resistance to the Heath government 's stand , and its leader Campbell Adamson suggested that a Tory victory in February ‘ would not solve Britain 's problems’ . If the Tories ' supporters in 1970 had liked the sound of anti - union radicalism , a significant number had decided by 1974 that it threatened to bring the house down around their ears . Second , there is the question of Labour support . The resistance to Heath on the part of the union movement clearly had mass support , but equally clearly this resistance movement was not able to constitute itself , as it were , into a hegemonic political force capable of securing a workable parliamentary majority through the Labour Party and imposing a radical alternative course of social development ( it was much less able , of course , to constitute itself as the nucleus of an alternative state power in an extra - parliamentary manner ) .",0
"Whilst it may seem a far cry from the appalling civil war that has torn Yugoslavia apart or the collapse of the Soviet Union into an uneasy Commonwealth of Independent States , it seems that sport , and rugby in particular , can play its part in preventing the exaggeration and exploitation of nationalist feeling on international occasions . Feelings of xenophobia — a fear or hatred of the foreigner — can so readily by whipped up , turning friendly sporting occasions when the ‘ hype’ has been too great , when the passions have run too high and the pervading atmosphere has been too intense . What comes to mind is a series in the Seventies between South Africa and New Zealand , a couple of unhappy England versus Wales matches , the crowd emotion at the Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield and the World Cup quarter - final in Paris . But by and large rugby has much to be proud of as a vehicle for bringing nations together in a sporting brotherhood when political barriers threaten to keep them apart . Diverse cultures , religions and races have often found common ground and contact in rugby and lasting bridges between nations or peoples have been supported by sporting encounters at all levels .",0
"Far from acting as a buffer against Federalism , it will actually assist it . The fact is that the pace towards a federal Europe is quickening and there is now very little , save the Danes and the British Parliament , which lies in its way . So it is no longer such a hypothetical question to ask , if the nation state were to be abolished ( at least in the sense that it was no longer governed by a sovereign government directly accountable for its actions to the people ) , would a new form of democracy , perhaps more potent than that offered by the nation state , rise from the ashes ? It would mean at the very least , firmly subjugating the Commission to an elected authority . There is no sign at all of this or anything like it happening .",0
"Slack line - out play presented Guisborough flanker Chris Pern with a try which Paul McLuskey converted , but Redcar replied in the 16th minute through flanker Graeme Evans .

"It is frightening how dependent upon drugs we are all becoming and how easy it is for doctors to prescribe them as the universal panacea for our ills .

"While it is undeniable that that system has had a dramatic effect of the development of the market it is incorrect to assume that it is the only one which is influencing it .

So , why has the PC taken so long to get to grips with the market and how is it faring today , some two years after the phrase ‘ desktop publishing’ was coined .

"As they told MPs , they had found that 34 per cent of mothers interviewed in their survey had failed to receive any increase in their housekeeping allowance in the previous year , while prices had risen 7 per cent over the same period ( HOC , 1973 , Vol . II , p. 318 ) . The campaign to get the new ' child tax credit ' payable to mothers was eventually a successful one : while the tax credit - scheme as a whole was abandoned , the child benefit , combining family allowance and child tax allowance and payable to the mother for all her children including the first , rose like a Phoenix from the ashes , in the form of the Child Benefit Act , 1975 . Nevertheless , at one point the Phoenix was very nearly shot down ; the new Labour Prime Minister ( Jim Callaghan ) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer ( Denis Healey ) decided that a transfer ' from wallet to purse ' was a certain vote loser , and they managed to play on old trade union antagon - isms and Cabinet confusion such that the benefit was seriously delayed and nearly abandoned ( Land , 1977a ; Field , 1982 ) . But a ' mole ' leaked Cabinet minutes to CPAG ( New Society , 17 June 1976 ) and the resulting furore meant that Child Benefit was re - scued .",0
"Indeed I wonder whether they will have the time to perform all the many tasks taken on by police authority members , including lay - visiting of police cells attending national committees on a number of subjects or local consultative bodies , there 's a whole list of duties and responsibilities which members of police authorities undertake . Certainly the minimum of one - and - a - half days per month envisaged by the Home Office as being all that will be required , it seems to me to be very wide of the mark . I agree with the Lord of Aberdale that it is vital for the elected representatives on the police authority to be clearly seen to be in the driving seat of the committee . It is a view I believe which is held by everyone connected with policing at local level and additionally , the continuation of the tripartite system with its essential checks and balances on the activities of the three parties involved and My Lords that is the real importance and value of the tripartite system that depends on the local authorities being seen to be in the driving seat .

"For the attempt to explain social phenomena in terms of needs presupposes that they are ‘ given’ concepts which we can apply relatively easily , and use as a basis for enquiry . In our attempt to understand a group of complex phenomena we pick on some ‘ simple’ starting - point such as a need , and proceed to treat it as though it were completely transparent . Marx is deeply opposed to the idea that a theory has a ‘ starting - point’ , and in particular to the claim that social phenomena can be explained as the result of universal properties of individuals , and Althusser sums up his scepticism with an epigrammatic flourish : the classical idea that man makes his own history must be countered with the question ‘ How is the man who makes history made?’ ‘ The individual producer , or the individual as the elementary subject of production , which eighteenth century mythology imagined to be at the origin of society 's economic development … only appeared , even as an ‘ appearance’ in developed capitalist society , that is , in the society which had developed the social character of production to the highest degree.’ By way of solving this problem Marx suggests that individuals are formed by their social context , by the whole collection of physical conditions , conventions , rules and beliefs which make up their experience .",0

This may sound like pie in the sky , but we have already tasted it in Africa , where Sierra ~ Leone ’s Agenda for Prosperity 2013 - 2017 and the Liberia Vision 2030 exemplify the potential of such programs . Progress on meeting national priorities such as peace consolidation , expanding access to justice , or increasing security is monitored locally . Using local systems and capacities , it turns out , can strengthen them .",0
"When the press of grey on either side became too much the motorway fizzled out and abandoned them to the early - evening commuter jam of the North Circular Road . During the slow hops between traffic lights Carson stole sideways glances at his passenger . She 'd reclined the seat again but she was n't sleeping ; her head was turned aside and she was looking out of the window , not really seeing anything . The last few miles to Ealing were covered in a jerking crawl which took more than an hour , and daylight was breaking down into darkness as Alison gave directions through the maze of streets and parked cars away from the main shopping area . Streetlight timers were cutting in and the lamps were glowing red as she pointed to a space and asked Carson to pull in .",1

"Such histories are constituted according to a Saussurian differential relation . Althusser therefore criticizes the Annales historians for merely arguing that periodizations differ for different times , and that each time has its own rhythms . This is not enough , for it is also necessary to ‘ think these differences in rhythm and punctuation in their foundation , in their type of articulation , displacement and torsion which harmonizes these different times with one another’— though it must be added that this begs the question of how such harmonization is achieved . For such times are not even necessarily the obvious ones , ‘ the visible sequences of events recorded by the chronicler’ , they may be invisible , ‘ a complex ‘ intersection’ of … different times , rhythms , turnovers , etc.’ , only visible when their particular concepts are constructed and produced ‘ out of the differential nature and differential articulation of their objects in the structure of the whole’(101–03 ) . As an example of what he means , Althusser refers to Foucault 's , remarkable studies',Madness and Civilization and The Birth of the Clinic , two instances in which the historian has had to construct the concept of their history .",0

Macho and Ulysse were by this time standing upright , concentrating on the movements of the colobus high up in the trees . The monkeys jumped south to avoid Fitz , but Macho was there and rushed up a tree to block the route , while Ulysse , anticipating Macho 's move , rushed into a tree east of both Fitz and Macho . Pressed by Macho , the colobus jumped into Ulysse 's tree , and then into the one guarded by Fitz , who , with an impressive rush , caught the colobus . By then more females were following the hunt from the ground , and all screamed at the top of their voices .",1

"His position is such , however , that it does produce the paradox that God is described in the same context as an impersonal force and the essence of life , and also as omniscient , omnipotent , and benevolent . Gandhi moves from impersonal to personal descriptions of God without difficulty and while he expresses preference for an impersonal God he is not averse to describing God in personal terms . On the other hand , it might he argued that when he moves from the concept of impersonal truth to the concept of a personal God , he is distinguishing , in traditional Advaitin fashion , between higher and lower levels of truth or reality . But acceptance of this argument involves acceptance of the superiority of the higher , impersonal level of truth over the lower personal level of truth and the acknowledgment of two levels of knowledge . Gandhi , as we have seen , sees no superiority in conceiving of God in impersonal rather than personal terms so it is difficult to see how the traditional distinction between higher and lower levels of truth can be applied to him .",0
"The curvy pattern in figure 11.11 was very clear , but sometimes , when the relationship is not so strong , it is hard for the eye to tell if a transformation is required . A useful diagnostic guide is given by the half - slope ratio , introduced in section 10.6 . As a rule of thumb , we should explore the possible improvement of fit that a transformation would bring whenever the half - slope ratio is greater than 2 . The overall picture in figure 11.12 suggests that life expectancy can be predicted pretty accurately from a country 's GNP : wealthy countries have healthier populations . GNP could be vindicated as a measure of welfare by this finding .",0
"Compliance with these rules will be enforced by the appropriate authorities in each member state . It has already been pointed out that requiring the fulfilment of identical requirements in all member states may be unnecessary , and that recognition of equivalent standards may be a better approach , in particular to the question of harmonising the rules on the conduct of various types of business activities in the member states . This approach may well bear fruit if applied to the future harmonisation of company law strictly so - called , and indeed to the harmonisation of national rules on the conduct of particular classes of business activity . Directives in the field of banking and insurance already bear witness to the potential for such a flexible approach to harmonisation . In such fields a double need arises : to harmonise licensing requirements for companies intending to carry on the activities in question , and to establish essential standards for the prudential supervision of companies providing financial services .",0
"But I wish to relate to the council a particular episode , which I hope will convey something to those people who are perhaps still wavering erm , and whilst we all have principle stands on issues it behoves us as members to consider the views of our constituents and the sorts of things that take place in our wards . And I remind this council of something I said a few years ago of an incident , incident concerning the Atherstone hunt in my ward where the hounds attacked the dogs of , a couple of dogs of a constituent of mine in his back garden totally uncontrolled , they were running amuck right across land in Ellistown this is nothing the hunt could do nothing the hunt tried to do they were too busy off still dashing ahead chasing the fox or what they thought was a fox . Meanwhile the owner the person who lived a small terraced property , whose garden backs onto the fields tried to get the hounds several dozen hounds off these two dogs who were being savaged to death and he had a heart attack in the process , Chairman and was hospitalized for several weeks That Chairman is the effect of the hunt on one of my constituents whose job it is for me to defend the rights that I was elected here to defend the rights of my constituents , not to be harassed in this manner . Of course he was released from hospital and he recovered and of course we we , he , we protested to the hunt and they had the audacity to off to offer him some fifty pounds compensation , which was a adding insult to injury .

"In later , calmer moments , those conclusions which are not based on published research material need to be contested . There is a world of difference between research findings based on safe academic principles and methodology , and those produced with graphic literary phrases , but based upon anecdotal heresay , recorded by listeners blessed with total recall . This attack was repeated again in 1987 in the Federation magazine , for the report had obviously hit a very raw nerve . Its frenzied rejection was very different to that of the many projects listed in the Police Foundation or Home Office Registers of Research mentioned above , most of which are simply ignored and never ever receive any review . I believe the denial of the PSI report and the furore it caused occurred precisely because it managed to get beneath the surface of police culture to explore the deep structures of belief and to comment adversely about their influence on police activities .",0

"The proposals were believed to be ‘ an attempt to cash limit a demand led service which will damage the doctor / patient relationship and be detrimental to patient care.’ In Scotland , however , the approach was different . A paper which I and colleagues in Grampian prepared for Scottish General Medical Services Committee posed the questions does this present an opportunity for general practice to have greater influence in the provision of health care for our patients ? does it put general practice in the driving seat in helping to determine the range and quality of health service provision ? or might it constitute an intolerable administrative burden on the constrained resources of an increasingly cash limited primary care service ? In a characteristically pragmatic way , the BMA in Scotland persuaded the government to allow the proposals to be tested . A shadow fundholding exercise was agreed that would be independently evaluated to assess the effects on the care of patients and look at the administration structures , consulting patterns , and use of doctors ' time .",0

"What 's more , though it seems not to be generally realized , Pound recognized what had happened and acknowledged it ; he did so in the public welcome he gave to Binyon 's translations of Dante , which employ a very archaic and convoluted diction indeed . And this was not the only occasion on which he protested , in the 1920s and 1930s , at having the precepts that were formulated to meet the special conditions of 1914 taken as absolute and binding for all poetic situations at all times . He does not , however , retract his proposal that the precepts of the imagist manifesto are still the best rules of thumb for ‘ the neophyte’ , the beginner in his ‘ prentice - work ; and for what it is worth my own experience in the workshop certainly bears that out . The notion that we crucially need , I think , to do justice to the conflicting claims of the amateur and the professional in these matters , is the idea of thresholds . In verse writing , as in virtually any other human activity we may think of , there are thresholds to be reached and crossed : below a certain threshold of practice and expertise , the attitude of the amateur produces only work that is ‘ amateurish’(and heaven knows , we see plenty of that all around us ) ; above a certain threshold of facility , the attitude of the professional produces work that is glib , facile , heartless , and academic — and we see plenty of that , too .",0

"As people avoid more and more they become a prisoner of their anxiety . We must always remember that a panic attack has its basis in the alarm reaction which is a normal bodily mechanism which has helped to keep the species of man alive in situations of danger for thousands of years .

Mankind would have died out long ago if this was the case . It is not and an acute anxiety attack will not harm you .",1

"Unfortunately , girls may be encouraged to keep their voices high , perhaps because it sounds sweet and makes them appear vulnerable and feminine . An artificially high voice can be achieved quite unconsciously by tightening the diaphragm and keeping tension in the neck .

"To be fair , the very earliest examples of misrepresentation were considered normal practice by the artists themselves . Before the days of audiences counted in millions , it was quite acceptable for artists to imitate other artists . One example which comes to mind is Bransby Williams , who emulated the performances of Charles Dickens and Sir Henry Irving throughout the first half of this century . In the late l9th century it was apparently a normal party - piece to imitate a well - known literary figure , signing - off with the name of the victim ; this has caused some confusion today , where recordings ‘ signed off’ by Sir Henry Irving and Oscar Wilde now have their authenticity questioned .

"And again one of the great concerns that we have with the development of N H S Trusts , is those Trust Boards are able to determine their own policies in respect to staffing , to set their own pay scales for staff , also they are able to do their business to a large extent behind closed doors . Legally they are only required to have one public or open meeting at which the Community Health Council is invited to attend . Again my concern about that is that Trusts bring with them a shroud of secrecy , able to do business behind closed doors . And much of the concerns that we 've been able to express about the Health Service has been as a direct consequence of us having information as to for example the numbers of bed closures , as for example the numbers of people on waiting lists .

"Practical Issues When people think of giving help or support to those in trouble they nearly always imagine that this help will need to be of an intense and emotional nature .

"( d ) What level of soil erosion need occur before appropriate legislation is implemented and appropriate agricultural and pastoral technologies ' induced ' ? So it can be seen that what was originally a technical question of the definition of tolerable rates of soil loss is a crucial , and deeply ideological one , and therefore not amenable to the cut - and - dried standards of proof on empirical grounds . However , let me put a view which though not provable , is perhaps persuasive — even if persuasion is the lowest form of proof .

As we have already noted , David Rolfe did likewise in his widely publicised series Jesus : the Evidence , which was followed by a book bearing the same title . And in The Sea of Faith , Don Cupitt , Lecturer in Divinity and Dean of Emmanuel College , Cambridge , presented perhaps the most penetrating television study yet undertaken of Christianity today — a study containing statements far more contentious than those of the Bishop of Durham .

"Yes , I mean this is the point I 'll be developing later , later in , in , in the lectures , I 'm currently spending a lot of time kind of researching and thinking about this , but i i it 's ultimately the question of genes affect behaviour and more and more I come to the to the view that they probably do so erm through what we call our emotions , that our genes kind of erm guide us to do so and things through various subjective feelings like when we 're hungry , we , we know we 're hungry and it 's a subjective feeling of hunger . What is actually happening of course we know in that case what is actually happening , because nerves erm er neurones in , in the base of the brain are actually sampling the blood flow as it goes through with sugar level and when the sugar level drops to a critical point , some of those neurones start to fire and as they fire gradually the message is passed on up to the higher brain centres and eventually you get the feeling you 're hungry . Now , you , you 're , that 's a subjective feeling , you do n't actually know that there are neurones in your blood sugar level , but you , you certainly know when you need something to eat and it , it 's a kind of subjective feeling and it 's not farfetched in the least to claim that our genes have rigged our brain in that way to do that because obviously we 'd like to have more reproductive success if you know when you 're hungry than when you do n't and it may be that a lot of , in a lot of other ways genes affect our , our behaviour through similar erm effects , that is subjective feelings we have , often of an emotional nature to make us want to do certain things and an an and dislike doing others , and it may be that we , we 're really kind of lumbered with that . Why is it in the genes why is it people are able to adjust their diets Well , oh yes , I 'm sure I 'm not saying that 's the only thing that controls people 's food intake I mean clearly there are things cultural some cultures , the Japanese seem to love eating raw fish , I mean how they can bring themselves to do it I do now know , I mean the raw is I do n't think I 'd want to eat again , but er erm not always if they were cooked either , but erm the , the er and certainly if you look at the Australian Aborigines even though we take the Australian Aborigines as our kind of primeval people , they have astonishing food taboos , I mean their attitudes to food are very very culturally er effective to , to a quite extraordinary extent , some so that somebody somebody discovered that eating a tabooed food by accident , they 'll get very ill , a kind of psychosomatic illness .",1

"They had exploited this idea as doing more justice to the nature of life and movement and the discovery of truth than the older rationalist insistence on the ' law of non - contradiction ' . Put crudely , that law states that if A contradicts B , at least one of them must be false . This was felt by the Romantics to be too static , too absolute , too cut - and - dried , and to leave no place for the dynamics of discovery , the interplay of diversities , the movement from partial to fuller understanding , the connection between the inward and the outward , the whole and the part , the individual and the universal . Apparent oppositions , they felt , should not only be tolerated but gloried in : ultimately they would prove to be resolvable in a wider harmony . Hegel 's dialectic brought this sense to a further degree of refinement .",0

"[ F]ew reports have assembled so much wisdom whilst proving so completely useless , as the Report of the Committee on Ministers ' Powers … [ I]n no important respect did the report influence , much less delay , the onrush of administrative power , and the supersession of the ordinary forms of law which is today taking place . … Its report restored to the public a sense of security , which had been badly shaken by Lord Hewart 's book , and which subsequent events have proved to be false . Nevertheless , while the Report may have rejected the reactionary normativist ideology it is also the case that it did nothing to challenge the dominant legal culture . Orthodox legal views on the nature of social legislation and the relationship between that legislation and the common law remained untouched by the Report .",1

"For both countries , the special relationship between them is their primary foreign policy priority , and the European Community remains principally an instrument of their foreign policy needs . Before going on to examine the Franco - German relationship and the German Question in the next chapter , however , it is worth asking what it is about Britain that makes it so sensitive over national sovereignty . The London correspondent of the Russian newspaper , Literaturnaya Gazeta , recently put the matter in a nutshell : European integration will weaken the British parliamentary system . For Italy or France this is of no particular significance , since the role of their parliaments is not great , but Britain would be depriving itself of its most important political institution .",0
"If , of course , her grief becomes prolonged and it seems that she is making no headway towards adjustment , it will be advisable for her to see her doctor , but this rarely happens . Helping an elderly parent through her sorrow can be a long , hard haul , but very rewarding in the end — not only in terms of her recovery , but also because , if you find yourself in the same position in later years , you will look back on this experience you shared with her and find that it has left you with a far deeper understanding of grief , and a greater confidence in the healing power of time to see you through your own period of adjustment to loss . Bereavement is the one battle in which people dice with a death that has already occurred in order to survive all the dangers of the loss and deprivation it brings , and it takes courage to stand shoulder to shoulder with someone who is in the thick of it . But fortunately the dice are almost always loaded in their favour , and if we decide to fight with them the end result , for them and for us , can be that ' Out of this nettle , danger , we pluck this flower , safety ' .

"In early November Coleridge and the Wordsworths , whose deep and intuitive friendship had begun by now to exclude not only Sara but even Tom Poole , set out on the road to Porlock which Coleridge had taken the previous month . Coleridge introduced his friends to the steep woodland track leading from Porlock Weir to Culbone , and together they walked on for four miles beneath the trees , before emerging close to Broomstreet Farm and Yenworthy . By dusk Lynmouth had been reached , and next morning they went the short distance to the Valley of the Rocks , a strange and desolate dry valley running parallel to the coast and bordered by great castellated tors of rock . The landscape of the valley was quickly reproduced in an unfinished prose tale , ' The Wanderings of Cain ' , a story of murder and remorse whose details were discussed on this November tour . It was decided that Wordsworth should write the first book or canto of the tale , Coleridge the second , ' and which ever had done first , was to set about the third ' .",1
"Indeed , the sea can be a dull subject when not seen as the setting for human activity and emotion . In this sense , Mr Raban 's vessel is undermanned . It is known that the sea is cruel , but it is also humourless , so few laughs are prompted by this book and after some glum pages it is easy to crave even the schoolboy humour of Stephen Leacock 's skit , Soaked in Seaweed . An exception to this solemnity comes when Mr Raban breaks his own rule and allows stowaways on board .

"Such a companion volume , though different in flavour from the rest , could provide the necessary framework on which the detailed volumes could be hung in context , and to which the reader could refer to maintain an overall perspective of the series .

"Closures of railway lines had been taking place for many years , accelerated by the growing availability of cars in the 1950s .

Dr Beeching 's famous report of January 1963 then opened the floodgates to closure proposals , battles by campaigners and , invariably , consent by the Conservative Government which , after all , was the architect behind Dr Beeching 's appointment as Chairman charged with reducing losses .

"The result is that a student may have answered half the paper in a manner worthy of a Law Lord , and yet obtain a third class because he has not answered the other half .

A candidate may , therefore , get 50 per cent . on the whole paper if he answers all the questions moderately well , whereas he certainly will not get 50 per cent .",1
"Since the whole sequence of events begins with an external event , one option is to identify what external events tend to trigger unproductive feelings and to arrange to avoid or change the external events themselves . The snag with this is that it is often impossible to avoid the triggering events altogether and in any case it might be better to face them squarely and control your reactions to the events rather than the events themselves . However , even if you draw a blank , it is always worth checking to see whether or not you can influence the external event that starts the sequence , so either while you are being hindered by an unproductive feeling or after an experience where you were hindered ask yourself : ‘ What external event has triggered this feeling?’ If you can identify it , ask yourself ‘ can I do anything to avoid or minimize my exposure to this external event in the future?’ If the answer is yes , firm up an appropriate avoidance plan .",0

"Twelve schools submitted satisfactory proposals and each was given £ 400 to help carry out its project .

"Herpes simplex infection , when it involves the cervix , can cause a profuse discharge . Even measles sometimes produces a vaginal discharge .

"In Britain , ministers were careful to introduce any announcements they made on the matter with assurances that there was no intention to bully Denmark . At the same time it was made clear that British foreign policy was not going to be dictated by the whims of one small country . A way would have to be found by the time of the Edinburgh Summit ( later the Birmingham Summit was introduced for the same purpose ) of providing a form of words ( possibly involving subsidiarity ) which would help the Danes to save face . The prime minister put the Government 's position very clearly in a statement to the House of Commons on 3 June , the day after the Danish vote : ‘ The Government continue to believe that the deal we secured at Maastricht is in the best interests of this country .

"It has been noted by sociologists that in urban settings there is a ‘ norm of civil inattention’ whereby unacquainted people typically refrain from approaching and addressing one another in public . There are of course exceptions to the rule : you can ask someone the time , or for directions ; you can expect to attract comment if your behaviour is somehow deviant , for example you are hopping down the street dressed in a clown suit . In addition , however , whole classes of people are what the sociologist Carol Brooks Gardner calls ‘ open persons’ , fair game for comments from anyone , anytime . Obvious cases include children and people with certain disabilities : but women too are ‘ open persons’ , open to casual comments on their appearance and behaviour . Gardner points out that some street remarks , like endearment terms , are ambiguous : in some circumstances it is acceptable and even kind to greet or compliment another .",0
"It is noteworthy that the teachers in the Art department acted promptly upon most of the recommendations addressed to them . Thus much three - dimensional work was evident in the Art rooms a year later , homework had been given greater emphasis , a tentative start had been made to interdepartmental links with Craft and Needlecraft and the ' O ' and ' A'Level courses were being revised . In marked contrast with this ready compliance , virtually none of the recommendations for action to be taken by members of the Senior Management Team had borne fruit a year later . Individual reports to the Art teachers based on their appraisals had not been drafted , the problems of storage space , blackout , and the inadequate cleaning of the Pottery Hut remained unresolved , and the hoped - for move to adjacent rooms had not occurred . Even the modest recommendation that a member of the department should go on the Active Tutorial course had not been acted upon .",0
"He was expected , quite unrealistically , to foster British trade throughout Europe ; but by the first years of the twentieth century the attaché in Paris had been supplemented by others in Berlin , Vienna , Constantinople , Madrid , Pekin and Yokohama . Germany also began during the first years of the twentieth century to make some patchy and sporadic provision of much the same kind for her trade interests abroad . In France intermittent discussion from 1879 onwards , in which the advocates of change often pointed to Britain and Germany as models , bore fruit at last in the sending in 1904 of a commercial attaché to London at the special request of the embassy there : by 1908 the French diplomatic service included six such appointments . Commercial attachés were not a complete answer to the problem of coping with the increasing volume and importance of economic diplomacy . In 1914 they were still few in number and often had impractically large geographical areas to deal with .",0

"It is ironical that one of the most beneficial developments of the war years , the Representation of the People Act of 1918 , should have occasioned so much party opposition . Consideration of the franchise bad followed Unionist demands for votes for servicemen , and a Speaker 's Conference was set up in 1916 , with the Unionist members led by Sir William Bull and Sir Harry Samuel . It seems that a deal was hatched behind the closed doors of the Conference , by which Unionists accepted a widening of the franchise to include all men and some women , in return for a Liberal agreement to accept some plural votes and a complete redistribution of seats . Liberals had argued for a wider franchise for years and Unionists had demanded a redistribution , so both sides got something of what they wanted and proportional representation was thrown in with the present mood of Labour in mind , so that the anti - socialist parties would be able to consolidate their position if necessary . Unionist reactions to these proposals , published and embodied in the Representation of the People Bill early in 1917 , were very hostile indeed ; it seemed a reckless step to give the biggest ever increase in the franchise in the midst of a major war , to throw away some of the plural votes on which the party had relied , and to receive in return a redistribution that could bring almost anything .",0
"When one does this , it is clear that not every child is equally equipped to cope with the particular purposes and tasks that occur in classrooms . In this context , the linguist 's proclamation of the functional equality of all varieties can be of little help . In addition , it is an assumption that precludes them , to a large extent , from beginning to get to grips with the language- based problems that learners might experience and providing teachers with useful insights into how linguistic factors might help or hinder a child 's progress at school . 3 . This brings us to the third phase , in which linguists have become more generally prepared to question the notion of linguistic equality and to accept that language differences might give rise to difficulties which are not due solely to the social and linguistic misconceptions of teachers .",0

But it begs the question who are they doing it with , if the female averages are really so much lower than the male ? They 're certainly not doing it with other men ( only 3.6 per cent claim to have had homosexual intercourse ) , so can we presume yet again that men just like to say they do it more often .

"Having said this , we should also expect much greater segmentation in terms of impact – and that the consequences will affect both individual countries and the global system as a whole . In some countries – for example , Italy , Japan , and the United ~ States – politics will remain the primary driver of economic - policy approaches . But elsewhere – China , Egypt , Germany , and Greece come to mind – the reverse will be true , with economics becoming a key determinant of political outcomes . This duality in causation speaks to a world that will become more heterogeneous in 2013 – and in at ~ least two ways : it will lack unifying political themes , and it will be subject to multi - speed growth and financial dynamics that imply a range of possible scenarios for multilateral policy interactions .

"But there were positive as well as negative reasons which influenced Scotsmen in the 1540s . So it was not only English hopes which were dashed in 1550 . The great difference between the events of the 1540s and earlier periods of hostility between England and Scotland was that this episode was far more than a particularly dramatic example of the eternal political and military triangle of England , Scotland and France , or even just the revival by Henry VIII and Somerset of that old English dream , the unification of England and Scotland . For this time there were others who shared in that dream , at least to the extent of wanting friendship between England and Scotland . In 1542 , Henry received a long and rambling letter from a crank , one John Elder , clerk of the diocese of Caithness , and therefore claiming to speak for the Highlander .",0

"Nevertheless , whatever the mechanism involved , there is an increasing volume of evidence of a strong correlation between extinctions and magnetic reversals . Thus six out of eight species of radiolarians that have become extinct in the last 2½ million years show a very strong correlation between their last appearance and a reversal horizon . This has been observed in a large number of deep sea cores from both high and low latitudes , though one is tempted to ask how many other species did not become extinct during this period . Naturally , if one goes farther back in time the evidence becomes more shaky , but nevertheless there apparently were reversals in late Permian and late Cretaceous times which coincide with the two most important extinction levels . In any case , there are earthier explanations , such as the changes in sea level favoured by Newell ( 1963 and 1967 ) , or changes in climate ( perhaps themselves brought about by changes in the earth 's magnetism ) which are favoured by many authors .",1
"A suggested rule of thumb might be 1 % of the population aged 65–74 , 10 % of the population aged 75–84 and 25 % of the population aged over 85 would have moderate / severe dementia .

Of these some would inevitably have been admitted to long - stay residential or hospital care , but perhaps 80 would still be living in the community , 30–40 on their own . Although formalised assessment is useful , other factors such as physical illness , family support , degree of isolation , concurrent psychiatric symptomatology etc are likely to determine an individual 's need for day hospital attendance .",0

That it tends to be the lower status , less experienced teachers whose attitudes are most positive and the longest serving , institutionally most powerful teachers who are the most negative may explain why this willingness apparently bears so little fruit .

"Kemp frequently provides details of superficial social acquaintance between scientists and artists and refers to their reading habits . This is , in one sense , unobjectionable and Kemp rightly weighs the evidence for influence circumspectly . However , the very preoccupation with identifying causal influences begs more fundamental questions about whether contemporaries shared intellectual assumptions . For example , the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century was constituted not only by the new theories of Descartes , Galileo and Newton but also by new ways of experiencing the world , interacting with it and thinking about it . According to this claim , the mores of the eighteenth century were radically different from the sixteenth .",0
"The decision is quashed and the authority makes a fresh and legal decision . That decision might be the same as the first one and cause the plaintiff the same loss . In fact , one would expect a public authority always to be inclined to search for a way to reach the same decision legally the second time round , if only to save face ; and the incentive to do so would be even greater if it were likely to be required to pay damages should it decide that its earlier loss - causing decision ought to be changed . Many grounds of public law illegality do not rule out the making of the same decision again . A decision can be illegal because , for example , it was made in contravention of the rules of natural justice ; or because relevant considerations were ignored in making it ; or because the authority was unduly influenced by some external factor , such as the opinion of some other authority or an agreement with a third party .",0

"Charles V 's policy was to prevent this at all costs , and his candidate for Margaret 's hand was his brother Philip , who had been created Duke of Burgundy in 1364 . Margaret 's marriage to either candidate required a papal dispensation , for both were within the forbidden degrees , and Charles put pressure on the Pope to refuse a dispensation for Margaret to marry Edmund Langley . Charles 's diplomacy eventually bore fruit , and on 19 June 1369 Margaret was married to Philip in the Abbey of St Baaf at Ghent . Although Margaret 's father lived on until 1385 , English interests in Flanders were now gradually eclipsed . Bruges was closed to English vessels , and Calais was isolated .",0

"' Nothing to do with us ' , says the Press Office , ' we were just renting out the space ' . But of course , the public saw the strident banners hung throughout the galleries . The lenders , whose objects were left in embarrassing limbo when the show made museum history and went bankrupt a month early , may have asked themselves whether they would have been prepared to lend had it not been held at the V&A , and , in fact , it was the V&A which was left with the unbudgeted task of getting the exhibits back to the owners . So the commercial managers of the museum , who hoped this show would be a money - spinner , are wrong : this exhibition has everything to do with the V&A , its good name , its morale , its duty to the public — and its money .

The ZX Spectrum and Easy Programming attack the same problem area — what the hell do you do once you have unpacked your computer , tried to understand the manual , and realise it is written by people who seem to have forgotten that most of their readers will be neophytes ? The ground covered by both books is , in the early stages , fairly similar . They begin by explaining how the spectrum keyboard works .

"He first of all distinguishes human suffering from that of animals but then defines the latter as ‘ the unpleasant emotional response to more than minimal pain and distress’(1989 : 97 ) . This is hopeless . Not only does it ignore the sense in which suffering can be unwitting but it also begs the question in favour of saying , when specific symptoms like struggling or urination occur in animals , that these are properly to be seen as , emotional responses ' ( which covertly elicits our sympathy for the conscious distress of the stricken human parent rather than the symptoms of it observed in the struggling , yet unaware , athlete ) .

"Chris Hinsley started off as a successful commercial author of arcade games for home computers , and many of Taos 's concepts spring from his original need to produce code that would transfer easily between a plethora of machines . The approach he took was to develop a Virtual Processor — a 32-bit machine with 16 registers and support for standard data types and addressing modes , which did n't actually exist . All applications , and the bulk of Taos itself is written in Virtual Processor code , so that at run - time the code is loaded onto a real processor and translated on the fly into the chip 's native instruction set . The practical upshot is that , as long as you have the right translator , the Virtual Processor code will run without modification on any chip . The 80386 - 80486 translator is the latest to be finished after the original Transputer implementations and Hinsley says that now they have first couple under their belts , it will only take a month or two to write each additional processor implementation .",0

"While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in The Problem of Method that this process of self - consciousness is at last beginning to take place , and that civil , foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle , Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self - consciousness among the masses . The ' detour , of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism 's own descent into its unconscious , resulting in a dream - work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of Marxism 's own reading of history . It is therefore , Sartre argues , our historical task to make it known , promoting not just the historical process as such , but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history , with one meaning — the ' Truth of humanity'(I , 822 ) . Sartre 's account thus sets up the articulation of history , univocal meaning , and totality as the indissoluble set of elements required for the validation of Marxism , necessary in order to save it from its detour from itself . The problem , however , remains how such universals are produced from the multiplicity of initiating individual praxes .",1

The animals must be reared in humane conditions , which means that intensive operations — like battery henhouses or veal units — are forbidden .",0
"On operating systems we wanted to be as truly hardware independent as we can , so we have chosen to operate potentially under any Posix - compliant operating system , so that gives us all the flavours or brands of Unix and a number of proprietary mid - range operating systems which are achieving Posix compliance as time goes by .

As I identified a minute or two ago , our approach to computerizing accounting applications fits hand in glove with the concept of relational database .

Because we are er developers of a core accounting package which we hope will have many many hundreds of users before the end of this decade , we did n't want to rely on the vendor of a particular Four G L , so we 've written our product in C to retain that independence within there .",0
"c ) The cups , saucers , pots and pans in the Home Corner all need washing at intervals .

"They took 4½ hours to beat Chris Palmer , John Thurlbeck and John Leeman from the Co Durham club , Stanley , 19–11 . The previous day they had been on the green 5¼ hours to out - bowl Paddington . Such long stints on the carpet are due to the consistency of leading players , whose skill is such they cancel each other out . With 18 bowls delivered on each of 18 ends , this is pronounced in triples . In this game strong - arm tactics were deployed by both sides to kill five ends and force replays .",0

"This key theme crops up repeatedly throughout the book in all the contributions because it is through language that the hidden assumptions that make up the common sense of both theoretical and empirical discussions are revealed . One of the rewarding products of placing language under the microscope is the abolition of many of the categoric certainties that often inform rhetorical discussion of the inner city . Several examples come to mind here . The dichotomy between private and public sector is not so clear cut as it may appear . In London Docklands state subsidies have hidden under different names , disguising state intervention on a massive scale as Bob Colenutt describes in chapter 2 .",0
"We have even developed theories to justify these distortions by teaching that the high elbow allows greater application of force . Anybody who has played Chinese whispers will know how quickly and easily such distortions happen . In real canoeing the study of experienced paddlers shows that there is very little difference between a high and low brace ( Figure 5 ) and to make a distinction is often counter - productive . The only important factor is whether the face or the back of the blade is in use . In both techniques the key points of a low paddle shaft , an extended reach , a low centre of gravity and a low shoulder angle are equally relevant .",1
"This ' sane insanity ' through which one enters into someone 's personality — intentionally splitting oneself into both searching , inventing subject and the object of the search — is posed as the very condition of narration . But narration is seen in The Dear Deceit as the original and persistent obstacle to ' truth ' because the process of constructing a story inevitably leads to falsification . Philip meditates on the narrative representation of action : ' Strange how the reality of the past comes to our mind most immediately as fiction . Some even say that all our knowledge of the past is fiction'(29 ) . This is both the ' dear deceit ' which goes back centuries and the curse peculiar to modern - day society .",0
"In the end , the notes were still being painstakingly dipped and dried when Kilburn was killed , apparently in revenge for America 's raid on Libya in April 1986 . Another failure , but it is hard not to appreciate the subtlety of the thought behind it : if the cash paid as ransom disintegrates , there is no cash paid as ransom . This was the Iran operation in a nutshell . A policy that could not work was presented as one that could , and a scheme that stood American policy on its head was elaborately argued to be otherwise . To the end — or at least to his testimony in Poindexter 's trial , in 1990 — Reagan maintained he did not believe that he had been trading arms for hostages .",0
"A solution might be to postpone the decision on the issue of damages until after the authority has deliberated again . The danger of this is that the fear of an award of damages against it would unduly encourage the authority to reach the same decision again , thus creating an appearance of bias . Whether this is a real practical difficulty depends on whether the desire to save face would not anyway have this effect of encouraging the same decision to be made again , even if there were no risk of a damages award . On the other hand , public authorities do not usually commit illegal acts deliberately , and if an atmosphere of opinion were created in which compensation for illegality were seen as being simply compensation for loss and not as carrying any stigma of fault or as being designed to perform the function of deterring illegal conduct , public authorities might be able to put the chance of an award out of their mind in deciding the applicant 's case the second time round . There is a danger of viewing compensation for illegality too much in terms of a traditional tort model rather than in terms of distributing widely and thinly the financial ill - effects of governmental ‘ mistakes’ .",0
"Both my husband and I accepted it as a part of our way of life .

"The government should be devoting more time to considering how the wartime counter - inflation policy could be continued in peacetime . As Keynes pointed out , the Treasury 's opposition to planning for post - war full employment was a lost cause , because when post - war plans came under the political spotlight the Labour members of the government would undoubtedly press for an expansionist policy . The Treasury was under a cloud from 1940 to 1943 . This was partly because Sir Horace Wilson , a close adviser of Chamberlain and greatly disliked by Churchill and the Labour Party , remained its official head until 1942 . In part it was due to the association of the Treasury with the economic policy of Baldwin and Chamberlain , men now discredited as appeasers .",0

"The children learn to take responsibility for themselves . However hard parents try to inculcate a sense of responsibility in their children , the habits of childhood die hard . Most mothers have n't the heart to deny their children the care and comfort they have given them all their lives and many continue to run round them long after they are old enough to look after themselves . In order to become a responsible adult , a young man or woman must learn the cost of living , in terms of hard cash and hard work . While they are living at home , so many things are thrown in free .",0

"Kathleen had not dared to mention those things , must pretend that she had not noticed their absence . A small clock had gone from the sitting room , and a watch in a slightly mildewed case .

"Consequently , the above two journal entries could be condensed into one : Since there is only one cash book for the organization , cash does not pass from fund to fund and so is excluded from the journal entry . This practice does beg the question of how different cash figures are found for the different fund balance sheets when a single cash book is kept for the authority . The answer is that , in the process of producing final accounts , the cash amounts for each fund balance sheet are balancing figures . As long as the total of the balancing figures for each fund equals the balance on the cash book , then the accounts as a whole are in balance .",0

"‘ We have been lucky that we managed to convert the right strategy into the right results,’ says Lord Weir . A strategy based on specialisation and tight cost controls dating back to the rescue period has provided the basis for the turnaround under chief executive Ron Garrick . Weir got out of commodity , or off - the - shelf , engineering goods , which it had been making almost since it was founded by the family in 1871 , seeing them as too sensitive to changes to domestic demand and expensive to produce compared with international competitors . Weir put its energies into high value - added , or what Lord Weir calls ‘ brain - based’ , applications , with big design , research and development input , capitalising on the relatively cheap price put on scientific and development expertise in this country . Almost by accident , says Lord Weir , activities were split equally across five sectors : power , oil and gas , water and sewage , naval and marine , and general and industrial — each with a broad spread of international markets .",0

"There were different kinds of customary tenure , but they had in common the fact that they gave some protection to the unfree man against arbitrary expropriation . He was not protected by the King 's court as a free man was , but most lords seem to have recognized that even unfree tenants had certain rights . The fifteenth century saw the development of what was called copyhold tenure , by which a peasant possessed a copy of the entry on the manorial court roll which defined his rights and obligations , as the most common form of land - holding in early modern England . This was not universal — some tenants held land by custom alone , without possessing a copy of the court roll entry , and they were generally more vulnerable to pressure from their lords , as legal protection was gradually extended to copyhold tenants by the courts both of common law and of equitable jurisdiction during the fifteenth century . In some areas , however , customary tenants seem to have been able to obtain security comparable to that enjoyed by copyholders .",1
"Experience has shown that many real situations are lacking in mechanisms for monitoring what is going on , and taking the necessary control action when the required standards are n't being met . Ergo , developing ideas about measures of performance , feedback and control mechanisms is arguably the most important and potentially productive part of the exercise . As a rule of thumb , this element in the main system model can be considered as monitoring the performance of the system as a whole ( for example , ensuring that residents are happily domiciled and day clients receive appropriate support ) , and setting , then maintaining , the standards of each sub - system ( Fig 11.8 ) . This idea of a hierarchy of control allows the analyst to focus on each element in turn , and derive ideas about monitoring and controlling at various levels . With regard to the performance of the catering sub - system ( 1.7.1 ) , this indicated the requirement for information such as the following before adequate control could be achieved , together with mechanisms for feedback on the extent that standards are complied with :",0

"That , in a later work of extensive and original research into little - known source material , carried out in partnership with his wife Marian , Keeton should have something to say in favour of Lord Chancellor Jeffreys , brought him little joy from quarters whose traditional schoolboy images he chose to query .

The closest comparison with another polymath in our time that , in spite of personal and other differences , comes to mind is with Arnold Toynbee . The common denominator is less the substratum of overlapping spheres of knowledge than intuitive awareness and , even more so , shared condemnation from disdainful detractors . To leave the presentation of Keeton on the polymath level would be as arbitrary as concentration on some of his disparate relaxations ; boat - building , cookery or football .",0

"( a ) The individual solicitor Practising Certificates By s1 of the Solicitors Act the essential qualifications for practice as a solicitor are admission as a solicitor , enrolment and the possession of a current practising certificate . To resolve a doubt as to whether employed solicitors not being held out to be solicitors by their employers were required to hold practising certificates , s1A was added by s85 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 in the following terms : 1A. A person who has been admitted as a solicitor and whose name is on the roll shall , if he would not otherwise be taken to be acting as a solicitor , be taken for the purposes of this Act to be so acting [ and therefore being required to hold a practising certificate]if he is employed in connection with the provision of any legal services ( a ) by any person who is qualified to act as a solicitor;(b ) by any partnership at least one member of which is so qualified ; or ( c ) by a body recognised by the Council of the Law Society under section 9 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 ( incorporated practices ) . Where a person continues to act as a solicitor having failed to comply with these requirements he commits an offence under s20 of the Solicitors Act . Moreover , the failure ( even inadvertent ) of a solicitor partner to hold a current practising certificate leads to the automatic dissolution of his firm under s34 of the Partnership Act 1890 , on the authority of Hudgell Yeates & Co v Watson [ 1978]QB 451 ( see below ) .",1

"Yet after a few weeks , during which time only parts of the north of England and the borders had risen on the Pretender 's behalf , the rebellion was put down . In accounting for the failure of the""Fifteen , historians sympathetic to Jacobitism tend to stress how difficult it is to launch a successful invasion , and that all the trump cards lie with the government of the day . Although this is undoubtedly true , on two occasions during the period covered by this book ( 1660 and 1688 ) an invading army ( one from Scotland , the other from Holland ) had been able to exploit a severe domestic political crisis and widespread popular disaffection in order to bring about a change of political regimes . That Mar failed where Monck and William of Orange had succeeded is partly related to military factors , but also reflects the fact that neither the domestic political crisis was so severe nor popular disaffection so widespread in 1714–15 as it had been in either 1659–60 or 1688–9 . The government of George I and the Whigs never lost its credibility , but retained the support of a substantial proportion of the traditional ruling class and probably a higher proportion of the mass of the population than is usually realised .",1

"There seem to have been two main spurs to this research and writing : fascination about the intellectual origins of American republicanism and worry about the civic health of the nation especially after the trauma of the Vietnam war . In the first category we may mention Kettner 's The Development of American Citizenship 1608–1870 ( 1978 ) and more particularly Pocock 's influential The Machiavellian Moment ( 1975 ) . In the second , Pranger 's The Eclipse of Citizenship ( 1968 ) and Walzer 's impressive Obligations : Essays on Disobedience , War and Citizenship ( 1970 ) come to mind . The influence of these publications in Britain is evident in the writings of , for example , Michael Ignatieff and some articles in the New Statesman ( and Society ) . The focus of this work , as also of Adrian Oldfield 's forthcoming Citizenship and Community , is an interest in the lessons which may be derived for modern society from the Classical - Renaissance - Enlightenment emphasis on civic virtue .",0

"His fears seem to be well founded , for a move towards regionalization is now occurring , with a proposal that the forty - three forces disappear into perhaps eight or nine giant regional units . Stead argues that only constant inquiry ( for which I could substitute ‘ inside ethnography’ ) can prevent such an unacceptable trend , and it is some comfort to see a probationary policewoman , such as Cressida Dick ( 1985 ) , pointing out the political compromises such autocracy can produce , but which few of the chief officers seem willing to admit or even acknowledge . However , I am not hopeful that her example will force the institution to reassess its attitude to the critical account , for even the fears of someone like Stead , which came from a central location of police power at the Staff College at Bramshill , seem to have largely fallen on stony ground . In the main , the college has produced little radical comment or research of note during the four decades of its existence , for the various chief officers have jealously ensured that any consolidation of ideological excellence at this location has been neutered , and under Home Office direction its senior courses have primarily been used to provide a stream of suitably acquiescent candidates for the ACPO ranks , who readily take on the symbols and metaphors of dominance which feed the appetite for power Stead warns against . In 1987 I spent the summer at the college on the Intermediate Command Course and found it depressing to see just how little research was being sponsored or carried out there .",0

"In our multicultural schools the sound of the steel pan may evoke Caribbean ethnicity , tradition and authenticity , yet they originate in the oil drums of the Standard Oil Company rather than the mysterious knowledge of ancient African griots . These theoretical problems are most visible and at their most intractable in the area of fostering and adoption policy . Here , the inflated rhetoric and culturalist orthodoxies of antiracism have borne some peculiar fruit . The critique of the pathological views of black family life that were so prevalent in Social Services during the late seventies and early eighties has led directly to an extraordinary idealization of black family forms .

"Rape does not provoke such strong emotions in policemen , and their resistance to dealing with it is expressed more in terms of the greater competence policewomen are supposed to have . However , there might well be other reasons for this . Compared to sex offences on children , which cause universal shock and horror to policemen , in the masculine occupational culture of the station women are sex objects and , in other circumstances , would be considered ‘ fair game’ .

"There can be little justification in the pursuit of a child care policy which relegates the residential care of children and young people to second best and a last resort .

"The point I want to make is that in most cases they could not . There is only a limited amount of change that can be achieved by direct transformation in the ‘ swords to ploughshares’ manner . Really radical change can be achieved only by going ‘ back to the drawing board’ , throwing away the previous design and starting afresh . When engineers go back to the drawing board and create a new design , they do not necessarily throw away the ideas from the old design . But they do n't literally try to deform the old physical object into the new one .",0

"The argument has been made by Martin Howe and others that this will obtain only if an appeal court is superimposed above the Court of Justice . The point , which I find persuasive , is that an appeal court which will be less full - time than the Court of Justice will be less imbued with the centralist perspective , and thus in a better position to maintain an objectivity as between the interests of the EEC and those of the nation state . This is of course to beg the question of where the dividing line between the interest of the nation state and that of the EEC is to be drawn . I am quite clear in my own mind on this . The ‘ bottom’ line is the one that separates those measures which lead to the loss of nationhood from those which are concerned with effecting closer association and cooperation — and freer and fairer trade — between genuinely independent states .",0

"Together , they constitute an important intellectual movement , which also happens to be a large part of the reason that American conservatism today has little that is constructive to say about managing the economy – and little purchase on the center of the American electorate . But let ’s back up historically , to the founding of what we might call modern conservatism in early nineteenth - century Britain and France . There were some – Frédéric Bastiat and Jean - Baptiste Say come to mind – who believed that government should put the unemployed to work building infrastructure when markets or production were temporarily disrupted . But they were balanced by those like Nassau ~ Senior , who spoke out against even famine relief : Although a million people would die in the Irish Potato ~ Famine , “ that would scarcely be enough . ” The main thrust of early conservatism was root - and - branch opposition to every form of social ~ insurance : make the poor richer , and they would become more fertile .",0

Consulting either an architect or a builder , the purchaser then works out an internal plan and discusses how the exterior should look . The Heritage range is the most flexible because cantilever cross frames are used to carry all the first floor loads and most of the roof , leaving internal divisions largely a matter of choice .",0

"MBA - think is particularly effective when the relationship between buyer and vendor is minimal and the communication between the parties is distant and symbolic .

While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in The Problem of Method that this process of self - consciousness is at last beginning to take place , and that civil , foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle , Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self - consciousness among the masses .",0

Argentina 's Jorge Berendt led the roistering with a career - best 63 , one stroke outside the course record set by Jose Maria Canizares last year , and Sweden 's Jesper Parnevik was only a shot behind after collecting eight birdies in 13 holes . England 's David Gilford had 65 while defending champion Ronan Rafferty from Ireland opened with a flawless 67 .

Thereafter , however , a series of self - inflicted wounds proved costly , the turning point coming when Scott Stewart 's long diagonal to Canada 's left touchline saw only Tony Stanger retreat into his 22 at suitable speed , though John Graf and Chris Tynan then got the better of him , the former 's delightful pick - up releasing the latter for a try .

"The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school — from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites . We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff . An early rule of thumb became ‘ if the nursery nurses do n't do it , neither do we’ . We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life , and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was ‘ age appropriate’ by looking at the nursery nurses ( incorrectly and naïvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought ! ) . This mechanism ended in total failure when , after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights , short socks , mostly white , suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building .",0

What was true on the wider front was also true at a personal level : Layton was about to go into his most prolific period of writing , and the whole literary scene was being galvanised into a productivity never before realised in Canada .",0
"By the end of 1337 Edward had committed himself to spending £ 124,000 on his allies , and his parliamentary grants would bring in only about £ 38,000 a year . In July 1338 Edward crossed to Brabant and established himself at Antwerp . There was no organized campaigning throughout that year , and Sir Thomas Gray , who took a dim view of the conduct of the war , complained that Edward did nothing at Antwerp except ‘ jousting and leading a jolly life’ . The real problem was the mobilization of resources : Edward experienced difficulty in collecting revenue in England , and relations between the king 's advisers in Brabant , chief amongst whom were the Earl of Salisbury and the Earl of Northampton , and the council in England , dominated by the clerical ministers of state , gradually deteriorated . Not until September 1339 did Edward feel able to move .",0

"The effect on the demography of the inner cities could be dramatic , as migration into and out of inner cities is in any case already high . Since housing is also crucial to mobility , the break - up of local authority control of low - income estates is also part of the package of reforms . Reports that the numbers registering on the electoral rolls are falling ( Weekend World , 11 October 1987 ; the Independent , 23 February 1988 , p. 6 ) indicate that the political arithmetic will also play its part . If some of those who resist and resent the imposition , opt out of the electoral system ( and the calculation is that these will be those who are thought , either now or in the future , likely to benefit from the present array of public services ) , while others are more inclined to vote at local elections for a party which offers to cut and reorganize services , the electoral outcome would be dramatic . Michael Howard , then a Minister at the Department of the Environment , reported an opinion poll as having found that one - quarter of people who had not previously voted in local elections intended to vote in future as a result of the community charge ( interview on This Week , Next Week , 21 February 1988 ) .",1

"Some early petitions in 1788 to the Commons on the slave trade came from county meetings held in customary county meeting places . At these gatherings only freeholders ( including gentry and clergy ) were allowed to speak and vote ; they were usually summoned by the sheriff on the application of a number of freeholders and the county members might often attend . These meetings had a constitutional if non - statutory status and their use by abolitionists , far from opening the democratic floodgates , put the authority of precedent and the county elites behind them . Some other meetings in 1788 in corporate towns extended beyond local officials but were not open and general ; yet other gatherings were restricted to membership of particular denominations . Drescher , however , has demonstrated that there were at least twenty - seven public meetings for anti - slave trade petitioning in 1788 .",0

"The regulation of aviation comprises many different activities but perhaps the most significant is the drawing up of a set of rules and regulations and the establishment of an organisation to ensure their enforcement . The regulatory body is also a licensing authority in respect of a wide range of activities . Pilots and other flight crew immediately come to mind ; so too do maintenance engineers and air traffic controllers . In addition , these authorities license airports to ensure that they comply with their national interpretation of ICAO standards , and they also issue certificates of airworthiness for types of aircraft and in respect of each individual aircraft on their register , besides monitoring aircraft design and manufacturing standards . Another substantial undertaking by regulating authorities in most countries is the provision of an air traffic control service and the licensing of the air traffic control officers who operate the service .",0

"Such a definition involves the construction of categories within the general scope of the law and , though they may be widely drawn , is open to the same objection as a definition based upon the perceptions of solicitors . It tends to be exclusive rather than inclusive , in that our thinking may be confined to those matters which fall within accepted categories rather than accepting that all situations to which the law pertains can give rise to legal problems despite the fact that there is no immediately available legal framework for their solution . A definition of a legal problem as ' an unresolved difficulty to which the law is relevant , ' may appear to be far too vague and begging too many questions . However , it may form the basis of a new approach to problems in which lawyers and advisers will not seek to establish the legal nature of the problem and then find the relevant law , but will rather seek to establish the nature of the problem and then contemplate whether any part of the law might be relevant . Such a definition tries to indicate an approach , an attitude , rather than provide a litmus - paper test .",0

Fish demonstrate their aggression quite plainly and it is obvious when they do n't get along . The seemingly constant serenity of the invertebrate aquarium mirrors the harmony of the coral reef where masses of weird and wonderful creatures appear to live cheek by jowl quite happily together . Most are , after all , sessile non - moving creatures formed into an intricate tapestry of living organisms often closely interwoven with one another . A form of harmony therefore no doubt exists as the animals , fixed to one spot , have learned to make best use of their environment to carve their own small niches in exploiting the possibilities of their habitat to the full .",0
"One reason why the Egton Bridge Show not only survived but is , in fact , growing is that being an isolated rural area , well away from any big industrial towns , there was not a mass exodus in the nineteenth century . Another is that as gooseberry growing is one of those traditions which are passed down from generation to generation , and fathers were still able to pass their bushes on to their sons . As Mr E Preston , chairman of the Egton Bridge Old Gooseberry Society said , ‘ Once it is in your blood , it just keeps going’ . With the increase in the number of people having their own transport , those who have left the area are able to return for the show . Of course the type of soil in the area plays an important part in good gooseberry growing , and the good heavy loam of Egton Bridge is ideal as it retains vital moisture .",0

Taylor was an engineer by training and his approach to understanding organisations reflected both his scientific background and the belief in science as the solution to society 's problems that was so characteristic of the late nineteenth century . Taylor ( 1967 ) examined the traditional working methods of individual workers in a number of studies covering such simple tasks as bricklaying or shovelling materials . He believed that it was possible to apply scientific principles to each task which would replace the old rule - of - thumb method of working . He believed that the workforce should be selected on the same scientific basis . Such an approach would lead to a more efficient worker and hence to a more profitable organisation .,0

"Some schools saw the development of study skills in a similar fashion , perceiving skills as a prerequisite for satisfactory engagement with subject content or learning experiences . Some change is perceived as being effected within the curriculum itself , however conceived , as in the case of the introduction of new subjects to the timetable . However , to distinguish changes perceived in this way from extra - curricular or infrastructural developments begs the question of what constitutes "" the curriculum "" in the first place . For the teacher who favours the process model , a development like study skills or reading for leisure would hardly be seen as extra to the curriculum , and for some , even the enhancement of the physical environment can not be divorced from those learning experiences in which education consists : that is to say , "" the medium is the message "" ( McLuhan cited in Postman and Weingarter , 1971 ) . For others , the medium is most certainly not the message , and the curriculum is more narrowly defined as that collection of bodies of knowledge which make up the subjects on the school timetable .",0

"The controversy is more pronounced in university libraries than in the UK polytechnics , where the emphasis is upon teaching rather than research , and where there are few special collections of the kind to be found in universities . Most universities differentiate undergraduate provision quite sharply by housing the best - used textbooks in short loan collections , where decisions upon duplication are based upon careful monitoring of loan statistics ( see pp.34–5 ) . It would be rare to come across policy statements which are explicit about the level of provision accorded to undergraduates vis - à - vis other groups , but some universities develop rule of thumb guidelines — for instance , a maximum number of copies for undergraduate texts , or ( commonly ) a rule restricting research material to single copies . Periodicals remain by far the most important research tool for academics , both for current awareness scanning and for chasing up citations to individual articles . In recent years most academic libraries have been forced to cut back on periodical provision , to prevent serials from running away with unreasonable proportions of their budgets for materials ( see pp . 135–8 ) .",0

"It has already been argued , in the previous chapter , that we all use oppositions to make sense of our experience . In any opposition , one of the pair is likely to be rated positively , and the other negatively : for example , masculinity and femininity , science and arts .

"Mainly , I think , because he finally established the explanatory power of functionalism ; he showed more clearly than any of his predecessors how much more profoundly we understand man 's social life when we see it in all its functional complexity . Earlier writers had given hints of the rewards that lay in store for those who followed this intellectual path . Durkheim opened the floodgates and offered what amounted to a radically new way of making sense of social institutions and their inter - relations . It is a measure of his success in launching this new functional approach that we now take it so much for granted that we forget , and even find difficulty in appreciating , the novelty which it represented at the time . That said , we must note that in common with so many other innovators , Durkheim 's insights can also be found to some extent in the works of others .",0

It is not as though academic social science has yet found a language that can address these problems that is not contentious .

"For both indices , they found significant positive correlation between the daily measures of volatility based on options prices and on the actual daily price relatives . This indicates that , using an alternative measure of volatility , the positive relationship between maturity and volatility remained , and the second measure of volatility also resulted in contradiction of the Samuelson hypothesis . Chamberlain ( 1989 ) used daily data on the high and low prices of the FT - SE 100 index futures contracts ending between March 1985 and March 1986 .

Such a move is opposed by the Serbs , who , although accounting for only one third of Bosnia 's population , have laid claim to more than two thirds of the republic 's territory .

"Its corollary , whereby praxis becomes determining history , he called the ‘ practico - inert’ , by which he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been created by previous praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis . The individual is thus both totalizer and totalized , deftly uniting freedom with necessity . Though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him , it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts , ‘ totalizations’ , can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality — rather than being the arbitrary , blind and self - cancelling movements of , say , Hardy 's immanent will . Sartre 's fundamental thesis , that ‘ History continually effects totalisations of totalisations’(I , 15 ) , does not in itself answer what Ronald Aronson has rightly characterized as the question for Sartre : ‘ how do separate , antagonistic actions yield a history ; how do individual totalizations lead to Totalization ( and also progress , the direction of history , its truth and its meaning)?’ For the whole basis of Sartre 's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law , ‘ some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind History like the will of God’ , but the continuously produced effect of individual conflicts ; each action is in its turn subsumed as a part of the whole in an ever broader , developing totalization ( I , 37 ) .",0
"Williams has said that the doctor is ‘ probably exempted from that duty if life has become a burden to the patient’ . There is no authority for these propositions , and a leading critic in the United States has taken a contrary view , as did the court in the case of The Application of the President and Directors of Georgetown College Inc. , holding that ‘ death resulting from failure to extend proper medical care , where there is a duty of care , is manslaughter.’ This obviously begs the question of when a duty exists . If necessary , I am content to rely on the propositions advanced by Elliott and Williams , although the words ‘ useless’ and ‘ burden’are not very helpful . I think the stronger point , however , is that the arguments to the contrary revolve around questions of voluntary euthanasia as opposed to the situation I am discussing .",0

There was a lot of ‘ this dear , dear land of ours’ , of ‘ the level evening sun over an English meadow’ , of ‘ the rooks tumbling noisily home into the elms’ , but there was also a good ringing pledge in which the ambiguity , although present , was neither obvious nor too clever by half . ‘ I give you my word’ , he said , ‘ that there will be no great armaments.’ A correspondent of The Times thought it was ‘ like the first hearing of a great symphony’ , and Harold Laski , never one to be outdone in either flattery or hyperbole , wrote to Baldwin that it was ‘ the greatest speech a Prime Minister has ever made’ .",0

"Steaks and chops retained their natural juices without drying out , and this was assessed as being because of the much shorter cooking time . Two whole racks of lamb cooked out to just pink perfection in under 15 minutes and gave a markedly superior eating quality , and a best method for roasting a 4 lb boned lamb averaged out over all tests with remarkably only an 8 per cent weight loss . As a general rule of thumb , darker meats and large joints benefit from a lower microwave power level than full . This was borne out by the tests on ‘ bootiful’ Norfolk turkeys which needed an hour at half microwave power to cook right through without drying the breast meat .

"Quirk et al . 1985 : 1206 ) . While it is true to say that the bare infinitive is more frequent in American English — Algeo ( 1988 : 22 ) found that the Brown University Corpus has only 25 per cent usage of to infinitives after help where the Lancaster - Oslo / Bergen Corpus has 73 per cent— this begs the question nevertheless because both the bare and the to infinitives are used on both sides of the Atlantic . This means that the problem of whether they can be used to make distinctions of meaning is a real one and must be addressed , instead of merely alleging geographical distribution as the explanation for infinitival usage with this verb . This is all the more requisite as there are certain uses in which the to infinitive can not be substituted for the bare form ( e.g. ( 13 ) ) and , vice versa , where the bare infinitive can not replace its counterpart with to , as in ( 14 ) .",0

"1 Kings 6ff ) . At this central sanctuary there was no place for female officiants as the Temple 's affairs were regarded as the sole responsibility of an organized , hereditary male priesthood dedicated to the service of Yahweh . But despite all efforts , worship of the old gods and goddesses continued throughout the land of Israel and even on occasion at the Temple of Jerusalem itself — as evidenced by the books of Kings and Chronicles , which refer to events of the seventh and sixth centuries . Ironically , Yahweh 's final victory came with the destruction of the Temple at the hands of the Babylonians in 587 BC . For generations prior to this calamity the custodians and promoters of Yahweh — that is , the now canonized Prophets of Israel — had been warning the people that if they did not abandon their syncretistic ways , the wrath of the one true God would descend upon them .",1

Only by the merest chance would a traveller through space happen upon the planet Earth ; a tiny jewel of a place , orbiting an unexceptional star in an ordinary galaxy , but — miracle of miracles — providing precisely those conditions , neither too hot nor too cold , nor too dense nor too sparse , where the astonishingly delicate processes of life can unfold . All this begs many questions . What is this elusive quality called ' life ' ? What forms does it take ?",0

US Open champion Tom Kite took a seven at the fourth , but Faldo swiftly obliterated Craig Parry 's three - shot overnight lead .

"When Ceauşescu 's chief intelligence adviser , Ion Pacepa , defected to the United States in 1978 , he claimed that Ceauşescu had been engaged in a long - term strategic plan codenamed ' Red Horizon ' . Its aim was to deceive the West and to obtain key political , military and technological secrets which he intended to share with the Soviet Union . Pacepa argued that Ceauşescu was hand - in - glove with Brezhnev and that the split between Romania and the Soviet Union was a deception agreed by both parties to cheat the West . Pacepa was not the first defector from the world of Soviet bloc secret services to make such a claim . At the very least , it says a great deal about the conspiratorial mentality which the leaders of the Communist system have created that so many defectors tend to see deception at work everywhere .",0

"Its first post - cold war opportunity has been President Bush 's occupation of Panama in December 1989 . It was a vision which had been enthusiastically supported by the Thatcher government in London . In this context , the current postwar peace proposals now being advanced in Western capitals are merely the icing on the global security cake . The basic concern has been to demonstrate that regimes , such as that in Iraq , can no longer threaten this new dispensation of global power . The new system is to be sustained by a single super - power which , even if officially bankrupt , can still call on the financial resources of its wealthy clients and allies to support its global security activities .",0
"Other researchers have claimed that some of Schmidt and Hunter 's estimates of savings are too high . Increased productivity can also mean increased costs , and the costs of selection are incurred before the savings are made , so interest charges need to be included . Also , employers are constantly employing new staff so the return on selection has to be calculated over a longer period of time to get a true picture of the effects of selection methods . Although these initial estimates are somewhat crude , either way the available results strongly suggest that use of a valid selection test can contribute susbstantially to an organisation 's profitability . In conclusion , research over eight decades has demonstrated the predictive validity of ability tests to be high , or certainly much higher than an interview .",0

"From what you know or have heard about each one , can you say whether you are generally satisfied or not satisfied with the service that each one provides ? Preliminary analysis of these questions suggested that dissatisfaction with six of the organizations was importantly related to preparedness to break the law : the press , local government , the civil service , banks , the police and the local doctor . A scale was formed by simply scoring the number of times the respondent said that he or she was satisfied ; the resulting scale started with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 6 , but it was dichotomized at the median value into a scale of political alienation with two values ( high and low ) . Figure 13.9 shows the cross - tabulation of preparedness to break the law by alienation by experience of unemployment . Those who are alienated from the institutions of authority and the state are certainly more prepared to break the law than those who are not ; among those who have been unemployed , the effect is + 0.140 , and among those who have not it is + 0.171 , an average effect of + 0.155 .",1
"The pressures were money and patents , and how the competition of the market place can interfere with the more detached quest for truth in the laboratory .

How did the news media , scientists and governments take on board a claim that made no sense within the laws of physics , was based in part on wrong data and that was shown to be flawed within days of the announcement ? With such lack of evidence , how did administrators decide it was worthwhile to pour millions of dollars of taxpayers ' money into this fanciful fusion fiasco ?",0

"His only concern was quite what officials will make of his wound when he appears as a witness at Jedburgh Sheriff Court today . Some of the brightest moments in the game stemmed from forwards and backs in blissful unison , fully exercising the courageous Welsh defensive repertoire : Derek Stark , one felt , might have done rather better with his chance in the second minute , created by Peter Wright 's lineout tidy , midfield linkage and Gavin Hastings ' incision . Evans made the saving tackle , just as he did when Tony Stanger , having barn - stormed out of Wayne Proctor 's tackle , threatened to bring the house down in a move created by Craig Chalmers ' adroit collection of Mike Rayer 's kick , the irrepressible Armstrong arcing out of harm 's way on a touchline blast and the thumping support of Cronin and Kenny Milne ( one tighthead to the good ) . Stanger also quite magnificently clawed down Proctor after he had been uncorked in his own 22 by the largely negative Neil Jenkins ( who had two goal - kicking failures ) , Rayer and Ricky Evans having capitalised on a Scottish attack short - circuiting . Andy Reed 's lineout provision had created that chance and the Bath lock could prove a real dark horse for the Lions given his sterling deeds at restarts , a superb chopping of Mike Hall , a dive pass from a ruck and his arrival in the burn - out of Gavin Hastings ' break which required more last - gasp heroics , this time from Stuart Davies , to prevent a try .",0

Elizabeth 's famous Armada speech —'I know that I have the body of a weak and feeble woman , but I have the heart of a king and a king of England too ' — and Mary 's much - quoted desire to live the life of a soldier , wearing a Glasgow buckler and sleeping under the stars , are testimony to one ( it is perhaps worth adding that the context for Elizabeth was fighting Spain , for Mary fighting her half - brother ) . Their different solutions to the question of marriage , neither of which was in any way adequate , are witness to another , even more serious . Yet there are two reasons why Mary 's sex will not explain her failure and downfall .",1

"By far the most spectacular was Shelter Stone Crag , a tapering white spire rising nearly 1000 feet immediately behind the bivouac . After a brew we walked to its foot and to our delight discovered that the covering on the lower slabs was not powder as we had suspected , but acres of perfect névé and climbable anywhere . After playing happily on it for a while we romped back to our sleeping bags and a meal , excited at the prospect of getting to grips next morning with the classic grade V , Sticil Face . The night was thoroughly miserable . It proved impossible to block the jets of spindrift which sought us with every gust of the noisily strengthening wind and settled on our Gore - Tex bivvy - bags , making them ineffective unless constantly shaken clear .",0
"However , none of the scaled - up versions of the models on test could survive the strength of the waves whose energy they sought to exploit and the conclusion reached was that the modifications needed to make them sufficiently strong would render them cost uncompetitive . It was therefore recommended that no more money be spent on wavepower which has been largely abandoned , in the UK at least , though some work still continues . Tidal schemes have the advantage of regularity , an integrated electricity system could organise itself according to high and low water . Tidal power systems operate by filling a single basin or river estuary at rising tide through sluice gates then emptying it during falling tide through turbines . There are , in fact only a limited number of sites in the world with sufficient tide range to make such schemes cost effective .",1
"The next day , Dr Ralph Shaw publicized Richard 's claims to the throne in a sermon at St Paul 's Cross . The justification for Gloucester 's assumption of power confused contemporaries and has continued to arouse controversy . The fullest version of Gloucester 's arguments is to be found on the parliament roll of January 1484 and purports to be the petition presented to Gloucester when he was asked to take the throne in June . It is , however , doubtful whether this genuinely represents the ideas circulating in 1483 . The 1484 act is scathing about the misrule of Edward IV :",1

"He may , for instance , have a general belief that the woman 's wishes in sexual matters are immaterial , so that in a specific instance he does not bother either to enquire or to think about them .

"‘ And it was so windy the tent nearly blew away!’ ‘ Some of the tasks were very difficult’ The task did n't stop here — Fiona also had to write up a detailed log of the trip , complete with samples , photographs and complex scientific data showing when the river had high and low tides and why it flowed in a certain direction .

"CHAPTER 5 Lear 's Years of Misery EDWARD LEAR , famous for his watercolour landscapes and nonsense rhymes , began his career at the age of 16 under a cloud of poverty and insecurity as a draughtsman to the Zoological Society . With a hopeless head for finance and a desperate desire to befriend , Lear was only too willing to receive the attentions of John Gould , then in his mid-20s , and to initiate him into the secrets of the new technique of lithography and the art of ornithological illustration . It was Lear 's example that provided the impetus for the Goulds ' first publication , and it was Lear who later transformed Gould 's static and unimaginative style into the confident and innovative work that characterised his second and all subsequent publications .",0

"Around 38 % of shops currently stay open on a Sunday . Under the ‘ Keep Sunday Special’ option , which would keep most big shops shut , this would fall to just 5 % . There would be a rise of some 20,000 in the number of retail jobs — because more small shopkeepers could make ends meet — but shopworkers ' average annual wages would fall by £ 170 , for they would miss out on higher Sunday pay - rates . A more liberal choice proposed by the Shop Hours Reform Council — allowing large shops to open for up to six hours on a Sunday , and small ones for as long as they wanted — would encourage almost half of all shops to do so . Shop - workers ' wages would rise by £ 50 a year , but there would be 5,000 fewer of them than there are now .",0
"The Magna ~ Charta is the world ’s most visible statement of principles for the promotion and protection of university autonomy .

"7.2.2 Biotic factors Among seven species of fruit pigeons in tropical Queensland , the diets of the birds change with the seasonal fruits , each species with a different suite of plant species . Coexistence is reinforced by nomadism and migration , but the diets overlap at times of both high and low fruit availability . Indeed , of the biotic explanations of how existing plant species avoid competition , some are based on time - sharing of animal agents . For example , over a season , six species of Shorea are visited in turn by species of thrips , which are believed to be their major pollinators .",1

"They are imperfect players in an imperfect democracy ; and they are there , from time to time , to write and investigate things that the closed worlds of the British professions would grind their teeth over . A truly free press is a press which irritates and infuriates along the way .

"In practical terms this is translated into the maxim ‘ get it in the bucket’ , a rule of particular importance in ‘ one - off’ rather than continuing pollutions , since there may only be one chance to sample . Besides , as field staff said , ‘ you can always throw it away later’ if the pollution turns out to be unimportant and the officer wants to avoid the trouble of processing , that is , bureaucratically accounting for , his sample . In general , wherever the officer believes a case to be one which may come to his supervisor 's knowledge , it is appropriate to err on the side of caution , to ‘ go by the book’ and protect himself from criticism . He becomes , in effect , more willing to define cases as ‘ pollutions’ since the agency has grounds for complaint only when an officer fails to take action in an instance which officially warrants it — not the other way round .

"Solid modelling thus allows the domain handling approach to be extended from the initial gross object definition level right down to the elemental description of local geometry by use of primitives . The same basic processes can be applied throughout , with the final level of operation chosen automatically by the bounding requirements of the specified investigation .

"Not surprisingly , some saw these victories as signs that the days of the mounted knight as the dominant military arm were coming to an end . Yet care must be taken not to dismiss too readily the value of cavalry as an arm — or worse , as a relic — of the past .

None the less , as has been argued , the Hundred Years War would never be settled by a major engagement in which the cavalry alone played the decisive role . It is important to recognise this , for an acceptance of this fundamental point leads more easily to an understanding of the reasons which caused an increase in the military significance of those who did not fight on horseback .",1

"Despite greasy conditions which made handling difficult , Aussie full - back Gary Jack again proved an inspiration — sparking the first try after 20 minutes . He raced 50 yards up the right before the ball was swept left for David Plange to dive over . Mark Aston added the touchline kick to his earlier penalty — and then turned the screw with a drop goal . Just before half - time prop Craig O'Brien rounded off some brilliant Hull KR handling to give the 2,844 crowd something to shout about , Mike Fletcher adding the goal . But Eagles sub Hugh Waddell set up a try for winger Mark Gamson after 58 minutes , and loose forward Tony Farrell went in from 20 yards to confirm their superiority .",0
"A reasonably quiet game , this is especially good for older children and may even be used by adults . As the children arrive , give them a pencil and paper and ask them to join one of three or four groups . Each group has a word such as'measurements ' or ' recommendations ' , and the object is to see how many other words can be made out of this . At the end of , say , five minutes read the lists out . For younger children , an adult may need to be sponsored as the leader of the group .",1
"Such people deserve legal protection . They deserve a role in our society that gives them a little more economic security and social dignity than is offered by the current outrageous employment practices .

The’ Breadline Britain’report quotes the words of a Liverpool housewife in a low - wage family .

"If the same anticorrelation can be applied to the longer - term decline in the Sun 's diameter , it may provide a clue to the dearth of sunspots during the height of the Little Ice Age , 300 years ago . Then the Sun 's angular diameter was about two thirds of a second of arc greater than it is today . And as the icing on the cake , Gilliland also reported a smaller , but clearly present , fluctuation in solar size which ties in with the 11-year sunspot cycle . The periodic variations are unambiguous . As for the longer - term decline in solar diameter , the discovery that started the whole ball rolling , Gilliland was cautious in his claims .",0
"A traveller reaching the edge of the escarpment is ‘ surprised and delighted to behold , extended like a map beneath him , a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through … Here , in the valley , the world seems to be constructed on a smaller and more delicate scale ; the fields are mere paddocks , so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark - green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass … such is the vale of Blackmoor.’ So it is described in Tess of the d'Urbervilles , yet , seen from the downs , it is The Woodlanders , Hardy 's own favourite story , which first comes to mind . Somewhere below , among orchards and woods , lay that sequestered spot which the topographers thought they had found all those years ago . Even now , cycling idly along the lanes in the lee of the downs , it is possible to speculate about such things in a whimsical sort of way ; a rare tranquility which pervades everything brings about that state of mind .",0

"The Westport Parish Committee issued a leaflet on the issue claiming that Des Burke had ‘ admitted that they had no plan for the way in which the rehabilitation of the mine site’ would be funded . Later that month , the Archbishop of Tuam delivered a sermon in which he came out against the mining . Calling Croagh Patrick ‘ the foundation mountain for Irish Christians’ he compared tunneling into it with ‘ digging deep into the history and religious sensibilities of our people’ , since the 1,500 year link between the mountain and St. Patrick involved ‘ an incomparable accumulation of spiritual wealth’ . MEG took part in the annual pilgrimage by erecting a marquee at the foot of the mountain where they displayed an exhibition of contrasting photographs of Mayo now and the aftermath of mining in Avoca and elsewhere in Ireland . They also used loudspeakers to address the pilgrims and collected thousands of signatures on a petition against mining from the crowd , estimated at over 40,000 .",0

"The decision here will depend on whether or not you want to be able to watch broadcast TV . ( c ) Colour or black and white ?

"French composers of the period , with one exception , were firmly closed to outside influences . They had found their own solution to the humanist problem of mating music with words in musique mesurée , the influence of which lingered on although it was no longer practised with doctrinaire thoroughness , and the air de cour with lute accompaniment flourished to the near exclusion of polyphonic song , though some of the published lute airs were obviously based on polyphonic originals . The heterogeneity of French solo song at the beginning of the century is shown by the six books of Airs de différents autheurs published by the lutenist Gabriel Bataille ( 1575–1630 ) during 1609–15 ; each book consists partly of his own compositions , partly of airs de cour and psalm - settings by Pierre Guedron ( d. 1621 ) , Le Jeune 's successor as Compositeur de la chambre du Roi , Guedron 's son - in - law Antoine Boesset ( 1586–1643 ) , the elderly Mauduit , and others . Boesset continued this series of lute Airs down to 1632 as well as reviving the four- or five - part airs de cour in nine books from 1617 to 1642 . They range in style from genuine musique mesurée ( Guedron 's ' Lors que Leandre ' ) , through songs influenced in greater or lesser degree by it ( e.g. the same composer 's ' Heureux qui se peut plaindre ' ) , to light melodious chansons , ballet airs , and dramatic recits like those composed for the court ballets .",1

"But Chapman 's team - building made Arsenal the favourites . Contrary to normal practice , ' the most discussed football official of recent years ' , as the Daily Mail described him , had his team training at Highbury in the week before the final , rather than at a country or seaside resort ( Brighton was later to become the favoured Cup training ground ) . ' The men are not deviating by one hair 's breadth from the ordinary system of training , ' he told the Daily News . ' To alter that system , even for a Cup final , would be folly , and for that reason we think there is no place like home and Highbury for keeping the minds and bodies of our players in perfect tune .

"But it was generally thought that the disposal of a children 's hearing would not be treated as a conviction . A child may appear before a hearing for reasons other than offences ; and he will have a disposal tailored to his needs for care rather than to the seriousness of the offence ; and a child may not only be put under a supervision requirement for reasons other than an offence , but he may remain under such a requirement for a period of years for reasons completely unconnected with breaches of the criminal law . In short , it was thought by many that the nature of the children 's hearing system would make it unnecessary to enact rules for ‘ wiping the slate clean’ . However , insofar as it purports to strengthen that belief , the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act is to be welcomed . The sad aspect of the Act is that people connected with the children 's hearing system — people certainly not lacking in intelligence or application — have been unable to unravel the mysteries of the statute .",0

"In a sense , they do not help our cause . Those who care for ‘ ordinary’ old people learn much about the courage and competence which so many display ; they discover that it is their ordinariness which is remarkable — their determination to carry on with the daily business of life , often in the face of considerable difficulties . Two examples , in particular , come to mind . Many old people have a severe degree of physical disability , of which rheumatism and arthritis top the lot for pain and discomfort . Perhaps everyone who works with such old people needs a period of physical disability ( real or ‘ pretend’ ) to see just what effort goes into the daily round and the strategies which are adopted the better to cope and to preserve independence .",0

"Among archivists and manuscript curators , it is an essential principle to explain the provenance of the documentary sources and preserve their integrity in such a way that each reader may draw his / her own conclusions with the minimum of interference . But how , with an electronic document , do you discern its origins , whether it is the work of more than one hand , how much altered from an original first draft , and so on ? From my own work , one particular parallel comes to mind . I once spent many months as a student using the papers of Francis Place , the radical reformer of early nineteenth - century Westminster .

How fortunate we are — uniquely — to have this hardy annual event reappearing with each New Year . The Five Nations Championship is understandably the envy of the rest of the rugby world and what spice will be added to the coming encounters — notably when England travel once more to Murrayfield on the opening day and return to Paris in February ; when Ireland , so nearly conquerors of champions Australia , run out once more at Lansdowne Road , and Wales begin their brave attempt to rise like some Phoenix from the ashes . The excitement beckons — and I 'll go no further at this stage than to wonder whether the Championship record of exactly 100 years ago might be repeated in 1992 , when England beat Ireland , Wales and Scotland ( just ! ) , Scotland beat Wales and Ireland ( just ! ) and Ireland beat Wales .",0

"More particularly , his sense that his calling as a monk , far from being incompatible with preaching to pagans , positively required it , owes much to the Gregorian influence . Pope Gregory ( 590–604 ) had sent Roman monks to the English . His writings , particularly his Homilies on Ezechiel , composed while he was pope , show that he thought the contemplative life of monks would be best validated if it bore fruit in action . Of the two wives of Jacob , whom spiritual writers regarded as the biblical types of the contemplative and active lives , Rachel was beautiful , but Liah was the fertile one .

A theatre annual for 1791 , extolling the fine orchestra ( under La Houssaye ) of the new Italianate Theatre de Monsieur , claims that French ensembles ‘ want to be reassured by a donkey - stick [ guideâne]’ But these are shafts on behalf of Italian opéra as a whole , trading on memories of Rousseau 's ridicule and the mere fact that the Opéra was directed by a conducteur . 1755 to 1781",0

"But the shape and layout of a house is not entirely conditioned by such things . The choice of items of furniture and equipment , and their arrangement within rooms , is more likely to be related to work carried out in the home , to the use of the home as a place for leisure and entertainment , or to its value as a symbol of status in society . By comparing objects in museums with those mentioned in inventories or seen in old drawings and photographs , we expect to get a fuller picture of domestic life in Scotland than we can find in any one source alone . This will be made more complete with the help of archaeologists , architectural historians , furniture specialists , social historians and others .

"The weakness of shareholder control results , in short , from the ‘ logic of collective action’ : while the shareholders as a group would benefit if their rights of control over management were exercised , it is rational for the members individually to remain passive . It is unlikely that voting by a single shareholder will make much difference to the success of a resolution either way , and so it is not worthwhile for shareholders to evaluate proposals put to the general meeting . They will do better either to abstain from voting , or to vote with management as a low cost ‘ rule of thumb’ . It is true that the shareholders would make an impact if they were to agree to vote in the same way , but this will usually involve the costs of educating and obtaining the co - operation of other shareholders being borne by individual activist members , and these are likely to outweigh the benefits that will be captured by them , since any increase in the value of the company attributable to intervention will be distributed among the shareholders as a whole . The state of shareholder inactivity that results from these factors , it is argued , enables managers to pursue objectives of their own choosing .",0

"The argument attacks the position that Marxism is crudely materialist in regarding theoretical , political and ideological practices as determined by the economic base . Apart from the inherent implausibility of this claim , Althusser argues that if Marx were to defend it he would be vulnerable to the very criticism which he made of classical economy . For just as Marx , when faced with the problem ‘ How does man make his history?’ replied with another question , ‘ How is the man who makes history made?’ , so the proposal that the economic organisation of a society determines its superstructure should prompt us to ask how the base itself is determined . The parallel between these questions is , in Althusser 's view , matched by Marx 's answers . Just as Marx criticised the suggestion that we could found a theory on universal human needs , he now rejects the idea that we can introduce an independently defined notion of economic practice and use it to explain other aspects of society .",0

"The Democratic leaders insist that the cut is an unwarranted giveaway to the wealthy which will have no significant effect on the economy and deepen the deficit .

Some pundits suggest that the capital gains tax battle is a shrewd White House softening - up exercise for an even more aggressive assault on the Democratic leaders in the next two to three weeks , designed to force a 1990 deficit - cutting agreement on Republican terms .

"I have , however , pointed out that there are things like nautical charts , voyage systems , harbour regulations etcetera etcetera which is a form of management albeit self management .

Now I have considerable respect for the House of Commons ' Environment Committee but I think on this occasion they must have been tired and emotional when they wrote that . The point of issue is that estuary and coastal zone management is a reality and what seems to be happening is all sorts of different plans are popping up on various estuaries and Geoff knows them well now because he 's been involved with the one on the Stour and Orwell and what is happening is that these are starting at local level so the first contact with sailors may be from a local authority or someone at local level .

"An Arab 's flowing robes and racing camels gleamed white against the ochre dirt .

"Successful dig — both rabbit and ferret are in sight . An enlargement of the hole reveals the ferret in action . A blockage can also occur when two rabbits come face to face in a hole of small diameter .

It simply scraps away at the rabbit 's hindquarters but a rabbit can sit out this sort of treatment for quite long periods before feeling any need to react .",1

"The situation where one French machinegun section found itself holding a hole in the front two hundred yards wide with its two machine guns for several days in complete detachment from the rest of the army , was by no means unique . To add to this demoralising sense of isolation , the tenacious curtain of smoke from the bombardment meant that the front line frequently could not see the supporting troops behind ; nor , worse still , could their rockets of supplication asking for the artillery to bring down a barrage , or cease shelling their own positions , be seen at the rear . Countless were the true heroes of Verdun , fighting small Thermopylaes in the shell - holes , who remained unsung and undecorated because no one witnessed their deeds .

"Having become a Whip in the Asquith coalition , Bridgeman told Maxse in July 1916 : do n't obsess yourself with the idea that none of them ( Unionist MPs ) understand the view of the man in the street … there is plenty of soundness in the party inside the House … and , easy as it is to call everyone inside Parliamentarians , and to assume that everyone outside are the only judges … you will have to get inside before you realize the difficulties of the situation , or the value of the cool - headed men who still represent the Unionist party in the House , and remain independent of Cabinet influence … To dismiss this comment simply as Bridgeman being a poacher turned gamekeeper would be to miss the point , which is that the war had allowed the Conservatives to become gamekeepers again , whereas from 1902 to 1914 there had been genuine concern that they might be permanently banished from the estates of power . Bridgeman 's remark was thus symptomatic of renewed Conservative confidence . With the party having re - entered the corridors of power through a side door , and with the Liberals beginning to divide over the conduct of the war , the Conservatives’ prewar fears had been dissipated .",0

After that , age got the better of him , and both he and his efforts to modernise Egypt languished . Mohamed Ali had both established the last of the numerous alien dynasties to rule Egypt and begun to lay the groundwork for a modern state on European lines .

"There were large variations in the systems ( Pahl , 1989 ) used by the households both to manage and control their income ( see Gillian Parker 's chapter here ) .

Consequently , they had the worry of juggling finances and trying to make ends meet .

It has gradually come to be accepted that there are no clear lines dividing normal and abnormal behaviour , only several continua on which people might be placed that shade very gradually from the recognizably normal to the clearly disturbed .

Do keep the press informed of events which provide photo opportunities — Easter bonnet parade , pancake race , the school 's celebration of its 50th birthday etc .

Both were aged 61 and were retired . Mr James had to pay to swim but his wife got in free because the local council who ran the centre had a policy that anyone of state pension age did not have to pay . Mr James claimed that this was unlawful sex discrimination and his case went all the way to the House of Lords . The decision was that it was unlawful direct discrimination because Mr James had been treated differently than if he had been a woman . The importance of that case in the employment context can be seen in the following example .,0

"And customers are equally reluctant to pay a premium for knobblier — but ideologically and chemically purer — fruit and vegetables , or for meat and poultry from organically reared livestock . As a result , neither side benefits from the effort put into organic farming . According to the Soil Association — the largest body of organic farmers , of which Tustian is a member — although sales of organic produce have increased overall because there is more of it in the shops ( much of it imported ) , the recession also means that some of it lingers on the shelves for longer . Since organic farming is more costly than its chemical cousin , by the time the food reaches the shops it can seem excessively expensive . But in a welcome departure from the impersonal world of the supermarket , with its individually cling - filmed organic vegetables , the farmer and shopper will soon come face to face .",1
"Letterman had previously told me that flashback is a device which must be used sparingly , yet now he was a plausible advocate for this treatment . It appeals to me , too . The final , defiant round - up by the retreating Nazis , in which Claudia and her deluded father were caught , the train journey and the selection process at Auschwitz , will all be treated in black and white , in order , if I get Letterman , to increase the realism and to reduce the melodrama . I can see that his aim is to make these scenes so powerful that they will go beyond any fictional treatment of the death camps that has ever been tried before : the train roils through the night , the outcome , although certain , appallingly delayed by the shots of the iron wheels and the crude pistons ; the final scene of the five chimneys pouring their shameful smoke over the polish countryside , intercut — this is my contribution — with the smoke rising from the savannah . Letterman confided to me after one of our tennis games that my pieces in Manhattan had always struck him as somewhat trivial — artifices — until he read my piece ‘ Drancy , Ante - chamber of Death’ .",0

"The General and Municipal union concentrated on casuals , seasonals and fixed - term contract workers , on part - timers and even on the self - employed ; the Transport and General union on the same categories of temporary worker , on part - timers , and even on agency workers . Special recruitment drives have been organised , "" model agreements "" governing when and under what conditions temporary workers might be used , and "" casual workers "" charters ' have been drawn up Some unions , notably the electricians , have gone further , establishing local registers of ( otherwise ) unemployed members from which employers have to draw when filling the temporary positions enterprise level agreements have permitted them to create . Whilst the unions ' attempts to regulate the use of the "" new "" temporary workers might prove successful , their attempts to organise "" traditional "" temporary workers seem much less likely to bear fruit . It is not only that in the past unions have not tried or wanted to recruit such workers ; temporary workers themselves have often had no real interest in being recruited . The attachment to work of many of them is rather marginal — itself intimately related to the fact that frequently their temporary jobs are also part - time jobs [ see Chapter 2 ] .",0

Too many Cooks did not spoil the travellers ' broth and by the end of the nineteenth century Cooks had offices across Europe and America , Australia and New Zealand , Canada , the Middle East and India . Such international fame and popular appeal guaranteed that the ubiquitous ' man from Cooks ' entered the English language , that songs about Cook 's tours were published and sung around the piano of the Victorian parlour and that Thomas Cook had a cocktail named after him — the Cooktail .

"More still needs to be learned about politics "" out - of - doors "" for the reigns of William and Anne ; in particular , we need to find out more about the ways local and national issues interacted in specific localities , and we are still in the process of discovering about the dynamics of electoral politics . It is clear , however , that political historians can not afford to confine their attention to the goings - on at Westminster or St James 's , and that the history of party under the later Stuarts is as much about the divisions that emerged in society at large as it is about what happened in Parliament or at the royal Court . Not only did the existence of a divided society help fuel party tensions under William and Anne , but taking the longer perspective covered by this book as a whole , it might even be fair to suggest that the emergence of the party divide amongst the political elite was itself a symptom of the bitter divisions that already existed in this society , divisions which we have traced back to the Restoration in 1660 . A wide range of factors shaped how people aligned themselves politically — from personal considerations or considerations of economic self - interest through to political or religious conviction — and the way these factors interrelated could differ over time to produce shifting patterns of popular allegiance . One theme that has emerged throughout this book , however , and which has been reinforced by the analysis presented in this chapter , is the importance of religion in determining people 's political identity .",1

"Linguists , psychologists and AI workers have theories about what procedures might select the right sense on the basis of sensible rules and reject the wrong one . However , it is plain that the speaker of English , although he performs this general task reliably thousands of times a day , has no idea whatever how he does it , and may well have a healthy scepticism about proffered accounts in terms of linguistic or other rules . Yet how can we get a picture of the way in which it is possible to accept both that a task is done by rules ( for it is certainly not done randomly ) and yet the performer has no access whatever to the rules ? Wittgenstein pointed out that no account is satisfactory that assumes that a human somehow surveys the alternatives and chooses one : ' It is as if I should say that the application of a word does not pass in one moment in front of my eye'(1964 : 15 ) . Yet it is not too hard to imagine how a computer parsing program might achieve some such effect : if we ask an English speaker how he does it , we may well get some reply like ' Well , I 'm simply looking for a sense of the word related to drinking , are n't I ?

Graeme Donald THE gentlemanly art of boxing has clouted so many expressions into common usage that it might be time to ' throw in the towel ' . Back in the days of bare - knuckle bouts the referee scratched a line in the dirt and fighters shaped up to each other by ' toeing ' this line . After a knockdown the fallen fighter had so many seconds to make it back to the starting stance and the less able were those who did n't ' come up to scratch ' . It was from these old fights that the boxing ring became square .,0

The one type of company which can totally dispense with the provisions of the Act relating to auditing of the accounts is a so - called ‘ dormant company.’ Under section 250 it is treated as dormant ‘ during a period in which … there is no transaction which is required by section 221 to be entered in the company 's accounting records ; and a company ceases to be dormant on the occurrence of such a transaction.’ The most obvious and common example of such a company is a ‘ shelf company’ while it remains on the shelf . But there may be legitimate reasons for incorporating a company which is intended to remain dormant indefinitely or for retaining on the register a company which for the time being has ceased to carry on business but which the members may wish to use at some time in the future for the same or some different business . A company does not obtain the exemption merely by being dormant .,0

"HARRY EYRES cautions about the practice of buying wine en primeur and advises on the recent form of the best Bordeaux châteaux Bordeaux has never had it so good . Polo parks ( one was constructed recently at Châteaux Giscours ) , marble bottling halls ( Michel Delon 's at Léoville - Lascases is so highly polished that workers have been issued with special boots ) , Versailles - style formal gardens with sunken cellars provide the spectacular icing on the cake of wealth accumulated by the leading châteaux over the last decade by the simple expedient of charging much more for their wines than it costs to make them . Nature , the global warming effect or a claret - loving god has contributed to Bordeaux 's boom by granting good - to - exceptional vintages in 1981 , 1982 , 1983 , 1985 , 1986 , 1988 and 1989 . Such a string of successes is unprecedented in the history of the region .",0

"When you 've done it you 're still left with the same vacuum inside you waiting to be filled . Your memory is a confusion of too many faces and places encountered too rapidly . Much better to dig your roots in somewhere — anywhere — and dig deep . Mark out some small area and cultivate it really well .

"My brief was to teach art and history of art to all age groups . I had no experience of teaching art to anyone , but the headmaster assured me that it simply involved giving the boys some paints to play with and then telling them to get on with it . He expressed the hope that my presence would ‘ give a boost to the standing of art history in the school’ , but unfortunately that wish was pie in the sky . Art classes were seen as ‘ free’ periods by the boys and any suggestion of serious work was unwelcome . My slide shows did go down reasonably well , if only because while the lights were out , they had the chance to change places under cover of darkness in the hope of confusing you know who .",0
"At home Keith is a naughty boy and frequently has breath holding tantrums to which his parents have responded by smacking and shouting at him . On one occasion they locked him in a bedroom and he threw a wooden brick through a window and tore down the curtains . He is clearly a very disturbed and emotionally rejected child because he deliberately urinates on the carpets and bedding , refuses to go to bed or stay in his own bed . His tempers at nighttime disturb Amy and also earn bangs on the wall from the irritated but otherwise kindly , elderly couple next door . Keith will play with Amy but woe betide her if she does not hand him toys , her food etc .",1
"The principle was one thing , the passenger quite another element in the rapid growth of what has become an international craze . For John Barker , a founding member of the British kite flying movement , and a prime mover among the paradropping enthusiasts like Jim Whitehouse and Greg Locke before him , there was no other possible passenger to harness into a parachute than that childhood and perennial favourite , the ‘ Teddy Bear’ . The universal appeal of the ‘ Teddy’ knows no bounds . We are , as we write , immersed in Bearaphanalia . The Top - selling hardback in the British book trade leading up to Christmas 1991 was Pauline Cockrill 's The Ultimate Teddy Bear Book and it had held its position among the top ten hardbacks for over two months .",0

"But there must be a point beyond which they can not go — some remaining ' self ' to which social scientists appeal . As this self is debated and discussed , the individualist sometimes seems to be demanding that a ceteris paribus clause should be included in all explanations of social phenomena — a murmured oath of loyalty to the freedom of the will along the lines of ' … and the individuals involved could have done otherwise ' . Such a clause would not bring the dispute between holists and individualists any nearer to a solution , however , since it begs the very question at issue . Nor would the dispute be of any great interest , because the explanatory role allotted to individual autonomy is so minimal . In order to sustain a more robust disagreement , individualist theorists must contend that human autonomy makes a substantial difference to the explanation of action , and stands in the way of the determinist account supposedly favoured by holists .",0

"Their first customer was Apple and this formed the basis of the relationship between the two companies — mainly forged by Steve Jobs , John Warnock and Chuck Geschke . Apple liked the idea so much that they invested a 20 % stake in Adobe making themselves the largest customer . What Adobe had done that had defeated virtually everyone else , certainly at the microcomputer level , was to build typefaces ' on - the - fly ' from outlines . Rather than store a bitmap of each character at every size it might be required , something that takes prodigious amounts of memory or disk storage , they used a single digital outline of the character and generated the required bitmap on demand . And these were n't any old typefaces , they were Linotype 's which meant that they conformed to the highest typographic standards the industry was likely to require .",0
"Often she had to work so hard to overcome her paralysing shyness that what she had to say burst out in a shout , or in a tone of great fierceness .

"The doctors were diverted into believing that it was related to my stomach . They did not refer me , and strangely I did not insist ; as patients do not want to hear bad news .

"And as to the over - imaginative way in which papers have so often treated her , she added simply : ‘ Because I 'm only young , and have lived such a short and normal life , they run out of things to say about me.’ Another theory comes from the serious Australian Magazine journalist Frank Robson . ‘ The attitude seems to be that as Minogue was ‘ invented’ by the publicity machine anyway , she 's fair game , no matter how flimsy or outrageous the angle . As a result some publications no longer deal in real information at all , except occasionally by accident.’ There is the last and as far as Kylie is concerned most convincing theory , that the stories are the product of small minded , talentless types who can never achieve fame in their own right .",0
"Though our screening method is semiquantitative , the seven unconfirmed cases did have creatine kinase values lower than those which were subsequently confirmed as increased on a later venous sample . Interestingly , five of these infants had some unusual perinatal features . One had been given intramuscular ampicillin for a septic cord ; one had had a traumatic caesarean birth ; one had had a difficult birth with vacuum extraction and he also had a ventricular septal defect ; one had a heart murmur ; and one had been premature and in a special care unit with hypotonia and jaundice . There is no evidence from any of the screening programmes to suggest that a transient elevation of creatine kinase activity in a neonate may lead to developing a muscular dystrophy in later life . All seven families with a transient result were interviewed to gain their perspective of the programme and ensure they had no lingering doubts about their sons ' health .",1

"Whose national interest , he does not say . Whether one tries to illustrate subsidiarity by an upturned pyramid or a spiked helmet is irrelevant : Sir Christopher 's definition makes it clear that , far from being a guarantee for decentralisation , ' subsidiarity ' is a blank cheque for more and more power to be transferred to Community level , just as the principle 's enshrinement in the German constitution has led to massive centralisation of power and expenditure in that country . The normal definition , that tasks will be executed at Community level only if they can not be satisfactorily dealt with at national level , begs the most important questions which can ever be asked in a democratic system : who decides ? how ? what for ? The principle is a principle for the allocation of competence within a hierarchy . This no doubt explains why it is so popular in disciplined societies where the government is bureaucratic , like Germany with its proportional representation .",0

"An EMC problem discovered as a product goes into production may cost hundreds of thousands of pounds in lost revenue as a result of the delay . Curing the problem at the design stage may only involve the addition of a component costing a few pence .

"To obtain the most accurate data possible , we measured data at two gain settings of the FAST detector : the MADNES parameters to control voltage settings on the camera and image intensifier were SETDET 7,1 at high gain and 3,1 at low gain . At high gain , about 40 % of the reflections were flagged as saturated and were discarded , while at low gain , weak reflections ( 3 standard deviations ) were discarded as unreliable . Data for all three wavelengths were scaled together using the program FBSCALE ; however , the high and low gain data were scaled separately . Scale factors were determined to bring these to a common and absolute scale , and to generate a merged set of amplitudes , but the high and low gain data were phased separately . However , the diffraction ratio for centric reflections , which should be zero theoretically , was 0.059 .",1

"To see the biblical renewal of liturgy successful in Europe , one still has to seek out certain churches . The greatest renewal is elsewhere . The Council 's encouragement in the field of Bible translation and inter - confessional co - operation ( DV 22 ) has borne abundant fruit . The key figure here was Cardinal A. Bea , the veteran biblical scholar whose experience and contacts fitted him uniquely to head the Secretariat for Christian Unity , to develop sensitive relations with both Christians and Jews , to bring all this manifold competence to the redrafting of Dei Verbum and the production of Nostra Aetate , and to foster the desired biblical renewal both pastorally within the Church and by ecumenical co - operation .

"A central storage and resource room reduces pressure for space in individual teaching rooms , but needs pre - planning and co - operation in order to have equipment available for specific lessons . In preparing particular sections or blocks of work for classes or groups of pupils which include visually handicapped children it can be useful to code in a mark when drafting the programme to indicate the need for a piece of specific equipment to be available , and check this quickly on a daily basis ( for example , closed circuit television tape recorder ; overhead projector ) . Materials and equipment less frequently used or too heavy for pupils to handle easily should be stored on upper shelves . Keeping braillers , typewriters and even magnifiers in their cases , or at least under covers when not in use , helps to maintain them in good condition , since dust and grime can cause damaged surfaces . Insistence on this in the early stages of use helps to make it become simply a good habit .",1

Early in the twelfth century a new tympanum was carved over the west door , showing the Last Judgement — welcoming visitors to horrific scenes of diabolical torture ; but also revealing , as doubtless the guides instructed the visitors with particular care , the heavenly hopes of the good , and especially of those who won the intercession of St Faith .

Tomorrow former Blue Peter presenter Mark Curry will be bounding around the same stage in frock and wig as Lord Fancourt Babberley in the centenary staging of the Brandon Thomas farce .,0
"They also have a ' stand by ' appointment scheme , where you can ring in at certain times at half an hour 's notice , where prices range from £ 4 to £ 7 . Men 's cut and blow dry is £ 8.95 . Perms range from £ 18.50 to £ 22.50 , not including cut and blow dry . Browns of Durham Cut and blow dry from £ 7.50 to £ 17 . Perms from £ 16 to £ 26 , not including cut and style .",1
"The organisers responded to the possible lifting of sporting restrictions on South Africa by reserving a place in the 24-team line - up when invitations were sent out in June this year . For several months the Hong Kong Sevens waited , hoping that the country 's two rugby bodies would unite as quickly as they had in some other sports — most notably cricket . But while their cricketing cousins were making history at the Calcutta Eden Garden pitch , rugby was still embroiled in the hard world of politics . With no hint that unification was soon forthcoming , the Sevens ' organisers sent their invitation elsewhere , and despite the absence of the Springboks , the April 4–5 tournament will still see some new faces . They may not be in the same class as the Springboks , but Namibia and Romania will be as heartily cheered by the tournament 's crowd when they make their appearances next year .",0

"A narrow gauge track ran along the platform surface , its polished rails carrying the 16 mm colour film camera and cameraman on a four wheeled dolly , pushed along by manpower and matching the pace of the train . East Lancs Railway driver Graham Thornton piloted the Class 40 , with Bury stationmaster Eric Allen as guard . Hidden in a hole in the platform was Gary Sutcliffe , with a 12 volt car battery feeding a home - made switching panel , from which he changed the aspects of the ex - BR colour light signal at the request of the film crew . This was for camera footage only , all train movements being subject to normal ELR operating rules . Other scenes depicting the inside of the ' moving train ' were actually shot inside Buckley Wells carriage sheds .",1
""" I know stories about heroes , stories about magicians , stories about birds and beasts , summer and winter , the sun , the moon , and the stars . "" The princess was very fond of stories , so she was eager to listen to the wise woman . "" Sit beside me on my carpet , then , and I will tell you about the golden apple and the nine peahens . "" But when the princess sat down beside her on the carpet , the wise woman snatched up her whip and lashed the carpet with it ; next minute they were far away , flying back to the king 's palace . And the king shut his daughter in a tower , lest she be stolen again .",1
"Comb Jelly feeding , tentacles in gut , Arctic What happens if you are run over by an iceberg ? If the iceberg is too big , you might find yourself trapped underneath a moving mountain , bumped and towed along with less and less of a choice of where to go . Following the safety line up to your guide boat seems to be the best possibility , but only if the line has not been cut on the sharp edges of the ice , or if the boat tender has not had to release the safety line to keep his boat from being capsized or dragged under the iceberg . Icebergs are notoriously unstable , and may flip over at the touch of a careless finger or the thump of a careless boot .",0
"And ‘ each’ and ‘ other’ . ‘ To’ as well . Maggie feels no doubt about that : so small a word , so small and so necessary a word is bound to survive , to slip through the net of destruction that she and Fenna — no , that she herself , alone — will loose on the cold sky tonight . But ‘ belong’— she is fearful that for her at least the word may explode , may vanish in a puff of smoke as delicate as the smoke that trickles from Fenna 's nostrils when he is asleep ; as delicate as the fronds of smoke that drift mysteriously from the end of Phoebe 's cigarette when she gestures impatiently in conversation . Maggie might no longer belong , to anything or anyone , if she did not belong to Fenna .",0

"Mr Kantor , before the Council of the Americas , gave a speech committing the administration to implementing a North American Free Trade Agreement by January 1st 1994 ; on the same day , he set out the administration 's determination to conclude the Uruguay round of the GATT by December . Why , then , is the administration so misunderstood ? Part of the reason is that , off - the - cuff , Mr Kantor has not yet learned to speak the language of trade buffs . On May 4th he said in answer to a question , as he has implied before , that he was an ' agnostic ' on free trade , protectionism , managed trade or anything ; all he wanted was an ' open world trading system ' . That ' agnostic ' , which sounded fair enough to Mr Kantor , could have carried an explosive charge across the oceans .",0

"The snag was that their accounting years often did not coincide with the April - March tax year . If a society 's year ended in , say , September , it passed on the tax the following January . So — the taxmen argued — in the new system , tax due on interest payments in the gap from October 1985 to April 1986 would get stuck in the society 's pocket . So special rules were made to deal with this . Unfair , cried the societies .",0
"Isaac avoided execution by promising the king a 10,000 mark fine , and in 1213 was transferred from Bristol to the Tower of London . But he may not have been released from the Tower until 1217 , when his remaining bonds were returned to him and he and the rest of the Jews of Norwich were given letters of royal protection . In his last years he featured in a number of important legal cases , and also became the subject of a famous caricature drawn on a tallage roll of 1233 . A rumour of his death circulated in 1230 , but he did not in fact die until late 1235 or 1236 . Isaac had two sons , Moses ( born before 1200 ) and Samuel ( born before 1204 ) , and a sister Margalita , who was active on her own account in 1201 .",1
"Any sunken area has to be taken up and relaid after ensuring that a firm foundation has been made . Edge restraint for this type of path is also important . Where the pointing needs renewing , the old pointing must be dug out as deep as possible as frost tends to lift shallow layers of cement . The new mortar should be mixed at one part cement to four parts sand . Make the mix fairly dry and press it well down into the joints , filling them right to the top and finishing them flush .",1
"In his victory speech he was gracious towards Brown and Tsongas voters , saying they were united with his supporters in wanting to oust Mr Bush . Mr Clinton compared the raucous New York campaign to a Coney Island roller - coaster with its ups and downs and twists and turns . Then , stretching a point , he declared : ‘ Now I 've been through it all , I have to admit I had a ball.’ He is the first Southerner to succeed in New York , and his aides were happily parodying the Sinatra song about the Big Apple : ‘ If we can make it here , we 'll make it anywhere.’ The hectic campaign schedule now takes a three - week breather until a big primary in Pennsylvania , followed in May and June by Ohio , several states in the South , and the West Coast states led by California .",0

"The fact that most of them already had criminal records was widely publicised and used as evidence of their guilt in the Chai Qing Feng case . The Guangming Daily had carried an article on 4 June , stating that , ‘ a gang of ruffians violently beat a Beijing University postgraduate to death.’ ( GMRB 4 . 6 . 1988 ) The case , it was said , was ‘ basically cut and dried’ , thus publicly condemning the six before they were even tried . Other newspapers carried similar articles in an effort to show to the Beida students that something was being done quickly about the case . After the speedy ‘ trial’ and a statutory appeal , which was dismissed , as is usual within a few hours , one of the six was executed and the others started long prison sentences .",0

"In abolishing the marital rape exemption , Parliament could presumably seek an undertaking that this be done from the Attorney General who has general superintendence over the discharge of the Director 's functions . Whether or not the D.P.P. is used as a handmaid to reforming legislation , it is most unlikely that the floodgates will be opened if the exemption is lifted . Certainly this has not been the experience in other jurisdictions . In California , Diana Russell found that ' it was almost exclusively wives who were extremely upset and who claimed great long term effects ' from marital rape who reported other acts of marital violence to the police , since the rape itself was not a crime .",0
"So primogeniture was not automatically accepted ; and where it was , it could create problems of a rather different sort . Heirs grew over - ambitious : both Baldwin V of Flanders and Geoffrey Martel the Younger rebelled against their fathers in an attempt to establish their own dominion ahead of time ; more problematically , princes had the headache of finding adequate endowments for their younger sons without infringing on the patrimony . But despite its drawbacks , primogeniture did offer a rule of thumb that commanded widespread respect . So the real difficulty remained in families where there was no direct heir , as the Angevin succession crisis of the 1060s proved . Perhaps a mature perception of this fact lay behind the rather surprising acquiescence of most Norman lords in William the Conqueror 's succession as duke in 1035 , though he was but a child and a bastard .",0
"Newcastle Utd 1 Portsmouth 0 THEY call him ' Ned ' Kelly . And , just like the Aussie original , Newcastle United 's number nine relishes nothing better than a backs - to - the - wall shootout . Nobody has responded more positively to Newcastle United 's desperate plight than the striker who drew blanks on the big stage with West Ham and huffed - and - puffed little more than powder puff stuff at Leicester . ' I love these type of games , ' said the 26-year - old Kelly , after his eighth goal in Keegan 's fifteen matches . A strike rate of just over one goal every two games is exceptional by any standards , even more so considering they have been scored in a struggling team .",0
"A toothless , gummy Firebird with no bite . The softgrained , ponderous opening sets the tone for a lifeless , long drawn out haul . Kitajenko encourages extremes of legato , usually at very slow tempi which make heavy weather of the opening sections , completely robbing the music of any momentum or atmosphere . When faster music does at last arrive for the ‘ Magic Carillon’ and the ‘ Infernal Dance,’its energy splutters ineffectually on the back burner . The orchestra is severely stretched to maintain any sort of cogent line , and the fantasy of the work is all but lost .",0
"We seemed to be peeing more than we could possibly have drunk . Stuart gave a little embarrassed cough , as if to say , ‘ Do n't know about you , but I 'm not even halfway there.’ It seemed the moment to enquire into the planned whereabouts of the hymeneal rough - and - tumble . But all I got in reply was a squinty smirk and the hiss of piss . ‘ No , really,’ I insisted a minute or so later , as I laundered my fingers and Stuart needlessly scraped a fetid plastic comb over his cranium , ‘ where are you going ?",0
"Due to start in March , the vehicle , dubbed ‘ Leopardcover’ , would be backed by the market 's central fund . Names on open years would , on payment of a premium meant to reflect commercial conditions , be granted unlimited cover for future liabilities . In the past Mr Coleridge is said to have sworn ( ‘ over my dead body’ ) that he would not countenance such a guarantee fund . But he later changed his spots enough to insist on Leopardcover as a condition of accepting the market 's chairmanship . Not that the new fund would come cheaply .",0
"Her lashes flickered . She paused , unnerved by the way he spoke and the words he chose .

"Within 6 months he excels at the art . To prove the point his shrimpfly caught the first salmon for 15 years when Kilmaurs Angling Club , of which he is chief fund raiser , visited a river near Crianlarich . Jim has since caught 6 more salmon in Ayrshire rivers on the same fly . The magazine ' Practical Game Fishermen ' has also recognised Jim 's expertise by awarding a £ 15 prize for his invention of a ' Dubbin Twister ' , a technical device to help with fly tying . The irony of it all is that Jim does not eat fish .",1
"To understand this point you should imagine ( or even actually perform ) your pronunciation of a sentence in a number of different ways : for example , if the sentence was ‘ I want to buy a new car’ and you were to say it in the following ways : ‘ pleading’ , ‘ angry’ , ‘ sad’ , ‘ happy’ , ‘ proud’ , it is certain that at least some of your performances will be different from some others , but it is also certain that the technique for analysing and transcribing intonation introduced earlier in the course will be found inadequate to represent the different things you do . You will have used variations in loudness and speed , for example ; almost certainly you will have used different voice qualities for different attitudes . You may have used your pitch range ( which was introduced in 15.3 ) in different ways : your pitch movements may have taken place within quite a narrow range ( narrow pitch range ) or using the full range between high and low ( wide pitch range ) ; if you did not use wide pitch range , you may have used different keys : high key ( using the upper part of your pitch range ) , mid key ( using the middle part of the range ) or low key ( the lower part ) . It is very likely that you will have used different facial expressions and even gestures and body movements . These factors are all of great importance in conveying attitudes and emotions , yet the traditional handbooks on English pronunciation have almost completely ignored them .",1
"The classic work on the subject is Pike ( 1948 ) , while more modern treatments are Hyman ( 1975 ) , pp . 212–29 and Katamba ( 1989 ) , Chapter 10 . 15.3 Many analyses within the British approach to intonation include among tones both ‘ high’ and ‘ low’varieties . For example , O'Connor and Arnold ( 1973 ) distinguished between ‘ high fall’ and ‘ low fall’(the former starting from a high pitch , the latter from mid ) , and also between ‘ low rise’and ‘ high rise’(the latter rising to a higher point than the former ) . Some writers have high and low versions of all tones .",1

"She had seen people like this . She had no confidence that time would bring with it inevitable growth : she grew by will and by strain . As a child , she was always deeply affected by the story of the sower who sowed his seeds , and some fell by the wayside , and some on stony ground and some fell among the thorns , and some fell upon good ground and bore fruit . This story was a favourite of the headmistress of her primary school , so she heard it often at Morning Prayers , and long before she could see it as a parable , she already felt shock before its injustice . The random scattering of seeds , and how much worse , of human souls , appalled her .",0
"You had to have legs like Marlene Dietrich to triumph over that get - up . She had an American boyfriend whom she was cultivating like mad and apparently he was so stunned by the first sight of Rosie 's straight grey legs and black feet pointing to twenty past eight that he took several photos of them with his expensive Leica camera , exclaiming joyfully , ' Oh boy ! I have to get a picture of those feet ! They 'll never believe this back home ! ' Rosie 's one ambition was to get to America , and the easiest way was to marry a Yank and become a GI bride .",1
"Car production and trade figures released today , highlight the difficulties that British manufacturers are having in selling their products overseas .

"The latter are the cheaper sort and are moulded in a tough weather - resistant plastic and have a roughish , undulating finish to simulate natural rock . While being inexpensive and readily transportable , they do have the disadvantage of flexibility which can cause problems during installation . Fibreglass pools are obviously entirely rigid and free - standing , and present no such difficulties during construction , but one must be very careful over the choice of design , for most are made by fibreglass manufacturers with little understanding of plant life and it is often the case that reeds , rushes and irises are expected to become established on a marginal shelf no more than 8 cm ( 3 in ) wide , while the deeper areas of the pool will not have a sufficiently flat floor to place a single waterlily basket . There are many different shapes and sizes to choose from and most can be obtained in a choice of colours , so it is wise to obtain a selection of catalogues from specialists and weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of each type before making what will undoubtedly be a sizeable investment . As in most walks of life , you generally get what you pay for and a higher - priced product will generally be of higher quality .",1
"It is now , however , less abundant in intensively farmed countryside because herbicides have robbed it of weed seeds to eat , and the old farm buildings and ancient hollow trees where it nested have frequently disappeared . There is some mystery about the origin of the stock dove 's name , but it probably came from the habit of nesting in the stocks or trunks of trees . Although tree holes are the most common nesting place , stock doves have been found nesting in rabbit holes and they occasionally take over the abandoned nests of wood - pigeons .

"He proceeds to show , therefore , that with only ideas at his disposal , he can nevertheless distinguish between reality and illusion . There is , he says , ‘ a rerum natura , and the distinction between realities and chimeras retains its full force —[even though]they both equally exist in the mind , and in that sense are alike ideas ’ . He points out that sometimes we have control over our ideas , and sometimes not : often we can set ourselves to imagine what we want ; at other times , however , as in broad daylight , ‘ it is not in my power to … determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view’ . Furthermore , it happens that our ideas are sometimes ‘ more strong , lively , and distinct’ than at others . Berkeley does not elaborate on this second point , but presumably is gesturing towards the difference between actually experiencing something , such as heat , and remembering or anticipating it .",0

"' When I was talking to him , he had this habit of looking over my head and I wondered whether what I was saying was going in , but he was digesting it and seeing how he could turn it round to his way of doing things . The only thing that made my hair stand on end was when I would say : ' Dive through that window there and , as you go through it , hit it with your fists clenched together , tuck your head down in between on your elbows , get through and , as you go through , go into a roll . ' He would go through it sideways , with one arm out , turning his head to the camera . I would say : ' You 're going to break your neck .

"Many local caciques or large landowners expect to have sexual access to campesina women , particularly young girls , living on or near their estates . Class relations are such that it would be very difficult for a campesino family to refuse . Equally , campesina girls , working as maids , are regarded as "" fair game "" by the males of the household . So whether married or not , child - bearing begins at an early age . In the last general census in 1971 , one - third of 14-year - old girls had already experienced at least one pregnancy .",0
"The purpose of this is to increase through rewards and punishments the number of times the child chooses to perform acceptable behaviour and not to perform unacceptable behaviour . Parents and adults deal with children in this way automatically . For example , in any supermarket you will be able to see a parent criticising ( punishing ) a child for lifting a tin off a shelf and then praising ( rewarding ) the child for putting it back when told . This process takes place in thousands of situations with different behaviours and over time the child learns the standards for our society . In older children who are badly behaved , operant learning tells us they are choosing not to produce wanted behaviour .",1

"It is perhaps worth commenting here that informants in this type of study are not usually unhappy about being tape - recorded ; Peter Trudgill ( 1986b ) has suggested that people are now generally familiar with recording equipment and relaxed about being recorded . Third , the method is somewhat wasteful , being quite the converse of Labov 's telephone survey in this respect . Many more speakers and many more hours of speech are usually recorded than can ultimately be analysed ; a useful rule of thumb is that about ten hours will be needed to analyse each hour of recorded data . Another aspect of this extravagance is the large amount of unanalysable recorded data ; this is presumably the point Labov is making when he remarks that the ( technical ) quality of participant - observation data is often poor ( 1981 : 4 ) . We do , however , need to modify the force of this comment by noting that in Belfast no problem was experienced in obtaining plenty of recordings of sufficient technical quality to be analysable .",0
Technical quality and the use of the right exposure coupled with careful composition were all considered in the beginners ' and intermediate sections of the colour slides . In some cases Mr. Powell felt that the reversal of the slide would make it more satisfying to ‘ read’ from left to right .

"They are , however , vulnerable when getting from one of these places to the other . Leaving their nest - holes they have some way to go before the sea can provide them with a refuge .

"While individual officers may indeed have been aware of this work , consideration of it did not form part of the policy - making .

"It is a requirement of the water bye - laws that servicing valves be fitted on the pipes leading to float - operated valves ( ballvalves ) — on cold water or WC cisterns , for example . See page 39 . Most servicing valves have an internal ball with a hole through it , so that just a quarter of a turn is needed to move the valve from fully open to fully closed . Operation is either by a circular knob or with a screwdriver fitted into a slot . Some servicing valves ( sold for installing a washing machine ) are incorporated into a tee fitting and have a lever to operate .",1
"The thought must indeed come to mind with probability theory and the Probability Calculus , and their being imported into causation , despite what was said above about the logical consistency of probability theory and necessitation . Fourthly , there is the satisfaction of a kind of orthodoxy , perhaps with respect to what is taken as somehow of the greatest significance or fundamentality . An interpretation of Quantum Theory comes to mind . For this and the previous three reasons , it is not difficult to conclude , at least tentatively , that more inclination is satisfied by indeterminist than by determinist claims . The general subject of determinism and our inclinations , however , is that of a companion volume to this one , The Consequences of Determinism .",0
"A further faculty acquired in 1983 to examine Temperance Brown 's vault at Steane , Northamptonshire , also ended in failure , the coffin having disintegrated and she having ' gone to earth ' . Though the single - break flat - lidded coffin had made its entrance in the last quarter of the sixteenth century — the lead shell of Lady Elizabeth Howard ( d.1591 ) with appliqué lettering at Withyham , Sussex , is of this type , as is the pictorial representation of Sir Henry Unton 's 1596 coffin in the Unton portrait at the National Portrait Gallery , as well as a small sculptural representation of a coffin on the 1615 mural monument to Susan Kinges at Morston , Norfolk — the single - break gable - lidded shell seems to have been more popular . An example of this type in lead , dated 1648 , rests on the children 's shelf in the De La Warr vault , but of greater interest are three wooden versions . One is now no longer on view : when the church of St Peter 's , Exton , Somerset , was being reordered in 1984 a clay - puddled grave shaft beneath the ledger stone of William Averie ( d.1608 ) was exposed . Within the grave were the remains of a single - break gable - lidded elm coffin , the outer surface covered with pitched cambric or linen and decorated with black - headed upholstery nails .",1

Blind with rage : I know why they say blind — I could n't see him , I could n't see anything — I did n't think what to say , I was just saying it , shouting it , fury pouring out of me like hot tar — my hands were on my hips and clinging on so as to stop myself tearing his straggly hair out , gouging his eyes out , strangling him till his voice went gurgle - croak and his body went limp . ‘ You had them all the time — you trailed me round — you bloody filthy lying bastard — you poked my head into every shit - bin in Bristol — you led me up hill and down dale till my feet were dropping off — you made me steal some people 's boat — I could 've been got by the police — I might be festering in jail now — handcuffed — criminal — you do n't care , you 're criminal anyway — I would n't be surprised if you 'd murdered half a dozen innocent people and cut them up and kept their pieces stashed away in the hole where you 've been hiding my bag and my things and my money and my dreams … ’ Stopped . panted .",0

However , it is also possible that the extra arm of the X chromosome holds genes not found in the Y chromosome . ) A great deal more has to be learned in this area , but it will be evident that even in its genetic aspects ( and others also have an effect ) sex and gender are not an absolutely cut and dried business .

"Theresa Smith , how will we change it ? Well I 'd like to go back to the sorts of things that Barbara Bryant has been talking about . If you talk to women in the sort of project where she 's working , I think you do get a very strong picture of people who have very little confidence in themselves and certainly think that education is not for them , and if you then look at projects like second chance for women , there 's a range of access projects , particularly for for people who want to get back into education when they think that they 've had precious little chance to get anything out of education when they were at school themselves . The sorts of experiences that you then get people talking about is really well I 've learnt to stand up for myself for the first time , erm I now know what I want to do , I know who I am , erm projects where I 've been involved , where you get women saying things like well two years ago I would never have dreamt of going and talking to the Council about my house , or my children , or that I ca n't get a job because I ca n't get child care , and I would n't have dreamt of doing that and people who now say well now I can do that , I know that I can go and stand up for myself and stand up for what I think is right , just as well as my husband can . It 's that sort of change that I think is extremely significant , and I think it happens for women very much at that stage , when they have been through those sorts of experiences themselves , so one way in which I think that we can change things is — and help people to change things for themselves — is very much to support and develop those kinds of second change erm access , returning to education , returning to work , type projects as very much part of mainstream education and employment , and I would like to see a much greater range of those sorts of projects available for people and erm a lot more government resources into supporting that kind of provision .",0

"Agendas , minutes and related papers are available For inspection at the school , but this is no substitute for attendance at meetings if public information and debate is fully intended .

"When the outcome of such influence is some rather high - spirited behaviour no great harm is done but unfortunately peer pressure has also led in many instances to experimentation with alcohol , drugs and glue - sniffing . Teenagers frequently appear to be resentful of parents or teachers but in reality this is often a sign that they are testing authority and seeing just how far they can go . It is a particularly difficult time for many as , on the one hand , they are being urged to make decisions about their future while , on the other , they are expected to toe the line both at home and at school . And all this at a time when they are undergoing dramatic changes both physically and emotionally — changes which they often find very difficult to deal with . The young adult",0

"It was not , however , the sole dimension of his strategy . Just as the interwar prophet of Blitzkrieg had also been a lobbyist for the professional army , so , in the late 1940s and early 1950s , de Gaulle was not content simply to wait for disaster to strike . In June 1946 , a month after a popular referendum had voted down the Constituent Assembly 's proposed constitution and sent the parties back to the drawing board , de Gaulle re - entered the political fray . He did so in a speech in the Norman town of Bayeux — a symbolic location because this town had been one of those that he had visited in his first trip to liberated territory in June 1944 . It is no exaggeration to say that the Bayeux speech established a new direction for postwar Gaullism .",0

"How then do firms determine their prices in practice ? How can they achieve maximum or target levels of profits or sales without precise information concerning their revenues and costs ? One possible answer to this question is that in practice firms may apply a rule - of - thumb pricing method and then use a trial - and - error technique over time to close in on the price and output combination which achieves the chosen objective . For example , consider the monopolist discussed above and suppose that the firm 's executives wish to maximise profits , but have only limited information about the true revenue and cost functions . Suppose in fact that they can only estimate accurately the total and average cost of the output level the firm is currently producing .",0

"Drawing on psychoanalysis , Rochlin ‘ rewrites’ masculinity in a way which makes a virtue of what was hitherto thought of as , or experienced as , a defect : its much remarked insecurity . His argument is as follows : a man 's masculinity is indeed insecure ; it is an endless trial , a ‘ precariously held , endlessly tested , unstable condition’(p . 91 ) . In this it is almost tragic : ‘ the unique vulnerability to tailed expectations is the fatal flaw in the masculine ego … the testing of masculinity knows no bounds … to prove oneself remains a lifelong necessity … . It gives rise to many of man 's anxieties and failures as well as to his often extraordinary achievements’(pp . x , xi ) . The critique of masculinity which says , ‘ for all your confidence you as man are insecure and afraid’ , is not repudiated but incorporated ; man 's insecurity is embraced as an enhancing vulnerability .",0

The party had adopted its current name only in 1965 , having been in power since 1959 following the 1958 revolution . ] The congress was held behind closed doors , and the exclusion of foreign journalists and overseas political delegations encouraged speculation that political divisions existed between the party leadership and membership , represented by 1,800 delegates .

"In the main the need for a plotter is governed by the type of output being generated by the computer . An engineer or draughtsman will need accurate drawings of equipment and installations , a businessman might want charts and graphs showing sales figures . Producing these on conventional printers is a very laborious process and the results will only be in black and white . The only other low - cost option is to take a colour photograph of the screen and whilst this might suffice for business charts it certainly wo n't be accurate enough for a designer or architect . Plotters work in an entirely different way to printers , they draw lines between two points rather than creating their output from pre - formed characters or patterns of dots .",1

"Possibly this comparative scarcity of trees in the east Midland hedgerows — in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire especially — arises from consideration for fox - hunting . In Leicestershire organised fox - hunting developed during the 1770s , in time to enjoy the exhilaration of galloping over miles of unfenced country . Enclosure made things more difficult , or perhaps we should say necessitated new and exciting skills , but at least there were no close ranks of trees to make the fences impossible . Indeed , the first effect of enclosure was to reduce the number of trees in thinly wooded country , for the new fences — hundreds of miles of them — required vast quantities of oak , elm , and ash saplings for posts and rails . Clare , once more , was in no doubt about the diminution of woodland after enclosure :",1
"North thought Reagan might qualify , like Teddy Roosevelt , for the Nobel Peace Prize for ending the Iran - Iraq War , and that Secord was directly in line to get the Medal of Freedom .

Somebody ought to stand up and acknowledge what we have done because we are on the side of the angels.’ North wrote it in his notebook , by that time wearily misspelling it : ‘ Ultimately on the side of the angles’ .

"If only daily data is available , the volatility estimates rely on a small number of observations . For example , if an estimate of the volatility for each day is required , the sample size is 1 .

This is Var(X ) = 0.361 ( X high -X low ) er2 .

"The immediate historical provocation for their critique of conformity , indifference and the apparent predisposition to barbarity is clearly , for Adorno and Horkheimer , the rise of fascism ; but what is more generally at issue is the intrusion of Enlightenment rationality , capitalist common - sense and the logic of commodification into the very core of the cultural field and the aesthetic . In Adorno 's aesthetics , the value of the cultural and the aesthetic lies in difference and negation and it is this which is threatened by the commodification of culture . Developing since the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century , accelerating in the nineteenth century in step with the acceleration of capitalist industry , the process of intrusion increasingly separated culture out into the familiar contours of ' high ' and ' low ' , isolating what it could not assimilate . By the middle of the twentieth century , Adorno found himself confronted with a cultural field in which the squeezed and narrowing pinnacle of aesthetic difference and negation had all but detached itself completely from the squat , commodified mass of capitalist ' affirmative ' culture . For Adorno ( as , at around the same time , for Clement Greenberg ) , the ' genuine ' avant garde , represented most emblematically in his writing by his teacher , Schoenberg , was the last vestige of ' authentic art'whose difficulty and inaccessibility were the marks of its unassimilable difference and its negation of bourgeois rationality , capitalist purposiveness , and what Peter Sloterdijk would later call ' cynical reason ' .",1

"Polybius ' inability to create an appropriate model for the rule of Rome over Italy was inherited by Posidonius and , as far as I know , never remedied by any Greek author . Dionysius of Halicarnassus , who was interested in Italian history as a whole , confined his study to archaic Rome where the problem did not arise . Velleius Paterculus and the Latin source of the first books of Appian 's Civil War ( for which Emilio Gabba suggested the name of Asinius Pollio ) came nearer to an Italian version of Roman political history , but by the time they wrote the imperialism of the Republic had turned into the bureaucratic Empire of the Caesars : what these historians said could no longer bear fruit . Polybius and Posidonius remained the masters in the field : the former survived in sufficient measure to impose his interpretation on modern historians , whereas Posidonius reached the Renaissance only through mediators , such as Diodorus and Strabo and perhaps Sallust and Plutarch . Whereas Polybius ' fortunes can easily be followed , Posidonius ' place in modern thought will be established only when we have a proper study of early ethnography .",0

"Britain wants to encourage movement , not to stifle it , and any talk of sanctions would be bound to have a bad effect . Yet even the British acknowledge that there are individuals and countries ‘ wedded to sanctions’ , and according to Commonwealth officials , Britain may well again find itself in a minority of one when the subject is debated . Many Commonwealth leaders believe the movement in South Africa is the result of pressure already applied , and that only by turning the screw can the world be sure that there will be no turning back . African leaders who recognise that it may be difficult to impose any further sanctions believe they have found the way forward . They want to see financial pressure applied , to ensure South Africa can not roll over its debt or raise new capital .",0

"Nor does the loud ovation after a well - played , but not very insightful account of the finale . Solti 's reading can nevertheless by prized for its straightforward handling of the central phase of the first movement and the climax of the third . Playing these passages by the book proves to be a perfectly satisfying approach to their architecture , and one wonders why so many other conductors feel compelled to modify Shostakovich 's tempos . The pacing of that third movement climax is one of the few weak spots in Claus Peter Flor 's interpretation — the jump forward at 8′40″ ( fig . 129 in the score ) is either a structural miscalculation or a different take , and the premature slowing at 10′12″ ( fig . 137 ) is no more effective . For the most part though , Flor unfolds the massive first movement with an ideal blend of spaciousness and momentum .",0

Since then , many of His followers have been martyred for refusing to keep quiet and toe the ' official ' line . The good news is that the death of Jesus on the Cross defeated sin and evil for ever . He came to bring God 's rule to our world , a rule of justice and righteousness .",0
"‘ You would n't want me for a cousin - in - law , by the sound of it.’ ‘ Too bloody true!’ he snarled , but cooled down marginally , though that dangerous glint was still around somewhere when he added , ‘ But since you 've just said you 've no intention of marrying my cousin — this is what you 're going to do.’ Briefly he paused , then , ‘ The next time you see him , while letting him down gently , you will make sure that he knows you do n't love him.’ ‘ You think I 'm capable of it — letting him down gently?’ Leith queried , sarcasm getting the better of her .",0
"His place is taken by Kenny Wilson . GH - K are the only club in the relegation zone with a positive points differential : indeed , only league leaders Melrose have scored more points than them this season . That , however , is of scant consequence to coach Brian Gilbert , who ruefully reflected : ‘ At this late stage of the season it should be about polishing off moves , not going back to the drawing board . That , as a result of injury , is largely what we have been forced to do.’ Acads had cheerier news on the casualty front , when Rob Wainwright , their international back - row forward , attended training on Thursday , though he is not yet fit to play .",0
"Nobody understands us : we do n't even understand ourselves . But we are fascinated by ourselves — which is why Jane 's thoughts rabbited on so long about her country . After the glimpse of Scandinavia through Riborg , and later the experience of Hungary , Jane was so far carried away by her enthusiasm for classless freedom , the beauty of northern landscapes , plus the humorous awareness of the central European people , that when a Finn crossed her path , she was fair game . A Finn represented the fusion of Scandinavia and Hungary ( to which country they were first cousins ) so no doubt she expected too much of Erkki . Anyway , he looked like an ageing Nordic god .",0
"He worked out where The Bar was on his maps , and then checked this perspective against the actual view — from where he saw the city it looked like The Bar was right in the middle of it , not hidden away at all like it was on the map . He also got a copy of the underground railway map , and tried to trace that invisible geography over what he could actually see ; he would even try and trace the map of the flight paths of aeroplanes over the city , deciding which direction indicated which distant country . Boy thought he would like to see the city under heavy snow ; then it would look like a real map , all in black and white , the river a thick black ribbon , or , if frozen as he knew it had once been , a clean white ribbon , the only space in the city without streets , names , lights or indeed owners . The man who actually had the lease or paid the rent anyway on this flat was a man who worked sorting for the Post Office . Boy was his lodger I suppose .",1

"Glenda McKee shook off Gillian Dawson as she tried to climb all over her , got to the by - line , and sent in a superb cross which Judith Chapman duly despatched into the net . Loreto supporters , who had been very vocal up until then , were silenced .

But against a resolute Portadown defence they were getting little change . Loreto did try and upset Portadown 's rhythm with some blatant stick tackling , but both umpires were in no mood to take any nonsense and carded two of the Dubliners .",0
"Why was he hesitating and procrastinating ? Where was he ? And the answers to those questions will in turn beg further questions , as we apprehend more and more of the situation ( see 5.2 , 5.5.2 ) .

But the move begs the question , why did it take them so long ? The first signs of contamination were discovered just 18 months ago .",0
"When we come to deal with infant baptism we take the view that the failure of parents to measure up to certain standards is to be allowed to stand in the way of the grace of God being available for their children . This is particularly difficult in view of the fact that it is just their children who are probably far more in need of that grace of God just because of the attitude of their parents , than those of parents who measure up to all the standards that we impose . Now I 'm aware that many parents bring their children for baptism from reasons of superstition or custom or anything you like I 'm reminded of a certain tax gatherer who , inspired by sheer idle curiosity , climbed a tree curiosity maybe took him up the tree but it was the grace of God that brought him down . And I care not what may be the motive of the parents who bring their children and want them offered to Christ in the sacrament of baptism it is the grace of God that is available for them there and I think we should be very thoughtful about these matters and try to take up either one position or the other . Either the grace should be available to all or there should be a right to impose restrictions .",1

Maggie gave a low moan , her knees sagging , and he caught her close , turning her head to his shoulder , deepening the kiss and holding her against the length of his body .

It was nip and tuck up to 7 - 7 before Best opened up a 12 - 9 lead .

"Or does it leave work relationships unspecified ( Christianity ) ? These very basic differences become manifest in groups . For example , a belief in strength through superiority means that in Japanese groups ‘ saving face’ is a major consideration in negotiations , whereas in east coast American groups , where everyone , at least in theory , has the same opportunity , this is less an issue and failure is rationalized ( ‘ So we blew it’ ) . In South East Asian or Middle Eastern groups the concept of leaderless groups is absurd ( if for different reasons ) but this is not so in collective cultures ( Norway , Finland , Denmark ) where a leader can be seen as a facilitator not as the final word . Hence , loosely structured group meetings may be sensible in Copenhagen but would be inappropriate in Dubai or Singapore .",0

"Even more alien to the spirit of British law , is a recent amendment to the Directive which enables a member state to declare an object a national treasure ‘ before or after its lawful removal’ , and therefore take retrospective action at the point of sale or at any time subsequently . These are just two of many aspects of this Directive which give serious cause for concern , and it is not just Britain , but also Germany , Holland and Belgium that have reservations . The Directive must be sent back to the drawing board . The protection of what is truly important to the culture of the whole of Europe is too serious a matter to be left to unrealistic laws . It requires the cooperation of every citizen , and no law which unreasonably infringes the freedoms of that citizen can be expected to be effective .",0
"The problem sheets are so difficult now nobody can do them and they usually just wait until the answers come out every week and usually it 's just a case of copying them down . Students are often left to muddle along ; the help they may need is not forthcoming , even in tutorials . Consequently many students , by the final year in particular , felt that they had lost all hope of making sense of the subject or getting to grips with the work . So far , we have seen that while physics was viewed by students as exciting and forward - looking , in practice the teaching tended to be conventional and hierarchical , very much like school , with students being given a body of information to absorb . In higher education , however , students are expected to do far more practical experiments than in school .",0

"Careful searching through old junk shops and around antique markets may well produce endless ideas and inspiration from which you can work . Victorian lockets look beautiful if they contain a tiny flower arrangement instead of a photograph , and if you are lucky enough to find a fob watch that no longer works you can transform it into a stunning and unusual frame for a miniature flower design . Even old brass curtain rings can be used as small circular frames , and I am sure that the more you look , the more the ideas that will come to mind . Achieving the right balance in both the size and quantity of flowers and foliage in a miniature picture is extremely important . For instance , if you choose fairly large material you will be limited in the amount you can use and the resulting picture may look rather dull .",0

Substituting t - butyl hydroperoxide for alloxan in a similar experiment , Clark found as he had hoped , that parasitaemia again dropped radically .

"An officer must know some chemistry and biology , and the local geology and geography . He must , in particular , be familiar with the science of water treatment and purification processes , and well acquainted with manufacturing and agricultural techniques in order to understand local industrial and farming problems .

As long as they know what kinds of acts or events might be prosecutable , they take the view that the arcane business of the law is best left to senior staff .

"Each atom contains a nucleus which is made from nucleons ( i.e. neutrons and protons ) with electrons circulating around the nucleus . Nucleons feel the strong nuclear force whereas electrons do not ; thus it is reasonable to ask whether nucleons and electrons feel the same gravitational attraction . The nucleon - to - electron ratio varies from unity for hydrogen to about 2.5 for elements with high atomic number , so that any difference in the gravitational force felt by nucleons and electrons would appear as a difference in the gravitational acceleration of elements of high and low atomic number . Another significant feature of matter is that the nuclear mass is smaller than the sum of the nucleon masses by the binding energy due to the nuclear force between them . This nuclear binding energy is zero for hydrogen where the nucleus is a single proton and rises to 0.7 per cent of the mass x c 2 of the constituent nucleons in the case of iron .",1

"A typical Kelmscott Press page from William Morris 's edition of Swinburne 's Atalanta in Calydon ( 1894 ) . The type is Morris 's Chaucer , as used in the masterpiece . Whatever their character , there is one curious feature shared by most private press books , which is that they are very rarely read — a fact testified to by the fact that an extraordinary number are found unopened , as though their charm and beauty may not be defiled even by the gentlest slitting of the sacred sections at the top and fore - edges . I think I have read somewhere a bookseller 's comment that it would be fair to describe an ' opened ' private press book as ' rare in this state ' . Be that as it may , these books are certainly easier to find in fine condition than almost any other kind , even after fifty or sixty years .",1

"An officer must know some chemistry and biology , and the local geology and geography . He must , in particular , be familiar with the science of water treatment and purification processes , and well acquainted with manufacturing and agricultural techniques in order to understand local industrial and farming problems . Knowledge of the law relating to control of water pollution , beyond a broad conception of the pollution offences , however , is regarded as unimportant and is claimed by only a small minority of field men , because the job is done ‘ by experience’ and the application of rules - of - thumb — not ‘ by the book’ . As long as they know what kinds of acts or events might be prosecutable , they take the view that the arcane business of the law is best left to senior staff .

"For the middle classes Britain meant business and they wanted constitutional change to prevent revolution not promote it . This being the case it was seen as essential to set a financial qualification for the franchise that would give the vote to "" decent "" farmers and shopkeepers whilst excluding the lower social orders who might use their votes to plunder the public purse for their own advantage . For their part , although the die - hard aristocratic opponents of change were desperately anxious about opening the floodgates , they nevertheless came to see that the price of resistance was becoming too high and might even bring disaster and revolution . As they were forced to respond to the pressure for constitutional change the established interests saw a glint of light at the end of the political tunnel and came to entertain the hope that if the middle classes were allowed a subordinate share of power then they just might turn from being poachers to gamekeepers of the system and so side with the aristocracy in helping to keep the working classes in order . In other words , if it were possible to remove the grievances of the middle classes against those above them , then it might also be possible to nip off the danger of an alliance between the middle classes and the working classes below them .",0

"Other troops which have a supporting role , and which can be considered in this category are Orc and Savage Orc Boyz armed with bows or crossbows . Orcs and Savage Orcs are good fighting troops and can therefore be thought of as core units , but they can also be used as quality supporting troops if armed with missile weapons . With bows or crossbows you can shoot up the enemy before your core units get to grips with them , or you can attempt to draw enemy missile troops into an exchange to divert fire from the core units as they advance . Once the core units are engaged you can pile in alongside them or form them up beside the core units to block enemy attacks from the sides . In this supporting role your Orc units do n't need to be so large and there is less need to provide standards or characters .",0

"In such an archetypal world , where ‘ good’ is constantly and insecurely balanced in an eternal struggle against ‘ evil’ , the objective explication of the rituals and symbols which surround and mystify police work can seem tantamount to a treasonable act . In 1979 , James Anderton , the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester , described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from ‘ seditionist … interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy’(Thompson 1979 : 380 ) . In the light of such a polemic stand , it begs the question whether the revelation of how crime figures are manipulated by the police to sustain institutional beliefs ( see Chapter 5 ) could be said to undermine democracy or be classified as sedition . For Anderton vehemently rejects the idea of any internal evaluation which might explore the moralities or philosophies of policing : ‘ there is simply no room in the management and organization of police operations for vague , academic dissertations’(Police Review ; 90 , 19 November 1982 : 4684 ) .

Acceptance by the left of the basic parameters of the mixed economy was exemplified by Antony Crosland 's book The Future of Socialism , published in 1956 . He argued : Traditionally , or at least since Marx , socialist thought has been dominated by the economic problems posed by capitalism , poverty , mass unemployment , squalor , instability and even the possibility of the collapse of the whole system …",1

"How is it that you have no faith ? And they became very much afraid and said to one another who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? Jesus had been , with his disciples and he had spent the whole day in teaching and preaching to the people , he 'd been explaining to them what the kingdom of God was like , he 'd been telling them some of the parables that perhaps we 're familiar with , he 'd been telling them about the parable of the sewer and the seed , the man who went out and he sewed his seed and different things went wrong birds came and picked up the stuff that fell by the wayside , some fell on stony ground and it could n't put down any roots , some fell amongst thorns and they were quickly choked , but some did fall in good prepared soil and that grew . And so Jesus had been teaching the people . And at the end of the day he 's tired , he 's physically weary , and he says let 's get away for a while let 's go over to the other side .",1

"Again , agoutis in south - east Peru store fruits of Astrocaryum , a palm , in hoards , which may lead to clumped distribution as well as to the ‘ clumped’ behaviour of white - lipped peccaries , which in turn disinter this food . By contrast , it has been argued by Janzen that species - specific ‘ predation’ of juveniles growing around their mother will lead to a progressive decline in density of successful saplings towards the mother . This might then account for the apparently non - environmentally controlled distribution pattern in which other species could insinuate themselves in the holes of the forest ‘ lattice’ devoid of the first species . This has been extended in the case of specific fruit and seed predators to account for the frequency of dioecy in some forests . In dioecious species , regulated in numbers by such predators , a high level of gene exchange could be maintained by the presence of a number of male trees that would not be attractive to these predators .",1

"Policy debates in the US are chiefly preoccupied with ensuring that banks are never "" too big to fail ; that private investors rather than taxpayers hold "" contingent capital , "" which in a crash can be converted into equity ; and that "" over - the - counter "" markets ' functioning be improved through greater reliance on centralized trading , clearing , and settlements . The chief point of intersection between the European and US approaches is major banks . This convergence has less to do with regulatory thinking on bank size or function than with a common need to play to the political gallery and raise more tax revenue . Banks ' balance sheets are systemically dangerous when bloated by leverage , and it is this that regulatory or fiscal policy should address through liquidity buffers and leverage ratios . After all , it is the contagiousness of financial crises , not banks ' size , that matters .",0
"It was a calm , windless and hazy morning as we left Clapham and headed up through two dark tunnels along the old Drove Road of Thwaite Lane , a continuation of the medieval monastic highway that crossed the Dales , linking the lands of Fountains Abbey . After about a mile we quit the lane for pastureland below Robin Proctor 's Scar , beyond which lies the famous Norber Erratics field — a geologist 's paradise . Here are scattered numerous slate boulders which have been carried by glacier action and dumped on a limestone shelf . Many of the dark rocks stand on limestone pedestals , the surrounding rocks having been eroded away . Once through the boulder field , a grassy sward high above picturesque Crummack Dale led steadily up to a broad plateau near Long Scar , from where we had our first view of the distant and brooding Ingleborough rising from a vast array of moor and limestone pavements , shimmering in the summer heat like a huge field of cotton grass .",1
"If you could n't afford the luxury of foreign travel , then a lantern slide show or the extremely popular stereoscope could bring the world right into your parlour . Battalions of courageous , if not always creative , photographers were dispatched to the ends of the earth to record breathtaking views , edifying ruins and exotic people for home viewing on the stereoscope . However , one ca n't help thinking that it must have been a source of frustration for these early travel photographers to be confronted by the riotous colours of the far east and Africa , knowing that it could only be reproduced in black and white . To give a ‘ true’ impression of the exotic splendour of these far off places , many photographers resorted to hand colouring their work . A practical system of colour photography had been eagerly searched for right from the beginning .",1
"NOTES TOWARDS A CRITICAL PRACTICE : PUBLIC ART AND FEMINISM The current trend for publicly sited artworks could be viewed as a by - product of the postmodernist influences in the art world . As artists , we have seen shifts int he boundaries of public and private , high and low , inaccessible and accessible and , indeed , even personal and political but the influences of past feminist art practices on these moves is very rarely acknowledged .

"The core of their problem was that such a device necessarily had to be a computer and a powerful one . The answer they devised is called Compact Disc Interactive ( CD - I ) .

Computers , Fletcher maintains , always have their on - off switch on the back . Appliances have them on the front .",0
"This is because chemists ' experiments last for years not thousands of millions of years , and because only a handful of chemists , not thousands of millions of chemists , are engaged in doing these experiments . If the spontaneous origin of life turned out to be a probable enough event to have occurred during the few man - decades in which chemists have done their experiments , then life should have arisen many times on Earth , and many times on planets within radio range of Earth . Of course all this begs important questions about whether chemists have succeeded in duplicating the conditions of the early Earth but , even so , given that we ca n't answer these questions , the argument is worth pursuing . If the origin of life were a probable event by ordinary human standards , then a substantial number of planets within radio range should have developed a radio technology long enough ago ( bearing in mind that radio waves travel at 186,000 miles per second ) for us to have picked up at least one transmission during the decades that we have been equipped to do so . There are probably about 50 stars within radio range if we assume that they have had radio technology for only as long as we have .",0

Gas Board Unlike the 1970s Gas Board , Telecom has its hands tied by the regulator : the Office of Telecommunications would take a dim view of it cross - subsidising ISDN installation at the expense of another part of its business . Beyond that there is the sheer cost involved in visiting all of its customers and replacing the BT box on their wall with another , more expensive one and writing off the old analogue exchange line cards . Forcing its customers to junk their telephones and buy expensive new digital handsets will not be popular either , so BT is considering installing combined analogie and ISDN junction boxes — which has the disadvantage of pushing up the cost yet again .",0

"Its reluctance is largely a result of the strict financial regime imposed by the government as part of its general campaign to improve efficiency in the public sector and under which all rail improvements have to demonstrate an 8 % return on the capital before approval is granted .

Although the recent decisions on the Channel Tunnel and the PBKAL ( Paris - Brussels - Cologne - Amsterdam - London ) line are signs that Britain may be coming in from the cold , the country is still seen as an isolated outpost of a European transport network in which the main traffic flows will run north to south linking the industrial areas of France , Germany and Italy .

"Thus , if the water argument of doubtful validity . Perhaps we are left with the conclusion that the main ingredient in the campaign which resulted in the Foxton Inclined Plane was the enthusiastic advocacy of Gordon Thomas himself . Impractical , quixotic , unsuccessful , are all adjectives that come to mind when considering the strange phenomenon of the Foxton Inclined Plane . That it was erected , operated for a short while and then reverted to ignominious dereliction are all true . But it was a considerable enterprise and it must have had some considerable justification .",0
"Before the main feature , however , there were a couple of important sideshows to set before the drenched assembly in the shape of the Plate and Bowl finals . In the third tier competition a beleaguered group of Romanian students , with little more than £ 30 spending money for a week in Hong Kong , still had enough brass to beat Papua New Guinea for the Bowl . Local boys Hong Kong made good their pledge to bring home the bacon for retiring coach Jim Rowark . They even gave him a Plate to carry it on — silver , that is — when they beat Tonga in a pulsating second - tier final which saw Gareth James power over for the winning try in extra time . On a Plate !",0

"Her mother was n't at home , and her father wanted to see her to the car , which was parked in the street . She forbade him to accompany her beyond the door and walked alone over the golden sand past the flower - beds to the gate . She had a lump in her throat and an enormous yearning to say something beautiful to her father , something that could not be expressed by words , and so without quite knowing how it happened she suddenly turned her head and with a smile tossed out her arm in the air , easily , flowing , as if to see each other many more times . An instant later she recalled the forty - year - old lady , who twenty - five years earlier had stood in the same place and had waved at her father in the same way . That upset and confused her .",1
"A full - strength Gloucester side against Richmond . It should have been easy ; it should have been a walkover . The 4 tries were good enough , but inbetween , the cherry and whites made heavy weather of the game . They were 10 - 15 down at half - time . Richmond scored the first try .",0
"Government forces had constantly to be at hand . Nor was government aid to the landlord restricted to armed assistance . Despite the opportunities opened out from the late eighteenth century by an expanding grain trade , a marked increase in the land available , and a steady rise in labour and money dues extracted from the peasantry , the nobility found it difficult to make ends meet . Through the agency of the Nobles ' Bank established in 1754 , and later the State Loan Bank , the State issued massive loans to sustain them . In 1762 commoners were forbidden to purchase serfs , thereby giving noble industrialists a temporary advantage since hired labour was still scarce .",0
"The night 's events must have given them a very clear idea of the depth of local opinion.’ The health council has not yet taken an official position on the board 's proposals , but Mr Tait said that since Arbroath was a popular holiday town , it required better services than that of a cottage hospital . The local MP , Andrew Welsh , has called on Lord Fraser to reverse the proposals , made , he said , by an unelected body behind closed doors . ‘ The board seems to have learned nothing about how the people of Arbroath feel for their own hospital . It is a disgraceful situation and the board should be ashamed of itself,’ he said .",0
"Since the 1950s the main achievements in Bach research have been based on a new examination of music sources . In the case of the vocal works — many of which can be dated virtually to the day of composition — this has led to a fundamental change in our perception of Bach 's activities and outlook . Similar work on the sources of the instrumental , particularly keyboard , works has begun only in the last decade or so , and is now bearing fruit in a far clearer understanding of Bach 's thoughts and intentions . This work has shed much new light not only on chronology , and therefore on the development of Bach 's style , but also on performance practice and what is loosely termed reception history . This is currently the main thrust of new thinking about Bach .",0
"The range was wide , but only the first two attracted much notice , the Arts Council Working Party pointing out in 1969 that since these were not crimes at all , how could it be ‘ a heavily punishable crime to ‘ induce’ these particular non - crimes?’ If obscenity laws were really about sexual conformity , their Report continued , then ‘ no Royal Commission could … draw an intelligible line between what is acceptable and what is not acceptable … [nor could]such a Commission find any evidence that anyone has been corrupted or … depraved by pornography’ . The 1959 Act was a law ‘ to regulate the evolution of private mores’ , said the Report , begging the question of what particular weight was to be given to this word ‘ mores’ . Were ‘ mores’ matters of serious concern to the community , for example , and what significance ought they to have in a court of law ? Mr Justice Stable told a jury that the words ‘ to deprave and corrupt’ must not be construed as ‘ to shock and disgust’ , which is not a criminal offence , the argument Lord Gardiner had deployed in gaining an acquittal in the Lady Chatterley case .",0
"Perhaps the greatness which Cluny achieved amongst Western monasteries shows , amongst other things , that in the final analysis living saints were even more effective than dead ones . This account of Western Christianity in the early Middle Ages may have been rather weighted towards the political , and perhaps , given the political complexion of the discussion , it may be surprising to many readers that more has not been said about the papacy . The popes pressed their primatial and jurisdictional claims with impressive continuity in this period ; using every appeal to them made by Carolingian churchmen seeking to bolster their own positions ; making a bid to establish the authority of the papacy over the Bulgarian church ; declaring its sole power to establish a new archbishopric as at Magdeburg in 968 ; and developing the special relationship with the new Polish church at the turn of the first millennium which would ultimately bear fruit in a Polish pope at the turn of the second . But the political story of the Christian church in this age is a story particularly about bishops . Bishop Rathier of Verona wrote in the 930s that the church was one in all its bishops ; that not Jerusalem , not Rome , not Alexandria , had received a special prerogative of rule to the exclusion of others ( he tucks Rome pointedly into the middle ) .",0
"So I felt that our heritage was basically a spiritual heritage … . I went to Gaelic matches in Dublin . I went to Croke Park and I had not the slightest interest in Protestantism but I did come from a Fermanagh family where you did live cheek by jowl with republicanism so I had imbibed it undoubtedly and it resurfaced , the inherited knowledge of the heart of the controversy in Ulster . It was there all the time but I had turned my back upon it in a sense , so when I got converted , and of course I was listening to the Big Man 's comments on events and I recognized the validity of what he was saying .

"Usually the choice of typeface and style is simple to make ; pick one that looks good to your eye . However , once you have chosen a typeface , Bookman for example , stick to it .

"Jonathan Smyth and Callum McLeod added second - half goals as Civil Service ran out 3 - 1 winners . It was not such a good day for Waverley , Edinburgh 's third side in the last eight . They were beaten 2 - 1 by Pender at Uddingston , where goals from Ian McWhinney and John Brotherton put Pender in the driving seat before Dave Jackson notched a last - minute consolation . The final tie between Hazlehead and Touche Ross was a story of squandered penalties .

"McKenzie looked as if he might have done enough to retain his crown after coming back from a ninth - round crisis in which he was floored by a two - punch combination to the body . The 30-year - old champion from Croydon pulled himself up at nine with seemingly no more than a split second to spare and it was possible that American referee Rudy Battle , handling his 57th world title fight , gave him the benefit of the doubt . Thereafter , McKenzie had to dig deep into his resources to reach the final bell . He lacked spark from the start and never hit the kind of form which won him this title in the same ring last October . On that night , McKenzie outscored a very capable performer in Jesse Benavides but could never reach those standards .",0

"In the absence of a Ministry of Justice the Home Office has acquired its responsibilities for criminal justice piecemeal over many years .

"Although Evert had the day off from the Federation Cup yesterday , her presence was still felt , particularly by the Australian team , who surprisingly defeated Bulgaria 2 - 1 . Prior to the match , Evert had told the Australian captain , Wendy Turnbull , to tell her No . 1 player , Anne Minter , ' that if she can beat me as she did in Toronto ( in August ) , then she can beat Manuela Maleeva ' . Evert 's prediction was spot - on as Minter grabbed a thrilling 6 - 3 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 4 victory that saved Australia 's bacon after Liz Smylie had lost the opening singles rubber 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 to Katerina Maleeva . Those two results left the outcome of the quarter - final tie hinging on the doubles , in which Smylie was joined by Janine Thompson against Team Maleeva . Not suprisingly , it was a nerve - racking finale but eventually the more experienced Australians triumphed 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 , to carry their country into the semi - finals for the first time in four years .",0

"But most was not at such a high level , was concentrated within the last six or seven generations which ( as Peters notably argues ) was the limit of what a contemporary grandfather could tell as ' what my grandfather told me ' , or ' what my father told me about his grandfather'(Peters , 1970 ) . This timespan has significant consequences for the construction of genealogies ; it also resulted in an emphasis on genealogically restricted history . Nomads did not have addresses , did not make the history of territories . Rather , they had lines of descent , furcating from a common source ; the lower down the genealogy , the closer the history . For reasons Peters ( 1970 ) has made abundantly clear , the six - to - seven generation level was where lineages marked their beginnings and defined their separate identities : most Zuwaya history was ' local ' to lineages .",0

"There is , indeed , a much less rigid distinction between working and non - working hours , for with easier accessibility between home and workplace the farm worker tends to be involved in the job for as long as it demands , rather than working to any set hours . Similarly farmers are more prepared to be indulgent about their employees ' working hours as long as the necessary tasks are carried out efficiently . In general relationships between the farmer and his workers become more informal , more personal and — because of their living cheek - by jowl around the farm — more pervasive . Although there is a risk that life can become too self - contained and claustrophobic , farmers nevertheless find it easier to inspire some degree of personal loyalty among their workers and allow the class animosities of the occupational community to be vastly reduced . As we have already seen , this reduction in the social distance between farmers and farm workers is also aided by the impact of the newcomers to the village .",0
"A magnetic physician Richard Fifield provides a perspective , and Peter J.

His conclusion was that the field increased with depth and was related to the Earth 's core according to the inverse cube law . R.F.",0

"While this is not measuring the effectiveness of the advertising , merely memory of it , it is possibly indicative . Research on visual memory , moreover , shows that recognition of pictures , after one quite short exposure , is normally very high over quite a long period . It is generally accepted — but only as a rule of thumb — that an average of two - and - a - half to three OTS ( opportunities to see ) is a fairly minimal level for a burst of TV advertising . ( This is equivalent to some 200 TVRs , for a coverage of 70 per cent and , therefore , an OTS frequency of 2.9 , since OTS is equal to TVRs divided by coverage . ) It is only fair to say , though , that work by some econometricians ( see page 103 ) has suggested that optimum rates of TV advertising require far less frequency than this , at least for well - established brands .",0

"An unsecured creditor has no standing to prevent the holder of a void charge from enforcing it but , somewhat anomalously , such a creditor gets protection against an unregistered charge if the company goes into liquidation or administration . Since an administrator and liquidator ( particularly the latter ) are more or less statutory trustees for unsecured creditors , it could be argued that there is nothing anomalous about this . This , however , begs the question of what are the ‘ trust’ assets . The justification for this is probably that it provides the chargee with an additional incentive to ensure that his charge is registered . ( ii ) Late registration Failure to register a charge within the 21-day period does not preclude its subsequent registration ; a charge can be registered outside the 21-day period at any time prior to the company 's liquidation or the appointment of an administrator without the need to obtain a court order .",0

"But this passage reveals other features of Montini 's nature . He was lucid about himself and knew perfectly well what was being said behind his back . With his keen sense of the complexity of situations , he refused to see the world or the Church in black - and - white terms . By professional training he had the diplomat 's sense of nuances .

"The most immediate question concerns the possibility of another Israel - Hezbollah war , fears of which have mounted throughout this year , fueled by reports of new missile transfers to Hezbollah and intermittent threats from Israel . Those who foresee war argue that Israel is unwilling to tolerate a heavily armed Iranian proxy on its border while tensions with Iran over the nuclear issue remain unresolved . Although war is unlikely in the coming months , if sanctions on Iran do n’t bear fruit by early 2011 , Israel might feel the need to act . If it launched military strikes on Iran ’s nuclear installations , Hezbollah would likely join the fray and Israel would have to engage Hezbollah at the same time . Alternatively , Israel might launch a pre - emptive war against Hezbollah in order to rob Iran of a nearby retaliatory capacity .",0

"It is an extreme form of the denial that we talked about earlier . It means the person never has to work through their grief , but can stay poised at a moment in time , hoping that the news they heard , but can not believe , turns out to be wrong after all . The picture comes to mind of Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens ' Great Expectations sitting in her wedding dress for many years waiting for the groom who will not come . More generally we read reports of people waiting for their relative who is ‘ presumed dead’ in some conflict or accident . Such people will often say , ‘ I would certainly know if he had died — I would feel it — and so I 'm sure he 's still alive.’",0

A good agency interviewer will look through it and pick up on the same gaps and discrepancies which will appear to the job interviewer but will not be looking with any one particular job in mind . Do not be surprised if an agency interviewer is rather alarmingly direct . He or she is trying to get a very clear picture of what you can do so that they can place you accurately and not send you on too many pointless interviews . In effect they will be assessing you in much the same way that you make your own self - assessment and then trying to match you to jobs in the way that you should do when applying for jobs directly . You will get more out of the agency and interviewer and make their task easier if you have already made your own attempt at self - assessment ( see p. 9 ) .,0
"The Japanese examples , for instance , include micro - mini cars , while there are no such models in the US and European samples . In another contrast , the average complexity of the products ( as measured by price ) is low in Japan . A third variation is the degree of supplier participation in engineering , which is highest in Japan and lowest in the US . Yet one more distinction is the conclusion that the Japanese use more unique parts — elements designed specifically for a particular model . Technically it is possible to adjust for these discrepancies by applying regression coefficients to the data , but even after this is done , major Japanese lead - time advantages — of 13 to 14 months — remain .",1

But sometimes it is disturbing to mothers , so if you feel uncomfortable about it you can try giving him a toy to hold while he 's on the toilet seat’ ; and in general : ‘ If you take it easy in caring for your baby , you will be doing him a great service.’ Flexibility serves one major aim : to allow parents to enjoy their role . ‘ When you both feel light - hearted enough to enjoy your baby , you are making a good start’ says Infant Care on its second page , and Spock uses the same injunction , ‘ Enjoy Your Baby’ , as a subheading in his chapter ‘ The Right Start’ .",0

"Note incidentally , that the term ‘ photosynthesis’ applies to two different processes : first , the splitting of water ; and second , the joining of released hydrogen to carbon dioxide , to create organic molecules . These two abilities presumably evolved separately ; after all , the splitting of water is useful in its own right , because it releases some chemical energy . But the second process — the creation of organic molecules incorporating hydrogen — was the icing on the cake which gave the photosynthesizing organisms their supremacy . In existing plants and cyanobacteria , the two components of photosynthesis are very closely linked , and run as one smooth , continuous process . In early times , then — certainly more than two billion years ago photosynthesis evolved .",0

"In any case , the analyst can change his model at a later stage , even when mapping the model onto a database . Entities participate in functions of the organisation and the attributes are those data elements that are required to support the functions .

Entities and attributes are further distinguished by their role in events ( discussed below ) . A relationship in an entity model normally represents an association between two entities .",0

"In 1663 an Act of Charles II had placed a partial ban on the importation of foreign cattle to England ; the ban became total in 1666 and permanent in 1680 . In Scotland , Irish imports were banned , and after the Union in 1707 the total ban on European imports extended to Scotland and at the same time free trade between England and Scotland was allowed . Prohibition of imports continued , in theory if not in practice , until 1842 , though many European cattle did manage to slip through the net . During the eighteenth century the population of Britain as a whole doubled and politicians and farmers began to worry about how to feed the people . The nineteenth - century agricultural historian Youatt calculated that in the second half of the eighteenth century every Londoner purchased an average of half a pound of meat a day — more than twice as much as the average in Paris or Brussels .",0

"Repeat the process as defined for the upper floors , inspecting each room in a convenient order , but with three important additions : inspect for rising damp ; check the security of the windows and doors ; and finally check the meters , valves and fuses etc , associated with the water , gas and electricity supplies .

"Excess LDL , rejected by the now full - up cells are deposited in the walls of the arteries , where they can build up and make the arteries narrower .

The more LDL you have in your blood , therefore , the worse it is for your heart . However , if a cell has too much cholesterol , it can be removed by an HDL particle colliding with the cell and picking up the cholesterol that is excess to requirements . When the HDL get to the liver , they interact with receptors that are specific for HDL .",1

"The movie 's message is plain and unequivocal : do drugs and die .

That 's the plot in cut and dried form , though there 's the added twist of Keaton initially agreeing to undergo treatment only as a means of outmanouevring his creditors . There 's also a shot of doomy love interest ( Keaton trying to get fellow addict Katy Baker off ) and dopey oedipal sparring ( Keaton trying to get counsellor M Emmet Walsh on ) , but in the end any attempt at getting a fix on using as a way of life is elbowed puritanically aside .

"Hence , there were very few ‘ turnovers’ , perhaps only two in a game . At least this muted , just by a little , the effects . Judging from early games in this country , and especially by the dreadful Leicester v England match , our referees are going by the book and will blow rucks and mauls dead far more quickly . There will be more turnovers ( more rucks and mauls ended without the ball emerging ) , more frustration . Still more horrors — if rugby under the new law is difficult to play and to control on a dry day in South Africa , imagine the effect in marshy old England in the mud and rain of January ; imagine the shambles the game will become at the lower levels in those conditions with the sanctuary of the next scrum no longer available to the team carrying the ball .",0
"Apart from the first item , which is solely concerned with whether the whole sentence conforms to the rules of the adult grammar , each grammatical feature is assigned a score which reflects its developmental complexity . For example , main verbs — such as ' I see you ' and ' He is coming ' — score one point ; irregular past verbs — such as ate and saw — score two ; while the use of have with a past tense verb ( ' I 've eaten ' ) scores seven points . The eight grammatical features which Lee scores are shown in Figure 7.4 , with examples of highest and lowest scoring items . In addition to these categories , Lee suggests that one point be added , to the total score , for every utterance which meets all the grammatical criteria for acceptable adult sentences . The mean Developmental Sentence Score ( DSS ) is derived by adding the total sentences score for a sample of 50 utterances and dividing the total by 50 .",1

"Against this , as we saw , the existentialists argued that rather than making futile attempts to "" eliminate "" the problem one should subject it to a different type of treatment that would help place it in a proper philosophical perspective , and this was correct as far as it went . Unfortunately , the treatment offered was itself restrictive and inadequate , with the existentialist analysis proving utterly incapable of providing a satisfactory account of the objectivity aspects of ontological claims . The only remedy , then , is to dig deeper into the conceptual roots of such claims and subject them to a comprehensive structural analysis . Such an analysis , if vigorously pursued , will show , among other things , that all properties are ultimately functions of certain structures , and that reality in the most fundamental sense of the word is structure simpliciter . It is not an "" aggregate "" of certain objects and attributes .",0

I should explain here that I am one of two brothers — and that my elder brother , Leonard , was killed during the Southern African War while I was still a boy .

"Before moving on , two brief observations . First , at the level of the student 's developmental process , culture as process seems prima facie to offer the prospect of an integrative element working across disciplinary cultures . Culture as content seems to point , on the other hand , to different answers for different kinds of educational programme , and even begs the question as to whether it makes sense in some subject domains . The other point is that , while I have distinguished between the culture of the academic community and the cultural dimension in the student 's educational experience ( and this book is mainly about the second of those ) , there has to be a strong connection between them . Logically , and as a matter of fact , the quality of the student 's experience is affected by the character of the life of the academic community .",0

"However , it was the evaluators ' impression that the dispute coincided with a certain demoralisation amongst panel members which had more to do with the disorganisation and instability of the panel itself .

"2.1 Symbolic Processing — the new approach to computing When skilled maintenance staff carry out actions , such as fault detection , testing , diagnosing and repair , they do not do so by solving sets of mathematical equations . Instead , they choose symbols to represent the problem concepts ( knowledge ) i.e. an understanding of how the system works , and then apply various techniques and heuristics ( rules of thumb ) to manipulate this knowledge ( Fig . 3 ) . Symbols are a string of characters ( i.e. ‘ machine’ , ‘ fault’ , ‘ 0.6’ ) used to represent real - world objects and properties associated with them . They can be linked together into relationships , representing hierarchies and dependencies .",0
"From this formulation change in society will flow , not from the autonomous actions of individuals acting subjectively but from fundamental and objective changes in the economic base of society . Individuals acting as politically relevant actors will therefore have very little scope at all to shape the economic base of society or its political and social superstructure . For instrumentalists this is what Marx meant by his classic statement about men making history but not in circumstances of their own choosing . This account is clearly an attempt to develop an objective theory of how society functions , and it delimits the scope for autonomous action by individuals . Unlike pluralist and elitist accounts ? this Marxist theory denies that individuals choose freely and that political action can be based upon their subjective and value - free preferences .",0

"The definition of a component within its own local space , with discrete attachments to other spaces , is seen firstly to conform to observations of the real world . In kinematics the coupling of components is usually described in terms of Reuleaux pairs which attempt to describe the allowable motions between parts . Groups whose motion is curtailed by the maintenance of point or line contact at the bearing surfaces , are sub - divided into higher and lower pairs , respectively . A shaft or bearing may thus simply be described as a rotary lower pair although its detailed motion may be far from simple . This implies that its motion may be systematically reduced to result in only one degree of freedom .",1

"Shakespeare is thought to have been strongly influenced by Spenser in these choruses , for instance , and this might have been reflected in the comments . Equally the nature of the various styles , high , middle and low , needs more elucidation than it gets in this book ( cf . pp . 70â€“71 ) if it is to form a central plank of the discussion of lexis . This point emerges in the discussion of Henry , for the play is said to exhibit all aspects of war , the heroism and the cowardice , and these call forth the high and low styles . But this emphasis is rather distorting for the play as a whole , for it is in danger of reducing the language to examples of one of the three styles . The variety of dialects and registers is not given any attention and there is no discussion of the many features of discourse in the text .",1

"As Sartre had put it in What is Literature ? : ‘ Never has homo faber better understood that he has made history and never has he felt so powerless before history’ . How can man make history if at the same time it is history which makes him ? Sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out by merely eliminating the first in favour of the second , making man a passive product entirely determined by economic circumstances . Unwilling to follow Merleau - Ponty by dropping the second in favour of the first , Sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through the movement of praxis , that is intentional actions which produce material effects .",0
"In the 1477/8 parliament his position there was further strengthened by the exchange of Elfael , which had come to him with the Neville land but which was peripheral to his main Welsh interests , for the duchy of Lancaster lordship of Ogmore , which complemented his holdings in Glamorgan . It is not clear who initiated the exchange , which benefited both sides , but the transaction demonstrates that the king was willing to strengthen Gloucester 's hold on the region , and the result was a compact power base . Ducal influence in the region has , however , been judged remote and ineffectual , a verdict based largely on Gloucester 's inability to get to grips with the problems caused by the decaying system of local office holding . Certainly , by the time Gloucester secured these Welsh estates , the north had emerged decisively as his main sphere of activity . Whereas East Anglia might have become a second power base in the early 1470s , Gloucester 's Welsh lands were never expected to be more than peripheral .",0

"Since for each item there is a 50 per cent chance of a correct response simply by guessing , children with scores of 8 or less on any set are regarded as in need of retesting , while very low scores ( 0–1 ) indicate that the child is systematically misunderstanding the meanings to be derived from word order . The WOCT does not provide age norms , but it has been piloted with groups of normal and handicapped children , aged between 4 and 5 years 5 months , from lower social class backgrounds . Success for the normal children ranged from 82 per cent to 100 per cent , and Fenn suggests that , as a rule of thumb , a child who fails the test should be regarded as functioning below the level of the normal 4- to 5-year - old . Data from 100 deaf and mentally handicapped children showed considerable variability and performance was not related to scores from the Reynell Developmental Language Scales ( see below ) or the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test ( see above ) . This suggests that this test has identified a linguistic skill which is distinct from the linguistic abilities required for success on these other tests .",0

"Germany 's frontier forts The building of small , defensive forts , or blockhouses , is as old as the history of formal warfare .

"As the paper goes on to point out : ‘ The availability of substantial permitted reserves and the effect this could have on implementation in the case of Option II [ on which MPG6 is based]needs to be considered.’ We believe that the industry and the demand it satisfies will have to come under much greater restraint than is offered by the draft guidance before improved efficiency , recycling and use of waste — all options currently more risky and expensive — are taken up in a serious way . If this is to happen we believe the Government must get to grips with the immense problems stored up in the legacy of old minerals permissions .

Until Dane Jacobsen had barged into her life she 'd done pretty well , too , she thought darkly — but he had a peculiar knack of stripping away those carefully constructed defences , to reveal the real emotions underneath . It could all have been so different .",0

"And even though Derry won only one game in the Ulster Minor League , that statistic is causing no sleepless nights within the Oak Leaf county . Championship success is what is high on the agenda and the McGoldricks hope their players can deliver a measure of this on Sunday . Their deliberate , low - key approach means that Derry 's preparations have been carried on virtually behind closed doors but they have nothing to hide . Indeed , they have a lot to show , including the skills of players like Ronan Rocks , Johnny McBride , Damien Hasson , Louis McPeake and Colm O'Loughlin . The ‘ two Johns’ , both from Bellaghy , have paid diligent attention to detail in their team 's preparations and their track record with under - age sides is enviable .",0
"‘ No one 's not going to put on me .’ Anne had continued to visit the Misses Dolan frequently even after Margaret had moved in to look after them , and been very happy to see her old friends so well cared for and so delighted with Margaret 's lively little girl . ‘ It 's a new lease of life for them,’ she told her mother , but just before Sarah became ill Miss Louisa suffered a stroke and was confined to bed , and two weeks later Miss Ellen had a heart attack and was also bedridden . Anne went to offer to help Margaret with the nursing but she said that she could manage . ‘ Thanks , Anne , but honestly they make it so easy .",1
"Immediately under the throne is an enclosure , surrounded by silver rails , in which are assembled the whole body of Omrahs , the Rajahs and the Ambassadors , all standing with their eyes bent downwards , and their hands crossed . At a greater distance from the throne are the inferior nobles , also standing in the same posture of profound reverence . The remainder of the entire courtyard is filled with persons of all ranks , high and low , rich and poor Whenever a word escapes the lips of the King … however trifling its import , it is immediately caught by the surrounding throng ; and the Chief Omrahs , extending their arms towards heaven , as if to receive benediction , exclaim Wonderful ! Wonderful !",1
"‘ Manager Lennie Lawrence appreciated my problem . ‘ It was important that I moved on to a bigger stage , with a club in the top bracket of the English First Division , or Celtic and Rangers.’ A Celtic move set Mowbray up for life financially , and Middlesbrough hit the jackpot with a seven - figure profit for a player from the junior ranks . Yet Mowbray has been dogged by injuries since he crossed over the border . He has played only four games since November .",0
"Even if the Government and Opposition spokesmen are wedded to the idea of having King 's Cross as an interchange for the channel tunnel , they do not have to use the scheme proposed in the Bill . I believe that we should not proceed with the Bill . British Rail should go back to the drawing board , look at the line and the station together , and produce a new , properly worked out Bill that addresses both the line and the station . In his article 169 letter , the European Commissioner stated that it was important that the rail link and the station should be considered together in terms of the environmental impact assessment if the European Community directive , signed by the Government and agreed to by this country , were to be met . One of my constituents was in touch with my colleague , the European Member of Parliament , Ken Collins , who chairs the European Parliament 's Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , to seek his advice on what the European Commissioner had done and the reasons behind his action .",0
"Chemists must not be reactive — they need to be proactive and to reach the coming generation with a positive message that is well presented . A comic gives children the opportunity to retreat into their own world ; it is a very private thing . Children think in black and white , good and bad , and the comic has a powerful influence on shaping attitudes . Perhaps future issues of comics and children 's magazines will again imaginatively present science , and especially chemistry , as beneficial and exciting .

"Tabitha 's headset suddenly locked into an ambient channel and began to tinkle with tinny salsa . Irritated , she snatched out the earpiece and let the set dangle round her neck . She had to get a move on if she was going to make it to the city before noon . Hoisting her bag , she sidestepped a cargo float , waded through a crowd of squabbling Perks and elbowed between two Alteceans and a city guide they were trying to haggle . Stepping high in the light gravity and brandishing the bag before her , she ploughed her way out into the open air .",0
"I look at this from a point of view electioneering . What is the biggest single problem taking up ? I suppose it depends on the family but trying to envisage an average family , on thing that would immediately come to mind erm is probably security . Security in the context , not just of law and order , but security in terms of can they be sure that they have a job next month , in six months time . And part of the reason why we 're not really out of the recession , is that people are not willing to commit themselves to any further expenditure because they 're not quite sure in six months or twelve months time , as to whether they 're going to have anything in the way of a job .",0
"Some horse trainers use this knowledge and ‘ eye - ball’ their horses to intimidate them into performing better in halter classes . On a simpler level , we know that it is unwise to turn our back when we are still close to a strange horse , stallion , or foal , because occasionally it will boot us once we take our eyes off it ! Although horses only see in black and white , which is really varying forms of grey like in black and white photographs , they are much more conscious of colour than we would expect . People who give their horses water in plastic garbage bins of different colours , often discover that their horses drink more water from yellow and orange bins than they do from those of a darker colour such as red , brown , green , and purple . A bad association with a particular colour can disrupt a normally reasonable relationship with a horse .",1

"Reducing a 300dpi image this much effectively makes it 1,200dpi and laser printed artwork is then more than adequate . There is also the added bonus of a large range of typefaces and the ability to mix graphics with the text . Although the laser printed sheet is only in black and white the rostrum camera operator can add the colours optically and generate a very high quality slide for around half what it would have cost to produce using a ‘ conventional’ electronic system . ( Part of the reason for this , other than the high initial cost of the hardware , is that film recorders take quite an appreciable time to image the slide whereas a rostrum camera works as fast as the operator can change the artwork . ) At this point we are in the position that the market had reached just before Apple got interested .",1

"The head of Broadcast Communications , who supply the clean feed , has confirmed that ' there was a little bit of liberal interpretation of the rules on my part ' . As a result , although the coverage is not as lively or interesting as it would probably be if the editors had more freedom , it is not nearly as stilted as many people feared ; it is certainly much better than the terribly restricted and monotonous presentation of the Canadian House of Commons . Viewers in this country do get a fair picture of the debates and other proceedings in our House . The rules for the cameras in committees are essentially the same as in the House , except that it is recognised that it is not possible to exclude shots showing the public , especially those sitting behind the witnesses in a select committee . In practice , there have been no problems .",0
"‘ When exactly was that?’ Morse asked his question in a level tone , his eyes , unblinking , never leaving hers .

"Forget the amber gamblers , I 'm fast becoming a fully fledged red and green gambler , too .

"Penny Dunford on Annette Chevallier 's urban abstraction The Shipley Gallery in Gateshead has a reputation for being both accessible to its local community as well as to those involved in the worlds of art and design . Its permanent collection of fine Victorian paintings often sits cheek by jowl with a varied selection of current art and craft practices some of which also provide opportunities for visitors to participate in . Annette Chevallier 's recent show of paintings occupied one of the rooms in the gallery spilling out into a corner of the Victorian paintings , while opposite was a touring exhibition of European ceramics . Chevallier 's paintings are uncompromisingly abstract .",0

"In respect of past land - take . I feel this is completely unrealistic , because basically er demand has been thwarted by existing land shortages . In a nutshell the approved structure plan seriously underestimated the employment needs of the district , and it allocated only forty six hectare for a fifteen year period . What this means in essence when when you look at the geography of of the district is that it imposes severe restrictions on where you can distribute reasonable sized employment allocations around the district . And the other thing you have to bear in mind is that at the time the original structure plan was drawn up , they were n't talking about the er the structural employment problems that we are at the moment .",0

They seized the opportunity for independence or at least a new bargain with Moscow — regardless of whatever views might be held by the silent masses .",0

"Although we acknowledge that the National Curriculum is presented in a conservative context , and probably has to be couched in conventional terms , we are conscious of its lack of a ' qualitative thrust ' , its inability to cater for all we want to offer all our students . And we are very doubtful about our ability to incorporate our ideas into a crowded programme in our ten - column curriculum with powerful constraints imposed by a heavy schedule of testing and assessment . So we have a clearly articulated philosophy , and we have a curricular model which reflects it — a model which is superior we think to any off - the - shelf models , and we have looked at Bruner , White , Bloom , and at HMI 's areas of experience , all of which lack the coherence and universality of the ' regions of application ' model . Adapting our ideas to National Curriculum requirements But to present the ' regions of application ' model as our only version of the curriculum in our prospectus would be to put us out of business .",0
"Some have a substantial occupational pension , and possible capital accumulation which might allow for the provision of goods and services in a period of dependency . In inflationary times almost every ageing person experiences some anxiety about how their finances will hold out , leading to severe economies over food , fuel , and replacement of clothing and household goods . The level of the basic retirement pension is such that those who rely on it must either live a frugal existence ( Holman , 1986 ) , take part time jobs for as long as possible to make ends meet or claim income support . Poverty is often associated with old age for the longer people live the less the value of their pension or savings , and the greater the expense of providing care in increasing disability ( Townsend , 1979 ; Phillipson and Walker , 1986 ) . As people become more frail there may be increased reluctance to think of applying for income support : 1.1 million people .",0
"That was why it began with rejoicing , and one can regret that it did not become known by its opening words : Gaudet Mater Ecclesia ( Mother Church rejoices ) . The Church rejoiced in its ‘ unity in diversity’ manifested in the various rites that witnessed to the richness of ‘ catholicity’(so often reduced to bland uniformity ) . This would have to be remembered in the rough and tumble of debate . Second , John wanted the Council to share in his optimism about the presence of the Holy Spirit in the modern world . He denounced the ‘ prophets of misfortune’ who see in the modern world ‘ nothing but betrayal and ruination .",0
"There are three inevitable consequences of these very different approaches . One is that the further from a Type 1 structure a school is , the greater the need for communication and coordination in decision - making . The second is that while all primary school decision - making is dependent upon both formal and informal relations and contacts , the more complex structures require a much greater expenditure of time on formal decision - making processes ; at the same time , there is greater risk of divisiveness if groups and individuals feel that they are being excluded from the formal processes or that the latter are less important than informal , behind - closed - doors negotiations . The third consequence is that while in Type 1 structures leadership is synonymous with headship , in the more complex structures leadership is shared among several people . The development of PNP is in part a story of growing sophistication over such matters in Leeds primary schools .",0
"PART ONE POLICIES : MAKING SENSE OF THE INNER CITY Once placed in their political context , it is difficult to imagine a set of guidelines of good practice in urban policy precisely because of the interaction of policy , theory and practice that this volume attempts to emphasise . Yet this begs the question of how policy initiatives should be assessed , given that they regularly embody flawed conceptualisations of urban crisis , were created in contentious circumstances and reflect spatial realisations of a political agenda as much as objectively circumscribed social problems . This section attempts to highlight some of the ambiguities involved in just two of the criteria by which the success of urban policy is commonly measured . The first is that of leverage .",0

"Clearly , the government policies required to make the use of education and health services equitable are a daunting package . They are very costly and they are likely to be resisted by various sections of the community , including some of those who stand to benefit from such policies . Obviously , too , they are policies which will take years of consistent application before they can bear fruit . Taking the discussion one step further to the reduction of inequalities in outcome , one is faced with even more intractable problems . As far as health is concerned , it requires not only the equitable distribution and use of medical services , but also the reduction of inequalities in working and living conditions .",0

"The police ( Old Bill ) are heartily disliked .

"Police enforcement of the traditional code , on the other hand , is in theory not a matter for a mere segment of the population , and except where the police deal with persistent or ' problem ' offenders , their target population is one made up of strangers , given to unpredictable deviance . Left unremarked in the discussion so far is the irony of the place of criminal punishment in a system which emphasizes conciliatory control based upon compliance . This irony prompts the questions which guided the research and which form the central problem addressed by this book : since those who are subject to regulation have good economic reason not to comply , how is compliance secured , given the frailty of the criminal sanction and its virtual disuse ? How is control effected where the law seeks to remedy a state of affairs ? What is the place of the formal legal process in regulatory enforcement ?",1

"And Hume 's point is that it is impossible to have any reason for that last belief . For that belief is not analytically or necessarily true ; no contradiction is implied by supposing it false . And I can not suppose that experience itself has given me reason to believe that the unobserved will resemble the observed , since the appeal to experience begs the question asked ; it argues not to but from the crucial belief that our experience is a reliable guide , or that the unobserved will resemble the observed .

"They had the advantage of providing adequate studio space and being equipped with showers , but other facilities were primitive and the surroundings were not ideal . Below the studio and adjoining the changing rooms and showers ( because the building stood on a slope ) was a ‘ bottle store’ selling alcoholic drinks , and its customers sometimes cluttered the doorstep . Another hazard was that bottles sometimes fell off the shelves because of vibration from above . Adjoining the studio was a funeral parlour with a window opening into the studio , so it was necessary to stop classes and rehearsals whenever a funeral took place . As well as working on his own his ballet , John had his shaky technique to battle with in daily classes , and there were performances to prepare for .",1

First restored in Devon by Buckfastleigh - based volunteers and staff of the 80064 Locomotive Group from Barry scrapyard condition during the 1970 's , the engine will provide a much needed boost to the SDR 's expanding loco fleet .

But for almost two million pounds she not only got up , but got to grips with the crumbling guttering on a Paris rooftop . Risking the loss of her usual cool dignity , and wearing little more than a feather - trimmed tutu and high heels , Linda was filmed clinging to the building and edging along it before plunging , screaming , to the ground .

"At five o'clock next morning , John and Joan Waters returned to Northern Ireland via the Stranraer to Larne ship route .

"Paul suggested a way of getting rid of this passivity , arguing that lecturers should give out notes at the beginning of lectures and then : They could go through them , and then they could encourage a more open thing , and people could — there could be a discussion going on in the class at the same time . This would certainly allow students to participate more in their own learning , and give them more chance to get to grips with complex ideas . In reality , however , the lectures allowed students almost no control ; students were , in some ways , treated like school pupils ; expected to listen and take notes , and accept the authority of the lecturer . As a result , some of them even behaved like schoolchildren ; it was not uncommon , apparently , for students at A to throw paper aeroplanes in lectures — a rather immature ( but possibly understandable ) response to the frustration of endless listening and note - taking .",0

"Those who recognize the imbalances in the Byrd discography can only applaud their continued advocacy of these profound and arresting works some of Byrd 's best music , and therefore among the finest English works of all time . But who has followed their lead ? Above all , what performers sensitive to the original performing context of this music have dug deep into this seam of riches ? Tallis has been reasonably well served by chamber - scale performances , but Byrd has fared less well . One longs for more choice , for interpretations that are truly ‘ framed to the life of the words’(to use Byrd 's phrase ) and not bland rehearsals of the notes , for performances that seek to move the listener rather than explore only the music 's sonorous surface .",0

"While one has to admire the contortions into which employers forced themselves to go to prove that their current practice was rational , coherent and best for all concerned , one feels they do protest too much . The margin of profit Edinburgh master printers made from employing women far outweighed the wages they paid the men who handled the finishing processes . Arguments about absenteeism ( not borne out incidentally by the surviving wage - books ) are hardly relevant when one is talking about piece - work in large firms .

"What they make is ' history ' — events plus a structure of relations . Contrast this with the ways tribesmen made history . The Zuwaya did have two relatively specialized kinds of historian : older men tended to make more history than younger ones , and some poets included historical subjects in their repertoire as well as amorous and religious ones . Poetry was a specialized activity , at least in the sense that few people made or recited poems in public . History in this case was the product of a specialized group ; and the arguments about the quality of the product were about its beauty , metre , wit , rather than about its truth , typicality and meaning .",0
"‘ Either we wash our hands of the country and allow the Communists to overrun it ; or to continue to pour treasure ( and perhaps eventually lives ) into a hopeless cause … at a cost of alienating vital segments of Asian public opinion.’ It was , obviously , a monstrous dilemma and although Ogburn in the State Department was concerned that the Congressional Foreign Relations Committees should not be misled , his suggestion of periodic cocktail parties with non - communist Asians seemed to offer only slight relief . In any event , at the higher level Rusk announced that the independence of the Associated States of Indo - China within the framework of the French Union was now assured , even if this did mean squaring the circle or at least begging the question . A similar attempt to draw attention to an approaching commitment that was so deep that it might even lead to direct US intervention was made by the Deputy Director of the Mutual Defense Assistance Program , John Ohly , in a long and thoughtful paper which he submitted through Rusk to Acheson . Ohly , without being absolutely sure , thought that US foreign policy was wrong and was at least in need of urgent re - examination .",0

"That an event could provide such top quality entertainment and performances , enthralling a capacity 30,000 crowd throughout the 45 tries over two days , speaks volumes for the success of the formula .

"To return to Ditton 's study , skill at fiddling customers was a major criteria or unofficial status among the bread salesmen .

Also , the salesmen distinguished between those on their rounds who should not be fiddled ( such as disabled people , ex - salesmen ) and those who qualified as ‘ fair game’ . This distinction can be seen as allowing the salesmen to defend themselves through providing a justification for fiddling . Of course , this is common to many criminals who define the victim of their criminality as being rich enough to withstand the loss .",0

The other fun competition that I entered was the same idea but it is played in the dark you use a special ball which is slightly transparent there is a hole in the middle of the ball which a lightstick goes through . The lightstick lasts for up to six hours sometimes longer you tee up the ball on every shot so that you ca n't hit the light stick out when this game is played the flags are all lit up with bigger lightsticks .,1

"It was good , everybody had told me that erm , you know , you did n't get very much money when you left school , about ten shillings and to offer me fifteen shillings I thought was out of this world , so erm Wh what did you actually start as ? Well I suppose a very junior clerk , the first job I was given was , well it 's unheard of in this day and age but what they had was what they call a bundi clock and there every driver and conductor had got a key that was inserted in this clock and on it was his personal number , well when he reported for duty , he inserted this key into the clock , turned the handle and stamped on to a piece of paper , a roll of paper , his number and the time he reported and the next day it was my job to go through and record from this piece of paper how many minutes they were late f reporting for duty and if they erm were more than , I think about three or four minutes we had to send them a memo telling them , that 's how things were in those days that people were , they toed the line or else .

"A second difficulty with this most obvious method of testing is that , even if a preponderance of Protestants were to emerge , it would not follow that it was their religious convictions that supplied the motivation for their science . Merton himself was aware of the problem when he raised this question : Merton 's answer was that both processes were at work , but to an unknown extent . The problem in a nutshell is whether particular forms of scientific and religious commitment might not separately depend on ulterior forces of social and economic change . It is striking , for example , that detailed studies of the relations between religious dissent and the promotion of science in eighteenth - century Britain have located the correlation in expanding northern towns such as Manchester where the ulterior forces were population growth , increase in wealth , a certain social and geographical isolation , a zest for political reform , and a concern for moral values prompted by the seamier side of city life . To establish a correlation is not necessarily to establish a connection .",0
"The general trend towards central control , together with the introduction of LMS , which delegates to governors many of the management powers which have traditionally been the responsibility of the local authority , have conspired significantly to alter the role of the local education authority .

"They have to learn in competing with men for recognition and promotion to suppress any signs of feminine ‘ weakness’ . Tears must not be allowed to fill their eyes and under no circumstances run down their cheeks . The male mafia will close ranks and deem such a woman unstable , neurotic and quite unsuitable for responsibility . If she has a male boss who has tantrums that would be more appropriate in a three - year - old , a boss who shouts at and bullies her , in the institutional world of male values , she will lose all respect if she cries . She may know that her tears will relieve her tension more effectively than shouting back or pretending not to notice , or they may be tears of anger rather than the vulnerability so despised by her colleagues .",0

"Couples can also request one of the clinic 's booklets for their GP which explains how to get the same tests on the NHS .

"Her lodgings at Chapel Street were a palace in comparison with this place and Summer Lodge a far - off dream of perfection .

She saw to the side of one of the houses the faded sign for Morgan and family , boot and shoemakers , fastened over what appeared to be little better than a shed . Surely Hari Morgan would be only too grateful for the opportunity to get away from such an unprepossessing background ?",0

"To pick and choose which plants they were going to eat would put them at a disadvantage since they would waste so much time looking for food , rather than eating it . The poor quality of most of the mountain goat 's food , together with the specialised digestive system required to cope with it , imposes a strict daily routine on the animals , which varies little throughout the year . A bout of feeding early in the morning is followed by a lie down during which they chew the cud . This is followed by a midday feed and another rest , which is in turn followed by a prolonged evening feed . This pattern of alternate feeding and resting is characteristic of all grazing animals .",0

"And the more he succumbed to the allure of his own Führer cult and came to believe in his own myth , the more his judgement became impaired by faith in his own infallibility , losing his grip on what could and could not be achieved solely through the strength of his ‘ will’ . Hitler 's capacity for self - deception had been profound ever since the mid-1920s , if not earlier , and was vital in order to carry conviction among his immediate entourage about the greatness of his cause and the righteousness of his path towards attaining it . But as his success within the Movement , within the German State , and on the international stage grew until it knew no bounds , so the self - deception of the ‘ conviction’ ideologist magnified to the extent that it ultimately consumed all traces of the calculating and opportunist politician , leaving in its place only a voracious appetite for destruction — and ultimately self - destruction . In this sense , the ‘ Hitler myth’ was a fundamental component of the underlying instability of the Nazi regime and its untrammelled dynamic of destruction . It would have been expecting too much to imagine that the once - mighty ‘ Hitler myth’ might disappear overnight in 1945 , disintegrating along with the mortal remains of the Führer himself and being scattered with the ashes of the Third Reich .",0

I can see them there as in a picture when , for the last time , arthritis having finally prevailed , they sat quietly together in the sun contemplating a magnificent crop of potatoes spread out to dry — the final gift of that bounteous old garden .

""" I 'll have Miss Ernestine Baker 's dress shop , "" she said .

"There is no time for Celtic to lick their wounds . On Saturday they face League leaders Rangers , who are four points ahead of them with a game in hand . ‘ There has been much talk that Rangers have the title sewn up but we still have 58 points to play for and that makes it ludicrously premature to suggest that the destination of the title is cut and dried,’ said Brady .

"So far this accords with almost any interpersonal situation which produces problems between the persons concerned . But , when younger people are involved , their own problems are too easily and often seen as somehow less valid than those of others involved . It is sometimes necessary to invert one 's own view , one 's own attitudes and even one 's own moral values in order to get a clear picture of the total situation . Because of the wide diversity of outlook on sexual matters between the generations , the necessity may be particularly marked where sexual considerations exist . This is not to say that the child or young person is always right ; it is , perhaps , to say that he or she is seldom completely wrong .",0

"Dare one say that the England pack , in the defeat of Ireland , had these attributes to a greater extent than the Wales backs in the defeat by France ? You have to start somewhere — but where ? When John Ryan became Welsh coach in 1988 , the shattering tour of New Zealand having instantly expunged memories of the first Welsh Triple Crown in nine years , he had no compunction about picking old - style tight forwards who , if they did nothing else , would scrummage till the cows came home . Neath , the leading Welsh club side of the moment , were more or less ignored because although their forwards could get around better than anyone else 's there would not have been much point if they could not win the ball in the first place . The result : division , geographical and stylistic , and so balefully profound that Neath supporters were quite happy to see Wales lose at home to Romania .",0
"What must be certain is that their problems will be heard and evaluated . Personnel review procedures Some undesirable employees will always slip through the net ; and some employees will change over time . Thus , for personnel practices to be truly effective , employees should be continually observed and periodically rechecked , especially those in sensitive positions such as systems programming . Supervisors should be trained to be observant and sensitive to the needs , morale and problems of employees subordinate to them , and must be aware of the proper channels through which specific problems may be detected and dealt with .",0
"Nevertheless they are constrained from deploying the usual wind - up techniques by their overriding concern to justify their actions and attitudes to someone who disapproved of them but whom they perceived to be in a position to influence their situation for better or worse . So we have a rehearsal of grievances centring on the injustices they feel they have suffered as a result of black immigration into the area . The element of playing to the gallery is conserved in the way they portray the fight as a piece of street theatre , with the adults cheering them on from the balconies , while the girls offer silent support , as the boys defend the honour of the white community against the ‘ black invasion’ . In this way they achieve the desired effect of both showing off their street fighting skills and justifying their moral commitment to racism , while positioning me , alongside their parents and girl friends as admiring spectators of their ‘ protection racket’ . Of course while they may be imagining that they are bending my ear and creating a good impression , they are also providing me with the kind of evidence I am looking for about the gendered and generational aspects of this kind of racism .",0

"Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand . The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs . By 1983 it had half that number on roll . Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities . In addition the Elfreda Rathbone organisation , a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities , ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties .",1
"In other works , the pictures represent a record of the highly eroticised and mythological meeting of the artist and his model . The exhibition text coyly notices : ' Some artists acknowledge that the close presence of the model brings an added tension to their work ' . But in the context of the modern cultural mythology of the artist / model relationship , this statement simply begs further questions and plays on the frisson of sexuality activated by the exhibition . The objects on display in The Painted Nude are full of quotation and convention . A number of the pictures place the model in the traditional pose reclining on a bed or sofa .",0
"What motivated Louis was neither political weakness nor a suddenly - discovered conscience . He was posing as a new Theodosius , evoking the "" happy Christian emperor "" who had performed penance for a political massacre , made his peace with his critics , and won the praises of St Augustine in The City of God . Louis too was determined to wipe the slate ritually clean of recent conflicts , in order to secure agreement for a new disposition of power within the royal family .

"John Lennon and Yoko allowed the world 's media into their hotel suite in Amsterdam for their bed - in , a honeymoon to epitomize the institution of love not war . Mick Jagger put on a charming little Greek skirt and gave a free performance to thousands in London 's Hyde Park , while Bob Dylan headed down to the Isle of Wight for a three - day festival of dope , sex and rock ' n ' roll attended by 150,000 fans . It was the wildest party Britain had seen , and the media had a field day with a revelling of nude and painted bodies , cavorting to fine music under a dense cloud of cannabis smoke and punctuated by the occasional screams of an acid drop gone wrong . For those in the middle of these events , there was in addition to the tension and the menace , a certain air of unreality ; this raises the part played by drugs , not merely in the emergence of a forceful counter - culture , but in the attitudes of plain straightforward young people to whom any kind of illicit substance a couple of years earlier would have been a complete mystery . Drugs provided the wherewithal for the actual suspension of reality — a route so desperately sought , for instance , by those young men wearing American uniforms in that far - off land of Vietnam .",1

I promise you that I will continue to listen and where I can I will do my best to respond to the wishes of the ideals of and the aspirations of this movement that I hold so dear . The opportunity to serve you and to meet you over the next twelve months I look forward to enormously and while I 'm not conceited enough to think that I can move mountains in the year ahead , or naive enough to think that I can please everybody fully , fellow Tablers I promise you I will not let you down .

"The first two landing stages touched by the excursion ship after leaving Brunnen and heading south into the Urner See are part of the story . After rounding the imposing sheer cliff face of Seelisberg , it is rather surprising when the boat draws inshore to moor at a little pier with no sign of village or community in sight . The landing place is for a meadow lying on a shelf or terrace beneath the cliffs : the Rutli meadow where representatives of the three founding cantons met in 1307 to take a solemn oath confirming their Everlasting League to defend the liberties their valleys had inherited against tyrants . The next landing stage , this one at a tree - covered spur projecting from the opposite shore of the lake , bears the sign "" Tellsplatte "" ; nearby is a memorial chapel to the folk hero who is reputed to have leapt ashore at this spot escaping from an Austrian - manned boat that was carrying him to prison . The Tellsplatte lies at the base of the Axenberg mount , part of the precipitous east face of the Urner See .",1

"More important , as armies became more highly organized , more permanent and more self - conscious , the temptation to use them as moulds in which civilian societies might be recast became stronger , at least in the relatively poor and backward States of Eastern and Northern Europe . In these a clear tendency developed to militarize society in general in the quest for greater political and economic efficiency . This bore fruit in Peter I 's Table of Ranks of 1722 ( see p. 50 ) , itself based largely on Swedish precedents , and in the subjection in Prussia of the administration and much of the economic life of the country to the needs of the army . Finally many of the checks on the ferocity of West European warfare did not exist , or were less effective , farther east . In the West most eighteenth - century campaigns were fought in densely populated and wealthy areas .",0

"Wright 's second strike — surely a candidate for goal of the season — saw him turn Everton defender Matthew Jackson first one way and then the other before lofting the ball over the head of Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall in the 78th minute . Wright 's first goal in the 49th minute followed a flick - on from Kevin Campbell , and Wright rifled the ball low into the net past Southall . But before those two goals Arsenal had made heavy weather of things in a first - half that they dominated , with Wright sending a header and a shot over the Everton bar . Southall made a series of fine saves in the first - half , the most notable a 20 yard drive from Arsenal defender Nigel Winterburn which took a wicked deflection causing Southall to dive smartly and push the ball away for a corner . It all changed in Arsenal 's favour when Paul Merson came on as substitute after the interval .",0

"In a traditional adventure story the pursuit of personal honour is drawn to an absolute conclusion . The hero is vindicated as a character completely realised , uncontradictory even when(as so often in Stanley Weyman , for instance ) he steps aside from the path of correct behaviour .

"For Ho Chi Minh , formerly ‘ Nguyen the Patriot’ , it was an accolade that corresponded to reality but of all the ‘ objective circumstances’ which might be held to account for even a temporary communist victory in August 1945 at least the most striking and immediate was the political vacuum into which they moved . The general insurrection was proclaimed on 14 August by the Central Committee of the Vietminh . It was , they said , the moment for the people to rise up in arms and obtain independence , and even though this begged the question against whom they would use these arms , there was no doubt , as the Central Committee said , that it was a moment of exceptional opportunity . A fortnight later they announced themselves as the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and a few days after that , on 2 September , as the climax to weeks of stupendous political demonstrations , Vietnam declared its independence .

"Hitchcock 's intentions were even more obscure than usual when he was making Marnie . A notably successful example of a glass shot ( see page 44 ) appears in the Powell / Pressburger version of Rumer Godden 's 1938 novel , Black Narcissus ( 1947 ) , which centred on a small group of nuns in the Indian Himalayas . Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger had previously worked on original scripts ; this was the first of four novel adaptations , of which The Small Back Room ( 1949 ) , the only one in black and white , was paradoxically the best , though they were the supreme colour artists of British cinema in the 1940s and ' 50s . To the disappointment of the crew , who fancied a trip to the East , Powell decided that India would be recreated entirely in the studio . The veteran German designer Alfred Junge produced some marvellous designs for the settings , particularly the convent , a former ‘ house of women’ or quasi - harem on the verge of a precipice , that won him an Oscar .",1

"People 's vulnerability at this time can be very great , and it is a poignant reflection on our society that there are many other people ready to prey on this . They have devious ways of making money from bereaved people 's misery , whether by knocking on the door after a death , offering to clear the house for cash , including any objects of value ; or by offering solace in exchange for cash or fees . It seems a reasonable rule of thumb that any genuine offers of help and support from people or organizations will be accompanied by a name and address , and a willingness to be checked out as to their motive in making contact . It is inevitably a part of the normal grieving process that people search for the dead person in a multitude of ways , but it is very necessary for friends of the bereaved to help them choose carefully . It can be one of the most helpful and long - lasting things that a friend can do .",0

"Although the Hexams ' Thames - side tenement , a former mill , in Our Mutual Friend , is in itself atrocious —'roof , and walls , and floor … alike had a look of decomposition ' — it is the effort to make the place a home —'a small dresser , making a spare show of the commonest articles of crockery and cooking vessels ' that is drawn to the reader 's attention .

"There is , in particular , the introduction of two French saints within the text : St Leonard ( I. 7 ) , a sixth - century hermit from near Limoges , and St Denis ( I. 38 ) , the first bishop of Paris in the sixth century . Since other versions of the weeping bitch tale are known from the continent , and France is unquestionably home to the fabliaux , the divergent descent of the known Dame Sirith and the Interludium from an English descendant of a French source — perhaps an Anglo - Norman play text — rather than the one from the other looks most likely . It is generally assumed that both texts on British Library Additional MS 23986 are preserved there as fragments of longer originals , and this is certainly true of the Anglo - Norman ballad first written on the roll . Regrettably this manuscript has been lost within the British Library for the last twenty years , and studies of it at present have to be based on photographic records . The text of the Interludium ends , at the end of a sentence , about half an inch from the bottom of the roll , leaving space for at least three more lines of text .",1

"Even we visiting foreigners – all dutifully clad in blue Mao suits and caps – were expected to attend regular political “ study sessions ” to purify our bourgeois minds with proletarian tracts written by the Gang of Four . That trip set an indelible baseline against which I have since been able to measure all the changes China has undergone . As Deng ~ Xiaoping began to encourage individual incentives over the next several decades – embodied in such slogans as , “ To Get Rich Is Glorious ” – I watched with wonder and amazement as China ’s private economy began to rise from the ashes of Mao ’s revolution . As this process unfolded , it became fashionable for market fundamentalists in the West to bask in a sense of vindication . After all , were the scales not falling away from the eyes of Chinese leaders , and were they not now turning for salvation toward the God of capitalism that they had once so militantly denounced ?",0

The difficulty I think that we 're facing , is that it 's happening in year two of a four year transition period , before we 've really got to grips with what the long - term position is , what the overall demands are , and to what degree we are going to be able to model , change , control and , and influence those demands . Erm , so it is , how shall I put it , erm , unfortunate I think , in , in Shropshire 's view , that they did n't continue along the distribution on the previous basis . Those two put together , I think we lost about three hundred thousand pounds as a result of the change in distribution .",0
"I have very little confidence in the ‘ reforms’ being introduced with such a fanfare this month . Rather than eliminating NHS under - funding and the resulting problems , I think they will increase the bureaucracy , without any guarantee of better patient - care .

In London 's East End , people , especially the elderly , are often ill - fed , ill - housed and ill - clad , as well as being plain ill .

"A new film Give My Regards to Broad Street achieved extra significance on 30 September when all pleas for a reprieve were rejected , and the North London mausoleum closed its doors to passengers and awaited total demolition . It was bad enough having to admit that the APT train project was a dead duck , but BR shot itself in the foot and provided the cynical national media with a field day by selling off some of the vehicles to a Sheffield scrapyard . The strict rules of disposing of redundant vehicles by public tender was forgotten for the rest of the stock , dismantled very much behind closed doors at Derby Works . By 1989 InterCity director Dr john Prideaux was reassuring his customers that it was wrong to regard the APT as a failure ; it had indeed been a great design success ! Unfavourable train reliability statistics are easily shrugged off until one of your passengers is a VIP .",0
"As is so often the case , the transition from arms to feet is more difficult than expected , but a careful combination of undercutting , balance and barely breathing should see you right .

"Somehow , in the confusion of rapid troop movements , El Cid never succeeded in joining with the royal army , though he certainly attempted I to do so . Yusuf , who had returned with a smaller force than before and doubted the strength of his Spanish allies , abruptly withdrew . Alfonso was victorious without striking a blow ; and his anger at the failure of El Cid to join him knew no bounds . Egged on by Rodrigo 's old enemies , the Ordonez , he again pronounced a judgement of exile — this time backing it up by confiscating all El Cid 's lands and goods . He even went so far as to imprison Rodrigo 's wife Ximena , and his children ; and though he soon released them he refused to listen to El Cid 's demand to settle his innocence by right of combat .",0

"This information is then used to profile each area and identify the principal characteristics of the neighbourhood . Financial behaviour data , such as that from Infolink 's consumer credit databases , may then be set alongside the geodemographic data to identify household financial profiles . The combination of Census geodemographic and financial profile of each name on the Electoral Roll . Whilst such systems are powerful tools for marketing analysis and direct marketing campaigns ( indeed , such profile codings have been shown to be highly predictive when incorporated into credit scorecards ) , the credit marketer should never lose sight of the fact that these are likely profiles and there will inevitably be a small proportion of targeted customers whose actual profiles display a disparity from the system profile . This highlights the importance of individual credit screening of those applying for credit following a marketing campaign .",1

"Today , too many Latin governments , fearful of the media 's ability to expose misdeeds , have altered their tactics but remain determined to limit press freedom . Latin ~ American journalists may face a diminished threat of murder nowadays , but many still confront a gauntlet of challenges designed to control them . Behind closed doors , governments wield financial incentives and regulatory powers to mute media criticism and twist editorial content in their favor . Without a critical press , Latin ~ America 's undeniable advances toward real democracy – development of an informed , empowered citizenry and governments respectful of the legitimate boundaries of power – will be endangered , even as formal electoral trappings become more routine .

"For example , a general election for the House of Commons must be held at least every 5 years but only certain people have access to the vote and not all votes for different parties are of equal power in the absence of proportional representation making for a close correspondence between votes cast and seats won ; the House of Lords ( once a very powerful state institution ) can now only delay bills passed by the House of Commons ; the Prime Minister "" must "" come from the Commons ; and it is "" expected "" that a government will resign and call a general election if it is defeated in a vote of confidence on the floor of the House of Commons . 2 The constitution is actually in politics . No constitution is ever safe above the rough and tumble of political life . It is often the focal point for fundamental conflicts . It is , therefore , subject to change at moments of political crisis as particular interests scramble to shape the constitution and the rules of the political game to their own advantage .",0
"Whether the performance indicators relating to these issues are relevant is more difficult . At such a high level of aggregation , for an annual period , and reported some months after the financial year , it is not easy to see how most customers would change their behaviour because of them . Taxpayers , at least through the political process , might find such hard data useful , as broad rules of thumb to confirm subjective perceptions about performance . If this were true then the fact of having to report the indicators may encourage managers to achieve their targets . In the context of punctuality of trains , it may also encourage the targets to be adjusted .",0

It is true that the Irish have not genuinely embraced the fitness revolution and the real impact of the fitness factor is witnessed in the unpleasant sight of what fit teams are doing to Ireland . It was after the 1990 England v Ireland game at Twickenham that Paul Ackford casually mentioned to one of the Irish players that his team knew it had only to withstand Ireland 's 20 minutes of blood and guts to win easily . That was the game in a nutshell . England won without fuss . And it has been that way for five seasons .,0
"She also has a grandeur of style that does not preclude tenderness and anxiety as emotions within its expressive range . In the Aida solos we meet with some likely misgivings : there 's quite enough , for instance , of that glottal manner of production ( cf .

In La Willy , Adriana Lecouvreur and Tosca , the sheer sound is gorgeous , but the first and third lack emotional intensity . ‘ In questa reggia’ is ( I believe ) a mistake and probably a dangerous one : there is n't ice in the voice , and its glory lies much more within the tessitura of the Forza Leonora than this .",0

"Although such an attribution is important in terms of nationality , it loses information where health beliefs or possible variations in cultural practices are concerned . Consistent ethnic monitoring of both births and deaths is needed to provide accurate information on the local variations in the incidence of sudden infant deaths . This in turn will allow the recognition of high and low risk groups , and so the possibility of identifying high and low risk practices . If British born people of minority ethnic extraction are invisible in statistics on sudden infant deaths ( or any other areas ) we lose the chance to identify accurately both health trends and the health practices that may be associated with specific morbidity or mortality . The availability of the 1991 census data on local populations by ethnic origin offers a timely opportunity for ethnicity — like occupational class — to be systematically recorded .",1

"Parent / Subsidiary Relationships Perhaps the most important commercial change since the invention of incorporation itself has been the rise of groups of companies with interlinking control and ownership .

"With the inferential approach it is clearly necessary to have a good understanding of the psychological processes involved in performing the test procedures we use and good theories of those processes themselves . Good psychobiology , using the inferential approach , requires good psychology . Using ‘ natural’ units of behaviour is not without its problems as it begs the question as to what constitutes ‘ natural’as well as sidestepping the issue of why particular parts of the nervous system are important for particular behaviours . Since behavioural methods are central to psychobiology they are tackled first in this chapter . We then turn to the main techniques for studying the physiological side of the equation , lesions , stimulation , and recording , looking at the sorts of problems that affect our interpretation of experiments .",0

"Chamberlain ( 1989)(using a simplified version of Garman and Klass ) found some limited support for the Samuelson hypothesis . He examined only two FT - SE index futures contracts , March 1985 and June 1985 , and a significant maturity effect was found for only the June 1985 contract . Board and Sutcliffe ( 1990 ) found clear evidence supporting the Samuelson hypothesis for index futures , but this occurred only when the high and low prices were used in the volatility measure . Since studies of the volatility - maturity relationship for other assets have found much more support for the Samuelson hypothesis ( even when the high and low prices are not used in measuring volatility ) , this suggests there is something different about the volatility - maturity relationship for index futures . The available evidence does not provide clear support for the Samuelson hypothesis for index futures , and the studies using implied volatility suggest that volatility declines as delivery approaches .",1
"It has been held that volenti will provide a complete defence in actions against the police or hospital authorities where the deceased was of sound mind . If the deceased 's judgment was impaired by mental illness and he was incapable of coming to a balanced decision , his act is not voluntary and volenti will not apply ( Kirkham v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police [ 1990]3 All ER 246 ) . This approach seems to beg the question as to whether a suicide can ever be regarded as being in their right mind . The issue of voluntariness also arises in the rescue cases . A rescuer who acts to save a person in danger and is injured , can not be said to exercise the free choice which is necessary for volenti .",0

"‘ Where there is a danger of eutrophication in this country,’ says the government , ‘ usually the limiting factor is phosphate , and not nitrate ; if confined this would mean that zones would not therefore need to be designated to prevent eutrophication.’ For scientific assessment of a subtle ecological issue such as the causes of eutrophication , it is important that the information used to decide policy is openly available for scientific debate .

"Yes . for libel . There are various exceptions erm and there have been two or three in recent years , but it therefore meant that they were fair game for saying anything so they were fair game for a very sensational headline because there was very little chance of recrimination . Mm . Now the view er was that they were dignified and above taking action and also in the sense that the public was credited I think with more sense than to believe everything and that the public memory is relatively short and therefore if you start a court action and you then have coverage in the court action , you are merely making the thing worse erm sometimes the things that some people may have thought were highly actionable one day , become almost a joke and something of affection later on and you can , one of the classics maybe is about the Prince of Wales talking to his plants , now that a national joke and he will make jokes about it in speeches",0

He died on October 8 last year and at his funeral hundreds of his schoolfriends , his football squad and his local pals came to mourn him .

"Evidence of the existence of dry rot may be found in a musty smell pervading a suspect space ; the presence of a whitish cotton - wool - like fungal growth on timber ; cracking and bulging of joinery mouldings such as skirtings and door linings owed to the shrinkage of hidden fixing timber which has been attacked by the fungus ; and readily apparent ravaged timber showing deep cracks across the grain , giving a ' cubed ' appearance . Once dry rot has been discovered , the only remedy is extermination of the fungus together with the rectification of the unhealthy conditions which invited the attack . The fungus has no heart nor ' Achilles ' heal and unless it is completely destroyed to its limits , it will develop fresh strength and start again to devour the timberwork . There are two possible strategies for the treatment of an attack of dry rot . The building owner may either employ a builder to carry out the work or opening up and eradication , or he may call in one of the numerous specialist firms to deal with the attack .",1

"KINGSTONIAN manager Chris Kelly could face a charge of bringing the game into disrepute over his outrageous comments this week . I understand the Football Association are monitoring his outburts closely and could be forced to act if they continue . Earlier this week , Kelly accused the FA of bringing the game into disrepute by ordering his non - League club to replay their FA Cup first round match with Peterborough behind closed doors tomorrow . The replay was ordered by the FA after K 's goalkeeper Adrian Blake was felled by a coin thrown from the crowd during Peterborough 's 9 - 1 replay win last Wednesday .

"This pair is especially rare being the maker 's only known double - barrelled pistols ( est . in excess of £ 50,000 ) . A wheel - lock rifle of circa 1680 is signed by the ivory sculptor - gunstocker Johann Michael Maucher of Schwäbisch - Gmund ; although well represented in museums , Maucher pieces make rare appearances at auction . Overlaid with delicately carved plaques of high and low relief ivory and inlaid with engraved mother - of - pearl , this gun crosses the boundary between a scientific instrument and a work of art ( est . in excess of £ 60,000 ) . The most eccentric gun must be the wheel - lock rifle with its barrel encased in glass . Signed and dated 1688 , it is extraordinarily rare , especially in such good condition ; there is another example by the same maker , Johann Gsell , but that one , unsurprisingly , retains only a fragment of original glass,(est . £ 15–20,000 ; part II of sale ) .",0
"But at least the mystery was nearing a solution — even if she had no idea why Luke Hunter should want to go out to dinner with a woman whose sole contact with him up till now had been violently centred somewhere round the solar plexus .

"The new union began nevertheless with some advantages . Of these perhaps the greatest was that at a stroke all the feckless local officials of whom Wilson complained so bitterly had been removed . Financially the slate had been wiped clean . Wilson , whose own competence left something to be desired but who had learned from experience , had already centralised the finances which he had accused branches of the old union of frittering away . The new general secretary , Ned Cathery , was an experienced and trusted colleague , having joined the union in September 1887 at the age of 35 .",0
"In desperation Mr Gresty turned to soldiers at nearby Catterick Garrison who agreed to recover the truck stuck in the River Skerne , on the outskirts of Darlington .

And the £ 170,000 military breakdown gear made light work of pulling the battered truck out of the waters .

"The tendency is either excessive restraint ( Europe ) or a diffusion of the effort ( the United ~ States ) . Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro , whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms . For geo - strategists , however , the year that naturally comes to mind , in both politics and economics , is 1989 . Of ~ course , the fall of the house of Lehman ~ Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin ~ Wall .

"‘ Musicals are jolly . You know when you sit down in your seat the performance is going to be uplifting and you will leave the theatre humming a cheerful tune.’ That was certainly the philosophy during the times of economic crisis in the early Eighties when the original run of Barnum played to packed houses , and when the National Theatre hit the jackpot with its first musical , Guys And Dolls . Psychologist Dr Glen Wilson , author of The Psychology Of Performing Arts , believes an evening of song and dance can actually change people for the better . ‘ Musicals give a direct emotional lift,’ he says .",0

"In a similar way the French crown was able to make good use of the experience of such men , the Valois intervention in Castile in the mid-1360s , under the leadership of du Guesclin ( who understood their mentality well ) , being based largely on the services of these mercenaries . In the fifteenth century , the freelance soldiers had an important part to play in the war . Henry V and his son employed some whose names can be spotted on muster rolls , not infrequently fulfilling a specialist capacity , especially in the artillery trains . François de Surienne certainly showed himself capable of independent activity before throwing in his lot for some years with Henry VI , whom he served before being elected a Knight of the Garter . But it was in the French army of the first half of the century that the mercenaries were most prominent .",1

"Although all organisms show adaptive behaviour , for it is a necessary condition of existence , many highly successful life forms have managed very well without the capacities to learn and remember — even without brains . Think of a sunflower turning its flower head towards a source of light — and therefore of energy . The sunflower does not learn by experience to turn its head more effectively as it matures , or not to turn at all if it is repeatedly electrically shocked every time it does so . The flower - head turning behaviour , adaptive or not , is a ' given ' property of the organism , fixed within its genetic and developmental programme . Such a given behaviour ( innate is the conventional term , but I prefer to avoid it if possible , for it carries along with it a load of redundant ideological baggage ) ensures that appropriate responses are made to particular stimuli without the need for trial - and - error learning , but at the expense of limits to both the range and the flexibility of the response .",1
"THE SMALL £ 5 in the corner ( as in pay no more than ) is a good introduction to Sofa Head 's second album , and inside it shrewdly builds on the foundations set by last year 's ‘ Pre Marital Yodelling’ . The most immediately noticeable different from their debut is that Claire 's vocals sound wholeheartedly more agreeable when she 's not being forced to shout along at breakneck speed and ‘ What A Predicament’ allows her space to work within its range of varied musical styles . Sofa Head 's greatest asset is the realisation that you do n't have to set your sights on one target . So , from the all out thrash of ‘ Invitation To Dinner’ the album veers through the enchanting ‘ I Can See You’ , where Dr and the Medics meet The Alarm ( I kid you not ) , to the dark , disturbing ‘ Come To Daddy’ , a frank account of child abuse with nightmarish male vocals and Clair taking the role of the innocent child to chilling effect . There 's even a touch of dub reggae in ‘ Fill’ , and an intriguing finale which includes smart cover versions of The Doors ' ‘ Break On Through’ and Suzanne Vegas ' ‘ Luka’ .",0

"Such combinations constitute formulaic patterns which are indeed of very frequent occurrence in language use and need to be accounted for ( as I mentioned in Chapter 3 ) but they can hardly be said to represent the total language to be taught . Grammar is clearly central to the working of language . But it is equally clear that its nature can not be accounted for by demonstrating its rules by a random use of any lexical items that come to mind . I have suggested that it enters into some kind of relationship with words and contexts . Grammar is not just a collection of sentence patterns signifying nonsense , something for the learner 's brain to puzzle over .",0

"He had his little peccadilloes , the quaint and rather Machiavellian ways to gain his little ends , but he knew me and I knew him , and in essentials he made good.’ And when Lugard came to look back on what had been accomplished in the early years of British administration he singled out the improved character of the native rulers , which he attributed to ‘ the unceasing efforts and devoted ability of the British staff , who have by precept and example made them what they are today’ . The inconsistency of demanding frankness and openness from the African while practising a form of government depending largely on influence wielded behind closed doors seems not to have troubled the British ; they assumed that it was precisely their own qualities of straightforwardness and transparent honesty which would effect the required transformation in the African character . As was usual with the rulers of the British empire , moral display served a dual purpose , being intended not only to improve native character but also to stimulate native loyalty . It was always Lugard 's assumption that his reception by the emir of Kano as his ‘ honoured friend’ owed as much to the emir 's respect for his qualities of character as to gratitude for the restoration of his own eminence .",0
"Although he bought Jenny a £ 2,000 diamond engagement ring and happily re - settled in his Brentford mansion , his scoring prowess deserted him after a vicious tackle by Stoke 's notorious Chris Kamara left McAvennie with a broken leg , an injury that kept him out of first team football for months . McAvennie threatened to sue Kamara but dropped the idea when it was established that the injury would not end his career . Kamara had no great love for Scottish strikers ; in April 1988 he made legal history as the first English League player to be fined in court for an on - pitch assault . The Swindon Town hard - man was fined £ 1,200 for attacking the Scottish striker Jim Melrose , breaking his cheekbone in three places . Followers of Scottish football know only too well that a lapse in form and a broken leg are often the precursor of disasters to come .",0

Charlotte , her eyes on Albert who was taking her attention , asked him rather half - heartedly to desist , but the boy threw the ball out of the window . It hit the platform fence and ran under the carriage ; as quick as a flash the boy darted past Charlotte and Albert and tried to look for it under the wheels .",1

"A star close to the limiting magnitude ( 22 ) of the Schmidt plate lies roughly 0.7arcsec to the west of the radio position .

At a distance of 150pc , the distance modulus is 5.9 magnitudes providing a lower limit to the absolute magnitude of the companion of about 16 whether or not the candidate star is the binary companion .

"Without prevention , they have no options if they get sick .

"Jon Thompson has n't done any investigative homework in accepting Celant 's list of artists and repeating the familiar texts . By the historical designation of this alternative practice as ‘ sculpture’ , when intentions were anti - sculptural , he manages to exclude women a second time over .

He might be legitimising Goldsmiths ' current practice ( in which , ironically , women are very active participants ) and he might be pandering to a new Europeanisation … but the notion that Arte povera , in this limited manifestation , is ‘ representative of a crucial revolutionary moment — even of the last possible revolutionary moment’ is a load of cobblers .

"Kavelin had caught the empress with the second number in her hands as early as August 1857 , and by the end of 1858 the head of the Third Department was passing copies from the tsar to Prince Menshikov .

Although the first issue for 1858 welcomed the Nazimov Rescript with a banner headline , and although Herzen freely acknowledged that Alexander II had earned his place in history by setting the process of emancipation in train , by May 1858 The Bell had restarted its pressure for emancipation with land and soon it was insisting that much remained to be done before the process of reform bore fruit . Thus Herzen , in London , filled the gap created by the government 's response to the appearance of Kavelin 's essay in April . Meanwhile , reformers within the bureaucracy were coming into their own because they were concentrated in the ministry whose expertise was now at a premium .",0

"DAVID MELLOR has gone to the back benches nursing the belief that since he told John Major all about his expenses - paid holiday it made it okay and if life were fair none of us should have considered him out of order . Much the same thinking goes on with the directory of Members ' Interests . As long as an MP declares he or she is on the take these payments somehow are deemed acceptable . So not only can a back bencher shout the odds for the fur trade , the police , the bookies or whoever in exchange for money but worse , the chairman of the Home Affairs Committee can be on the payroll of a private security firm without anyone thinking there might be the tiniest conflict .

"‘ The workforce thus comes to view employment in the firm as a permanent career , and it sees its future as intimately tied up with the fate of the enterprise’(Gallie 1978 , 18 ) . In sharp contrast to Blauner , who argues that this ‘ objective integration’ will lead to social integration of workers and management , Mallet argues that this objective integration has the opposite effect , leading to a new form of revolutionary consciousness that aims at the overthrow of the existing pattern of social relations in the enterprise . A major reason for this is that the high productivity of fully automated plants satisfies the basic consumption needs of workers but , instead of this leading to a high level of satisfaction , workers freed from the immediate concern of making ends meet are then able to pose what Mallet takes to be the more fundamental problem of their alienation from their work . Their ability not only to begin to understand the nature of their alienation but to learn to do something about it is also enhanced by the development of automation . The job security which Mallet , as we have already indicated , assumes will follow the introduction of fully automated plant gives workers the opportunity to develop a substantial knowledge about the firm and its activities .",0

"Swing - doors on either side of the box - office in the small foyer led to an inner foyer , carpeted and dimly lit . On brown walls there were large framed photographs of the stars of the thirties : Loretta Young , Carole Lombard , Annabella , Don Ameche , Robert Young , Joan Crawford . There were cigarette burns on the carpet , and here and there the brown of the walls had been rubbed away to reveal a pinkish surface beneath . There was a kiosk which sold confectionery .

"This was the main value they attributed to school work experience rather than seeing it in any direct sense as preparation for engineering work . Richards 's conclusion is that : According to these employers it was teachers who needed WE more than pupils , so that they could get a picture of what engineering was really like ( as opposed to media misrepresentations — strikes , redundancies , etc . ) and so put across a ' good image ' of engineering , hopefully attracting the ' brighter pupils'into the industry . ( ibid . , p. 11 ) As far as the actual content of the education was concerned , the employers wanted no more than a solid , old fashioned grounding in ' the basics ' and that ' bright pupils 'should be positively encouraged to seek jobs in the industrial sector rather than in the academic world or public services .",0
"Despite the fact that relief trailers were provided for the homeless they remained empty due to the lack of available land on which to site them , yet the government refused to take over corporate land even for humanitarian purposes . From this disaster a coalition of community groups throughout the region was formed , calling itself the Appalachian Alliance , and with these groups placing questions of land ownership high on their agenda for discussion , the issues were raised to a new sense of awareness . In Appalachia , as in other areas of the world which we are increasingly becoming aware of , there has been a growing pressure for small - scale hill farmers to diversify their income with non - agricultural work , or else to sell out and move due to the increasing financial burden of trying to make ends meet . In addition there has been a growth in the promotion of tourism , which with its low pay , seasonal employment , and upwardly spiralling speculative investments , has also brought pressure upon people to leave the land . ‘ To a great degree , the reason for the contrast of wealth amongst poverty lies in the ownership and use of the land .",0
"One of the authors summarized the position in the words : ‘ Since 1922 we have come to recognise more and more that chemotherapy in the sense in which Ehrlich introduced the term , is more of a dream than a reality’ . In England Almroth Wright was expressing similar views . Happily , such pessimism was dispelled a decade later , when the study of bacterial chemistry began to bear fruit . For anyone studying the biochemistry of microbes , mycobacteria must have offered a mixture of attraction and discouragement . The genus was sufficiently unlike other bacteria to arouse curiosity .",0
"The idea of the lofty Naylor Massingham sitting impatiently outside her apartment block for an hour was one which Leith found quite pleasing — so much so that she almost broke into a smile . Resolutely she held the smile down and , since he was being so aggressive , her own tone was short as she snapped nastily , ‘ What are you doing here anyway?’ ‘ Do n't be shy — call me Naylor!’ he thundered , and suddenly Leith 's sense of humour got the better of her , and she burst out laughing . He seemed arrested by her laughter , she saw , as she watched his glance go from the merriment in her eyes to her laughing mouth . And then , even while she was making valiant efforts to control herself , because for certain he was going to set about strangling her at any moment , after some seconds of looking at her as if staggered , suddenly , and to her amazement , he was seeing the funny side of it also — and he was laughing too !",0

"The Case for a Global Financial - Transaction Tax BERLIN – What went wrong with global financial markets ? In a nutshell : the implosion of the brave new world of modern finance , and the economic crisis that followed , was rooted in the idea that free and unregulated capital markets always work for the public good , and are all that is needed for economic prosperity . The prologue to the crisis was a combination of cheap money , deregulation , and a race for returns by executives undeterred by the associated risks . When the housing bubble burst and financial markets collapsed in its wake , growth slumped worldwide as never before since the Great Depression .",0

"The fall is real enough ( remembering my earlier distinction between real and literal , p. 36 ) , and to take out the story of Adam and Eve is to make a terrible hole in the gospel . It also creates serious difficulties for the theological understanding of Christ as the second Adam . We can all be too clever by half , and it is wiser to take the gospel story as it is revealed to us and presented throughout the whole of the sacred text of scripture . To reject the mythological character of much of the Bible is to run the serious risk of looking for the truth of scripture as if it were like the kernel in the nut , and ending up with nothing but the shell . Is this not what happens to Bultmann 's programme for freeing the authentic message of the gospel for modern man ?",0

"Eggs , for example , were traditionally sold loose from wooden crates or boxes , and the customer took them home with great care in paper bags . In 1953 , when eggs came off the ration , Sainsbury 's introduced a four - egg pack . It was attractive with a fresh , clean image but was not sufficiently robust to withstand stacking on shelves and customer handling and was replaced three years later by the ' France Oeuf ' carton . This was a considerable improvement , providing good visibility and protection for the eggs as well as being sturdy enough to withstand machine - filling .

"11 If the year of our folly 1990 had started inauspiciously for me , then the Fates , Lady Luck , Lord Chance , God , Life , Evolution — whoever or whatever — immediately thereafter set about the business of proving that the entangled disasters distinguishing the year 's first few days were but a mild and modest prelude to the more thorough - going catastrophes planned for the weeks and months ahead … and this with a rapidity and even an apparent relish which was impressive — if also bowel - looseningly terrifying — to behold . Gav and my Aunt Janice got on like a house on fire , a combined location and fate I occasionally wished on them as I lay awake listening to the sounds of their love - making , a pastime I sometimes suspected I shared with people in a large part of the surrounding community , not to say northern Europe . I had made the mistake of volunteering to sleep on the couch in the living room on the nights that Janice stayed at our flat ; this offer was made with what I thought was obvious sarcasm one evening while Gav and Norris were attempting to develop a technique for cooking poppadoms in the microwave . They were having an intense and appropriately heated discussion on the problems of cold - spots ( as evinced by the fact that their first attempts came out looking like braille roundels ) , and on the unfortunate instability of three poppadoms balanced together — caused not so much by the jerk they received when the turntable started up as by their movements while they cooked and swelled — but eventually my flatmates settled on the concept of standing the things up individually on the glass turntable , and so instigated what they termed a ‘ brainstorming session’ in an attempt to find a suitable support mechanism .",0

"As for Monica Seles , her desire to play at Wimbledon this year , coupled with the fact that she already has the Australian title under her belt , might be all the incentive that she needs to go for that Grand Slam this year , that same Grand Slam which she passed up last year with her refusal to play the British leg of the four majors . Jennifer Capriati reached the semi final in 1990 and the quarters last year . Now older and perhaps a little more clay - wise , with a win already this year over Monica Seles at Key Biscayne and with her father Stefano as her coach once again , she may well be settled enough to go all the way for the first time , which of course , would be a remarkable achievement for a 16 year old . In 1991 , she won more matches on clay than any other player,(24 ) , and she had the fourth best win / loss record of all players on that surface,(24/3 ) , with a percentage success rate of .904 , although it should be noted that , in 7 attempts to date , she has been unable to overcome the dominant hitting of Seles . However , if the draw is kind to Martinez , she could must make the final this year and then , who knows ?",0

"What interested me was how the editorial approach to these readers compared with the neighbouring ad : ' A weak Gordon 's & Tonic ( please do not adjust your magazine ) ' , it said , wetly . Agencies too easily assume that the competition for the brands and services they advertise comes from other advertisers . On the shelves , this may be so .

"You often have those . And she likes hearts and crosses , or there 's everlasting stripes,’ and she spread her hand wide . The boy , however , took no notice of her but raised his eyes to the bottles on the shelves and said , ‘ Acid drops.’ Agnes did not make the mistake now of asking her customer how much he intended to spend on the acid drops ; she reached up and took down the jar and , tilting it , tipped some acid drops into the scale ; then , putting the glass lid back onto the jar , she returned the whole to the shelf before once again blowing into a small paper bag and depositing the sweets inside . Now , once more looking at the small boy , she said briskly , ‘ Come , make up your mind quick , Bobbie ; I know you 've bought a shipping order tonight but there 's this lady and gentleman waiting to be served.’",1

"Commitment to the war also determined the Unionist response to Lloyd George 's disputes with the generals in the winter of 1917–18 . Sympathy was with the generals rather than the Prime Minister , hardly surprisingly in view of past events , but sympathy never went far enough to weaken Lloyd George 's position greatly . Haig was saved from dismissal by defenders on the Unionist side , but Robertson 's removal caused a small stir , and Unionists voted in force to save Lloyd George 's face in the Maurice debate . It was doubly difficult for Unionists to resist the substitution of Sir Henry Wilson for Robertson , for Wilson was the most Unionist of all the General Staff and Robertson had not enjoyed good relations with Unionists ; Derby 's weakness at the War Office and Law 's loyalty to Lloyd George were sufficient to defuse the situation . The dismissal of Haig would have been much more serious , but with Law 's advice Lloyd George did not take the risk .",0

"I think — it really begins in the home this because it 's — mothers can do quite a lot in not educating their own sons to think of them as servants . A lot of women do this . They are very tolerant about boys ' mess in the home and untidiness generally , and in a sense they lay the foundations right from the very beginning of boys growing up to think of women as kind of household servants — this attitude , you know , boys will be boys and they make a mess and poor mum has to do all the washing . It 's really quite misguided because it does encourage those assumptions that mothers are there to tidy up after sons and of course then sons when they grow up and get wives want to replace their mothers . So women themselves can do something about educating men in the home , starting with their sons .",0
Even now many families on Cape Verde depend for their existence on money sent back from relations working abroad . This was brought home to me after witnessing the rapturous welcome given to about a dozen young Cape Verdians as they carried their enormous radios and bottles of duty - free Scotch to their waiting loved ones in the airport arrival lounge . They celebrate the return of their not - so - prodigal sons in some considerable style . The economy of the Cape Verde Islands has been precarious ever since the Portuguese discovered the uninhabited archipelago around 1460 . The European settlers gradually increased in numbers and additionally brought over slaves from the Guinea Coast thus bringing pressure to bear on the already sparse natural vegetation .,0

"Firstly , for many it can help to control body weight because regular , vigorous exercise lasting for at least 20 to 30 minutes increases your energy output and helps you use up body fat . Regular means at least three times a week and vigorous as anything that leaves you slightly breathless , but not gasping for oxygen . Secondly , exercise can increase the amount of HDL , the ‘ good guy’ and lower the total amount of cholesterol you have in your blood . An editorial in The Lancet ( November 10 , 1990 ) entitled ‘ Who 's for tennis?’ but which could have just as easily been entitled ‘ Who 's for running?’sums up the present state of the art and looks particularly at a new piece of research carried out on civil servants .

"Sir Thomas Kerr of Ferniehirst and Sir John Forster told conflicting stories in the subsequent enquiry . Ferniehirst was removed from office on English insistence , and gradually calm was restored .

William Armstrong of Kinmont , a celebrated reiver or raider , was among the Scottish representatives at a meeting at Kershopefoot in Liddesdale , where the English frontier runs down the middle of the Kershope burn to its junction with the Liddel Water , and then south down the Liddel .

"Some of thus music was written in a hurry — no less than four works ( K168–71 ) were composed in the single month of August 1773 — and in any case the style is hardly personal , nor is the quality striking . Indeed , the late Hans Keller declared in The Mozart Companion ( London : 1956 ) that ' on the whole , Mozart 's early quartets are quite abominable … why play them at all and thus insult Mozart 's genius ? ' Though we need not go along all the way with this characteristically provocative view ( and even Keller found ' a few playable exceptions ' ) , I confess to wondering whether this is not one of those issues motivated less by musical need than by the pious opportunism of which we saw so much in the bicentenary year . The five quartets on the first CD ( K155–9 ) are in three movements , the others in four . The players of this Hungarian ensemble , formed in 1985 , use period instruments tuned to A=421 , nearly a semitone down on modern concert pitch .",0

"There was no reply . Perhaps it had n't been a good idea after all to come on this trip together .

"This means that in the case of fish some of the blood must make two or three trips around the lung circuit , and some carbon - dioxide - bearing blood makes several trips round the body before returning to the heart . In the reptilian heart most of the blood gets round the body on the first circuit , but with the four - chambered heart — in mammals , birds and ( imperfectly ) in crocodiles — the blood from the two circuits is not mixed at all . It is as if the body had two hearts — one providing power to the lung circuit , and the other for the body circuit . This system gives the animal much more speed and stamina . Several commentators theorize that dinosaurs may have had hearts like crocodilians , perhaps because they are the closest living relatives to the archosaur .",1

"The ancient Penny Hedge ceremony , which dates from feudal times and has been promoted in recent times by the English Tourist Board , takes place in Whitby tomorrow .

PENSIONERS in East Cleveland could be coming in from the cold as far as weather payments are concerned . Langbaurgh Coun Steve Kay has persuaded the Department of Social Security to take another look at the way the area is divided for cold weather payments .

"If one is still searching for ways to explain this absence , believing with most ethologists , socio - biologists , and even some social anthropologists that aggression is part of human nature , then the obvious place to look is for some form of ritual as catharsis , or try to identify some other culturally constructed behaviour pattern which allows the individual Chewong to shed negatively valued arousal states , like anger , which according to such theories would build up and erupt in uncontrolled violent behaviour . Not only have I been unable to identify any such ritual — it would , for instance , be incorrect to interpret the shamanistic seance as practised by the Chewong in such terms — but other practices , analogous to eskimo dog beating as presented by Briggs ( 1970 ) are equally absent . However , I would argue that it begs the question to phrase it in such a way . I do not disregard the possibility that some rituals in some societies do indeed perform such a function , but this interpretation would be meaningful only if the members of those societies could be shown in their various ideas and practices — in particular those concerning personhood — to endorse such an interpretation . In other words , let us avoid a priori assertions about human nature and try instead to perform a systematic explication of indigenous ideas concerning human nature and social and cosmological relationships .",0
"Nothing raises hackles quite so much as the question of access to the countryside . The vast majority of our land — mountains , moors , lakes and rivers — is owned by a handful of individuals , private and public companies , trusts and associations , most of whom seem hell bent if not on totally excluding , at least on severely restricting our freedom to roam . Some of the landowning agencies that are most restrictive are those which might be thought to be answerable to the public , or have their best interests at heart : the Forestry Commission , the Ministry of Defence and sometimes even the National Trust come to mind . Few walkers can have escaped the experience of finding their right of way barred by locked gates , barbed wire , standing crops , grazing bulls , farmers with dogs or keepers with guns . Luckily we have the example of rights won for us by our forebears whose fight is continued by the Ramblers Association .",0

"Its pleasingness rests purely within the intrinsic aesthetic since the similarities intended are of a purely visual nature . As a result less effort is required for its enjoyment and the resulting pleasure , although being more immediately available is also more superficial and more quickly exhausted . From the above brief outline of work attempting to get to grips with the character of aesthetic response it can be seen that it is both complex and ‘ multi - layered’ , a term used by Greger ( 1972 ) to describe how multiple meanings come to attain a feeling of significance by being grasped at the threshold of consciousness . In the process of ‘ coming to know’ , present experience is condensed with similar sensations from the past through which they are relived , thought about and felt . Partial meanings become more clearly comprehended and relationships are articulated in a way that allows a work to be ‘ unpacked discursively’(ibid ) .",0

"Provided there is sufficient interest , tenders should also result in certainty of sale within a defined period .

On occasion one hears of unusual circumstances surrounding tenders , where neither the vendor nor tenderers are present to affirm that everything was above - board .

"The smaller the SD in relation to the mean , the more scores cluster around the mean with relatively few high or low scores . Alternatively , a high SD indicates that more scores from the sample were substantially higher or lower than the mean . The shape of frequency distributions for sets of scores with relatively high and low SDs is shown in Figure 8.2 . From Figure 8.1 it can be seen that , for all tests with symmetrical distributions of scores ( known technically , and rather confusingly , as ‘ normal distributions’ ) , any score which differs from the mean by two or more standard deviations will be unusual and therefore worthy of further consideration .

"Economically , because of its low annual rate of inflation — 2.9 % — and good trade figures , the franc fort policy should succeed in resisting the currency speculators . If so , French bond yields will deservedly move closer to Germany 's . But the speculators have tasted blood and could yet force a devaluation of the franc . A key reason for the upheavals in the foreign exchange markets is the disparity between the short - term interest rates ruling in the US and the much higher ones obtainable in Germany , where the Bundesbank is battling to slow the growth of money supply and curb inflation following the higher than expected costs of reunification . At a time of few exchange controls , vast sums of money can be freely moved around by companies , investment managers and individuals to obtain the best return and seek the safest protection of capital .",0

"Thus , reviewing the Zande material in the light of our widening experience , we can again detect what may be seen as a main morality religion ( the ancestor cult ) co - existing with a subsidiary , or ancillary , marginal witchcraft cult .

In the Lugbara case , the ancestors make no bones about their direct administration of the moral code : if you do not toe the line they quickly bring you to your knees with a few sharp , salutary lessons .

Punishment affords them little pleasure and they seek to maintain an untarnished image of uncompromised benevolence .",0

Try a sample first over about 150 needles . Knit a few inches background .",0
"‘ It would be unfair to criticise him,’ he adds . ‘ It 's just the nature of his guitar playing.’ But does n't three guitarists in the space of three albums beg the question that Chadwick might be just a little hard on his sidemen ? ‘ No , I do n't think so,’ Guy says . ‘ I just have very specific ideas , and I 'm quite forceful about them .",0
"Voice over Wrestling may have lost its Saturday tea time slot on the telly , but the fans still love it and they pack in to watch when there 's a show in town ; and some show it was too this week . Topping the bill was Dangerous Dan the fire eater , but it was the finish that brought the house down . It 's called a Battle Royal . That 's 12 fighters in the ring .",0
The problem is that we lack virtually any faith . The problem is a lack of virtually any faith at all . What we need is not enormous confidence that we can move mountains as if they were molehills . What we need is not that grandiose . What the text says is that we are to have faith as a grain of mustard seed .,0
"They say their children should be , should be brought home immediately . er Parents predicament is understandable , there have been many tragedies in the past where local authorities perhaps took too much notice of the parents and too little of the children . Some of the cases where children lost their lives , Jasmine Beckford , Kimberly Carlisle , Tara Henry , where somehow the child 's need has slipped through the net . It 's important to get the balance right , so we will be looking to make sure that the policies and procedures , not only follow our guidelines with regard to the welfare of the child , but do also make sure that the parents are fully involved er and informed about the process as it moves through . You 're listening to the Fox Report .",0
"With effect from 1 December 1990 the entirety of England and Wales became an area of compulsory registration . Registered land conveyancing is delightfully simple , both as to deducing and investigation of title , and official forms are obtainable that , with minor adaptation , will serve in all but a few cases . Compared with unregistered conveyancing , the reduction in responsibility and mental anguish is notable ; moreover , by no more than lifting the telephone you have at your elbow , in the Land Registry Enquiry Department in Lincoln 's Inn Fields and in every District Land Registry , a friendly and expert service , which can usually answer "" off the cuff "" any questions that perplex you . 2 .

"My job is to implement our mission , to promote a thriving and effective voluntary sector . By providing leadership , representation and support . In a nutshell , I see N C V O as something like , perhaps , the C B I of the voluntary sector . Well , we 're here in this building , perhaps we have some differences , of course , we ca n't quite match the C B Is resources , but who knows . Through our membership we represent an enormous range of voluntary sector interests , and as you can see , from our electoral college headings , such as Education and Training , Employment and Leisure , Ethnic Minorities , Health and Disability , Income Maintenance and Poverty , Personal Family Services , Planning an Environment , women , you , professional learners society , public bodies trusts and foundations , my goodness what a list .",0
"The UK version of the enterprise came out well before Christmas under the title Europe : A History of its Peoples ( Viking Penguin , £ 25 ) . But the testimony from the High Street is mixed , to put it mildly . I finally ran a copy to earth , with some difficulty , at Penguin 's own bookshop in Covent Garden , and telephone enquiries to a selection of London 's larger booksellers indicated that two out of three had at least one copy on their shelves . But the Economists ' Bookshop , near the London School of Economics , which seemed the most likely to be interested in such a topic , failed , after an extensive search of its microfiche catalogue , to find any trace of it . Which seems to bring us right back to the question we started with : is Europe actually marketable ?",1
"I use a punchcard roll and began by punching out the customary two rows of holes for the overlapping join , only to find that the first row stretched the plastic slightly , giving a wavy edge . On this occasion I simply punched out an extra row of holes and cut away the damaged edge . However , then I hit upon the idea of finishing the card by punching out four rows of holes and cutting between them , so that two rows remained on the blank roll ready to make the start of the next card when required . This completely eliminates the problem without wasting any card ! Dear Anne ,",1
"Home was a casserole dish for a week until I purchased the usual bowl which many goldfish start off with . It then graduated to a plastic tank complete with gravel and plastic plants . The fish jumped out of the tank on a few occasions , landing on the carpet , but was always returned to the tank in time . I knew nothing about fish , but as time went by , I went mad and bought a 24″ glass tank with a crude external filter . Then I moved house .",1
"The running of multiple sessions has been another means of saving which , though not always a problem , has led to truncated teaching sessions , late - coming and absenteeism on the part of teachers and pupils . Teacher absenteeism is also exacerbated by general shortages of goods and services : teachers , like other employees , can spend half their days chasing scarce consumer goods for their families , instead of being in the classroom . Many also have second or third jobs to make ends meet . The SHAPE education reform project The SHAPE project , launched in 1985 , grew out of the educational reforms proposed in the late 1970s but never systematically carried through because of the economic crisis .",0
