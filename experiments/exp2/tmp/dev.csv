"She was sharp . Clive had got so used to being able to fool everyone in this circle that he was unnerved by her obvious clear - sightedness . The rest were wrapped up in a fog , from drugs or cracked minds , but Anne knew exactly what was going on . Of course , there were some things she could not know about . She had got him on Mr Skinner , though .",0
"Major has been embarrassed by unauthorised revelations : about his engagingly eccentric brother , Terry , who still bears the family 's original surname , Major - Ball ; and his sister Pat , now retired and in straitened circumstances , who was once taken to court for failing to pay the rates . Oddly , as foreign secretary , Major asked his old school , Rutlish Grammar , to deposit his records in Surrey county archives and keep them secret ; later , as Prime Minister , he was to claim that he could not remember how many O levels he had . But his background is more mundane than the rags - to - riches story , recounted in numerous tabloid hagiographies , suggests : his circus - artist father was a small businessman by the time Major was born and both his parents were Conservative voters . His family slipped down the social ladder when his father 's garden - gnome business collapsed , but that could explain Major 's obsession , less with classlessness than with petit bourgeois respectability . At 13 , he watched Macmillan deliver his Budget speech in 1953 on a trip to Westminster , courtesy of his local Labour MP , Marcus Lipton .",0
"She was all too horribly aware of the traitorous reactions of her own body as her breasts , covered only by the thin material of a sweatshirt , pressed against his naked chest . The scent of shampoo , clean and tangy , still clung to him , but there was another more masculine note to the aroma , a note that made her heady with its faint hint of warm male skin . His kiss was like no other she 'd ever experienced — not a caress , but a declaration of possession , as though he was staking a claim to something that was rightfully his . Shannon tried to resist his plundering lips , tried to pull her face away , but she could n't think straight , could n't clear the confusion fogging her mind . All she knew was the assault he was launching on her mouth , his lips commanding , his tongue playful yet deadly serious .",0
"But he must , surely . He 'll be pinning his faith on Henry and his autumn parliament to raise the money for the young man 's ransom , no doubt . Should you , by some far chance , rub shoulders with him again , Iago , let him know his brother is well healed of his wounds , and in good fettle . He had a zealous nurse,’ said Owen , and laughed at some thought of his own . ‘ And will you let them go for ransom ?",0
"She felt grubby , tired and , now that the car had pulled up outside the cottage , sickeningly tense . Which , she reminded herself , was ludicrous . The thought made her feel slightly better , but she still found herself tentatively letting herself in , relieved in a way that André was a bit under the weather . It was all futile . Piers was in the living - room as they walked in , half naked , the top button of his faded jeans undone .",0
"The special party congress , staged under the auspices of the 25-member ‘ working committee’ that has taken over the functions of the Communist SED will last through the weekend . It had initially been planned for next week . The congress — taking place in an atmosphere of extreme vindictiveness among the SED rank and file following the corruption revelations — will determine the future of the Communist Party . Representatives are due to elect a completely new central committee and politburo , but the party newspaper , Neues Deutschland , suggested yesterday that such ‘ Stalinist institutions’ would perhaps no longer be required if the SED was transformed into a ‘ truly democratic party’ . The emergency SED leadership pledged that the congress would break with the ‘ Stalinist system’ .",0
"Mr Jones , who was accompanied sub - officer James Gibson , said it took ten minutes to complete the rescue operation . Fire engines from Darlington and Middleton - in - Teesdale also attended the scene . HARRIET Harman yesterday staked a claim for Labour as the party for women whose needs she said had been ignored under 13 years of Conservative rule . Speaking to a Labour party rally in Darlington the shadow health secretary accused the Government of letting women down with inadequate child care , pay discrepancies between the sexes and an all - male Cabinet . The 300-strong crowd of party supporters warmly applauded her when she argued Labour 's policies would give a fair deal to women .",0
I mean all this sitting on the fence I mean they must have very sore bums .

"In normal times , deficits crowd out private investment ( and perhaps crowd in private saving and/or foreign capital ) , and hence reduce future growth . By contrast , in a deep , long - lasting recession , with the central ~ bank ’s policy rate at the zero ~ lower ~ bound ( ZLB ) , a well - timed , sensible fiscal response can , in principle , be helpful . But the political process may generate poorly timed or ineffective responses – focused on transfers rather than purchases , infra - marginal tax rebates , and spending that fails cost - benefit tests – that do little good in the short run and cause substantial harm later .

"The market value of Treasuries depends on a wide range of factors . Now it is essentially sustained by a Ponzi scheme , with the Fed 's policy of "" quantitative easing "" keeping the price of Treasuries artificially high . But , at end of the day , no currency can defy the laws of economic gravity . The market price of Treasuries eventually will fall to levels dictated by US economic fundamentals . For decades , China has been investing its vast savings abroad , waiting for greater efficiency in domestic investment allocation before starting to dissave .",0
"Other Forum activities were started but not brought to significant conclusions . The programme on communication and theology , for example , produced some excellent results in Latin America , North America and Europe . Some papers have been published , others are now being sifted , with a view to making them available to WACC 's constituency . WACC also showed a certain interest in the problems of the ‘ electronic church’ , both in North and South America . But there was no need to break new ground .",0

"Even more worrying , what did Jennifer and her parents think at seeing her with David and at hearing Belinda 's announcement ? To her surprise there was a calm , almost bland expression on Jennifer 's face , while her parents seemed more embarrassed then shocked . Quickly she turned her head to see David 's reaction to seeing his ex - fiancée again after such a long time . Once again , however , she was surprised to find very little response to what she had feared would be an explosive situation as David remained apparently impassive after the initial courtesy greetings . No one seemed to know what to do next , or what was expected of them , and in the end it was David himself who took control .",1
"We did what we could to help him but I am afraid it was little enough . I lived for months with real friends who loved England and could not get enough to eat from her . Unemployed members who had only two shillings a day came twelve miles by train to attend street corner meetings , or to undertake office duties , spent the surviving pennies on food , and walked home into the small hours of the morning in winter weather . These unknown men were great patriots . They all had the hope that out of their sacrifices a greater England would be born .",1

"The best way is to ignore the ring structure and explore the city in chunks that are easy on the feet and brain , keeping in mind your position with respect to the old city plans where it is relevant . This book covers six journeys within the city , all of them — with a few minor exceptions — staying within the boundary of the old city walls . There is much to see , and hopefully the detailed instructions and maps will prevent you from getting lost .

"In a sense this is what it is to become and experienced teacher rather than a novice . One has to develop routines to cope with the situation because it is far too complicated a situation to be handled in any other way . You just can not pay attention continuously to all the different variables in a situation and remain sane at the end of the day , you have to develop routines and techniques for handling it . Now if anyone asks if you feel for any sense that perhaps some of these routines have perhaps got a bit of become inappropriate in some way , perhaps because you 're teaching a different type of child , or perhaps because you 've got rather different educational aims , they 've changed for some reason , then it 's like asking someone to go back to being a novice again in some senses to change . Now this is a very , very difficult thing to ask anyone to do .",0
"Mother — another sandy person , with pretty green eyes — would nod to herself when she heard the phrase , as if in recognition , and smile a little secret smile . Personally , there were things other than the Unknown I would have preferred to confront . But there 's no doubt this activity stood Alec in good stead when he finally came across the truly Unknown .

"Tessa looked disapproving . ‘ Do you cook and clean for Mr. Bell?’ she asked . ‘ Oh yes , darling!’ said Mrs. Mounce , turning her head upwards and sideways , so the smoke from the cigarette in the corner of her mouth missed her eyes . ‘ I 'm just the skivvy round here !

"The men become the claimants and the women their dependants . They lose control over both the revenue and the expenditure , often with catastrophic results : rent not paid , fuel bills missed , arrears mounting . It is conventional wisdom among advice agencies , local authorities and fuel boards that it 's the women who pick up the tab for men 's mismanagement . I heard a housing association official who visited a northern Women 's Aid refuge for battered women being asked if she could help a woman who 'd just arrived , eight months ' pregnant , with two black eyes , find a place on her own . She said,""I've rehoused women on their own before .",0

"MILAN – Around the world , policies , technologies , and extended learning processes have combined to erode barriers to economic interaction among countries . Pick any indicator : trade relative to global GDP , capital flows relative to the global capital stock , and so forth – all are rising . But economic policies are set at the national level , and , with a few notable exceptions like trade negotiations and the tracking of terrorist funding and money laundering , policymakers set goals with a view to benefiting the domestic economy . And these policies ( or policy shifts ) are increasingly affecting other economies and the global system , giving rise to what might be called “ policy externalities ” – that is , consequences that extend outside policymakers ’ target environment . Of ~ course , such externalities have always existed .",0

"If I had used words , I should have had to think more carefully about what I was doing . I was , so to speak , keeping the secret even from myself .

"Robert had won the battle , Basil had to win the peace ( and seems to have done so ) . Basil had first been asked to stand as President in 1982 but declined , however he was asked to reconsider this in 1983 . Recognising there appeared to be substantial support for this move he approached Robert Naish privately with a view to easing the inevitable changeover . However , an election was fought , and there could only be one winner . Ironically , Robert Naish was already unwell and sadly died in February 1985 but not before he and his wife were made Life Members and he had opened the new extension ( a larger lounge and a new men 's changing block ) on August 27th , the previous year .",0
"It would be better in the ordinary case , where the justices think there should be no contact , to say there is no order for contact , which , in fact , is what the family proceedings court have done in the present case . The fundamental point in the appeal , however , does not depend on that issue . The court has made a direction to the local authority that the guardian ad litem be allowed to have continuing involvement with a view to making an application in due course if thought appropriate . There is nothing in the Children Act 1989 which provides for the court to tack any direction on to a care order and I have to say that , in my judgment , the addition of a direction of any sort to a care order is a fetter on the local authority plans , authority and responsibility . Under section 22(3 ) of the Children Act 1989 the local authority has the duty ‘ to safeguard and promote the welfare’ of children in care and , in my judgment , responsibility for the care of the child is firmly with the local authority once a care order is made .",0

"As a result , strikes have been limited , either in number as in BR , or in duration as in RENFE ( see below ) . But there has been an additional weight put on the avoidance of strikes in Spain , reflecting a deep concern with social consensus as a prerequisite for the consolidation of democracy . In both countries , the nature of railway work provides the workforce with a number of weapons short of strike action , notably bans on overtime and rest day working , and the work - to - rule . The latter is particularly appropriate to the railways with their highly bureaucratic , rule - bound organization and their emphasis on safety embodied in complex systems of regulations such as the ‘ Rules for the Observance of Employees’ in BR or the ‘ Reglamento de Seguridad en la Circulación’(Safety Regulations for Railway Traffic ) in RENFE . In RENFE , work - to - rules have often taken the form of safety campaigns .",0

"Police studies The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 extended police powers with accompanying safeguards . One argument over the Act concerns the adequacy of the safeguards : civil libertarians maintain they are too weak while rank - and - file police lament the burden of paperwork and bureaucratic routine as an impediment to effective crime investigation . The safeguards are primarily internal processes of police management , supervision and discipline . Some observers see this as a deficiency : others maintain that effective control over use of police powers must necessarily involve day - to - day supervision .",0

"What other relationships might exist between demographic and economic trends ? There were some suggestions that a lower rate of population increase , from the decline in the UK birth rate after 1964 , was a cause of economic decline , as it reduced demand for the purchase of consumer durables . An analysis by Reddaway ( 1977 ) of the period 1961–71 showed that this view was wide of the mark ; only 3 per cent of the purchase of motor cars and television sets in this period was attributable to population increase . The rest chiefly reflected greatly increased levels of per capita demand , in the consumer revolution of Galbraith 's Affluent Society ( 1958 ) . Four - fifths of households already had a television set by 1962 and the figure had grown to 98 per cent in 1988 ( with 53 per cent having added a video recorder ) .",0
"Thousands of homes and businesses were cut off by two fires at exchanges in Liverpool and Sheffield last month depriving them of all telephone services , including emergency 999 calls . Alfie Kane , BT 's director of network operations , said : ‘ Crippling the 999 phone service in this way may sooner or later lead to the death of innocent people who can not gain access to emergency services , and it is in everyone 's interest that these people are caught.’ Engineers are still working around the clock to restore services at the Woodhouse exchange in Sheffield following a fire on October 25 , which affected 13,000 customers . A blaze at the Wavertree exchange in Liverpool a week earlier hit 13,500 homes and businesses . It took eight days to restore normal service in the area .",0
"Teachers report a common range of such self - indulgences : allowing yourself ( in the middle of a bad patch ) to give in to temptations like cream cakes , cigarettes , a bottle of your favourite booze or a spending spree . As with the other strategies , though , there will be some people for whom this advice is inappropriate : for example if they are unable to avoid feeling guilty , or if the risks involved feel just too great . People with members of their family who are or have been alcoholic may , very understandably , be too scared of ‘ hitting the bottle’ themselves to allow even a temporary licence in that area . People who are under medical direction to lose weight or quit smoking may likewise be quite rightly unwilling to give in to their impulses . But it is a matter of realistically weighing up the pros and cons .",0

"In short , it seems inevitable that most PC software will need some kind of re - write to run on the Portfolio , and some of it will never fit at all .

"I think the game I think the game has done well in tackling that problem but I do n't think we as a society have done very well in tackling it in the country at large .

"His hands , however , were so frozen he could not hold on or get back .

The owner subsequently found out his customer 's identity , and having no doubt as to the use to which his vessel would be put , informed the British Customs . We then had a stroke of luck as Filden I broke down in Dieppe and the owner was sent to see if he could locate the trouble . Continuing his co - operating with our department , the owner contacted us and it was arranged for one of our Investigation officers to accompany him to Belgium in the guise of a mechanic . This enabled the movements of Filden I to be monitored closely from the time she left Dieppe .",0

"So , what will the New ~ Year bring for exchange rates ? While the only safe bet is continuing high volatility , we are at an unusual juncture where the short- and long - term trends appear to be very different . In the short run , the yen and the dollar continue to benefit from a flight to safety , as panicked investors seek a place to hide . The yen and dollar are also being bolstered as central ~ banks elsewhere continue to cut interest rates towards zero , territory that the yen and dollar policy rates already occupy . Thus , even though the United ~ States and Japan will not be raising interest rates anytime soon , lower foreign rates still make the dollar and yen relatively more attractive .",0
"‘ All vaulting ideas of film as an art had to be abandoned,’ remarked George Pearson . ‘ Only as a capable and speedy craftsman could one survive in that feverish and restless environment.’ Pearson made no fewer than eight quota films in one year at Julius Hagen 's Twickenham Studios , where one small stage was occupied around the clock , and pictures that had been scripted in a fortnight were filmed in another two weeks . From this industrious factory , and from others across London , came a never - ending flow of costume melodramas , musicals , detective stories and films in every other sort of genre . The quota legislation is generally depicted as a disastrous blow to the British film industry , dragging down its reputation and perpetuating the sort of mediocrity that previously characterized the output of Stoll and Ideal Studios .",0

"top of the English section That 's because Bolton won five nil if I remember . That 's right , Bolton won five nil but what we did get clarified from the Football League today was if two English teams finish their four games on the same number of points , is it goal difference or is it the number of goals scored that is the crucial factor ? And rather surprisingly , bearing in mind what happens in the Endsleigh first division , that there it is goals scored that dis differentiates between teams , in this league it will be goal difference that will determine the final positions , followed then by the highest number of goals and then by the highest number of goals scored away from home . So at the moment Notts County , although they scored four goals and Bolton scored five , so in the current English system they 'd just be one goal behind Bolton , their goal difference is only plus two , Bolton 's is plus five , so that is a significant factor .",1
"WITH THE SUDDEN ENDING of the War the aircraft industry was thrown into chaos , but there was a renewed interest in a £ 10,000 prize offered by the Daily Mail in 1913 to the first pilot to fly across the Atlantic . There was much activity at Brooklands as people strove to get ready for their attempts . Jack too , was interested in attempting the flight , perhaps he was more confident than anyone else , his long distance flying experience would certainly stand him in good stead . A condition of the Daily Mail prize was that no serving pilot could win it , and so on March 10 , 1919 Jack was demobbed , ending his service career with the rank of Captain , he was now free to pursue this latest flying challenge . He approached Vickers and convinced them of his worth as pilot for their Atlantic crossing attempt .",0

"Their immediate reaction to the Beveridge Report 's proposals was displayed graphically in a cartoon , the caption to which read ‘ Cheer up , Maggie , we shall get £ 2 a week when we are 97 — a bitter comment on the gradualist compromises of the new pension scheme . A Pensioners’ National Appeal had been taken up by the Daily Dispatch in 1938 and Ritchie Calder 's articles in the Daily Herald , ‘ Life on 10/ a Week’ , provided a further boost for the 1939 agitation with their Orwellian revelations . In keeping with the rank - and - file strength of the movement , however , pressure was applied most effectively at local level . By comparison with the ‘ insider’ methods of the Old People 's Welfare Committees , it was also profoundly political , resembling , as later commentators put it , ‘ the abrasive approach of 1960s pressure groups such as Shelter rather than the more staid ‘ non political’approach ' of the voluntary organizations . Given the qualified success of the 1939 escapade , The Pensioner remarked in April 1940 that ‘ To exert pressure on the Government as a whole is to invite failure as is demonstrated by the fate of many petitions.’",0
"Sometimes the relationship may be direct but the reference deleted . The fact that several of the boys were active members of the National Front , for example , had an all too direct bearing on how they positioned themselves as narrators of the fight , even though they were anxious to characterize their role as merely voicing public opinion on the estate . Equally , the unofficial communique was undoubtedly part of a rank - and - file protest against pressures for reform generated by the Scarman Report , even if no mention is made of it ! Often the relation is more oblique . The eliciting context of ' Fighting talk ' was one in which the boys may have been quite strongly motivated to impress the researcher by exaggerating the extremity of their views on race .",0

"Effective management of a county interest required the politician to do more than strike a bargain in which a vote , or votes , was the return for immediate patronage . When a politician assisted a freeholder with a gift of a patronage appointment , he would almost always give it in the guise of an act of friendship , and it was the friendly relationship which was the truly significant factor . The intent of the politician was of course to create a feeling of obligation , which he undoubtedly hoped would stand him in good stead at the next election , but such feelings were all the stronger because the shrewd political manager never breathed a word about a bargain or the anticipated political return . Acts of seemingly disinterested friendship , reinforced by regular social contacts , were in fact the only sound approach to building a powerful county interest . On the other hand , even if the politician demonstrated his ability to provide a great deal of patronage , if he did not follow it up with effective social contact , he would be laying a poor foundation for a political interest , and the gratitude of the freeholders under those circumstances could be short - lived .",0

"The study investigated children in care whose social workers wanted to find homes with substitute families for them , taking as two basic assumptions that every child has a right to a family of his [ or her]own , and that adoption and fostering are not completely separate categories but have a considerable area of overlap . It was found that 22 per cent of the whole group of children were thought to need a substitute family ; and permanent substitute families were being sought for nearly three - quarters of these . Forty per cent of the children needing placement were considered to need permanent foster homes , 6 per cent direct adoption and 26 per cent a foster home with a view to adoption . It was found that decisions about placements were often long delayed while efforts were made to solve the family 's problems . Yet rehabilitation was only expected for a minority about 25 per cent— of all the children in the study .",0

"The conceptual rationale for judicial intervention has already been examined . When the courts intervene to control the X factor they do so in purported fulfilment of the legislative will , by delineating the boundaries of one institution 's powers from that of another : a public body adjudicating on furnished tenancies can not trespass on the territory of a different body dealing with unfurnished tenancies . The rationale for judicial intervention on the Y level is more indirect . The authority is within its assigned area , it is for example properly adjudicating on furnished premises , and the question before us now concerns the rationale for judicial control over the fair rent which should be charged for such premises . The link with sovereignty and with the ultra vires doctrine is provided by implication : parliament only intended that such discretion should be exercised on relevant and not irrelevant considerations , or to achieve proper and not improper purposes .",1
"The works council , as the representative structure at the plant level , was formally union - independent and had no powers beyond the handling of grievances resulting from the interpretation of the industry agreement . In the post - war period , although the union confederations tried to limit organisation at plant level ( as being potentially destructive of class consciousness ) , the councils became increasingly significant . They were the only source of direct involvement for the rank and file as the channel through which they expressed their demands and discontent . Consequently , new union - based structures ( ' factory councils ' ) were developed as organisations of the shop stewards , to be directly representative of the rank and file . They are regarded by many employers ' associations ( although lacking official recognition ) as a means of encouraging greater stability in shopfloor relations .",0

"Following the great betrayal of 1882 , when Gladstone presided over the annexation of Egypt , they could not even rely on the Liberal party to resist the imperialist tide . Imperial expansion was driven forward not only by the collapse of order in extra - European societies , but also by intensifying competition from Britain 's European rivals for ' a place in the sun ' . British Governments staked their claim to disputed areas by formalizing imperial control . As British diplomats manoeuvred to protect extra - European spheres of influence against foreign rivals , they found themselves inexorably drawn into taking sides in the hardening alliance system on the European continent .

The minority of Labour members on the committee did not agree with this and issued their own minority report , but the most significant point about the conclusion is that the majority on the committee excluded at the outset the possibility of obtaining the evidence they would need to judge properly whether there was any abuse of power . They refused to examine particular complaints or cases , did not examine branch files and did not interview rank - and - file officers ; in other words , they did none of the things that would have had to be done to get at the truth . In Australia , Canada and the United States during the 1970s inquiries into the political police and internal - security agencies demonstrated clearly that reliance on interviews with chief constables and general assertions of good faith by all concerned would be inadequate . After 1986 parliamentary concern shifted towards the security service or MI5 , particularly because of allegations that it had been involved in attempts to smear elected politicians during the 1970s .",0
"The picture cut from the newsreader in the studio to the rain - lashed Yorkshire countryside and a reporter standing huddled against the driving rain .

' One man has apparently sustained a serious head injury after the belay on his rope failed and he fell fifty feet down a pitch to the rock floor .

"He died 10 years later , on 20 June 1828 , in nearby Wellington Street — just two days short of his twenty - ninth wedding anniversary , and a mere two weeks after the death of his pauper uncle , John Titford , in Frome . He was buried at that most busy of London churches , St Luke 's , Old Street , leaving a widow who would run a little milliner 's business in Soho before dying , 23 years later , in Westminster . An appropriate valedictory comment on W. C. T. might be that he underwent a dramatic rags - to - riches transformation , conveniently abandoning the Dissenting zeal of his ancestors in the process . It does look , after all , as if respectability posed the greatest of all threats to the survival of Nonconformity ; the son and grandson of Baptist believers as he was , cousin to a family of ardent devotees of the Worship Street Chapel , William Charles appears to have paid little more than passing lip - service to the cause . All the evidence seems to indicate that he had become a half - hearted Anglican — perhaps that was a safer way , after all , of establishing yourself as a respectable tradesman than anything which smacked in any way of revolt or radicalism ?",0

"If there was a strong majority in favour of a particular action , we would go to great lengths to persuade the minority of the error of their ways . Many other companies have a more autocratic culture in that the chairman and chief executive will have a disproportionate say in what happens . ‘ The other board members will expect to have their say , but at the end of the day they expect , and accept , that the chairman should decide.’ The next phase of Haslam 's career was one where he moved about from company to company rather than from function to function .

"Account also has to be taken of the distribution of investment between branches of industry and of the intensity and efficiency of capital use — though the latter is extremely difficult to measure . What is more , on an international comparative basis the level of investment in relation to the achieved rate of growth was not low in the UK — indeed , it was on average three times the German level over the late 1960s and early 1970s [ Cairncross et al.,1977 ; Williams , 1962 ] . Hence , explanations and prescriptions which stress higher investment as the direct means to higher growth in the UK are probably very wide of the mark [ Pollard , 1982 ] . The claim is sometimes made that the capacity of British industry to achieve higher absolute levels of investment has been weakened by declining rates of profit [ Flemming et al.,1976 ] . In addition , low profits might be assumed to have lowered expectations of future profits and hence weakened the incentive to invest — a factor shown by the Radcliffe Report ( 1959 ) to have been far more important in determining investment policy than the rate of interest .",0

"One does not wish to repeat oneself unduly and the reader is referred to other parts of this book which have relevance in this matter of sexual offences against children ( see Chapters 4 and 5 ) . Sexual offences by children can , of course , take place . Indeed , a good deal of children 's play , if otherwise defined , could be held to fall into this category ; and occasionally police or social workers are hard put to it to determine where the line should be drawn . Play and experiment of a more or less directly sexual nature is natural and normal among younger children and , provided it takes place in non - frightening circumstances between children of roughly the same age there is generally no harm in it at all . However , when such play becomes hurtful or frightening to one of the children involved it may have effect equal to that of interference by an adult and should be regarded accordingly .",1

"I do n't think that 's slow , I think that 's moving with very considerable speed . Here , here . Er indeed the directive was promulgated as the minister said but I do n't think it was a bolt out of the blue , it was of course something that we around for some considerable time before that and of course that excuse hardly applies to the delay in establishing the European parliamentary constituency committees , er as the minister er will know very well , it was merely a matter of seven weeks , er the excuse being that had they had another seven weeks they could have had the public inquiry stage , the reality of course was that there was plenty of time to do this in good time and in good order and without the confusion that exists now er around the candidatures and the boundaries of the existing European boundaries . On the question of registration of electors , clearly it is very important that if we now have less than nine weeks from this evening for those possibly four hundred thousand people to seek registration then the it is essential that the minister and the department er engage in a serious advertising campaign to ensure that people can exercise the rights that are due to them and I would like the minister perhaps in his later remarks , to expand on what , if any , measure the government intends to take to publicise the fact of E C voting rights to those four hundred thousand or so er European citizens of voting age resident in this country . Needless to say er Mr Deputy Speaker , other European countries are taking the job more seriously .",0
"Attempts to refloat the monarchy after the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII were made easier by the fact that the royal family included a king with a stammer and two princesses . By the 1990s the royal family spanned four generations , and the two princesses had acquired a husband each ( one marriage ended in divorce ) , six children , three children - in - law and half - a - dozen grandchildren . As the cast list expanded through royal marriages and the creation of a brood of ‘ nearly royals’— frivolous young men and women staking a claim to attention in the gossip columns simply because another member of the family had a genuine connection with the Windsors — the roles could be constantly juggled to satisfy an appetite which had been primed by the Palace itself . The change from mythic beings to human beings , while it demeaned individual younger members of the royal family ( ‘ How big is Fergie 's bottom?’ ) , did make their personal lives easier in one respect . In 1953 , Princess Margaret had been obliged to call off her relationship with the divorced Group Captain Peter Townsend on the advice of the prime minister and the Queen 's private secretary .",0

"If the family should choose the first method , for example , ensuring that a life - story book is provided , then the child has the option of an identity outside his or her adoptive family . If they choose to ignore the historical background of the child and feel that thus they will be better able to identify with him or her , then in times of crisis the child will have no solid racial and cultural identity and the family may not have the information to help the child in these crucial times . Some transracial adopters may prefer to isolate themselves from the cultural background and ethnic origin of their child because it is easier in the short run to escape conflicts . Then there are others who are satisfied with superficial information because they feel that if more is revealed then conflict could arise in the family . In cases where a child is born out of wedlock , these families may struggle with their conception of what a normal family should be and various moral issues .",0
"The United Nations states that ' food supplies might be adequate if they were evenly distributed in relation to needs ' . In fact one ( admittedly optimistic ) international study of agricultural potential estimated that the world could feed 25 times its present population .

However , per capita food production in Africa has been declining slowly and steadily over the last few decades .

"That would account for the eight per cent swing from Labour to the Conservatives , which boosted Alan Stewart 's majority in Eastwood to over 11,000 .

It must have something to do also with the close shave that Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Malcolm Bruce was given in Gordon , where his majority was trimmed by 9,000 .

The writers take risks and every episode has something wacky about it : elaborate dream sequences ; an argument played back four different ways from the perspective of each of the participants ; the cast transported into the world of the Dick van Dyke Show . Occasionally and inevitably they go over the top — but that 's in the nature of risk . Besides , the fantasy moments are balanced by and anchored in an amazingly acute eye for detail , for the nuances of real relationships : in this sense thirtysomething produces the quality of the best feature films , week in and week out .

TEST STARS FACE RAP WIGAN Test stars Martin Offiah and Kelvin Skerrett could face a League rap after missing the medal ceremony at yesterday 's Charity Shield against St Helens at Gateshead .

The maximum punishment is non - receipt of the medals and a disrepute charge.’,1
"Caterers now have every reason to ensure that staff are trained to the appropriate level and already there is pressure on the Awarding Bodies to provide a more realistic range of courses than at present . Perhaps it was too much to expect of the Government to spell out , as many had wanted , who should be trained , to what level and within what timescale . On reflection , the catering industry may well be much better off as a result of the Government 's proposals for a self - regulatory approach , but it all depends at the end of the day on how well it gets its act together , using Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment systems to identify the problem areas . The wider food industry now has to demonstrate that it is using all within its power to minimise the risk of injury to the health of the consumer . Whilst the law is designed to give succour in times of difficulty to those who do their best , it will show little mercy to those who are at the receiving end of proceedings who can not demonstrate that they have given the highest priority .",0
"Wage information from Yorkshire is similarly supportive of the Gilboy position , suggesting a 50 per cent increase in the money wages of craftsmen and labourers in the West Riding between 1750 and 1780 and in the North Riding an increase of 100 per cent for the former and 33 per cent for the latter . Taking the evidence from those areas where industrial employment was expanding , Professor Malcolmson has accepted that they "" unquestionably experienced a general increase in real wages "" during the last third of the eighteenth century , and qualify the generally unhappy standard of living experience over the rest of the country . The evidence for this regional divergence does not rest only on wage levels in manufacturing and mining . An important part of the argument is that the competitive effect of these expanding sectors in the district labour market was to raise the wages of agricultural labour . It began that division of agricultural England into a high - wage North and a low - wage South which is best known from Sir James Caird 's map drawn when the dichotomy was at its peak in 1850 .",1

"At this stage suffice it to say that the naive , unreconstructed quantity theory of money is normally introduced at this stage ‘ purely for the purposes of exposition’ . In logarithmic form the Cambridge equation becomes : To depict the aggregate supply function we first need to draw a distinction between aggregate supply in the short run , where expectations may be sluggish in reacting to external events , and the long run where money is neutral and where the supply of output is invariant with respect to the nominal money supply and the absolute price level . The long - run aggregate supply function , AS * ; , is therefore a vertical line in ( p , y ) space , touching the y axis at y * ; . On that much — the shape of the long - run supply function — Keynesians and new classicals can agree : the willingness of firms to produce commodities does not depend upon the absolute price level .",0

"The March 912 in which Hunt drove proved competitive and some reasonable results enabled the Hesketh team to stagger through the year . For Hesketh , now committed to racing and to Hunt 's career — with a generosity unparalleled in FI — it seemed as sensible to take Hunt straight up into FI , and Hunt duly made his debut at a non - championship race at Brands Hatch early in 1973 , there earning , in a used Surtees TS9B , a third place just behind Denny Hulme — and Hulme was , let it be noted , driving the McLaren M23 , a far more advanced car . The die was cast , then and there , and Hunt and Hesketh and company hit Monaco in style : yacht in the harbour , helicopter to hand and a March 731 to drive . To the general surprise , the March — it was worked on by Harvey Postlethwaite , now at Ferrari and one of a handful of the really bright ones — proved an effective foil for Hunt 's driving style : Hunt qualified ninth and was running sixth when his engine gave up the ghost . His first FI point came in France , a fourth place followed at Silverstone , a third at Zandvoort , a sixth in Canada and a fine second behind Ronnie Peterson at Watkins Glen .",0

"One interesting answer comes from a research group at Harvard ~ University organized by Andrei Shleifer , a distinguished economist who focuses on how governments make economic life harder than it need be . Shleifer ’s research looks at 75 countries and asks how many formal steps it takes to establish ( legally and without bribes ) a new company , how long it takes to do so , and what is the cost . For if a country makes it hard to create companies , do n’t be surprised if new companies are few and far between . And if companies are not created , where will growth and employment come from ? The table ( see at the bottom of the text ) gives a flavor of the odyssey involved in setting up a business : an average for 75 countries shows more than 10 separate steps of getting various certificates and a cumulative time of 63 days spent in getting the paperwork done ( assuming no bureaucratic delays ) and total payments to government as high as one third of a year ’s income .",0

"In other words , action which is predetermined by some external constraints can not be seen in the same light as action which accords with some convention , though , on occasion , constrained action may be glossed as rule - governed in an associated account , particularly where the agency of a person is in doubt . Certain actions of football fans , for example , are quite clearly directed by factors extrinsic to their group . One would not want to suggest that attending football games on Saturdays , as opposed to any other day , was rule - governed if matches are only ever played on Saturdays . Rules are arbitrary in character and are to do with the manner in which people choose between alternative modes of conduct . As we are using the notion rules are to be seen as having all - or - none character — if a rule governs a kind of action such action is always governed by rule .",1
"The party was in a mutinous condition in November 1911 and there was no apparent successor who would have even half of Balfour 's political gifts . Nor was it clear that Balfour 's departure was universally desired : at the National Union Conference a few days later , Leo Maxse was booed off the platform , and constituency parties everywhere passed resolutions regretting Balfour 's decision . A great many crocodile tears were shed , for , since Unionists had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership , they were unable to accept that they had just driven their own leader from office . The shock caused by Balfour 's going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affairs of the party with less friction than had been fashionable of late . The main contenders for the leadership were Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long , representing the two different establishments of the Edwardian Unionist party — the opposite worlds of Birmingham and Wiltshire — but the situation was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders , Edward Carson and Andrew Bonar Law .",0
"Coal is a cheaper and more easily used energy source than the alternatives . It is cheap because it is plentiful .

"‘ The confidential papers I have seen demonstrate that what were called various tax benefits were central to negotiations .

"But the fact that it is protected by unwritten convention rather than by a legal constitution means that there is no external brake upon Parliament or the courts moving to restrict it in particular ways , as the mood of the times takes them . Britain may still be a country where "" everything is permitted which is not specifically prohibited "" , but the specific prohibitions have become more numerous , without having to justify themselves against the overriding principle of public interest suggested by the Royal Commission on the Press . However , those who operate the law are well aware that it will only be respected to the extent that it conforms with public opinion : the reason why journalists and broadcasters are not prosecuted much more often for undoubted infringements of the letter of the laws of contempt and official secrecy is simply that the authorities are well aware that up - to - the - hilt enforcement of these vague laws would bring the law into further disrepute , and precipitate precisely the sort of clash between government and the press that it has been the British genius to avoid , whenever possible , by cosy arrangements . Moreover , the law is only one method of control over what is placed in the public arena .

"As insurance the selectors have picked seven loose forwards and this may emphasise one of the great worries about the touring side . An Australian tour only requires a 25 or 26-man squad from New Zealand , with replacements only three hours away . The uneven nature of the tour , with hard games on the weekend and soft ones mid - week , does not make too many physical demands on players . Yet Mains and his men want a squad of 30 . This will make it extremely hard for some players to get more than two or three of the 11 games in Australia — and that would not be long enough to evaluate the newcomers ' test qualifications .",1
"For some roles , younger people are deemed by some quarters as more suitable , just as in the theatre a certain role will require a certain age range to portray it . But much more importantly , the view was successfully expressed that you need experience , particularly in a recession . A 32 year old manager may be full of vigour , enthusiasm and malleable but a 52 year old manager has been through a couple of recessions , knows the ropes and cap pull a few more rabbits out of the hat . Similarly the admission in the Women in Management report that most employers view women as , generally speaking , more impressive than men , should be regulated in promotion and career opportunities .

"Modern gas blowlamps are cleaner and safer to use than the old - fashioned paraffin type and , for most jobs , the type which is fitted on to a disposable cartridge is perfectly adequate . An alternative is a blowtorch connected by a hose to a cylinder of gas . This is more expensive to buy , but the torch part is lighter to handle than a blowlamp and you do n't have to worry so much about running out of gas halfway through a job . Although you have to cart the cylinder around with you , there is a bonus in that a blowtorch can be used upside down to get under a pipe which is being fitted in situ ; turning a cartridge - fed blowlamp upside down can cause problems as it will flare . A blowlamp ( or blowtorch ) is also useful where a nut seems impossible to dislodge from its fitting , due usually to dried - up jointing compound .",1

"Quite apart from the fears this aroused on the left , the price of CEDA support was a return , especially in rural Spain , to the social situation of the monarchy — a course that could only have explosive consequences . THE RESPONSE OF THE LEFT The rank and file of both the Socialist movement and the CNT had been frustrated enough at the limitations of social reform under the Republic ; when the Radicals and the right set about negating what little seemed to have been gained , militancy rose to new levels . The almost unanimous electoral abstention of CNT members in November 1933 , in protest at the shortcomings of Republican reformism and the repressiveness of the Azaña governments towards the CNT itself , contributed significantly to the left 's defeat . In December there followed the most extensive anarchist rising of the entire Republican period .",0

"While in the world as a whole the dispossessed may outnumber the reasonably well - off by some four to one , in the democratic ‘ market economies’ of the capitalist world their minority status assures them lasting subservience to the democratic majority .

They weep crocodile tears for the poor and disadvantaged , but are basically happy with things as they are . In common with the financial markets in which they invest their funds , they are essentially short - term in their outlook , and would rather invest in secure compounds for the rich than extra public spending on the improvement of housing , education and job prospects in the urban ghettos that occasionally trouble them .

"He was one of the central figures in the Catholic Committee , a self - appointed body formed in 1778 , predominately lay in character and noble in membership , which saw itself as speaking for ‘ informed’ Catholic opinion ( Petre always protected radicals among the clergy , such as Alexander Geddes , q.v . ) and which agitated for the freeing of the English Catholics from civil disabilities . It had considerable influence in negotiating the Catholic Relief Acts of 1778 and 1791 and in preparing a new oath of allegiance . The visit of George III to Thorndon in October 1778 gave a royal seal of approval to Petre 's efforts . Not all his co - religionists were so enthusiastic .

"Few prior to Jones had cared to admit this seditious point except in the columns of the Police Review , where disgruntled beat officers ( often anonymously ) indicate the paradox of being the revered and reviled base on which all the hierarchy is built . Jones 's book remained untouched on the shelves of Northumbria 's modest library in its first two years , even though it had good reviews ; and the influence of his research has been all but negligible . For even though some attempt to give status to the ‘ community or home beat officer’ has been made following Lord Scarman 's ( 1981 ) report on the Brixton riots which gave something of a ‘ slap on the wrist’to the service , the deference accorded to specialist posting or to detective work remains untouched . In effect Jones 's book revealed an unwelcome truth which no one really wanted to hear and which the service was able easily to diffuse and ignore . Indeed when I was at the police college in 1987 and Jones was on the Senior Command Course prior to taking up a position as assistant chief constable , I took a straw poll among my immediate colleagues to see what influence such books achieve .",0

Lately he has been working on paintings of trees , large - sized drawings of nudes , painted low - reliefs in wood and a series of portraits of poets in which snippets from their work are inscribed ( Beats Alan Ginsberg and Gregory Corso appear in the show ) . An illustrated catalogue is available for the exhibition , which lasts until 31 December .",0
"The corollary of not being able to force people to think clean is that you can not force them to think dirty either . In 1959 , fifty - one years after he intended it should be published , D. H. Lawrence 's notorious novel Lady Chatterley 's Lover made its unexpurgated appearance in the United States . The magazine Field and Stream published this delightfully tongue - in - cheek review which says all that needs to be said about innocence and incorruptibility : Although written many years ago , Lady Chatterley 's Lover has just been reissued by the Grove Press , and this pictorial account of the day by day life of an English game - keeper is full of considerable interest to outdoor - minded readers as it contains many passages on pheasant raising , the apprehending of poachers , ways to control vermin and other chores and duties of the professional game - keeper . Unfortunately one is obliged to wade through many pages of extraneous material in order to discover and savour these sidelights on the management of a Midland shooting estate , and in this reviewer 's opinion the book can not take the place of J. Miller 's Practical Gamekeeping .",0

"Others had to look after him : friends sometimes ; a Spanish couple he employed at others . He expressed his thanks obliquely , like saying ‘ Some magic fairy came in my room while I was asleep , and put a pile of clean shirts on the dresser’ . He was liable to forget to buy birthday or Christmas presents ( one year when he resolved to mark Christmas properly , he bought everyone gift vouchers because he could not decide what to get ) , but would make a gift out of the blue for no other reason than that it was a nice day . He wanted to share his joy — or his misery . Books were what he bought most assiduously .",0

"Shiona would n't hear of it . ' Do n't worry , I 'll be perfectly OK on my own . ' Famous last words , she thought to herself , as she stepped out of the lift on to the second - floor landing of the luxury block of flats where she lived . Though the landing was empty and there was n't a sound all around , she had the strangest sensation that someone was there . The entrance to her own flat was down one of the narrow corridors that led off from the rectangular landing , and as she stepped towards it she noticed with sudden uneasiness that one of the wall lights halfway down the corridor had gone , plunging the passageway into semi - darkness .",0
"You are pretty as a picture and we would not want you drawing attention to yourself , would we!’ Joan meekly obeyed . What Alianor had failed to realize was that , under the sombre cloak , she was wearing a new and quite beautiful pale - pink gown trimmed with dark fur — a gown such as few maidservants would set eyes on in a lifetime , much less wear . Her waist defined by a gold chain girdle , she was wearing Edward 's ring on a gold chain around her neck . Outwardly , as Alianor saw her , she gave the appearance of a servant — but inwardly , to Joan herself , she was a damsel going to meet her lover .",0
"The plight of the injured was an unenviable one ; several of them could not be moved . They had to lie on their stretchers in the back of a lorry listening to the din of battle all around them . Finally , as dusk fell , the aircraft departed and Stirling had to take stock of the situation . He had lost twenty - five trucks and their valuable contents , plus twenty - odd jeeps . Four men had been killed .",0
"And she had answered , ‘ The sooner the better . I would have thought you were already known there , anyway.’ On New Year 's Eve , and out of the blue , he told her he was going to a party and he did n't know what time he would be back .

"' Curse this arm , ' he said , ' I ca n't hold you properly or make love to you . It hurts too much .

And his effortless success compared very piquantly with Lucky Jim 's struggles to rouse the opposite sex to carnal delights in the same year of 1954 . Kingsley Amis , who wrote an adventure for Bond as well as creating Jim Dixon , reflects aptly on the reasons for his : ' What happened was that we came in at the tail end of the literary tradition to the effect that no decent girl enjoys sex — only tarts were supposed to do that .",0

"The result is that the piece seems to become more polyphonic as the listener can more easily hear the lines . Nikolayeva adopts an orchestral approach in some pieces,(eg . the C sharp minor Fugue [ Book Two ] , where the intensity and unyielding rhythm make a strong impression ) , but her tonal range also suggests the organ ( E flat minor Prelude , Book One ) , a choir ( B flat minor Prelude , Book One ) , a trumpet ( D major Prelude , Book Two ) , and a violin ( B flat minor Prelude , Book One ) . The characterisation of the Fugues is incredibly varied — Nikolayev runs the whole gamut from the leisurely , almost lazy polyphony of the D major Fugue ( Book Two ) through the scherzando humour of the E flat and B flat Fugues in Book One , the simplicity of the C major Fugue ( Book One ) , the sheer beauty of tone of the F sharp minor fugue , Book Two , the granite - like strength of purpose and sound in the B flat minor Fugue , ( Book Two ) . Perhaps most impressively of all , the visionary glow of the C sharp minor Fugue in Book One makes for a transcendental and deeply telling interpretation that silences all criticism . One must simply accept these performances at face value and forget about problems of piano versus harpsichord versus clavichord .",0

"Given the immense volume of portfolio funds available , and relative mobility between countries , the day to day movements of exchange rates are primarily a capital account phenomenon , and consequently ( ii ) while purchasing power parity may hold in the long run if real shocks are unimportant , in the short run the exchange rate is not caused by PPP considerations ; rather , with the exchange rate clearing the asset markets , variations in international competitiveness lead to equilibrating changes in the size of the traded goods sector . For example , manufacturing industry in the UK was severely hit by the real appreciation of sterling up to mid 1980 . The project will therefore investigate more closely the following propositions :",0

"In many countries , fears have even arisen of a prolonged period of slow and occasionally negative growth , persistent obstacles to reducing unemployment , and continued economic anxiety ; or worse , of a Japanese - style “ lost decade ” with multiple recessions ; or , even worse , of a depression , ( which politicians and intellectuals have stoked in an attempt to justify continued massive government intervention in the economy for years to come ) . But are multiple downturns so unusual in periods of severe economic distress ? It would be useful to know the answer to this question before trying repeatedly to pump up the economy in the short run with costly policies that might worsen longer - run prospects . The global recession was severe , unmatched since World ~ War ~ II , with the possible exception of the early 1980s ( when , for example , the unemployment rate in America soared to 10.8 % as a by - product of the disinflation from the double - digit price growth of the late 1970s ) . From the beginning of the crisis in December 2007 to the apparent end of the recession in the summer of 2009 , the decline in real GDP in the US was 3.8 % .",0

"It should be noted that these arrangements have important consequences for the distribution of power in congress . Seniority provides committee chairmen with an independent power base and helps to insulate them from control by party leaders and presidents . Even if a president and his staff are successful in obtaining the cooperation of party and committee leaders , there are no guarantees that they will be able to deliver the votes of rank - and - file members . This has become especially the case in the ‘ new’ congress of the 1980s , where congressmen and senators have become even more individualistic and less amenable to control than before . Since the 1950s and 1960s there has been a weakening of the norms of ‘ good’ congressional behaviour which , by obliging most members to conform , had in the past helped to bring some order into the legislature .",0

"For the 24 students on a new Performing Arts Course at the Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology , it was a first day they would never forget . They were expecting the finer points of drama and theatre management … instead they were introduced to the skills of the big top . And rather than treading the boards … they were teetering two feet above them . Coping with stilts was one of the more popular activities … although getting the hang of it was n't easy : Mind you , mastering the stilts was nothing compared to the challenge of remaining astride a unicycle :",0
"Specifically , it is evident that the main differences between the communities with respect to the process of raising may be located in the T and DS environments . An insight of quite a different kind emerges from a comparison of table 6.8c with table 6.8a and b. It is evident that the basic rule constraining variation in realization of ( o ) is much closer to being categorical in the strongly vernacular , low - status Clonard area than in the outer - city areas ; a static representation like rule 1 is apparently not too wide of the mark as a guide to phonological patterns in the Clonard . This supports Labov 's claim that vernacular speech is more consistent and regular than corrected speech ( see 3.4 ) ; but however reasonable the claim , the original methods were not designed to show up such patterns in the data ( cf . 6.2.1 ) . The contrasting patterns shown in table 6.8 may be interpreted in conjunction with the tendency reported in 6.2.4 for phonological units in low - status speech to cover a wider phonetic range .",0
Helped by some workmen she tried again and this time reached the Wouldham side . She groped her way across and landed the doctor on the mud and he slithered on hands and knees up to the bank .

"Nearly all our crew were to tell us harrowing anecdotes of personal encounters with hungry pythons — some of which had been measured at over twenty - eight feet long . They all wore serpent - like black coral bracelets as special protective amulets against snakes . Laba , who was later to become one of our shipmates , had been a fruit farmer and had only recently taken up sailing on the advice of the local shaman after a string of close calls with pythons . Laba was quite a celebrity in the village , and from him we learnt just what it is like to be embraced by a really big snake . His fruit plantation had been a good four - hour walk from the village , and he was used to visiting it alone .",0
"The twelfth abbot , according to the guidebook , was the subject of complaints to the Pope , that he had treated his flock , ‘ not like a gentle shepherd , but like a ravening wolf , harrying it ‘ with the stings of affliction , and the bites of persecution’ , bestowing its property upon his kinsfolk and driving from the monastery those who dared to oppose him ' . How it rained in Arbroath ; trying to see through curtains of falling water makes a nonsense of note - taking . Yet , Boswell must have written on the hoof , and in fat detail — a diligence requiring either unstoppable ambition , and an almost morbid discipline — or both . The Life of Johnson makes plain how Boswell had been staking out the ground since their early acquaintance , making notes immediately after each meeting of what he himself was eventually to ‘ consider the peculiar value’ of the Life , ‘ that is , the quantity it contains of Johnson 's conversation’ . In September 1764 , eighteen months after they first met , Boswell told Johnson in a letter from Saxony , ‘ It shall be my study to do what I can to render your life happy ; and , if you die before me , I shall endeavour to do honour to your memory.’",0

"Even leading a relatively simple life on Tour would have cost around £ 12,000 in expenses alone if a professional had played in all 21 events last season . Often you can fork out several hundred pounds getting to an event abroad only to miss the cut and earn nothing . The answer to financial worries is to get a sponsor , but they are very few and far between as a glance down the players ' attachments will show you . Flanagan said : ‘ We try wherever possible to put girls in touch with potential sponsors . We often get enquiries from companies which may not have resources to sponsor a tournament , but are anxious to become involved with women 's golf , so we suggest a player sponsorship .",0

The mere fact that Penry Vaughan wished to go on seeing her , however few and far between their meetings , did wonders for her self - esteem . It also compensated very thoroughly for the disaster of her relationship with Guy , who received short shrift when he telephoned on his return to London from Wales .

"This is not the first or last case of over - statement .

"Indeed , you need to be something of a jack of all trades and passably good at most of them . The margins for error on a smallholding are extremely narrow ; only a skilled and diligent husbandman can hope to succeed . It is therefore prudent for a newcomer to spend considerable time and effort acquiring the skills before taking the plunge by buying a farm . Before you can begin to achieve overall competence you must master the ‘ language’ to a point where you can think , and even dream in a new vernacular . The vernacular of any way of life can only be absorbed ‘ through the skin’ by immersing oneself in its people ; and to this end you would be foolish not to spend at least a year ( preferably two ) working on mixed farms in the district in which you hope to settle , making friends and winning the respect of the countrymen who will be your neighbours .",0

"And , after his return to England at the beginning of the year , he was forced to catch up with all the work he had neglected .

In January also he had to speak at Pusey House in Oxford on "" The Lambeth Conference and Education "" , but one student 's disappointment at his performance on this occasion suggests the strain and lack of preparedness which were forced on him during this period : "" In questions Mr Eliot was most feeble and hesitant , humming and hawing much and throwing back the questions with "" Is that not what I said ?

It is far more important to be moving forward in broadly the right directions than to be stuck still without the businesses going anywhere .

While one can not assert unequivocally that determination will win , in the balance of life you can alter direction more easily on the move than you can if you are static , and if you have set the direction in this way it will almost alter itself .

" The Three Trillion Dollar War NEW ~ YORK – With March 20 marking the fifth anniversary of the United ~ States - led invasion of Iraq , it ’s time to take stock of what has happened . In our new book The Three Trillion Dollar ~ War , Harvard ’s Linda Bilmes and I conservatively estimate the economic cost of the war to the US to be $ 3~trillion , and the costs to the rest of the world to be another $ 3~trillion – far higher than the Bush administration ’s estimates before the war . The Bush team not only misled the world about the war ’s possible costs , but has also sought to obscure the costs as the war has gone on .",0
"Alongside this , the US Supreme Court has expanded citizens ' rights to sue police departments or their chief for officer misconduct . The individual officer is rarely held personally liable for his or her actions : damages are paid by the city , while legal costs are met by the union . However , such procedures are expensive , encouraging police departments to exercise more discipline over rank - and - file officers ( Sherman , 1983:227 ) . These political and legal developments have encouraged a pronounced shift of emphasis : from a law enforcement conception of policing , which ' views enforcement of the law as an end in itself , regardless of its consequences for the social order ' to a peace - keeping conception which ' views law enforcement as a means towards an end : the highest possible level of public safety , order and preservation of life and property'(Sherman , 1983:230 ) . Sherman believes that , as a result of these changes , police are more likely to talk their way out of a potentially disorderly situation than they were in the 1960s ( ibid.:231 ) .",0
"The chief superintendent for the area was a firm believer in community policing , and he put as his first priority the prevention of public disorder . However , it is clear that many of his police constables and sergeants did not agree with this approach . During the summer of 1985 there was evidence of increasing tension , and a prominent member of the Hornsey Police Federation was quoted as saying that rank and file officers ‘ desperately wanted to go in hard and sort out the criminals’ . Some serious incidents occurred during this period on the Broadwater Farm Estate , such as an attack on police by youths which resulted in one officer sustaining a bad head wound , and there was also a series of attacks on an Asian - owned supermarket . Senior police - officers appeared to play these incidents down , but black youths complained that on the estate they were increasingly harassed by the police .",0

Notably absent from his remarks were any clear or explicit indications of the terms on which he would agree to return or any clear or explicit criticism of the insurrection in Algiers . Reading between the lines , it was evident that de Gaulle was seeking to encourage those individuals in the political establishment — such as President Coty and the deputy prime minister , Guy Mollet — who were already moving towards a Gaullist solution , but that he was not yet willing to negotiate with the collective leadership of the Republic . He still needed to encourage supporters in the army and in the civilian population to keep up their pressure on the regime . This attitude was bitterly criticized by republican politicians who felt that he had given an enormous fillip to a rebellion that would otherwise have run out of steam .",0

Serious wildlife photographers go for super long lenses ( 250mm–600 mm ) which are relatively heavy and need to be supported by a sturdy tripod .

"At any rate it should not surprise us that when Virgil most startlingly irrupts into Pound 's Cantos ( rather late — it is in Canto 78 ) , he should be heard speaking in the Caledonian accents of Gavin Douglas . The question can still be raised whether Pound had any access to Virgil except through translation . Pound , following a polemical strategy which served him well in the short run ( but which later back - fired ) deliberately provoked the academic classicists of his day ; and his use of his sources , classical and other , was always both hasty and high - handed . And so there are still to be found Latinists who think that the hilarious mistranslations in his Homage to Sextus Propertius ( 1919 ) were inadvertent rather than mischievously deliberate . Accordingly the point must be made that the young Pound , as a doctoral student grounded quite rigorously in the Romance languages , certainly could and did read Virgil in the Latin .",0

"What is remarkable is that the initiative here was taken by the High Anglican clergy , who should have been the natural allies of the Stuart monarchy , and who had staunchly defended James 's title to the throne during the Exclusion Crisis . In contrast , most Whigs and Nonconformists ( who had remained in England ) either kept quiet or actively collaborated with James . Indeed , Anglicans were forced to engage in a propaganda campaign to try to prevent the Whigs and Nonconformists from falling too much in line with government policy . The case of the seven bishops was an important turning point in the development of events leading up to the Revolution , marking the defeat of James 's attempts to win Nonconformist support for his policies of toleration . Anglican polemicists had promised that they would allow the Dissenters some degree of toleration , if they helped them protect the Church of England from the Catholic onslaught , whilst the bishops in their petition affirmed that they did not act "" from any want of due tenderness to Dissenters , in relation to whom they are willing to come to such a temper as shall be thought fit , when the matter shall be considered and settled in Parliament and Convention "" .",0

This is not a merely tongue - in - cheek reaction to such arguments as that of Meillassoux .

"If the money stock ( M ) is only £ 500 , then the average number of times each pound changes hands , the velocity of circulation ( V ) must be 10 . As an identity , the quantity theory is no more than a way of calculating the velocity of circulation . The identity , however , is converted into a theory of the determination of the price level by assuming:(a ) that the money supply is determined by the monetary authorities;(b ) that the number of transactions is fixed in the short - run because of the classical presumption that the economy operates automatically at full employment ; and ( c ) that the velocity of circulation is also fixed in the short - run because it depends largely on institutional factors ( such as whether workers are paid weekly or monthly ) which themselves tend to remain constant for long periods of time . With T and V constant , the identity can be rewritten as follows : It now follows that changes in M , initiated by the monetary authorities , will cause proportionate changes in P. Notice that the direction of causation runs from changes in the stock of money to changes in the general price level . Definition : The quantity theory of money states that the average price of transactions in an economy is proportional to the nominal quantity of money in circulation .",0

The mujaheddin attack was further weakened by internal rivalries . Najibullah , who belonged to the local Ahmedzai tribe , flew to Gardez on Oct. 7 to bolster morale .",0

"TORY back - benchers last night shied away from a rebellion over the Budget imposition of value - added tax on domestic fuel . The threatened revolt fizzled out as Conservative critics decided to draw back from voting down the whole Budget , keeping their powder dry for future votes when the issue comes before the Commons in detail . Comfortable Government majorities on two key motions followed a searing fightback by the Chancellor , Norman Lamont , during raucous exchanges which saw him at one stage on the ropes in the face of a furious tirade by , alternately , the Labour leader , John Smith , and the shadow chancellor , Gordon Brown . Mr Lamont resisted persistent demands from Labour for assurances that pensioners not covered by income support would be fully compensated for the 17.5 per cent increase from April 1995 . He brushed aside charges that the Government had reneged on its election promises last year by comparing the Government borrowing crisis with the early years of the Thatcher Government in which , he said , taxes had to rise before they could be brought down after borrowing was stabilised .",0

Quite apart from the deafening thunder of the falls , and the awe - inspiring sight of their dramatic descent , the effect can be sheer magic on a fine day ; as the sunlight catches the spray in flight , and transforms it into an elusive pattern of shapes and colours that suggest in painting the Impressionism of Manet or the mists of Corot , or in music , the evocative nuances of Debussy .

"The primary purpose of Chamberlain 's Tariff Reform programme was imperial consolidation .

It was J. A. Hobson who made the most influential and original attempt to come to grips with the nature of the new imperialism . Born into a provincial Liberal family in 1858 , Hobson developed unorthodox views which prevented him from securing an academic career in his chosen field of economics .",0

Talking to Unigram at Olivetti 's week - long promotional fair in Rome last week , Lucino Pinto , research and development director , said the Italian group ‘ will sign an agreement with DEC for Alpha,’ though full details of the deal have not yet been worked out , and no time scales were offered . Pinto confirmed that a prototype Alpha box would be around by the end of the year ( UX No 376)— other officials said the emergence of shrink - wrapped non - proprietary Unix environments — with the added incentive of Unix System Laboratories Inc 's Destiny and Microsoft Corp NT already scheduled for Alpha — will open up the workstation market sufficiently for it to stake a claim . Indeed , Pinto said Olivetti is working closely with Microsoft on a client - only version of NT . It sees no problem with adding the Alpha architecture to the MIPS Computer Systems Inc and Intel Corp - based systems it currently offers , a trail that DEC is already blazing in any case , but it has to figure out whether and how it will be able to address the window of opportunity it reckons the industry is now creating with the latest round of hardware and software announcements , and of course , how deep it would have to dig into its back pocket .",0

"The Communist Party Central Committee complained in February 1932 : The Minority Movement is a small self - absorbed organization of leaders who have nothing to do with the real struggle of the workers and who instead of going to the workers , working among them and fighting against the reformist leaders in the Trade Unions , simply approach the workers with the invitation to take part in a highly elaborate organisational structure . The Battersea Congress of the Party , to which this complaint was later addressed , gave official backing to a scheme which had been projected for some time , a Revolutionary Trade Union Opposition to unite the various unofficial movements which had been growing up in many important unions . While this did not expressly exclude the Minority Movement , the growth of Communist - led "" rank and file movements "" did in effect bring an end to the MM and to all formal Party subsidiaries within the unions . Communist fractions , of course , remained in being but they did not breach the basic principle of British trade unionism that there should be no separate organizations based on ideology or religion and standing in opposition to the TUC . At the Seventh Congress of the Comintern in 1935 the trade union policy pursued since 1928 was tacitly admitted to have been a blunder .",0
"The price - stability mandate has been trumped by concerns about growth . The fear is that tightening monetary policy to bear down on inflation could snuff out the faltering economic recovery .

"When the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League was formed by Ho in 1925 its nucleus consisted of Vietnamese terrorists , the Tam Tam Xa , who had already attempted the assassination of a French Governor - General on a state visit to Canton , and Canton became a staging - post for the return of young Vietnamese revolutionaries who might now declare themselves to be Marxists as well . What Ho himself understood by Marxism at this stage can perhaps best be seen in the first Vietnamese Marxist revolutionary text : The Road to Revolution , published in 1926 . While the idea of the two - stage revolution : liberation first , communism later : could be described as primitive Leninism , it may be seen that Ho 's approach to Communism was also two - track : town and country : not necessarily in that order : and his Revolutionary Youth League also functioned on two levels : the mass nationalist party and the inner core of Tam Tam Xa hotheads who were to be the nucleus of a future communist party . In its promotion of conjoint nationalism and communism the League resembled the Kuomintang at this time : and it lasted only as long as the Kuomintang managed to contain the two movements . In addition to their ideological training , many Vietnamese also attended the Whampoa Military Academy in Canton where they were instructed by , among others , Chiang Kai Shek .",1

"How can a God , in whom there is no evil , love sinful creatures like ourselves ? The problem of evil has exercised people in all three traditions of historical monotheism and nobody has ever been able to find a logical way of reconciling it with the concept of the one God . Julian 's solution does not make rational sense , but it does reverberate emotionally with an important dimension of the Christian religion of love , which sometimes gets lost in the more cerebral doctrinal formulations of the faith . The problem of sin would be a key theme in the sixteenth century reformations . This was an age of high anxiety in the West , when people felt deeply disturbed by the vision of God 's purity and their own failings .",1

"Poll books recording the electoral choices of individual voters are common survivals from the years before the Secret Ballot Act of 1872 , but are more numerous for borough than for county constituencies , and have all too frequently been studied in isolation from other types of evidence . This project aims to achieve a clearer understanding of all the contextual factors influencing decisions made by voters in a representative English country during the so - called ‘ first age of paraty,’ thereby making a significant contribution to knowledge in the fields of historical psephology and eighteenth - century political history . In particular , the mechanisms of landlord - influence in rural and urban communities will be looked at in some detail with a view to explaining the variable incidence of the ‘ deferential’ and ‘ participatory’types of voting identified by previous research . This study will reach beyond the poll books themselves to consider tax assessments , rentals , manorial records and other documentary sources able to supply information about named individuals . Data relating to a carefully constructed sample of voters from selected townships within the count will be linked together and subjected to intensive computer analysis using software tools especially developed by the research team .",0

"It is in holy love that we glimpse the meaning of the cross because ‘ God so loved the world that he gave his only Son’(John 3.16 ) . God 's love is outgoing , outpouring love . It is a love which redeems sinful people , not by saying : ‘ We 'll let bygones be bygones’ , but by saying : ‘ I 'll bear that load for you ; you wo n't need it again.’ It seems impossible , then , to avoid the New Testament message that Jesus ' death was planned by God to be the means of reconciliation and peace .

"These words from Flower of Scotland will no doubt have been running through the head of Dick Best as he flew home to London yesterday . The England coach , who is also assistant to Ian McGeechan on the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer , and who has been in Scotland since last Thursday , admitted yesterday that the Scots ' performance against Wales ‘ had been very impressive and must have surprised quite a few people , especially down south’ . Best who was at a Lions selection meeting in Edinburgh yesterday morning , reckoned the margin and manner of Scotland 's 20 - 0 victory would certainly have England worried and that he expected a cracker of a game on Saturday week at Twickenham , where Scotland have won only twice , in 1971 and 1983 , since the Second World War . ‘ Bearing in mind that it will be Ian McGeechan 's last game as Scotland coach , it 's a perfect setting for Gavin and his side to give him a fitting send - off,’ said Best , who will be taking a video of the Murrayfield game back with him and will spend this week poring over it , looking at both the performances of Scotland and potential Lions . What most impressed Best about Scotland 's showing was their lineout play .",1
"Thus opponents of the ordination of women might plausibly say ( as Barth would seem to ) that fundamental to the scripture is male headship . A conservative could adduce , in support of this contention , the fact that in scripture God is overwhelmingly conceptualized by using male metaphors ; that God came in Christ , a male human person ; and that he chose men alone to head the church ( if one thinks that the calling of the twelve bears a relation to the constitution of the church ) . At the end of the day it is a case of choosing what one 's faith will be about — a point which Christians are reluctant to acknowledge . Once one has conceded that , then one has entered the arena of an ' a priori ethical ' position . Among Christian feminist theologians who may be said to have employed in part a ' golden thread ' approach , although not specifically in relation to the question of ordaining women , is Rosemary Ruether .",0

"They have also been responsible for many symposia and meetings for specialists in the field of venereology . In spite of these efforts , the incidence of the sexually transmitted diseases continues to increase . The trouble is that when two people hop into bed together , whether it is after a disco in the West End of London , in an igloo in Greenland , or in a hut in Africa , the last thing on their minds is the opinion of a collection of ‘ VD’ experts from the WHO in Geneva . While it is unquestionably a step in the right direction for such international teams to make recommendations as to optimal treatment schedules and ideal diagnostic facilities , it avails little if governments do not take their advice or if there is a shortage of money , personnel , or both . This appears , sadly , to be the situation in many countries , and suggestions like the one from the WHO document Social and health aspects of sexually transmitted disease ( 1977 ) that ‘ it is essential for clinics to have the basic equipment required for making rapid diagnosis : the darkfield examination , a quick micro - flocculation test for syphilis , and smear and culture of specimens for gonorrhoea’ are not much use to a health worker in a village in India , who , far from considering buying a microscope , can not obtain the antibiotics needed to cure gonorrhoea had he the facilities for diagnosing it .",0

"Just as men 's muscularity was and is celebrated in the histories , so was another man fascinated by the muscularity of women who worked at the pitheads . A Victorian gentleman called A.J.

In Wigan the women wore trousers , they had the strength of horses , and Munby loved that .

"At first sight , this approach has the advantage that the classification issue does not depend solely on a value judgment by the court about the appropriate scope of governmental activity . But the approach is not adequate by itself : on the one hand , not all of the functions which government consciously decides to perform are public ; and on the other hand , there may well be functions performed by non - governmental bodies which have not attracted government attention , encouragement or participation but which nevertheless are of public importance . So at the end of the day it must be for the courts to decide how to classify particular functions , and this can only be done on the basis of some normative judgment about the desirable scope of judicial review . A good illustration of this point is provided by a case in which the London Borough of Greenwich sought to challenge by judicial review the distribution by the Government of a leaflet explaining the poll tax : the Borough argued that the leaflet was inaccurate and , therefore , that its distribution was illegal . The court decided that the leaflet was not sufficiently misleading to justify finding in the Borough 's favour ; but implicit in the court 's decision is a further decision that the court had jurisdiction to decide the issue of legality — in other words , that the decision to distribute the leaflet was amenable to judicial review .",0

"There is no individual specification which appears to embrace the whole of the mechanical conditions to be dealt with ; but there are many good points contained in the specification of Messrs. Glover and Messrs. Gwynne ; and it would appear that a combination of certain parts of these two schemes would produce a highly satisfactory machine . For instance the hauling drums proposed by Messrs. Glover are without doubt the best system , and these can be applied to the original idea which has been adopted by Messrs. Gwynne viz : — 1 Free Balance Rope and 2 Hauling Ropes to each tank . Then Messrs. Gwynne 's proposal for equalizing the strain on each inidividual rope by means of connected Hydraulic Rams is most satisfactory , as also is their suggestion for actuating the lift up gates by means of Hydraulic pressure utilising the engine for pumping up the accumulator . The three firms appear to be consonant with regard to the small steam power required to actuate the lift : viz : about 25 h.p . Likewise they unanimously advocate the adoption of the tail rope to insure uniformity of motion .",1
"Through the centuries politicians , protestors and agitators of every sort found them invaluable for smiting the public eye ; and , in their most debased form , they were used by such printers as James Catnach ( 1792–1841 ) of the Seven Dials , London , to convey to sensation seekers scaffold speeches by murderers and other criminals , often before the rogues had uttered a word or given any sign that they intended to . A group of provincial ' battledores ' from Gainsborough , Kettering , Castle Cary , etc .

"But much research , including a recent study by the IMF , suggests that raising taxes and reducing government spending has a negative short - term effect on aggregate demand , thereby reinforcing deflationary and recessionary trends – and undermining fiscal consolidation . In an ideal world , where policymakers could credibly commit to medium- to long - term fiscal adjustment , the optimal and desirable path would be to commit today to a schedule of spending reductions and tax increases , phased in gradually over the next decade as the economy recovers . That way , if the economy needed another targeted fiscal stimulus in the short run , financial markets would not respond by driving up borrowing costs . Unfortunately , the fiscal policy currently adopted by various advanced economies deviates sharply from this path of credible medium - term consolidation combined with short - term additional stimulus . In the US , we have the worst of all possible worlds .",0

Interviews , word - lists and reading passages were recorded with twenty speakers of both sexes and various ages from communities associated with both major ethnic groups in the city . The investigators had already developed some quite strong linguistic hunches , and while these often turned out to be fairly accurate , pilot work sometimes revealed that they were a little wide of the mark . It also helped in identifying important variables which had not previously been thought to be particularly interesting . A number of hazards were revealed which had not been specifically predicted but which needed to be taken into account in designing the main research project .",0

"These can , following Porter , be put together as shown in figure 4.5 . This makes much better sense than the General Electric list , because it places projected profitability as the major element of industrial attractiveness , rather than simply listing it as one of several factors , and provides a sound theoretical basis for determining it . Following the implications of the McKinsey matrix , Porter states that there is usually little that the firm can do in the short run to affect industry structure and hence attractiveness . It should focus upon understanding that structure in order to develop a competitive strategy . Porter points out , nevertheless , that industry structures do change over time , perhaps due to technological or other developments , and that the firm itself may , through its competitive strategy , change the structure either inadvertently or not .",0

"Revisionist research has credited the revolutionary intelligentsia with a somewhat more modest role than does each of the three traditional schools of thought . The focus of this research has reflected growing awareness that preoccupation with a handful of leading figures may create a distorted picture ; that Chernyshevsky , Plekhanov and Lenin may not be typical in terms of social background , personality or motivation ; that both their own ideological development and that of the rank and file must be more firmly located in its social context ; that the schemes and blueprints drawn up by leaders — and the criticisms hurled by their rivals — may be a poor guide to how the revolutionary parties actually functioned . More attention , therefore , has been paid to the process by which rank - and - file intelligenty were recruited into the underground ; the interaction between their ideological development and the popular pressure for change welling up from below ; the social composition and structure of the revolutionary organizations they created ; and the impact which those organizations had upon the masses they sought to represent . The effect has been to highlight weaknesses in each of the traditional interpretations and to demythologize the revolutionary intelligentsia . The source of radicalism among the intelligentsia",0
"In a short campaigning season curtailed by either seasonal or financial considerations , or by both , the advantage did not lie with the attacker who , if he began a siege , risked being caught between the place he was seeking to capture and ( a constant fear ) a force coming to relieve the besieged . Further , he would also require some very heavy and unwieldy equipment , including siege engines ; even these might not bring the desired success . It might require a stroke of luck , such as a shortage of provisions or water among the besieged , or an act of treason , to deliver the well - defended place into enemy hands . In hostile territory a siege was not lightly undertaken ; if certain reasonable precautions had been taken , those who sought refuge inside a town or castle could reasonably hope to survive , in particular if their refuge were a town which , with its generally greater size and more generous ameneties which favoured the defender , presented a besieger with a greater challenge than did even the best defended castle . In France the escalation of war in the 1340s ( after some four generations of relative peace ) led to a number of significant developments .",0

"It is also possible to identify land scheduled for development in future years , particularly where the development of an area is delayed due to problems with infrastructure , for example where the release of land is delayed pending improvements to sewers or sewerage disposal facilities . Development plans show future road improvements which may affect development , for example where new access onto an existing road is not permissible . By reading between the lines and closely studying local plans , it is sometimes possible to identify the probable expansion or pressure points on defined village or town boundaries , thus identifying land with hope value . Due to demographic changes , such as falling population , land can be released for residential development which was previously designated for other uses , such as schools and recreation grounds . The owners of such land may be unaware that circumstances have changed and the developer may have the edge in being able to acquire the site .",0

"In part , Southey 's changed manner reflected his desperate irritation with someone whose procrastinating habits had become unignorable in the cramped spaces of 25 College Street ( Coleridge admitted to Southey that ‘ you sate down and wrote — I used to saunter about and think what I should write’ ) . But more important were Southey 's fundamental doubts concerning the likely success of Pantisocracy in any form .

The final breach grew from Southey 's good fortune in being offered an annuity of £ 160 during the summer of 1795 . Thereupon Southey announced that , Pantisocrat or no , his private resources were his own , and that on the Welsh farm each person should manage his own affairs .",1

In some companies rank is measured in terms of floor space , and the most sought - after offices are those with large window space . High status is indicated through inaccessibility , human and physical barriers keeping the rank and file at a distance . Phone calls are thoroughly screened ; people have to make appointments a long time in advance . Someone who has a lot of overt status has a great deal to do : their time and attention are very precious .",0

"It does not help that the Singapore dollar has been appreciating against not only the greenback but also the currencies of Singapore 's three main trading rivals : Hong Kong , Taiwan and Korea . The lion 's share of Singapore 's exports is produced by the 3,000-odd foreign companies that have set up on the island . Its future depends on continually convincing these companies , and others yet to take the plunge , that it is the best place in South - East Asia from which to do business .

"Pressures for change had been building up within the legislature for some time and these were to be given added impetus by the events surrounding the resignation of President Nixon . In 1970 the first Congressional reform bill for more than two decades was passed — the Legislative Reorganization Act . Among other things , this bill strengthened the position of rank - and - file committee members vis à vis chairmen . Thus , in the absence of the chairman the ranking majority member of a committee would preside . There was also an attempt to ensure full and free participation in committee hearings by all members and restraints were imposed on the use of proxy votes by chairmen ; in addition , all votes in committee and on the floor were now to be recorded and open to public scrutiny .",0
"This has brought in a new dimension to recent thinking , and begun to raise sharp questions about what has been called the ‘ Latin captivity’ of western theology . This fresh ecumenical contact and its opening of new horizons has by no means been restricted to the meeting of Christians with Christians . The question of the relation between Christianity and other world faiths has taken on a new urgency in a time where , for instance , an Indian Christian must take stock of his position vis - à - vis his Hindu fellow - countrymen , or a British or American Christian finds himself living alongside adherents of other religions in his own homeland . That issue has been sharpened even further by the fate of the millions of Jews murdered in Nazi extermination camps — a fate for which centuries of Christian anti - semitism must bear at least part of the blame . While in this survey we are chiefly concerned with modern Protestant theology , and with its main development in the west , the impact upon it of this new ecumenical awareness can not be left out of account .",0

"I remember that he liked one in celebration of wool ; another was of everything brown or gray , for which I had arranged a large collection of natural objects , of woven and blockprinted textiles , pots , and beautiful bowls and boxes made of wood . He teased me about the way in which I always created a background for these exhibitions , isolating them from their surroundings , by arranging a roll of six feet high gray or white corrugated card in columns and bays . It amused him too that I used only pins to mount most of the items on the card . It must have been rather unnerving for him to see his room thus turned upside down . But because he knew that I and my group would be careful he happily let me use his basic materials — boards , palettes , etc . — and we brought our own paints and dyes and drawing materials .",1
"I have found no evidence that at any stage anyone said ‘ what is this Sterling Area , and is it obviously a good thing for Britain?’ Typically , the sterling area was assumed a ‘ good thing’ , the justification of which needed only to be made to foreigners ( especially Americans ) . The major economic argument for the area was as a way of expanding the zone of multilateral trade in the short run , and as a source of ‘ highly beneficial trading and banking relations’ . While such a view is not absurd , it hardly touches on the issues which would have to be addressed for any overall assessment . Though the authorities do not seem to have been aware of the scale and significance of capital flows within the sterling area , they were aware that the exchange controls in that area were not all that London hoped .",0
"After a spring and summer during which he was so busy with his ordinary duties that he had no time to himself at all— not even his evenings — he returned again to America in the late autumn of 1950 .

He spent one night in New York and then , nursing a cold which he had contracted on the boat , he went straight to Boston — with his relatives , in particular his two sisters and his late brother 's family , and with old friends like Emily Hale and Djuna Barnes , he could still enjoy an affectionate intimacy which he seemed to lack in England .

"For example , a sample of naturalistic speech , on a tape recorded in the child 's home , is probably not directly comparable with a sample taken while the child is in a school or clinic . Even in the case of language tests , it is possible that situational factors will influence a child 's performance and hence make comparisons between two sets of scores difficult to interpret . For example , a child who is assessed while slightly under the weather or simply in a bad mood will be likely to perform below par , and a comparison of this assessment with a prior or subsequent assessment will provide a distorted impression of any real changes which have occurred . Evidence of change may be useful in deciding whether or not a child requires special placement , and it is likely to be particularly helpful when discussing the child with other professionals or parents . However , in addition to providing information about the child , an indication of change over time may also be helpful in evaluating the success of previous attempts at remedial intervention .",0

"His submission was that where the words of a statute were ambiguous or obscure or were capable of giving rise to an absurd conclusion it should be legitimate to look at the Parliamentary history , including the debates in Parliament , for the purpose of identifying the intention of Parliament in using the words it did use . He accepted that the function of the court was to construe the actual words enacted by Parliament so that in no circumstances could the court attach to words a meaning that they were incapable of bearing . He further accepted that the court should only attach importance to clear statements showing the intention of the promoter of the Bill , whether a minister or private member : there could be no dredging through conflicting statements of intention with a view to discovering the true intention of Parliament in using the statutory words . In Beswick v. Beswick [ 1968]A.C. 58 , 74a Lord Reid said : ‘ For purely practical reasons we do not permit debates in either House to be cited : it would add greatly to the time and expense involved in preparing cases involving the construction of a statute if counsel were expected to read all the debates in Hansard , and it would often be impracticable for counsel to get access to at least the older reports of debates in Select Committees of the House of Commons ; moreover , in a very large proportion of cases such a search , even if practicable , would throw no light on the question before the court .",0

"Commercial firms marketing goods for the infant consumer hand out subsidized baby books as part of their advertising policy ; others run advisory services or distribute regular magazines in which child care is discussed . In the publishing world as a whole , periodicals concerned with the family become more and more specialized : quite apart from the dozens of magazines addressed to women generally , we find some catering for the interests of parents in particular , some especially for the ' mother to - be ' , and others for parents of individual age - groups or of children with special characteristics or handicaps . Books about childhood appear on every level , from those in which specialist communicates only with specialist , through all types of handbook for readers with a vocational interest in children , to those in which the expert and the less expert , with equal show of authority , make parents the target of their beliefs ( substantiated or not ) on how children ' should ' be brought up . And , in support of the printed word , television and radio move in with their advice and discussion programmes , educational bodies run courses in psychology for parents , parent - teacher associations organize lectures , and one can even learn from a gramophone record how to teach one 's children about sex . Seen in historical and anthropological perspective , perhaps the most interesting aspect of the contemporary preoccupation with childrearing is that today we are self - consciously concerned with the possible psychological consequences of the methods which we use in bringing up our children .",1

"John Hunter , one of the most eminent surgeons of the eighteenth century , was responsible for lending weight to the belief that syphilis and gonorrhoea were the same disease , as a result of a fateful experiment . He himself was convinced that they were separate entities , and decided to prove this once and for all by inoculating himself with pus from a patient with a gonococcal discharge . With a tragic stroke of luck that set venereology back many decades , the patient from whom he collected the pus was also suffering from syphilis , and Hunter went on to develop both gonorrhoea and syphilis . In spite of mercury treatment , Hunter developed syphilitic involvement of the heart , which caused his early death . In 1732 Thomas Dover published a treatise in which he advocated metallic mercury as a treatment for a variety of medical complaints apart from syphilis and pointed out that , taken in this form , it did not cause the side - effects of other mercury compounds .",0

"This is no easy task when it is aimed at an entire work force and when the normal reading habits of the employees may range from The Times at one end to The Sun at the other . A number of questions should be asked : what is the objective of the journal ? who will drive the publication , managers , shop floor workers , the unions , project groups ? how much power will the editor have ? who has the final power of veto ? A glossy magazine designed to satisfy the CEOs ego may go wide of the mark with the factory workers . Externally , a range of print media is available for the insertion of company propaganda , should the occasion arise . Careful thought regarding suitable journals for advertisements , advertorials or articles may help to dissuade workers considering strike action , for example , while good on - going press relations can do much to fortify not only the publics image of a company but also reinforce the workers sense of pride in belonging to such an organisation .",0

"It was also passed , rather reluctantly , by the Lords . However , the number of defeated Commons amendments convinced Lloyd George and his Treasury civil servants that future pressure for costly extensions of the measure were inevitable . The civil servants belatedly regretted their refusal to set up contributory machinery which , though costly in the short run , would have shifted the cost of future changes in the scheme onto the contributors . They seem also to have underestimated the likely future increase in the cost of pensions due to the increasing numbers living into old age .

In the short run it attempted to detach itself from its ' extremist ' wing — more properly , those sections of the Labour Party which the right - wing popular press considered extreme — on the grounds that the ' loony left'cost it electoral votes .

"This changed with the advent of floating exchange rates in the early 1970s , which allowed more stability - conscious countries , such as Germany , to decouple from a US monetary policy that they considered too inflationary . But , even under floating exchange rates , the US retained an advantage : given that the dollar remained the key global reserve currency , the US could finance large external deficits at very favorable rates . Today , the US Treasury can still borrow unlimited amounts at rock - bottom interest rates . Indeed , the interest rate on inflation - protected bonds has now become -0.5 % , even for a five - year maturity !

If Labour wins tomorrow these people face a massive cash squeeze , with little hope of adjusting their expenses in the short - run . The predicament of this group could have severe economic repercussions for the region as a whole . Those caught in the ‘ genteel poverty trap’ can expect little sympathy from people earning the national wage of £ 15,790 or less .",0
"Presently , she grew a little more adjusted to the noise and she began to make out the details a little more plainly ; she could see that the captives were all young men , some of them not much more than boys , but certainly strong and lithe . She thought that not one of them could be more than eighteen or twenty , and she remembered how it had been said that the Robemaker scoured Ireland , taking the sons of the ordinary Irish families to work here . And then Caspar , who had been narrowing his eyes and taking stock of everything and everyone , suddenly gripped Fenella 's arm and said , in a voice from which most of the breath had been driven , ‘ Fenella — over there.’ ‘ What —’ ‘ The Prince,’ said Caspar , softly .",0
"Football fans the world over will always remember the outrageous error that awarded France the decisive goal against Ireland to qualify for the tournament , despite obvious hand - play by the French superstar Thierry ~ Henry . We believe that a concerted effort to reform football ( soccer ) refereeing is urgently needed . Refereeing errors increasingly mar the game on all its levels – country and club , major and minor leagues , globally televised tournaments and matches , and local games . Since such errors have major implications for the outcome of key tournaments which define this most global of sports , their ubiquity and frequency jeopardize the game 's very integrity – and thus its essential legitimacy . Such episodes , after all , are increasingly part of the public domain , owing to new media that have rendered the game even more global than it was .",1

"Quote : ‘ It seems likely that a diet in which sugars and starches are taken in natural fibre - rich form would contribute to the control of obesity by encouraging satiety at a lower level of energy intake , and to a lesser extent by increasing the amount of potential energy lost in the faeces .’ What that means , in simple English , is that if you follow a high - fibre diet you will find that you feel more satisfied on fewer calories . And more of the calories that go into your mouth will , to put it bluntly , go straight through and down the lavatory . Of course , the fewer calories the body uses from food the more it must draw from your surplus body fat , so this adds up to faster weight loss . Another simple definition which will appeal to everyone who has ever tried to slim : More weight loss for less willpower !",1

"Across the road from the churchyard is Poosie Nansie 's pub , the setting for Burns 's poem ‘ The Jolly Beggars’ , and is as welcoming today as it was in the time of Scotia 's bard . In the bar is a superb chalk drawing of the drinking scene from ‘ Tam o ' Shanter’ , complete with Tam , and Soutar Johnnie ‘ at his elbow’ . Burns 's poetry and songs have played an important part in my life from the earliest years , not only because of their simple beauty , but also because of their directness , honesty , and wry , lop - sided , humour ; the appreciation of which stood me in good stead the last time I was in Mauchline . A Glasgow friend , Tony Sykes , a great fisherman , at least he kept telling everyone he was , persuaded me against my better judgment to join him for a day 's salmon fishing on the River Ayr at Mauchline .

"I rushed outside , looked up and opened my mouth to let the flakes drop in . The snow settled on my tongue and it was so cold that I cried . My toes went numb , and at the primary school that we attended I was n't allowed to wear long trousers at my age . The teachers made us go out to play in the snowbound playground and I joined in with all the fun , sliding around in the snow and slush , throwing snowballs , all the usual things .

"Yes , the US economy has been on a weak recovery trajectory over the past three years . But at ~ least it ’s a recovery , claim many – and therefore a source of ongoing resilience in an otherwise struggling developed world .

"I get to work and I can concentrate,’ Linda said . ‘ Lots of people will consider returning to work if they think they have good quality childcare.’ Nadine Dorries of Company Kids says predictions five years ago that by 1992 workplace nurseries would be as common as staff canteens were wide of the mark .

At the touch of her dry , quick hand , which he remembered on his back , his neck , his thighs , his cock , the bridge of flesh at the root of his balls , he felt a shiver run through his limbs of renewed longing again . She caught sight of it and put up her other hand , and with a finger stroked his bottom lip until he flinched and turned his head away , parting his lips as he did so however to bite her finger slightly , and close on it . Even as he felt the danger of his need sweep over him , he perceived another danger beneath it : he let the pleasure of her carry him off , but within his pleasure 's flow a small bitter seed remained , as it were stuck between his teeth , offering him warning .

On Sept. 12 Aquino ordered an indefinite ceasefire in Manila and the earthquake - hit northern areas — Baguio City and the provinces of Benguet , Mountain and Neuva Vizcaya — with a view to expanding it later .

"The aristocracy travelled much for non - utilitarian purposes , but in ways which have nothing in common with modern tourism . Noble families moved from town house to country house and back again at regular seasons , with a train of servants and baggage vehicles like a small army .

"Bentham arrived at it via his belief in the universality of reason and hence the possibility of correctly socialising man 's instinct for pleasure ; Howard by his belief in original sin , guilt and the possibility of awakening man 's consciousness of sin . Anyway , whatever the ideas that inspired the advocates of the prison , it would obviously be very dangerous to assume that their ideas were automatically embodied in the actual operation of the prison system when it came into being . Garland ( 1985b ) , in his detailed consideration of the Victorian prison system , concluded that , for Britain at least , Foucault 's characterisation is wide of the mark . Individualised reformation as a dominant penal principle did not emerge here until the early part of the twentieth century , when positivist criminology was in the ascendant ( though , again , that is not to suggest a simple causal relation ) .

With climbers , I 've always believed in the more the merrier , but it 's important to team up your plants so that one does not swamp and ruin another .

"This realignment of the Fed ’s dual mandate , which I have called the “ reverse Volcker moment , ” has been evident for a few months . Let me explain by going back to the end of the inflationary 1970s , when President Jimmy ~ Carter appointed Paul Volcker to lead the Fed . In order to prevent pathological inflationary dynamics from becoming embedded even more deeply in the structure of the economy ( including through wage indexation ) , Volcker dramatically changed the policy stance and made inflation public enemy number ~ one . The equivalent of today ’s policy rate rose to 22 % as he launched a bold anti - inflationary crusade , accepting significant upfront costs for gains down the road . This “ Volcker moment ” was , as students of economic history know , the catalyst not only for “ winning the war against inflation , ” but also for a multi - decade shift in conventional wisdom about central banking .",0
"The truth is that comic illustrator and award - winning architect have both been greatly influenced by the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright .

The London Borough of Hammersmith has previously rejected inspired schemes by at least two of Britain 's most interesting architects .

"The examples developed here are heavily biased towards the leadership and intellectual rationalization for the movement . It has been estimated that 60 per cent of the fascist elite had been members of the armed forces and over 40 per cent saw active service in the first World War . However , it should not be forgotten that the unofficial populist ideas of the rank and file , particularly with regard to anti - semitism , unemployment and political violence , were often significantly different from the formulations of the leadership . Many at all levels of the movement , who were too young to have had experience of the First World War , were nevertheless affected by its indirect effects . They saw the military discipline , anti - socialist politics , the threat of confrontation with left - wing elements , and anti - semitic baiting of immigrants and British citizens of Jewish religion , as a source of excitement which gave meaning to a dull existence .",0

"‘ A man of sound mind will cherish no extravagant notions of divine communications . He will consider his own nothingness and will form the most lofty conceptions of God , as chiefly manifesting his wisdom by the general rules according to which he directs his administration .

"SPENDING Christmas zapping aliens or helping Sonic the Hedgehog to dodge graphic nasties might sound mindless to parents — but it could be great mental exercise for thousands of computer game - crazy youngsters . We invited 12-year - old James Freebody from Ilford , Essex , to play a Super Nintendo NES game and asked psychologist Dr Dorothy Einon to find out how it affected him . Dr Einon , an expert in children 's play , put James through a series of tests to probe his IQ , memory and creativity before and after four hours of playing Super Adventure Island , in which Master Higgins battles to rescue Jeanie Jungle from the wizard Dark Cloak . She found no change in James 's IQ . But his memory and creativity scores increased after playing the game , even though he was tired .",1
"The other major case , which later separated into two , involved the murders of two boys aged 14 and 6 , which obtained fairly intensive coverage over a five - day period in the popular dailies . The only other case where there was the suggestion of an explicitly sexual motive and which had more than three days ' coverage was the murder of a 9-year - old boy which was reported in two national newspapers — the Daily Mail ( on three days ) ; the Daily Mirror ( on one day)— and much fuller coverage in the local newspaper , the Lancashire Evening Post . Apart from these four cases — all involving children — the other murders where there was a sexually explicit motive were few and far between , mentioned in perhaps two or three newspapers over a couple of days at most . This was a surprising finding for it was thought — with the image of the Yorkshire Ripper search in mind — that the police investigation of major sex murders would be a prime fodder for newspapers . So apart from the M4 Rapist , there was not sustained or widespread coverage of sex murderers killing adult men or women in the sample year .",0

"In my grandmother 's oft - repeated phrase , ‘ Pocklington was riddled with saddlers’ . Upon their marriage they had moved from Allerthorpe to the market town and in 1881 were living and working in the Market Place , next door to Henry King the ratcatcher and close to two other saddlers . The competition made them decide to move to Easingwold , some 22 miles away as the crow flies and nearer 28 miles along the winding roads . I always regret that as a youth it never occurred to me to ask why they chose Easingwold and how they knew of a vacancy for someone who could combine the saddlery trade with being the landlord of the Jolly Farmers pub . Nor did it occur to me then to enquire how it was possible in those days for a keen Wesleyan Methodist to become a publican .",0

In Oslo yesterday , diplomats warned that the Nobel committee had a reputation for security and the leaked forecasts might prove wide of the mark . Even so , the committee is unlikely to match the surprises of the ‘ alternative’ Nobel prizes , awarded yesterday by the Right Livelihood Society , which singles out ecologically - sound solutions to problems .

"Steady progress has been made with the implementation of non - advanced DATEC courses and in January and May 1981 461 students were registered for Certificate courses and 2,866 for Diploma courses . For various reasons , DATEC decided that , with one exception , no college proposals would be validated for Higher Certificate and Higher Diploma courses which would allow a start before September 1982 ; as a consequence , there are at present relatively small numbers of students on these courses . DATEC hopes that there will eventually be a total of about 20,000 students on all its levels of courses , in some 170 centres , including a much higher number of girls than at present . However , it may take some considerable time to reach this target ; as the majority of DATEC courses are run in separate art colleges and these have been particularly squeezed by the current financial crisis , they are finding it particularly difficult to make the desired provision . As is the case with TEC courses in general , the influence of DATEC on the art colleges has been considerable and they have been brought into curriculum development on a considerable scale .",1

"Social routes into heroin use The way a person comes into contact with heroin , is offered it , and accepts it , is intimately related to the heroin use of the significant others in that person 's life . That is to say , heroin use does not come ‘ out of the blue’ ; people are initiated into it via social mechanisms that include ideologies as to what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behaviour . Approximately 65 per cent of the interviewees were introduced to heroin by a close friend or workmate ; 20 per cent , mostly women , by their partner ; 10 per cent by their regular dealer of other drugs ; and 5 per cent by a member of the family . Thus , contrary to the mythology propagated by the ‘ popular’ Press , these user histories point to the fact that , at street level , heroin use is more likely to spread along friendship and family networks ( 90 per cent ) , than via the ‘ evil pusher’(10 per cent ) ( see also Pearson 1987 ) .",0

It is unfortunately very easy sometimes to let the eyes wander — and the mind as well— if an elderly person is running the gamut of a whole list of troubles , some of which may seem more like minor irritations . Sometimes , too , it is possible to make the mistake of thinking that she is expecting us to come up with all the answers when , often , all she wants is the opportunity to state the problem to someone who understands and will not criticise her .

"When bonds came on the market after this time they were sold quietly by the Bondholders Committee to members of the Club with a long term , proven interest in its affairs , who had either enquired about bonds or were offered them being regarded as suitable individuals . This practice ensured as many bondholders as possible were reliable club members . And thirdly , when buying out looked more likely from the 1960 's onwards , as members increasingly voiced dissatisfaction at the Club 's management , some existing bondholders played hard to get , clearly reluctant in several instances and for reasons unrecorded , to give us what it had never been intended should be a permanent arrangement or the basis of an elite . Their right to elect a 2:1 majority of the Club Committee was regarded as undemocratic , and this was exacerbated by their relative numerical ratio to club members being greatly out of scale .

"This is the question an increasing number of consumers are asking themselves in the financially straitened Nineties .

More and more people are choosing to pay off the full amount on their credit cards at the end of each month — using them like charge cards to avoid interest charges .

"The CSA 1985 is a complex piece of statutory craftsmanship , and all of its provisions do not directly concern us . We will , therefore , focus on only a few aspects , namely : primary insider trading , secondary insider trading ( tippee trading ) , tipping , and counselling and procuring others to commit an offence under the Act . A concise statutory definition of insider dealing is not offered in the CSA 1985 , but conduct constituting insider dealing may be said to exist where : an insider deliberately deals as principal or agent on a recognised exchange in securities of the company in question on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information with a view to making a profit or avoiding a loss . The point at the very heart of anti - insider dealing legislation is the prohibition on the use of valuable information . The law is called upon to distinguish between information which may be legitimately used to make a stock market trade , and that which may not .",0

"When was that about , what year would that be ?

Ca n't tell you how long a journey it was back in the fog from Liverpool that day , and then when we were relegated back again to the third division it was on the last match of the season against Charlton , and the heavens opened and a big thunder storm and it just flooded the pitch and the referee just called the match off and they had to play it again the following Friday and Charlton ran out two - one winners and Walsall finished with nine fit men and still that 's the football I suppose .

In summer they lived in conical tents or huts roofed with birch - bark , and sometimes on houseboats similar in appearance to the Chinese sampan . The transport animal in the middle Ob and Yenisei regions was originally the dog , but its use to pull sledges was on a primitive level , and only the Khantys and Mansis sometimes harnessed dogs in teams .

"It was becoming more widely accepted by our management that , with the increasing sophistication of our craft and equipment and the growth in crew numbers , proper training for all crewing officers was becoming essential . About this time a change in the Department of Trade regulations regarding the qualifications of ships ' officers was being introduced .

This interaction may or may not achieve a successful conclusion for both sides depending on their level of skill .

Middlesbrough had tested Norman 's reflexes just before half - time when he managed to get his knees in the way of a hard , low shot from Jon Gittens , which might have levelled the scores . And the Roker goal had another close call when Middlesbrough 's influential midfielder , Andy Peake , struck a powerful drive which Owers managed to scramble away . The Teessiders seemed to sense that the Rokermen were starting to wilt and in the 62nd minute it looked as though Middlesbrough had finally found a way through .

"To be really competitive coal must be near its market and where the distances are thousands of miles — far enough to use up most of the coal being carried just to keep the coal train going — gas pipelines make more sense , especially when there is also a significant export market at the end of the line . Coal as an export commodity is to some extent a casualty of the shift in the economic mix of the Western industrialised nations away from energy intensive ‘ smokestack’ industries and towards higher added value , higher technology industries . Moscow has attempted , for example , to enlist Japanese help to develop Yakutia and Eastern Siberia with a view to exporting both LNG and coal . A decade ago huge sums were invested in the construction of the BAM railway to provide an infrastructure for exports to Japan and the US . A number of large projects were discussed , but only one of the Soviet - Japanese projects has gone ahead — the open cast Neryungri coal mine .",0

The Census , which until ten years ago existed only on index cards and photographs in the Warburg 's Photographic Collection , seems to have had its origins in a project allocated by Fritz Saxl to Alfred Scharf who had come to London as a refugee from Vienna around 1935 . Its purpose was to provide art historians with examples of antique sculpture that were definitely known to Renaissance artists such as Donatello and Ghiberti and influenced their work . The raw material came from such sources as Renaissance sketchbooks , engravings and travel guides and was originally limited to Antique works of art known between 1400 and the conquest of Rome by Charles V in 1527 .",1

"Often , you have asked yourself if there is a power out there that is supposed to help when you need it . You have asked why it does not give you what you require . The answer to that is that nine times out of ten you do not know what you really want , you do not know your own mind and have not made a choice . You are hampered by fear of the consequences of a new choice , the fear of the unknown , of being alone , of the world you have readily accepted in the past . By not knowing and by feeding these fears , you have played into the hands of the mentor whose dedication is to keep you away at all costs from your higher self and who will feed off your essence and life energy , as without these it can not live .",0

"In this Karajan proved the catalyst everyone had been waiting for . Whilst the record companies sat on their hands , nervous of another quadraphonic - style fiasco , Karajan announced after seeing the new technology as a working prototype that he would make no new recordings and sign no new contracts with any company that was not committed to digital recording and the earliest possible launch of the compact disc . Whilst one of Karajan 's recording companies held back , the Deutsche Grammophon - Polygram group took the plunge . At the 1981 Salzburg Easter Festival , the Herbert von Karajan Foundation in Salzburg teamed up with Sony , Philips , and the Polygram group to announce the imminent launch of the compact disc .

"Such ' network ' surveys are less vulnerable to ' norm and deviation'criticism , since they usually eliminate major social variables like class and ethnicity ( that is , group members studied are all one class and race ) , so that the group itself becomes the norm . Network theorists are interested in questions like which individuals conform most closely to group norms , who innovates and who resists innovation , and how changing social conditions at the local level — rehousing or factory closures for example— affect the group 's linguistic habits . This focus on the micro level of social or community structure discourages stereotypical generalisations . I do think , however , that Jenkins and Kramarae are still right about the treatment of women . There is in sociolinguistics an implicit assumption that where women 's speech differs from men 's , it is the behaviour of the women rather than the men that requires explanation ; men are the norm from which women deviate .",1
"It is clear that the Government are determined that the Bill will be on the statute book before the general election . I understand that a timetable motion is to be introduced on Second Reading — a procedure which I have not experienced . All that is intended to clear the decks because the Government think that the council tax may be the remedy to their problems . The Bill perpetuates all the anomalies , unfairness , regional variations and bureaucracy that made the poll tax unpopular . I suspect that those of us who continue our work as Members of Parliament after the next general election will find our surgeries just as busy with people complaining about the council tax and its anomalies as we have during the past year as a result of the poll tax .",0

"Early on an August Saturday morning they set off at a great pace on the west side of the reservoir with the intention of following the ten mile bridleway right round the reservoir to a pub , where they planned to arrive two hours after opening time . Ian soon learned how to dodge the flying hooves of Boy and remain in control of his bike , but what he had n't expected was the clinging weight and depth of wet Wadhurst clay — somersaulting with a squelch into one of the deepest bogs which appeared regularly between the level stretches of good galloping ground where both could make good speed . Neck and spoke they raced for mile after mile , the horse only drawing breath to ensure Ian was there to open the gates along the way , and to use Ian as a guide when Sally got lost in the maze of the Clubhouse car park ! However , only Sally knew where the bridleway left the reservoir and headed to the pub , so she ensured she was in the lead at that point , and then promptly declared her race over as she would not risk galloping the remaining mile of road . Off Ian pedalled , to arrive at the pub a few seconds before Sally , but having been companions in adversity throughout the whole way , neither was going to claim outright victory , so agreed to declare a draw .",1
"All told , life expectancy has increased by two years for women in Britain in the last decade , and by two and a half years for men . Again , there is more than we would like to do , and more that in time we will do . But for the moment it is right to take stock of how much has already been achieved — to the benefit of us all . One could talk about many other areas of improvement : the huge 68 per cent increase in real spending ( over and above inflation ) by Government on community care services since 1979 ; the 29 per cent increase in real spending on the whole range of benefits for elderly people ; or , in a completely different field , the improvements in public transport which have , for example , seen the number of rail passengers increase by 14 per cent . Similar signs of progress and improvement are to be found across the board .",0

"The value of having such materials in brief and physically separate forms is that it is easier to manipulate ideas while they are still in note form than it is once you have written them out in prose . A note - form outline of the essay provides a clear conceptual structure , and offers you an overview , which — when inspected closely — should allow you to assess how coherent it is , and how clearly it moves to your conclusion . Sometimes , it can be useful to write each main point in the argument on a separate card or sheet of paper , and physically reorder them on a table in front of you , joining up the points in your mind with a linking commentary . ( How do you get from this point to this ? What is it that makes you want to put one point before another ? )",1

"Most importantly , he is responsible for the business side of the election and for the oversight and eventual declaration of expenses . There are strict limits on the expenditure which can be incurred by or on behalf of a candidate and a successful candidate who is discovered to have exceeded the limits may find himself unseated . Section 75 of the 1983 Act prohibits expenditure ‘ with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a candidate at an election’ on items such as meetings , circulars or other promotional activities by any person other than the candidate or his agent . The broadcasting authorities , which have in the past been accused of falling foul of the ancestors of this provision by reason of granting undue exposure to one particularly well - known candidate ( see Grieve v Douglas - Home [ 1965]SLT 186 ) , are now exempt ( 1983 Act , s.75(1)1 , but the press otherwise , even such a reputable journal as The Times , remains bound ( see R v Tronoh Mines and The Times publishing Co [ 1952]1 All ER 697 ) . Much of the obscurity surrounding this provision has been removed by the House of Lords in DPP v Luft [ 1976]1 A11 ER 569 , concerning the prosecution of members of an ‘ anti - fascist’ committee for incurring expenditure on the publication and distribution of literature attacking National Front candidates .",0
"He saw , therefore , that the masses could be bound to him only through constant psychological mobilization , demanding ever recurring successes . Until the middle of the war , the successes came , and spectacularly so , especially in the arena of foreign policy and military affairs , bringing many Germans who were far from Nazis into close identification with Hitler , revamping sagging morale , forcing open acclaim , prompting active participation — if shallow and largely ritualized — in support of‘his’ achievements , disarming potential opponents , making objections to Nazi policy difficult to formulate . This was , for example , undoubtedly the effect of the plebiscites staged in 1933 , 1934 , 1936 , and 1938 , in which the massive acclamation , though the product of intense propaganda and coercion and obviously in no sense a true reflection of the state of opinion , nevertheless reflected genuine widespread approval and admiration for Hitler 's accomplishments and persuaded waverers to fall in line . The plebiscitary acclamation which could always be mobilized by Hitler provided him with an unassailable base of popularity , and as such offered the regime legitimation both within Germany and in the eyes of foreign powers , allowing the scope for further mobilization and a gathering momentum of Nazi policy . The massive popularity of Hitler , recognized even by enemies of the regime , formed therefore a decisive element in the structure of Nazi rule in Germany .",0

"It consisted of a line of timber post - built ‘ halls’ and numerous sunken - floored buildings ; there is no formal plan and little can be seen of streets or boundaries . At contemporary Mucking , two Saxon cemeteries were found to accompany a widely dispersed scatter of sunken - floored buildings the same situation occurred at Eynsham in Oxfordshire . At Chalton in Hampshire and Cowdery 's Down near Basingstoke , the buildings were more regularly laid out but not extensive enough to be called villages , while at Catholme in Staffordshire and Thirlings in Northumberland , the earlier settlements had not only been abandoned , but probably forgotten when areas of ridge and furrow were laid out over the top . None of these sites had the classic village green and plan which we expected , and all were found by accident in open country , away from medieval settlements . In many parts of the country there has clearly been a shift of settlement in Saxon times and the implication of this is that a number of Saxon settlements remain to be found , away from the medieval villages , in what are former open field areas .",1

"Nevertheless the pursuit of policies based on national self - interest led to competitive depreciation and the introduction of tariffs and other trade restrictions .

The present system of managed floating does contain the possibility of direct conflict if official intervention is carried out at cross - purposes . Thus the central bank of country A might buy currency B in order to keep the domestic exchange rate at a competitive level , whereas country B might simultaneously try to keep the value of its currency down by buying currency A. In this manner a lack of cooperation , fostered by a system of floating exchange rates , can lead to conflict and mutually frustrating policies .

"During that year , Crawford also holidayed in Greece with his daughters Emma and Lucy . He had found little time for romance since his marriage ended . Former New Seekers singer Lyn Paul was linked with him briefly and , in a ‘ kiss- and tell’ interview , said , ‘ I think every time he took a girl out he compared her with his former wife , Gabrielle , and none of them came up to scratch.’ Another girlfriend was American actress Jane Summerhayes , one of the stars of the Broadway hit musical A Chorus Line , which came to London 's West End in the baking summer of 1976 . Soon he was spending most of his time rehearsing for Same Time , Next Year and she went back to America .",0
"In all fairness I saw some beautiful work from other members of the class , so obviously there was some virtue in the course , but not for me . I have , however , experienced ‘ design’ from the other side , as it were . I was working for a yarn firm who had just gone into the marketing of coned yarns — unfortunately they did not stay the course . The system started with a designer who drew the garment , noting details of trimming , colour and suchlike . then a pattern writer created a ‘ workable’ pattern from the drawing .",0

"Penny Thornton CAPRICORN — VERY few Capricorns have had a whale of a time in the past few years . You may have made progress , you may have known times of happiness and fulfilment , but they have been few and far between . In many ways 1993 marks the end of this pattern , but it may take the whole of the year to do so . Uranus and Neptune occupy the same degree of your sign on February 2 and October 24 and , although these periods may coincide with an awakening of sorts , you are bound to experience some sense of unreality .",0
"Aromatherapy can help many disorders , but for the best results it should form part of a holistic health regime . By this I mean we should look beyond the symptoms to the cause and to the prevention of illness . It is important to remember that illness does not strike ‘ out of the blue’ even though it may seem that way at times . There are many possible causes of ill health ; heredity plays a part ( most unfairly ) but , in the main , its origin lies in our mental state , life - style and diet . Holistic aromatherapy , in common with other holistic therapies , demands a great deal of commitment from yourself .",0

"As a result , the economy 's stock of capital grows more slowly , or even shrinks . This , in turn , reduces the ability of companies to supply any later upturn in demand , so inflationary bottlenecks are encountered at lower levels of economic activity . Measuring physical capital makes measuring inflation seem child 's play . Official figures for manufacturing show a capital stock that increased gently but persistently throughout the 1970s and 1980s . However , these figures do not capture the effect of scrapping .",0
"It is not at ~ all hard to imagine the whole strategy boomeranging in early 2009 , soon after the next US president takes office . Of ~ course , a strengthening of the oil currencies ( including not only the Gulf ~ States , but also other Middle ~ East countries and Russia ) would not turn around the US trade balance overnight . But oil countries do account for a large share of the world ’s trade surpluses , and a weaker dollar would help promote US exports to some degree , even in the short run . More importantly , it is imperative for US policies to be consistent across regions . How can the US Treasury , on the one hand , periodically flirt with labeling China a “ currency manipulator ” and , on the other hand , condone a similar strategy in oil - exporting countries ?",0
"‘ Are you saying that when I showed you Milada Pankracova 's letter to Cara , that was the first you knew of any interview?’ she asked , still feeling a shade staggered and needing a little more clarification . ‘ I 'm afraid so,’ he replied . But , before she could begin to feel at all mortified , ‘ Did I tell you how glad I am , heart and soul , that you came?’ ‘ Oh , Ven,’ she sighed . Though when some seconds later her brain began to function , ‘ So Lubor was n't teasing when he seemed suprised that you 'd agreed to an interview !",0
"He turned and , in the act of rising , felt his hat being swept from his head . He nearly fell over . When he had recovered himself he looked up the narrow lane and saw a young boy racing into the distance , the white straw hat clutched in one hand and waving at his side as his arms pumped the air with the effort of running . Well , Sandison thought , it was maybe a bit big for me anyway . He turned back to the little beggar girl but she had disappeared .",1
"Further information about the races and details of entry are available from — ‘ Fair sex’ have edge in guile Alton 's rugby men were outnumbered , restricted , sin - binned and generally given a rough ride when a hand - picked side took on the club 's ladies team in a fun game on Sunday morning . And they had to admit that what the ‘ fair sex’ lacked in muscle they made up for in guile as the ladies took a mid - game lead with a well - converted try . But the game , referred with a scrupulous lack of bias by ladies ' chairman Sue Hinkin , swung back in their favour and pride was restored as the men scraped to victory .",1
"The hon . Lady 's party seeks isolation for Scotland . I do not believe that that prescription is in the interests of Scotland or of the rest of the United Kingdom . I said that we would be taking stock , and I meant precisely that — taking stock on the basis of an increased vote in Scotland , on the basis of more Members of Parliament for Scotland and on ways of seeking to increase the strength of the Union . That is what I mean by taking stock . Mr. Dover",0
"But first in the day 's programme must be Lost John 's Cave . Lost John 's Cave is found very easily by rounding the end of the wall on the right and walking back alongside for 180 yards to a hollow where a small stream enters a black cavity in a low cliff ; a few yards further over a small rise is another less obvious orifice . These are the two entrances to Lost John 's Cave , the best known and most extensive underground system in the Leck Fell area ; it is highly complex and has passages descending on various levels to a depth of 460 feet . Clearly this is no place for novices but it is possible for them , if armed with a torch and wearing boots and clothes that do n't matter , to go into one hole and emerge from the other , the two entrance passages converging after fifteen yards of stumbling progress . The passage continuing beyond the junction is absolutely out of bounds .",1
"We should not blame him for being a man of his time but commend him for his remarkable vision and altruism . Alan Ayers , 35 Priestgate , Darlington .

"In 1859 , the number of winners ' medals had become too great to be attached to the silver arrow and the trophy was re - modelled in its present form , in which the original arrow is supported by a silver bow and crossed bolts , all standing on an ebony and silver plinth . In his book , The History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton , published in 1866 , James Paterson wrote that ‘ the annual competition at Kilwinning has been attended with a marked degree of interest’ and with improvements in ‘ the number and respectability of the company.’ As most of Paterson 's book deals with the histories of Ayrshire 's leading families , his comment on the shoot may have been coloured by a desire to please the gentry involved in the Society , as by 1870 interest had declined to rock bottom with no entries for the papingo shoot . An attempt to revive the contest in 1871 failed , as did another in 1882 . We can presume that the novelty of the Society had worn off for the capricious upper classes .",0
"‘ I 'd hoped he 'd still be grazing that pasture there.’ He waved an arm at an empty green field with mist rising from the cropped grass . ‘ He was last year about now but Easter 's late , I had n't thought on , and he 'll not move down until Palm Sunday like as not , and if he 's still over on the mountain he 'll be up Three Valleys Pass and that 's an hour and a half of a walk for him , going as the crow flies , but longer for us in the jeep because there 's no direct road — and then to get at him we 'd have to take a cart track that 'll be more like a river bed after yesterday 's rain . The thing is , he 'll likely not move till Palm Sunday , I should have thought on — we 'll take the old road over to Demontis 's farm and come back here at six this evening when Piladu will be milking . His wife'll be back then which is just as well — she cleans for the factor 's wife over at ‘ Il Calltuccio’ in the mornings .",0
"Alternative action in the High Court under s.100 of the 1936 Act requires no such permission but uncertainty as to whether the defence of best practicable means is available to such an action is a further deterrent to local authorities contemplating taking action under this section . Cable burning The activity of cable burning , that is the burning of insulation from cable with a view to recovering the metal is a source of obnoxious odours . Section 78(1 ) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 , makes it an offence to carry out this activity , unless it is done in a place registered under the 1906 Act , where controls can be exerted to minimise any pollution .

"Europe and America sold properties and companies from Hollywood to Sunderland to Japanese investors and turned increasingly to Tokyo 's bottomless pit to fund projects which could not be financed here . That cash is already drying up as Japan concentrates its resources at home . But as past foreign investment turns sour , including loans to projects such as London 's Canary Wharf , and domestic investment values fall , Japan 's banks — the largest in the world and once financiers to it — are feeling the pinch . Although the standards will not come into force until next year , most Japanese banks are either in breach of the Bank for International Settlements ' capital - adequecy ratios , or about to be . Not surprisingly , bank shares have led the stock market down .",0

"The one thing that drew me to Elsie was her disability . To explain why that aspect interested me particularly I have to tell you about the Butcher . Mr Gillis was nick - named the Butcher because in summer he wore a white trilby hat which he hung on the back of the door of his tiny glass - walled office in the corridor just outside the gymnasium . Rather like himself , his office was unusual ; it gave the impression of being an afterthought , a sort of architectural cul - de - sac . The corridor by the gymnasium was barely able to accommodate it ; it forced those walking past to do so in single file .",1
"Pride of place in the leather and wood - panelled coffee lounge is a portrait of Frank Wittenoom , the man who gave Mr Hancock 's father his start — he sold Mr Hancock Snr the land on which the wealth of iron ore was found . ‘ I think we were all going to pay the price for that’ , said a member of one of Perth 's oldest families . ‘ Honestly , Lang caused nothing but trouble in the Pilbara when he was first up there . He was always flying to Canberra , stirring it up , trying to create problems for the stations in the north - west.’ It fits the mystique surrounding the man that the mineral deposits were found through apparent chance .",1
"Instead of legislating to control damaging and unnecessary strike action , the Labour Government actually increased the powers and privileges of Trade Unions ( in 1976 ) . Workplaces continued to get ever more choked up , not just by strikes , but by restrictions on who was allowed to do what , a refusal to adopt new technology , and so on . Instead of controlling Government spending , and keeping the lid on inflation , the Labour Government borrowed more and more — increasing spending by over 12 per cent in just one year ( 1974–5 ) , and presiding over an inflationary spiral the like of which has never been recorded before or since . And the result of all this ? Britain indeed became the ' sick man of Europe ' .",0

"Greg had first read it as ' Homosexual ' , and that of course was the joke . Heterosexuality among English writers , it was being implied , was so much the exception to the rule as to demand special treatment . The whole of the introduction was a solemnly tongue - in - cheek exposition of this notion , though Greg had the impression that later the joke rather ran out of steam ( as the book very nearly did run out of authors to treat ) . The Ern Malley Affair , a slimmer volume , was an examination of a famous Australian literary hoax of the mid-'forties , in which bogus poems of impenetrable obscurity were foisted on a literary magazine . It was not clear why the matter deserved a book to itself .",0
"ULSTER students have been saddled with a new course — in horse sense . The BTEC National Diploma in Equestrian Studies at North Antrim College of Further Education is proving a thoroughbred .

At a canter , students tackle hurdles in equine science , horsemastership , stud operation and showing horses .",0
"The hair , dress and hat followed a similar sequence . My method throughout was to begin faintly , after which I progressed to more definite drawing in a suitable colour or tone . Broad transparent colour was then placed over the top to complete the effect , with minor details added as necessary . The attraction of doing a sketch like this is the speed at which it can be achieved . The basic idea can be captured in minutes and the total concept fully realised in , at most , a couple of hours , which is a lot faster than it takes for the same degree of finish to be achieved in any other medium .",1
"He referred to the Bible that had been presented to him by the people of Memel St on July 10 at the opening of their march . He said that ‘ the powers that be’ had presented him with a summons and the Protestant people had presented him with that book and he thought a parallel could be drawn between the two . The rank and file of the Ulster people are still loyal to the core , but he declared ‘ we have been badly led , both politically and religiously’ . He then declared that he and those with him on the platform had pledged themselves to pay no fines and refused to be bound over , ‘ and we have authorised no one to pay these fines for us . Any Protestant who does so will be a Lundy and a traitor .",0
"' The white is meant to represent purity and innocence . ' ' That 's pretty stupid , ' said Lili , ' considering that marriage means an end to all that .

Fresh greenskins were already forming up for the attack , spear - wielding infantry and archers among them , and towards the rear two huge Trolls shambled slowly through a sea of frolicking Snotlings . The assistant cooks heaved on the rope and the cook pot lurched slowly backwards .

"Revenge , in fact , is the key to all these movies , and also pinpoints one of the things that makes The Accused so different . The bullet in the groin at the end of Lipstick may be cathartic , and we may take a certain ghoulish delight in watching Farrah Fawcett in Extremities debate whether to bury alive in the garden the attempted rapist she has tied up in her house . But the solutions posed by these films are strictly on the level of fantasy ( for most of us ) , and moreover are individual solutions to a particular set of circumstances . Each film is resolved with the events which take place neatly closed off and contained , and with a return to’ normality’ . The ending of The Accused , on the other hand , offers up the possibility of change .",1

"The NFCC published an eleven - volume historical series entitled ' Eras of Nonconformity ' edited by C. Silvester Horne , a Free Churchman 's Legal Handbook to aid ministers and chapel officials , hymnals , leaflets ( 100 for 1s . ) and booklets . Political involvement at the national level was , as we shall see in Chapter 9 , fraught with dangers . On the local level , where a much greater chance of agreement could be assumed and where Hughes could not veto their action , political work was easier . J. Scott Lidgett , head of the Wesleyans ' Bermondsey Settlement , warned delegates in 1901 about their political work : The free Church Council , special emergencies apart , will therefore best serve the administration of its city or town , neither by meddlesome interference with it , nor by attempting to be represented as such in its political caucuses , or even on its administrative boards ; but by training men who , representing its views and coming under its influence , have at once the strength of character and the breadth of conception , which will cause them to secure its great ends … in the ordinary arena of public life .",1

"At any stage in life , we can improve our relationship with others by learning to be aware and to communicate . Communication does not necessarily involve words but can often be non - verbal too .

"The opposite style is to assume that the communication should be limited to exactly what there is to be communicated and that all else risks blurring the communication . Should negotiating executives discuss the political scene or the latest art exhibition before getting down to business ? Intuition suggests that communication should first be on a personal level and then on a business level because context is so important in communication , but much depends on personal style . Perhaps communication should be at the broadest possible level if that is done well ; if not , it should be only at that level which can be done well . Risk",1

Beneath the oral history lies a sad text of spies , betrayers , official reprisal and oppression , and heartrending devotion : ‘ Old Mrs Macdonald , after her guest had left the house , took the sheets in which he had lain , folded them carefully , and charged her daughter that they should be kept unwashed , and that , when she died , her body should be wrapped in them as a winding sheet .

Given that prices are assumed to remain fixed , their reaction to the building up of stocks in the short - run will be to cut back on output and lay off workers , thereby creating DD unemployment . Since this also has the effect of reducing the equilibrium rate of national income below Y o , increases in S , T or M may also be regarded as potential causes of DD unemployment . Possibility 3 : A decrease in the supply of money If the monetary authorities should decide to reduce the nominal money supply , the effect of this will be to raise the equilibrium rate of interest .",0

"These are : first , to explore through case studies and interviews with experienced educational practitioners the ways in which examination results are currently used and interpreted in schools and local authorities . Second , to consider in the light of their comments the substantive and statistical issues associated with such interpretations . And third , to investigate , in a number of schools and local authorities which have indicated their willingness to participate in the research , the strengths and weaknesses of existing data - bases with a view to helping to develop appropriate frameworks and contexts for their interpretation . Questions about how examination results should be interpreted are of interest in their own right but are also important in studies of school effectiveness and wider debates about how educational institutions should be evaluated and held accountable .

"Two very easy controls give heights of cut , from a maximum of 37 mm ( 1½ in ) , to 18 mm ( ¾ in ) . Low or high settings are obtained by adjusting the height of the rear roller and front wheels — the roller by means of two plastic levers , one on each side of the mower , at the rear . The height of the front wheels is obtained by pushing or pulling up two plastic adjuster plugs on the front of the machine , which adjust the height of the axle . A medium cut is given by setting the front wheels to low , and the rear roller to high . No tools are needed .",1

Or that London bobbies were too often to be found whispering sweet nothings to kitchen maids , and tucking into pastries in servants ' quarters on foggy nights , when they should have been out walking the beat . Perhaps the strangest think of all about the garotting panic of 1862 was that in the haste to describe the awful contours of the ‘ new’ crime , the equally ‘ unprecedented’alarms of 1856 were almost entirely forgotten , although the same complaints and accusations had been well rehearsed . Mr Punch , for example , had already invented the spiked steel collar and the other improbable trappings of his anti - garotting campaign ; and even the solemn judgements of The Times ( 10 November 1856 ) had been tempted from the paths of seriousness :",0

"A 2pc cut in base rates coinciding with the Chancellor 's Autumn Statement next week has been widely anticipated and Mr Bootle said he believed the downward trend would continue through to next year and stabilise at 5pc .

"And so that the village benefits from the wood in some way , erm like there 's a teak plantation they 've got going at the moment , and in ten years time , the teak will be used to carry electricity , so that the village can have some electricity as well , I mean it 's to do with giving the village something as well as trying to help the environment . And our other project will probably be in Malaysia , where we 're hoping to be able to fund lawyers to go and visit the indigenous tribes , and educate them about the Malaysian process of law , because at the moment I 'm sure you 'll know that various indigenous people have been blockading the logging roads that go on to their demarcated territory . erm Because the loggers have been , as I said earlier , logging 24 hours around the clock , and they 're supposed to be logging over a 70 year cycle , and they 're not because the companies have only got three year licenses , and basically the indigenous people have just had enough , so they started to block the logging roads . But they were then held in remand in prison , and did n't really know how to defend themselves , so this project will be sending lawyers into the Long Houses of the indigenous peoples , trying to educate them about the process of Malaysian law , and work it into their system of customary law , which is known as ADAT , whereby within the Long House , all the community leaders and the members within the community debate disputes over land rights , the forest , the use of it , and try and get them to use their customary law with a knowledge of the Malaysian legal process in order to form associations and fight being thrown into prison because they 're trying to defend the forest . A worrying thing at the moment is as I said we 're in close contact with is that the Malaysian Government is sending representatives over to visit the European Community Ministers in May , to try and say that there 's absolutely nothing wrong with what 's going on in their country with the logging , and they 're saying that people like Friends of the Earth are calling for a ban on timber , not because they care about sustained yield , but because we want to be able to sell our own wood , and this is to depress their trade .",0

"The prices of certain goods ( such as agricultural produce ) also seem to respond very promptly to changes in supply and demand . Even in certain labour markets , for example casual day labour , the price of labour can move apparently very freely . But there are other markets in which prices appear to move sluggishly and to be , at least in the short run , unresponsive to changes in supply and demand . Many labour markets appear to fall into this category , with wage rates being determined through complex institutional arrangements and bargaining processes which seem to imply that they will be less than fully flexible . The prices of certain goods too — notably manufactured goods — appear to be ‘ administered’ , or set for some time so that they do not respond immediately to changes in supply and demand .",0

"He was inexperienced and little known before he was propelled into the highest office by his friends ' ambition for him and by the deadlock between Long and Chamberlain in 1911 .

However , his candidature in 1911 had been aided by three factors : he was a Conservative rather than a Liberal Unionist , but he was the sort of Conservative who would be acceptable to Liberal Unionists as well ; he was a diehard in opinion , but he had remained loyal to Balfour 's policy throughout the recent twists and turns ; and he had staked a claim by his abandonment of his safe London seat to fight North - West Manchester in December 1910 ( at no real risk , for an alternative safe seat was always available to him if and when he lost ) .

The point is that black people are not only at a disadvantage in the job market on account of their colour , they also perceive sharply that this is so and , despite Johnson 's tongue - in - cheek addendum , the consciousness of belonging to a group which feels itself to be at a disadvantage is clear enough . Black kids , at a stage during their latter secondary - school years , begin to feel different because of their blackness . It may be a gradual , one might say glacial , movement of perception , piecing together items of experience which collectively form an awareness that colour places a black person at a disadvantage .",0
"Finds : Get to grips with a matchbox : John Windsor meets a man fired with enthusiasm for matchbox covers By JOHN WINDSOR AT A top price of £ 20-£30 —‘through the roof’ says Ian Hooker , with tongue in cheek — commemorative and advertising matchbox grips still cost peanuts compared with even the cheapest London saleroom collectables . Much other printed ephemera can be picked up just as cheaply , a boon market for collectors sharp enough to spot history mirrored in the disposable scraps of everyday life . Mr Hooker , a motor trade production foreman who began assembling the world 's largest collection of grips 12 years ago , has seen antique fair prices for rare ones rise from a fiver , two or three years ago , to the present £ 20-£30 , all due , he says , to the boom in advertising ephemera .",0

"One could go on and pick many other scriptures , you know in the erm the New Testament not only were there those three questions that we mentioned earlier on about salvation , but there are three unanswered questions in the New Testament in Mark chapter eight , Jesus asked that question of which there is no answer , for what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and looses his sole or what shall a man or a woman give in exchange for their soul , Jesus did n't try and answer , there is no answer to that question , then again in , in Hebrews chapter three , er chapter two and verse three there is an unanswered question , how shall we escape if we neglect so greater salvation , and finally one other the apostle Peter , he asked the question in , in chapter fo , first apostle in chapter four and verse seven seventeen for it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God and if judgment begins with us first , what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God again there is no answer to that question , simply because the answer is so horrific , it does n't bear thinking about , but thank God all maybe safe , all will not be safe , but all maybe safe , God has provided a salvation that is available to all and if we are not safe it is because we choose to reject his s , his offers of mercy , so we thank God that all may be safe , but the solemn fact remains is that all will not be saved , well that leads us on to , to this third proposition , not only that the bible teach that all maybe saved , not only does it teach that all will not be saved , but it is quite clear that some will be saved whom we did not expect to be saved , we can be quite sure about that because judgment does n't rest with us , way back Abraham says perhaps one of the most important statements in his life when he said there in , in , in Genesis chapter eighteen and we actually sang the wo tho the quotation in the song we just sang a few moments ago where he says will not the judge of all the earth be right , judgement is not yours and mine , that 's God 's prerogative and the other song that we 've been , the song that we 've been singing , that song by faber there 's a wideness in God 's mercy lets be honest we are so narrow with our mercy , our gra , our expressions of grace is so limited , but there 's a wideness in God 's mercy and faber says it 's got the wideness of the sea , there 's a kindness in his justice , which is more than liberty , David knew all about that when he was given the option , he said oh I 'd rather fall into the hands of God than into the hands of men , I 'd rather that God dealt with me than that my fellow man dealt with me , because with him there 's mercy , with him there 's grace , with him there is , there is long suffering and there 's compa compassion and there 's love , and faber goes on with the love of God is broader than the measure of man 's mind and the heart of the eternal is most wonderfully kind , now that 's all very well for the song writer to say that in a hymn and it sounds nice and it 's , it sounds good but is there a scriptural authority for this , is it really true , or is it just a nice song that we sing with , it does us good because we feel it 's a nice , there nice thoughts , well , surely we have it in the passage we 've been reading that there is there is a mercy with God , there is a kindness with God in ver in verse thirty of that chapter behold some who are last will be first and some who are first will be last it 's quite clear that some will be saved that we did not expect to be saved , and you can find example after example of this , it was a tremendous surprise to the onlookers when a very sinful woman annoyed to the feed of Jesus , it was a tremendous surprise to the Pharisee who rejected God , although he was such a good man , to find that the , er sorry to be rejected by God although he was a good honest upright man , and to find that the sinner was accepted by God , it was a tremendous surprise to the people when Zacchaeus who named you to be a sinner , an open twist there an evil man was saved by the Lord Jesus , you could save salvation has come to this house , it was a tremendous surprise when the law breaker who was dying on the cross beside the law Jesus was saved and went to be with him , with the Lord in paradise , it was a tremendous surprise to the disciples when Jesus preached the gospel and revealed himself to a gentile woman , who was an adulterer seven times over but he did and she was saved , it was a tremendous surprise to Ananias when the Lord revealed himself to on the road to Damascus and saved him , but he did , it was a tremendous surprise to the Apostle Paul that the Lord had saved him at all , he never got over it , he called himself the chief of sinners , but God 's grace , God 's mercy had been revealed to him , you and I when we get to heaven are in for a few surprises , the grace , the mercy of God is far broader and wider than our imagination , we 'll meet a lot of folk there that we did n't expect to see that leads me to a fourth proposition , not only will some be saved that we did not expect to be saved , but it 's clear that others will not be saved who expected to be saved there 's a passage in Luke thirteen , verses twenty five , let me read them again one the head of the house gets up and shuts the door you begin to stand outside and knock on the door saying Lord open up to us and then he will answer and say to you I do not know where you 're from , then you 'll begin to say we ate and drank in your presence , you taught in our streets , we know you Lord , we rubbed shoulders with you , we went to church , we experience those things , we knew the answers to the re to the questions but he will say I tell you I did not know where you are from , depart from me all you evil doers those words make it quite clear , here , there 's words of Jesus , there 's references to those who profess , to know the Lord Jesus Christ , but who do not in fact know him at all , they know bits and pieces about him , they 've seen him , you know it 's in its immediate context , they had seen him in the street , they had heard his teaching , there maybe those who had been fed by the , by the miraculous er multiplying of the loafs and the fishes , they had seen the miracle , some of them may have been healed by Jesus , they knew lots about him but they did not know him and he says I do not know you how many folk there are like this , they expect to be saved , perhaps because they go to church , perhaps because they 've got Christian parents , perhaps because they read their bible , perhaps because occasionally when they 're in trouble they prayer , they 've been confirmed , they 've been baptized , that , that they 're good , they 're honest , they 're not rogues , they would n't do a , a , a bad turn to somebody , not deliberately , they 're nice people but they , they do n't know the truth of what it says in God 's word , they do n't know the truth of Romans three and verse twenty because by the works of the Lord no flesh will be justified in his sight for through the law comes the knowledge of sin , does n't come the forgiveness of it , they do n't know the truth of Ephesians chapter two verses eight and nine for by grace you 've been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it 's the gift of God , not as a result of works that no one should boast , for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared before hand that we should walk in them , they do n't know the truth of er , er of Titus , chapter three and , and verse five where , where the apostle Paul says there , he saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness , but according to his mercy , how tragic it is to expect to be saved , to think you 're going to heaven and in the end to find that you 're not saved and Jesus says they 'll be many like that in that day . On that final day there will be many like that , little earlier on in the book of Titus in the first chapter Paul says in verse sixteen they profess to no God , but by their deed they deny him and all of this leads natural to the final fifth proposition not only does the bible teach that all may be saved , not only does it teach that however that not all will be saved , not only is it true and clear that some will be saved and we do not , do not , do not expect to be saved , not only is it quite clear that others will not be saved , who we expected to be saved , but finally it is quite clear that no one will be saved except by God 's way , and God 's way of salvation is very simply by repentance and faced .",0

"The only hope for firm government , willing to defend the Republic by confronting rightist subversion , vigorously prosecuting reform , yet allaying fears of social revolution , lay with Azaña , elevated to the Presidency of the Republic in May , and Prieto , the shrewd and combative leader of the Socialist Party 's moderate wing . A Prieto premiership was nevertheless ruled out by a Socialist leadership within which Largo Caballero and the ‘ bolshevizers’ were dominant . Unimpressed by Prieto 's insistence that Socialist moderation was the best defence against an ever more apparent flight by conservative Spaniards towards fascism , Largo Caballero , flaunting the label of ‘ the Spanish Lenin ' bestowed upon him by Pravda , preferred to beguile the Socialist rank and file with the prospect of an imminent collapse of capitalism and transition to socialism .

"Huge Dublin protest over Warrington outrage MORE THAN a thousand peace campaigners crowded into Trinity College , Dublin , last night to spell out one of the Irish capital 's most eloquent protests against IRA terrorism . University lecturers , politicians , trade unionists and showbusiness figures rubbed shoulders with the citizens of Dublin in an attempt to drive home a message of peace to the men of violence . At a rally orchestrated by a housewife and inspired by last weekend 's IRA bombing in Warrington , a series of speakers echoed pleas for an end to more than two decades of terror . The meeting was organised by Susan McHugh , a mother - of - two , who was sickened by the Warrington incident in which three - year - old Johnathan Ball died while shopping for a Mother 's Day present .",0

Gujerati families which live as joint families in Britain and do not have , or have never had , this strict but uneasy hierarchy must be few and far between . The women I spoke to were almost always subsidiary wage earners ; the money they brought in was essential for survival but was not the main wage of the family and their jobs were often far more unpleasant than their husband 's . Many of them were sweat - shop workers , for example , while the men in their families might have white collar jobs or be shopkeepers .",0

"What we are not told in this benign dispensation is that the modest freedoms that permit us to oscillate between radical free - marketeering and limited state intervention apply strictly to the rich countries . There has been no such softening in the rest of the world , which the west has now taken under its protective tutelage . The small , frightened freedoms that we enjoy are underpinned by a global system that requires that they be paid for by rigorous and intensifying dispossession of the poor of the earth , the destruction of the resource - base , the ousting of indigenous peoples who happen to occupy the last remaining deposits of ' raw materials ' to which the global market now stakes its superior claim . If western free - market fundamentalism has been faintly relaxed in the west , this is because it has been intensified in its export version . Whether in Ghana , the Philippines , Peru , Poland , India or Brazil , the same inflexible , totalising and unreasonable prescriptions are proffered by the experts of the IMF and the World Bank ; the aims of Gatt are to impose the same programmes —'macro - economic correctives ' , ' structural adjustment plans ' — a more intensive use of resources , more exploitation of the people , a competitive demolition of the very elements of life , in order that countries may ' survive ' the universal reign of the market .",0
"It appears to have been roughly analogous to , say , the investiture of the Prince of Wales .

If John had been of the same family as Jesus , moreover , his ‘ seal of approval’ would have carried the additional authority of a royal warrant . One thing , at any rate , would seem to be clear , and this is that Jesus , after his baptism in the Jordan , undergoes a significant change .

"In fact the function of such eye- and ear - witness accounts as the ‘ Kentucky fried chips’ incident is to authorize and authenticate the racialization of experience by making it seem like an entirely spontaneous and natural process , and one for which blacks themselves must be held responsible .

For all its underground samizdat quality , this document is designed to be discovered in order to draw the attention of the police authorities to the strength of rank - and - file feeling . So here the use of quasi - official language to make a series of provocatively racist statements serves to undermine the credibility of the authorized version of ‘ community relations’ by contrasting its unrealistic viewpoint with the putative realities of ‘ the job’ .

"New warnings for Second World Climate conference The Stockholm Environment Institute has issued a report recommending that limits be defined for average global temperatures and sea level . The report lists practical measures that , if implemented , will help restrict greenhouse gas emissions with a view to meeting these targets . Released by a group of independent scientists to coincide with the Second World Climate Conference , the report said that to minimise the risk of environmental damage , the rate of increase of average global temperature must be held below 0.2C per decade . An absolute increase of more than 2C above pre - industrial levels will , said the report , lead to "" rapid , unpredictable and non - linear responses "" .",0

Now , at Pac Bo , under Ho 's chairmanship , the Party cleared its ideological decks and prepared to take advantage of the even more extraordinary opportunities that would be presented to it by the Second World War . This , in fact , was the theme of the Eighth Plenum : to prepare for the thoi co , ' the moment of great opportunity ' .

As it turns out , a variety of studies that have identified adjacent users or producers in different ways suggest that spillovers associated with R&D expenditures can be fairly large . One US study found that spillovers lead to average cost reductions of between 5 and 13 per cent in the short run and 10–20 per cent in the long run , creating a divergence between private and social rates of return of 67 per cent in chemicals , 123 percent in petroleum , 30 percent in machinery , and 90 percent in instrument engineering ( Bernstein and Nadiri , 1989 ) . Another US study found that firms averaged 2 patents per $ 1 m of own R&D , and 0.6 patents per$1 m of rivals ' R&D , suggesting that own and rivals ' R&D are complementary ( Jaffe , 1986 ) . However , studies which try to measure the spillovers associated with specific innovations ( rather than those associated with R&D expenditures ) have found only very modest effects on the productivity growth and profitability of adjacent innovation users and producers ( Geroski , 1991 ) .",0

"The preacher there was Marcus Loane , who later became archbishop of all Australia , but was then only a young clergyman . He was leading Bible studies on the Book of Romans .

Still not sure how to set things right , and with Major Burrows back from the war , she began attending the Salvation Army again . By this time the family was based at Fortitude Valley , Brisbane , a "" tough little corps "" where the larrikins had knocked down the Salvation Army lasses when they were first trying to get established , and the crowd had pelted them with mud , stones and stale fish .",0
"Erm , I do n't , I do n't know what er people are er afraid of , or frightened of really , j just by sending a couple of delegates from the trades councils that would er voice the concerns of the rank and file , it 's not going to er set any dangerous precedents , and let 's , let 's not forget that those people would be from recognized trades unions as well . I mean , I take the point that there might be an opposition to some of their national officials , well it 's quite a good idea really the more I think about it erm , but I just really do n't see what there 's anything to be frightened about . Even if you go halfway , and just say that the trades council conference could send two delegates , not to put trades council motions , but to give the trades council 's view on important issues because the trades council representatives are representatives of the rank and file , they are the activists , they are the people like you , and I think they deserve a voice on a wider platform .

"Their findings , reported last year in the British Medical Journal , highlighted poor sanitary conditions in some inner London schools . Using school nurses to carry out their survey , the doctors investigated almost all the 41 primary and secondary state schools in their health district .

"Second , should LAWER be viewed as an acceptable outcome of the doctor 's responsibility towards well - known patients in great pain but unable to express wishes ? The present state of the hospice movement and continuing research on pain relief make us ask , ‘ is optimum pain alleviation being sought?’ It is up to the medical profession to take stock of advances in this aspect of practice . Yet , if pain remains , who would be so bold as to decide when the patient 's limit of tolerance has been reached ? If there is no blanket strategy that can be applied to all , then more and better individualised pain care is needed .",0

"There is , however , no systematic training for volunteers who become concerned over issues like the rainforest , the debt problem . We seem to assume , with rather typical British arrogance , that if , as volunteers , we become committed , we innately possess the knowledge and skills to recruit supporters ; organize and publicize meetings , start and run effective committees ; run workshops , organize campaigns ; interact with the media . My experience tells me that we do not all have all the necessary skills to do all these jobs well — it is often a hit and miss affair , with much poor practice . There is training , though not enough , available at considerable expense to staff working for NGOs , but training for volunteers is patchy and unsystematic , where it exists at all . To become more effective , we in the UK need more training for those who become involved .",0
"The bond channel does n’t work when bond yields are already low ; and the credit channel does n’t work when banks hoard liquidity and velocity collapses . Indeed , those who can borrow ( high - grade firms and prime households ) do n’t want or need to , while those who need to – highly leveraged firms and non - prime households – ca n’t , owing to the credit crunch . Moreover , the stock - market channel leading to asset reflation following QE works only in the short run if growth fails to recover . And the reduction in real interest rates via a rise in expected inflation when open - ended QE is implemented risks eventually stoking inflation expectations . Third , the foreign - exchange channel of QE transmission – the currency weakening implied by monetary easing – is ineffective if several major central banks pursue QE at the same time .",0
"Copyright protects expression not idea . Therefore , in principle , it is quite acceptable to write a novel about a secret agent in the style of Ian Fleming as long as it does not contain copies of parts of James Bond novels . The late Ian Fleming did not have a monopoly in tongue - in - cheek , humorous adventures about secret agents , but a novelist might commit the tort of passing - off if he changes his name to Ian Fleming or uses the name James Bond or the 007 code in his novel . Copyright protection , however , does not extend to ephemeral things such as skeletal plots for novels or ideas for computer programs unless and until they are recorded in some form or another and , even then , it is the ideas as expressed which are protected , not the underlying concepts . A literal copy of a computer program infringes copyright if made without the consent of the copyright owner .",0
"Liverpool 's main Euro trait down the years was always that the Reds did n't lose many goals in these type of games .

In my experience , the only thing Liverpool players ever used to worry about was the game in hand . They certainly wo n't be thinking of anything else tonight .",1

"Any manuscript submitted to a scientific journal , or any proposal sent to a granting institution , is subject to close scrutiny . In theory , these criticisms are designed to help researchers to improve their work by pointing out ( for instance ) poor techniques , illogical conclusions or misanalysed data .

For example , here is a cunning bit of advice one researcher received from an anonymous journal reviewer : ‘ This manuscript is terrible .

"BY electing new and reform - minded leaders , East Germany 's Communist party hopes to have won a breathing space in its battle for credibility and survival , six months before the first free elections are due to be held . The new chairman , Dr Gregor Gysi , told an emergency party congress at the weekend that the SED had made a start in ‘ breaking with Stalinism,’ but added that there was still a long way to go in ‘ overcoming Stalinist structures’ . By electing Dr Gysi by an overwhelming majority , the SED rank - and - file made a radical break with the past , rallying behind the party and its call for a ‘ democratic renewal of socialism’ . The SED underlined its willingness to leave behind old structures and traditions by abolishing the politburo and the central committee .

"The law therefore singles out the time direction of irreversible physical processes as the direction of increasing entropy . For example , imagine two cylinders of gas joined by a narrow pipe containing a valve that is at first closed , then open for a short time , then closed again . Somebody measures how the gas is distributed between the cylinders before the valve opens and after it closes , writes the results on two cards , and asks you to tell which card describes the earlier state and which the later . One way of solving the puzzle would be to use the second law . It is not difficult to show that ( other things being equal ) the more evenly the gas is distributed between the two containers , the greater the entropy ; so the state with the gas more evenly distributed between the two cylinders is the one that occurred later .",1
"Disputed origins of coup Cedras , confirmed as Armed Forces C. -in- C. by the National Assembly on Oct. 14 , characterized the coup as a "" correction of the democratic process "" , claiming that Aristide had adopted an autocratic style of government , had flouted the Constitution and was inciting mob violence . Local US embassy officials described the coup as the work of disaffected rank - and - file soldiers , who had compelled reluctant senior commanders to participate . Maj . Joseph Michel François , acknowledged by diplomats to have been a ringleader , insisted to foreign journalists that the main impetus had come from the ranks of the 8,000-strong army who feared the growing influence of Aristide 's new foreign - trained 50-member presidential guard . Other Western diplomats , local journalists and most political analysts claimed , however , that the coup had been rumoured for weeks and had a level of sophistication far greater than that expected from mostly illiterate soldiers in the ranks .",0
"Hill was the third generation of a family of prominent educationalists and social reformers , who had their origins in the radical Unitarian culture of eighteenth- and early nineteenth - century Birmingham . It was the same sort of low church dissenting background which had produced many first generation medics like Kay and Wakley . But by the 1860s Berkeley Hill had become integrated into the culture of London 's professional gentry , where experts rubbed shoulders with the leaders of upper middle - class and aristocratic society . Hill was professor of surgery and pathology at University College , London , with strong links to the military hierarchy through his marriage to the daughter of Sir Thomas Howell of the War Office . Rising professional status involved a negotiation of establishment culture , and Hill dropped many of the public trappings of his evangelical background — embracing Anglicanism and sending his son to Eton and Oxford .",0

Numerically , Miliutin wrote , Russia 's forces looked strong , but it was doubtful whether they could withstand the fresh and well - organized armies which the enemy would be putting into the field against them . Losses in the three campaigns which had already taken place meant that most of Russia 's rank - and - file soldiers had been recruited recently and that there were not enough officers to train them . Even if the troops currently under arms could be knocked into shape , finding yet more reserves of manpower was going to be difficult .

The conservatism of the British financial institutions biasses them against ‘ high risk’ investment projects which nonetheless may have a strategic importance for the development of the national economy .

"However , some Velcro shareholders do not feel quite so well - disposed to Cripps . A minority group led by Alan Kahn ( right ) , president of Kahn Brothers , a New York broking house , rebelled against the Velcro board late last year . Kahn reckoned that a plan either to make them sell their shares or to force a swap of the shares for shares in a newly - formed corporation called Velcro Reorganisation NV was ‘ in effect Hobson 's choice,’ as he put it in an affidavit filed with a New York Federal district court . In his affidavit , dated 27 September , Kahn alleges that ‘ remaining Velcro minority shareholders will be faced with the unpleasant choice of receiving either a grossly unfair cashout price of $ 21.75 per share based upon artificially depressed market prices , or equity in VRNV , a company which will not be traded on NASDAQ or any other stock exchange requiring the necessity for public filings and resulting in an illiquid market’ .

"The animals need foddering , so out you have to go , whether or not there 's a storm brewing .

Nowadays I consider that winter comes too early in Baldersdale and stays too long . The last really bad one was in 1978 when the electricity was off for four days .",1
"Does it indicate that the meaning of an idiom can not be inferred from ( or , more precisely , can not be accounted for as a compositional function of ) the meanings the parts carry IN THAT EXPRESSION ? Clearly not — so it must be a matter of their meanings in other expressions . But equally clearly , these ‘ other expressions’ must be chosen with care : in considering to pull someone 's leg , for instance , there is little point in referring to pull in to pull a fast one , or leg in He has n't a leg to stand on . The definition must be understood as stating that an idiom is an expression whose meaning can not be accounted for as a compositional function of the meanings its parts have when they are not parts of idioms . The circularity is now plain : to apply the definition , we must already be in a position to distinguish idiomatic from non - idiomatic expressions .",0
"For instance , if good supportive accommodation and a job with a sympathetic employer could be found , this would immediately reduce the potential range of home and work - related events . Moreover , it might be possible to resolve some of the difficulties that might arise before , say , eviction or redundancy became real possibilities . Many , if not most , events implicated in depression do not occur out of the blue . While this may not mean they are preventable , there is at least the possibility of fortifying the individual against their effects .

"And a British teacher I knew used to point out to me the oddness of Chinese children 's drawing styles compared with those of Western children . While Western infants are quite happy to draw in ways that are characteristically ‘ childish’ Chinese children rule careful lines and get quite frustrated in their attempts to produce pictures that do not look childish . Chinese parents do , of course , shower love and attention on their children but it is always made quite clear that child 's - play has to remain well within the limits of normal social behaviour . The same control applies to adults in their treatment of children . You hardly ever see a parent hit a child .",1

"Without this revival before 1914 it is difficult to see how the parry could have survived the ten turbulent years that followed . By 1914 Unionists again really believed in their cause , as few had done in 1911 . By 1914 the Liberal party was on the ropes and the Unionists could look forward confidently to the election that could not be long delayed . Debate has been fierce between Liberal and Labour historians as to what can be proved from the by - elections of 1911–14 about the relative strength of the two Progressive parties ; it is an indecisive argument in its very nature because of the confused pattern of results and the lack of any truly comparable figures for 1910 or 1906 . What can not be doubted is that Unionists , who had drawn level with the Liberals in 1910 , had made up more ground on them since .",0

"That is , in periods of high unemployment , the government would expand aggregate demand : this would reduce the unemployment but at the same time tend to create inflationary pressure so that eventually the government would have to reduce aggregate demand again . Thus , all ' go ' periods tended to be followed by ' stop'periods and it became difficult to achieve long - term economic growth . Possibly the main problem is that the Keynesian model is only short - term and in the short - run , it is not always easy to predict the effects of policy changes , and the management of the economy , therefore , may become very erratic . A second limitation of the Keynesian model as we have outlined it in this chapter is that it fails to take adequately into account the problem of inflation . Indeed , the basic model assumes that wages and prices are fixed and the only time we allowed them to rise was after the attainment of full employment .",0
"Shortly after reading that I was fascinated to come across Hugh Seton - Watson 's account , in a book written 44 years ago , of how in Eastern Europe between the wars the word ‘ Communist’ had become popular with the poor subjects of largely dictatorial regimes because their rulers used it as a term of abuse against ‘ ordinary men and women who have asked for reforms , protested against bureaucratic abuse , or resisted the gendarmerie in the execution of some wanton brutality.’ I 'm not sure whether 40 years later , the same mechanism made the word ‘ capitalism’ popular among the people ; the Leipzig demonstrations suggest that in Saxony , at least , it may have done . WHAT I do know is that people like Havel have been getting a little impatient with those relishing pieces appearing lately in the American press that say , roughly : ‘ Right , you guys over there have had your romantic Ruritanian fun and games with revolution and dancing in the streets . Now get down to the business of making a country fit for business to operate in , with plenty of unemployment and real inequality.’ Exchanging one kind of social and economic brutalism for another is not what Havel and his kind have in mind , nor do such prescriptions fit the democratic habit of the Czech temperament , formed long before communism 's arrival to power .",0

"The proximate cause of the decline in births was the adoption of contraceptive practices by the majority of married women and to a lesser extent ( illegal ) abortion . This is amply confirmed by analysis of the 1911 census ( Matras 1965 ) , by the enquiries on contraception begun by Dr. E. Lewis - Faning in connection with the 1946 Family Census ( Lewis - Faning 1949 , Glass and Grebenik 1954 ) , and by all other surveys since , as well as by contemporary accounts ( Fryer 1965 ) . But families do not just decide , for the first time in history , to adopt contraception out of the blue .

"Growth and other manoeuvrings motivated by no logic other than a defensive one are economically damaging by - products of an active market for control , causing a ‘ huge diversion of managerial effort into devising ways to reduce a vulnerability that did not grow out of managerial inefficiency’ . The side - effect that has caused greatest concern in recent years , however , is that of ‘ short- termism’ . This is a condition in which managements become excessively concerned with short - term profits with a view to keeping share price high and thus avoiding the attention of bidders . In order to boost short - term accounting profits companies may be tempted to cut expenditure on items such as training , research and development , and investment in productive capacity , all of which are essential to a healthy economy , on the basis that they will show a positive return only in the longer term . This tendency is said to be exacerbated by the growth of institutional holdings , the institutions themselves exhibiting a short - termist attitude , conspicuous in the fund managers engaged by them .",0

Many children are not helped . ‘ Do n't be silly’ , ‘ do n't make such a fuss’ , are the messages from parents who do n't appreciate the intensity of children 's grief .",0
"What I was erm doing was trying to identify the three er characteristics of the er Maoist Communist Party as it emerged towards the end of the nineteen thirties which really disqualifies it , I think , from the label Marxist , means that it 's a completely different type of organization to what the Chinese Communist Party had been in the nineteen twenties . I talked about the leadership being essentially a leadership of modernizing nationalist intellectuals . The rank and file , by contrast , is composed of peasants , a mass membership is composed of peasants . Primarily peasant guerilla fighters , people who were fighting in the Red Army , and it draws its mass support , the Party members draw their mass support , er from the peasants in the areas where they establish their authority . And this rank and file membership and the wider group of supporters are subject to leadership from above , there is no real inner party democracy in the Maoist Communist Party .",0
"Despite their astounding obedience at the start of their story , they belong to the old order , and betray its features : deceit , fear , including fear of God , selfishness , thoughtlessness , recklessness , cruelty and shocking disbelief . This is all too familiar . If God is truly to begin again , then he must start with a child born out of the blue , a child most decidedly of his making . With Isaac there is a possibility of a new order being established . With Isaac God can look forward to a world over which he can again clap his hands in delight .",0

"It raised input costs , thereby tending to reduce profitability and intensifying the pressure on industry to raise prices ( much fixed capital could no longer be operated profitably at existing output prices ) . It also transferred , at a stroke , 1½ per cent of world purchasing power to OPEC . The recipients did not , and in the short run simply could not , spend the majority of their extra revenue . So world demand fell . These pressures were intensified by the introduction of yet more restrictive policies : monetary conditions were further tightened in most economies in the spring of 1974 .",0
"This rally was addressed by Gerry Fitt , Betty Sinclair , Roddy Connolly , Sean Nolan of the Irish Workers ' Party ( the name of the Communist Party in the south ) , and three of the Young Turks from the Derry Labour and republican left . Janet Willcock called for the unity of all radical opinion in Derry ; Eamonn McCann said that Terence O'Neill could not be distinguished from Lord Brookeborough and that reference to liberal unionism was double talk . The recently formed Council of Labour should summon a rank - and - file conference of all the radical political movements in Ireland and call on them to discuss the creation of an all - Ireland socialist party . In Derry they should take their politics out on to the streets and he urged an extension of direct action .

When Auntie Jean slammed Uncle Ted 's tea on the table at the end of each day — a meat pie and chips , or a nice bit of rump steak and tartar sauce ( he had n't the nerve yet to go vegetarian ) — she sat opposite him with a stiff drink and demanded facts about Eva and Dad .

"In Minton 's paintings , Greaves recalled , there were always sudden flashes of green and mauve even in the corners of this burnt - umber coloured room . Ruskin Spear , on the other hand , thought Minton 's decision to paint in the life room a mistake . Though Minton did not begin until the class was all set up and working , the forcefulness of his example meant that at the end of the day there were eight Mintons instead of one . Minton himself saw what was happening and abandoned this practice around 1951 — 2 . Thereafter the difference between his life class and that run by Ruskin Spear was that in Spear 's the students painted naked ladies , in Minton 's , naked men .",0

She was not feeling in her sunniest humour as she wondered if she was going to have to wait all day tomorrow for her summons , when someone rang her doorbell . On answering it , with a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach , she realised she was n't going to have to wait until tomorrow to receive her marching orders . Though , to start with , her initial feeling was one of total shock as she pulled back her door and saw Naylor Massingham standing there . Indeed , so shaken was she that , without being fully aware of what she was doing , she had invited him in and had led the way into her sitting - room before she had got herself back together again .",0
"‘ Put them back,’ she instructed in a cool , disapproving voice . He did , smirking as he closed the drawer again .

"Subject Area : Socio - legal studies Research summary : The study built on the tradition of ethnographic studies of the occupational culture and routine decisions and conduct of rank - and - file police officers , and extended the cumulative knowledge by exploring the case of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland . This afforded the opportunity to examine , for the first time , the accomplishment of ‘ normal policing’ in a divided society . The research showed that while there is a great similarity in routine policing in Northern Ireland and more socially integrated societies , despite the common sense image of policing in the province , routine policing is affected by Northern Ireland 's social and communal division .",0

"His Word , in Greek , his Logos , is not only personal address , but also his own divine intelligibility . This does not mean that that intelligibility can be wholly captured in the formulations or in the mind of the theologian ; it does , however , mean that the divine intelligibility comes across to us , that God gives himself to be known and understood , and that the understanding that is made possible in theology is and is intended to be a genuine understanding and an authentic contact with the intelligibility of God . The Word was made flesh in Jesus Christ ; God has given himself to be understood in our terms and on our level ; and even in these terms and on that level it is the reality of God that is given for us to understand . This carried Barth decisively away from Dialectical Theology , and especially from Bultmann . Bultmann too was happy to describe theology as ' faith seeking understanding ' ; but what he meant by this was faith 's self -understanding , an understanding having to do with self - awareness and self - knowledge , subjective rather than objective .",1
"In the meantime V will fall . Monetarists also recognize that the demand for money can shift unpredictably in the short run with changing expectations of prices , interest rates and exchange rates . Thus V is unpredictable in the short run , and hence the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand is also unpredictable in the short run . For these reasons monetarists argue that monetary policy can not be used for short - run demand management . Here at least , then , there is a measure of agreement between Keynesians and monetarists .",0

"Shinwell , always a better politician than administrator , was widely felt to be doing a poor job in this crucial economic ministry . Thus , shortly after the Electricity Act received the royal assent , in September 1947 , Attlee appointed Gaitskell as Minister in his place , and it therefore fell to him to carry through the Government 's work of nationalisation by completing the appointments to the Boards and the working out of the new relationship of Ministry and BEA . Some years later both Shinwell and Reuben Kelf - Cohen ( the civil servant who then headed the Electricity and Gas Division in the Ministry of Fuel and Power ) suggested that the Labour Government 's nationalisation plans had generally been ill - prepared , but in retrospect their complaints of the absence of nationalisation ‘ blue - prints’ seem wide of the mark , at least in the case of electricity . For more than a decade there had been detailed debate in the industry on the best form of securing greater coordination of distribution . Several wartime reconstruction working parties in the Ministry had outlined plans for reorganisation very similar to those adopted by the Labour Government .",0

On returning from Prague , Mozart had completed his last instrumental piece , the exquisitely melancholy Clarinet Concerto ( originally written for basset - horn ) , for his friend Anton Stadler , and in early November he wrote a short cantata , Kleine Freimaurer - Kantate , K.623 , for a Masonic meeting . But his main preoccupation was with the unfinished Requiem , which had begun to prey on his mind . According to a posthumous account of Mozart 's last months , he and Constanze drove out to the Prater one fine day at the end of October , during which Mozart told his wife that he was convinced he was writing his own Requiem . It seems to have been about then that he mentioned for the first time that he thought he was being poisoned with acqua toffana ( a notorious Italian poison ) .",0

"The Poles bore the massive burden of state subsidies and international debt repayments first to create Gdynia and then to run it at rates that would undercut the Danzig trade . The whole Gdynia venture was only possible because of massive government preference , and there is little doubt that the port could not have been run indefinitely at such favourable rates . However , in the short run , Gdynia was more than capable of causing the Danzigers severe economic distress and genuine hardship . As the Danzigers saw it , Gdynia was just a very expensive way of ruining them ; it proved just how hard - hearted and merciless the Poles could be , and that feeling helped to foster the growth of the Nazi Party in the Free City . If the economic situation of Danzig was complex and in decline , then the ethnic and linguistic changes in the city reflected these alterations .",0

"John the Baptist 's ritual at the Jordan would certainly seem to have entailed something of the sort . It appears to have been roughly analogous to , say , the investiture of the Prince of Wales . Having been baptised by John , Jesus had the ‘ seal of approval’ of an accepted and established prophet , a revered holy man — just as Saul , the first King of Israel , received a ‘ seal of approval’from the prophet Samuel . If John had been of the same family as Jesus , moreover , his ‘ seal of approval’ would have carried the additional authority of a royal warrant . One thing , at any rate , would seem to be clear , and this is that Jesus , after his baptism in the Jordan , undergoes a significant change .",0

"Not only that perhaps — I must be careful not to make everything seem too connected — but social and literary life was metamorphosing .

He seemed more likely to blow a kiss than to throw a punch ; to be at a dinner - table than to be down in the dives ; to be rubbing shoulders than to be shoving or sticking it to the comfortable ( I almost said to the bourgeoisie . ) By now , the essential bloodline of the new novel has been tolerably well - advertised , and it shows Mailer back on combative form . ‘ Harlot’ is Hugh Montague , an intellectual spook who is obviously indebted as a character to James Jesus Angleton .",0
This leaves a handsome £ 30 for the distributor and designer to share . Nintendo and Sega can control prices by insisting all software companies buy their cartridges from them . It aims to keep things that way by launching a High Court copyright action against British software designer Codemasters which is about to launch its games on the market . They can be used on Sega hardware but are half the price . Codemasters ' director David Darling said : ‘ The fact that Sega has chosen to wait to sue until just before our commercial launch shows this is a blatant attempt to keep us from the market they control.’,1

Outright sedition is , however , a pretty remote outcome .

Although this alliance may not last for long , both sides have an interest in sticking together while negotiations continue . The Volksfront is vague on whether ' self - determination ' means fully fledged nationhood , or whether regional autonomy would do .",0

"Many of the bird species in this region are threatened with extinction , notably from the loss of their forest habitats , hunting , and the introduction of alien predators such as rats , cats , stoats and mongoose . Among those in imminent danger are the silktail and Ponape mountain starling , the San Cristobal mountain rail , and the Marquesas and Society Island pigeons . The conservation strategy will focus initially on building up an information database on the region 's bird life , and on conducting further surveys , with a view to making information available to locally - based researchers . It will also seek to reverse deforestation in Papua New Guinea , Vanuatu , Fiji , New Caledonia and the Solomons .

"Obviously I enjoyed having the opportunity to watch any nesting birds so close at hand — I could reach out of my bedroom window , when Mum was n't around , and feel right inside the nest — but many of the neighbours looked on the house martins as pests who infested their property and made a mess . Even my father was n't too pleased about continually having to clean his porch roof , which our residents had covered in droppings and other nest debris . Eventually he decided to give them their marching orders , and one spring , just before the birds were due to arrive , he nailed wire netting and a large dustbin bag along the eaves to stop them building their nests in the usual place . This did the trick , of course , but the birds simply moved in next door , which did n't make the neighbours too happy . I was sad to see the martins go , even though they had often been very noisy at night and kept me awake .",0

"Ninety - eight per cent of all criminal cases are heard in the latter courts . It was upon them that the legal profession focussed in the early 1970s in an attempt to improve its tarnished public image .

"The sample was drawn from carers providing substantial amounts of help to a disabled adult living in the same household , excluding spouse carers and caring arising from a son or daughter born disabled . Although the overall picture which emerges in this essentially exploratory study will not feel new to Social Services practitioners — that is , that the financial costs of caring are considerable even in the better off three - adult households , and the majority of two - adult households are living in poverty — the detail of the data adds both emphasis and new angles . For example , evidence of the implications of directly providing , or retaining responsibility for round the clock care , hammers home the reality of the phrase ‘ needing a break’ ; evidence that it is not so much low income which is costly for the carer but the precariousness of a present and a future which depends , at least in part . on income belonging to the disabled person , provides a new angle . Glendinning sets her analysis into the context of wider socio - economic and demographic trends , concluding that the central issue for policy makers is the provision of an independent income for carers .",0

"If the smaller firms continue to bow out of training chartered accountants , the number of trainees will be concentrated among fewer and fewer larger organisations .

"I even considered swooning so as to get out of the room when suddenly a secret door just behind the throne was thrown open and the most incredible sight emerged : a man , black as night , well over two yards high .

He wore white , baggy trousers which billowed like silken sails and red , high - heeled , velvet slippers with ornately curled toes . Dacourt stopped speaking and gaped like a carp . The big , black mameluke was an eye - catching sight but the beasts which went before him on silver chains were really alarming .",1

"A reduction in the deficit today might lead in the short run to a fall in GDP that is larger than the cut in the deficit ( if the so - called multiplier is larger than one ) , which would cause the debt / GDP ratio to rise . But almost all economic models imply that a cut in expenditures today should lead to higher GDP in the long run , because it allows for lower taxes ( and thus reduces economic distortions ) . Austerity should thus always be beneficial for solvency in the long run , even if the debt / GDP ratio deteriorates in the short run .  ",0
A classic restoration I WONDER how many Ipswich pensioners remember seeing this gleaming limousine gliding through the streets of Ipswich ?

"Turning to special forms of the savings function , we can see that the effect is straightforward in the case of the extreme classical savings function ( with no saving out of wages ) . When the capital stock has adjusted to its new steady - state level , the rise in the gross rate of return is just enough to offset the tax , and it is the wage rate that is reduced . This provides a striking example of how the long - run incidence may differ from that in the short - run . There is therefore a considerable degree of shifting . Exercise 8–1 .",0

Cranes of the size required to handle the new prototype Fast Afloat Boat were few and far between — and even more expensive to hire .

"Novelty often provides good motivation . Behind the active partners , there is the organisation — the firm or institution — and the dependency of the partnership on broader considerations in the parent body . In partnerships at levels one and two , the parent body may pull the plug or change the terms of reference because the partnership activity is not essential to the main business of the company . But in level three partnerships , the identity of interest is within the core business — or vision perspective — of the partners and withdrawal would involve a diminution of activity in the life - sustaining activity of all the partners . That is why the new partnerships can only be understood in terms of the contemporary concepts of organisational mission and vision .",0

"In his report on the service the divisional inspector for Scotland South , Tony Course , observed : ‘ the crews’ response was in the highest tradition of lifeboat service . All knew that they would have to pass through what has been described as a maelstrom , and that they would have to rely on the seamanship of their coxswain to reach the relative safety of open water ; there would be no second chance in conditions which were described as the worst in living memory.’ The lifeboat was struck by a large sea as she was leaving the harbour and Coxswain Wight had difficulty in manoeuvring clear of the narrow channel , before pausing to take stock of the conditions at sea and pressing on to clear off - lying rocks . Coxswain Wight had to head offshore for nearly three miles in a north - easterly direction before he could turn the lifeboat down - weather to the south - east on a course for St Abbs head .

The presence of earthworms and deep , strong grass roots are very good signs ; shallow , matted roots , a hard ‘ pan’ near the surface , rushes , and surface water indicate a soil in poor structural condition . Having gained a clear first impression , the next step , before taking the plunge , is to learn much more about the soil itself and the history of the farm .

If it is , soil maps can be obtained from the London Map Centre or Sanfords and possibly a detailed ‘ narrative’ of the various soil types , their qualities , and their shortcomings .",0

"This narrative – the standard Keynesian line , modified for a debt crisis – is the one to which most government officials , central bankers , and Wall ~ Street economists have subscribed , and needs little elaboration . Its virtue is that it gives policymakers something clear to do , with promised returns that match the political cycle . Unfortunately , despite past stimulus , growth is still tepid , and it is increasingly difficult to find sensible new spending that can pay off in the short run . Attention is therefore shifting to the second narrative , which suggests that the advanced economies ’ fundamental capacity to grow by making useful things has been declining for decades , a trend that was masked by debt - fueled spending . More such spending will not return these countries to a sustainable growth path .",0

After the interval , chances were few and far between and most of the early play took place in mid - field , but towards the end Hucklecote applied severe pressure , but the visitor 's defence superbly mastered by outside half , Neil Smith held out for a fine hard - earned victory .

"At this point , a eurozone recession is certain .

It must also contend with significant fiscal drag , ongoing deleveraging in the household sector ( amid weak job creation , stagnant incomes , and persistent downward pressure on real estate and financial wealth ) , rising inequality , and political gridlock .

"The first , better - known diagnosis is that demand has collapsed because of high debt accumulated prior to the crisis . Households ( and countries ) that were most prone to spend can not borrow any more .

However , the fact that men did sing soprano seriously at this time , in combination with the text of this récit which on the surface is not ridiculous , although it certainly could be performed tongue - in - cheek opens the door to doubts about the style of performance the role demands . It is possible to conceive of at least two different interpretations of this role , one in which Hymen 's idealization of the pastoral world is undermined only by subsequent events , the other in which the ridiculousness of his words becomes apparent immediately .

"Cut off from his inspiration , he endlessly rehashes songs from his American era . On the other hand , he at last gains well - deserved riches and a life of comfort . Just as I was about to pick up the pieces of card once more , I stopped transfixed . A glorious Irish voice rang out in song , a manly tenor that equalled the most impassioned of blues . I ran across the road to the open door of another tiny studio , and saw a grizzle - bearded hobo - like man singing into a microphone , his mouth wide open and his eyes half closed .",1
"The decision to return to the gold standard , and to operate it , often necessitated the rise of interest rates which acted as a burden upon the exporting industries just as the reflation of the pound had made exporting more difficult . By the end of 1926 , the General Council was advancing the argument , with some justification , that the General Strike had only been an attempt to warn employers that the problems of industry could not constantly be tackled at the expense of the standard of living of the workers . Such a view helped trade union leaders to think in terms of coming to some type of arrangement with industrialists who were feeling the pinch of economic policy . George Hicks was well attuned to this possible linkage when , in his presidential address to the 1927 Trade Union Congress , he asserted : …",0
"At present teacher training is urban orientated . The few experiences of community education , linking formal with non - formal methods such as the bi - lingual education in Scotland , have only begun to demonstrate the validity of a community orientated approach to learning . Such experiences are too few and far between , and in too early a stage of development to demonstrate their effectiveness . Any change in formal education is likely to be a slow process of adaptation to changing circumstances , rather than a rapid shift of course . Recognising the constraints , it is still important for institutions involved in training personnel who will have an educational role in rural areas to emphasise the potential which the rural environment has in educational terms and to understand the social and cultural characteristics of such an environment .",0

"But such a stance dooms prospects for a new global treaty , as developed countries will rightly insist that poorer countries be part of the solution . The consequences of failure in Copenhagen could be considerable . In the short run , we may well see climate - related concerns become the newest excuse for increased trade protectionism . So - called "" carbon tariffs "" are likely to be introduced to penalize imports from countries or companies deemed not to be doing enough to curb emissions . World trade is already down sharply as a result of the economic crisis ; introducing new tariffs would inevitably reduce trade further , causing the loss of additional jobs and leading to new frictions .",0
"Brigade command headquarters were also established in the buildings , which were systematically wrecked by the former Yugoslav army . They are also thought to have installed deadly boobytraps before leaving the region where the 100strong Cheshire contingent will soon be joined by a further 2,300 soldiers from the regiment . Men from the Royal Engineers and local contractors have been working around the clock to make the barracks habitable .

"From April it will be housed in a permanent gallery created from the coach house at the Ranger 's House , Blackheath , one of English Heritage 's finest London houses , which already holds collections of musical instruments and Jacobean pictures . The coach house has been converted at a reasonable sum drawn from the annual budget . The collection continues to expand , mostly by donation but a very small purchase grant enables Mr Rosoman to pick up the occasional piece at auction : he recently purchased some papier mache moulds at the Christie 's Crowther sale . The key point about all the objects collected is that their provenance is known ; they are not collected for aesthetic merit alone . Professional architects , town planners and students have made use of the collection over the years , but the new display will be used for a much wider educational programme for primary and secondary schools .",1
"( Active sportsmen — and active bandsmen ' too , for the companies encouraged the colliery bands — were felt to be less likely to engage in ' subversive ' union and other activity , and inter - village rivalries were encouraged : Waller , 1983 , p. 197 , p. 208 . ) Alongside the positive aspects of the social control of the villages were the negative . The villages were patrolled by company uniformed ' policemen ' whose ' duties were primarily concerned with the maintenance of the appearance of the village , keeping the lawns tidy and litter off the streets , for example'(Waller , 1983 , p. 98 ) , but Waller 's respondents also reported company ' policemen'who watched over children 's play , recorded untidy properties ( ' It seems clear that the threat of dismissal was thought to hang over men who did not keep their gardens tidy in several villages ' — p. 100 ) , and ensured that dogs were not kept as pets ( thus preventing the men from engaging in the popular contemporary sport among miners of training and racing greyhounds and whippets ) . To one resident , at least , the atmosphere was that of a ' prison camp'(p . 103 ) , and this was enhanced by the fear of eviction if the miner lost his job . The colliery villages were clearly places in which control of the workforce was strong , beyond the normal social relationships between employers and employee which were established at the pit itself .",1

"Perhaps my most memorable day occurred with Paul on our ascent of Kichik Kumdan .

"Behind a veil of revolutionary rhetoric , the Council of People 's Commissars suppressed the masses ' striving for liberty . Instead of relying upon the workers ' militia and the election of officers , Trotsky and his acolytes created a Red Army modelled on thoroughly traditional lines . In place of the major role which workers were demanding in running the factories , Lenin presided over the centralization of economic power and the establishment of managerial structures divorced from the rank and file . Instead of fostering the peasants ' bid for liberty , the commissars emasculated local peasants organizations and , by forcibly requisitioning grain , did all they could to subject the peasantry to the dictates of the State . It was not only the press and organizations of the Right and of moderate socialist parties which were repressed : the anarchists , too , were ruthlessly hounded by the Cheka .",0

"It arose out of genuine social issues , not because there was a disproportionate number of prejudiced personalities living in the locality . The threat to the breakdown of law and order , which led to the passing of the Public Order Act in 1936 , was more complex than the simplified picture of a battle between fascists and communists for control of the streets which both the BUF press and the Metropolitan Police records tend to convey . On both sides it was the rank and file members of the fascists , and the communists and the Jewish community , who demanded more vigorous action . Initially the fascists tried to present a respectable form of anti - semitism for the campaign in the East End . However , the success of Houston and the failure of Wegg Prosser , coupled with the emergence of East End populist orators like E.G. ‘ Mick’ Clarke , combined with increased hostility by militant working - class and Jewish elements to bring about a rapid reversal of policy .",0
"The Smiths , Vanns and Wards each had six branches , the Johnsons five , the Langtons , Holmeses , Noones and Abbotts four and several others had three . Kinship links through frequent intermarriage and numerous personal friendships cemented the bonds that gave Wigston and similar places a real sense of belonging to a community . The old agrarian basis of the economy survived well into the Georgian era but the enormous growth of population made a new form of local society unavoidable and the Enclosure Award of 1766 put the final seal of approval on changes that had long been underway . Prior to these changes , Wigston was typical of many Tudor and Stuart parishes where smallholders managed to hang on to their property for generation after generation . A few rich families began to emerge at the top of such societies and the numbers of poor cottagers grew significantly , but the old - established middling families long remained the backbone of many a rural community .",0

"If that is what it turned out to be , it is certainly not what those most concerned to secure or prevent the passage of the Bill thought at the time . The Tories saw it as a constitutional disaster without parallel , the Whigs as a famous and hard - won victory for a bold and far - reaching measure against the reactionary defence of an out - dated and corrupt constitution . That Peel , leading the Tory opposition , recognised that the Whigs ' Bill would in the short run unite the middle and lower classes in support of the Government is one thing ; to infer from this that Grey and his team deliberately set out both to counter the threat of revolution and to do so in a way which would ultimately isolate the working class , quite another . The better view is that the Whigs were for Reform with various degrees of conviction and for a variety of reasons , ranging from that political expediency which saw in it a cause which would get and keep the Tories out , to that of moral principle . When Lord John Russell declared that ‘ the whisper of a faction could not prevail over the voice of a nation’ , he was appealing to moral principle ; and if , when that appeal was made , it chimed in with political expediency it was only because factious and sometimes unprincipled Tory opposition had made it to do so .",0
"Responding to the Handsworth events Douglas Hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place : ‘ The sound which law abiding people in Handsworth heard on Monday night , the echoes of which I picked up on Tuesday , was not a cry for help but a cry for loot’(Financial Times , 13 September 1985 ) . The Chief Constable for the West Midlands , Geoffrey Dear , took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place , with the support of local community leaders . He drew the conclusion from this that the riot ‘ came like a bolt out of the blue’(Guardian , 21 November 1985 ) . Such language focused attention on the individuals or groups who were ‘ breaking the law’ , ‘ committing criminal acts’ , and threatening the interests of the law - abiding ‘ majority’ .

"A third is the defence of public services more generally . A trade unionism that is paralysed by an obsession with parliamentary lobbying and television training for general secretaries can scarcely expect to win the wholehearted support even of its own members , let alone women engaged in domestic labour , part - time workers or the unemployed . The ‘ gulf … between the formal structures and machinery of government of the unions and the rank - and - file membership’ , combined with traditional union hostility towards what it sees as parallel organisation , is a major cause of the current crisis of trade unionism in particular and the predicament of the working class more generally . The miners ' strike revealed the range of new movements and organisations which have been arenas , if complex and contradictory , for the development of working - class culture and working - class consciousness , promising to broaden traditional conceptions of the composition and objectives of the labour movement yet also portraying the unions ' capacity to ignore that potential when it stepped beyond the domestic and controllable to stake its own claims for recognition . For working - class people , the crisis — economic , political or cultural — is being experienced above all at the local level yet is the outcome of unprecedentedly global forces .",0

Groups with a relatively small potential membership , or where some members can bear the costs of organization better than others , are highly mobilized .

Porter lists ten factors , including learning , economies of scale , interrelationships with suppliers , and discretionary policies , that should be examined with a view to reducing costs . In contrast , Kaplan , in developing activity - based costing , is more concerned with an accurate measurement of current product costs and product profitability .

In the words of Roger of Howden,""the young King , of his own accord and under no compulsion , laying his hands on the Holy Gospels in the presence of a large crowd of clerks and laymen , swore that from that day onward and for the rest of his life he would be loyal to King Henry , his father and his lord , and would serve him faithfully . Moreover since he did not wish to have preying on his mind any malice or grudge by reason of which his father might later be offended , he revealed that he had pledged himself to support the barons of Aquitaine against his brother Richard and said that he had done this because Richard had fortified the castle of Clairvaux though it really belonged to the Angevin patrimony which he should inherit from his father . "" The dispute over Clairvaux was easily solved . Grudgingly but fairly quickly Richard was induced to hand the castle over to his father .",0
"  As I looked at the driver , I noticed for the first time that he wore no uniform and was not a postilion ; he seemed to be growing restless , turning his head and looking behind him several times .

"Next time you develop an ache , lump , pain , or tenderness in part of your body , see whether you can find the same thing on the other side .

Nine times out of ten , using this tactic , you discover that there 's nothing to worry about .

The only tricky areas are , of course , anything amiss dead centre — or , of course , anything wrong with the brain .",0

"Yet this life of contributing to the progress towards knowledge of reality is rational , is a — perhaps the — form of human flourishing . The conflicts and inconsistencies present in our commonsense and other mere primitive concepts of inquiry are resolved in a procedure which exhibited a harmony between presumption , aim , and method ; it can be pursued in a totally self - conscious , reflective , self - controlled and rational fashion . If we accept Peirce 's characterization of science , we must acknowledge a discontinuity between ordinary commonsense procedures of inquiry , which all settle belief in the short run , and the life of science , although , of course , the latter may affect the former . The inquirer is distanced from current results , and sees himself , not as finding things out but as contributing to the cognitive progress of a wider community . The tasks of Peirce 's philosophical epistemology become clearer now .",0
"It called for "" communists , party organizations and their committees "" to decide .

However , at a session of the Komsomol 's 21st congress on April 16 CPSU central committee ideology secretary Vadim Medvedev read out a central committee resolution which called for the expulsion from the CPSU of Democratic Platform leaders , albeit not those rank - and - file communists whom they had "" led astray "" .

Uncoached I was at least able to survive a couple of rounds in the local tournaments ; a stroke of luck at this stage was that I was paired with a newcomer to the Command — a FIt Lt Reep who was in a different league to mine — and we entered for competitions and this raised my game quite a bit . In fact we did very well in doubles .

"As more projects are initiated , they are likely to be less and less profitable , with lower expected yearly returns , and therefore lower MEIs . Second , a rise in the level of investment undertaken is , at least in the short run , likely to raise the supply price ( S ) , which in turn will reduce the MEI . This could follow if the capital goods producing industries faced capacity constraints in their attempt to raise output in the short run . The decision on whether to proceed with an investment project will depend on the relationship between the rate of interest ( r ) and the marginal efficiency of investment ( i ) .

"Ornstein is rightly scathing about many of the spiritual nostrums on offer in America from the Marin County psychotherapists to ‘ pop yoga’ . ‘ instant yen’ and ‘ the searches for Shamans in the desert’ , but unfortunately he offers his readers no Good Cult Guide and one feels that many of them may continue to go astray .

Although the book as a whole is unsatisfactory , Ornstein does have some sensible things to say .

"But where such mutuality is non - existent ; where through some personal need ( based in earlier life and relationships ) the woman finds her greatest satisfactions in motherhood rather than in marriage ; where male inadequacy sees neglect in anything but total attention ; or where circumstances exist in which addition to the family unduly diminishes the expression of sexual love between two partners : personal and sexual dissonance is likely to arise , which will lead to further marital rifts , which will themselves militate against sexual happiness … and so on in a vicious spiral . Ideally , pre - marital counselling , supplemented before parenthood , would meet problems before they could arise . Counselling is seldom provided in such matters : the social worker is often left to pick up the pieces . Problems which may arise in any family are those which may be seen as related to the Oedipal situation — the sexual attachment which arises between parent and child and which is not always worked through adequately .

"He was very mysterious … and rather ridiculous.’ Melissa smiled faintly at the recollection . ‘ He said , if I remember correctly , something like , ‘ We have n't heard the last of this’ while beating his nose black and blue with his Biro.’ ‘ Whatever could he have meant by that?’ ‘ At the time , he thought — no , it was almost as if he was hoping — that someone had pushed Klein off the cliff .",0
"Broomhead shifted his position on the cart and urged his horse on once more to no effect . They had just turned into Bacon Street when he heard a loud voice calling to him and pulled sharply on the reins . The tired horse stopped dead in its tracks and turned its head around to give him a baleful stare . Broomhead looked up in the direction of the shouting and saw a woman leaning out of a window on the top floor of Bacon Buildings . ‘ Yer'll ' ave ter come down , missus,’ he called out to her , ‘ I ca n't climb those stairs wiv me bad leg.’",1
"Wheelchairs are easy to tip over backwards so a recommended maximum slope for ramps is an inch in height gained per foot of incline . I need to be able to see the path ahead in order to plan my route well in advance , or else I may get myself into an awkward position . In these cases I either have to wait for a passing walker and ask for assistance , try to reverse my direction or take the plunge and risk damage to chair and body . With laid surfaces such as tarmac , another hazard is the camber — the slight upward curve to the centre of the surface of a road or track . This can be steep , making progress forward difficult — you have to hold one wheel and push hard on the other just to stop yourself from rolling down it .",0
"The evidence of labour supply responses to tax cuts is that they are undramatic ( see chapter 12 ) . If they are to occur , it is likely to be in the long run when economic actors can adjust to the new situation . In the short run it is generally argued that tax cuts will simply stimulate aggregate demand and , with aggregate supply largely unaffected , will be inflationary . Such a consideration raises the prospect of having to run a surplus budget at the same time as cutting taxes . The difference between the short run and the long run is important for the political business cycle models which are now seen as a more central feature of a public choice perspective .",0
"CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke today waded into a fresh Tory rift over public spending after delivering a broad hint that his November Budget will bring rises in indirect taxes . And the signals suggested Mr Clarke may opt to extend the scope of VAT to newspapers , food , children 's clothing , and could also tinker with tax allowances to pull in extra revenue . Mr Clarke threw down the gauntlet to a trio of Cabinet colleagues in the vanguard of demands for deeper spending cuts instead of higher taxes to tackle the projected £ 50bn deficit . Support His remarks , in a Daily Telegraph interview , triggered protests from right - wing Tory MPs and pitched the Cabinet into more controversy as it met for the first time since the summer break .",0
"From 1982 onwards , Romania 's Western creditors found themselves faced by a baffling response from Bucharest to their offers of further credit . It was unwanted . The Western banks regarded Romania as a good risk : cynically , they judged that Ceauşescu would keep the lid on the pot in Romania in a way that Gierek had manifestly failed to do in Poland . Whatever his faults from the perspective of Amnesty International , those very same blots on his reputation were what made Romania much more credit - worthy than many less brutal regimes . But independence is indivisible , so Ceauşescu thought , he should not have let Romania become dependent on Western credit any more than he had let it fall under Soviet political control .",0

"As a result many would - be house purchasers never qualified for a loan . ‘ Probably the relatively low level of heavy commitment in the case of mortgages’ , stated the Office of Fair Trading report Overindebtedness ( July 1989 ) , ‘ can be attributed to the detailed investigation into incomes and other circumstances which usually precedes the granting of a mortgage.’ Most of those whom the investigations showed to be credit - worthy justified the faith put in them and stayed the course .

The most common debts were rent arrears .",0
"The search techniques to reject sentences need to be highly efficient so that invalid combinations can be quickly rejected . There are points in favour of the rule - based method .

"By that time , however , refrigeration techniques had ensured that meat could be brought from much further afield : beef from North and South America , mutton from Australia and New Zealand . By 1910 the inhabitants of Britain consumed a million tons of meat over and above home produce . Much of the beef from the United States in fact arrived in cattle ships on the hoof . Typical was the American meat traffic to Birkenhead .

"In some set - piece frescoes , life - sized figures of men , bulls , and griffins were moulded in low relief ; this seems to have happened in the period 1550–1470 BC , but not later .

The colours used for fresco painting were for the most part easily obtained : red ochre , yellow ochre , black ( either from charred bone or from carbonaceous shale ) and blue ( from a copper - tinted glass ) . An analysis of the paints used on the Agia Triadha sarcophagus shows that some paints had a more exotic origin : the blue seems to be ground lapis lazuli . Sinclair Hood ( 1971 ) says that some of the fresco subjects were secular , but the evidence points increasingly to a pervasive religious content .",1

"9.9 Light scattering Light scattering is one of the most popular methods for determining the weight average molar mass M w . The phenomenon of light scattering by small particles is familiar to us all ; the blue colour of the sky or the varied colours of a sunset , the poor penetration of car headlights in a fog is caused by water droplets scattering the light , and the obvious presence of dust in a sunbeam or the Tyndall effect in an irradiated colloidal solution are further examples of this effect . The fundamentals of light scattering were expounded by Lord Rayleigh in 1871 during his studies on gases , where the particle is small compared with the wavelength of the incident radiation . Light is an electromagnetic wave , produced by the interaction of a magnetic and electric field , both oscillating at right angles to one another in the direction of propagation .",1

"The dangers of routine and passivity to the often joyful and serene spirit which infused abolitionists grew greater as direct British targets for the cause largely disappeared from the late 1830s onwards .

"In St Augustine 's interpretation of Trinitarian doctrine , Hilton also found a way of showing how sinful man could learn about the incomprehensible God and return to his creator . It explained the shape of the mystical experience that came to him in prayer . Mystical experience never arrives out of the blue ; it is always influenced by the religious milieu of the mystic , even though he may want to transcend the beliefs and attitudes that he found there . St Augustine taught that God had created man in his own image and so it was by looking at his own soul that man would discover God : ‘ May I know myself ! may I know thee!’ he had cried . There was a trinity within everyone , consisting of the three powers of the soul which corresponded to the three divine Persons : memory , understanding and will ; it enabled us to be , to know and to love what we are in the same way as God knows and loves himself .",0

"SHOCK PLAN TO BOLT LAND 'S END NEXT SUMMER In the clearest challenge yet to the British Mountaineering Council 's agreed policy on bolts , the granite cliffs of Land 's End are to be equipped with bolts by a private company , assisted by controversial Cornish climber Rowland Edwards The announcement that some routes in the area , which is visited by over 2,000 climbers a year , are to be equipped for ‘ environmental’ reasons came in a press release that effectively throws down the gauntlet to the sport 's governing body . According to the release from Peter de Savary 's Land 's End Limited , the move was prompted by increasing concern over cliff - top erosion and a growing threat to climbers ' safety due to deteriorating in - situ protection and lack of regulatory control .

"Unlike most of the other 2,000 pension funds then operating in America , the GM fund did not principally invest in the company 's own shares nor limit itself to fixed - income securities . It sought to provide for workers ' retirement by broad , diversified investment in the American economy , that is , in equities . In effect , it chose to pay for workers ' deferred consumption by staking a claim on America 's corporate profits . Once GM 's union agreed to the plan , a bandwagon rolled : within a year 8,000 new plans had been written , all along the same lines . This idea of the diversified , fully funded scheme ( that is , run to match assets with present and future pension liabilities ) has been applied most widely in America and Britain , where its principles have been written into law ; it has also spread into Japan but scarcely at all into Germany , where company pension reserves frequently remain invested in the firm 's own shares .",0

Although at first he had to consolidate his position at home , it was always his ambition to undermine the European order which had come into being after the defeat of his uncle .

"Cynthia Cockburn calls this "" studied hypocrisy "" , arguing that as things stood no woman could expect to earn the same wage as a man , because of the Factory Acts among other things , and links it with the undoubtedly fiercely held view among many compositors that women really had no right to "" leave the home "" anyway . It is possible to nuance this view slightly as regards the Edinburgh union leadership . There may just have been some hope of effecting change through organization , especially when the numbers of women were still low ( about 300 at the end of the 18805 ) , though the means chosen were not welcomed by the rank and file of the men 's union . Although unfortunately details of the projects are tantalizingly hard to ascertain , at least two attempts were made after 1888 by the Edinburgh Typographical Society to set up a women 's union , The first , in the late 1880s , is referred to only in the retrospective "" statement on the Female Question "" , published in 1904 ; Miss Black of London [ who must have been Clementina Black]a lady who was well - known for her efforts to improve the social condition of her sex , offered to make an endeavour to organise the female compositors in Edinburgh , with a view to remedying the evils complained of by the journeymen . The branch committee favourably entertained Miss Black 's assistance , but on it being remitted to a general meeting of the Society , it was rejected on the grounds that if the females were organised , their position would be improved as an industry for females , which would result in great accession to their numbers in the printing trade in Edinburgh .

"They refer on to specialists only a tiny proportion of people with mental disorder , usually those with severely upsetting or difficult problems such as new psychotic illnesses , very severe depression or disabling anxiety disorders . Generally , however , family doctors receive very little training in the management of severe chronic mental disorder in spite of the fact that they may be frequently called on to give advice and may often have to decide when to recommend a period of hospital treatment . GPs also complain , quite rightly , that hospital staff making , for example , discharge plans for a group of patients to a new home or hostel sometimes neglect to discuss the plans with the primary care team — normally the local general practice together with its team of doctors , nurses and other specialists — yet expect the GPs to pick up the pieces when something goes wrong . The reason for this may well be that the hospital consultant is reluctant to let go medical responsibility for former patients and thrust them on to a local GP , but he is not normally easily available when off duty or working in a clinic many miles away . Thus responsibility for the discharged patient often ends up with the GP , whether this outcome is planned or not , and few GPs have been prepared by vocational training for a more involved role in community care services .",0

"While some cooperation and coordination in a specific sector might be possible , as long as the hope was to embrace the whole of Western Europe in its ambit , any scheme could only be minimalist . If the sectoral approach and spillover were to achieve any great potential , they could only do so on a more limited front — that is , by the six states which had already agreed to the supranational principle by forming the ECSC . Yet the Six themselves did not seem prepared to launch any further sectoral integration , at least in the short run . Indeed , the initial experiences of the ECSC had led some to argue that rather than pursue a sector by sector strategy , it would be far easier and more logical to plan for the integration of whole economies . In that sense , the sectoral approach was already being rejected : ECSC might well have been its end rather than its beginning .",0

I think if we are going to go into the next century with any real chance of providing proper education and training in the sixteen to nineteen age range , we need to do the job properly , and frankly I think the offer in Banbury at the moment is not up to scratch . The logical erm conclusion from that was to look at some form of tertiary education and that is what the County Council went out to consultation on . Well do you see this vote against opting out as a basically a vote in favour of the tertiary college plans for Banbury ?",0
"At the end of 1977 , to confirm the Securitate 's control over the pits , the Party secretary in charge of security matters , Vasile Patilineţ , was appointed the new Minister of Mines . Ceauşescu knew Lenin 's dictum , ' trust is good but control is better ' , and ordered the Securitate to send in new informers and to recruit more from among the existing workforce as well . As ever , rank - and - file Party members and local trades union officials provided the core of the listening web which was supposed to embrace all citizens of Romania from cradle to grave . Ion Pacepa has described how scientists working for the Securitate designed a telephone which could be used to bug both phone conversations and any talk in the room where the apparatus was located . How many of these telephones were installed remains unknown , but after the revolution many Romanians who had telephones ( a small minority of the population , of course ) ripped open their own apparatus to find the hidden microphones .",0

"There was little in this performance , with Stephen Kovacevich as soloist , for anyone to recall pleasurably . The exceptional moment when the spirit of Brahms materialised came at the beginning of the andante where Pauline Dowse 's cello solo evoked the inner stillness of the composer — all moonlight , warmth and swaying tree tops . Otherwise , Kovacevich was well wide of the mark and if he respects this work he might contemplate putting it away for a few years before reconsidering its interpretation . Without the distraction of a wayward soloist , Weller came into his own in the glorious fourth symphony of Schumann . This is the peak of German romanticism : less florid than Mendelssohn ; less diversionary than Brahms ; fewer notes than Wagner .",0

"It is worth examining some of this testimony . JESUS AS FREEDOM - FIGHTER Later Christian tradition has emphasised the image of a meek , lamb - like saviour , who eschews violence and bids one turn the other cheek . As we have seen however , the Messiah — for Constantine and the fourth - century Roman Church , as well as for Jesus and his contemporaries — was a very different figure : a stern martial leader and liberator , quite prepared to assert his right by force and , if necessary , to employ violence against his enemies . There is , of course , a solid enough basis for such an image in the Gospels themselves .",0

"‘ There is no doubt about the quality of the coal , but two questions need to be answered — can it be brought out at a price which allows a profit and can the consortium attract the investment required to run the place?’ Although the consortium will not discuss its present financial position , the Bank of Scotland has expressed its concern , in private , to the local enterprise company , Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd. But it is believed that the bank will not pull the plug in haste as its image would take a knock and the money it is owed would be unlikely to be recovered . The Monktonhall miners have secured a number of lucrative deals , including one with ScottishPower which is for five years and believed to be worth £ 10 million . It also has a multi - million pound contract to supply British Coal with up to 90,000 tonnes of domestic coal , but production problems have meant the consortium has fallen well behind with those orders .",0

"Teenagers often make inappropriate responses to conflicts such as aggression , withdrawing , sulking , tantrums or destructive behaviour . Negotiation could sometimes defuse these situations and produce more acceptable consequences for both parties . At a time of crisis when teenagers and their parents ( or brothers and sisters ) are at loggerheads , angry and resentful , contracts provide an opportunity for the family to take stock and to break through vicious circles of retribution and unreason . Although it probably sounds odd that I am suggesting negotiating a written agreement with your teenager , psychologists have been using business - style contracts to resolve family conflicts for some years now . Contracts , it may be thought , are the domain of lawyers or salesmen — far too cold and commercial to apply to human relationships .",0

"However , as the table has to be moved out of the way whenever the patient gets up , it should not be too heavy , or have too many items on it at one time . It is preferable to keep the table clear of objects other than those actually in use , while a sideboard within reach of the patient is used to hold the items which will be needed later . If the patient watches television , it should be positioned so that he is sitting straight to see it : he should not have to turn his head , or bend or crick his neck .

"TELL you what , Test Match Special may have celebrated its being saved for the nation by ditching Don Mosey .

The bad form reached a giggling rock - bottom last year in Sri Lanka 's Test match at Lord 's when the difficulties of both pronunciation and identification proved insurmountable to most in the box .

"Yet Rider Haggard seems to have been dissatisfied with his presentation of the character ( and naturally he must have been influenced , as a professional novelist , by the enormous popularity and sales of She ) and he did not resist the temptation to give his readers a further insight into her . In an Author 's Note to the second book about this strange being , Ayesha , he wrote : Not with a view to conciliating those readers who on principle object to sequels , but as a matter of fact , the Author wishes to say that he does not so regard this book . Rather does he venture to ask that it should be considered as the conclusion of an imaginative tragedy ( if he may so call it ) whereof one half has been already published . The unearthly , mysterious aspect of beauty is emphasised at the end of a book which is in many ways a repetition of its predecessor .",0

He gave no other sign of distress , merely turned his head to greet Miss Mates , saying coolly , ‘ You are prompt , Matey , even without your kitchen help.’ Miss Mates was carrying a black lacquered tray with a delicately flowered china tea - set on it — Wedgwood , Sally - Anne noted — and a silver teapot .

"It 's almost as if some teachers hold the belief that the best parents are those that are docile and ignorant about the school , leaving the professionals to get on with the job . Even the Plowden Report expressed fears of excessive parent power and the possible harmful effects of a strong PTA . Although this potential does exist , actual examples of abuse of parent power through PTAs in the quarter of a century or so since the publication of the report are few and far between . This is not to deny that cliques and ‘ school gate agitators’ sometimes operate with the sole intention of fermenting a campaign aimed at causing damage to the reputation of an individual or the school .

"Shogun , having come off best in a bout of shoving with Day Comet , was making ground up the rails when Reiff moved Craganour over to lean on Aboyeur , causing the outsider to swerve to the left and cut off Shogun 's run on the inside . Again Frank Wootton on Shogun tried to get through , and again Aboyeur cut him off . Now Craganour had gone half a length up , but Aboyeur fought back as Piper sought to straighten him by taking his whip in his left hand and applying it liberally . But this caused Aboyeur to veer away from the rails and collide with Craganour , carrying him out towards the centre of the course and interfering with the finishing runs of Nimbus — who had been far enough back at Tattenham Corner for his jockey to have seen the suffragette incident — and Great Sport , both coming up the stands side . Reiff retaliated by trying to push the favourite back on to Aboyeur , and as the two went past the post Craganour was a head up , with Louvois just behind in third and Great Sport fourth .",1

"The distinctive features of railway activities affect organization and management - workforce relations independently of the fact that in most countries of the world the major railway networks are owned and run by the state , and everywhere without exception they are subject to close state regulation . The nature of railway transport , with heavy trains travelling at speed along fixed tracks between stations and terminals , dictates within broad limits the organization of railway work and creates requirements for specialized control systems . In the words of Dunlop ( 1958 : 20 ) , the technological context of ‘ railroads has many distinctive features affecting the relations of managers and workers : the train operating divisions use small crews working together and in movement far from close and immediate supervision ; complex and expensive equipment is utilized with a high ratio of capital to worker; … the costs of accidents can be consequential ; the hours of operations for equipment may be around the clock , and they do not conform to normal factory schedules … ’ . Similarly , Fontgalland ( 1984 : 131 ) maintains that the ‘ parameters influencing the internal organisation of a railway are continuity of operations ; co - ordination of this with the management of an infrastructure used concurrently to supply two totally independent markets , passengers and goods ; the large number and geographical dispersion of installations ; and individual staff discipline in the matter of safety.’ Thus certain features of railway organization are universal .",0

"Mentally disordered people are still subject to grossly inhuman , degrading or cruel practices , and serious problems have surfaced in large NHS mental hospitals , local authority - run residential homes , small , privately owned hostels and homes and units run by large profit - making corporations . No sector is immune from the problem although , fortunately , the reported scandals do appear to be relatively rare worst cases and are not the tip of some horrendous iceberg . Nevertheless , developing and maintaining standards of high quality practice in mental health services , especially those providing ‘ round the clock’ care in hospitals and residential homes , is an uphill struggle and people who depend on others to provide the basic necessities of life for most of their lives are necessarily vulnerable as they are not in a position to complain effectively , ‘ vote with their feet’or refuse to be consumers of a bad service . Dr Douglas Bennett , a psychiatrist renowned for his commitment to rehabilitation services , remarked that ‘ dust will settle’ in facilities for continuing care unless there is constant vigilance to maintain standards , and I have seen residential homes , established on the surest clinical foundations with excellent staff , deteriorate within a couple of years to become merely average .

"Mastery of the skies over large parts of Germany had already passed to the allies in 1942 , and heavy raids , chiefly by the Royal Air Force , had been carried out on cities mainly in northern and north - western Germany ( Hamburg , Lübeck , Rostock , Cologne , Essen , Bremen , and others ) . Smaller raids which followed on the south - German cities of Munich , Augsburg , and Nuremberg , had a disproportionate psychological effect in demonstrating the extent of allied air supremacy in the capacity to reach so far south , and in illustrating that few could now consider themselves immune from the dangers of bombing . After the directives following the Casablanca Conference of January 1943 had linked the British ‘ area bombing’ by night to the American daytime ‘ precision raids’in a ‘ round - the - clock bombing’strategy , which formed the allied combined - bomber offensive , the raids — described , in this case aptly , by German propaganda as ‘ terror - bombing’— escalated rapidly in extent and ferocity .

"Splitting frequencies — transmitting different programmes on FM and AM — could effectively double listening hours and provides two highly targeted audiences for advertising in a catchment area . In LBC 's case , for example , the LBC Crown FM is going for the upmarket listener , while the medium wave service , London Talkback Radio , is pitching for the tabloid market and the dedicated followers of phone - ins . Capital Radio , the other UK giant of the independents , has already split its frequencies , and before long all nine quoted independent stations are expected do so , albeit not always around the clock .

"In France there had already been speculation , followed by disaster , when John Law persuaded the government to unite all the French colonies into a single vast Company for trading up the Mississippi and in the Indies , which was then used as the base for a wild expansion of the French currency . In the summer of 1720 the South Sea Bubble burst , and the dream that El Dorado might be found in the outside world faded a little further , though the Company went on endeavouring to use its Utrecht trading privileges for another thirty years . Legislation had been passed , at the height of the bubble , to stop the creation of new joint - stock companies , which ruled out one of the ways in which the British had organized their expansion overseas , Walpole , the Prime Minister who picked up the pieces after the collapse , was first of all concerned to make sure that the King and his government did not run into any more trouble , which meant a programme of no new taxes , no wars , no new assertion of authority , and much less expansion than either before or after . This was a sensible policy which would bring stability to Britain , and took it for granted that stability would mean that relations with the colonies would remain unchanged . Neither of the kings whom Walpole served as Prime Minister was firmly seated at the centre of political power in the way their predecessors had been .",0

"Both Edmund Culpeper and the herbalist and astrologer Nicholas Culpeper [ q.v.]were probably poor relations , descended from junior branches of the Culpeper or Colepeper family , a large , wealthy , landed family in Kent and Sussex .

He eventually took over his master 's shop at the Cross Daggers , Moorfields , before 1700 and this was given as his address in various advertisements from 1707 to 1731 , an address emblematically represented on his trade card . In 1710 he was visited by the noted German traveller Conrad von Uffenbach , who sought out the most eminent instrument makers in London .

"However , on behalf of many of my constituents — I am sure that this is true for many other people around the country — I should like to stress that , although none of us thought in 1979 that we would be discussing this situation today , as a result of it many of our constituents have received a quality of life far superior to that which they might otherwise have had . I certainly recall visiting residential and nursing homes in my constituency of which one could genuinely say that one would be pleased to be a member of that community . We are called upon to make such statements in all sorts of circumstances in our constituencies and sometimes we do it slightly with tongue in cheek , but I can genuinely make such a statement about many homes .

"He thus witnessed the birth of Saudi Arabia and could observe its growth and development at a crucial period in its history . By the time he left in 1931 it was clear to him that there was a need for the Dutch to establish trading and cultural links not only with Saudi Arabia but with the Yemen and Hadhramaut , and most of his subsequent career in Arabia was devoted to this end . Van Der Meulen 's austere but charming character was to stand him in good stead with the Saudis . He developed good relations , often deep friendships , with prominent figures of the time , including Ibn Saud , who frequently sought his advice and from whom Van Der Meulen was able to obtain a number of concessions for the Dutch . This last relationship is poignantly chronicled in his Faces in Shem ( 1961 ) .",0

"Ferocity is demonstrated , and the force of it received , through:(a ) the ritual killing of a mythical , fierce and excellent hunter,(b ) the ceremonial ( and actual ) rape of women , where a woman from each clan is chosen as object , and ( c ) a ceremonial pantomime of attack which opposes the moieties one to the other : one side in fierce , scowling stamping dance moves against a man of the opposite moiety who must not flinch , even if trampled ( Maybury - Lewis 1971 : 257 ) . As Maybury - Lewis remarks ( ibid . : 66 ) , ‘ the combination of sexuality and aggression could hardly be more aptly expressed than in a ceremonial rape’ . The women are also warned by the men that if they , the women , should set eyes on the masks of the ceremony , the men would manhandle , rape , and disfigure them .

A fortnight later , on the plains of the Namoi , Gould was thrilled to see the same bird in such great numbers that , when Natty drove them up before him , ' eight fell to a single discharge ' of his gun .

"Inevitably it was even more chaotic than the first , with no sort of line possible to be kept by the attackers , and what was left of the encampment now a shambles .

"Finally , grab yourself a makeshift whip : lash out at the face with the leather belt from your waist so that it cracks like the real thing . Or use a flexible tree branch or heavy jacket as a flail to beat the person back . If , by a stroke of luck , the knife is dropped , do n't make yourself vulnerable by bending down to pick it up ; jump in and kick it out of reach . Broken bottles are just as dangerous as knives and should be treated with equal respect . Sticks and chains , although sometimes lethal , are slightly easier to deal with , because unlike the knife and bottle , which are lethal at any distance , they are less adaptable .",0
"Just as Quexos 's Law required , his story had begun with a trio : himself , John Furie Zacharias , and between them , Judith . That arrangement had n't lasted very long . Within a few weeks of setting eyes on Judith he had managed to supersede Zacharias in her affections , and the three had dwindled to a blissful two . He and Judith had married , and lived happily for five years , until , for reasons he still did n't understand , their joy had foundered , and the two had become one . He was that one , of course , and the night found him sitting in the back of a purring car being driven around the frosty streets of London in search of somebody to help him finish the story .",0

The recommendations have received a mixed welcome from the Angling Foundation .

"Although most of the activities of the Young Conservatives may be ostensibly apolitical , nevertheless a tacit deal has been struck , which is of great political value to the main Party . As pan of its side of the deal , the senior branch allows the fun to continue ; it aids the YCs in material ways , by providing premises , helping with the occasional financial loan and generally keeping a benign eye on things . In return for the fun and games , the youthful members , whether or not interested in politics , are expected to help with the electioneering . In this way , the Party furnishes itself with an army of willing and uncomplaining helpers for the vital tasks of conducting electoral campaigns . In marginal constituencies the smoothness of the campaigning machine can make the difference between success or failure , and the Conservative Party generally has a reputation for efficient , well - financed organization .",0

"These in turn were similar in political structure and function to pre - war pressure groups which had reflected popular anxiety against German competition . There was some evidence , however , that for fascism to evolve in Britain , it needed to recruit new members from the lower middle and working classes , who had few , if any , previous political connections . Certainly many of the ordinary rank and file , like William Joyce in the early years , were of this nature ; and it seems significant that J. Havelock Wilson of the Seaman 's Union , a stalwart of working - class anti - socialist movements , spoke at an anti - Bolshevik meeting stewarded by 600 fascists at the Royal Albert Hall in 1926 ii Rotha Lintorn Orman was a spirited young middle - class woman who was concerned about the growing industrial unrest and threat to property posed by the emergence of a socialist Labour party and an alleged communist menace .

"It is our view that a lack of consensus about the nature of study skills and their appropriate organisation and delivery has characterised the project from beginning to end . Not least , participants at all levels have failed to establish clearly in their own minds the definition of , and relationship between , such concepts as "" study skills "" , "" library skills "" , "" information - handling skills "" and "" RBL "" . As a result , the deliberations of library committees and the Inservice Panel have often included debates held at cross purposes . Even in the Coordinating Team , the development of such skills has tended to be accepted as self - evidently a good thing rather than debated or interpreted in a systematic way . These observations have a particular point since it is arguable that a study skills "" tail "" is in danger of wagging a library project "" dog "" in at least some schools , and in the work of the Inservice Panel .",0
"It appears that due to the history and cultural values of Japan , it is easier for the Japanese to suppress their ‘ egos’ , focusing instead on the greater good . Transforming an idea into reality therefore becomes less of a problem as individuals are less likely to pose barriers . But they will , instead , ‘ fall in line’ to move an innovation ahead . The difficulty for Japanese corporations is the front end of the innovation process . Their devotion to the group makes it less likely that they will think in creative ways that are tangential to , or radically different from , those of the group .",0

"Duties are changing and accumulating at a faster rate than they can be successfully discharged . The extra time and support that are necessary ( a ) to perform jobs that are pressing at the limits of personal and material resources , and ( b ) to invest in learning how to do them better , or to assemble additional resources , so that the time taken to perform them is reduced , are not available . Opportunities to take seriously such issues as girls and science or the merits of negotiated assessment , or to acquire skills in the areas of active tutorial work or special educational needs are few and far between , and often have to be carved out of evenings and weekends . In addition to rate and resource limitations there are contradictions and conflicts within the set of jobs and goals that form a teacher 's working agenda . Teachers who listen to all the conflicting noises that are made about education by the pundits will inevitably feel ( quite apart from their own ideals ) that there is no pleasing all of the people all of the time .",0

The Unwins themselves — and it was impossible for anyone to grudge them their moment — said over and over that it was great , just great that one of the horses actually on the train had won one of the races , it made the whole thing worthwhile , and the whole party , drifting into the dining car in true party mood , agreed and applauded .",1
"It follows that in the neo - classical model , firms will be willing to supply the full employment level of real income ( Y f ) at each price level — thus , the AS curve is vertical at Y f . This is illustrated in Fig . 12 which also shows an upward - sloping short - run AS curve . In the short - run , firms will temporarily reduce output if the price level falls and will temporarily produce in excess of the full employment level of output if prices are high enough to make this profitable .

"To pinpoint single factors affecting inventories has proved difficult , although Kennedy ( 1986 ) notes that a modified stock - adjustment principle on the lines above helps explain changes in manufacturers ' inventories during much of the 1960s and 1970s . Investment has a dual role to play within any economy . In the short run , investment may be seen mainly as a component of aggregate demand which , if increased , will have the effect of stimulating the economy and , through the multiplier , substantially raising the level of National Income . Fixed and inventory investment together made up almost 13 % of TFE in 1991 . In the long run , investment will also affect the supply side of the economy , raising its productive potential and thereby pushing outwards the production frontier .",0

"Two other considerations relevant to the conduct of fiscal policy also should be mentioned . First , when governments want to make relatively large adjustments in their budgetary positions they may rely more upon changes in taxation than changes in public expenditures . Part of the explanation for this is that government spending tends to be planned over a number of years ( e.g. hospitals , schools , and other capital expenditures take several years to complete , and governments are reluctant to dismiss teachers , policemen , and other employees for short - term economic reasons ) ; consequently such expenditure tends to be fairly inflexible , especially downwards , in the short run . In contrast , tax rates are relatively easy to alter and so may be the more appropriate means to adjust fiscal policy when changing economic conditions require action . Secondly , when governments spend in excess of taxation receipts the budget deficit incurred will be reduced as income levels rise and taxation receipts subsequently increase .",0

"The miss rule that has dogged the game all season struck again in the third . Parrott , snookered behind green , was called four successive times by referee John Williams for a missed red . To his credit , Parrott ignored the 16 points loss and nibbled away to put a game on the scoreboard by a 73–48 margin . Hendry missed a red three times from a snooker in the sixth and lost by eight points as his rival levelled .

"But it seems likely that the importance of the plan in creating a ‘ growth climate’ diminished as the experience of rapid growth meant that business came to expect it anyway . This in itself , however , would be success of a sort . Even if the Plan 's effect on the level of accumulation was bound to diminish , it could still have significantly influenced its pattern . At least until the early 1970s , however , the government made no systematic attempt to shape the pattern of industry .

"If you wanted to know the answer , and if you also wanted to listen to Messrs Major , Kinnock and Ashdown , you had to keep zapping from channel to channel . After a while , the two programmes became strangely blurred into one . Dealing with Latin , Hittite and Basque is child 's play compared with understanding Majorese , Kinnockic and High Ashdonian . And yet these three languages , spoken almost exclusively in television studios ( despite claims by some scholars that proto - Majorese was once spoken in the streets of Brixton ) , are all somehow distantly related to English . High Ashdonian is the simplest of the three .",0

"Recollections of my Father by Clare Pain In trying to remember my Father I suppose the image that comes most vividly to mind is that of a tall , large - boned man with balding grey hair , a rather beautifully - shaped nose and kind but sad grey eyes . When gardening he often wore very baggy trousers with braces , gum boots and a waist - length black donkey jacket which hung loose and looked as if it was too short . I do n't remember him doing much digging in the garden but in my memory he is always mowing the lawn and fussing over a particular type of grass which evaded the blades and sprang back upright after the mower had passed over it . He solved the problem of how to eradicate this grass by commandeering a group of my school friends and myself with instructions to pick as many bundles of thirty of these grasses as we could , for which he paid us three - pence each .",1
"But it is critically important that the new administration pay serious attention to other foreign - policy issues right from the start . American relations with North ~ Korea , and the ongoing six - party talks , certainly belong at the top of the list . Here , the United ~ States must not only stay the course , but also build on the efforts of the last few years . The risks of changing course can not be overstated . Not long after President George ~ W .~ Bush came into office , his administration took a hard - line stance against the North ~ Korean regime , calling for a review of the Clinton administration ’s policy , and eventually tagging North ~ Korea as a member of the “ axis of evil . ”",0

"‘ Hollywood’ , he called it , compared with some of his more serious orchestral and instrumental works which could more properly be ranked with French films and Calvacante . ‘ It is of course a hotch - potch of good and bad’ said the Musical Times in 1930 , admitting that it also was nevertheless ‘ the hit of the season’ . A performance such as this persuades us that such assessments are quite wide of the mark , and almost as unjust as the neglect of Summer 's Last Will . Rio Grande 's gaiety and sense of beauty triumphantly survive the fashions that found it ‘ smart’ ; and a hotch - potch is exactly what it is not . One of the most striking qualities evident here is its unity , not a note too many or too few .",0

"If a snail is tapped on the head with a stick , it quickly withdraws into its shell .

"Boat Train The scene shifts to Liverpool Street . Those from the Kindertransporte with homes to go to — belonging to relatives , friends or sponsors — or to hostels , did not pause at Dovercourt but went straight to London , to a central distribution point set up by the RCM to the rear of the station concourse . Liverpool Street has changed enormously in recent years , but those who remember the taxi ramp leading into the station from the old Broad Street side will recognise immediately where the RCM set up shop . It was in the large , dimly - lit room below and to the left of the ramp , one of those cheerless spaces which Victorian architects ( or their clients ) felt bound to utilise , as with the arches of urban railway viaducts which were originally blocked off to make cheap classrooms for council schools and are now occupied by small garages and furniture makers .",1

"On occasion , it might refuse to work at all and we find ourselves longing for the days of youth when it would stand at attention regardless of any identifiable sexual stimulus .

While suffering from a temporary bout of impotence in my early twenties , I considered all the possible remedies ( from exotic aphrodisiacs to penile splints ) before paying a visit to my local GP , who consulted some weighty medical tome before advising me to avoid wearing excessively tight trousers .

"Women were in the audience when T. H. Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce had their encounter at Oxford in 1860 . One fainted , according to some reports , and had to be carried out — so tremendous had been the spectacle of a man of God slain by a man of science . The bishop had asked whether Huxley would prefer to think of himself descended from an ape on his grandfather 's or his grandmother 's side , thereby touching the sensitive nerve of female ancestry . Huxley 's retort that he would rather have an ape for an ancestor than a bishop — or words to that effect — has come to symbolize not merely the conflict between Darwinism and the Bible but the victory of science over religion . ' The Lord hath delivered him into mine hands ' was a phrase that came into Huxley 's mind , as he reminisced about the incident later .",0

"The Christian life - style , with its emphasis on the happiness and well - being of others , also brings fulfilment and can yield deeper satisfaction than the wholehearted pursuit of personal ends . Walking out on your partner may not be the answer to midlife change and you may not want a divorce , but you are likely to find that you need to update your relationship if the marriage is to be sound and mutually satisfying for another twenty or thirty years . Just as individuals need to take stock at this stage , in order to lay the ghosts of the past , grapple with the present and set new goals for the future , so a couple may need to reappraise their marriage in those same areas .

"If you remember , I 'd had trouble enough when I was fifty convincing people to take me on and now at fifty - nine or sixty there were hardly any employment opportunities left open to me .

However , after an uncomfortable night with hardly any sleep , a rudimentary wash at the station , an hour 's work , a long train journey , a long walk to a day centre for a shower , and then with another long walk ahead of me , the return train journey , a further hour 's hard work and another uncomfortable night , day in , day out — I 'm a sprightly so - and - so but something else on top of all that did seem like perhaps too much of a good thing .

"Two readers , Meryl Emerson of Alresford and Mrs. D. Dibble of Farnborough , are both agreed that if ever a shopkeeper deserved our Gold Star , it is Lena Kerry of Woolwork in Grosvenor Road , Aldershot , Hampshire . Meryl wrote to tell us of Lena 's general kindness , saying she found her the most helpful and patient person she knew . As a housewife and knitting club member , she ‘ took the plunge’ and opened Woolwork nearly ten years ago and Meryl reckons the success of the shop is due to Lena 's attitude of giving the same smiling service whether the customer wants a cone of yarn or the latest machine . She relates that Lena will even take the trouble to teach customers how to use machines that they have bought elsewhere and go out of her way to make deliveries , both free of charge . Mrs Dibble experienced Lena 's generosity when the ribber attachment she had bought from a mail order company would not work on her machine .",0
"In the Sandleford warren no rabbit of his age would have been asked to tell a story , except perhaps to a few friends alone . He had a wild , desperate air and his ears twitched continually . As he began to speak , he seemed to grow less and less aware of his audience and continually turned his head , as though listening to some sound , audible only to himself from the entrance tunnel behind him . But there was an arresting fascination in his voice , like the movement of wind and light on a meadow , and as its rhythm entered into his hearers the whole burrow became silent . The wind is blowing , blowing over the grass .",1

"Overwhelmingly for economic reasons , that is to say because they were poor . In spite of the political persecutions after 1848 , political or ideological refugees formed only a small fraction of mass emigration , even in 1849–54 , though at one time the radicals among them controlled half the German - language press of the United States , which they used to denounce their country of refuge . Their rank - and - file soon settled down abroad like most non - ideological migrants transferring their revolutionary energies to the anti - slavery campaign . The flight of religious sects seeking greater freedom to pursue their often rather peculiar activities was probably less significant than in the previous half - century , if only because mid - Victorian governments held no strong views about orthodoxy as such , though probably not displeased to see the heels of the British or Danish Mormons , whose penchant for polygamy created problems . Even in eastern Europe the active anti - semitic campaigns , which were to stimulate the mass emigration of the Jews , still lay in the future .",0
"People could send telegrams , telephone each other , and transmit information much more quickly than ever before . Meeting an obligation to threaten , or to make peace , took much less time than before . Using cash and bank accounts to collect and disburse contributions for welfare , was easier than collecting animals on the hoof , grains or sugar in sacks , and it was much easier to transfer the payments . Arguments about the quality of particular animals in a payment scarcely arose when the payment was in a standardized currency : no one asked , ‘ Well now , which of these dinars do you promise me?’ If the costs were lower than before , so too were the risks : the police force was well informed because it had members who were also members of the local lineages ; and it was ready to intervene to prevent escalation of disputes into further bloodshed .",0
"They take no one over 65 , and retirement at 70 is obligatory . The reply to my letter tamely confirmed this , explaining that it was considered wasteful and expensive to train anyone of that age , for their service would be too short . Reading between the lines , what they meant was that they were not going to train people who might keel over and die before the CAB had had its money 's worth . I 've just had a Christmas card from my old healthy friend ; so that 's two years ' service they 've lost for starters . Do n't younger people move , have babies , and otherwise change direction ?",0

"Unfortunately the evidence for their production is limited as glass - houses leave little archaeological evidence when all of the waste can be re - cycled . Harden 's type - series ( 1956b , pp . 139–43 ) divided the total assemblage into a number of distinct categories , beakers with stems or claws , bell , bag or cone - shaped , with the related horns , pouch bottles , squat jars , bottles , palm cups and bowls , to which has been added a bucket - shaped vessel from the cemetery of Westgarth Gardens , Bury St Edmunds ( Suffolk ) ; slight variations have been made to the original typology ( Harden 1978 , pp . 2–6 ) . Attempts to characterise glass with a view to understanding its technology and source have been made , but glass is a difficult material to work with in this way because of compositional irregularities ( Sanderson and Hunter 1980 ; Hunter 1985 ) . There are , for instance , no apparent compositional differences between Roman and Anglo - Saxon glass vessels ( Sanderson , Hunter and Warren 1984 ) although there are marked changes in appearance ; this may be the result of a decrease in technological ability . Anglo - Saxon glass displays a variety of colours , especially brown , ochre , yellow , blue and green , which are probably brought about by a lack of control of the furnace conditions rather than by deliberate colouring .",0

Such room for manoeuvre as existed in choosing between these two evils was only present in the very short run .

If she had come into his mind he had operated his cancelling switch as he did when any of the denizens of Ecalpemos strayed into his thoughts . Once , not long ago , an old film called National Velvet had been on television and when the young Elizabeth Taylor appeared on the screen he had at once been sharply reminded of Mary — and had exited , not with the escape key but with the switch on the set .",0

"Kelly will not have it , however , that Celtic 's finances have any bearing on the manager 's performance . ' Any analysis of big clubs who have tried to buy success would show that it is only a tiny minority who succeed in doing so . ' Celtic 's problem is that Rangers are one of the tiny minority and they have been the pre - eminent team on a domestic level , while the other half of the Old Firm have gone four years without winning anything . Brady does not absolve himself from criticism over his part in that state of affairs . ' The match with Dundee is a test of character for me and my players , ' he stated .",1
"Our wind playing , however , is an incredibly high standard and what we have got in our orchestras are brilliant sight readers and if you want a sort of erm an orchestra to learn something then an English orchestra will take , I do n't know , a quarter of the time that any other Continental orchestra will take . They are very , very , very quick indeed and very , very efficient , and this is why , since the War London has been the centre of the recording industry , simply because it 's been worth the while for Americans in recording companies , for example , to record in London rather than anywhere else because we are so efficient .

"First , the earliest investment projects undertaken are likely to be the most profitable , i.e. offering the highest expected yearly returns ( R ) , and therefore having the highest marginal efficiencies of investment ( i ) . As more projects are initiated , they are likely to be less and less profitable , with lower expected yearly returns , and therefore lower MEIs . Second , a rise in the level of investment undertaken is , at least in the short run , likely to raise the supply price ( S ) , which in turn will reduce the MEI . This could follow if the capital goods producing industries faced capacity constraints in their attempt to raise output in the short run . The decision on whether to proceed with an investment project will depend on the relationship between the rate of interest ( r ) and the marginal efficiency of investment ( i ) .",0

"For example , the Altrincham governors could have argued that there was a safety risk in the girls wearing scarves in the laboratory or workshop — although it is by no means clear that they would have succeeded on this basis . It may be that the wearing of jewellery ( such as ear studs , as favoured by some groups ) could also pose a risk to safety in certain situations . But what if a school wished to ban Sikh girls from wearing trousers , and sought to justify its action with the argument that to create an exception from school rules for Sikhs would cause resentment from whites and thus work to the detriment of racial harmony ? The answer , in the light of the Mandla case , would appear to be that the school would be acting unlawfully . To take a further example , suppose that a school had arranged a school trip abroad during a week which coincided with a Jewish religious festival .",1

On a more blatant , if less exalted , level , the force of friction makes its appearance in the first days of any first - year course . We declare , as if there can be no doubt , that friction impedes the motion between two bodies , and we invoke sophisticated microscopic models that show how the soles of running shoes bind to a track . Yet friction produces heat and thus an increase in entropy – which measures the amount of energy that can not be used to perform work – and it therefore distinguishes past from future .",1

Thus James Bentham writes of the Fens : ' The smallest spots , however , scattered or remote , which first showed themselves above the surrounding waters , were eagerly seized upon by these watchful discoverers , and claimed as part of their allotted reward . ' It was a similar story in Somerset in the same period , worsened by the fact that access to the moor along the old drove - ways was severed by the new drainage ditches .",0

"Because , Nizan asserts , Friedmann is unable to perceive the necessity of the organic link between theory and practice , he is led not only to the purely academic conclusion that it is incorrect to speak of the "" philosophy "" of either Lenin or Stalin , but also , and more significantly , to an inability to perceive the fundamentally different objectives pursued by Lenin and Trotsky . "" There is no longer any possible comparison to be made between the man who is actively organising the construction of socialism , and the man who is endeavouring to wreck it . "" There is nothing tongue - in - cheek about these statements . Nizan is not simply mouthing the party line here . This is the expression of a man deeply committed to the practical development of the Soviet socialist state , dismissive of esoteric philosophical debates which fail to take into account the material conditions of the socialist experiment , and preoccupied above all with the need to defend an increasingly isolated Soviet Union from potentially damaging criticisms , however well intentioned they might be .",0

"Their cash holdings declined at an annual rate of 7 % in the last three months of 1992 . Meanwhile , another source of cash — bank borrowing — has become steadily less attractive . In recent years , desperate to boost their operating profits and absorb bad loans , banks have begun charging corporate borrowers the full whack . Their lending rates have not fallen in line with their funding costs ; banks ' margins have widened by about two percentage points since early 1991 . Smithers calculates that to finance a corporate - sector deficit of ¥ 40 trillion at the current high corporate - borrowing rate of 5 % ( almost 4 % after inflation ) would cost ¥ 2 trillion a year .",0
"There was a direct connection with the shipyards , not only in terms of orders by British owners ( who now build abroad to a far greater extent than any other non - flag of convenience maritime nation ) , but through the training of engineering officers who traditionally served their time as fitters in the yards or engine works before going to sea . The Tyne seamen have had some sort of union organization since the seventeenth century . The present - day National Union of Seamen was founded on the north east coast , which was also a major centre for the Seamen 's Reform Movement which recaptured the union for the rank - and - file in the mid-1960s .

If the cuddly Lord Spencer , for whom the nation held its breath as he walked down the aisle of St Paul 's Cathedral to give away his daughter Diana , will be sorely missed , it is far from clear whether the departure of his widow from Althorp will be seen as a loss .

"The difficulty was that any additional building — of squash - courts , swimming pool , or even classrooms — could by now only take place at the expense of valuable playing - field space . From his office window , the Bursar could see a quarter of an acre of dense undergrowth lying behind the School Pavilion ; it was once the site of the Convent greenhouses and allotments , but now unused and neglected . An idea began to form in his mind , but the Governors were apprehensive about taking on more commitments — faced with the abolition of the Direct Grant , they had decided to go "" Independent "" , and in the circumstances they thought it best to consolidate and take stock , rather than expand . There the matter might have rested , but Hodgkinson had to meet Sister Elizabeth , the Headmistress of the Convent High School , to discuss the shared use of the sports facilities . He learned that that school would shortly be closing : the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury , as the body responsible for its denominational education in Stockport , planned to build a new comprehensive secondary school in Cheadle , St. James 's , and to convert St. Michael 's on Nangreave Road into a Sixth Form College .",0

"The process of sense selection is , of course , extremely complex , with many interacting factors . However , in general , one can say that a hearer selects that combination of lexical readings which leads to the most normal possible utterance - in - context . In other words , a hearer will generally assume that the producer of an utterance wants to communicate something , and has chosen the linguistic context of his utterance with a view to furthering this aim . Broadly speaking , we can identify two types of normality — sentence - internal normality and contextual normality ( it is probably the case that the latter is the stronger determinant of sense selection ) . Very often a sentence contains more than one ambiguous word form ; in such cases , there will occur a kind of mutual negotiation between the various options so as to achieve the most normal combination .",0

Equally , his brace against Manchester United in our last match of 1990–91 ( co - incidentally also his own 150th Palace appearance ) demonstrated that he was on the verge of international recognition , with the second one , struck from fully 30 yards , bringing the big crowd to its feet in salute .

On the subject of the ghost train , the shepherd was not prepared to make any comment . The two friends took stock of everything in the immediate vicinity . On their left was a field of sheep ; to their right was a grass field which appeared to be uninhabited . It was a perfect summer 's night , warm and still .",0
"But now , as an economy measure , those all - expenses - paid tickets have been withdrawn . Instead , IFEMA have plunged down the desperate road of offering ten complimentary booths to leading galleries , which had not committed to attend the fair , in an attempt to bolster ARCO 's international image . But , as several dealers told The Art Newspaper , waiving exhibition fees is a concession which makes little difference if a gallery can not make sufficient sales to recoup costs estimated at £ 10,000–40,000 for taking stock and staff to Madrid . Here is the crux of the problem which ARCO faces . Even at the market 's peak , Spanish collectors were not buying international art and the elevated expectations of the foreign dealers were usually frustrated .",0
"The South ~ China ~ Sea , for example , is now churning with competing claims to its islands , atolls , and sea bed , including China 's bold assertion that all of it is Chinese sovereign territory . At this year 's ASEAN summit in Bali , it was agreed that these territorial disputes be settled through bilateral negotiations . But the scope of Chinese claims doomed that agreement from the start ; indeed , China now insists that the sea constitutes a core national interest , on a level with Taiwan and Tibet , for which it is prepared to fight . China 's willingness to throw its weight around amplifies the grave imbalance in size , and leverage , between it and the other countries bordering the South ~ China ~ Sea . This has made bilateral negotiations to settle these disputes unviable .",1

"Their successors include Graham Greene , Sir Yehudi Menuhin , Lord Zuckerman , Dame Veronica Wedgwood , Sir Sidney Nolan , Sir Isaiah Berlin and professor Dorothy Hodgkin . A perk of the office is to be invited to lunch with the Queen every few years . Some of them are also Companions of Honour , an order additional used as a way of rewarding prime ministers ' political friends , so ‘ that Norman Tebbitt and Lord Whitelaw , neither known as retiring aesthetes , rub shoulders with Anthony Powell , Lucien Freud and Dame Ninette de Valois . The honours system provides governments with a means of distributing favours at no cost . Macmillan showered political honours on his backbenchers like confetti , and during the thirteen years of Conservative government which ended in 1964 over two hundred MPs , one third of all those who sat on the Tory benches , were rewarded with some sort of gong .",0
"If FIFA ever had the foresight to forego football and organise the World Cup for Misbehaviour , Scotland would undoubtedly be the bookie 's favourite and Thomas Henderson Docherty would be an inevitable choice as manager . In the mid ' 70s , while he was still manager of Manchester United , The Doc frequently appeared on ITV in a commercial for Gillette 2 razor - blades . His catch line was , ' I can honestly say it 's the closest shave I 've ever had . ' Of course it was a complete lie . Nobody has brushed with the law quite like The Doc .",0
"With the two children on the back seat warmly covered , Florence pushed . We set off . Peering through glass misted over with our breathing , I crawled over De Waal Drive , got lost for a while in the streets of Claremont , then found Lansdowne Road .

"I realized society did n't value my passion . So I went back to my college and became a typical Japanese worker as a systems engineer . I felt my passion , heart and soul , had left my body .

"It applies to health right across the board . As far as ho erm the H R T is erm here we go you see , this is post - natal illness this is right , we need one on that as well , but what we need to know , and what we need to be aware of , is that the discussion has to be actually put out through the members in the same sort of way as Ken and Peggy have done in the erm Midland and East Coast region and also on Working Women 's Safety , it needs to be taken on board that we are absolutely fed up , sick to death and absolutely running out of patience at having to hammer home this thing about equality . There is no need for us to actually have to drill into people , that we do n't want to be bullied , pushed around , and that nine times out of ten , the violence or the bullying is male to female . It 's not always that way , but we are absolutely sick and tired of it and it 's about and sisters , that whenever we come across it , we make sure that those people do n't continue that type of harassment . With apologies for not being a perfect speech , but without any apologies for the symptoms that I 'm suffering too , because you all need to know about that as well .",0
"Linked to this is the third factor , the cost of employing these additional workers , and how this sum matches up to the value of the output achieved by each additional worker . The aim of the training programme outlined earlier is to raise substantially the skills of both those in work and those seeking it . It has to be accepted that , in the short run , it is difficult to raise the skills , and therefore the value of the output of marginal workers ( marginal in the sense of their position in competing for work ) . What can be altered in the short term is the cost of employing new workers , and this can be achieved either by forcing down wages , or by reducing the employer 's costs . Ashby 's idea is that the government should introduce a system of employment vouchers , valued at around £ 3–4,000 , for unemployed people unable to find employment after at least two years on ET and a temporary work scheme .",0
"In retrospect , it seems obvious that Mosley would use his grasp and understanding of politics to take control of world motor sport .

"It 's the one room that has in some way to accommodate the changing interests of all members of the family ; it 's also the room that is most on show , the room where your guests stay the longest . Since a living room is literally the room for general living it often has to serve as a study , playroom and dining room as well and still manage to reflect your tastes and be a comfortable extension of your personality — or personalities . Everybody , including the family pets , should be able to stake a claim in the living room and feel thoroughly at home there . So how do you set about decorating it for all its possible different uses ? How do you make it a room that is as pleasant to live in as it is to look at ?",0

"In line with the Green Paper which preceded it , it advocated an increased use of curfew orders , day centres , community service , bail hostels , electronic monitoring , financial penalties , and combinations of financial penalties , and community punishment . The success of the Criminal Justice Bill stemming from the White Paper ultimately depends on the judiciary and the magistracy changing their sentencing strategies . This can happen , as local initiatives with magistrates have shown but the prognosis for major change on a national level is , judging from the history of earlier attempts , gloomy . This will require the Court of Appeal to extend its work on guideline sentences to more relatively minor crimes . This is a gamble , and there are indications that the Court of Appeal may refuse , seeing this as political interference with the judiciary .",1
"Holly was withdrawn , private . He felt no call to share the small purseful of glory . To his left three guards had taken the strain on a rope that ran tight and stretched to the building .

"Of course it would be unusual to be permanently in an optimistic state of mind , but who do you think gets more pleasure out of life ? Let us suppose the Smith family have planned a picnic in the country in a few days time . Mr Smith — a pessimist — starts to worry in case it rains , the car breaks down , they are plagued by insects or one of the children gets lost . Mrs Smith , however , envisages a glorious sunny day , delicious food , fresh country air and time to relax with her husband and children . However the day turns out , she will already have enjoyed the prospect and had the excitement of looking forward to a pleasurable outing .",1
"Wanna buy a cheap motor guv ? Well now 's the time . They 're at rock bottom prices , and the only way is up . The dramatic collapse of the value of second hand supercars is illustrated by the unseemly squabbling over the perceived value of a new Jaguar XJ220 . Now the company is warning potential purchasers to pay up or else .",0
"This monetary expansion leads to an increase in aggregate demand ( as explained above ) and firms begin to increase their prices ; they also raise their money wage rates in order to attract more labour . Since unemployed workers are expecting zero price inflation , they perceive the rise in money wages ( 4 per cent in Fig . 6.4 ) as a rise in real wages and some of them accept job offers which they might otherwise have refused . In the short - run , then , unemployment falls to U * and output rises . The government at first believes that its policy has been successful : unemployment has been reduced at the cost of 4 per cent inflation . The economy has moved from point D to point E.",0
"Reviewing the novel in the London Times , A. S. Byatt noted approvingly that this theme of identity and difference was neatly encapsulated in the names of the two women , Hilary being derived from the Latin hilaritas , or Joy . Now I can be quite sure I had not intended this pleasing symmetry . I called Philip 's wife Hilary in a previous novel , Changing Places , because it is an androgynous name and at that stage of their marriage she was the dominant partner in the marriage , or , as the saying is , wore the trousers . I called Joy , Joy because when Philip falls in love with her he is in pursuit of what he calls ‘ intensity of experience’ , an essentially Romantic quest with a capital R , and joy is a key word in Romanticism . At the moment of consummation , Philip shouts aloud the word ‘ Joy’ , which is both exclamation and apostrophe .",0
"It all depends where I land.’ He stopped again and , taking her firmly now by the arm , pulled her into a shop doorway and , looking into her eyes , he said , ‘ If it was n't for leaving you I 'd be glad to go , and … and I thought you 'd be proud of me going.’ ‘ Oh , Joe’— she turned her head slowly to the side —‘don't start on that again ; you … you know nothing can come of it.’ ‘ Why not?’ ‘ Look , do n't be silly.’",1
"Sabraxis had come to visit Lucien in his room as soon as he was well enough to converse . She was a tall , muscly woman , of handsome countenance , her faded blonde hair held up with an array of jewelled combs . Like all the other vibrancers in the house , she wore loose trousers and a shirt of pale colours , but also affected a bright red embroidered waistcoat to denote her superiority in status . She instructed Lucien to be careful with his leg , and to exercise the rest of his body only while lying or sitting down for a while . She did not want him to exercise his leg until the infected burn had healed completely .",1

"There is good reason for this . DDR citizens have a right to a passport but only conditional rights to a visa for departure . Possible reasons for non - approval run the gamut from the usual to the astounding . That a visa for travel to West Germany can be refused on ‘ moral’ grounds is highly unusual ; a regard for ‘ national security’is much more the norm … will it mean no visas for all ‘ bearers of state secrets’ , a category which can be variously defined from one individual case to the next ? … Judging by the mood prevalent up till now in the DDR the planned freedom of travel will scarcely influence those who want to leave because their patience is at an end and their trust in the government has been destroyed .",0

"Hinterstoisser , startled in the act of untying his climbing rope , missed his footing and plunged . The movement of the rope pulling the injured climber from his stance , he fell , a rope coil whipped around his neck and he strangled . He hung some fifteen feet below Kurz , on the same rope ; and their joint weight thrust their remaining comrade against a piton . Charsky watched him freeze to death before his eyes .

"The old gentleman was a continual critic of the City Council and started in the late ‘ twenties , in conjunction with Mr. Allan B. Lemon , the well - known Salisbury Solicitor , a Salisbury Ratepayers’ Association . The Ratepayers ' Magazine could be described as a local ‘ Private Eye’ . Another of Mr. Talbot 's activities was the loaning of money at a fair old rate of interest but he did not believe in spending a penny to smarten his premises from which the paint was peeling so badly that bare wood was revealed . Next to Talbot 's was The George Herbert Elementary School which from 1919 , became a girls - only institution , the boys being taught at St. Martin 's . The school seemed cold and it was certainly dark for the main windows faced north and tall buildings surrounded it on the other three sides .",1

"She had hoped for a new freedom , but had found a trap . She went to her doctor for sleeping pills and a tonic , though he himself was a better tonic than anything in a bottle . The doctor , universally known as ' Hubert ' , was rotund , but it was a jolly bouncing roundness , not like the disgusting pot - bellied men who do n't know whether to wear their trousers above or below their pots . The perfectly symmetrical large football was crowned by a smaller one : his head . And that in turn was crowned , incongruously , by a mop of unruly brown curls , giving him the appearance of an inflated schoolboy — Billy Bunter , in fact .",1

"At all other values for the real wage , output is constrained either by the unwillingness of firms to produce more output or by the unwillingness of households to provide more labour services but not by both at the same time . Only at w * ; will firms and households be unwilling to alter their realized behaviour . Why do suppliers , including the suppliers of factor services , increase output in the short run as a result of an increase in the absolute price level ? Some new classical writers have sought to answer this question by referring to the ‘ island parable’ . Suppose the economy is not one large , unified entity but is instead divided into a large number of islands .",0

"At every moment she caught sight of some slight figure with twinkling knees , slim golden calves , and massed , luxuriant hair . She felt uneasy ; she did not fit in here at all .

She felt like a peasant .",1
"Great Britain 's was a peculiar case . She could do without large conscript armies to defend land frontiers and needed long - service troops who could be employed overseas for long periods . As a result , the small British army had a high degree of expertise in irregular and colonial warfare , could be deployed easily over great distances by sea , and had a rank - and - file which was possibly better trained than that of any other great power . Its corresponding defects were that it was almost insignificant in Europe , retained out - of - date weapons adequate only for colonial use , and paid little attention to training its senior officers for large - scale operations . It had no permanent general staff .",0

"In the 1960s and early 1970s , the left on Tyneside regarded trade union politics as massively more important than local government politics . The leading lights of the working class were plant convenors and lodge secretaries , not elected councillors , who were generally , and not wholly inaccurately , regarded as a collection of third - rate nuggets . In 1975 when North Tyneside and Ben well CDPs attempted to locate ‘ change agents’ with sufficient force to have some impact on the structural origins of the situation in the two locales , the obvious target was the rank - and - file organizations of the traditional industrial working class . It would be very difficult to arrive at the same conclusion in 1988 . During this syndicalist period the ‘ official’ movement was wholly committed to participation in the programme of modernization in which it participated with regional capital and the associated regional élite ( see Ben well CDP , 1978 ) .",0
"When the British were attacked for their role in the Boer War , Hyndman and Quelch for the British Social Democratic Federation prepared a dossier on the crimes of other imperial powers as the basis for condemning all — and so exonerating the British as no worse than the rest . Others began to develop a countercase . At Amsterdam in 1904 , a Dutch delegate , Van Kol , threw down the gauntlet —‘The new needs which will make themselves felt after the victory of the working class and its economic emancipation will make the possession of colonies necessary , even under the future socialist system of government . , The need for tropical products , for outlets for exports and surplus population and to offset ‘ the deadly competition of colonial labour’ , all entailed rethinking the old position . ‘ Can we abandon half the globe to the caprice of peoples still in their infancy … ? Must we not understand by socialization of the means of production that the means of living and working belong to everyone?’",0
"Last summer in Leeds she had seen the burlesque Little Jack Sheppard , when the Gaiety 's new manager , George Edwardes , sent it on tour .

They look up to the English players and try to copy them as they feel that is the right way to behave . Sometimes they just go over the top .

"If one of those bombs went off prematurely we would all have been blown off the roof , and what good would that have done anyone ? We could hear the engines revving up as one by one the aircraft started their nerve - wracking blind journey down the runway , and miraculously each managed a safe take - off without dislodging their bombs . We could n't see the slightest movement in the fog , but gradually the noise of the engines diminished and died away , and the collective sigh of relief from the top of Flying Control must have had some part in the clearance of the fog , as by the time all four aircraft returned ( bomb - less ) we could actually see the 1,000 yard marker on the other side of the field . This was only a temporary relief , though . The fog came back over and over again that late autumn and early winter , and the dark days before Christmas that year were very dark indeed .",1
"‘ It has obviously set back our restoration work,’ Mr Rutter said , ‘ but the worst aspect is the effect it will have on the morale of volunteers . ‘ They feel they are wasting their time because their hard work is getting smashed up .

"On all crucial passages of a rock ridge , the rope should be kept right . A question for the middlemen is the choice of which side to put the rope . Climbing steep snow in a series of zigzags as in ( Fig . 2b ) , the axe is held in the uphill hand and the rope goes on the downhill side direct to the next person on the rope . This prevents the rope getting twisted round the back in such a way that a downward pull rotates and dislodges the body . When the party changes direction , the middlemen step over the rope behind them and the rope is transferred to the correct downhill side .",1

"Munich became synonymous in Nizan 's vocabulary with the abandonment of the principles of collective security , the deliberate mystification of nation states , appeasement , acquiescence and capitulation to fascist oppression and death . With the fall of Madrid in March 1939,118 and the worsening situation in Poland,""19 Nizan 's attitude became progressively more desperate , more frenetic . In this context of impending war , Nizan began clutching at straws . Miraculously , during the early months of 1939 , the much vaunted tripartite agreement between France , Great Britain and the USSR , the cornerstone of collective security and peace , seemed somehow to be within grasp . It is ironic , in retrospect , that Nizan 's leading article announcing the seemingly miraculous news was published on 1 April 1939 .",0

"The feeling of the meeting was very positive and constructive and there were no recriminations . The desire was to learn a lesson from the past and put something together with limited objectives.’ Outlining the proposals , which will be put in writing to the Bank of England task force set up in to pick up the pieces after Taurus , Mr Pearson said the key point was that any new system should focus solely on the professional market — leaving the private shareholder with paper certificates and the existing fortnightly settlement system . But for the institutions , he said , the initial aim would be to introduce a ten - day , rolling settlement system which could be reduced in stages as it became practical , first to five days and then to three days . He said a ten - day system could probably be implemented ‘ fairly quickly’ , reducing the risk factor by a factor of ten in the process .",0

"One reaction to this style is that it is merely game - playing , and rather tedious at that . But the elevation of style functions as a distancing device , especially needful when , as in the passage quoted , Paul 's death scene is still fresh in the mind . Classical polysyllables such as solicitude and calamity keep feelings at bay , so that the reader is led into a frame of mind where the farcical aspects of the good Captain 's behaviour can innocently rub shoulders with tragedy . Dickens varies his style like a virtuoso who can grade and colour the tone of his instrument as the mood requires . Yet this variation takes place within the encompassing medium of a pervasive Dickensian style .",0

"Partnerships , small scale as well as large , need a clear sense of purpose made explicit in objectives , they need a strategic plan for achieving these objectives which is communicated to and understood by those involved and they need a review and evaluation process built into the whole to determine what is being achieved . Planning advice for those responsible for establishing partnerships of various kinds is now widely available . Rational planning models have several shortcomings — there is the danger that the plan becomes all important , the wider goals get lost . There is the danger that the plan becomes fossilised , static and unresponsive to new intelligence or other changed circumstances . The most serious danger , however , is that the ‘ people bit’ gets lost — plans often assume that people will work and prosecute them in logical , rational ways , which of course they do not .",1
"When his head jerked back to look up at Grant again , it was n't his teeth that were gleaming in the dark now , it was the whites of his eyes , wide with fear . For a sickening moment he swung wildly on the rope and one of his feet slipped a few inches down the wall . Grant 's heart leapt into his mouth and he was convinced Larsen was going to lose his nerve , then his grip on the rope , to plummet down to an unthinkable death . But then the other man seemed to regain control of himself , for the next moment he was shinning up the rope as though he had just realised his life depended on it — quite literally ! Seconds later , Larsen tumbled breathlessly over the edge of the stone coping , helped by a strong one - handed pull on his collar from Grant .",1

With neutral Hampden Park ruled out due to renovation work , Rangers manager Walter Smith and Celtic No.2 Joe Jordan were involved in the bizarre situation of having to toss a coin to determine the semi - final venue .

"In 1988 , I was producing a major women 's conference at the Barbican and we needed a big bank of flowers .

I was his assistant and when he wanted flowers he would send me to the Old Covent Garden at 4.30am to buy hundreds of pots of chrysanthemums which would then be sold off at the end of the day , thus serving a dual purpose as decoration and a means of recouping some of our costs . I realised things might not be the same nowadays so , ten days before the conference , my assistant Joanne and I went down to Covent Garden ( which is now at Nine Elms ) and had a trial run .

"This odd reversal of polygyny has been attributed to a very high rate of ground predation whereby clutches are easily lost . If a female , in a short breeding season , has to re - establish her clutch in relation to a single mate , clutch loss becomes a very serious matter which the male can do little about . If , however , she keeps mating and not only gets several clutches going but is able to re - establish those that get lost , then she maximizes her chance of a successful breeding season . In this case too , by maximizing their caring role , males ensure as far as possible that their young are ‘ got off’ successfully . In these birds male care is the limiting resource and females show the increased size and dominance which in polygynous species accrue to the males ( see Jenni 1974 ) .",1

"A trade unionism that is paralysed by an obsession with parliamentary lobbying and television training for general secretaries can scarcely expect to win the wholehearted support even of its own members , let alone women engaged in domestic labour , part - time workers or the unemployed .

The miners ' strike revealed the range of new movements and organisations which have been arenas , if complex and contradictory , for the development of working - class culture and working - class consciousness , promising to broaden traditional conceptions of the composition and objectives of the labour movement yet also portraying the unions ' capacity to ignore that potential when it stepped beyond the domestic and controllable to stake its own claims for recognition .

The same failure to push out of defence quickly and as a unit when clearing their lines , which gives the goalkeeper a clearer view and often wins an offside decision , helped Gannon score a well - taken winner , also from outside the penalty area . Wolves huffed and puffed , but they could not blow Tracey 's house down again .",0

"After all , Wang Laboratories Inc and Prime Computer Inc are just two of a string of companies that have opened and later closed in the south of Ireland , but Amdahl Corp is still there , Intel Corp is investing heavily and expanding , 3Com Corp and Cabletron Systems Inc are among the new arrivals , and several other chipmakers are still doing assembly and Sun Microsystems Inc has just followed ICL Plc and Sema Group Plc in establishing software development operations in the Dublin area . And a handful of critics is beginning to wonder whether Ireland has not concentrated a little too hard on attracting inward investors at the expense of building a strong home - grown computer and electronics industry : after all , the policy of rallying all centres of higher education to turn out highly - skilled hardware and software engineers has been a great success , but should n't more of those people be working for Irish companies ? After all , at the most basic level , Ireland should be a superb base for establishing a rock - bottom high volume personal computer manufacturing business that could knock spots off Tulip Computers NV with its lower costs and be challenging Elonex Plc and the tartan Americans led by Compaq Computer Corp and IBM Corp , not to mention Ireland 's own foster - sons Dell Computer Corp in Limerick , and Apple Computer Inc in Cork . Nor are the prospects , even for Galway , as bad as they appear at the moment : workers reportedly wept openly in the Digital canteen when told their jobs were being phased out over the next 12 months , but the fear that most of the subcontractors that served DEC will have to close as well is not likely to be realised : where a company has a good relationship with a subcontractor , there are good reasons for maintaining that relationship even after a plant closes , and work should start flowing across the Irish Sea all the way to Galway from Scotland . Business leaders have moved into Galway to repair the damage with task forces to help create replacement jobs .",0

"' None of the individual specifications appears to embrace the whole of the mechanical conditions to be dealt with , but there were many good points contained in the specifications of Messrs. Glover and Messrs. Gwynne ; and it would appear that a combination of certain facets of these two schemes would produce a highly satisfactory machine . For instance , the hauling of drums proposed by Messrs. Glover are without doubt the best system and these can be applied to the original idea which has been adapted by Messrs Gwynne , viz : one free balance rope and two hauling ropes to each tank . Then , Messrs. Gwynne 's proposal for equalising the strain on each individual rope by means of connected hydraulic rams is most satisfactory , as also is their suggesting for actuating the lift - up gates by means of hydraulic pressure utilising the engine for pumping up the accumulator .

"An important objective in counselling is to help the older individual live for today rather than for an uncertain tomorrow . Counselling should encourage reflection on the past , and use the life review as a positive , formative part of growing into old age . When older people think of the past they are not just taking stock of their lives but trying to decide what to do with the time that they have left , and trying to do so in relation to concluding or making sense of what has gone before . They are checking on the legacy they want to leave behind them . This can be seen to coincide with the characteristics of an ‘ ideal’ old age outlined by Erikson ( 1965)(see page 40–42 ) , concerned with identity and generativity .",0

As they walked to the hotel car park across the road , two young art student types , thin girls with long black hair and western eyes , stopped and asked him if he could help them work their camera , they were out on an assignment and it would n't go at all , and Rory fiddled something on the side and gave it back and said : ‘ That should be it now , the poor ould thing should be in a museum’ , and as they went away looked back at him , and back again . ‘ They love you,’ said Jessica , with delight .",0
"Newly - weds Martin and Andrea Stevens , who were married in November , were spending their honeymoon on day trips from their Darlington home when one outing turned into a nightmare .

"Undue influence A most relevant factor in this appeal is the extent and effect of the intervention of the mother who was alone with her daughter immediately before each of the two occasions that Miss T. indicated her rejection of a blood transfusion . It is an irresistible inference that before 5 p.m. the mother had discussed the question of blood transfusions with her daughter because Miss T. ‘ out of the blue’ according to the nurse raised the subject . The mother was also alone in the ambulance with her daughter when she was transferred about 11 p.m. to the labour ward in another part of the hospital shortly before she signed the refusal form . The judge referred to the ‘ mother 's fervent belief in the sin of blood transfusion’ and that Miss T. had reached her decision under the influence of her mother , but none the less found that Miss T.

I do not enter upon the controversy as to what duty , if any , lay upon the medical advisers to give her that advice : that no explanation whatever was given is an accepted fact in the case .",0

He was always loyal and when we had a house maid who adored Basil and had little affection for his sisters and she used to stand up for him as hardly done by , he would have none of it , to my remembered satisfaction .",0

"Impossible to tell , however , despite this openness , what Alix and Esther really made of Charles . They teased him , tolerated him , avoided him .

"In temperament he was not unlike Surere , a career official who had dedicated himself to climbing to the top of the power structure , though he had chosen the priesthood as his channel . He was as inflexible in his allegiance to Amun and the old gods as Surere was to the Aten , and during the reign of Akhenaten he had fled to the oasis of Kharga to escape death . His loyalty had stood him in good stead after the restoration , and he was now a commissioner of police for religious conformity — a post which did not prevent him from working in any other area which Horemheb , through the king , saw fit to appoint him to . ‘ When did this happen?’ ‘ Yesterday.’",0

"We 've all grown accustomed to using credit . There can be a danger point , however , when the use of credit gets out of control , and unfortunately , with all the variety of credit available , it is sometimes too easy to avoid recognising the danger until it is acute . If the amount outstanding on your credit or store cards seem always to creep up rather than down ; if you put off paying the electricity bills because you have other commitments to meet ; if you are seriously thinking of accepting the offer of a ' consolidation ' loan which is secured on your house to mop up all your existing credit agreements and transform them into a once a month payment , then you could be on or near the danger line . Many people who get seriously into debt do so through no fault of their own . They may be made redundant or their marriage may break up ; even the loss of regular overtime can have a disastrous effect on someone living to the limits of his or her income .",1

"The aim would ultimately be for a speaker independent system , allowing continuous speech , with a large vocabulary , and this has only recently become a practical possibility as speech recognition methods have shifted to phoneme - based systems , using transitional probabilities and methods such as hidden Markov models to allow sequences of phonemes found in English ( or whatever language is being considered ) and reject others . The problem is still that the location of beginnings and ends of words are never certain . Consequently most of the speech recognition research has concentrated on the pattern recognition level , and references to the use of higher level information of the language are mainly theoretical . In fact a large vocabulary system accepting natural language is simpler to obtain for written language than for spoken , because the recognition units ( i.e. letters ) appear to be easier to identify , and identifying word breaks is not such a problem . Letter databases needed for matching are smaller , but give a much larger number of potential candidates .",1

"She said that some social workers were uneasy about that , and she agreed that it involved trust , but it was also to avoid abandoning the problem to someone else . What is also new , she emphasised , is that the assessment is of a need , not for a particular service . It will then be up to a care manager to decide on the level of service . This will probably involve a social worker in an area team putting together a package that might consist of a few hours of home care , a couple of days of day care , and night sitting for one night . ‘ Probably these people do n't need a formal care manager , though someone will be responsible for them,’ says Stephenson .",1

"There would have been the ill - lit halls , impractical sanitary arrangements , filthy rush - laid floors and sparsely furnished rooms ; and if period duplicates had existed of Elizabethan interiors or classical Queen Anne houses that showed the inadequate lighting , heating and plumbing of the sixteenth , seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , how much easier , the guests agreed , it would be to appreciate the modern refinements which their own contemporaries took so much for granted . Excitement mounted ; in her memoirs Princess Marie Louise quotes Sir Edwin Lutyens as saying , ' Let us devise and design for all time something which will enable future generations to see how a king and queen of England lived in the twentieth century , and what authors , artists and craftsmen of note there were during their reign . ' By this time Lutyens was drawing on every menu card available — not even the napkins and tablecloths escaped — enthusiastically filling them with plans and designs . No detail was to be considered too trivial or unimportant ; from the attic to the cellar the house was to be a national treasure , an accurate record for children , adults , and future historians , and a monument in minute perfection of all that was best in British workmanship .

"The area to the south of Saville Street which had been the commercial centre for the port was already in a state of decay with banks , etc . moving north towards residential areas . There had been some war damage but this was not on a scale which lent itself to large - scale redevelopment . In April 1961 , Tyne mouth CBC 's Town Improvement Committee authorized a survey with a view to the declaration of a Comprehensive Development Area . The report was presented in June 1962 by the Town Clerk and Borough Surveyor and indicated the desirability of seeking a partnership between the Corporation and a development company which would regard development as a long - term investment and be interested in the equity .

"Their day , however , had not been that good ; they had put in many hours of searching and had only made two finds of any note .

"Greenhouse gases are the direct result of pollution , and the indirect result of a reduction in the atmosphere 's ability to absorb them . Plants convert carbon dioxide into oxygen . Chopping down forests to clear land for cattle , as world demand for hamburgers soars , may be good business in the short run , but its long - run effect on the accumulation of greenhouse gases is significant . The consequence is global warming .

"But while some senior Tories are urging a softening of the ‘ no compromise’ line on Scotland , others are urging the party to stand firm and endorse an approach which increased the party 's vote north of the border by 1.5 per cent . Ian Lang , the Scottish Secretary , said on Friday that it was now time to change ‘ the tone and mood of Scottish politics’ and added : ‘ I have always accepted that a referendum could be an appropriate mechanism for sounding out opinion , particularly on constitutional issues.’ But another senior Cabinet figure said the party had no need to take stock over policy on Scotland . ‘ No , we do not need to do that .

"Just as Commercial Banks have collected deposits from the public so also has the state through the Postal Savings system , where savers can accumulate several tax - free accounts by using fictitious names . These funds have been used to finance the work of specialist quasi - public financial institutions in a range of activities from overseas projects to long - term loans for the purchase of specialist equipment . Although the share of state borrowing in total company finance has recently been relatively small at about 10 per cent , in a qualitative sense even a small loan by a state institution carries a seal of approval that enormously enhances the standing of companies with their banks . In equity finance , the state has allowed the lower dependence of Japanese firms to continue by treating loan interest as tax deductible in contrast to dividends . This practice is also not unknown elsewhere , but the preferential treatment for corporate dividend receivers where the effective tax rate is ‘ close to zero’(Aoki 1984 p.238 ) , has been a clear incentive to intercompany stockholding .",0

"They only become annoying , meaningless rituals if they are too rigid or obsessive — when a routine tidying up session turns into a ‘ you must always put away all your toys and clothes before you get into bed’ command , no matter what the unusual circumstances may be that night . As I have suggested , routines are useful in pre - empting some of the confrontations that arise over getting up , getting washed , getting dressed , getting fed , getting the school bus on time , and so on . These routines , carried out on ‘ autopilot’ , help a child undertake daily tasks around the clock with minimum effort or fuss — once the habits are learned . Giving very young children too much choice over when to get up , what to wear or what they eat for breakfast can be a recipe for disaster — acrimonious arguments , delays and tantrums . This does not contradict the general guideline that children be given the opportunity to make choices or to discuss reasons .",0
"Just compare the broadsheet coverage of our conference at the end of September with that for the Law Society 's conference last weekend !

Nonetheless the format for the 1993 Conference is under active consideration with a view to reducing the deficit . Professional Fees have risen from £ 10,000 to nearly £ 42,000 largely because of the need to employ solicitors , surveyors and agents for the move of the Council 's offices to Bedford Row . The 1990–91 figure of £ 50,000 under Continuing Education was set aside for a pupillage sinking fund .",0
"The tenant 's adviser has two approaches . If the additional expenditure would be recoverable by the landlord through the service charge , he may reasonably point out that the landlord will not suffer any actual loss . Consequently , the landlord has no financial interest in preventing the tenant from using the building round the clock , and may have a financial interest in permitting him to do so , since the rent may be enhanced on review . If , however , the expenditure is not so recoverable , the tenant may have to agree either to forego such services out of hours or to pay the costs of them . In any case , however , the landlord should insist that the tenant either pays for the costs of security , or indemnifies the landlord against third party claims arising out of the use of the building out of hours .",0

Optimistic leaks had it that the negotiators were making good progress on a statement of ‘ principles’ . In the end , they agreed only ‘ to take stock and keep in touch’ . If the British were indeed talking about principles , it was a mistake ; it is a mistake to negotiate with the Chinese about generalities . China 's own demands are said to be precise .",0
"The two principal schools of thought were “ roll back ” and “ containment . ” The former argued that nothing less than overthrowing communism – “ regime - change ” in today ’s parlance – would do . The latter approach held that efforts to roll back Communism in the short run were too risky , given the Soviet nuclear arsenal , and that the United ~ States and the West should content themselves with limiting the spread of Soviet power and influence . Containment prevailed , but this hardly settled the debate , as there were intense arguments both over where it should be applied ( Vietnam , Central ~ America , and the Middle ~ East all come to mind ) and how it should be carried out , i.e. , the right mix of military force , covert action , diplomacy and arms control , and economic sanctions and assistance .

"But neither citizens nor policymakers appear willing to bear its social and political costs . In a charged and uncertain political climate , in which new crises erupt on a daily basis , it is unsurprising that economic reform has been postponed repeatedly . Politicians know that macroeconomic stabilization and social cohesion can be irreconcilable in the short run . Slashing food and energy subsidies in order to reduce fiscal strain is unlikely to win favor in a country like Egypt , where 40 % of per capita income is allocated to food . Politics is thus constraining efforts to strengthen public finances .",0

"It is certainly the case that Stirling Council has what is probably one of the most progressive same - sex - sharing tenancy policies in the country . In Scotland , the only way of gauging the effectiveness of this approach would be through a survey of the lesbian and gay community , but there , as in the rest of Britain , such expensive research is no longer a priority for hard - pressed local councils . The lesbian and gay issue featured prominently in the Tory propaganda war against the GLC , although more on the level of rumour and innuendo than on the public level . As the date of abolition ( April 1986 ) drew nearer , activists in London were determined that the momentum should not be lost in this area of local government work . Many more lesbians and gays were openly involved in their local Labour parties than would have been the case even five years previously , and they ensured that the Labour manifestos in the 1986 council elections included commitments to lesbian and gay work .",1

This produced a deep sense of betrayal amongst workers ; and the ' civil war , between rank - and - file workers and the official union was essentially what turned the strike into a protracted struggle . Lane and Roberts argued that strikes are not difficult to explain . They are ' normal events ' , arising almost naturally out of the circumstances of the employment relationship itself : ' A wildcat can break out in perfectly normal conditions , and the structure of the relations between employers , trade unions , governments and workers guarantees that some strikes will grow from small beginnings into mighty struggles'(p.241 ) .",0

( 1 ) In all the circumstances is it more appropriate that a court of the country to which a child has been wrongfully removed or in which it is being wrongfully retained ( country B)’— in this case one can say England —‘should reach decisions and make orders with a view to its welfare or is it more appropriate that this should be done by a court of the country from which it was removed or to which its return has been wrongfully prevented ( [ Australia])?(2 ) If , but only if , the answer to the first question is that the court of [ England]is the more appropriate court , should that court give any consideration whatsoever to what further orders should be made other than for the immediate return of the child to [ Australia]and for ensuring its welfare pending the resumption or assumption of jurisdiction by the courts of that country ? ‘ In considering the first issue , the court of [ England]should approach the matter by giving the fullest force to the policy which clearly underlies the Convention and the Act , namely that wrongful removal or retention shall not confer any benefit or advantage on the person ( usually a parent ) who has committed the wrongful act .

Mind over matter Thanks to the action of the autonomic nervous system , any disorder of the digestive system can be exacerbated by the emotions — IBS is not unique in this respect .

"They are highspeed ones but run slower than in Europe . With the temperature at -15 ° C maybe it is no bad thing to run them slowly . The Georgians tend to start the lifts only when they have to , so if you are first up each lift , you ask them to open the next one ! Once running , no problems — unless they break down , which resulted in a very short first day for us .

Accordingly , Belinda left the veranda and went to her room , deciding on the way that she would wear her new black evening trousers and the pale apricot silk camisole top she had bought to go with them . It was the first silk garment she had owned , and it had been expensive , but Faye 's silk clothes always looked and felt so wonderful … It did n't take her long to dress , freshen her make - up and add touches of silver jewellery on ears , neck and wrists , and it was quite a bit less than Tom 's stipulated twenty minutes later when she approached the veranda again .",1
"Portraying himself as political outsider , Perot had become a beneficiary of the current anti - incumbent mood of the electorate , and had received some impressive opinion poll ratings . Increasingly , however , his policies and personality had been subjected to close scrutiny by both the media and the Republican Party , causing him to complain that the latter was pursuing a smear campaign against him [ see p. 38953 ] . His autocratic style , his disapproval of whole social groups ( such as adulterers and homosexuals ) , and the eccentricity of some of his views —he was known to dislike men with beards and women who wore trousers —all served to dent his early showing in the polls . Perot was also damaged by his own political naïveté , as for example on July 12 when he addressed the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People —his first major campaign appearance before a black audience —and offended many in the audience by the insensitivity of his remarks , which included references to "" you people "" . With Perot 's standing in the polls declining sharply , his campaign co - manager , Edward J. Rollins , resigned on July 15 .",1

"An alternative view was expressed that the NRC were under the direct influence of the Home Office , thus undermining any form of independence previously enjoyed by Chief Constables ( Scraton , 1985a ) . The notion of police audiences provides a useful basis on which to explain why this policy was adopted . Taking the influence of occupational audiences first , it is reasonable to assume that rank - and - file preference would be to avoid ‘ another Saltley’ . Senior ACPO members , notably its president Charles McLachlan , the Chief Constable of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary , also prioritised the right to work over the right to picket . Therefore , there was strong pressure on chief constables to adopt a hard - line approach from within their own institution .",0

When the children were between four and seven years old , they were each given a task — a video - type game — and were assessed on their levels of cooperation and concentration .

"As a result , 1993 and 1994 should be important years for LASMO as exploration drilling proceeds in Algeria , Libya , Yemen and Vietnam , each of which is considered to offer significant potential .

"Perhaps the greatest challenge for mental health services in the 1990s is securing adequate housing for former patients in the community . Some of the criticisms which are voiced by service planners and professionals when thinking about ordinary housing for long - term patients is that it is ‘ too expensive’ , or that ‘ They ca n't cope on their own,’ or that ‘ They 'll be affected by the same stresses and strains that put them in hospital in the first place.’ But community services for mentally handicapped people have demonstrated that it is possible to provide for quite severely disturbed , multiply - handicapped people in specially adapted ordinary flats and houses , as long as there are sufficient well - trained staff to provide good - quality care round the clock , and provided the staff themselves are well supported by senior professionals with the right experience . Mental health services have unfortunately been generally reluctant to follow this good example and are still developing too many large group homes and hostels which create too many segregated communities of mentally disturbed people . If community care is to function properly , suitable housing must be affordable on the low income support funds available for unemployed disabled people .",0
"Indeed , Buzzell and Gale ( 1987 ) also point this out . First , it needs to be made clear that high returns now must be distinguished from high returns in the long run . In a declining market one might well expect a business that had earlier established a dominant share position to be able to trade on this position in the short run and increase prices and profits , because rivals are unlikely to come into the market or compete strongly for market share . Also , it might be able to increase revenues as rivals drop out of the market . This does not mean , however , that one should invest in that declining industry beyond the level justified by short - run returns .",0

"The conventional accounts of violence against women suggest that most men who are violent to women are mentally unstable in some way . They argue that these men have suffered bad childhood experiences which have prevented their normal development . These accounts imply that incidents of violence against women are few and far between ; that they are products of a few sick individuals . However , these explanations of violence against women do not tally with the evidence of the extent of the violence nor its continuity with other forms of male conduct towards women . Rape and battering are merely one end of a continuum of aggressive forms of behaviour of men to women .",0

An intense heat spread through her quivering , eager figure , and she rejoiced in the overwhelmingly sensual pleasure of their entwined bodies , welcoming the deep , shuddering thrust of his virile manhood . And then all conscious thought was obliterated as an urgent , tingling excitement contracted through her body , and she was soaring free with him into realms of exquisite delight , where their hearts and souls became one . ‘ You see — we did n't wake the children , after all,’ Ross drawled , his eyes glinting with amusement as he gazed warmly down at the soft figure in his arms . ‘ They might have had a good sleep — but we certainly haven't!’",1

"Or perhaps more sophisticated methods are applied along the lines suggested by Friedman 's permanent income hypothesis . No matter : Lucas assumes that workers follow some procedure for arriving at an estimate of their normal or permanent real wage rate . So let us take stock of where we have reached so far in our analysis of the Lucas business cycle model . When prices are fluctuating , general confusion prevails regarding the behaviour of relative prices . In particular workers may come to the conclusion that their real wage rate is fluctuating procyclically ( this surmise may , in fact , turn out to have been erroneous , but that is another story ) : when prices are rising more rapidly than previously , workers suspect that the real wage rate has also risen .",0

"John McAdam ( 1756–1836 ) concerned himself less with the bed of the road and more with drainage . He stressed consistency and proper and regular supervision . His basic method became a generic term in the English language , and his special contribution was to develop an economical way of bringing and keeping existing roads up to scratch . Thomas Telford ( 1757–1834 ) was renowned as a bridge - builder , but he produced roads of great solidity through the intermeshing of small , angular stones . Only the wealthier trusts could afford his standards , but if they did so they purchased a road good for more than a century .",0
"It can be argued , however , that the dichotomy often noted between the more restrictive business union orientation in the United States and European ' welfare ' unionism concerned with wider social objectives as well as the terms and conditions of employment of union members , is somewhat overdrawn . In recent years US unions have not been inactive in the political sphere and have actually had a large degree of impact on influencing legislation concerned with broader social and economic issues ( Lewin , 1978 ) . Also , although in European countries some union leaders undoubtedly regard trade unions as having a mainly political role to help change the social and economic order , many rank - and - file members appear to view unions differently — as instrumental agencies concerned with matters arising in the employment relationship . Van de Vall ( 1970 ) showed that among Dutch unionists the most prevalent motive for taking up membership was to secure individual ' conflict insurance'(i.e . the provision of legal and material assistance in possible disputes with the employer and protection against arbitrary management decisions ) . Similarly , despite the incessant advocation of the abolition of the private enterprise system by two of the major French unions , a majority of French workers seemed unconvinced , and rejected the legitimacy of the unions ' attempt to relate ' industrial ' and ' political'issues in shopfloor agitation ( Gallie , 1978 ) .",0

"F 1 : There are two forms of justification , inferential and non - inferential . But there is another characteristic strand to foundationalism , that of empiricism . Foundationalism , viewed quite generally ( though here we must exclude Wittgenstein ) , can be seen as the expression of the empiricist thought that verification and justification , telling whether something is true and backing up one 's claims about what is true , must rely eventually upon the evidence of one 's senses ; not in the first instance , maybe , but at the end of the day . What else could we appeal to , to tell us whether something is true , than the evidence of our senses ? This is a good sound empiricist question .",0

"Big barbel though , have a distinct preference for swims that combine three factors : a fairly slack piece of water adjacent to a fast run , and especially where these two preside over a dense weedbed or some other kind of refuge such as a hole , steep ledge or sunken tree .

There are times when barbel are so preoccupied with whatever business they have at hand , whether it be feeding , spawning , or just browsing , you can stand on the river 's edge right over the top of them and watch them without them taking fright and scurrying off . If you can get so close to barbel , with or without them knowing it , you should take the opportunity to study how they use the available cover to sneak under ; how they move like silent wraiths across the bottom , and how they rake over the gravel on the bottom with their barbules .

"Despite the reassuring noises of the Royal Commission in 1979 , by 1984 the UK 's Standing Technical Advisory Committee on Water Quality ( STACWQ ) reported that , if present trends of fertiliser use were to continue , mean nitrogen levels in surface waters would increase by 2–3 mg / litre ( as nitrogen ) by 1994–2004 and this would cause widespread breaches of the 11.3 mg / litre nitrogen level ( 50 mg / litre nitrate ) . Supplies to millions of people would be affected . The Department of the Environment ( DoE ) had foreseen difficulties with the Directive , and now asked the Department of Health for advice on nitrate levels , most probably so that the UK could argue for laxer standards . Unlike the US agencies and the EC , the DHSS / DoE Joint Committee on Medical Aspects of Water Quality proposed in 1984 that it would be acceptable to relax the EC standard by 60 per cent , from 50 to 80 mg / litre .

"Hartlepool Boys Welfare featherweight Alan Temple reached the Royal Albert Hall finals on May 6 and said : ‘ There 's no way I 'll turn pro.’ Green was certainly unlucky , losing to Wales 's Mark Newton in a bout in which he admitted he was drawn into a slugging match rather than using his skills . He was given a questionable standing count in the second of three thrilling rounds , but he spent too much time battling rather than boxing and too much time on the ropes instead of using his footwork .

"The holding company form has been used to provide a buffer between the state enterprises themselves and political direction by the state . Management autonomy has led to serious problems of control . Merely giving management its ‘ marching orders’ proved insufficient to ensure that the principal economic function of producing goods and services was carried out efficiently and without becoming an additional strain on state finances . Indeed , a major concern of many state enterprises in early post - war Europe was the physical reconstitution of the depleted or war - damaged infrastructure of railways , power stations and so on . Financial constraints on investment were relatively unimportant and only developed subsequently as political concern with state enterprise deficits prompted efforts for greater commercialism .",0

"So if a group is to be given authority , its members must be held accountable as a group , and unless this is done , it is very hard to take so - called group decisions seriously . If the CEO or the manager of the group is held accountable for outcomes , then in the final analysis , he or she will have to agree with group decisions or have the authority to block them , which means that the group never really had decision - making power to begin with . Alternatively , if groups are allowed to make decisions without their manager 's seal of approval , then accountability as such will suffer , for if a group does badly , the group is never fired ( and it would be shocking if it were ) . In the long run , therefore , group authority without group accountability is dysfunctional , and group authority with group accountability is unacceptable . So images of organizations that are more like symphony orchestras or hospitals or the British Raj are surely nothing more than metaphors to express a desired feeling of togetherness — the togetherness produced by a conductor 's baton , the shared concern of doctors and nurses for their patients , or the apparent unity of the British civil service in India .",0

"The problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys and arranging mortgage finance , without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price . Not surprisingly , several estate agents report difficulties at the moment in attracting enough serious bidders . ‘ With an auction , you 've got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can commit themselves , and the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed are few and far between,’ said David Phillip , a director of Yorkshire estate agents Dacre Son and Hartley . Bristol and West hopes that by arranging collective auctions it will be able to overcome this problem . It is also guaranteeing mortgages at 1 per cent below the normal interest rate , for endowment or pension - linked policies , on several of the houses up for sale , an interesting and innovative service for would - be bidders ( mortgage surveys will already have been undertaken for these houses ) .",0
"It was in this situation that the Bolsheviks assumed power . Until the start of the civil war , in the summer of 1918 , there was a relative lull in the social conflicts during which the Bolsheviks shared power with the Left Social - Revolutionaries and at the same time attempted to obtain the collaboration of some sections of the bourgeoisie and industrial managers in their efforts to revive industry . There was no immediate move to take into state ownership the major manufacturing industries , although there was a vigorous campaign to extend what was called workers ' control , i.e. the supervision of owners and managers by rank - and - file committees . The Bolsheviks , on the insistent urging of Lenin , moved with caution in relation to nationalisation during this period . It is true that certain measures of nationalisation had been undertaken in the first months of Soviet government — for example , the Merchant Marine had been taken over in January 1918 and the sugar industry nationalised in May of that year — but the main efforts had been directed towards a stabilisation and regularisation of the tottering economy on the existing basis of ownership .",0

Having spent a healthy proportion of his personal wealth in a bid to provide a Premier Division platform for the club , figures show the public are not responding through the Dens Park turnstiles . Successive visits by Motherwell and Airdrie have seen attendances recorded at 3,370 and 3,079 respectively ; clearly insufficient numbers to maintain the running of a full - time outfit at Dens Park , let alone allow the investment manager Simon Stainrod says is required on the playing staff .",0

"The failed short - list candidates are surrounded by increasing circles of other disappointed souls : to continue our horseracing imagery , the front - runners are followed by the minor placings , those who met the headhunter and talked at length about the opportunity , who were among the top ten , but not the top three or four . Beyond them are the also - rans , other disaffected characters , who were on the receiving end of tempting , exciting , ego - boosting telephone calls which were never subsequently followed up , from headhunters of whom they never heard anything again . Even further out , with less reason for antagonism towards search consultants but still known to bear malice , are the hopefuls who never appeared on the race card at all , who sent in their CVs and waited in vain for a response . Many candidates all down the line think of headhunters as privileged individuals able to hand out plum jobs willy - nilly to those in their favour ; at the same time — somewhat contradictorily — they regard them as dodgy , cowboy characters who have arrived at their coveted positions in life after having failed at everything else they have attempted .

"This figure accounts for almost 5 % of Grampian 's total exports , and is significantly higher than the national figure of 2 % . The reason for the relatively high proportion of exports destined for this area is that much of the export activity is oil related . It is evident that the expertise and contacts Grampian companies have developed through supplying the North Sea oil industry stands them in good stead to take advantage of oil related opportunities in the Middle East . The major export destination within the Middle East is the United Arab Emirates , with exports of £ 6.7 million , representing a 20 % increase on the 1989 figure . It appears that the Gulf War has had little effect on exports to this area , although it should be added that much of the conflict post dated the period covered by the survey .",0

"A suicide note revealed they were desperate after years of caring for the seriously handicapped daughter . They said they loved her dearly — but their pleas for help from social services had been ignored .

"Alexei had risen before the sun broke the horizon , and because he was engaged to wait upon Jehana at the house of her father — a public display to advertise the fact of their intended betrothal which was designed , he guessed , to make it believable — he was among the first to witness the damage which the teams of wrights and carpenters now laboured to repair . That much of the decoration was shredded or defaced beyond hope of repair , Alexei thought , was quite clear . Clad in a coat which was so stiff with gold wire and seed pearls that he could scarcely bend his arms he rode with his escort beneath a line of arches which were suspended on ropes between houses on opposite sides of one of the main streets . The material which yesterday had draped them now lay in discarded heaps on the stones of the paving below , and men were hastily tacking new lengths — the mercers and drapers must have ransacked their warehouses to find enough , and the cost would no doubt make the court treasurer blench — to the framework . The troopers of the Kha - Khan 's guard who were detailed to line the processional route had been pressed into service to clear away the debris , and their facial expressions reflected their feelings as the dye from the cloth stained their hands and surcoats .",1

"Those in the lower group of six would play a total of 36 matches with the first two teams keeping their place in the Premier Division while the rest would be relegated in 1994 . There is a general acceptance that any stepping stone plan for next season must accommodate the two clubs which earn promotion from this year 's First Division . Since there is little support for a temporary return to a Premier Division of 16 — this arrangement , of course , would deny the city clubs income generated by extra matches against Rangers and Celtic — a league set - up of 14 - 12 - 12 is on the cards for 1993 - 94 . Thereafter , the long - term future of the game could be resolved by a 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 formula which would stimulate interest at the lower end of the league as well as at the top .

"Building societies and banks have finally abandoned their secrecy and pretence over their ‘ inspection’ and do not call it a structural survey any more . It is a report and valuation for mortgage and insurance assessment which is usually done in half an hour and consists of a general look at the property to see that it actually exists as described , and is not in a state of collapse or major disrepair . In actual fact I have seen valuations which are so wide of the mark ( more than 50 % in one case ) that one suspects that some valuers know little about the property market and even less about rebuilding costs , which constitute the basis for insurance . Needless to say , they usually undervalue the property and never inspect it thoroughly . Their report is of little practical use and in some cases can be positively misleading , but the building societies and banks insist upon having it .",0

"It is possible to nuance this view slightly as regards the Edinburgh union leadership . There may just have been some hope of effecting change through organization , especially when the numbers of women were still low ( about 300 at the end of the 18805 ) , though the means chosen were not welcomed by the rank and file of the men 's union . Although unfortunately details of the projects are tantalizingly hard to ascertain , at least two attempts were made after 1888 by the Edinburgh Typographical Society to set up a women 's union , The first , in the late 1880s , is referred to only in the retrospective "" statement on the Female Question "" , published in 1904 ; Miss Black of London [ who must have been Clementina Black]a lady who was well - known for her efforts to improve the social condition of her sex , offered to make an endeavour to organise the female compositors in Edinburgh , with a view to remedying the evils complained of by the journeymen . The branch committee favourably entertained Miss Black 's assistance , but on it being remitted to a general meeting of the Society , it was rejected on the grounds that if the females were organised , their position would be improved as an industry for females , which would result in great accession to their numbers in the printing trade in Edinburgh . "" What seems to have happened here ( as on other matters ) is a division of Opinion between the ETS committee who may have been quite sincere in trying a long - term solution — and the knee - jerk reaction of the membership against the permanent acceptance of women as compositors which the project undeniably contained .",0

Now , I know a sum of money of nearly twenty thousand may not seem a lot of money in total , it 's not a lot of money in terms of , it can be quite a large sum in terms of doing things with economic development .

"Similarly , if women 's role as workers is emphasised to the detriment of consideration of their role as housewives and — more particularly — their role as mothers , then the ‘ proletarianisation’ of women could confine them and their children to dependence on means - tested state benefits and/or low pay from part - time ‘ women 's work’ . In short , they and their children would be condemned to grinding poverty and , if their income comes from the state , to permanent state surveillance , not in this case for cohabitation but for ‘ scrounging’ . Both Fairbairns and Donnison , for their different reasons and from very different political perspectives ( the former a radical feminist largely concerned with relations between men and women , the latter a left - of - centre policy - maker and academic , largely concerned with social inequality and the alleviation of poverty ) , understand and accept that , at least in the short run , women are going to continue their multiple roles . Both of them take the present sexual division of labour as given and understand that this has important implications for women in their search for an income . They identify the central issue as that of dependency : given the sexual division of labour , women , unlike men , have dependants who need them for their very survival .",0

"Soft top- and front - designs could also be developed to minimise pedestrian injury once a collision has occurred , such as impact - absorbing bumpers , recessed windscreen wiper spindles , and hard junctions between bonnet and wing moved to the sides rather than the top of the car . This approach is typified by Mackay , who has argued that because injury reduction was more realistic in the short term than accident prevention , one should think of the front end of a car ' primarily as a structure with which to hit a pedestrian ' . Vehicle lighting systems could be improved too , though it is true to say that much could also be gained by improving the conspicuity of pedestrians at night and in fog and rain . Secondly , much effort over the years has gone into education for road safety , though the concentration on advice to adult pedestrians and training for children has the unfortunate effect of apparently placing on the victim the principal responsibility for avoiding an accident . The OECD has recently recommended instead that education for improving safety of pedestrians should be aimed at motorists as well as pedestrians , perhaps via mass - media campaigns .",1

Finally , on a more subtle level , there may be mental blocks which can have an effect on the emotional and physical planes .

Most of the blocks mentioned here are at the physical level , but the emotional and mental blocks are equally important .

We believe that a concerted effort to reform football ( soccer ) refereeing is urgently needed .

Since such errors have major implications for the outcome of key tournaments which define this most global of sports , their ubiquity and frequency jeopardize the game ’s very integrity – and thus its essential legitimacy .

But even writers who have no historical sense , like Mrs Radcliffe ( who provides Emily in 1584 with what is clearly a cottage ornee , complete with greenhouse , ‘ two excellent sitting rooms’ and a rustic hall ) , are much more observant than their predecessors of different types of houses in the landscape .",0
"The drive from Alison McLean 's Didcot home to work is relatively short , but it brings back terrifying memories . It 's only 3 months since her car was written off in an accident on the A34 in Oxfordshire ; an accident in which she was lucky to escape with her life . In heavy fog she collided with a lorry . Her Metro spun across the carriageway , hit the crash barrier and ended up in the southbound lane , just avoiding a head on collision with on - coming traffic . She was cleared of blame , so was stunned when she received a letter from the local authority requesting payment for repairs to the crash barrier .",1

"But anyway w w we 're on board with the the general thing which is important . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry I 've been a bit steady getting there , but I think it 's an important issue to tackle that , quality is horses for courses and we have to accept the fact that we 're gon na get prestige type jobs and quick slick jobs , especially in the beginning of March every year .

"But the militants at grassroots level ruthlessly exploited discontent over pay and strikes spread like a virus . Between 1976 and 1977 the number of working days lost trebled to 10 million ( compared to 759,000 last year ) . Schoolteachers , power workers , post office engineers , staff at the Royal Mint and sections of the newspaper industry were among those who either struck or worked to rule in a bid to break the pay policy . Then , in November 1978 , Ford , battered by a lengthy stoppage by 57,000 workers , rebelled and agreed a 17 per cent deal . The government , trapped by its own policies , had no choice but to retaliate , ‘ blacking’ the company 's products in the public sector .",0

"He found it in the fact that the State , ‘ united for once in spirit’ and ‘ with the fervent consent of the people of every land subject to the rule of our King’had entered on an arduous conflict , not for territory or glory but ‘ for the sake of enforcing the plainest rules of international justice and the plainest dictates of common humanity’ . From this event Dicey detected a ‘ good omen for the happy development of popular government’ . Here again Dicey seems wide of the mark . Not only did the First World War produce a major crisis of authority for the old order , but it also resulted in the harnessing by the State , on an unprecedented scale , of the power and resources of the nation towards the war effort . This experience was not lost on socialists .",0
"‘ I am not one for shilly - shallying , as well you know , Forest — in the event , I should make sure you were Will Slaughter 's next victim.’ ‘ Slaughter , you say ?

"The strike was broken only by widespread flogging and imprisonment , but it was clear that if the Danzig Poles — by tradition the meekest of them all — were willing to protest , then Polish resistance as a whole must have stiffened considerably . In spite of Polish protest the Haketa continued and extended the range of its work . It Germanised the few Polish street , town and place names , undertook propagandist ‘ research work’ on historical subjects , supervised the Germanising of family names among those Poles who decided to take the plunge into German identity , took down Polish - language warning notices about venereal diseases from public toilets and instituted a system of bonuses for all teachers and civil servants prepared to move and settle in the eastern provinces . Neither land nor language was the real issue , however . These were the mere surface indicators of deeper problems , the media through which the deep , internal cultural and economic pressures at work within German society showed themselves .",0

"' I think that the boot may be on the other leg ! ' After prospecting the places to put the booms across , dictated by the situations of suitable anchoring rocks , they returned to the castle . Ramsay was interested to note , in the passing , how as a couple of boats entered the harbour ahead of them from the fishing , under the bridge between the two outermost towers , they each provided a basket of new - caught fish to be hoisted up on ropes to men on the bridge , this seemingly how they paid their rents and harbour dues to their lord . That evening , in the hall , Mariot entertained them with songs , accompanied by the harp , to their enjoyment ; although Ramsay qualified his rapture by some regret that , there being insufficient room in their ingle - neuk for playing the harp , she had to perform outside it , and he was deprived of the nearness which he found so much to his taste . However , singing over , and Agnes bringing wine to sip , he got his companion back alongside for a little , before the bedward move was made .",1
"Gower said : ‘ It 's disappointing and frustrating because I feel I 'm in good nick . ‘ In many ways , it could not have come at a worse time because the selectors are obviously considering alternatives after the defeat at Old Trafford and I would like to think I would be one of them.’ Gower broke the rib attempting a diving catch against Nottinghamshire earlier this week during a championship match which saw him score 153 and stake a claim for an England recall . Fletcher was also denied a chance to check on the form of Kent pacemen Martin McCague and Alan Igglesden who were both sidelined by injury . Igglesden is still troubled by the groin strain which forced him to pull out of the squad for the first Test at Old Trafford while McCague was nursing a pulled hamstring .",0
"A very thin rope is fixed thirty centimetres above the ground . People who want to become the King 's most important officials jump and dance on this rope , and whoever jumps highest without falling gets the best job . Sometimes the King orders his lords to dance on the rope , to show that they can still do it . This sport is , of course , rather dangerous , and there are occasional deaths as a result . It seems a strange way of choosing officials .",1
"In the middle of the trivia , the stuff that could easily have been 1930 or 1960 , there was information for the gleaning . It was n't by any means a straightforward process .

"The guitar 's dimensions do limit its penetrating power , but what you get instead is a sparkly , ultra - fast response that clearly articulates fingerpicked notes as fast as you can spit them out . This is one of those guitars that imparts a whole new sonic quality to even the oldest of the old faves — bizarre , but addictive . Cosmetically , the NY-5 is a bit over the top . The ‘ rope’ binding around the front and headstock is very tasty , as are the snowflake fingerboard inlays ( although they could have been installed straighter ) but I 'm not at all sure about the classical - style rosette complete with touches of green and fluorescent pink .

"Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with ‘ care in the community’ in mind , but most were based in specialist settings . For example , Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties , and was designed to offer respite ‘ round the clock’ care . Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long - stay placements far from home . By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children 's respite care unit at Leigh Road .",0

"But in the higher latitudes , i.e. nearer to the poles , timing becomes progressively more critical , and the period when food is plentiful becomes shorter . To balance this , there are more daylight hours available to hasten plant , insect and plankton growth . This means that the feeding of nestlings has to be much more intensive , and parent birds must work almost round the clock to raise a brood successfully before the icy hand of autumn sends insects into hibernation , covers up seeds and vegetation with ice and snow , or sends the fish out into deeper water . The Shetland Islands , the most northerly part of the United Kingdom at sixty degrees north , lie well south the true Arctic , but still far enough north that in midsummer the sun only sets for an hour or two . The summer season is consequently shorter than in southern parts of Britain , and the ‘ timing factor’ for breeding birds is that much more critical .",0

"The question remains as to whether the register of charges maintained by the Registrar of Companies accurately reflects the extent of the incumbrances on a company 's property . Although not exhaustively comprehensive , it does give a reasonably accurate picture and its most serious defects arise not from the register as such but because English law lacks a satisfactory system for classifying personal property security interests . Also , at the end of the day it is arguable that all that the register needs to show are the principal charges over the company 's property since anyone dealing with the company can seek to find out the full extent to which the company 's property has been charged once put on notice that some charges have been created . There is always the chance that the company will not give honest answers but the extent to which debtor dishonesty is a danger should not be exaggerated .

"It was not a contest to excite the audience and there must have been some anxiety in Mason 's corner as it approached a critical stage .

Despite being out - jabbed , the British champion kept boring forward and when he got inside , taking punches in order to do so , he landed some solid right hooks to the head and the body . There was never much conviction in the way Biggs fought , his attitude more that of a man boxing from memory rather than one attempting to resurrect a shattered career , and Mason was never persuaded that genuine peril might result from exchanges in the middle of the ring .",0

"So it is good to have these idiomatic recordings to remind us of just how good a pianist he was : in both the Concerto and the Rhapsody , rock - solid technique serves real musicality , and this CD would be worth acquiring on the strength of the Gershwin works alone . In the Concerto especially , both soloist and conductor take the work entirely seriously , and make a substantial case for it as one of the leading Concertos of its time — the days are leaving us at least when Gershwin 's ' serious ' works ( those are n't my scare quotes ) were treated like the fortuitous good fortune of the upstart seven - year - old playing in big brother 's room , as if he composed them by accident . The Rhapsody , too , is given a strong , swaggering but solid reading from that famous opening clarinet Glissando onwards ( it began its life , by the way , as a bit of tongue - in - cheek rehearsal mischief from Ross Gorman , the clarinettist of the Whiteman band ; the delighted Gershwin insisted on retaining it ) . Lewenthal 's and Danon 's performances , now ( my goodness ! ) thirty years old , were recorded in the teeth of the dehaut - enbas prejudice of the day and , although their earnest approach loses a little spontaneity in the making of their point , they must have taken some of Gershwin 's critics by the scruff of their ears . So what of the make - weights , as the presentation suggests we consider them ?",0

"The fifth case belonged to a different category : a gentleman named Thomas Arundell was given leave to demise a tenement and three yardlands which he presumably treated as an investment .

"Instead , the work should consider what has culturally negotiated this experience for the artist and for other women whose personal experiences so closely echo her own .

In this , I was indebted to the work of Jo Spense , Judith Williamson , Jo Lambert and Jane Beckett 1 .

"This was set as the minimum for contributions to the first loan , in 1522 , men of less substance being let on until , perhaps , the yield had proved disappointing . In the subsidy goods of this value were taxed at 10 per cent for the first two years , the same rate as for land , the owners of which were mostly drawn from the wealthier strata , and double what was levied on smaller assessments . In the range £ 20 — £ 39 a clear majority of people were taxed on goods , many not owning any land at all , and since personal property at this level was insufficient to confer gentry status , members of the group occupied an intermediate position , lacking on the one hand the landed property necessary for gentlemen ; they were , on the other hand , judged competent to pay tax at the same rate as gentlemen , making them men of undeniable substance in comparison with the rank and file of country folk . The consensus of opinion , nevertheless , was that the fundamental demarcation occurred at £ 40 . Fiscally it signified little , for the total tax liability ( inclusive of the loan payment ) remained unaltered at 20 per cent , though there is the important social difference that from this point the proportion of subsidy assessments on landed incomes increases sharply .",0

I do n't want to exaggerate it , because on the complex issues , however determined or single - minded a Prime Minister is , they have to discuss things with an inner group of colleagues .",0
"Such conflicts are generally not in the long - term interests of either party : the deterioration in the investment climate adversely affects the interests of both parties . This research project examines the contractual relationships between oil companies and Governments in the UK , Norway , Denmark and the Netherlands since the early 1970s . The main purpose is to investigate the relevant legislation and regulations with a view to determining the extent to which the terms are inherently unstable in the context of the objectives of the two parties within a changing economic and political environment . The object is then to discover the form and structure of contractual relationships which are likely to be more robust and stable within this changing environment . The research encompasses licensing , taxation and depletion policies .",0
"This is what it was all about , to push the Germans back , mile by mile , no matter how long or what dreadful toll it might take , until they were safely confined behind their own boundaries again .

"If we now introduce the idea that the control and management of this bridge , including its finances , were in the hands of periodically - elected local politicians , the system appears in sharper relief . For the community , the bridge is a good thing but the taxes are bad . The borrowing facility severs the relationship between the two things : it allows the community to have all the good things but in the short run to suffer a much smaller amount of the bad . In extremis , if the community defaulted on the debt , the relationship would be completely severed . But as long as the politicians are forced to levy annual taxes to make annual debt repayments , there is some control over their fiscal integrity .",0

"While Mulroney appeared to represent the former when he was elected , he has in fact turned out to be of the latter kind , and that exposed position may also have contributed to his loss of support . His government overhauled the world 's seventh largest economy by privatising state firms , launching a hated value - added tax and signing a pioneering free trade agreement with the US . But prolonged recession and high unemployment knocked his popularity down to rock - bottom . One of his main political objectives was to negotiate a constitutional settlement which would satisfy both the people of the French - speaking province of Quebec and the rest of Canada .

"Given this , it is no longer possible for the rate of interest to ensure equality between planned saving and planned investment and so Say 's Law will no longer hold .

This means that in a situation where saving exceeds investment , so that aggregate demand is less than the total value of production , firms will reduce output and lay off workers .

"In a series of flashbacks , we follow the pair through their teenage years , their weekly visits to the dreamscape of the pictures , the real - life dramas of school , family , dances and boys , rehearsals with the Staneyburn Amateur Dramatic and Light Operatic Society ( another fantasy - world ) and the gradual intrusion of realities black - and - white in the technicolor of their aspirations . Lochhead 's script is a joy , depicting through its energetic vernacular dialogue the texture of small - town Scottish life in the period , when girls carried bottles of Evening in Paris in their knickers and were in love with Montgomery Clift ; when the pictures cost 1/9d and the Locarno Ballroom on Sauchiehall Street was the place to be on a Saturday night , while at home fathers sat taciturn in armchairs , not listening to their wives . Vivienne Brown and Ann Scott - Jones as Dorothy and Dienne bring the right mixture of exuberance and shrewd female pragmatism to their roles , deftly conveying a sense of life lived , half - knowingly on two levels . Malcolm Murray 's effective staging allows the time switches to take place with admirable smoothness , and Jimmy Chisholm as the narcissistic am - dram director extracts maximum comedy for the character without milking it . The main problem , at least on the first night , was that too much of the dialogue was overplayed — Lochhead recognises that you do n't need to soup up the Scots speech to make it funny , or poignant or significant : it 's all already there in the words , but if they 're spoken too self - consciously they end up sounding like rather forced one - liners .",1

"Nizan himself expressed it more simply : "" The major problems consist in infusing art with the spirit of revolution without destroying art in the process . "" When Nizan highlights the technically advantageous position of the writer who portrays a society of stability , and at the same time stresses the desirability and the necessity for the contemporary writer to engage fully in a portrayal of the political instability of post-1914 French society in its turbulent actuality , he locates with unerring precision the revolutionary writer 's primary dilemma . This dilemma is given prominence in the distinction that Nizan draws between "" balance - sheet novels "" ( "" romans - bilan "" ) , which take stock of a finalised historical period , and "" problem - centred novels "" ( "" romans - probleme "" ) which focus on contemporary issues .

"I am not persuaded either My Lords that the inclusion of nominated members with special skills will add very much to the police authorities decision making , bearing in mind the experience already there , which has been referred to earlier in this debate .

Certainly the minimum of one - and - a - half days per month envisaged by the Home Office as being all that will be required , it seems to me to be very wide of the mark . I agree with the Lord of Aberdale that it is vital for the elected representatives on the police authority to be clearly seen to be in the driving seat of the committee .

"This comes in the wake of a Labour Party survey showing fundholders nationally making profits as high as £ 100,000 and being given four times the amount non - fundholders are for spending on computers .

The existing 13 practices will be joined by 20 others by the start of next month and a further 25 are preparing to take the plunge in a year 's time . That will mean fundholding GPs covering more than 14 per cent of the county 's population .

"' Before the reign of James the Fifth , a Highland Laird made a trial of his wife for a certain time , and if she did not please him , he was then at liberty to send her away ' — which is exactly what took place when a Macdonald married a Macleod .

"Thus , there are many forms of communication that horses use , from body language to empathy . Nevertheless , they are rarely used individually and to the exclusion of all other forms of communication , so they need to be considered all together ; each form of communication adding a little more to the message the horse is sending . However , this is all rather analytical and intellectual ; and if we ourselves can only function on this rational level , our communication with horses will be no better than a tourist who needs a phrase book or dictionary in a foreign country . From our point of view , empathy is the most valuable form of communication with the horse , for we not only have insight into how the horse feels , but we intuitively understand the horse 's other forms of communication , like verbal messages and body language .

"Cross - references to this appendix are given by italic numbers,(eg 16 ) From Joseph Conrad , The Secret Sharer On my right hand there were lines of fishing - stakes resembling a mysterious system of half - submerged bamboo fences , incomprehensible in its division of the domain of tropical fishes , and crazy of aspect as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen now gone to the other end of the ocean ; for there was no sign of human habitation as far as the eye could reach ( 1 ) . To the left a group of barren islets , suggesting ruins of stone walls , towers and block houses , had its foundations set in a blue sea that itself looked solid , so still and stable did it lie below my feet ; even the track of light from the westering sun shone smoothly , without that animated glitter which tells of an imperceptible ripple ( 2 ) . And when I turned my head to take a parting glance at the tug which had just left us anchored outside the bar , I saw the straight line of the flat shore joined to the stable sea , edge to edge , with a perfect and unmarked closeness , in one levelled floor half brown , half blue under the enormous dome of the sky ( 3 ) . Corresponding in their insignificance to the islets of the sea , two small clumps of trees , one on each side of the only fault in the impeccable joint , marked the mouth of the river Meinam we had just left on the first preparatory stage of our homeward journey ; and , far back on the inland level , a larger and loftier mass , the grove surrounding the great Paknam pagoda , was the only thing on which the eye could rest from the vain task of exploring the monotonous sweep of the horizon ( 4 ) . Here and there gleams as of a few scattered pieces of silver marked the windings of the great river ; and on the nearest of them , just within the bar , the tug steaming right into the land became lost to my sight , hull and funnel and masts , as though the impassive earth had swallowed her up without an effort , without a tremor ( 5 ) .",1

With business confidence in Manila at rock bottom , President Aquino is in a specially weak position ; power shortages and blackouts are crippling manufacturing industry , and oil sanctions because of the Gulf crisis are exacerbating her problems .

"In practice , teaching the working - class to understand moral law usually meant an Old Testament affirmation of the preordained retribution which followed in the wake of sinfulness .

' While the working - class was the principal target for purists ' interventionary zeal they also provided rank - and - file recruits for the new movement .

"As soon as it becomes clear that the new attacks would not achieve their objectives within a reasonable period , then we must abandon them and ‘ seek a decision elsewhere’ said Falkenhayn half - heartedly , adding : Our chances of ending the war quickly would certainly be greatly increased if the battle were won ; but if we failed to win it , even after what had already been achieved , our victory would merely be postponed and not rendered impossible , especially if we resolved in good time not to persist with our useless efforts at Verdun , but to take the initiative of attack elsewhere . To an Army Commander , plunged up to the hilt by his superior in the most desperate battle of the war , this last can have provided little of encouragement or inspiration .

"In their work on the Labour Spain Committee they conclude : The party 's identification with the cause of the Spanish Republic was never translated into practical aid for winning the war . whether possible or not , it was never contemplated The Labour party leadership failed consistently to put principle into practice , while the rank - and - file opposition to party politics , as expressed by the Labour Spain Committee , confused imperatives and failed to effect a radical change of policy . Watkins comes to a similar conclusion , although he argues that the Labour Party 's hostility to working with the Communist Party was the reason for its failure to force the National government to abandon its non - intervention policy . These criticisms are , in many respects , justified although it would seem a bit far - fetched for historians to believe that the Labour Party , even in alliance with the Communist Party , could have forced a National government with an overwhelming parliamentary majority , to have capitulated to external pressure .",0

"For simplicity , we assume that existing plant has a maximum capacity of Q units of output and the SMC is constant at the level c up to full capacity and then becomes vertical . No matter how much is spent , output can not be increased beyond Q given the existing level of plant or capital capacity . Since SMC measures the marginal social opportunity cost in the short run of the resources used to produce this good , price should be set at SMC to equate marginal social cost and marginal social benefit . Thus if demand is low the industry should produce Q 1 and will operate at less than full capacity .

"In particular , the determination of the SDLP and the republic 's government to put on the north - south , ‘ strand two’ table the 1920 Government of Ireland Act establishing partition makes unionists very jittery . For if the act is put in question then so is subsequent British legislation , as well as article one of the Anglo - Irish Agreement , which enshrine the principle that there can be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without majority consent . Equally , the insistence by Mr Molyneaux that there can be no distinction between the treatment of Northern Ireland and any ( highly limited and purely administrative ) devolution conceded to Scotland , when Mr Major finally ‘ takes stock’ , rules out any power - sharing or north - south ‘ Irish dimension’— minimum requirements for the SDLP .

"Subjects correctly recalled a mean of 4.9 junctions each ( min 2 , max 8) . Some junctions were clearly recalled more often than others ( Cochran 's Q=220.5 , df=39 , p<0.01 ) , ranging from junction 17 , entering a dual carriageway from a slip road , which was correctly recalled by 14 of the 28 subjects to 11 junctions which were never correctly recalled . Seven of these 11 were junctions at which the driver had simply gone straight ahead past a minor road . To see which variables were related to a subject recalling a junction , point biserial correlations were calculated with each junction being scored as a 1 for a subject that recalled it and 0 for a subject that did not .

"This reinforces the view , developed in the previous chapter , that manufacturing industry in particular is following the Armed Forces in relying more and more on fit , skilled , mobile workers . Psychometrically the problem is to develop appropriate descriptive taxonomies so that a person 's actual or potential contribution to an organisation is succinctly expressible . These remain primitive in that , on the whole , non - technical English is used with all the possibilities of ambiguity and communication at cross purposes which this implies . The accountants are ahead of the psychologists in developing ideas such as profit centres applicable to small groups or even to individuals . The increased awareness of the importance of the individual worker to profit and success generally , particularly at higher levels in the organisation , has stimulated the growth of a specialist placement profession colloquially known as the head hunters .",0

He had a few weeks to bask in the glow of this last electoral achievement , weeks that were only a little marred by the unpleasantness of Cabinet changes and the difficulties of moving towards a decision on the application of the oil sanction against Italy . Then , in the middle weeks of December , Baldwin 's reputation took the sharpest plunge , to its lowest point , of his whole active career . The Foreign Secretary he had appointed only six months previously , had for some weeks been as exhausted in health as he had become weak on Italian sanctions .

"This criticism would not be valid if anomie analysis were applied to corporate crime . For the one characteristic organization theorists ( Blau and Scott 1962 ; Etzioni 1961 ; Parsons 1963 ) agree on is that corporations , like all organizations , are primarily orientated towards the achievement of a particular goal — profit — at least in the long run . In the short run , other goals , such as growth through acquisition or increased market share may be emphasized . Diversification , particularly into potentially competing industries might become a preferred short - term stratagem . For instance , the American oil industry has fairly recently expanded into the solar , sea , and wind energy industries so that in the long run competition between alternative forms of energy can be regulated .",0
"First party competition will generate "" excessive "" expectations in the electorate . Second , the electorate will have every incentive to vote for more government services because they do not pay for them directly and individual tax payments may bear little ( if any ) relationship to the benefits which they may derive from such services . In other words , the system of competitive vote bidding acts like a ratchet encouraging ever more government services at the same time as it penalises a government prepared to take "" tough "" decisions that may hit particular interests in the short run even though these decisions may work to the advantage of all in the longer run . Moreover , the higher taxes that are an inevitable counterpart of more government services not only act as a disincentive to saving and investment , but also "" overload "" the economy and crowd out opportunities for economic growth at the same time as the opening up of export markets and the defence of the home market is made ever more difficult by the inevitable inflation . Although the government has to operate within the context of the economic realities of the day and "" should "" have regard to the long - term interests of the economy as a whole , critics of adversary politics point out that a short - term concern for vote maximisation at the next general election is never far from the government 's mind and this conditions the way in which it manages the economy and makes economic policy .",0
"This may have been the same object as that lent by Gaston I to Clement V. The pope agreed to keep the talisman safely and to excommuni - cate anyone else who attempted to use it .

"The incidence of rent and labour strikes and land seizures from private landowners rose during the 1890s . Serious crop failure in 1901 was followed by major peasant uprisings during 1902 in the Ukraine , the Volga area , and Georgia . Peasant protest , both in the countryside and among the rank and file in the army , played a major part in the revolution of 1905 . Although the peasantry continued to account for over 80 per cent of the population , discontent among the urban poor and especially the industrial working class was of scarcely less significance than the unrest in the countryside . By the turn of the century , some two million men and women , rather less than 5 per cent of the working population , were employed in mines and factories .",0

"The ability of party leaders to manipulate the nomination process had been substantially undercut , however , by party reform . Nominating procedures were now more open and participatory than they had ever been before . Rules changes had transformed the Democratic National Convention into a body much more representative of minorities and the rank - and - file . And , most important of all , the number of states using primary elections to select delegates to the convention had risen from 17 in 1968 to 29 in 1976 , with the number of votes cast by delegates chosen or bound by primaries increasing from 37.5 per cent to 72.6 per cent . In these new circumstances of ‘ open parties’ and ‘ participatory politics’it became possible for outsiders to seize nominations irrespective of the wishes of party leaders , and Jimmy Carter proved to be just such a candidate .",0

"In so far as top businessmen play a decisive role in company strategy — as distinct from its public presentation — the talents they need will vary from one situation to another . The kind of entrepreneur required in a new and expanding industry is likely to be somewhat different from the one required to handle the contraction and reorganisation of an old staple industry . ' Horses for courses ' in this context implies that entrepreneurial ( and managerial ) mobility is at . Least as important as its initial recruitment . Not surprisingly , therefore , entrepreneurs and managers can become locked into an existing company structure which may perform not particularly well but adequately enough to survive , or to survive while its position is steadily being undermined by import penetration .",0
"Now my opinion is , is that was the first stage of the government 's master plan to create a health service that would be ripe for privatization . Back in nineteen eighty eight the government faced a massive crash cash crisis in N H S funding , and er many people within the trade union movement took part in a massive rally in London to call on the government to review its policy towards the , the Health Service . Many of us at that time welcomed the fact that the government was taking stock of public opinion , and was t making the effort to review the , the , the N H S. But unfortunately what that review meant was that what the review brought about was a near privatization of the Health Service through the government 's N H S White Paper and subsequently the N H S and Community Care Act . The privileges of that Act went to the very heart of the N H S.",0

Brown had fallen miserably in love ( so he said ) with a girl named Betty Fowler , whom he 'd met one Friday evening at a hop held in the Oxford Town Hall , and already on their second meeting they had vowed a mutual , eternal love . Then , when the war ended in the summer of 1945 , after being demobbed from Germany , he 'd gone straight back to the US , with no possible hope of any real communication between them except for one or two impermanent and unreliable addresses . So , slowly , the memories of their idyllic times together had faded .

"No - one could question the diligence of Maxwell Fyfe , Soskice , or Brooke as Home Secretary , but their reputations have suffered grievously from lack of vision and flair .

"Waltham , Massachusetts - based BGS Systems Inc allied with IBM Corp to provide global worldwide workload management and planning services for the Unix market : BGS will supply BEST 1 , a software product for performance and capacity management , to IBM for use in providing management and capacity planning . IBM AND BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE IBM Corp and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp were yesterday due to launch their joint venture to market systems for duplicating audio compact disk recordings in retail stores : the idea is that record companies could eliminate the need to press hundreds of thousands of copies of major recordings — instead the store would tap into central databases at each record company to collect the tracks requested and record them onto a blank disk ; although no pilot systems have yet been launched , IBM said the system also could be used to make and sell computer software and video games on demand ; the IBM - Blockbuster system is expected to be designed to distribute albums in original form , rather than enabling customers to mix and match their choice of tracks , and negotiations are reportedly already under way with several record companies ; a typical CD would take about six minutes to make , complete with the glossy packaging buyers expect .

"The single most difficult skill for the calligrapher to acquire is consistently good letterform in a rhythmic , written hand .

The stranger to calligraphy may be struck by the fact that none of these cards displays the florid illumination characteristic of the 15th century Books of Hours made so familiar to us by countless commercial reproductions on christmas cards advertised widely in small format ' gift ' catalogues . The is partly due to the length of time such illumination takes — there Books of Hours were never conceived as ephemera — and partly because calligraphers today are not seeking to satisfy 15th century tastes .

"If it is 3 % , the required increase in annual tax revenues rises to $ 1.5~billion a year . If it is 5 % , the government will need an additional $ 2.5~billion per year . Assuming that continued subnormal output casts a 10 % shadow on future potential output levels , that extra $ 150~billion of production means that in the future , when the economy has recovered , there will be an extra $ 15~billion of output – and an extra $ 5~billion of tax revenue . Governments will not have to raise taxes to finance extra debt taken on to fund fiscal boosts . Instead , the supply - side boost to potential output over the long run from expansionary fiscal policy would be highly likely not only to pay for the additional debt needed to finance the spending boost , but also to allow for additional future tax cuts while still balancing the budget .",1

"Hence it is fairly clear that Cnut , who received the name Lambert at his baptism , was a Christian when he acquired the English throne , and the same was probably true of most of his major followers . Certainly , some were later prepared to patronise English churches . On the other hand , the rank and file of his army of conquest of 1016 , comprising Norwegians and Swedes as well as Danes , doubtless contained a fair number of heathens , and it is very unlikely that the Danish church had yet permeated national life as deeply as that of the English . In particular , Cnut , unlike William the Conqueror , whose Norman duchy contained a vigorous church , was not in a position to start replacing English personnel with continentals on any scale . In matters of religion he was largely obliged to play an English game , with English men , and by English rules .",0

"Altogether Eliot , who later offered his services to the Ministry of Information , which was founded on 5 September , two days after the outbreak of war , believed that a great deal could meanwhile be done by way of the spoken and written word .

I could see that he was sceptical of our diplomatic capacity to do so ; and when , later , Chamberlain despatched a female relation to ' negotiate ' with Mussolini , it became clear that his misgivings were justified .

"Before the passing of the 1980 Act certain decisions of this court , in particular Wallis ' Cayton Bay Holiday Camp Ltd v Shellmex and BP Ltd [ 1974]3 All ER 575 and Gray v Wykeham - Martin [ 1977]CA Transcript 10A were thought to have established a general doctrine that in one special type of case there would be implied in favour of the would - be adverse possessor , without any specific factual basis for such implication , a licence permitting him to commit the acts of possession on which he sought to rely ; the effect of implying such a licence would , of course , be to prevent the squatter 's possession from being "" adverse "" . That special type of case was broadly one where the acts of an intruder , however continuous and far - reaching , did not substantially interfere with any plans which the owners might have for the future use of undeveloped land … On any footing , it must , in my judgment , be too broad a proposition to suggest that an owner who retains a piece of land with a view to its utilisation for a specific purpose in the future can never be treated as dispossessed , however firm and obvious the intention and however drastic the act of dispossession of the person seeking to dispossess him may be . Furthermore , while it may well be correct to say that the implied licence doctrine ( so long as it survived ) itself involved the "" adaptation "" of the literal application of the statutory provisions "" to meet one special type of case "" , I do not think it correct that the [ old]decisions … authorise or justify an application of the statutory provisions otherwise than in accordance with their ordinary and natural meaning … If in any given case the land in dispute is unbuilt land and the squatter is aware that the owner , while having no present use for it , has a purpose in mind for its use in the future , the court is likely to require very clear evidence before it can be satisfied that the squatter who claims a possessory title has not only established factual possession of the land , but also the requisite intention to exclude the world at large , including the owner with the paper title , so far as is reasonably practicable and so far as the processes of the law will allow .",0

It was hard for the men not to lose their footing on jagged or slippery stones : harder still , leaning right back on the ropes , to counteract the relentless downward pull of the current and keep the tree on course for the opposite bank . When both trunks had been hauled on to the far bank they used the ropes to bind them together at various points along their length .

"In his precisely delineated observation of the world , Calvino 's Palomar is an emblematic figure of recent Italian fiction . Neither a sociological nor a psychological type , he represents an assemblage of mental attitudes , providing a kind of vade - mecum and at the same time an ironic counterpoint to the anxieties of a public that is presumed by the book itself to have lost faith in totalizing explanations and englobing narratives . In the face of such a generalization , it is worth pausing for a moment to take stock of the kind of observer that Palomar is not . Stefano Tani has already pointed out that Calvino 's idea of observation , within his wider poetic of ‘ seeing’ , is a different matter from the ‘ impassive and indifferent , basically blind , gaze that we have inherited from the nouveau roman’ . Calvino 's , and Palomar 's , gaze , on the contrary , is interrogatory , teasing out the meaning of things , impartial but never impersonal or ‘ inert’(Tani 1986 : 122 , 124 ) .",0

"Economists like to point out that solvency has little to do with the ratio of public debt to today ’s GDP , and much to do with debt relative to expected future tax revenues . A government ’s solvency thus depends much more on long - term growth prospects than on the current debt / GDP ratio . A reduction in the deficit today might lead in the short run to a fall in GDP that is larger than the cut in the deficit ( if the so - called multiplier is larger than one ) , which would cause the debt / GDP ratio to rise . But almost all economic models imply that a cut in expenditures today should lead to higher GDP in the long run , because it allows for lower taxes ( and thus reduces economic distortions ) . Austerity should thus always be beneficial for solvency in the long run , even if the debt / GDP ratio deteriorates in the short run .",0
"Another modification introduced in 1992 was that any business which moved into new premises would inherit the transitional relief ( i.e. the phasing in allowance ) of the previous occupant . In the original scheme a new occupier did not get any relief of this kind . As can be seen , the problems faced by UK industry during the protracted recession of the early 1990s caused the government to introduce a series of ad - hoc measures to help industry minimize the effects of the UBR , at least in the short run . The UBR also represented a change in that the ‘ poundage rate’ under this scheme was now set by central government and not by the local authority . Although the local authorities actually collect the UBR , the receipts are paid into a central fund outside local authority control .",0

"Similarly , the war provided a receptive atmosphere for a reappraisal of the economic and recreational role of the countryside . By 1941 L. F. Easterbrook , the agricultural expert and journalist , associated with Lloyd George 's plan for the land , was urging through the pages of Picture Post the need for a ‘ Land Commission’ which would operate a national strategy to apportion land for agriculture , forestry , building , roads , allotments , factories , playing fields and national parks , while others supported the demand for public access to the countryside and the creation of specially designated areas as ‘ lungs’for the urban areas . The Scott report , published in 1942 , urged the setting up of a planning system embracing the countryside as well as the town , mainly with a view to preserving the best agricultural land from urban development , but also recommending the setting up of national parks . Following the appointment of the first Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1943 , the government committed itself to create National Parks . The issue of control of land use remained more contentious ; a White Paper on the control of land use was shelved by the coalition government and not dealt with until the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 under the post - war Labour administration .",0

( This was a circumstance paralleled at his own funeral , when the friends and relations of the woman he 'd been living with for part of the week since the early 1960s stole the show from us , the pathetic huddle of the family of his middle years . ) My mother 's story on the other hand was told to me much earlier , in bits and pieces throughout the fifties , and it was n't delivered to entertain but rather to teach me lessons .",0

"EIRE 's rapidly growing catering industry still has plenty of room for investment , according to a report published by the country 's National Food Centre .

"The ‘ combat’ called for here would certainly have been ‘ risky’for it would have led inevitably to the destruction of both the Republican party and the Reagan administration .

"Joining the Army at 17-and - a - half , the young Whittingham was really only interested in playing sport for fun .

That attracted Pompey , and Whittingham explained : ‘ I decided to buy myself out for £ 450 and take the plunge — I 'm glad to say Portsmouth did pay me back the money — and I 've never really looked back . ‘ If I 'd started at 17 or 18 , who knows what I might have achieved . ‘ But I have no regrets .",0

"Or if you have a number of outstanding debts , such as credit card charges and hire purchase deals , a remortgage can pay them all off at a much lower rate of interest to help you reduce your outgoings . When you remortgage , you automatically lose any of the tax advantages you may have enjoyed from dual tax relief . If you are claiming this , when you remortgage , you will only receive tax relief on the first £ 30,000 — a loss worth considering before you take the plunge . Tax relief is only granted on the part of the remortgage that is used to buy a property . Therefore , if you had a £ 20,000 mortgage and wanted to raise a further £ 8,000 for home improvements , you could only claim tax relief on the first £ 20,000 .",0
"THE Western Tour commenced at Winnipeg , where we experienced four days of temperature ranging from -28C to -35C. And although the hospitality was superb , we were relieved to move to the warmer climate of Vancouver and Vancouver Island . As we thawed out so our curling improved , which stood us in good stead when the tour progressed into the curling hotbed regions of Edmonton , Weyburn , Saskatoon and Calgary . Nevertheless , playing against Canadian Province champions and , on one occasion against former world champion Ed Northcott , resulted in severe erosion of the lead we had built up earlier . Also , the curling schedule of close on two matches per day , coupled with extensive travelling , proved exhausting , and in Calgary we welcomed the pleasant break of a day visit into the Rockies to Lake Louise and Banff — winter wonderlands of snow and ice .",0

"In this case , however , though the style is recognizably Hitlerian ( apart from the accompanying specific instructions for implementing the boycott , which seem to have been composed by Goebbels ) , the ‘ appeal’ was signed collectively by ‘ the Party Leadership’ . No one , of course , could have imagined that the boycott was proceeding without Hitler 's express support . But the wording of the ‘ appeal’ couched the action solely in terms of justifiable retaliation for the ‘ campaign of agitation’and ‘ lies’in the foreign press allegedly initiated by Jewish emigrants , and the claim that ‘ hardly a hair had been touched’on Jewish heads in the course of the ‘ national revolution’was meant to suggest that the Party Leadership ( including Hitler ) was ignorant of the daily maltreatment of Jews which had taken place at the hands of the Party rank - and - file . It was possible , therefore , so far as Hitler was specifically linked to the boycott at all , to see him only in connection with presumed justifiable action , and detached from the ‘ unfortunate excesses’ of Party activists . As is well known , the boycott was less than a resounding success in terms of popular reactions , and , as an organized nation - wide affair , was called off after only a single day .",0

He subsequently claimed that the Soviet Union had received great support during these meetings for its readiness to take part ‘ in multilateral talks among all states which use the waters of the Indian Ocean with a view to formulating guarantees of the safety of maritime lines of communication , including the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz , as well as guarantees of the littoral states’ sovereignty over their natural resources’ .

Since then , around seven hundred Arabs have been killed and thousands more injured ; but when one Palestinian falls there 's always another ready to take their place . Israel 's well - equipped military has managed to keep a lid on the uprising degenerating into chaos , but it has n't defeated the armies of stone - throwing youths . More than a million and a half Palestinians live in the occupied territories , their treatment prompted repeated accusations by western governments as well as those in the Middle East , that Israel 's crackdown has been too harsh , at times undisciplined ; one image of violence by Israeli forces aroused world - wide condemnation . The situation in the Gulf may now dwarf the Palestinian issue , but no Middle East crisis can be seen in isolation ; a thousand days of protest has assured the plight of Palestinians has rarely been off the world agenda .",0

"Hence he envisages that for every sphere of public- or private - sector activity there should be established some arena of potentially destabilising and broadly - based conflict over the use of that power . Perhaps the most novel aspect of this proposal is its recognition of a category of destabilisation rights , to be enforced by ambitious forms of injunctive relief , which would afford an opportunity for individuals and interests to challenge and disrupt established institutions or forms of social practice which had achieved immunity from conventional legal and political measures of control . Rather more modestly , but perhaps more realistically , some British public lawyers are now also beginning to explore alternative institutional forms to the traditional English representative model of politics , with a view to involving broader constituencies in the decision - making process ( Lewis and Harden , 1982 ) . One of the devices thought to have the best potential for ensuring participation in policy - making is the American administrative law initiative of ‘ hybrid rule - making’ . This has the advantage over our conventional representative institutions of being based on a new model of decision - making , one which seeks to ensure adequate consideration of all competing interests , including even poorly organised ones .",0

"By November 1944 , only the Bristol 167 and the Type 2 aircraft , the twin - engine Airspeed 67 , had gone much past the preliminary design stage , and the Brabazon Committee warned that the five new types would face obsolescence if their development were not speeded up . Part of the problem was the less than perfect relationship between the Air Ministry and BOAC , which would have to operate the new aircraft . BOAC clearly had profit on its mind , and wanted its requirements incorporated into the new designs , but these were only partially met . In October 1944 , Lord Knollys , the BOAC chairman , told a meeting held in the Ministry of Aircraft production that the Brabazon Type 3 would be the airline 's ‘ bread and butter’ aircraft for Empire routes , carrying twenty - five sleepers or forty to forty - five day passengers . It was to be a four - engine aircraft , possibly with gas turbines , with a range of 2,750 miles .",0

"This last point raises a fundamental question about the nature and function of standing rules . There is a sense in which standing is a preliminary question , separate from that of the substance and merits of the applicant 's case : standing rules determine entitlement to raise and argue the issue of illegality , and it makes little sense to say that entitlement to argue the merits of the case depends on whether one has a good case on the merits . Only if the chance of failure at the end of the day approaches certainty should the likely outcome affect the question of access to the court . But this argument assumes that there is some value in separating the issue of entitlement to apply for judicial review from the question of entitlement to a remedy at the end of the day . A counter - argument might be that standing rules are just one mechanism for weeding out hopeless or frivolous cases at an early stage and protecting government bodies ( rightly or wrongly ) from harassment by ‘ professional litigants’(who else would expend the time and resources necessary to mount a hopeless case ? ) meddling in matters which do not really concern them .",0

"At the conclusion of the second world climate conference , held in Geneva on Nov. 5 - 7 , the 137 participating governments signed an agreement which recognized that global warming was a reality and undertook to take steps to limit it .

Negotiations on the convention were scheduled to begin in February 1991 , with a view to reaching agreement in time for the 1992 environment and development conference in Brazil . Agreement had been delayed by a reluctance on the part of major oil - producing states , led by Saudi Arabia , the Soviet Union and the United States to agree to set firm targets for limiting greenhouse gas emissions .

"After assembling at Waddington , Sugar was flown to Bovington in Hertfordshire on February 10 to visit the US 8th Air Force Headquarters at High Wycombe , where the crew were warmly received , and then started its tour of the bases . Cecil recalls that one of the bases was Great Ashfield and other Woodbridge , one of the three emergency strips located on the east coast , Cecil particularly recalling the very long runway there . Most of the airfields were bomber units , with the exception of Debden in Essex , a Mustang base , where they were talked down by the American Ground Controllers after exercising around in fog for some time . After her return to operations , Sugar 's first trip was to Wurzburg on March 16/17 , followed by another on 20/21 , this time again piloted by Laurie Baker on a 1,560 mile trip to attack the Bohlen oil works , where they met only moderate defences . The new Squadron CO , W / C H A Hay , decided to take Sugar on her next operation which was to Bremen to attack a railway bridge that was vital to enemy communications , a daylight operation on the 22nd .",1
"Think you if I permitted you to join your brother now , that you would be permitted to return ? Alas my innocent lamb !

"I had to help Uncle fetch the coal for us and some corn oats for Prince the colt , and a mare which was in foal . We used a sledge with Prince pulling it along . And it was going downhill over the hard packed snow which was the worst bit , with me acting as a brake , hauling on a rope to keep the sledge from running forward into the horse 's heels . The sheep had the worst time , and not many survived 1947 , although provisions for people and animals alike were dropped in by helicopter , and the Army forced a way through on the south side of the dale . The hardships produced a wonderful spirit in the community .",1
"In a typically British way , we have failed to take the credit that is due to us for that achievement , which had its origins in the Kangaroo group of Members of the European Parliament founded by the late Basil de Ferranti specifically to break down the trade barriers that existed in Europe at a time when none of the other major Community partners wanted to know anything about it . They rested secure behind their trade barriers , and it was above all a British initiative that led to the creation of the single European market . After advancing at a snail 's pace for many years , we suddenly find ourselves invited to participate in a Gadarene rush towards economic and political union . I have always believed in the cause of European unity . It was the issue that first brought me into active politics as long ago as 1964 .",0
"In contrast , the lime - kilns at Brampton and Droitwich were perhaps concerned with the construction of the defences . These two examples can hardly represent the total number which originally existed , although lime may have been produced in small , temporary clamps which have not survived later destruction .

"The work of Miliutin and Reitern made plain that the Russian government retained its commitment to reform even in the immediate aftermath of the emancipation . Having addressed themselves to the army and the treasury , the authorities turned to the Orthodox Church . Ecclesiastical dignitaries had been contemplating certain reforms of their own , but pressure for a radical approach to the church 's problems had been generated by a rank - and - file priest and by laymen . The priest , Ivan Belliustin , devoted a lengthy manuscript to the wretched lives of the non - monastic clergy . Their education , he said , was irrelevant to their duties , their poverty such that they had to spend most of their time keeping body and soul together .",0

"Natural behaviour can mean one of two things . Either it refers to behaviour which does not have to be learned or it refers to behaviour which has been so thoroughly learned that it can be done ‘ naturally’ , ie without conscious thought and application . Natural behaviours in the first sense are few and far between ( see Instincts on page 93 ) since the majority of human behaviour has been acquired through an ad hoc learning process . The second meaning is therefore more applicable and this equates so - called natural behaviour with skilled behaviour . All natural behaviour has , therefore , become so by going through a stage of being unnatural .",0

He recalls vividly being told shortly after he took the job at Fawley refinery that an Esso director would be calling to see him . He had to ask what exactly a director was . But the lessons he learned from those formative years were to stand him in good stead later on when he was to understand what it meant to be a director from first - hand experience . When I was put in charge of the start - up at Fawley at the ripe old age of twenty - nine most of my team were people who were twenty years older than I was and being on shift with a lot of operating people taught me the problems and the realisation that I could learn a hell of a lot from them — the realisation that the chap on the shop floor usually knows far more about what 's going on than management does . It also taught him the importance of training .,0

"Part , at least , of Ho 's enlightenment was the approximation and future projection of political power in Vietnam , the need to maintain the appeal to Vietnamese patriotism , and , most of all , a temporary but overwhelming necessity for Chinese support . By the rime Ho had been released by the Chinese in September 1943 the US was beginning to make its major contribution to the war against Japan and various strategies were being considered for a drive on Canton or Hanoi . In either case principally Chinese armies would have been involved and , in the short run at least , Vietnam 's political future seemed to lie in Chinese hands . The Chinese , for their part , needed reliable intelligence on conditions in Vietnam — some genuine Vietnamese support , too , if they could get it — but not simply that which was promised by émigrés who had lived in China for years and who had little or no contact with or contemporary knowledge of Vietnam . While he was in Chinese captivity , and apart from writing poems in classical Chinese ( some of which , while they may not have been of the highest order classically , are nevertheless moving and rather beautiful ) Ho had also translated Dr Sun Yat Sen 's modern political classic the San Min Chu I into Vietnamese and this expedient flattery of China and Chinese continued after Ho 's release .",0

"He found that although the coincidence of business and political cycles was "" very marked "" with respect to the United States , New Zealand and Germany , this was not the case with respect to Britain because pressing action on the balance of payments swamped the cycle of economic policy - making revolving around elections . Alt 's book on The Politics of Economic Decline has explored the nature of political business cycles in Britain alone and has dealt with the possibility that governments might run the economy to their own electoral advantage through manipulating the rate of inflation , disposable incomes , and unemployment in such a way as to rally short - run popular support at election time . He finds no real evidence of any government attempting to hold down the rate of inflation in the short run in order to promote its own popularity at election time . Before the elections of 1964 , 1966 , and 1970 , real personal disposable income was rising at more than double its normal rate of growth — so supporting the political business cycle thesis , but Alt suggests that these "" short pre - election spurts may not do the government of the day all that much good , and there is no evidence that they do ( at least if short - term enough ) the economy any particular harm "" . He suggests that there is little evidence that any British Government ever managed the unemployment rate simply with a view only to winning the next election .",0

The early industrialists were not ‘ insensitive to the appeal of the country : the beauty of Cromford and Millers Dale suffered little by the enterprise of Arkwright , and stretches of the Goyt and the Bollin owe something to Oldknow and the Gregs’ .

"Historians have been more dismissive of the evidence of Whig crowds at the Hanoverian Succession , on the grounds that these appear to have been deliberately manipulated from above . We know that in London , for example , the anti - Jacobite crowds were organised by loyal societies ( or "" mug - houses "" , as they were known ) run by Whig politicians and members of the urban elite . Yet given the strength of Dissent in the capital and the depth of religious tensions , there is no reason to doubt that the rank and file who followed the leaders of the mug riots were genuinely anti - Tory . The fact that several provincial towns reported pope - burnings in November 1714 and 1715 should make us question how extensive support for the Jacobite position was at this time . And it should be remembered that the Whigs did much better than the Tories in the open and more popular constituencies in the elections of early 1715 , largely because the Jacobite scare and the fear of popery worked to their advantage .",0

"Possibly this will mean changes in behaviour ( such as the role of the man in housework ) which violate the norms and values into which they were socialised . On the other hand , if they were sufficiently wealthy they might be able to afford a nanny or a private nursery school .

"The School continues to attract large numbers of postgraduate research students with the Institute of Aquaculture and the Department of Biological and Molecular Sciences being particularly successful in this respect . As important as our research students to the well being of research , is the large number of research assistants and post - doctoral research fellows in the School . The preparation of submissions for the UFC Research Assessment Exercise provided a timely opportunity to take stock of our research activities in more depth than usual . The data gathered for the exercise clearly reflect the now very considerable research strength and performance that we possess . Despite increased teaching loads over the past three years , the School , as a whole , has very substantially increased its research funding and its research output , over the 3–4 year period of assessment .",0

IOSCO 's seal of approval would automatically increase corporate interest in the IASC 's future work . Greater financial resources would enable the IASC to satisfy some of its critics . The US and the Anglo - Saxon countries , for example , complain that it spends too much time and makes too little progress on basic standards , which they see as of benefit to developing countries alone .",0

"The broad comedy he brings into the drama is , like the operatic emotions of the romantic plot , performed with masterly finesse . As not only Chubei and Umegawa but also Yohei and his wife find themselves under sentence of death from the Shoguns ' inexorable laws , both couples make a suicide pact . In Yohei 's case , this collapses into a craven botch — hilariously acted by Ryo Amamiya — in which he more or less accidentally dispatches his wife but ca n't bring himself to take the plunge and throw himself into the river as promised . While this interlude spoofs the love - suicide convention , though , Chubei 's story spectacularly dramatises it . In a thrilling climactic scene during a howling blizzard in the mountains , he and Umegawa do kill themselves .",0

On the other hand , the arrival of an adult ' observer ' or ' intruder'may shatter the illusion and bring the play to a halt .

"On all these points , Mr Radice and the pharmaceutical industry are in agreement . The Department of Health has cultivated the myth for some years that section 118 of the Medicines Act is the only reason why it is prevented from explaining the decisions of the licensing authority in general or the recommendations of the Committee on Safety of Medicines , based on doctors ' reports of adverse reactions , in particular . The reports , made by doctors on yellow cards , is data that the committee owns and as such can be disclosed by them as they see fit . Papers based on such data have appeared in the medical literature on many occasions since the inception of the yellow card scheme in 1964 . On a select number of occasions the licensing authority has decided not to disclose to the medical profession and patients the data behind reasons for its decisions — for example , those relating to Opren ( benoxoprofen ) and Halcion ( triazolam ) .",1

"POTENCY The question remains , however , as to when a potency level is actually reached and how many succussions are needed to reach it and also whether different dilution factors need different amounts . For example if one succussion will turn a 29c into a 30c then extra succussions will simply intensify on the 30c level . If more shakes are needed then a gradual increase in potency occurs until a saturation point arrives and presumably only intensification takes place .

"In fact , in many factories all over Britain white workers are not only on the side of trade union bureaucracy but often on the side of the management against their black workmates . But there has been an important exception . In the most important strike of 1976 and 1977 the rank and file of the labour movement have demonstrated their support of black workers . The strike at Grunwick Photoprocessing is exceptional in many ways . Not only are the men and women involved people of remarkable courage and strength , but unlike Imperial Typewriters or Spiralynx it is a strike of black workers in an area well known for its tradition of left wing trade union organisation .",0

"The Watch Committee 's dismissal of one Liverpool constable in 1843 illustrates the orthodox explanation of the rapid turnover of police officers in the early years , when a force such as the Metropolitan could lose one - third of its work - force annually . Those Victorian forces had apparently enrolled too many inadequate individuals , susceptible to the kaleidoscopic temptations of street life . Personal pathology , individual incompetence , were easy excuses for the inability of many officers to stay the course . Constable failure not organisational failure was the cause .

"Citing the cases of Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand , the report noted that the adoption of labour - intensive development and the provision of social services for the poor had actually reduced poverty in these countries . In parts of Latin America , however , high public - sector borrowing resulting in inflation had significantly increased poverty between 1981 and 1987 . While stressing that economic growth and helping the poor were not contradictory objectives , the report recognized that its strategy could entail "" a trade - off , especially in the short run , between the interests of the poor and the non - poor "" . The report noted that the industrialized countries could improve the lot of 1,100 million people living on an average per capita income equivalent to less than US$ 370 a year by increasing and targeting aid to countries committed to reducing poverty . A 10 per cent cut in defence spending could pay for a doubling of development assistance ( which stood at $ 51,000 million in 1988 ) , while increasing aid to the target level of 0.7 per cent of gross nation product ( GNP ) would raise assistance flows to $ 144,000 million by 2000 .",0

Representatives of Conservative Central Office helped Heseltine 's local constituency association to draft a public reply to his open letter declaring its support for the leadership .

"Drama I was very determined that drama activities would play a central role in the English curriculum , and I found my Working Group were unanimous in supporting this approach . In the primary school , drama is most successful when it emerges as a natural development from children 's play . Successful learning often takes place when young children enjoy themselves in role - playing , which can make an important contribution to their oral and aural experience . Drama activity should continue to play a vital role in all pupils ' secondary school experience .",1
"Businesses are not making much in the way of profits , yet their business rate bills continue to go up and up,’ he added . ‘ When this relief was introduced we fought long and hard to get the term ‘ poverty’ replaced by ‘ hardship’to make it easier for small businesses to qualify . Now we find all that was to no avail , since nine times out of ten local authorities have pushed all thought aside of giving the relief.’ It appears few small businesses may be aware of discretionary relief . Darlington Council , for example , has not received any hardship applications from small businesses since the introduction of the UBR .",0

"George sighted along his stick as if taking aim . Then the man moved away , buttoning his shorts , and began to walk slowly , pacing his steps evenly and steadily . He made patterns in the space , first up and down , then diagonally across , always within the open area between the stream and the thicket . To Libby it seemed as though he was marking out boundaries the way she and George had done the winter it snowed ; making footsteps in the dense white stuff , indicating territories .

"If you have a particular task in mind it may be that a 2.4 volt drill will perform quite adequately , although as a general rule the lower voltage drills are best suited to small diameter pilot drilling and countersinking . Heavy duty drills can drill bigger holes and more of them ! It really is a case of horses for courses , and is further complicated by the duration of some woodworking operations , such as power sanding . Sanders are operated for much larger periods than drills . Drills are generally subjected to harder work , with variables such as the nature and density of the material ; from soft deal to hard oak , even metal and concrete .",0

"The profits were stupendous . Without needing to do more than put down sporadic resistance from the more independent clans , the 30,000 Syrian troops guarding the Bekaa for the heroin cartel were allowed to augment their pay by up to $ 1 billion a year in protection money . And this was chicken - feed next to the revenues earned by government - connected Syrians and Syrian - backed terrorist groups actually engaged in the traffic . Illegal narcotics contributed at least $ 5 billion a year to the Syrian economy , almost all of it in American dollars and other hard currencies . Without access to the American market for heroin and hashish , Syria and its Lebanese protectorate were as good as bankrupt .",0

"Worldwide , the systems integration business saw turnover rise 15.2 % to £ 318.2 m , comprising 76 % of overall revenues . Income from facilities management grew 8.8 % to £ 59.7 m , making up 14.5 % of the total . Although this activity has traditionally been based in the UK , Spain and Germany are now taking the plunge as , Bonelli said , an increasing number of companies and government departments are outsourcing as part of rationalisation or downsizing projects . In the UK , facilities management contributed significantly to profits , contracts including a 10-year deal with the Heritage Department worth £ 10 m . The software products arm improved sales by 2.3 % to £ 38.8 m , or the remaining 9.5 % of turnover , but research and development spend in this area has been reduced from £ 14 m in 1991 to £ 13.2 m in 1992 as a result of the agreement with IBM .",0

"Indeed , in the current situation , many enterprises would have a good claim for reimbursement on account of the receipt of ‘ sub - competitive’ incomes . As many economists have pointed out , the first priority is to reduce government intervention and permit real competition . After that , if differences in income per worker in different enterprises still seemed to be excessive , it would be reasonable to introduce a progressive tax on enterprise income within each republic or province , based on the level of the enterprise 's net income per worker . Redistribution between income groups All republics and provinces have progressive income taxes on total personal income , but their present coverage is quite small .",1

This will be the first county fixture ever staged at Gwersyllt and local followers can expect an explosion of runs if Brymbo 's prodigious run - makers Mark Jones and Nigel Roberts cut loose . Jones , a current Wales choice , hammered a century at the weekend while Roberts unleashed 68 off 25 deliveries as well as picking up three cheap wickets .

The use of regional geochemical maps for environmental studies in developing countries was investigated using data from ODA sponsored mineral exploration surveys in Bolivia , Kenya , Solomon Islands , North Sumatra and Zimbabwe . Regional geochemical maps provide information on background levels of metals against which environmental degradation can be monitored . The application of regional geochemical maps for land use planning was demonstrated as they indicate areas characterised by major and trace element excesses and deficiencies that may be of importance to the health of crops , animals and directly to humans .

"The political consequences of marriage were frequently cancelled out by other counter - alliances . On several occasions in the centuries of this book , a single family group ruled over most of Europe . Their relationships and marriage alliances did not conduce to peace , but they commonly gave the warfare of the period the appearance of civil war , even though the rank and file of the soldiers can hardly have felt the bond which united the leaders on both sides . Though warfare came increasingly to be in competition with marriage marketing as the chief business of kings , it lost none of its importance in the eyes of contemporaries : the more indecisive it became , the more attached they were to it . It is remarkable indeed how little understanding we have of warfare in this period ; and we shall never know in detail how medieval kings acquired and held their power unless we can find out more precisely how they recruited their armies and led them .",0
"Since 1990 , the Court of Appeal itself has sought to provide more systematic guidance for sentencers by laying down so - called ' guide - line ' judgements . These go beyond the immediate issues raised by a particular case and spell out the range of penalties felt to be appropriate for varying degrees of seriousness within a given offence category . In the early 1990s the Court of Appeal also sought to formulate more general guidance on overall sentencing levels by attempting to ' talk down ' the level of custodial sentencing for ordinary ' run - of - the - mill'offences . At first , the Lord Chief Justice 's pronouncements appeared to have had the desired effect , as the average length of prison sentences imposed on males aged 17 and above for indictable offences fell in both the magistrates ' court and the Crown Court in the months following the cases of R. v.

"The majority of these state criminals or politically ' untrustworthies'(neblagonadezhnye ) , sprung from Russia 's educated classes and her critically - thinking elite , that is , the intelligentsia . They thus represented a specific stage in the history of the revolutionary movement as a whole — that of the largely non - gentry , déclassé radicals , or raznochintsy , of which Chernyshevskii was the archetypal figure . Around the turn of the century , however , the social composition of Siberia 's community of political exiles became more diversified , more ' plebeian ' , as thousands of striking workers , members of Marxist - inspired proletarian organizations , rebellious peasants , participants in national liberation movements in the non - Russian borderlands , anarchists , rank - and - file Mensheviks , Bolsheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries became involved in the empire - wide tidal wave of social and political protest during the dying years of the imperial regime . While the government was to some extent successful in thereby isolating its opponents from their comrades in European Russia and elsewhere , the ' democratrization ' of the political exile operation only served to disseminate the seeds and agents of revolutionary change in greater numbers and into the remotest corners of the empire . Through the government 's own policies , therefore , Siberia was well supplied with an experienced and committed cohort of exiled revolutionary activists when revolution itself , followed by civil war , swept across the country during and after 1917 .",0

"Football Association chief executive Graham Kelly , giving evidence for the defence , told Salisbury Crown Court he could see 200 similar clashes in a week by watching just four matches . Brentford striker Gary Blissett , 28 , who denies causing grievous bodily harm to Torquay United defender John Uzzell , said the incident was just an accident . The jury was shown a video of the clash during a Third Division game on December 14 last year , which left Mr Uzzell with a broken cheekbone and a fractured eye socket floor . The prosecution alleges that Blissett ‘ cynically and deliberately’ thrust his elbow into his opponent 's face during a mid - air duel for the ball . But Blisset , of Rickmansworth , Herts , told the jury : ‘ No that 's completely wrong .",1

"The problem of going round in circles is caused by a surplus of information and explanation , and a deficit of ideas and reactions to those ideas . The peril of getting caught in an information loop is made plain if we look at the following facts . Whenever you ask a question of clarification or ask for information nine times out of ten clarification or information is forthcoming . Whenever you give clarification or provide information four times out of ten someone else will follow you by doing the same and three times out of ten someone else will follow you by asking for more . This means that seven times out of ten the provision of clarification or information results in more of the same or requests for more .",0

"Wordsworth , he reported , There is other evidence of a thawing - out during the 1830s . Of course he opposed the Reform Bill itself , yet said in a letter to Crabb Robinson ( 5 February 1833 ) : ‘ You mistake in supposing me an Anti - Reformer —that I never was , but an Anti - Bill man , heart and soul.’ In 1836 , the Bill now having been passed , he suggested to Gladstone that there ought to be more enfranchisement to cure the effects of it ; if the pyramid were extended at the base and the lower classes given some power , this would counter the preponderance of the manufacturers . In fact , Wordsworth 's position begins to look surprisingly consistent , if one considers what he is against ; he is prepared to use any weapon to attack liberal commercial values and the new affluent middle class .",0

"But why is mine slightly different to Howard 's ? You 're wearing the summer shorty for greater freedom of movement for your arms and legs but Howard 's got the full suit , for more protection in colder weather but they both work on the same principle . When the suit is wet , it traps a thin layer of water between the body and the suit and your body quickly warms that up to a comfortable working temperature but if you fall in when the suit is dry , the cold water can be quite a shock and so a good trick in cold weather is to put the wet suit on in a hot shower and then over the top you wear a spray suit again to keep off the wind and to protect the wetsuit .

"We 're back off north again to Canada on , with pianist Arthur Ozolins , accompanied by the Toronto SO under Mario Bernardi , offering Rachmaninov 's First Concerto , Dohnáyi 's substantial yet witty Variations on a Nursery Song , and the famous Scherzo from Litolff 's Concerto Symphonique No . 4 ( ) .

I remember one day prior to the publication of an Honours List in 1974 when Harold Wilson and George Wigg had dinner with me . Harold Wilson obviously had something on his mind and he told us that if we watched the television news we would hear something that he was sure would be of interest to us . It turned out to be the announcement of the elevation of Marcia Williams to the House of Lords . George Wigg almost had a stroke , in view of his undoubted and continuing hostility to her .",0
"Furthermore , the direct mechanism may take time to operate . In the meantime V will fall . Monetarists also recognize that the demand for money can shift unpredictably in the short run with changing expectations of prices , interest rates and exchange rates . Thus V is unpredictable in the short run , and hence the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand is also unpredictable in the short run . For these reasons monetarists argue that monetary policy can not be used for short - run demand management .",0

"The discussions before the crisis illustrated how little had been done to repair economic fundamentals . The European ~ Central ~ Bank 's vehement opposition to what is essential to all capitalist economies – the restructuring of failed or insolvent entities ' debt – is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system .

But , if that is a real fear for the ECB – if it is not merely acting on behalf of private lenders – surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital .

"Despite the recent successes of house churches and charismatic movements , the overall picture is unchanged . In the United States , however , it is precisely because churches are so full , and wealthy , that it is not easy to see that in fact secularisation in the form of ' laicisation ' has gripped the church by the throat . The philosophical Enlightenment , as we have seen , promoted rationality on a philosophical level . The immediate effects of that philosophical rationalism were felt only by the intelligentsia . But with the coming of modernity proper , that is with industrialisation , what made the philosophies so potent was that they became embodied as a functional rationality .",1

"We 've all grown accustomed to using credit . There can be a danger point , however , when the use of credit gets out of control , and unfortunately , with all the variety of credit available , it is sometimes too easy to avoid recognising the danger until it is acute .

"The bicycle was obviously shaking the old order to the roots , and with its customary irreverence the socialist Clarion ( 30 July 1898 ) — which had a large stake in the matter , because of the enormously popular Clarion Cycling Clubs — wondered ' how it is no one has written a cycling melodrama , with a hero and a heroine and a villain on wheels ' . No doubt the rapid growth of the Clarion Clubs , spreading the socialist cause by bike , was another of the spectres haunting Old England in its alarmist response to the pedal cycle : The bicycle was a powerful symbol of social change in this era , summing up so easily the fears brewing around popular freedoms and popular amusements , and it seemed to touch a brittle nerve of the process of democratisation . The Times ( 15 August 1898 ) had given the broadest indication of the shock - waves produced by the push - bike when it delivered its editorial judgement on ' The Bicycle as a Social Force ' , which bristled with otherwise unaccountable fears and allusions to deeper moving forces within society . The bicycle was accused of enlarging the scope for theft , and we were encouraged to linger over some of the more squalid details of profiteering and corruption which had accompanied the boom in the cycling industry .",0

"Teenagers ( and children ) should always be told about future events involving them moving house , or father going into hospital for an operation so that they have time to adjust to the idea . If you give them time and sufficient explanation and preparation , children can deal surprisingly well with crises in their lives . They suffer far more psychological shock if an event hits them out of the blue .

The congress — taking place in an atmosphere of extreme vindictiveness among the SED rank and file following the corruption revelations — will determine the future of the Communist Party . Representatives are due to elect a completely new central committee and politburo , but the party newspaper , Neues Deutschland , suggested yesterday that such ‘ Stalinist institutions’ would perhaps no longer be required if the SED was transformed into a ‘ truly democratic party’ .

"It was my intention to spend my time there simply painting the landscape and I wanted to work with strong colour on a large scale . I had already made a number of smaller works with Lascaux Aquacryl on watercolour pads and clocks , so I was aware of the colour range and paint handling . I took stock of full imperial size Bockingford tinted watercolour paper ( 300gsm ) because I wanted a robust paper with a slight background colour . The Bockingford papers are invaluable for working on outdoors , as the tint of the paper is very soft , giving a beautiful ground colour to work against . I stretched the paper onto a full size Peter Welton Frame , which makes life easier as regards stretching paper , but also gives you a firm support to work against .",0

"A little to the right , on the other side of the lane , the eye dwells upon a small park , with a boating - lake catching the light , and some modest landscaping ; and through the bare winter trees one sees the chimneys of a seemly Victorian ‘ big house’ . The house and park were made as late as the 1870s . It must be one of the last parks to be made in England , for landowners began to feel the pinch of falling rents soon after that . The house , in fact , is older , for the work of the 1870s , though apparently a complete rebuilding , is merely a stone casing around a house originally built by a successful merchant of the Staple , whose inscription is still over the door : ‘ Thinke and Thanke Anno 1570 ’ .

"The resulting demonstration projects established a base of knowledge to support more effective planning and implementation of stepwise regional remediation in terms of site characterization , cleanup technology , and temporary waste management . Adequate planning is particularly important because remediation on so large a scale – and in a densely populated area with such complex topography and land use – has never been attempted before . With a view to building local understanding and providing information to the international community , the output of this work is being summarized in a user - friendly , Web based communication platform that is now being developed . Decontamination work leads to a huge amount of waste , which needs to be managed – collected , transported , sorted , stored , reduced in volume , prepared for disposal , and , eventually , placed in permanent disposal facilities – at the local , regional , and national levels . Due to pressure to allow the rapid return of displaced residents , however , the JAEA demonstration projects proceeded only as far as establishing temporary storage facilities , intended as stopgaps until centralized waste conditioning , interim storage , and disposal facilities are available .",0

Normally , for an exchange to be arbitrary or capricious , it would have to behave in a way which no reasonable person in its position would have done .

"The stimulus plan contained $ 207 million for NSF in the current year , nearly half of the increase of 15 per cent being sought for fiscal year 1994 , which begins on 1 October ; without that running start , Congress is extremely unlikely to give NSF such a large increase in the face of pressure to reduce the federal deficit and to fund other domestic programmes . At the same time , two other research programmes that stood to benefit handsomely from the stimulus plan — the $ 103 million proposed for the Advanced Technology Program ( ATP ) within the Department of Commerce and $ 47 million sought for cooperative research agreements between industry and the national laboratories in the Department of Energy — are expected to remain important priorities for the Clinton administration and to enjoy rising budgets in 1994 despite the temporary setback in Congress . In the short run , ATP officials say they will cancel plans for another round of applications this summer to their programme , which funds proposals from individual companies and industry consortia , while the Energy Department expects to continue its emphasis on funding research projects within the laboratories that also serve the needs of industry .

"And , third , Greece , now the sickest man of Europe , must be treated in a way that does not spread the infection to the other countries on the eurozone 's periphery . All of this requires financing – bank recapitalization alone could require hundreds of billions of euros ( though these needs would be mitigated somewhat if the sovereign debt of large eurozone countries looked healthier ) . In the short run , it is unlikely that Germany ( and Northern ~ Europe more generally ) will put up more money for the others . Germans are upset at being asked to support countries that do not seem to want to adjust – unlike Germany , which is competitive because it endured years of pain : low wage increases to absorb the former East ~ Germany 's workers and deep labor - market and pension reforms . The unwillingness of the Greek rich to pay taxes , or of Italian parliamentarians to cut their own perks , confirms Germans ' fears .",0

"The result was an emphatic seven - try victory over a courageous side who , over the past few months in their own colours and in their other incarnation as the Canadian national team , have overwhelmed Japan and the United States and been pipped by Wales and Ireland ( minus their Lions ) after surrendering leads late on . That this win was achieved by an All Black team featuring only six first - choice Test players — Gallagher , Kirwan , Stanley , Deans , McDowell and Gary Whetton — is conclusive evidence of the great strength - in - depth of this touring party . The New Zealanders continue to strive for new Everests in rugby achievement and their coach , Alex Wyllie , has already thrown down the gauntlet by stating : ‘ If we lose a single game we will consider the tour a failure.’ On the evidence available from their thorough training sessions and the way they brushed aside the challenge from a truly competitive outfit here , it is hard to see these All Blacks returning home as ‘ failures’ . The All Blacks are searching for perfection on the pitch and the physical strength and skill of their forwards leaves you with the sense that they are not far from attaining that dream .",0

"Prices Throughout 1989 the OPEC reference or target price for crude petroleum remained at USdollars 18 per barrel as first set in December 1986 ( see p. 35101 ) . In February 1989 six non - OPEC ( NOPEC ) countries agreed to limit exports with a view to helping stabilize oil markets ( see p. 36478 ) , while in early March the Soviet Union also indicated that it would reduce exports by 5 per cent in the first half of 1989 . Moreover , in March - April two other factors contributed to a sharp upturn in world petroleum prices : the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill in US Alaskan waters and the temporary closure of a production platform in the North Sea ( see pp . 36541 ; 36606 ) . As a result in part of these factors , and also of firm demand , spot petroleum prices on the world market as characterized by the marker ( North Sea ) Brent crude , which had risen from a low of about dollars 12 in September 1988 ( see p. 36573 ) to dollars 16-dollars 17 around the turn of 1988 - 89 ( see p. 36411 ) and to over dollars 18 by mid - March 1989 ( see p. 36573 ) , increased further to over dollars 21 by mid - April .",0

"Although secular clerks , especially at parish level , were fully integrated with the community , the structure of their personal property differed from that of the laity . The richest ones , the bishops , were remote from local communities , and , as lords spiritual , were as much ‘ them’(as opposed to ‘ us’ ) to ordinary parish priests as to their congregations . At the opposite extreme of the scale , although the lists teem with wretchedly paid chaplains , assessments of less than 40s . were relatively few and far between , most lying in the middle ranges , between £ 3 and £ 20 . A pair of spectacles and 40s . worth of books set the late ( graduate ) vicar of Whitchurch somewhat apart from his parishioners , who probably did not appreciate his erudition , yet his private collection was certain to be innocent of both profound and frivolous titles , limited to practical works such as collections of sermons , primers of divinity and apologetics , plus , naturally , his Breviary , perhaps too a copy of the Vulgate , or Latin scriptures . If the greatest and richest in the land were exempted from the indignity of assessment , so many of the poorest were simply overlooked that every list ended up short of about one - third of the men it should have included , and since almost all of these were worth less than £ 2 the general level of wealth is made to look higher than it really was .",0

"In the early 1970s Charles Barker , who handled all their advertising , took a 25 % interest with the aim of developing a consulting division . Although Clive & Stokes took on one partner from Barker , Peter Bingham ( who had been personnel Director of Bowater ) , the strategy was not successful and in 1986 the connection with Barker was severed . Clive and Stokes then took stock of their position : Clive was now over 65 and looking to retire ; John Stokes was 61 and very much involved in public life as the MP for Halesowen and Stourbridge . They felt they should either bring in new blood or sell the company . Hamish Kidd — previously with Heidrick and Struggles — was introduced to them in 1978 , and it was agreed that he would work with them for a year with the aim of establishing that a sale could be arranged .",0
"LONDON – It seemed that a new model for global governance had been forged in the white heat of the financial crisis . But now that the ashes are cooling , different perspectives on bank regulation are emerging on either side of the Atlantic .

Better regulation and monetary policy during the boom years , therefore , could limit the scale of any bust .",0

"The problems involved in assessing ‘ functional importance’ render the concept highly dubious sociologically . Many critics have questioned the functionalists ' emphasis on the limited availability of talented people in societies . Are sufficiently talented people as few and far between as functionalists suggest ' ? There is much evidence to suggest ( as we have indicated in Chapter 8 on education ) that considerable potential talent is wasted , and that it is the stratification system itself which restricts the development of potentially talented members of society from the lower orders . The unequal distribution of resources in stratified societies enables the better - off to obtain privileged access to educational facilities to have their talent developed , while at the same time disadvantaging those at the bottom .",0

"Chairman , just before we leave things can I just remind members now that , that , the target set for this Committee was a net increase , and , have that in mind as we go through , and that increase is some six hundred and forty thousand pounds , which we could show within those papers as having arrived at it , in ninety four , five .

"The remaining three articles offer personal perspectives on childhood and the process of learning in the family .

The children 's play is described as modelling adult activities : hunting , agriculture , crafts , etc . There is no place for schooling in these children 's education , which is rooted in their day - to - day contact and intimacy with their environment .

"Recent progress was welcomed towards the establishment of the internal market , notably in the previously excluded sectors of water , energy , transport and telecommunications , in the financial services sector , and on company taxation . The summit called for rapid completion or progress as regards investment services and insurance , intellectual property , takeovers , the liberalization of road transport as called for in a Dutch memorandum , the harmonization of animal and plant health standards , and the adoption by the end of 1990 of new value added tax and excise duty arrangements and of guidelines on trans - European transport networks . Noting that the first stage of economic and monetary union ( EMU ) would come into effect on July 1 , 1990 , the summit decided that the intergovernmental conference to establish the final stages of economic and monetary union would open on Dec. 13 and would conclude its work rapidly with a view to member states ratifying the results by the end of 1992 . The intergovernmental conference on political union , based on the Franco - German initiative put to the extraordinary Dublin summit in April [ see p. 37363 ] , would open on Dec. 14 , with a similar mandate to conclude its work rapidly .

"In social research , perhaps the most famous example is that of Elton Mayo 's study of American girls in a factory , where his observations of the importance of the creation of social groups led to the development of a whole school of thought in social psychology . New facts found by accident may be the starting point for new theories and social observers are certainly not lacking in opportunities for chance stimulation in their ordinary everyday life , since they themselves live among the phenomena which they study . The difference of approach illustrated here between the apparently hard - working development from carefully formulated theory towards new ideas to be tested where there are gaps in the subject on the one hand and this last - mentioned almost accidental following - up of ideas that just seem to occur out of the blue , would , on the face of things , seem to make it difficult to use two such disparate methods of enquiry in one discipline . But it is by no means difficult if one has a procedure for social research and this procedure we shall now consider by working from an empirical approach to enquiry .

"This changed with the advent of floating exchange rates in the early 1970s , which allowed more stability - conscious countries , such as Germany , to decouple from a US monetary policy that they considered too inflationary .

Today , the US ~ Treasury can still borrow unlimited amounts at rock - bottom interest rates . Indeed , the interest rate on inflation - protected bonds has now become -0.5 % , even for a five year maturity !

"Not so the cultivators .

"There had been no change of basic thinking , then , merely an adjustment of emphasis .

We know little in any systematic fashion about the ideological motivation of the rank - and - file membership ( approximately 55,000 strong in November 1923 ) of the pre - Putsch Nazi Movement . Since anti - Semitism was such a prominent feature of the Party 's public image , and that of its leader , whom many must have heard speak in person in the Munich beerhalls , it seems certain that the ‘ Jewish Question’ ranked highly as a motivational factor at this date for the Movement 's recruits , often coming to the NSDAP from other anti - Semitic organizations and völkisch groups .

"Yet with a twist and a turn , he was away , skipping past four desperate challenges before slipping the ball into the net to level the score for Lazio at 1–1 . At that moment , he was well and truly back . Lazio manager Dino Zoff is convinced it 's Gazza 's destiny to rank at the pinnacle of football 's history , rubbing shoulders with the likes of Maradona . He said : ‘ Gazza has the skill and the opportunity to be as big as Maradona , but he 's not there yet . ‘ However he 's still young and has the potential to be as great.’",0
"Hal Lindsay states that ‘ the West has been invaded by the East’ and ‘ every Christian must be equipped to meet the onslaught of Eastern thought’ . Christian attorney Constance Cumbey goes a step further in The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow when she writes of the ‘ coming age of barbarism’ , and describes the New Agers as a ‘ viable movement that truly meets the scriptural requirements for the Antichrist and the political movement that will bring him on the world scene’ . Are the Americans going over the top again , or is this an indictment which we should place on trial ? At least one Englishman thinks so . He is Roy Livesey , a leading New Age watcher on this side of the Atlantic .",0

"I get the impression that Mr Ataie has decided what he wants to say and then created characters to fit his theme . Thus Sya , who announces that ' one who believes in war believes in God ' and who beats his sister with a khaki belt , is an inflexible symbol of a militaristic ethos . Equally , Penny remains on one level as a deluded fantasist who believes , very like an Iranian woman , that a wife 's duty is to wait for her husband 's return from the wars . The only character who shows any internal conflict or dramatic progress is Sohy who gets a glimpse of Westernised freedom ( symbolised by the abandonment of her veil ) but who can not easily shake off a lifetime of enslavement . Not only are the characters walking symbols but Mr Ataie uses poetic metaphor ( the text is filled with references to stallions and horses ) as a means of camouflaging daily reality .",1
"But he impatiently dismissed this line of thought . Little enough was left him now , but at least his dignity remained , though no one but himself could see it . If he were to start clutching at straws , hoping against hope for a way out , then even that would be lost . Back in his office he reached for the phone and dialled his home number . As usual , Maria Grazia answered and then yelled to his mother to pick up the extension phone by her chair , in the deep underwater gloom of the living room .",0
"Well , this was the greatest challenge of her life and she would damn well face it if it killed her . She would get through the next few days of being in the same house as Piers and then she would leave , and she would somehow get through the rest of her life without him . She picked up a piece of paper and began drawing little cameo pictures of the bowl of fruit on the sideboard , of the flowers in the garden , bending under the wind . Maybe she would take up her art again , and when she had polished that rusty talent perhaps volunteer to teach handicapped children . Her heart was n't in what she was doing , though .",1
"I have whittled my own shortlist down to four models : the Thorens TD166VI /UK with Rega arm ( £ 269 ) , Systemdeck IIX ( £ 248 ) , the Rational Audio Aura 01 ( around £ 195 including a Linn K5 cartridge ) and the Rega Planar 3 ( £ 250 ) . The Sound Organisation ( 4 Pickfords Wharf , Clink St , London SE1 , 071 403 2255 ) often have overhauled examples of the latter in stock , a perfect way to make what may well be your last vinyl upgrade at a reasonable price . Most machines come minus a cartridge , but you do n't have to spend a fortune — Audio - Technica produce a perfectly acceptable one for £ 19 , although that is rock bottom : there are genuine improvements to be had by budgeting for four times that amount . The odd one out in my list is in many ways the most beguiling . The Rational Audio Aura 01 is a Czech - made deck with a parallel tracking arm ( which moves across the record on rails instead of pivoting from one end ) , bizarre retro - styling and an idiosyncratic sound .",0

"The judge said it had sunk below a sensible level . And he said there were no grounds for overturning Sir Bryan 's ‘ sensible’ decision until the fund was increased .

"Even before kick - off Rangers got the afternoon off to an unexpected start . Last week Walter Smith sprang a major surprise by giving striker Duncan Ferguson his debut in the Old Firm encounter . This time the Rangers manager pulled another rabbit out of the hat by fielding England international full - back Gary Stevens after 15 months of injury . Even so , most eyes were on the Kilmarnock defence which had proved unexpectedly resilient in their opening three games . It was widely predicted that last season 's First Division runners - up would melt in the white hot cauldron of Ibrox .",0
"His head jerked round and he was just in time to see the pack stream out from the bushes only thirty yards away , noses still glued to the invisible trail they were following , and lope swiftly towards the house . When his head jerked back to look up at Grant again , it was n't his teeth that were gleaming in the dark now , it was the whites of his eyes , wide with fear . For a sickening moment he swung wildly on the rope and one of his feet slipped a few inches down the wall . Grant 's heart leapt into his mouth and he was convinced Larsen was going to lose his nerve , then his grip on the rope , to plummet down to an unthinkable death . But then the other man seemed to regain control of himself , for the next moment he was shinning up the rope as though he had just realised his life depended on it — quite literally !",1

"They have witnessed jobs destroyed services slashed opportunities wasted . In no area , colleagues , is the despair caused by Tory mismanagement more abundantly clear than in the area of welfare benefits . As our economy has declined as our recession has turned to a slump increasingly it is the low - paid , the sick , the disabled and the unemployed who have been forced to pick up the tab for the Tory policy failure . Congress , as we all know , the latest Tory plans have once again hit the least well off .

"As a result only a thin stratum of wealthy native merchants developed . Their prosperity was directly dependent upon political favour : the government itself constituted the most valuable market , established monopolies in the most lucrative goods , disposed of much of the available credit , and had the legal power to advance or halt new ventures . Moreover , as with the rank - and - file townsmen , the State 's bureaucratic weakness led it to impose crippling burdens on the leading merchants . The most eminent among them , headed by the so - called gosti , were saddled with the dubious honour of running the Tsar 's own commercial interests , or collecting customs and excise dues . The system distracted them from their own businesses and led many of the richest families to ruin , punished for failure to fulfil the Tsar 's expectations .",0

"Meth users often develop rotten teeth and horrible scabs caused by scratching themselves due to a sensation of insects crawling under their skin .

"Its intellectual and academic pedigree is impeccable . It is said to be effective , evidence based , and cheap to implement . Most of all , it stakes a claim to a degree of philosophical coherence of which the various “ third ways ” of the last decade could only dream . The novel idea , elucidated in Cass Sunstein ’s and Richard ~ Thaler ’s book Nudge , is that skillfully controlling the way alternatives are presented to us can “ nudge ” us toward making the choices that our own “ better selves ” would make . “ Libertarian paternalists ” like Sunstein and Thaler claim that we have two different ways of making decisions : one “ from the gut ” ( called System I ) , and the other more deliberative and far more effective ( called System II ) .",0

"In fact it was the television and newspaper pictures of police batoning demonstrators which proved to be the catalyst in transforming the situation .

"This reactive violence is thus justified by its subjects and the justification subsists in consciousness along with their Roman catholic profession of faith and identity . The provisional IRA 's commitment to violence against the British and against the protestant — loyalist alliance , which the provisionals rhetorically and conveniently subsume under the term ‘ the British’ , is frequently assumed to be based on either Marxist or nationalist principles and in both cases to be secularist or areligious . Yet some provisional leaders and rank and file members are committed to their Roman catholic religious belief and practice . These beliefs can in fact contribute to the motivation of their struggle . As Gramsci points out , the religion of the clergy is not necessarily the religion of this or that social group of laity , whose religious interpretation is also related to their own concrete world of experience .",0

Experience on statutory advisory committees to the health board has shown me how slow and often ineffectual they are .",0
"A detached head , who acts with detachment , coolly weighing matters up , allowing the mind to soak up ideas and to put them together in new ways , is not a primary - school image . He or she may choose to accept the load of small and troublesome issues and there may be no one else to take over certain tasks . To clear the decks needs a double effort : the machinery of school organization has to be kept rolling , the crises and questions which start outside the school have to be dealt with . At the same time documents have to be read , thinned down and explained to colleagues , usually with a footnote to mention that there is more documentation that the head will protect them from . Reading , thinning out and explaining the demands of NCC , SEAC , local authorities and governors takes more time than a head can find during a school day .",0

"Obviously , an obligation of confidence can arise by express agreement ; for example , where a freelance computer programmer is engaged to carry out some work under a contract which contains a term stating that the programmer will not use or divulge details of the client 's business . An obligation of confidence may also be implied by the courts where there is a duty of good faith as in the relationship between a client and a solicitor or patent agent or bank manager . Another situation where the obligation will be imposed is where a person discusses his ideas with business organizations with a view to the commercial exploitation of those ideas ; for example , if a computer analyst has an idea for a new computer system and discusses that idea with software houses interested in developing and marketing the system .

"Using ideas from then fashionable ‘ crowd psychology’ , Michels claimed that any mass of citizens is psychologically incapable of handling complex decisions . Masses need leaders who can stir them out of apathy and organize them , but once organized they defer to leaders and accord them steadily greater levels of discretion to pursue their own rather than mass interests . The socialist parties ' elite groups and the rank and file members had increasingly diverged in their social background , incomes , interests and capabilities . The large size and complex organization of mass parties create the need for leaders with expertise , stability in tenure of office , and specialized task - management . This organizational logic further increases the discretion which leaders enjoy to direct organizational activities towards their own purposes , even if this shift means betraying the rank and file 's interests .",0

The police national computer is one of the most comprehensive record systems in the world and it gives police officers across the country rapid access to vital information round the clock , every day of the year .

A request for the consideration of the establishment of an EWC could be made by any employee , or by central management . Such request would trigger a meeting of elected employee representatives who , unless they unanimously agreed otherwise , would request negotiations with central management with a view to concluding an agreement for an EWC . Such an agreement would embrace the nature , composition , competence and mode of operation of the EWC . In default of an agreement within a year , the minimum requirements of the domestic legislation of the Member State where central management was situated would apply , subject to additional minimum requirements laid down by the Directive .",0

Suppose the origin of intelligence is so improbable that it has happened on only one planet in the universe , even though life has started on many planets .

"The foreign policy issues on which the left fought were of great importance to the activists but of relatively little salience to the mass of the working class , while nationalisation had faded in popularity — quite understandably , given the failure to develop a popular democratic alternative to conventional managerial practice in the nationalised industries , and to develop a coherent set of criteria for allocating resources with which to counter the charge that they were ‘ inefficient loss - makers’ . The propaganda onslaught by the Tories and private business interests must have helped to discredit nationalisation , but this can not be the whole explanation . Even Bevan reckoned that if the Labour Party were to campaign on a programme fully reflecting the aspirations of the rank and file party activists ‘ we could say goodbye to any Labour government being elected again in Britain ' . Fortunately for the Labour Party , the position of the Tories as the party of government was less secure that it appeared to be in the late ' 50s .

"The phrase “ Great Recession ” creates the impression that the economy is following the contours of a typical recession , only more severe – something like a really bad cold . That is why , throughout this downturn , forecasters and analysts who have tried to make analogies to past post - war US recessions have gotten it so wrong . Moreover , too many policymakers have relied on the belief that , at the end of the day , this is just a deep recession that can be subdued by a generous helping of conventional policy tools , whether fiscal policy or massive bailouts . But the real problem is that the global economy is badly overleveraged , and there is no quick escape without a scheme to transfer wealth from creditors to debtors , either through defaults , financial repression , or inflation . A more accurate , if less reassuring , term for the ongoing crisis is the “ Second Great Contraction . ”",0

"The planning of British cities entered a new phase as a consequence . It gained an entrenched footing in local government through the extension of statutory town - planning procedures , which confirmed the bridgehead established before the war ; and , largely accidentally rather than by design , the activity of town planning came to involve other forms of public regulation , with the result that its field of concern was enlarged . Town planning was neither strong nor coherent enough as a discipline and profession for it to stake a claim and take over other intellectual territory ; as a movement it was too inwardly diverse to be sufficiently self - willed to embark on aggrandizement in its remit . Rather , town planning became involved in other environmental and social concerns almost by chance , though its claim for a comprehensive , synoptic view of things perhaps made expansionism inevitable . The analogy may be of Britain gaining an Empire by accident , and then losing it ; this century , town planning has expanded its subject field , as disciplinary boundaries first collided and then were realigned , at a time when the nature of complex environmental problems was reidentified and expressed again in different terms .",0

"Throughout human history , disabled people have constantly confounded the low expectations of others , and how much better it would be for special educators to raise the expectations of disabled children and their families by giving them an understanding of this , by helping them to accept their disabled identities with pride , by helping them to understand their place in the world and their rights as well as giving them the practical skills to deal with these issues . Of course , in order to do this , special educators would need to understand these issues themselves . Finally , it is sad but understandable that the parents of disabled children should clutch at the straw of conductive education as a means of resolving their own problems . To have a handicapped child in a society which has developed a fetishism for normality and which fails to even acknowledge the needs of these parents , let alone make any provision to meet them , is clearly a profoundly disturbing experience . But accepting the fetishism of normality can never even address these problems , let alone resolve them .",0

Midfielder Sanchez blasted the only goal of a scrappy match leaving Norwich boss Mike Walker pondering his best line - up for the UEFA Cup clash with Vitesse Arnhem on Wednesday . Walker dropped Mark Robins and brought in Efan Ekoku but Norwich looked woefully short of menace in attack . Ekoku failed to stake his claim for a place against the Dutch . The former Bournemouth player squandered three first - half chances and made little impact after the interval . Facing party spoilers Wimbledon before a European tie would hardly be the choice of any club and Norwich often appeared distracted as Wimbledon turned the screw .,0

"These ‘ loyalty discounts’ give rise to switching costs , since a consumer who switches to another supplier loses the discount . Such switching costs can serve to facilitate collusion and to deter competitive entry ( Klemperer , 1987 ) . Once again there is a trade - off between lower effective prices in the short run , against the loss of more active price competition in the long run . The issue of commodity bundling has been central to a number of celebrated competition policy cases , including those involving IBM in both the United States and Europe . The argument against commodity bundling is that by offering a bundle of goods at a lower price than the sum of the prices for the components of the bundle the supplier is able to prevent competition from producers of individual goods within the bundle .",0

"When they die , often due to punctures received during the rutting season , they deflate and plunge down to earth , exploding as they strike the Tarmac . The fact that you never see a flat hedgehog upon a soft grassy field , bears this out and proves my point somewhat conclusively , I so believe . Another case of popular explanation falling well wide of the mark is that of the so called‘extinct’ woolly mammoth . During my travels across the Siberian Steppes , some years ago , I chanced upon a team of Russian palaeontologists , who were clearly in a state of heightened exuberance . Apparently , an unseasonable deluge had washed away a section of river bank , exposing the perfectly preserved carcass of a woolly mammoth .",0

The model is a short - run model in which there is no economic growth and in which producers respond to changes in the demand for their products by changing the quantities they produce rather than their prices . Workers who face a reduction in demand for their services become unemployed rather than reduce their asking wages . This means that prices and wages may be assumed to be fixed in the short - run . 2 Household spending on consumption ( C ) and household saving ( S ) are both directly related to household after - tax income .,0

Although only eight of the 23 British Columbia players who went to the World Cup were on hand for the two games it was enough to see the host province safely through to championship no.23 by virtue of wins over Alberta — and that was a close call indeed — and NEWFOUNDLAND . The story of the weekend was most certainly the success of the team that travelled the full vast width of the country to emerge as only the second - ever to represent Newfoundland in the final . In the first semi - final they took Ontario completely unawares with a dashing try in the opening minutes by centre Greg McKinney which his partner Dennis Clarke converted for a 6–0 advantage .",0

"London , world city Any book on London that opens with Dickens must be on the right lines . Just a few paragraphs in and we are plunged into the fog and grime of the capital : in 1817 the American Ambassador was enveloped in a midday fog in Bond Street so thick that he felt tempted to ask how the English became so great with so little daylight . On a visit to the Royal Exchange in 1826 Prince Pückler Muskau reported that it ' and the whole City have a repulsive sinister aspect , which almost reminds one of the restless and comfortless throng of the spirits of the damned ' . This is the book of the exhibition at the Villa Hügel , Essen , which examined London from 1800–1840 , a great age of expansion in trade and science , arts and scholarship ( closes 7 November ) .",1

"And all the time she knew it in no way matched the reckoning , whose day could not much longer be postponed .

"As the economy expands , as income and wealth increase , it is likely that people and firms will wish to increase their indebtedness . On the assumption that nothing happens to change the relative attractiveness of different methods of borrowing , then we would expect the stock of bills to increase over time . However , in the short run , numerous factors may operate to cause changes in supply . Remember that bills are a method of short - term finance . If borrowers perceive medium- and long - term interest rates to be high and likely to fall in future then they will prefer to borrow short and refinance the loan later at lower rates of interest .",0

"The widespread practice of making local , individual and personal bonds had , as we have seen , been taken over into the world of factional politics in the 1540s . Now , it was invoked for a religious purpose . In Edinburgh , on 3 December 1557 , the earls of Argyll , Glencairn and Morton , Argyll 's son lord Lorne and John Erskine of Dun made a bond whose text dramatically threw down the gauntlet . These five people promised ‘ before the Majesty of God and his congregation to … maintain , set forward and establish the most blessed word of God and his Congregation … and forsake and renounce the congregation of Satan , with all the superstitions , abominations and idolatry thereof … ’ . This ‘ First Band of the Lords of the Congregation of Christ’ was followed up by four other such bonds between then and 1562 , charting not only the growth of the Protestant movement but also the increasing resistance to the regent and the French , which by late 1559 would reach heights undreamed of at the end of 1557 .",0

In part , this was due to the military superiority of the Nationalists in both matériel and organization , assisted as they were by massive support from Germany and Italy .

"This is the aggregate demand - aggregate supply framework which , at its most elementary , postulates two functional relationships , one for the aggregate demand for output as a whole ( AD ) and the other for the aggregate supply for output as a whole ( AS ) . The novel feature of this approach is the manner in which both AD and AS are posited as functions of the absolute price level , p , in such a way that , other things being equal , there will exist an absolute price level which will equate AD and AS at the full employment level of output , y * ; . A sudden fall in aggregate demand resulting from , for example , fiscal contraction , will , in the short run , produce a fall in output , but eventually the induced fall in the absolute price level will have a countervailing influence which will restore demand to its original equality with y * ; . Consider Figure 7.2 in which the logarithm of the absolute price level , p , is measured on the vertical axis and the logarithms of the supply of and demand for output are measured on the horizontal axis .",0

Also in contrast to the Nationalists , the internal differences which had so damaged the Republican camp prior to 1936 persisted even now , causing deep divisions between the Republican rank and file and their government , and between the political and trade union organizations of the Left .

Gloucester knocked up a new record at the weekend … at Kinghsolm they flattened Bridgend by forty two points to fifteen just three days after beating Newport … its the first time the cherry and whites have beaten two Welsh sides in the same week … in the valleys they 'd say … die yown … very good Voice over Six tries was just what the doctor ordered for a Gloucester team that 's been under the weather for too long this season … and this win was even more rewarding when you think that six first teamers were missing … Bridgend had a strong side out … not strong enough to hold the cherry and whites though … Simon Morris got the first try …,0
"The size of the claims , and the fact that the defendants can not recover their costs if they are found innocent , persuade many firms to settle out of court . A survey conducted at the beginning of this year suggested that 96 % of securities fraud cases are settled before coming to trial . Instances of firms fighting all the way to the courtroom — and on to appeal if necessary — are few and far between . The Big Six , in their statement , say that in 1991 they spent 9 % of auditing and accounting revenues — $ 477 m — on settling and defending lawsuits , and repeat an estimate that the profession as a whole is currently facing $ 30bn in damages claims . The threat , they say , affects business and the US economy as a whole in two major ways : ‘ through the actual and threatened failure of accounting firms , and through the survival tactics the firms are forced to employ’ .",0
"Emmie felt awed and a little lost and lonely , not because Alice was going away , but because nothing she could dream about her any more could be more splendid than the truth .

"‘ I have seen these things happen before.’ Business leaders , building society chiefs and the construction industry are also demanding an interest cut . They say that without the introduction of a full - scale growth incentive public confidence will remain at rock bottom with no increase in spending . Until that comes the housing market will stay stagnant , stopping a boost in confidence and jobs . A spokesman for the Halifax building society said : ‘ We need to break this cycle of depression.’",0
"This may be why the dollar slipped . More immediately , the war could , on some estimates , increase America 's monthly budget deficit by two - thirds while it lasts . Whatever the impact of the Gulf , America 's deteriorating economy suggests that the dollar could fall further in the short run .

The broad measure , M3 , grew by only 1 % in the 12 months to December , and actually fell for the last three months of 1990 .",0

"As to the functions themselves , they are deprived of their pragmatic identity and cast in a role in which they resemble the grammatical units that they replace . So we see ideas about the nature of communication interpreted in a reductive way , assimilated into preconceived ways of thinking to make them amenable to conventional pedagogic treatment . They are not examined with a view to appraisal which might require adjustments to concepts of syllabus design to accommodate them . In fact , a close consideration of work done in discourse processing would raise the possibility of even more radical accommodation . For example , there is evidence to suggest that a good deal of communication is achieved not so much by the online assembly of analysed items but by the adaptation of formulaic phrases ( see , for example , Pawley and Syder 1983 ) .",0
"Whoa , hold it . It 's very heavy this end , can we have a few more men.’ These were some of the instructions being given by the polemaster to the men on the ropes as the two ton pole began to shift .

A climber , Simon Walker , then ascended the pole to the garlands which hang fifty feet above road level .",1
"Peter found it therapeutic to go through the boxes . After his death , I learnt not to shut him out of my life and now I feel a comforting sense of continuity when I go through the boxes and find little notes by him which I have never seen before . I still add to subjects that are particularly in my line — playground games like marbles , tops and balls — as at the moment I am working on a book about children 's play . But I have to restrict myself , otherwise I will face the same problem I had with the books — the lack of somewhere to lodge all these wonderful toys . So I try to stick to things that are cheap and simple , like the French fluorescent skipping rope that I bought last week .",1

"Following government policy on market testing , and so as to ensure that the MOD operates within the agreed financial and manpower budgets , some catering facilities on RAF units have been transferred to contract catering operations . RAF Swinderby was ' contractorised ' as far back as the 1960s because the ending of National Service led to a shortage of cooks and stewards and now ther are probably about a score of units which work a mainly 9–5 day , or where the numbers are fairly small , that may be most suitable for ' contractorising ' . Those that need round - the - clock support generally stay with the MOD . All are kept under constant review to ensure that Service personnel ( and the taxpayer ) get the best value for money . Various recent legal enactments covering food safety and the environment have required the Catering Branch to set up continues review procedures .",0
"There she stood , in a dove - grey suede dress , looped and hung with a dozen necklaces of amethyst and rock crystal and pearl , her thick black - grey hair piled heavily , pinned with silver , attending a party in the very house where as patient she once in many hour - long sessions had disclosed to Liz on the ground floor the very secrets of her murderous mother 's heart . How could she have come here , who could have brought her , and would Roy feel compelled to divulge his and Liz 's own smaller , milder secrets in return ? Should she intervene , should she break them up , or should she ignore her uninvited guest , pretend , professionally , never to have set eyes on her before ? As she considered this , Hilda intercepted her gaze , saluted her , and majestically , graciously , demonstratively , voluptuously blew a kiss across the room : Liz waved back , less flamboyantly but with equal composure , for what did it matter , after all , that Hilda Stark was there , was it not a tribute to them both , to the efficacy of the cure ? Hilda brought no shadows with her , she smiled innocently in her dove grey ; the scandalous rumours had been , as Liz had predicted , forgotten .",0
"The following is a possible scenario where a slapping block might be applied . Your opponent throws a long - ranging reverse punch ; you draw back your front foot into a cat stance , withdrawing your body from danger . Your leading hand slaps down on the punch as you simultaneously punch over the top and into the opponent 's face . Being a combination , this is more likely to score than a single face punch which , as I said earlier , is often simply overlooked by the referee . Sometimes the alert referee will award a full point for your combination , though this is rare .",1
"At the moment , less than 10 per cent of S&N 's senior managers are women , but none of them are directors of any of the subsidiaries , let alone of the main board . Like the Royal Bank it is not setting specific targets . ' At the end of the day it comes down to individual decisions about individual jobs , ' says Fairweather . ' What we have to do is create a culture in which appointing women to senior jobs is easier , ' he says . That may not be as difficult as S&N or anyone else fears given that women 's more consensus - based approach to management is increasingly seen to be an appropriate style of management .",0

"There was no real communication , although surprisingly few people were aware of the fact Perhaps one of the worst moments in a group is described by H.K.B. , an excellent speechreader . When you are with a group of people and someone decides to be kind and ‘ bring you in’ , out of the blue you will be told ‘ We are talking about … ’ which could be anything ranging from the Prime Minister 's latest speech or last night 's TV programme to the odd behaviour of the woman next door . At this point you have got to say something interesting or else the conversation will pass on and leave you isolated once more .

"This high profile contract included the establishment of the Sheffield Education Business Partnership with a brief to encourage the setting up of a programme of coherent Education / Business links across the curriculum of schools and colleges . The approach used by Sheffield was particularly helpful , in that it established credibility for partnership at the highest level , with a supportive framework for development . Hinde House was one of ten comprehensive schools approached in the first year with a view to the launching of a school / industry partnership . As far as our school was concerned the timing of this initiative was a perfect match with our stage of development . If this had not been the case , we would have had serious reservations about participation .",0
"There 's a popular misconception that a beginner 's instrument does n't have to function in any way like a professional model , because much less is expected of it , and that is just not altogether true . So many guitar students are put off by the handicap of having bought a guitar which does n't do the business and so , from the point of view of playability alone , the Rockwood is a welcome addition to the marketplace . If quality control is up to scratch and this kind of general finish is maintained throughout the range , then I would not hesitate in recommending a Rockwood to anyone looking for a good , all - round , budget guitar .

"The demand need not be personally served on the debtor , but the creditor is under an obligation to do all that is reasonable for the purpose of bringing the demand to the debtor 's attention and , if practicable in the particular circumstances , to cause personal service of the demand to be effected . Where it is not possible to effect prompt personal service , service may be effected by other means such as post or insertion through a letter box ( Practice Direction , 18 December 1986,(1987 ) 1 All ER 604 ) . The demand may be advertised in one or more newspapers if the demand is for payment of a sum due under a judgment or order and the creditor knows or believes that the debtor has absconded or is keeping out of the way with a view to avoiding service and there is no real prospect of the debt being recovered by any enforcement action . If the demand is advertised , the time limited for compliance runs from when the advertisement first appeared . For the form of advertisement set out in the Practice Direction , 18 December 1986 ( ibid ) , see Appendix C , form 6 .",0
"But to say this is not to say that sighted people acquire colour concepts by ‘ experiencing’ colours . To say this would be like saying that people acquire the concept of the past by experiencing it in memory . All this about Descartes 's doctrine that mind and matter are two causally - related substances , about the manna → gripings model for talk about the objects of perception , and about the empiricist doctrine about how language is meaningful , has been with a view to understanding why Locke could not acknowledge the existence of the epistemic appearances of objects . There are two reasons , one arising from the manna → gripings model , the other from the empiricist doctrine about how language is meaningful . ( 1 ) If seeing something is like eating it with the eye , so that it gives us sensations in our eyes as eating manna gives us ‘ sensations of sickness , and sometimes of acute pains or gripings’ in our stomachs , then what physically enters the eye comes to have an importance not only for understanding the physical mechanism of visual perception , but also for understand the concept of visual perception .",0

"Armageddon Can Wait CAMBRIDGE – Where are global currencies headed in 2011 ? After three years of huge , crisis - driven exchange - rate swings , it is useful to take stock both of currency values and of the exchange - rate system as a whole . And my best guess is that we will see a mix of currency wars , currency collapses , and currency chaos in the year ahead – but that this wo n’t spell the end of the economic recovery , much less the end of the world . Let ’s start by acknowledging that the modern system of floating exchange rates has , on the whole , acquitted itself remarkably well .",0
"This eventually led to a re - leveraging of the public sector as fiscal stimulus and socialization of private losses – bail - out programs – caused a dangerous rise in budget deficits and the stock of public debt . While such fiscal stimulus and bailouts may have been necessary to prevent the Great Recession from turning into Great Depression II , piling public debt on top of private debt carries a high cost . Eventually those large deficits and debts need to be reduced through higher taxes and lower spending , and such austerity – necessary to avoid a fiscal crisis – tends to slow economic recovery in the short run . If fiscal imbalances are not addressed through spending cuts and revenue increases , only two options remain : inflation for countries that borrow in their own currency and can monetize their deficits ; or default for countries that borrow in a foreign currency or ca n’t print their own . Thus , the recent events in Greece , Portugal , Ireland , Italy , and Spain are but the second stage of the recent global financial crisis .",0
"It is believed , as already mentioned , that one of the greatest pleasures for a child comes from the security it feels when it knows that it is loved , and it is the ability to withhold manifestations of that love for a little while , or threaten so to do , that provides a non - violent means of securing acquiescence when it is required . To advocate the starting of the process on a very young child might appear to be heartless , but the overriding need to generate within the child mind the beginning of a conscience and the instinctive urge to activate it , must be the guiding factor . The accusation , ' that person has no conscience ' , carries a condemnation of character , but the real culprit is the society which has failed to raise to a position of the utmost importance in the public mind , the fact that the human conscience is the very rock - bottom foundation on which civilisation rests . The control which the withholding of love gives to a parent emphasises how tremendously important it is that a child should be genuinely loved in the first place . The very first effect of the absence of parental love is that the parent has no gentle sanction whereby the civilising process and the ensuing conscience can be started .",0
"Iain Munro , who resigned from management of the Dundee club earlier this year , a victim of progressive subversion , has a clear insight into all of this .

In 20 years in the game on both sides of the border , under top managers and representing Scotland at every international level as well as captaining the Scottish League XI , he knows the game backwards .

"But insufficiently strong policies have left dangers lurking beneath the surface . We have seen greater weakness than anticipated in the United ~ States and Japan . Even if this was due to temporary factors , including supply disruptions from the Japanese earthquake , labor and housing markets are still on the ropes in the US and some parts of Europe . Moreover , the countries on Europe ’s periphery remain in difficulty , as doubts about the sustainability of adjustment programs have resurfaced . This heightened uncertainty could spill over to economic activity in the rest of the European ~ Union through adverse feedback loops between sovereign risk and the banking system .",0
"This is an excellent aid to teaching . The radio is widely available — there are few households that do n't have one ; it is inexpensive , compared with other mechanical or electronic equipment , and it is an endless source of material on every possible topic . Radios today seldom need repairing or the attention of a technician ; they do not need accessories which can be expensive and can get lost or damaged . It is also relatively easy for anyone to record programmes , especially if one owns a music centre or a combined radio / cassette recorder . There are , however , regulations concerning the copyright and performing rights of programmes .",1

"The project examines in some detail the ways in which Western economies ( the member countries of the European Communities , the US and Japan ) have responded to this environment . Two exercises in particular are carried out : One develops an econometric model in which the differential structural change pattern in the major OECD economies is shown to be interdependent . It is demonstrated by means of both cross - section and time series studies on a disaggregated level that the evolution of relative supply - side characteristics ( productivity growth , renewal of the capital stock , product composition , etc ) of the different national industries affects their respective market shares in domestic and international markets and thus their growth performance . The other exercise involves a detailed examination of industrial statistics since 1973 in order to detect the various stages and compare the strength by which structural adjustment processes have taken place in the different economies . Their significance for the longer - term structure of industrial specialisation and the prospects for competitive success or failure in particular industrial areas of the different national economies is then evaluated .",1

Almost 25,000 balls has he sent down in Test cricket , and although Sir Richard Hadlee , in an otherwise gracious radio tribute immediately after the 400th wicket had been bagged , pointed to the greater number of Tests and deliveries needed by the Indian , it is by assessing the amount of support from the other end over the years that we gain a full picture of Kapil 's place in history : he has carried India 's bowling almost throughout his career .

"Generally speaking the ' political ' cure for inflation comprised some form of prices and incomes policy , and was regarded as the only alternative to the less palatable ' economic'cure of demand deflation . In the heady days immediately following the Keynesian revolution , many of Keynes 's followers began to express concern at the consequences which might flow from a commitment to full employment . Whereas the massive unemployment which had plagued the interwar period has at least served to keep the lid on money wages , the switch to Keynesian policies , with their emphasis on the objective of maintaining full employment , might open a Pandora 's box of inflationary money wage claims . The transformation of the industrial relations climate which would be brought about by adherence to Keynesian principles could produce a potentially catastrophic spiral of money wage increases leading to price increases leading to a build - up of inflationary expectations . Many Keynesians went further .",0

"This referendum would determine once and for all whether or not the French people supported his self - determination policy . The purpose of this initiative was to abandon integration . But its effect was to cast serious doubt on the policy of association and to hasten negotiations with the GPRA with a view to total independence . In the referendum of 8 January 1961 , seventy - five per cent of the metropolitan population backed de Gaulle 's policy , but an equally significant result was the clear majority of Muslim Algerians who followed the GPRA 's instructions to abstain . Even before he learned of this result , de Gaulle had decided , on the basis of first- hand observations during his final trip in December 1960 , that his original association strategy was dead .",0
