NEW YORK -- World stock markets posted sharp gains on Tuesday as signs of progress in curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus in both Europe and the United States fueled investors' appetite for risk.
 Oil prices climbed on hopes of a deal to decrease supply, while the euro jumped against the greenback after six sessions of declines.
 Japan's Nikkei posted a 2% gain overnight as its government promised a near $1 trillion stimulus package - equal to a fifth of its gross domestic product.
 Mainland China reported no coronavirus deaths for the first time since the pandemic began and a drop in new cases, a day before Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, was set to lift its lockdown.
 But France's coronavirus figures on Monday showed that the rate of increase in fatalities sped up again after several days of slowing, even as the increase in people needing intensive care continued to decelerate.
 "This is looking more like a bear market rally," said Nancy Perez, senior portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth in Miami.
 "I think there's still a lot of headwinds that could cause this market to re- test the lows. There will be the initial resumption of business on paper, but then the actual actions will have to follow."
 Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 1.3 million people and killed over 74,000, and though the numbers are still rising in many highly populated countries, some tentative improvements have given hope.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 506.01 points, or 2.23%, to 23,186, the S&P 500 gained 45.28 points, or 1.70%, to 2,708.96 and the Nasdaq Composite added 64.89 points, or 0.82%, to 7,978.13.
 The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.55% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 2.03%.
 Emerging market stocks rose 3.20%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 2.7% higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 2.01%.
 With market optimism on the rise, the U.S. dollar dropped and riskier currencies outperformed as risk appetite improved on hopes that lock-downs may be slowing the spread of the coronavirus in some countries.
 "Fatalities in the UK remain relatively low and slowed for the second day, although the apex is still thought to be about 10 days away," Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said in a report.
 "High-frequency data on coronavirus infections and death rates continue to stabilize," he said.
 The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, fell 0.675%, with the euro up 0.83% to $1.0881.
 The Japanese yen strengthened 0.17% versus the greenback at 109.06 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.232, up 0.74% on the day.
 OIL WOBBLY
 Oil prices were in and out of negative territory as hopes that the world's biggest producers would agree to cut output were countered by analyst fears that a global recession in the wake of the coronavirus crisis could be deeper than expected.
 U.S. crude was up 0.77% at $26.28 per barrel and Brent was at $32.95, down 0.3% on the day.
 U.S. Treasury yields rose as the bond market mulled a looming supply deluge and as stocks continued their rise.
 Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 26/32 in price to yield 0.7581%, from 0.678% late on Monday. The 30-year bond last fell 1-20/32 in price to yield 1.3444%, from 1.285%.

To ensure that its conservancy workers on the field remain fit during the COVID-19 spread, the Coimbatore Corporation began conducting health camps for them in the city on Tuesday.
 The civic body held the first camp at its S.R.P. Ammani Ammal School in R.S. Puram, after the workers completed the work for the day, Corporation sources said. Around 200 workers, both men and women, attended the camp.
 Two doctors and five paramedical staff screened the workers for COVID-19 symptoms and their general health.
 The Corporation staff told the workers about general well-being techniques, how they should protect themselves and their family from COVID-19, the importance of using masks, gloves and hand sanitisers.
 The sources said the civic body also used the opportunity to talk to men workers addicted to liquor. The idea was to help them overcome withdrawal symptoms and use the opportunity to kick the habit.
 The sources said the Corporation had planned several such camps in the coming days – till the end of the lockdown – to cover all conservancy workers. It planned to hold the camps close to the points where the workers assembled after work, to be taken back to their homes.

Termine, die nur in der Ambulanz möglich sind, weil zum Beispiel eine Blutentnahme erforderlich ist, finden weiterhin vor Ort statt. Dazu füllen alle Patienten vor Betreten der Ambulanz einen Fragebogen aus, um eventuelle Hinweise auf eine Corona-Infektion vorab abzuklären. Außerdem wurde der Terminplan bereits so angepasst, dass sich Patienten in den Räumen kaum begegnen und insofern eine eventuelle Ansteckung praktisch ausgeschlossen ist.
 ## Der direkte Kontakt mit Patienten lässt sich nicht immer vermeiden
 Auch im Zentrum für psychische Gesundheit und Psychotherapie können mittlerweile Erstgespräche per Video geführt werden. In einigen Fällen (zum Beispiel bei besonderer Belastung, schlimmstenfalls Suizidalität) ist der direkte Kontakt jedoch unerlässlich. Daher wurden in der Zwischenzeit weitere Schritte unternommen, um die Ansteckungsgefahr zu reduzieren. „Durch diese Maßnahmen und eine ausführliche Information zu unseren aktualisierten Online- Therapieangeboten ist es uns gelungen, für die meisten Patienten trotz der Corona-Krise ein Behandlungsangebot zu machen“, so Prof. Willutzki.
 Schwierigkeiten in der Weiterbehandlung gebe es vor allem bei sehr vulnerablen Gruppen wie älteren Patienten. Viele verfügen nicht über die technischen Möglichkeiten für oder haben Bedenken gegen Videotherapien. Zum anderen können sie als Risikopatienten nicht durch den öffentlichen Raum zum Zentrum kommen und sind zum Teil auch auf öffentliche Verkehrsmittel angewiesen.

Essential commodities have been distributed to people living in the 19,753 houses located in the containment zones in Udhagamandalam, Coonoor and Kotagiri towns.
 The residents were also given ₹ 1,000 in cash as part of the financial assistance announced by the Chief Minister to all ration cardholders, said the Nilgiris Collector, J.Innocent Divya.
 Ms. Divya said the containment zones had been set up around the residences of four persons who tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 380 teams had been established to go from door to door in the containment zones to check if any of the residents were showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Special emphasis was being given to households with elderly people and pregnant women. The Collector added that so far, none of the people living in these zones had shown any symptoms.
 The four persons, who were kept in the isolation ward at the government headquarters hospital here, had been moved to a treatment facility in Coimbatore on Sunday.
 Four others, who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi, had also been kept in the isolation ward at Udhagamandalam. Their test results were negative for COVID-19. The primary contacts of all eight persons had been quarantined, the Collector added.
 Following reports that farmers are disposing of their harvest due to problems with the movement of freight between districts, and also due to the shutdown of many businesses, the district administration has appealed to them to reach out to the Horticulture Department or the Agri-marketing Department that have offered to purchase their produce.
 The Horticulture Department stated that the farmers could use their cold storage facility in Udhagamandalam that had a capacity of 500 metric tonnes.
 Moreover, if the farmers continued to face troubles in selling their produce, the department itself would purchase the produce at fair prices, officials said.
 The Horticulture and Agri-marketing departments have been preparing vegetable bags to be sold at ₹ 150 per bag to people living in the containment zones and in remote parts of the district.

Austria's Alpine province of Tyrol lifted on Tuesday the quarantine order it placed on its towns and villages to combat the spread of the new coronavirus, though several particularly hard-hit ski resorts remain sealed off. The province, wedged between Italy and Germany, was the first to report cases of the new coronavirus in Austria and became its most infected region.
 On March 19 local authorities placed every town under quarantine, ordering people to stay in their community and banning outdoor exercise, even stricter measures than a national lockdown introduced days earlier. "We have lifted the quarantine on communities... The reason was that we have stable infection growth numbers. The rate of (daily) infection increases was less than 5% and this trend is holding," Tyrol's conservative Governor Guenther Platter told a news conference.
 Tyrol's decision to loosen its measures and align itself with the rest of the country came hours after Chancellor Sebastian Kurz on Monday outlined plans to start reopening non-essential shops after Easter. Tyrol reported Austria's first coronavirus cases - a couple infected in Italy \- on Feb. 25. It still leads the country in infections, with 2,835 of Austria's more than 12,500 cases.
 Local authorities in Tyrol have come under fire for their apparently slow response to outbreaks in ski resorts where the virus found a breeding ground in crowded apres-ski bars, infecting hundreds of tourists from across Europe. The resort town of Ischgl, where a quarantine remains in place, is at the origin of the country's biggest cluster of infections. Just over 600 cases in Austria can be traced back to that area.
 Austria's public health authority has concluded Ischgl's outbreak began in early February, even though the first positive test there was a month later. The first action taken was to order the closure of a bar with an infected staff member on March 9. Tyrol's government has dismissed the finding that Ischgl's outbreak began in early February as "not serious". Prosecutors have asked the police to investigate whether there was a failure to declare an infection after a German media report of a positive test in late February.
 Tyrol is planning extra tests in the coming days in Ischgl and its surroundings as well as at the resorts of St Anton am Arlberg and Soelden, which remain under quarantine. "Experts will carry out an analysis and clear things up, then in agreement with the Health Ministry we will decide what to do next from April 14, but we will announce this decision at the weekend," Platter said.

Don't feed the monkeys
   
 Capt. Tom O'Lennick of Capt. Tom's Custom Charters was a revered Silver River tour guide for 35 years. He died at age 69 in 2018. Since 2001, my late husband and I treated many of our friends and visitors to a three-hour river tour on his pontoon boat.
   
 He had an encyclopedic knowledge of local river history and a wonderful sense of humor. He also had a deep respect and regard for the environment. When it came to seeing the monkeys that call the shoreline home, he was emphatic in stressing the importance of not feeding them. He stressed that they are wild animals and unpredictable in behavior. It was always a thrill to see them, but he taught his passengers to respect their habitat.
   
 The beauty of the Silver River is magical, and Capt. Nick Bozman is correct when he says "it's beyond beautiful."
   
 I truly hope the monkey population can be regulated so as not to jeopardize the joy of seeing them. And, I hope the current tour guides will have the courage to educate their riders to refrain from feeding the monkeys for their safety as well as the well being of the animals.

 COVID-19 and toilet paper
   
 I'm not always up to date on all things, but for the life of me I can't understand why everyone is buying up all the toilet paper in town! First of all, everything I read about the virus says it's a respiratory virus that affects the lungs. So what does that have to do with toilet paper?
   
 Once I realized I won't be running to the bathroom every two minutes if I get the virus, I started to wonder what all these people are doing with it. I guess you could build your own COVID-free zone by stacking it like a fort and staying in it to protect yourself from others, but that doesn't seem reasonable. You could build a "Midas Man"-type outfit for wearing outside, but I've not seen anyone doing that. You could spend your isolation making toilet paper wedding gowns like they do at bridal showers; it would use up some time.
   
 I'm not really sure what they're doing with it, but for most people, we now have to show up at stores at opening to be able to find some on the shelves!
   
 If you already have a stash of toilet paper because you bought your limit and walked out and walked back in to buy more, stop it! Save me a few squares!

 Pay close attention
   
 "One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. " It seems that many of us have forgotten what made this country great and the notion that "there but for the grace of God go I."
   
 It is far too late to try to isolate the COVID-19 by imposing travel restrictions on the current hot spots. As the number of cases and death toll rise, it should be clear that no place in the country is immune. Remember we went from one to 15 cases in the nation, and from zero to 23 in Marion County in just a short period of time.
   
 We should all pay close attention to the medical experts and scientists and change our behavior appropriately. Some of the people "fleeing" New York may be coming to care for a loved one who retired to live in Florida and brought their pensions to boost our economy.
   
 I can't help but wonder how different our situation would be if people aboard the Diamond Princess and or Grand Princess had been brought ashore immediately and isolated and tested for the virus. They weren't numbers, they were people and deserved compassionate care.
   
 Could more have been done to prepare for the spread? I'm sure the answer is yes. But we must move forward as one nation and give the care to every person in this country that we want for ourselves.

Beachwood senior Christian Mayfield, who was the D-II and III indoor state champion in triple jump last month, is seeking to maximize his surroundings.
 “It’s definitely a lot," Mayfield said. "It’s been stressful. I have been wanting to go out and practice with my team and get back into the swing of things. I’m doing well. I’m still practicing, going outside and running, doing stairs in my apartment building, running around the complex. I’m just doing stuff to stay in shape.
 "For me, I do short sprints outside and I run two miles every couple days. And I go on the Nike app and I do a couple workouts from there. I do hills also around my area at Thornton Park, the hills there, and at Cain Park.”
 Parks, with social distancing observed, are also seeing their share of athletes in Euclid.
 “Basically, I’ve been telling some of my girls right now, depending on the space, my sprinters for instance are doing quickness drills," Euclid girls coach Larry Nosse said. "They’re working on just a lot of speed work right now. Depending on the distance, 50 meters, 100 meters, they’re working on their starts. Some of them are running on stairs. A couple of them asserted they have gone to a stadium and found stairs. Some of my distance girls are just putting in mileage right now.
 "In Euclid, we’ve got Sims Park. We’ve got McDonald Field, so there’s a few things in Euclid where a few of them are doing that. But I basically told a lot of them, get some speed work in and make sure they’re getting in some cardio. They can only push themselves so much because they’re not working out with another group. So I’m giving them workouts, some things they can do on their own where they have the space provided.”
 Bison senior Ashley Perryman, one of the area's most versatile stalwarts throughout a decorated career, is trying to keep her options open, too.
 “I mean, I’m just doing anything I can," Perryman said. "I’m taking runs around the neighborhood. I’m doing sprints up and down the street. One of the streets parallel to me is about 400 — I remember from the GPS, it’s like a quarter of a mile. So I was like, ‘Oh, this is a 400.’ So I run down the street, and some free body exercises. Definitely some core.
 "Anything we can to stay fit. I joke and say that I’ll play some ‘Just Dance’ to stay in shape.”
 The good thing about track and field, Geneva girls coach Bobby McQuoid noted, is much of the work can still be done — although it will require some creativity for the time being.
 “A lot of our kids are so conditioned to what we do and kind of a routine that, with the beauty of having running, throwing and jumping, you can do a lot of the workouts anywhere, at your house or running trails, pretty much distant from other people," McQuoid said. "But they kind of run the same routine as to intensity and volume per each day during the week. The kids are pretty smart. It’s something, they have done it themselves.
 "The biggest challenge is that accountability when you’re by yourselves and getting the motivation up, especially during this tough time, mentally I think more than physically, knowing what they’re going through and what they’re probably thinking.”

The treatment of severe cases is one of the issues concerning attendees from overseas hospitals. As the leader of the first national anti-COVID-19 medical team and a professor at the Infectious Disease Section of the Department of Internal Medicine at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Liu Zhengyin shared on a specific topic from his experience in treating severely ill patients in the intensive care unit. From the viewpoint of the expert attendees (including Liu Zhengyin), hospitals are the front line of the battle, but as medical workers are fighting the war, we should bear in mind protection of medical staff is, another equally important battle. Since COVID-19 is highly infectious, it is not easy to keep cases infected in hospitals at zero. Prof. Hu Bijie, who once fought the SARS epidemic in 2003, had a particularly deep understanding. Having worked in the anti-infectious field for more than 30 years and rescued numerous patients at the front line, Hu shared the experience of metropolis Shanghai in the fight against COVID-19 and repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining a sense of defence for medical workers. A veteran with similar experience, Prof. Jia Xiaomin combined his personal experience in treating patients at the Hubei General Hospital Medical and Wuhan Jihe Hospital in common ways to prevent and control COVID-19 infections at hospitals and protect healthcare workers. Speaking of the day when the hospital was removed from the list of designated COVID-19 hospitals, he slightly lamented: "Since the hospital was designated on January 23, we had been fighting for 51 straight days, treating and discharging 515 patients and achieving 0% in the fatality rate and the infection rate for healthcare workers".

Betty Ann Heard      It is with saddened hearts we share that our Mother, Betty Ann Heard, was called home to Heaven on Saturday, March 28, 2020. She went peacefully in her sleep as she hoped would happen. Our Mom lived for the past year in an apartment at Good Samaritan Society Scandia Village in Sister Bay, WI. Everyone there took such wonderful care of her for which our whole family is eternally grateful.      She and our Dad, Jim Heard, Sr, retired to Ellison Bay in Door County, WI 32 years ago from McHenry, IL. They felt this was their "Heaven on Earth". Mom did volunteering, was very active with Al-Anon and cared for our Dad who had Parkinson's disease the last 14 years of his life. He preceded her on the journey to heaven eleven years ago.      Betty Ann is survived by her children, Betty (Tom) Thompson, Jim (Janet) Heard, Jr, Joyce (Dave) Miller, all from McHenry, IL, John (Vicky) Heard from St. Louis, MO, and Diane (Jeff) Levison, from Pagosa Springs, CO. She will also be deeply missed by her ten grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren with number nine due in August.      A Celebration of Life will be held at a later date.      In honor of our Mother, donations to the Shepherd of the Bay Memorial Fund (PO Box 27, Ellison Bay, WI 54210), would be greatly appreciated.

Here’s something you can do with your iPhone 7 Plus right out of the box: Use its dual-camera setup to zoom in on objects. Apple makes accessing this feature as simple as possible.
 From within the camera app, find the 1x button on the iPhone’s screen. Tap that button to zoom in to a 2x view; tapping the button again takes you back to 1x. For more of a zoom, just tap and press the 1x button and a semicircle will appear; from there you can drag the button to get up to a 10x zoom. Just note that anything beyond 2x incorporates digital zoom, which can degrade image quality (though not as much as phones that have to rely completely on digital zoom, our testing has found.)
 And if you’re the sort of person who lives and dies with pinch-to-zoom gestures, you can still use those to zoom in and out on a shot, though without the precision you’d get from the other methods for controlling your camera’s zoom.

With early signs that the coronavirus outbreak is plateauing in New York and other hot spots, some U.S. health officials say the pandemic may kill fewer Americans than recent projections, while racial disparities in the death toll have started to emerge.
 U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Tuesday said he concurred with the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that some research models had projected death totals that may prove too high, though neither would offer an alternate estimate. Authorities have championed "social distancing" and other mitigation policies, saying they were having a positive effect in fighting the spread of the pathogen in the United States but warned against complacency.
 More than 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders issued by state governors. A day after the governors of New York, New Jersey and Louisiana cited data that offered a glimmer of hope, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was too early to declare that a corner had been turned in the fight against the coronavirus but he pointed to some encouraging developments.
 "I can say in the last couple of days, something is starting to change. We don't know if it will be sustained but it is meaningful now," de Blasio told a news conference on Tuesday. The White House coronavirus task force projected a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000 a week ago, saying containing deaths to that range was possible if strict social distances measures were respected, implying it could go even higher.
 Adams on Tuesday told ABC's "Good Morning America" that he was encouraged by recent data showing a possible "flattening" of the outbreak in some areas, referring to the shape of the curve when deaths are shown on a graph. Asked if he believed the death toll would come in below the dire White House task force projection, Adams said, "That's absolutely my expectation."
 "I feel a lot more optimistic, again, because I'm seeing mitigation work," he said, adding that he agreed with CDC director Robert Redfield that deaths could fall short of totals that some computer models showed. Early data from U.S. states shows African Americans are more likely to die from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, highlighting longstanding disparities in health and inequalities in access to medical care, experts said.
 "We know that blacks are more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease. And I have shared myself, personally, that I have high blood pressure," Adams, who is black, told the CBS program "This Morning." Data from Chicago officials on Monday showed that black residents make up 52 percent of coronavirus infections and 72 percent of deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.
 "Those numbers take your breath away. This is a call to action moment for all of us," Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said on Monday more than 70% of those who have died of the coronavirus in his state are African Americans.
 "Obviously this is a big disparity," Edwards said. 'IMPROVED A BIT'
 De Blasio cited some signs of progress in the most populous U.S. city. "The number of people showing up in our hospitals who need a ventilator - that situation has improved a bit in recent days." That was giving authorities more time to acquire more ventilators, de Blasio added.
 "For the first time in many days, we did not see a major increase in the number of ventilators needed" in hospitals that have been bearing the brunt of the outbreak like Elmhurst Hospital in Queens and Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx, de Blasio added. The coronavirus death toll has surpassed 11,000 in the United States and confirmed cases have topped 368,000.
 President Donald Trump, who previously said the coronavirus would miraculously disappear, responded to the recent White House projection by saying any death toll less than 100,000 would be considered a success. Redfield of the CDC on Monday told KVOI radio in Tucson, Arizona, that social distancing of the type ordered by nearly all state governors was effective.
 "If we just social distance, we will see this virus and this outbreak basically decline, decline, decline. And I think that's what you're seeing," Redfield said. "I think you're going to see the numbers are, in fact, going to be much less than what would have been predicted by the models." A research model from the University of Washington \- one of several cited by leading health authorities - forecasts 81,766 U.S. coronavirus fatalities by Aug. 4, down about 12,000 from a weekend projection.
 American hospitals have reported shortages of personnel, protective garments and other supplies while patients agonize alone, prohibited from receiving guests.

"So we’re feeding them as much information as possible. I put together a three-week schedule for the distance kids, things they could do at home on a treadmill or in their neighborhood. Obviously, we’re not telling them to meet, because we want that social distancing.”
 Both the Cardinals' boys and girls teams use the TeamBuildr app for their training during this halt.
 Mentor girls coach Bob Berwald lauded the flexibility Wilcox has instituted to account for equipment or lack thereof from athlete to athlete while at home.
 "What he’s done is he has the workouts set up so you can do it if you have weights, or you can do the body weight version of it," Berwald said. "So we’ve got two versions of every workout.
 “The nice thing about the app, from the strength training part of it, is it’ll show — you type in when you finish a workout, so he knows who has been working out and who hasn’t been doing the workouts, and we can touch base with those that haven’t been doing the workouts.”
 Among a litany of them during an unprecedented moment, one challenge stems from athletes participating in field events, an area in which Berwald's squad is especially adept with 2019 Division I state long jump outdoor champion Paige Floriea and 2020 D-I state high jump indoor champion Tori Lanese.
 Berwald said his daughter Breanna, a sophomore thrower for Mentor, has been working out with a rubber discus in the cul de sac where the family resides. On the TeamBuildr app, a squat workout, since Berwald doesn't have a squat rack, was adapted to 25 body-weight squats.
 "I have the best long jumper in the state, and I can’t do anything," Berwald said. "She can’t get into the pits. We can’t do anything. That’s hard for her. I know she’s doing what she needs to do at home. She’s very fortunate to be able to have things at home that she can do some stuff there. But it’s those other girls.
 "The pole vaulters — I mean, there’s nothing you can do. You can do some exercises. That’s hard. The high jumpers, we have an indoor state champion high jumper. Her dad told me she’s doing some of the drills on her bed. She’s trying to do different things.”
 Track and field athletes around the area are also getting creative.

Conspiracy theorist David Icke who claims the coronavirus “is A Carefully Choreographed PLANDEMIC” has also shared the screenshot.  
 The misinformation got an extra boost when it was written up by the Washington Times, a right-wing American news website, under the headline “Before lockdown, Britain quietly downgraded status of virus threat”.
 The article, which has been liked and shared over 20,000 times, has been seized upon by conspiracy theorists as supposed proof of governments admitting the disease has been overhyped.
 The Facebook groups where the Washington Times article was interacted with the most times included “Chemtrails Global Skywatch” and “Exposing The New World Order”.
 The captions on posts accompanying the article included “tyranny in progress” and “the COVID-19 virus did not meet the criteria to qualify as a “high consequence infectious disease but they STILL locked it down - STILL think it is NOT about CONTROL?”
 The UK government post was also written up by right-wing US news site The Daily Wire, with the headline “British Government Lowered Its Estimate Of Severity Of Coronavirus LAST WEEK”.
 This article and headline have also been used on social media as supposed evidence of fearmongering by governments
 The misinformation has also been shared by “antivax” groups in the US, and UK Facebook groups sharing debunked claims about 5G mobile phone networks supposedly spreading the coronavirus..
 In the three weeks since the government post was uploaded on March 19, the UK has imposed strict social distancing measures to curb the spread of the virus, and prime minister Boris Johnson is in intensive care having contracted it.
 "HCID is a technical classification with no current implications on how the government is responding to the coronavirus outbreak," a UK government spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.
 “We have always said we will take the right measures at the right time — based on the latest scientific evidence — to slow the spread of the virus, protect vulnerable people, reduce demand on our NHS and save lives.”
 The original Public Health England web page was shared even more widely on Facebook posts in languages other than English, especially German, Russian and Romanian.  
 BuzzFeed News has previously reported on how Facebook has struggled to get a grip on misinformation about the coronavirus that goes viral in other languages.

Iranian health officials cast doubt on Tuesday on China's reporting of its novel coronavirus toll, saying the figures appear to be too low. "After the virus spread, it became evident it wasn't as China reported," said Minoo Mohraz, a health ministry official who is also a member of Iran's coronavirus- fighting taskforce.
 "They're currently retracting many of their articles and their figures and studies have not been very correct," she said, quoted by state news agency IRNA. "With what we know of their scientific studies... their figures are not trustworthy." Another taskforce official said China's figures were "far from the truth", based on COVID-19's spread and high fatalities worldwide.
 Hamid Souri, an epidemiologist, said "distorted data leads to distorted decision-making". Iran's health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour came under fire on Sunday after saying China's reporting of its COVID-19 figures was a "bitter joke".
 He was slammed on Twitter by the Chinese ambassador to Tehran, Chang Hua, who called on him to "respect realities and the great efforts of the people of China", where the pandemic originated. Jahanpour later retreated and tweeted that "China's support of Iran in these trying times is unforgettable".
 Iran-China relations are usually warm as Beijing is one of Tehran's top trade partners, especially in oil sales. Iran says the virus has killed more than 3,800 and infected over 62,500 in the Islamic republic.
 But there has been speculation abroad that the real number of deaths and infections could be higher..

And I miss my regular every-third-Friday hair appointments. My March 27 one was cancelled, compliments of COVID-19. Now, my April appointment is in the trash can. While I understand the precaution, “essential businesses” is in the eye of the beholder. In a couple more weeks I’m going to look like Bigfoot’s sister!
 And, it didn’t help that Monday was my 60th birthday. No, it’s not the age thing. I’m ready for the Big 6-0, and somehow prefer the birthdays that are multiple of fives. I don’t know why. I just like saying I’m 50, 55 or 60, better than 52, 57 or 61.
 Sure, my coworkers did their best – a card, a banner, best wishes, but what I was looking forward to was cutting out of work early (it always feels like skipping school) and having others finish the paper so I could have a few drinks with my editorial board and then have my husband take me out to dinner. Nope, that wasn’t happening, although the husband grilled steaks and we shared a bottle of to-die-for wine we discovered when visiting our older son and daughter-in-law in Scottsdale, Ariz. last year.
 And, this year’s trip to Scottsdale that is scheduled next month is probably in the dumpster, too.
 But then that phone call from my mom and dad came Thursday morning.
 There was a fire at a 3-story apartment building on Army Post Road in Des Moines shortly after midnight Thursday.
 My brother and his wife escaped with their lives, two dogs, a cellphone, and the clothes on their backs. They lost everything in the apartment that they had recently moved into. The new microwave they had purchased was still in the box.
 They are now putting the pieces together better than one would expect, but when hanging up phone Thursday I vowed right there that Robin’s Pity Party would end, right then and there, and thanked God that I have still have a house that I can go stir crazy in.

The second-most serious charge is failing to stop at an accident involving death or personal injury. Because the accident involved a death, the charge is a mid-level felony punishable by a minimum of 31 months in prison.
 Jakee also faces two counts of aggravated endangering a child, for two children allegedly riding with her. It’s unclear if the children were with her during the accident or if they were riding with her and she was allegedly driving under the influence prior to the accident. These charges are low-level felonies.
 Jakee is also charged with two misdemeanors and a traffic infraction. Domestic battery and driving under the influence are the misdemeanors and driving left of center in a no-passing zone is the infraction.
 Judge Johnson then asked Jakee where she worked to determine if she could afford her own attorney. Jakee said she worked for Out and About, a transport service, according to one of her social media pages. She said she was laid off because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The judge appointed JoAnna Derfelt to represent Jakee.
 The judge also asked Deputy Labette County Attorney Mandy Johnson about bond. The prosecutor asked that the $1 million bond in place now remain. Judge Johnson agreed. Mandy Johnson also requested bond supervision. The judge told Jakee that if she were able to make bond that she would be on bond supervision and could be subject to random drug and alcohol testing. He also told her she could not have contact with victims or witnesses.
 Jakee asked about seeing her children. Judge Johnson told her since they are alleged victims that she could not have any contact with them. Jakee said OK.
 The judge didn’t know when the next hearing would be. Court hearings, except for emergencies and first appearances, have been delayed at least until after May 1 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He recommended to Jakee that she contact her attorney.

Arsenal agreed a deal to sign William Saliba last summer, and he looks like the perfect player to build the team around moving forwards.
 The recently-turned 19 year-old has it all. Not only is he fast, agile and quick-thinking in defence, but will be key in switching our stance from defence to attack, and has a long-ball pass that can match even the best.
 Saliba and David Luiz both pinging balls from deep positions next season is going to put teams under immense pressure not to attack in large numbers, and will cause all sorts of trouble to our rivals.
 Our club really looks to have landed a bargain by moving so quickly to land Saliba, and I would not be surprised to see him handed the captain’s armband in the coming years, as he looks mature beyond his years, and appears to have a real influence on those around him.
 Will Saliba be able to hit the ground running in the Premier League? Is Luiz the perfect partner to help him meet his full potential in training and on the pitch?

LONDON -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was stable in intensive care on Tuesday after receiving oxygen support to help him battle COVID-19, while his foreign minister led the government's response to the outbreak.
 Johnson's personal battle with the virus has shaken the government just as the United Kingdom, now in its third week of virtual lockdown, enters what scientists say will be the most deadly phase of the coronavirus pandemic that has already killed at least 6,159 people in the country.
 Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital across the River Thames from parliament late on Sunday after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms, including a high temperature and a cough, for more than 10 days.
 But his condition rapidly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was moved on Monday to an intensive care unit, where the most serious cases are treated, in case he needed to be put on a ventilator. He was still conscious, his office said.
 "He is receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any other assistance," Johnson's spokesman told reporters at an 1100 GMT briefing.
 "The prime minister has been stable overnight and remains in good spirits," the spokesman said. "He has not required mechanical ventilation, or non- invasive respiratory support."
 But the absence of Johnson, the first leader of a major power to be hospitalized after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, has raised questions about who is truly in charge of the world's fifth largest economy at such a crucial time.
 While Britain has no formal succession plan should a prime minister become incapacitated, Johnson asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, 46, to deputize for him "where necessary," Downing Street said. If Raab is incapacitated, finance minister Rishi Sunak would take on those responsibilities.
 Queen Elizabeth wished Johnson a "full and speedy recovery" and sent a message of support to his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, and his family. Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, wished Johnson a speedy recovery.
 WHO LEADS?
 Raab chaired the government's COVID-19 emergency response meeting on Tuesday, though ministers refused to say who had ultimate control over the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons - a role held by the prime minister.
 "There are well-developed protocols which are in place," said Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who himself went into self-isolation on Tuesday after a family member displayed coronavirus symptoms.
 British leaders do not traditionally publicize the results of their medical examinations, as some U.S. presidents including Donald Trump have.
 Raab, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938, takes the helm at a pivotal time. Government scientists see the death toll rising until at least April 12 and Britain must ultimately decide when to lift the lockdown.
 Johnson's move to intensive care added to the sense of upheaval that the coronavirus has wrought as its spread has caused global panic, sowed chaos through financial markets and prompted the virtual shutdown of the world economy.
 The United Kingdom is in a state of almost total lockdown, a situation due to be reviewed early next week. Some ministers have suggested the lockdown might need to be extended, with evidence that some people were using sunny spring weather as an excuse to flout the strict rules.
 The death toll announced on Tuesday had risen by 786 - the biggest daily increase to date.
 The pound dipped in Asian trading on news of Johnson's intensive care treatment but then rallied in London trading. Against the dollar, sterling traded to a high of $1.2349, up 0.9% on the session.
 CRITICISM
 Even before coronavirus, Johnson had had a tumultuous year.
 He won the top job in July 2019, renegotiated a Brexit deal with the European Union, fought a snap election in December which he won resoundingly and then led the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Jan 31 - promising to seal a trade deal with the EU by the end of this year.
 The government has said it is not planning to seek an extension to that deadline in light of the epidemic.
 Johnson has faced criticism for initially approving a much more modest response to the coronavirus outbreak than other major European leaders, though he then imposed a lockdown as projections showed half a million people could die.
 He tested positive for the virus on March 26.
 After 10 days of isolation in an apartment at Downing Street, he was admitted to hospital. He was last seen in a video message posted on Twitter on Friday when he looked weary.

Police arrested Jakee on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter and driving under the influence, according to Kansas Highway Patrol Public Information Officer Rick Wingate. Jakee and Treiber were in a relationship, according to their social media pages.
 According to the KHP, the accident occurred at 9:17 pm April 1 on U.S. 59 (North 16th Street) about four-tenths of a mile south of U.S. 400.
 Jakee was reportedly driving southbound on U.S. 59 just south of Larsen Boulevard located beside the convention center at the new Holiday Inn Express. She passed another southbound vehicle in a no-passing zone then drove partially off the roadway onto the northbound shoulder and struck Treiber, who was walking southbound on the northbound shoulder. Treiber was pronounced dead at the scene.
 Jakee kept driving southbound and law enforcement stopped her 2007 Ford Mustang on U.S. 59 just south of 25000 Road and arrested her.
 Jakee appeared in court via Skype from the Labette County Jail in Oswego early Monday afternoon. Judge Fred W. Johnson reviewed with Jakee the seven-count complaint. The most serious charge is the off grid felony, first-degree murder, which carries a punishment of life in prison. The complaint alleges that Jakee intentionally killed Treiber with the vehicle.

La Premiere ministre Sophie Wilmes a annonce que la Belgique allait se preparer a son deconfinement. "Nous devons plancher des a present sur un scenario de sortie de crise", a-t-elle declare a la Chambre, ce jeudi 2 avril . Pour ce faire, Sophie Wilmes a mis en place un groupe de 10 experts charges de s'occuper de la sortie graduelle du pays de la quarantaine dans laquelle il a ete plonge dans le courant du mois de mars. Parmi les personnes selectionnees, on compte notamment les scientifiques Marc Van Ranst, Emmanuel Andre et Marius Gilbert, sur le devant de la scene depuis le debut de l'epidemie de coronavirus dans notre pays. À la tete de ce groupe d'experts, la Premiere ministre a nomme Erika Vlieghe, cheffe du Service des maladies infectieuses de l'hopital universitaire d'Anvers. Pour le deconfinement a venir, cette derniere a evoque une "strategie de l'accordeon". "Il s'agit d'assouplir les regles pour les renforcer ensuite si le virus se propage a nouveau, a-t-elle detaille a nos confreres de Het Laatste Nieuws. Nous allons devoir l'envisager. Si nous trouvons qu'il y a de nouveau trop de cas, il faudra agir et avoir un plan B." Si elle se veut optimiste en parlant de deconfinement, l'experte n'en garde pas moins les pieds sur terre. "La date du 19 avril serait trop precoce pour un assouplissement des mesures, ajoute-t- elle. Nous l'avions deja dit auparavant. Nous ne sommes qu'en train d'approcher du pic de l'epidemie dans notre pays." Pour ce qui est du timing exact concernant les levees de restrictions, il sera discute dans les jours a venir et meticuleusement elabore par le groupe que preside Erika Vlieghe. À ce jour, la Belgique denombre 22.194 personnes testees positives au coronavirus. Parmi celles-ci, 6.012 ont du etre hospitalisees et 2.035 ont perdu la vie. Certains chiffres presentes quotidiennement par le centre national de crise et le SPF sante publique ont toutefois commence a evoluer dans le bon sens, selon les specialistes. C'est le cas notamment du nombre d'hospitalisations et de contaminations au covid-19. "Les chiffres confirment une diminution de la force de l'epidemie en Belgique, les mesures fonctionnent", avait annonce Emmanuel Andre, le porte-parole interfederal de la lutte contre le covid-19.

She went peacefully in her sleep as she hoped would happen. Our Mom lived for the past year in an apartment at Good Samaritan Society Scandia Village in Sister Bay, WI. Everyone there took such wonderful care of her for which our whole family is eternally grateful. She and our Dad, Jim Heard, Sr, retired to Ellison Bay in Door County, WI 32 years ago from McHenry, IL. They felt this was their Heaven on Earth. Mom did volunteering, was very active with Al-Anon and cared for our Dad who had Parkinson's disease the last 14 years of his life. He preceded her on the journey to heaven eleven years ago. Betty Ann is survived by her children, Betty (Tom) Thompson, Jim (Janet) Heard, Jr, Joyce (Dave) Miller, all from McHenry, IL, John (Vicky) Heard from St. Louis, MO, and Diane (Jeff) Levison, from Pagosa Springs, CO. She will also be deeply missed by her ten grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren with number nine due in August. A Celebration of Life will be held at a later date. In honor of our Mother, donations to the Shepherd of the Bay Memorial Fund (PO Box 27, Ellison Bay, WI 54210), would be greatly appreciated. Casperson Funeral Home & Cremation Services in Sister Bay, WI is assisting the Heard family. Expressions of sympathy, memories, and photos of Betty Ann may be shared with her family through her tribute page at www.caspersonfuneralhome.com .

Johnson has nominated his Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, to deputize for him "as necessary" but there is no recent precedent for a sitting UK prime minister becoming incapacitated for a lengthy period.
 In its daily update to reporters, Downing Street moved to head off concerns, stressing that Raab was running the country from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the support of government officials.
 Raab would chair meetings of the National Security Council if any were needed while he was deputizing for the Prime Minister, a spokesperson said. Raab, 46, and the UK's Cabinet have the authority and ability to respond in the PM's absence on military action, the spokesperson added.
 Decisions relating to Covid-19 would be taken in the usual way through the daily morning meeting, chaired by Raab, and other ministerial groupings. But Raab would not have the power to hire and fire ministers or officials, the spokesperson said.
 Few formal powers are invested specifically in the UK prime minister and key decisions are taken collectively by the Cabinet or its sub-committees. Many statutory powers are held by individual secretaries of state. But in recent decades, holders of the UK's top political office have adopted a more presidential style, and the sweeping nature of the ruling Conservative Party's most recent election victory was attributed to Johnson's personal appeal with voters.
 "The Prime Minister has a team around him who ensure the work of government goes on," a senior Cabinet minister, Michael Gove, told the BBC earlier.
 Buckingham Palace and the Queen have been regularly updated on Johnson's condition. The Prime Minister's two most senior officials, the cabinet secretary and his principal private secretary, will maintain contact with the palace on the Prime Minister's behalf, Downing Street said. But the weekly audiences with the Queen would not continue for the time being.
 The spokesperson said that despite the lack of a formal succession procedure in the UK, there was an established order of ministerial precedence, with the top finance minister, Rishi Sunak following Raab. The "letters of last resort," sealed documents written by the Prime Minister to ballistic missile submarine commanders in cases of a nuclear attack, still stand. "The Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister," the spokesperson said.
 The UK lockdown will remain in place with the government "focussed on stopping the spread of the infection." The spokesperson said that if there were evidence that more needed to be done to slow the rate of transmission, "we would be prepared to do that."
 US President Donald Trump said at a Monday news conference that his administration had been in contact with Johnson's doctors. The spokesperson said the government was "grateful for all of the warm wishes the PM has received overnight" and "confident he is receiving the best care from the NHS. Any treatment he receives is a matter for his doctors."
 Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today program earlier that Johnson was "receiving the very best care" at St. Thomas' Hospital in London, after being taken into intensive care at 7 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) on Monday.
 Gove later said he was self-isolating at home because a member of his family was showing coronavirus symptoms. Gove said on Twitter that he was not displaying any symptoms and was continuing to work.
 The coronavirus has hit the top of the British government hard. The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, said on March 27 that he had the virus, on the same day that chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announced that he would begin self-isolation after displaying Covid-19 symptoms. Neil Ferguson, a top UK government adviser on the virus, said on March 18 he believed he had been infected.
 Various other senior government ministers and advisers have been forced to self-isolate. Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister's senior adviser, who self- isolated soon after Johnson's diagnosis, has not yet returned to work, Downing Street said.
 Gove confirmed that Raab was now in charge of seeing through Johnson's plan to tackle the novel coronavirus. "Dominic [Raab] takes on the responsibilities of chairing the various meetings the PM would've chaired but we're all working together to implement the plan that the PM has set out," he said.
 But Gove sidestepped a question about who held the "nuclear codes," saying he would not discuss national security issues.

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A Canadian company said Monday that it's started construction on the long-stalled Keystone XL oil sands pipeline across the U.S.-Canada border, despite calls from tribal leaders and environmentalists to delay the $8 billion project amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 A spokesman for TC Energy said work began over the weekend at the border crossing in northern Montana, a remote area with sprawling cattle ranches and wheat fields. About 100 workers will be involved in the pipeline's early stages, but that number is expected to swell into the thousands in coming months as work proceeds, according to the company.
 The 1,200 mile (1,930 kilometer) pipeline was proposed in 2008 and would carry up to 830,000 barrels (35 million gallons) of crude daily for transfer to refineries and export terminals on the Gulf of Mexico.
 It's been tied up for years in legal battles and several court challenges are still pending, including one that's due before a judge next week.
 TC Energy's surprise March 31 announcement that it intended to start construction came after the provincial government in Alberta invested $1.1 billion to jump start work. Montana's Department of Environmental Quality on Friday issued the final state permits the company needed, agency spokeswoman Rebecca Harbage said.
 Leaders of American Indian tribes and some residents of rural communities along the pipeline route worry that workers could spread the coronavirus. As many as 11 construction camps, some housing up to 1,000 people, were initially planned for the project, although TC Energy says those are under review because of the virus.

WASHINGTON -- A Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive on Tuesday described as "unfortunate" plans by the U.S. government to curb the Chinese telecom equipment maker's access to global chip supplies.
 Reuters reported last month that senior Trump administration officials agreed to new measures to force foreign chip manufacturers that use U.S. equipment to seek a license before shipping to the blacklisted company.
 Sources said the plan, if finalized, could deal a blow to Huawei and one of its key chip manufacturers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. It could also hit U.S. companies like KLA Corp, Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc, which provide chipmaking equipment.
 Speaking on a webinar, Paul Scanlan, chief technology officer of Huawei's networking business, lamented the news, but appeared to dismiss concerns that the measures could hurt the company in the long run.
 "Relating to things like the U.S. government curtailing exports of chips to Huawei and things like this, and the other components, that is really unfortunate that the world has to go down this route," he said.
 "But we spend $20 billion on (research and development) and that is probably … why we make a lot of money."
 Last month, Huawei reported its weakest annual profit growth in three years for 2019 and predicted the Chinese government would retaliate against new U.S. trade restrictions. (Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Richard Chang)

Norway will lift some of the restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the country's prime minister said on Tuesday.
 "Together we have taken control of the virus, therefore we can open up society little by little," Erna Solberg told a news conference. On Monday, her health minister said the epidemic was "under control" in Norway, pointing to the low rate of transmission of the disease.
 The Nordic country was among the first in Europe to shut down a wide range of private and public institutions to halt the spread of COVID-19, sending the economy into a tailspin and triggering hundreds of thousands of layoffs. Current restrictions, which are in place until April 13, included the closures of nurseries and schools, refusing entry to foreigners who do not live and work in Norway and forbidding people to go to their mountain cabins if they have one.
 Kindergartens will reopen between April 20 and 27; schools from the first grade to the fourth grade will reopen from April 27; and Norwegians can go to their chalets from April 20. At the same time, working from home must continue and Norwegians must get used against measures against contamination "for a long time", Solberg said.

Norway, one of the first European countries to curb activities to rein in the coronavirus, will relax restrictions "little by little", the prime minister said on Tuesday.

At the same time, working from home must continue and Norwegians must get used to measures against contamination "for a long time", Solberg said.
 In addition, major sports and cultural events such as festivals would be banned until June 15. Some 5,863 people had tested positive for the coronavirus as of Tuesday, up from 5,755 reported on Monday, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said. Some 69 people have died of the disease so far.
 Norway's rate of unemployment rose to 15.4% on Tuesday, the Labour and Welfare Agency (NAV) said, the highest level on record, up from 14.7% on March 31, as the economy ground to a halt. Norway is the latest country to ease some of its restrictions.

NEW YORK (AP) — Putting all 30 teams in the Phoenix area this season and playing in empty ballparks was among the ideas discussed Monday by Major League Baseball and the players’ association.The sides held a telephone call to talk about paths forward for a season delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, people familiar with the discussion told The Associated Press. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because no details were announced.Ideas are still in the early stage, and the Arizona option would have many obstacles to overcome, the people said.“MLB has been actively considering numerous contingency plans that would allow play to commence once the public health situation has improved to the point that it is safe to do so," the commissioner's office said in a statement Tuesday. “While we have discussed the idea of staging games at one location as one potential option, we have not settled on that option or developed a detailed plan.”Baseball officials intend to study which options may be viable.“While we continue to interact regularly with governmental and public health officials, we have not sought or received approval of any plan from federal, state and local officials, or the players' association,” MLB said. "We are not ready at this time to endorse any particular format for staging games in light of the rapidly changing public health situation caused by the coronavirus.”Half of the MLB clubs hold spring training in Arizona, the other half in Florida.Arizona’s advantage is 10 spring training ballparks plus the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Chase Field all within about 50 miles. Florida’s spring training ballparks are spread out by as much as 220 miles.“It allows for immediacy of a schedule, where you might be able to begin it and televise it, provide Major League Baseball to America,” said Scott Boras, baseball’s most prominent agent. “I think players are willing to do what’s necessary because I think they understand the importance of baseball for their own livelihoods and for the interest of our country and providing a necessary product that gives all the people that are isolated enjoyment."“It gives them a sense of a return to some normalcy,” Boras added. "You talk to a psychologist about it and they say it’s really good for a culture to have sport and to have a focus like that, where for a few hours a day they can take their minds off the difficult reality of the virus.”Baseball’s season had been set to start March 26 but spring training was halted on March 12. After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended restricting events of more than 50 people for eight weeks, MLB said it would not open until mid-May at the earliest.Texas Rangers president of baseball operations Jon Daniels said MLB is examining different options and he didn’t want to speculate.“But, obviously, we’d all love to find a way to play, provided we could do safely, and that would be the priority,” he said.The players’ association would want to survey its members to determine whether they would support such a plan, one of the people said.“You’re going to be largely separated from your families and you’re going to have to function in a very contained way. It’s not a normal life, this idea,” Boras said. “You’re going to have an identified group of people. You’re going to have a constantly tested group of people. And you’re going to have a very limited access of those people to the outside world so that you can assure a very uncontaminated league, if you will, to produce a product that is inspirational to our country.”Chase Field, with artificial turf and a retractable roof, could be the site of daily tripleheaders, Boras said.MLB and the union reached a deal March 26 to advance $170 million in salary to players for the first 60 days of the season. As part of the deal, players would get only prorated portions of their salaries if the regular season is cut from its usual 162 games and would receive no additional salary if the season is scrapped.Both sides have agreed to attempt to play as full a season as is possible, and this plan would enable the season to start while waiting for health and government officials to determine whether it is safe to resume play in regular-season ballparks, with the travel that would entail.___AP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Texas contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

This plan affects three upcoming public events that are listed below, along with the rescheduled dates. All existing tickets will be honored.
 Operations Manager Bobby Rexroad is doing his part to make sure the theater is sanitized and ready for when normal operations resume.
 "In the absence of events, we've had a great opportunity to make repairs and improvements after our busy first year," Retread said. "We have a chance now to really deep clean and tend to any minor repairs in the facility. Our main goal during this time is to smooth out any challenges we faced in our first year, and ensure we're ready to hit the ground running when this is all over."
 Continued communication with artists, managers, agencies, community organizations, and other stakeholders is paramount to resuming the momentum the Robinson Grand has gained during its first year of business, officials said.
 “The live event industry, similar to many others, has been forced to hit pause during this pandemic,” said Executive Director Ryan Tolley. “While the execution of events has been paused, there is still a frenzy of activity behind the scenes to accommodate rescheduled events and begin planning for the future. We want to ensure that we’re 100% ready when this clears to provide the best entertainment opportunities for the region!”
 The theater previously announced the rescheduling of four other events:
