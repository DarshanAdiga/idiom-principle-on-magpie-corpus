Two weeks after Ontario school boards started implementing distance learning, parents across the province are grappling with the system.
 While some feel like they are hitting their groove when it comes to helping their kids learn from home, others are finding it increasingly challenging to balance distance learning with their other responsibilities.
 "At first, it was really difficult just trying to figure out how to juggle it all with three different kids in three different grades," said Katy Smith, whose children attend McLeod Public School in Sudbury.
 "It was difficult at the beginning, but I discovered that my family really needed structure, and so we developed a schedule that we stick to every day."
 Smith said that she is lucky enough not to be working right now. Her children are in Junior Kindergarten, Grade 2, and Grade 4.
 She had to develop a different schedule that works for each child, which often means facilitating independent study with her oldest son, Jack, working one- on-one with Henry, who has an intellectual disability, and doing different activities with her youngest, George.
 "It has been a huge adjustment for us. When this all started, my husband was put on straight nights and so during the day I was trying to keep everyone quiet while learning at the same time," she said.
 "But we have learned to cope with the challenges. The teachers have been really helpful and they give us nice, engaging activities, like scavenger hunts outside, that aren't hard to do at home and fun for the kids."
 Ginette Bilodeau and her daughter, Gabrielle (who attends École St-Augustin in Garson) are having a different experience.
 Bilodeau is working full-time from home, and trying to help her daughter figure out distance learning at the same time.
 "The morale is definitely down right now, because we are all tired of being stuck in the house. We need a break, and we're trying not to lose our minds," she said.
 "I think distance learning is a good thing to get children through this pandemic, but I can't really see online learning being a positive thing."
 Bilodeau is struggling to make sure that her daughter has enough work for the week. Sometimes, her daughter finishes her weekly assignments in the span of two days, and she is trying to create alternate lessons to keep her busy.
 They are also struggling with the online learning component.
 "It's not all negative, because I am lucky to have a really independent child who is able to do a lot of the work without a lot of assistance, but trying to get everything working online is a challenge, and it seems like there's just too many things to coordinate between my appointments and hers."
 More than anything, Bilodeau said she believes that many parents won't be able to shoulder so much responsibility.
 "I didn't go to school to be a teacher and I never considered homeschooling my daughter, ever. I wouldn't be doing (it) unless it was to ensure her safety."
 Alicia Roy, on the other hand, feels that distance learning has been a rewarding experience from the start.
 "It's been going really well. It's given me the opportunity to work one-on-one with my son, who has some learning challenges, and he hasn't had to struggle to learn the same way he does in a typical classroom setting," she said.
 "My daughter loves to work independently, and she's really enjoying the stuff she's doing right now."
 Her children, Nova and Felix, who are in Grades 6 and 4 at École St-Étienne in Dowling, benefit from private video chats with their teachers and engaging assignments.
 "The most amazing thing that's happened is seeing how amazing the teachers really are. I see my son's teacher interact with him on a daily basis. She understands him so well - to the point that when he's writing, she knows what mistakes he's going to make before he makes them," she said.
 "That has truly touched me in a way I can't explain. To see the way the teachers have connected with my son and daughter on an individual and personal level has touched me to the point that it brings tears to my eyes."
 Roy, who typically works full-time as a dental hygienist, has been homeschooling her children since she was laid off on March 12.
 "I am loving every second of this. What an interesting way of being where you don't have to go anywhere. I get to be with my family. This is something, I think, that we take for granted," she said.
 More than anything, she encourages parents to take it day by day.
 "We learn as we go. Some days, I am better at homeschooling. Other days, I am better at helping them make a cake."
 Norm Blaseg, director of education at the Rainbow District School Board, believes that despite some expected hiccups, distance learning has gotten off to a good start.
 This is, in part, due to a successful survey of students and families completed in the week before to determine which students had access to connectivity and devices that would allow them to learn online.
 "We surveyed both our elementary and secondary students to find out how many homes had internet, and how many homes had appropriate devices," he said.
 "As a result of that survey, we discovered that 97 per cent of our students have internet access. That means, out of 13,500 students, only about 300 do not have internet access. At the end of the day, we discovered that about 2, 000 students needed access to devices - about 1,500 elementary school students, and 500 secondary."
 The school board has access to devices, and it has been following public health protocols to ensure that students get them safely.
 Connectivity issues are more difficult to solve. However, Blaseg said the school board has been working with Eastlink to determine how they can get those families internet access.
 "Distance learning is not for everyone. We are very cognizant of the fact that every family has different thresholds of stress associated with their own situation. We are trying to be supportive of that," he said.
 To help students learn, the school board is trying to use different learning methods to engage with students. This includes interfacing with teachers online, completing assignments on their own time, or receiving paper packages with at-home learning materials.
 "First and foremost, the health and safety of our kids comes first. Student achievement is second," said Blaseg.
 "Every family brings forward a different set of circumstances, and we are working with those families to make sure this works for them. We want to alleviate stress, not add stress, if possible."
 Under the province's declaration of emergency, schools have been ordered to remain closed until at least May 4. Closures could be extended past that date to protect the health and safety of students and staff.
 The Ministry of Education instructed school boards to resume "teacher-led learning" on April 6. As part of their plan, the ministry outlined minimum student expectations, including the amount of hours students in different grades are expected to learn each week.
 Those expectations are modest, especially for the youngest children. From Kindergarten to Grade 6, students are expected to spend five hours a week, or one hour each school day. In Grades 7 and 8, students are to spend 10 hours a week, while in secondary school the expectation is three hours a week for each semestered course and 1.5 hours for each year-long course.

I live in New Rochelle, N.Y., where the COVID-19 first arrived in our state. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered shelter in place, mask use and distancing statewide very quickly. Even so, thousands of New Yorkers have died.
 Your governor, Kristi Noem, has decided to roll the dice with Trump and the lives of the people of South Dakota. In my opinion, as a New Yorker who has seen hundreds die here every day, I believe that every death in South Dakota from the day Gov. Noem made that decision on is on her forever. Blind obedience to Trump’s ignorance and narcissism has proven to be deadly. He blames state governors, the World Health Organization, Democrats, President Obama, China, the media and has spewed out the outrageous proclamation that he “is not responsible.”
