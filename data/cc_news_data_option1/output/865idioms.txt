BRUSSELS -- OPEC's proposal to cut oil production by up to 1 million barrels per day is enough to balance the market and lift oil prices back to $60 per barrel, Leonid Fedun, vice-president of Russia's second-biggest oil producer Lukoil, told Reuters.
 "Conoravirus… is a short-lived factor which is affecting oil prices… There will be an OPEC (and non-OPEC) meeting, compensatory measures will be taken which will take the excess oil off the market and oil price will rebound," Fedun said.
 "We are ready to cut (our oil production) as much as we are told to. Better to sell less oil but at a higher price." (Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin Additional reporting by Olesya Astakhova Writing by Katya Golubkova Editing by Louise Heavens)

Short-term rentals in Sarnia will need to have primary residents living in the properties at all times to be licensed.
 But existing - as of Jan. 1, 2020 - Airbnb-like rentals in the city will be exempt from that requirement.
 A whole-council committee approved the city staff recommendations Monday after last month voting to put in place rules around licencing by April and subjecting the properties to the four per cent municipal accommodation tax.
 "What we did here today was a lot of good," said Coun. Bill Dennis, who's called since last summer for regulation such as the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal-tested rules recently adopted in Toronto.
 "Every community pretty much in Ontario and North America is doing exactly what we're doing," Dennis said. "There has to be some regulation."
 The largely single-detached residential rentals for fewer than 30 days have come under fire as nuisance properties in some Sarnia neighbourhoods and an encroachment on long-term housing stock.
 They've essentially become commercial properties operating in residential zones, city planning director Stacey Forfar said in a report to council.
 The new licensing system requires annual licensing, fire and planning and building inspections, restricting the number of available rooms to three, and at least four parking spaces. These provisos,  along with the principal- resident requirement, makes them home-based businesses, she said.
 The "grandfathering" clause that existing short-term rentals need not have a primary resident is a major concession, Dennis said, noting Sarnia may be one of the only municipalities to make it.
 "I wanted to be fair," he said. "I know those people. They're business people. They've put money into that."
 Council voted 6-2 in a recorded vote in favour of the measure, with Mayor Mike Bradley and Coun. Mike Stark opposed. Coun. Brian White was absent.
 Lisa Maola, who operates several properties with Sarnia Stays, said the grandfathering clause is better than nothing, but she still wasn't pleased with the primary-resident requirement.
 "Our purchasing plans would definitely evolve with that as well," she said, calling the council decision blind to the full impact to the local community.
 "It also means that perhaps expansion plans do not include Sarnia," she said.
 Cheaper than hotels, the rentals have been used for transient workers, vacations, family reunions, tourism during community festivals and events, or by prospective residents while shopping for real estate, operators have said. The industry has led to investment in otherwise unused and derelict properties, operators have noted.
 Rezoning for properties on a case-by-case basis can still be considered by council.
 The grandfathering clause stays with the property, even if it's sold, which could potentially lead to bad actors in the system in the future, council has heard.
 Principal residents who want to rent their entire home while they are away can do so for up to and including 180 days, Forfar said.
 Another proposed rule that would have restricted rentals to half the year for operators living at the property year-round was previously scrapped.
 Grandfathered properties are not exempt from the remaining 180-day rule, or any other licensing requirement, save the one requiring a primary resident, city solicitor Sutheat Tim said.
 Dennis, a local real estate agent, said he's received flak from his peers in the business for looking to crack down on short-term rentals.
 "They felt like I was attacking the industry," he said. "I explained to them, when I walk into this building 'I'm a city councillor. I have a fiduciary duty to the citizens of Sarnia and the taxpayers, not to the real estate industry.'"
 Plans are also to look at a greater strategy for rooming and boarding houses in the community, Forfar said, as Coun. Margaret Bird noted longer-term rentals are also leading to problem properties
 More information is expected at council's March 23 meeting, Forfar said.

Tanzania Media Women Association (Tamwa) executive director Rose Reuben says they expect the country to invest in women and girls because they are the part development.
 “If the country will focus on economic empowerment it will set a direct path towards gender equality to eradicate poverty and inclusive economic growth,” she said.
 According to her, women make huge contributions to the economy of the country whether in businesses, on farms, entrepreneurships, employees, leadership or doing unpaid care work at home unfortunately, they remain extremely affected by poverty, discriminated and exploited.
 “The government has made progress on several issues to eliminate violence against women, increase number women leadership but a lot more was still needed to be done,” she said.
 Dr Reuben stressed that gender discrimination limits access to economic assets such as land and loans, limits participation in shaping the economy and social policies.
 “This year Form Four exams saw number of girls attaining good marks in their final exams but, most of them who passed with flying colours are those with parents capable to send children in private schools,” she said.
 She noted that as they were going to mark 25 of Beijing declaration, they expect women to contest for several leadership posts instead of waiting to be appointed or be given special seats because if they are appointed it becomes difficult for them to make decisions and manage things on their own.
 She further explained number of women in senior leadership was not bad but, more women need to vie for the positions.
 She urged women not to sit back as relax for government officials to appoint them for special seats….. “As we mark 25 years of Beijing Declaration, we also expect women in constituency to go for leadership positions.”
 Ms Magreth Chilumba said though she was not aware about the Beijing declaration review, when it comes to gender issues, women are the most affected compared to men.
 The resident of Ubungo Kibangu explained that women spend more time doing household responsibilities than men. In particular they have primary responsibities, for instance in areas with water challenges they take the task of water collection and firewood.
 “For instance, in the village I come from in Mtwara, health facilities have been improved than it was in the past, so far the government has done a tremendous job,” she said.
 Despite, such efforts some women speak about the achievements made by Tanzania and several African countries, though a lot is needed to be done to enable women and girls attain their dreams.
 African Women’s Development and Communication Network (Femnet) executive director Ms Memory Kachambwa told Woman that resourcing feminism policies and rights that would help people with disabilities, children, youth and women should be a priority for Africa to progress.
 According to her, African Head of States should adopt feminism policies to help improve gender equality and Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights SRHR) related issues.
 She further said the government should consider providing microfinances loans with small interest lending rates to women because most of them do not have own big businesses to enable them pay back with high interest rate.
 According to her, a lot of declarations and ratifications have been signed but not much has changed about women as most African countries still face challenge of early marriages, rape, sexual violence against girls and women were still high. Ms Kachambwa stressed that this year would will be the launch of new decade 2020/30 for African heads of states to make commitments on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
 “We expect issues that affect girls, and women would be included....issues related to micro- lending funding, policies climate, gender, disability and diversity would be prioritized,” she said.
 She said that Sweden, Canada and France are the only countries that adopted feminism policies and for a long time these countries have become champions of gender equality domestically and internationally regardless of political party in government.
 In 2015, the Association of Tanzania workers (ATE) initiated a program dubbed “Female Future Tanzania” to support women in leadership after discovering that only 35 per cent of women in the country hold senior leadership positions.
 The program run in collaboration with the Eastern and Southern Africa Management Institution and help women climb the ranks in business or politics by offering them the kind of leadership training they would have trouble accessing on their own.
 The BPfA underscores commitment made at global, regional and sub regional levels to ending discrimination, promoting women’s rights and advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment. The review will include an assessment of current challenges that affect the implementation of the Platform for Action and the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and its contribution towards the full realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
