My final point is that I’ve written quite a bit. I’ve got six or seven decent- size books that I’ve written. I’ve often found writing solid work, hard work, because I always had a job and had to do it either as one small part of the job or generally in my free time. But I found it surprisingly easy to write when I was in jail. Now I think the literary form is congenial to me. For 13 years I wrote a weekly column in the _Daily Telegraph_ , which is the biggest circulation paper in Australia, and it’s a slightly similar genre. Nonetheless, I found it easy to write.

(AP) – Without any in-school special education services for months, 14-year-old Joshua Nazzaro’s normally sweet demeanor has sometimes given way to aggressive meltdowns that had been under control before the pandemic.The teenager, who has autism and is nonverbal, often wanted no part of his online group speech therapy sessions, and when he did participate, he needed constant hands-on guidance from aides hired by his family. He briefly returned to his private Denville, New Jersey, school for two days a week, but surging coronavirus infections quickly pushed learning back online through at least Dec. 10.Some of Josh’s progress “has been undone, and there are no plans to make it up,” said Sharon MacGregor, who has been involved in the boy’s care since she began dating his father several years ago.Paraprofessional Jessica Wein helps Josh Nazzaro stay focused while attending class virtually from his home in Wharton, N.J., Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2020.The same frustrations are shared by many of the nation’s 7 million students with disabilities — a group representing 14% of American schoolchildren. Advocates for these students say the extended months of learning from home and erratic attempts to reopen schools are deepening a crisis that began with the switch to distance learning in March.Some schools have prioritized high-needs students in reopening plans, bringing small numbers of them back to campuses that otherwise are sticking with distance learning. But those options have only fueled further anguish when they have been reversed because of the virus, and educators say personalized video sessions remain poor substitutes for classroom experience.Alarmed by their children’s setbacks in skills and behaviors, parents are pursuing legal challenges and requesting makeup services. Many worry that the ground lost will be impossible to recover.“Regression is something that will be very, very hard to recuperate from,” said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.In a move that seemed to acknowledge the importance of in-person learning, New York City announced Sunday that it will reopen the nation’s largest school system to in-person learning, including programs serving special-needs students at all grade levels. The announcement marked a major reversal after New York schools were shut down because of rising COVID-19 cases.School districts have also struggled to deliver guaranteed services such as physical therapy that must be done in person or that require equipment, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office.To his family’s relief, sixth-grader Griffin Stinner returned to school four days a week in mid-October when special education students were among the first to return to the Kenmore Town of Tonawanda Union Free School District in western New York state. But it did not last. Shortly before Thanksgiving, the district announced it would revert to fully remote learning because of the region’s rising virus caseload.Griffin’s mother, Dawn, a teacher who is leading her preschool class of 4- and 5-year-olds remotely, called the situation “frustrating beyond belief.” After the initial shutdown in the spring, Griffin, who is nonverbal and has autism, would put on his shoes after breakfast to await the bus and cry over the loss of routine.His mother would stand next to him and sign him in and out of lessons on a computer multiple times a day. “It was just really hard for him to grasp the concept that this was school,” she said.Having to pivot again is “going to be a huge disruption in his life,” she said.The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act guarantees a free public education to children with disabilities and allows for “compensatory” services if a state education agency, in response to a complaint, determines that more needs to be done. Now parents are starting to make requests.“It is becoming a major issue for our local directors,” said Phyllis Wolfram, executive director of the Council of Administrators of Special Education, or CASE.To make up every hour lost — on top of providing services going forward — would be impossible. Educators will need to make individual decisions based on where a student is today, compared with their status before services stopped or changed, she said.Speech pathologist Tara Kirkpatrick said the video sessions she conducts from her Comal, Texas, school office bear little resemblance to speech therapy delivered face to face. On video, she cannot tap a student’s desk to get them back on track.Still, she believes teachers and families are doing their best under the circumstances.“It’s not ideal ... and there’s nothing that we can do about that right now,” she said.Not everyone agrees. A federal class-action lawsuit that named every state education department in the country sought a court order to either immediately reopen schools for students with special needs or issue vouchers for parents who have had to leave jobs or hire outside help to fill in the gaps.A judge in New York City dismissed the suit, ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction, but not before more than 500 families in 35 states had moved to sign on.“It’s a horror what’s going on,” said attorney Patrick Donohue, who filed the complaint and plans to appeal its dismissal. “We have kids who were walking, now aren’t walking. Kids who were talking, now aren’t talking. Kids who didn’t have any potty-training issues, now they’re not potty-trained.”Older students aging out of services will not have time to recover, Donohue said. Federal law entitles students with disabilities educational services up to the age of 21.Educators, Wolfram said, share parents’ concerns about students falling behind, but they are “at the mercy of the pandemic” and the rules adopted by governors and health departments.Even fully reopening schools will not be enough, she said.“It’s going to depend a lot on the resources that are available,” she said, citing potential help from local, state and federal governments. “And do we have the staff to do it? There are a lot of obstacles.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Next day, I realized the $20 I’d intended to humbly give the Lord was actually the $400 intended for a non-deity. What could I do … checks were going to bounce? I called Pastor Tim and explained it was all a mistake that needed to be rectified if at all possible. Mr. Morrow didn’t sound all that cheerfully receptive and explained it would have to be brought before the board of the struggling little ministry. I felt bad, but I was dug in by necessity.          Well, eventually the wrong was righted and I came out looking like the guy who extorted money from God, which obviously doesn’t look good on a Judgment Day resume. Hopefully buying a machine I didn’t really want to help a couple in need will be considered and I’ll make the cut, even if barely.          So here all these years later, there is Pastor Morrow sitting near good friend Tish Cowan and I – bonded for life by a mutual dog passion. As we walked by Tim’s table, I said, “Mr. Morrow, I’d like to make a contribution to your church. Of course, I will expect it back soon.”          That embarrassing faux pas is a long-running gag between me and the affable preacher, who coincidentally is now pastor of my brother Jess and Marti’s Powell church. In retrospect, a good time was had by one and all, but I still to this day can’t recall the wife’s name and have never once used that cobweb-draped weight machine in my basement.

Nevertheless, the trappers’ association argues, “it is a fact trapping will die anyway as a result of bleeding from a thousand cuts.”                  Robertson of Wyoming Untrapped, although pleased with the commission’s action Wednesday, had told commissioners the department’s recommendations “for the most part … don’t go far enough.” Wyoming Untrapped sought more expansive trap-free areas, daily trap checks and the non-target reporting.                  Schmid appeared wary of an ongoing campaign against trapping and tangled with Robertson. He asked whether deer mutilated by dogs should be reported as non-target animals and told her that trappers operate under regulations while “your group has none.”                  He asked what else pet owners could do to prevent injuries from traps.                  Robertson pointed to pet-owner workshops, encouragement to have pets under control and other outreach. “We think we’ve given just about all we can give,” Robertson said.                  “We think it’s now the turn of the trapping community,” she said. “We need traps off our trails.”                  Existing regulations are not based on science, veterinarian Donal O’Toole told the board. The agency report to the commission lacked references to other states’ regulations, to professional organizations and to the scientific literature, he said.                  “I think the key determinant [in forming a regulation] is what trappers find most convenient,” O’Toole said. “It doesn’t take into account the animal’s welfare.”                  Sixteen states require checks every 24 hours for all traps, he said. American veterinarians oppose leg-hold traps, mammalogists say they should be checked twice a day and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies urges trappers to check traps daily “to reduce suffering” and free non-target animals, O’Toole said.                  Several commenters said trapping is wrongly characterized as a management tool because Game and Fish does not require enough reporting and collect enough data to make the pursuit a science-based program.                  Riverton veterinarian Gunda Gamble told the commission of treating pets’ damaged limbs.                  “We talk to the families,” she said, “see the devastation it causes for years.”                  If pet owners caused such injuries, the owners would probably be charged with abuse and neglect, Gamble said.                  Laramie resident Ed Koncel told of his dog’s foot being crushed by a trap, having to carry her a mile and a half back to a trailhead at Pole Mountain, and having no recourse for recouping vet bills. Trappers should be responsible for the cost of treating injured non-target pets like his dog, he said.                  Scott Johnson, who said he operates a wildlife-friendly ranch near Sheridan, asked commission members how they might feel if their pet was trapped. “How long would you want them in there, suffering and dying?” he said.                  In an era of synthetic materials that have replaced fur, trappers, Johnson said, “are living in the past.”                  Trappers disagree. The state association seeks to “maintain the public image of trapping as a legitimate, desirable and compatible enterprise, of modern man… protection and restoration of our natural and historical heritage,” its website states.

Black Friday. If we exclude this unusual year, shopping has changed exponentially over the years. Brick and mortar stores struggle. Online shopping has exploded with more sites out there than we will ever know about or be able to figure out. I remember when shopping was an experience and one dressed up to suit the occasion, Black Friday was only Friday, and sales were truly sales.          Now, shopping is a necessity or casual activity done on a personal device while doing something else, not a special outing to look for that special something.          News programs. Well, the number of truly journalistic news programs is admittedly few and far between. I remember when the news divisions of media organizations were really news divisions. Now, they’re under the entertainment umbrella, which is fitting since that is their purpose – to offer targeted entertainment and create “stars” where the lines between fiction and non-fiction are intentionally blurred to suit the audience.          Unfortunately, most consumers are still fooled into thinking they are being provided the unvarnished truth and facts when, in fact, they are being fed what a few think will get them higher ratings and fatter paychecks.          At a time when many of us forget that many are struggling to have just the basics to get by in life – a roof, food, warm clothing, diapers, job – there are some who feel they are being inconvenienced with mask requirements. We need to remember that, sometimes, there is too much.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — About 750 gallons (2,800 liters) of diesel and water have been cleaned up after an Alaska oil spill that state Department of Environmental Conservation officials said occurred during a fuel tank transfer.
 State conservation officials said the Nov. 25 spill in the village of Selawik happened after workers started transferring fuel from a city fuel tank to a water treatment plant tank. The reasons for the spill and the amount spilled is still under investigation, officials said.
 “We know that 35,000 gallons is still in the tank and is not threatening to release at this time," said Sarah Moore, a state conservation agency spokesperson. "So we have a ballpark estimate, but are still working on some more concrete numbers about the volume spilled."
 The incident was reported to state conservation officials at about 1:30 a.m. last Thursday.
 The spill happened about 600 feet (183 meters) from the Selawik River, a source of water for the village.
 The fuel tank holds just under 46,000 gallons (147,000 liters) of diesel while the water plant tank holds about 4,000 gallon (15,000 liters), Alaska's Energy Desk reported.
 U.S. Coast Guard officials arrived in the village on Tuesday to provide equipment and investigate the cleanup.
 “In addition to investigating the causal factors of the incident, we are on site to assess any potential environmental impacts,” said Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Dane Grulkey in a statement. “We are assisting our community and agency partners organize a safe, effective and coordinated response.”

Biden is looking for a new approach on China: after a 2011 visit he declared that "a rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large." Now his team will spend its opening months rounding up a hands-across-the-water mix of democratically minded Pacific and European allies to check China's expansionism. The size of their combined markets--more than half the world's economy-- will lay down "a marker that says, if you continue to abuse the system in the following ways, there will be consequences," says Biden's incoming National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan.
 That will require undoing some of the damage of the past few years, to offset China's growing regional influence without devolving into conflict. "If we invest in ourselves, invest in our relationships with our allies, and play this key role in international institutions," Sullivan says, "there is no reason why we cannot effectively manage the China challenge in a way that avoids the downward spiral into confrontation." -- _K.D. and W.J.H./Washington and Charlie Campbell/Beijing_

Disney is a great company that's temporarily grappling with pandemic fallout. But it has tremendous potential ahead. The company is showing sequential improvement, and its share price will likely rise. The real question is when. Chapek said, "We now do see some light at the end of the tunnel." If restrictions ease and parks open, and Disney outperforms during the holidays, investor confidence will push its stock price higher. I would buy and lock in the decreased price now. It may be the last time to buy shares on sale.

My journey of quizzing has been running in parallel with my journey of public speaking and theatrics. When you are publicly speaking, quizzing gives you the necessary input to give information along with your speaking prowess. At the same time, when you are quizzing, you need to also be confident about making a wild guess, which may or may not work out. But, there is always sheer joy in getting something right which you have guessed, while you were trying to work out the nuts and bolts of the right answer. I think I developed an interest fairly early in my life, in class 5.

I think it’s a great argument for theism, because there’s not ultimate justice for many, many people in this life, although everybody’s blessed to some extent. Many are blessed in ways that I might not appreciate. But by the same token, there are many people who suffer. Think of all the slaves, all the people who are badly treated, modern-day slavery and certainly in the old days. God will balance that out in the next life.

As I was sorting through one of my closets, I realized I have too many bags, too many shoes and too many sweaters.          We all have fetishes. Mine are the above three. Well, I might have a few more, but let’s leave it there right now. George believed one couldn’t have too many screwdrivers. Any trip to the hardware store meant one or two added to his toolbox. I wondered if sometimes there can be too much of a good thing.          This query I posed to myself persisted when I decided to figure out what Christmas movies I was planning to watch over the next few weeks. I’m usually a day late and dollar short and still remember when Christmas movies were few and special. Much to my ultimate dismay, I realized there are dozens of Christmas movies playing non-stop on television.

Another consolation was that it was a terrible blow when I was found guilty, a worse blow when the supreme court in Victoria found against me — an extraordinary decision in any sense. I really half-seriously considered not going on with my appeal. Then I thought if the judges are just going to close ranks and just make stupid and thoroughly mistaken decisions, it cost a hell of a lot of money for my friends to have to raise for me to go ahead and make the effort. If it’s going to be an expensive charade, I’m probably better out of it.
