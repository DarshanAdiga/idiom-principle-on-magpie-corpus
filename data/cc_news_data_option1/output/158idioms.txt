By virtue of UW’s missed free throws and timely baskets by UNLV’s Nick Blair and Marvin Coleman, the Rebels trailed by just 2 points with 12 seconds to play. Tillman went up for a basket at the rim as the shot clock expired and, for all intents and purposes, the game appeared over after he was unable to get his shot off before the buzzer. Redshirt sophomore guard Hunter Maldonado was called for a foul, though, much to the astonishment of Edwards and the announced crowd of 3,000 fans at Arena-Auditorium. Tillman hit his free throws and turned the game on its head.
 “In the midst of games, some of those calls don’t get called. And you will often hear a lot of people say, ‘Let the players win the basketball game.’ I’m not saying swallow your whistle … if he got clobbered? I get it. But there was a lot of commotion down there, a lot of bodies,” Edwards said. "But you know what? They made the call, and their kid stepped up to the line and put both of them in.”
 With Saturday’s loss, UW remains the only team in the Mountain West without a conference win. On the heels of an 8-24 season a year ago, the Cowboys find themselves in an eerily similar situation as 2020 starts. Hendricks is not worried about things snowballing from here, however. He believes that, despite the pain of this loss, UW took a step forward Saturday. Now, it’s about finishing.
 “We’ve shown all year we have the ability to bounce back” Hendricks said. “We’ll all be alright. We’re all really confident in ourselves. We’re trusting the process.
 “It’s frustrating, but we still have to come in and work every day, and that’s what we do. We come into practice and work our butts off every day wanting to get better, wanting to get wins. And we do everything we can to get a win. And sometimes, it just doesn’t work out.”

On the stump, Booker emphasized his Midwestern connections — often referencing the nearly 80 family members he has still living in Iowa when he campaigned there — and delivered an exhortation to voters to use “radical love” to overcome what he considered Trump's hate. But he rarely drew a contrast with his opponents on the trail, even when asked directly, and even some of Booker's supporters worried his message on Trump wasn't sharp enough to go up against a Republican president known for dragging his opponents into the mud.

An early focus on building out a strong and seasoned campaign operation in Iowa and South Carolina may have hampered his campaign in the long run, as the resources he spent early on staff there left him working with a tight budget in the later stages of the primary, when many of his opponents were going on air with television ads. That meant that even later in the campaign, after he had collected some of the top endorsements in Iowa and visited South Carolina almost more than any other candidate, a significant portion of the electorate in both states either said they were unfamiliar with his campaign or viewed him unfavorably.

“My teammates trusted me with the basketball and my shot came pretty easy when we moved the basketball like we did to start the game and then later in the third quarter,” Ward said.
 Gibson paced the Tigers with 17 points, all scored in the first three quarters, and also pulled down six rebounds. Parr followed with nine points and Craig Fleck added eight.
 “I felt we guarded Riley pretty decently during most of the game, but he’s a good player and good players are going to make tough shots,” Stiverson said. “We stopped switching on him in the fourth quarter and kept Jason Sailor defending him, and Jason did a nice job of staying with him and contesting everything.”
 Both teams hit the road on Tuesday for non-league competition, as the Braves (8-4, 4-2) play their first game in Miami Trace’s new digs and the Tigers (2-9, 0-6) take on Huntington.
 • Logan Elm’s reserve team improved to 11-0 on the season with a 75-21 win over Circleville.
 David Harden was 12 of 14 (85.7 percent) for a game-high 25 points, Tanner Holbert and Xavier Kellough followed with 12 apiece and Braylen Baker added 11.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 77-year-old lifelong politician, offers primary voters a safe and familiar option while emphasizing a pragmatic approach to governing. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 78, is embracing his status as a democratic socialist and the only top-tier candidate who would fight to replace the private health insurance market with a government-backed universal system immediately after taking office. Warren, 70, is careful to describe herself as a capitalist, but she also has a record fighting corporations and agrees with Sanders' call to transform the nation's political and economic systems. And Pete Buttigieg, a 37-year-old Midwestern former mayor who is openly gay and served in the military, represents dramatic change on paper but is more aligned with Biden on policy.

Bahiano es sinónimo de reggae en la Argentina desde la década del ‘80, cuando junto a otros músicos fundó Los Pericos. Acaba de sacar "Original Roots", su quinto disco solista. El nombre remite a las raíces del género, pero él se quiere despegar de cualquiera idea dogmática en torno a esa música.
 "Le puse al disco un nombre en inglés, que en realidad surgió de una muletilla que solía usar en los shows en vivo. Aunque puede remitir a las bases del reggae, no pensé en las raíces ni en Jamaica como fuente. Otra de las frases que usaba es ‘pura adrenalina’", dijo, poco antes de iniciar su recital en Espacio Clarín.
 Las canciones del disco -que tiene como invitados a Fidel Nadal y a Cucho Parisi- tienen un tono luminoso, incluso en temas que hablan de desamor y otros tragos amargos. Bahiano dice que ampliar los límites poéticos del reggae siempre fue una de sus prioridades.
 "Siempre fui bastante nostálgico a la hora de escribir. Quizás un poco más melódico de lo que suele ser el género. Es mi estilo y no voy a dejar de hacerlo de esa manera. En cuanto a la poética, mucha gente cree que el reggae tiene que tener, necesariamente, letras que hablen de religión y del mundo rastafari. Si ves programas de televisión de otros países, hay realities con bandas que hacen reggae religioso, por dar un ejemplo de la diversidad que tiene el género".
 Bahiano lleva más de treinta años de experiencia para hablar del tema.

He once was in the running to play Marvel's "Doctor Strange," but instead he wound up portraying Batman's greatest villain and, as a result, captured a Golden Globe.
 The buzz from Joaquin Phoenix's recent Golden Globe win for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama -- he portrays the skinny, dangerous, sometimes-dancing title character in director Todd Phillips' gritty, R-rated "Joker" -- is still being heard and felt, and it's easy to see and hear why. One screening of the newly released "Joker" DVD and Bluray will reveal the amazing effort by Phoenix as DC Comics' most famous supervillain.
 Running at 122 minutes, "Joker" serves as an origin story of sorts for Gotham City's Clown Prince of Crime. Known as Arthur Fleck, Phoenix's character is a clown for hire, taking jobs that call for him visiting children in hospitals and holding store signs on busy street corners.
 Fleck's dingy surroundings -- careless co-workers, overhead fluorescent lights that frequently go dark, a needy mother (Frances Conroy) and subway passengers who would rather inflict injuries upon Fleck than simply ignore him -- seemingly fuel Fleck's deteriorating mental state. Fleck longs to be loved, or at least liked, but most of those Fleck sees around him are faceless, cold- hearted strangers.
 Feeling invisible, Fleck tries to push on through life, hoping to become a standup comedian and catch the attention and respect of his idol, a famous talk-show host (Robert De Niro). When three rich-looking hoods jump Fleck, it's the first time Fleck lashes out against an attacker. At first, he's terrified of his drastic, law-breaking reaction. Minutes later, however, Fleck's panting disappears, his back straightens and he seems to enjoy his new-found confidence.
 One of the most gripping moments in "Joker" happens when Fleck visits the property of a wealthy, influential family. Fleck's interaction with one of the family members, which takes place through the gaps of a massive, wrought-iron gate, is absolutely chilling.
 When released in theaters back in October, some individuals almost immediately complained of the violent nature of "Joker," although the tense drama contains less gore than what was found during the last 25 minutes of Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood." There's blood in "Joker," as well as a few F-bombs, but Phillips never lets the violence and profanity run rampant.
 A shot late in the film is highly reminiscent of the concluding moments of 1972's "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes." Like Caesar the ape in "Conquest ... ," Phoenix's Joker is seen standing tall above a chanting, near-rabid mob. Cars have been smashed and flames dance throughout portions of the crowded streets.
 Thankfully, Phillips opted to soften the ending of "Joker" for audiences. A rough cut of the film reportedly had Phoenix using broken shards of glass to cut his cheeks to create a bloody, permanent grimace. Instead, the final film actually has Phoenix standing motionless before feeling the inside of his mouth with fingers. After pulling his blood-stained fingers out of his mouth, he uses the blood to mark a faux smile over his makeup-covered face.
 Only a couple flaws hamper the otherwise-strong "Joker." Oddly, Phillips opted to incorporate the weak, plodding, overused Gary Glitter song, "Rock and Roll Part 2," into the movie soundtrack during the first moments when Arthur goes full-blown Joker. Having Fleetwood Mac's percussion-heavy "Tusk" or Humble Pie's wonderfully rambunctious "30 Days in the Hole" blast as Phoenix dances and struts down an empty, outdoor staircase would have been a better, much- more exciting choice.
 But oh boy, does Phoenix look fantastic -- and most definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination -- in the final minutes of "Joker" as a brightly colored three-piece suit drapes itself across his lanky, limber frame. Fleck's long, messy hair is slicked back and colored green. His previous limp and insecure glances have totally vanished, giving way to a mastermind criminal who struts like a banty rooster, ready to be dangerous -- and ready to fight Batman one day.
 Final grade: B+

It took Logan Elm less than two minutes to change the complexion of a Mid- State League Buckeye Division game on Saturday afternoon to post a 51-40 win over visiting Circleville.
 The Braves were clinging to just a two-point lead late in the third quarter, following a three-pointer by Circleville’s Brandon Parr, but answered by scoring on their final three possessions of the period.
 Jason Sailor started the quick spurt by draining a pair of free throws, Luke Baldwin then knocked down a three-pointer from the right wing and Isaac Ward finished the run with an old-fashioned three-point play to give the Braves a 41-31 lead going into the fourth quarter.

 The following is the most recent installment of the Concord Journal/Wicked Local Concord Volunteer of the Week, where we spotlight members of the community who have made significant contributions as volunteers.
 This week the spotlight is on Concord resident Charlie Barker, who volunteers at Emerson Hospital.
 Can you explain your volunteer work?
 In transport, we're involved in many duties, from discharging patients in wheelchairs to helping a nurse with a patient in a bed or a stretcher, delivering medical prescription in the hospital, and delivering patient lab work to the lab for analyzing.
 How did you get started?
 Upon retirement, I had extra time on my hands and wanted to give back to the community. Volunteering at Emerson Hospital in transport was my decision. I started my volunteering at Emerson back in January 2007 and have been there ever since, with the exception of a medical leave I had to take in part of 2018 and 2019. I look forward to returning to two days a week in 2020.
 What keeps you coming back?
 The patients, staff, and volunteers that I meet in transport are so rewarding for me that when I come home after a volunteer shift I feel so warm-hearted from giving back. I have received so much in return, especially after the great care I was given at Emerson in 2018 and 2019 from my multiple medical problems.
 What is/was your profession?
 I was in the analog photography profession (not digital) I took photos in a studio, did photo work for the Boston Public Library, the Museum School, Historical Society of Boston, and I also managed a photo processing plant, processing film for Digital Equipment and other companies.
 What is your life like in Concord? Family? Children? Lifelong resident or recent arrival?
 I was born and raised in Concord in 1943 at Emerson Hospital in what was known as the cottage in front of today's main entrance. I went through the Concord Public Schools system, followed by two years of college in business and photo courses, and 23 years in the Massachusetts National Guard. I have one married brother and I still live in the family homestead. I never married but life has been good to me.
 If you are interested in volunteering at Emerson Hospital, contact the hospital's volunteer office at 978-287-3200 for information and to apply.
