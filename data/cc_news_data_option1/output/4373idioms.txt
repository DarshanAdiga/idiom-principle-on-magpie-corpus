No, and no matter how many times it gets written as a plea on social media, Marco Andretti isn’t going to retire. And that’s not how you go out, right? There are zero sports movies made where a team, or player reaches rock bottom… and quits. Fade to black… roll the credits. Just isn’t how the story goes. If and when Andretti decides to hang up his helmet, it should come after a year where black clouds and an endless supply of cartoon anvils went unused. (The other item that gets missed in the calls for his replacement is that he’s a co-owner of the car he drives, so unless he wants to fire himself, it isn’t happening.)

Timing and scoring went down in qualifying. A 30-minute delay ensued. Drivers were disqualified from advancing to the Fast 12 for various reasons. Their teams offered evidence pointing towards innocence. Drivers were un- disqualified and placed back in the Fast 12. Drivers who were promoted to the Fast 12 due to the DQs were later told to exit their cars as the guilty received clemency. The pace car ran out of fuel. A driver spun under yellow, then pulled onto the circuit and speared a teammate while ruining his own day, which seemed destined for a podium. An entire team, barring one of its five cars, went from a potential 1-2-3 to diving from the roof into an empty pool. The polesitter crashed on his own, and then threw away a $1000 HANS device for good measure. The race’s dominant driver crashed on his own in the same spot. He didn’t throw his HANS.

One of the many casualties of this pandemic: the humble car show. We miss poking around a parking lot full of oddities, bracing ourselves against brisk early mornings with good conversation and a steaming mug of coffee.
 Thankfully, YouTuber Noriyaro brought us this video from a rotary car show in Japan. It's exactly as whacky as you'd expect it to be; Japan's notorious passion writ large across the candy-apple paint and hyper customization on display here. And no culture does the rotary engine better than the Japanese. Mazda supported the show with their infamous, all-conquering 787B Le Mans racer. Elsewhere, there are RX-7 and RX-8 of every flavor, and even a rotary- swapped Caterham (!!!!). The video is a delightful peak into an alternative engine subculture within our own subculture.
 We long to return to pre-pandemic life, so we might get to enjoy scenes like this in the near future. Until then, we'll be pricing out four-rotor RX-7 builds in a detailed Excel spreadsheet. See you in a chilly parking lot sometime soon.

A simple appreciation for the enormity of Pato O’Ward’s achievement at St. Pete and, in a wider sense, for all of 2020. After two attempted reboots from the team owned by Sam Schmidt and Ric Peterson, the rebirth as Arrow McLaren SP was a pre-season curiosity with few expectations for significant results. On the back of four podiums, he took fourth in the championship and closed the year with a second at St. Pete, chasing down Newgarden and holding off Dixon. And he looked completely at home in that Newgarden-O’Ward-Dixon finishing order. Lost among the title celebrations and sorrow for those he shared the podium with, a preview of 2021 was delivered by the high-energy Indy Lights champion.

More than 100,000 registered voters petitioned to put Initiative 65 on the ballot. The alternative was put there by legislators. Sponsors of the original initiative say the alternative is intended to cause confusion and kill the original.
 There’s a two-step process for voting on 65 and 65A. The ballot first instructs people to “Vote for approval of either, or against both.” It then says, “And vote for one” — either 65 or 65A.
 Watson has said that even if people vote against both initiatives on the first part, they can still vote for one of the proposals on the second part.
 The Mississippi Municipal League opposes Initiative 65, partially because the initiative limits zoning rules that local governments may put on medical marijuana centers.

Have you ever lied awake at night and wondered, 'what if a dozen heavily-armed Gorillas entered the Thunderdome?'
 No? Oh, uh, yeah. Me either. But _if_ _you have_ , we've found the footage to quell that mental anguish. Witness the King of the Baggers race, held last weekend at Laguna Seca. The showcase pits 800-plus pound cruiser motorcycles (called "baggers" because you can sling a pair of bags on the side of the bike and send the thing like an uncorked bottle rocket across this fair country) against the fairest track west of the Mississippi. The bikes represent many of the major motorcycle manufacturers with skin in the cruiser game -- your Harleys, Indians, and Yamahas. That means this is legitimate showroom stock racing, conducted at one of racings most-sacred temples.
 While this one-off showcase race came attached to MotoAmerica's Superbike Speedfest at Monterey, you have to appreciate the sheer spectacle of it all. Some of America's top Superbike riders mounted these hogs for the showdown, and it shows. Watch the YouTube video in 1080p. Look at the bikes' rear tires squirming and squiggling as the riders eke out every last degree of throttle input before arcing under the bridge along Laguna's front straight. Check out those knees dragging as the bikes compress under the strain of Laguna's many- stories-tall Corkscrew corner.
 As with most modern motorcycle racing, this video offers a breath of fresh air; the racing is close and often hair-raising, unspoiled by the complex aero that's turned modern F1 (among many other series) into bland processionals. __
 We hope MotoAmerica latches on to this series, so we can catch these 800-lb. gorillas doing battle at tracks across America.

Nvidia has had Color Filters as part of Nvidia Freestyle for over 2 years, in all that time AMD still hasn't done anything to address this critical missing feature in their software suite. I'm a lifelong ATI/AMD fanboy but I CANNOT play games like Call of Duty 2019, Tarkov and Warzone without the Nvidia color filters, it's just too difficult to see people without them! The difference the Nvidia color filters make in competitive games is borderline cheating, they make everything easier to see, have less blur, improve contrast on player models, and completely remove shadows to make spotting players in dark areas a non-issue. If Warzone isn't your thing, look at games like Escape from Tarkov, the Nvidia color filters make a dark dingy hallway clearly visible while AMD users are stuck in the dark! Every single COD streamer and youtuber has videos on setting up Nvidia color filters for a competitive advantage and with the latest night-time mode that has been added to Warzone that filter is more important than ever. What the f' is AMD doing about this? What is so difficult about making a color filter software and chucking it into their driver suite!?!

Male enhancement pills are as old as the supplement industry itself. Although historians understandably haven’t dedicated much time to researching the historical origins of actual enlargement, our guess is that men have been trying to increase the size of their manhood member for hundreds of years or more. Unfortunately for these men, few natural male enhancement treatments for size enlargement have been medically proven to work. Most are fully aware that shaft enlargement surgery can be effective, but only medically recommended in the case of a micropenis. And it should go without saying that surgery also comes with multiple serious side effects, and likely only to be in case of dire need.

The Carolina Panthers will host the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday night. It's the only game on Carolina's schedule slated for a national prime-time audience -- Matt Rhule's Panthers will be under the lights for the first time.
 Carolina is 3-8 all-time on Thursdays, including last year's Week 2 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that ended up being quarterback Cam Newton's last game as a Panther.
 For the short week, Rhule is taking the same approach with his practice schedule that former New York Giants head coach Tom Coughlin did in 2012 when Rhule was his assistant offensive line coach. That year, the Giants beat the Panthers on "Thursday Night Football," 36-7.
 "I'm using our exact Thursday night game schedule from when I was at the Giants, when we actually came down and played the Panthers on a Thursday night here in Bank of America Stadium," Rhule said. "I liked the schedule. I remember leaving that game saying, 'This was probably our best game that year.' So, I just kind of took that same approach."
 This Thursday night game happens to fall just before the halfway point in the Panthers' season with a chance to go to .500 at 4-4 with a win and then get a couple extra days to prepare to visit the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 9.

If all goes well, league play in Saskatchewan will start next month.
 A few parents, McClintock said, withheld their children because they objected to mask mandates in arenas. “The clear majority — I would say over 90% of our associations did not expect any drop in registrations at all,” McClintock said. “For the most part, people just want their kids to play, and they understand the big picture.”
 The Greater Toronto Hockey League, for players ages 6 to 19, had a meticulous plan to be ready to play this month. With some 2,800 teams and 40,000 players, officials and volunteers under its umbrella, the league is the largest minor hockey association in the world. But at an emergency board meeting on Oct. 3, the start of the season was postponed to January.
 “At the end of the day,” said Scott Oakman, the league’s executive director, “we made a decision based on public health concerns around operating hockey during a pandemic when the infection rates were rising rapidly in our jurisdiction.”
 None of the three regional loops that make up the Canadian Hockey League, hockey’s top junior tier, are playing this week. The Western Hockey League won’t begin its season until January.
 After months of planning, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League started its schedule in early October, slightly later than in the previous season. “It went well,” said Maxime Blouin, the league’s director of communications. But not for long: Two teams that played each other on the first weekend abruptly suspended operations after 34 players, staff members and officials tested positive for the virus.
 With infection rates rising across the province, the league’s 10 other Quebec- based teams soon followed suit. The league’s six teams in Canada’s not-so- hard-hit maritime provinces continued to play among themselves, in front of a limited number of fans, while the Quebecois government promised 12 million Canadian dollars in funding for the league’s teams in the province. Then the league announced late Tuesday that some games in Quebec would resume this weekend, more than two weeks after some teams had played their last game.
 The Ontario Hockey League is expected to begin its season in January or February. The league itself hasn’t been talking about the conditions under which its 17 Canadian teams and the three based in the United States will take the ice, but Lisa MacLeod, Ontario’s minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, has been clear that the government’s ban on combat and contact sports will not be relaxed to accommodate the OHL.
 “This is a precaution based on circumstance,” she said in an interview. “There is no physical contact allowed, regardless of what sport it is.”
 Any plan that the government approves will have to include amended rules that eliminate body checking and fighting.

It was Nov. 1, 1957, that the 3.5-mile HRBT opened to traffic, knitting the Peninsula and south Hampton Roads together. It was a marvel of its time: an elevated bridge over the water leading to a two-lane tunnel buried beneath the harbor floor.
 The bridge-tunnel replaced ferries as the mode of transport from one side of the water to the other, and it cost $1.25 to use (equivalent to $11.58 today). Planning and construction took years, nodding to the complicated task of ensuring a safe crossing for vehicle traffic while protecting water routes in and out for commercial, recreation and military traffic on the water.

Even in pre-pandemic times, all was not well with hockey in Canada. The realities of the high cost of playing the game, flagging enrollment and the relentless toll of concussions have all disrupted the sport. So have questions about how much the game’s traditional demographics and its slow-to-shift attitudes fail to reflect a multicultural, progressive society.
 Still, hockey is deeply and proudly embraced, and across the country the local rink remains a community hub. Working with Hockey Canada and public health authorities across the country, provincial associations have been at the forefront of the effort to get the sport running again.
 In Saskatchewan, progress was steady through September, according to Kelly McClintock, the general manager of the Saskatchewan Hockey Association, which counts some 35,000 players in its minor-league, junior and senior constituencies.
 Teams had tryouts, chose their players and started to practice. “In the larger centers you could create leagues of up to 50 people,” McClintock said, “and you could play games and scrimmage and there were no worries about using dressing rooms, or body contact. So it was fairly normal to start — it’s just that we weren’t allowed to play games.”
