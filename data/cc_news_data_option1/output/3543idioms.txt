On the first day my caddie told me to knock down a 6-iron from 100 yards. I was like, wait, what? I’ve never had to hit this shot before. As I kept getting more used to it, and how the wind would affect the shot, I feel like the second day I was more prepared and more aware of what I had to do. I was just thinking if only I could make the cut, I feel like I had a grasp of what I had to do. But unfortunately, I missed it by one.

Wouldn’t Davy Crockett wonder at the small beeping boxes that almost every hunter has in his pocket these days?
 But now we can access a lot of information we need over our phones and computers and the Game Commission has made a lot of it available to us that way.
 If you hunt State Game Lands, having a map is vital. The Pennsylvania Game Commission now offers a site where you can create customized maps; search, discover and print SGL maps with features including aerial photos, topographic base maps, Wildlife Management Units and more. Many is the day in my past that I would have given a lot to have that info at my fingertips.
 You can access the list of over 400 miles of roads that are open to hunters only during the season. This listing shows location maps, descriptions of sate game lands roads and their opening and closing dates.
 The calendar of hunting seasons is also available and there was a day many years ago when I would have benefited from having that info at my fingertips. It was fall turkey season — or so I really thought — so I went to some local game lands, hiked to my spot, put up my orange to mark my position, and proceeded to spend the next couple hours calling turkeys.
 After awhile, a nagging thought emerged from somewhere inside me: are you really sure the season is still on for this week or did it close last week? Once that thought presented itself, I just didn’t know. Yes, of all people I should have known and was without excuse for not knowing, but I was so sure that I did know but now I was doubting myself.
 I became so uncomfortable that I got up, gathered all my gear, and then had a lengthy hike back to my vehicle. I had to cross a large field right by the road where I was parked, and I just knew that the Game Commission was going to come along and pounce on me for hunting out of season. I didn’t even have the hunting digest with me in my truck so I had to drive home and when I did, I found out that season had indeed ended. I had been hunting illegally for several hours that morning.
 I could have saved myself a lot of grief had I then owned a phone on which I could access the information I needed.

Doves apparently set down on light lines to look over a feeding area before they put down in it. Be reminded not to shoot at birds on power lines. That could get you into big trouble. Of course, the more any particular covey of doves is shot at, the spookier they get.
 Dove breasts are easy to saute in butter or deep-fry if you like. Slow cooking is best because such small items will dry out if cooked too fast. Lawrys has a great marinade that is good for all poultry but especially for doves — teriyaki marinade with pineapple juice.
 Dove hunters wear camouflage clothes, take up posts near flyways — the most likely place where doves flying from one field to another would cross, then, like turkey hunters, sit as still as a statue. Doves are spooked royally by fidgeting hunters. Try to position yourself so that your shots will be at birds flying horizontally to you. Shots at these speedsters are difficult enough without trying to bag birds coming straight on.
 A portable seat is almost essential. Not the cushion you use for turkey hunting but a small stool with legs. The portable, pop-out canvas seats are perfect and lightweight. Some hunters tote along a bucket to sit on, but use whatever is most comfortable for you. Choose your set-up for doves with a good background that will help hide your silhouette. Trying to shoot at streaking birds while sitting on the ground is awkward at best. A seat gives you leverage for your feet, a great help when wing-shooting.
 Most dove hunters prefer a shotgun with modified choke and shot sized from No. 7-9. To have any chance at all, you need a shot pattern that spreads well. When action slows down in the flyways, a group of hunters often spreads out in a field and slowly tramps through, trying to jump the birds up, much like pheasant hunting. If you have all day to hunt, a combination of tactics probably will offer up the most chances for shots. When a dove drops, keep your eyes peeled on the drop site. Unless you have a retriever along, a dove dropped into grass can be mighty hard to locate.
 Remember that to hunt doves, you must have a Migratory Game Bird License. Daily limit for doves is 15 daily and having only 45 birds in possession at one time. Season hours must be memorized. Dove seasons are always split so consulting the PA Migratory Game Bird Hunting brochure at the Post Office where you purchase your Federal Duck Stamp is a must.

AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Maine’s seafood industry could get a $20 million boost this fall through funds made available under the federal CARES Act. Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher said state and federal officials are nearing final agreement on exactly how to allocate the funds. Maine Public reports that individual fishing license holders and shellfish growers who qualify will get the same lump-sum payment, no matter how large or small the operation. The funds will go to seafood-sector businesses that lost at least 35% of their revenues compared with the same period in previous years. A document DMR produced for the federal government shows that commercial fishing license holders, boat-for-hire operations and aquaculture farms that qualify could get more than $2,100 each, while seafood dealers and processors are projected to receive just over $6,000 each. Kelliher emphasized that the exact value of the lump-sum benefits will depend on exactly how many businesses qualify for the funds. “The need is likely there for even more relief in the long run,” Keliher said. The state could go back to Congress to seek more aid, he said. For now the goal is to get the checks struck by the end of October. “But we need to get this out on the ground and then figure out what the picture is like as we approach the end of the year and then see if we need to go back to congress and ask for more.”

Slumping New York Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez was benched in favor of Erik Kratz to start Sunday's series finale against the Orioles in Baltimore.
 Sanchez, 27, has struck out seven straight times -- including in all four plate at-bats during Saturday's 6-1 setback. He is mired in a 4-for-35 slump.
 "I kind of deliberated on it a lot last night and just feel this is the way I need to go right now," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Sunday morning. "Hopefully a day off or two or however I decide to do it here can help get him going."
 Sanchez is batting .130 with seven homers and 15 RBIs to go along with 48 strikeouts in 100 at-bats this season.
 By comparison, Sanchez had 34 homers and 77 RBIs in 106 games while batting .232 in 2019.
 "Gary wants to play, and to his credit, behind the scenes he's working his tail off," Boone said. "He wants to be in there, but in the end, I think this is the best thing right now."
