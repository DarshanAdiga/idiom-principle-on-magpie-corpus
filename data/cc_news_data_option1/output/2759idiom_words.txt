His treatment still continues though he can now walk on crutches. “Not much changed for me. I had two legs, and now I have four,” he jokes. But he can’t walk long due to pain and says he now has “a short-distance life.” A driver at the local health directorate before the coup attempt, Parlak was left without a job but was later employed by the Ministry of Family, Labor and Social Services to work a desk job. “I worked in jobs requiring physical skills until 50, and at this age, it is difficult for me to work a desk job. But you learn something new when you grow older,” he says. Parlak downplays what he did during the coup attempt. “We are not that important. What was important was to stop those people who tried to destroy our state. They forgot our motto: Every Turk is a born soldier. It doesn’t matter whether you wear a uniform or not. We are always ready to give our lives for our homeland, for our nation. Whenever they want to try their hand in another coup, we will be ready to confront them. I don’t mind if I die,” he says.

Parlak found out about the coup attempt when then-Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım announced there was “an attempt” against the government on TV. “As a matter of fact, I didn’t know what he meant, but I sensed a coup was underway,” he told Anadolu Agency (AA). Parlak was an 11-year-old boy when Turkey was rocked by prior coup on Sept. 12, 1980. “I knew what the coup was, but it usually happens late at night and I thought there wouldn’t be a new coup. Then, I saw our president speaking about a coup attempt on TV and heard a sala being recited from the mosque behind my house,” he said. On the night of the coup attempt, muezzins all across the country took to the mosques to recite this call to prayer which is originally used to announce the death of a Muslim. Accompanied with a message to stand against putschists, salas echoed on July 15, 2016, across Turkey. “I felt a fever and was excited. I told my wife I was going out and grabbed a Turkish flag. I did not know where to go, but I had to do something,” Parlak says. When he heard a noise from a nearby police station, he ran in that direction and saw a crowd surrounding it, to protect the police inside from putschists. “Everyone was parking their cars as a barricade around the police station,” Parlak recounted. Then, some people started to disperse, either heading to the airport to welcome President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who arrived from southern Turkey or to a bridge occupied by putschists. Parlak joined those heading to the bridge, but on the road, someone in the crowd said there was “trouble” near the TRT building in the Harbiye district. The crowd headed there but was stopped by an armored police truck. “A policeman told us something bad would happen to us if we advanced, but we insisted and told him to clear the road. He let us go,” said Parlak, who was among the crowd of 50 people. He was in the front row of the crowd when putschists occupying the TRT building started firing upon them. “I was hit by five bullets, and the impact hurled me some four meters away. I was trying to stand up when shrapnel hit me again,” he recalled. He was half- conscious, lying on the ground for about 45 minutes. “Ambulances were coming to get us, but putschists fired on them too. A policeman dragged me to an alley to protect me from gunfire. Some people tried to put me in a van which would leave for a hospital. But it was full of injured, and there was no room. The same policeman stopped a car passing by and took me to the hospital. It did not end there. I had to wait for 18 hours for surgery because the hospital was flooded with the injured and the dead,” he said.

Emotions run high as Yaşar Parlak reads the names of those who died or were wounded while liberating the building of public broadcaster TRT from putschists four years ago. Leaning on crutches, Parlak remembers the night of July 15, 2016, when he joined hundreds of others in Istanbul to stop putschists linked to the Gülenist Terror Group (FETÖ). Bullets struck his two feet and slowed him down, but in the end, civilians like him played a key role in forcing putschist soldiers to surrender.

Yılmaz Lale, a retired noncommissioned officer, is still proud of the “public defense” against the putschists. The 52-year-old was injured when putschists opened fire on a crowd of civilians confronting them near the Office of the Chief of General Staff, the Turkish army’s headquarters in the capital Ankara, on July 15, 2016. Lale worked hard to dissuade the putschists and their subordinates, some of whom were forced to join the coup by their superiors that night. He first went to Kızılay Square of the capital upon learning that the coup was unfolding and saw an armored personnel carrier there. “I climbed up the vehicle and told soldiers to surrender. They answered that their superiors would be angry. I told them they would be held accountable for what they did, but they started firing. I remember carrying at least 10 injured people to the ambulances,” Lale told AA. He and others laid down on the street as tanks were rolling to stop them, but soldiers in tanks fired on them. “The noise was immense when the bullets hit the asphalt. I felt my body shaking as bullets hit near us. They were firing not to kill but to warn us, to disperse us. When they stopped firing, I saw a female soldier lying down and tried to drag her to safety. Then, a friend accompanying me told me I was bleeding. I hadn’t noticed until then and saw blood all over my trousers when I touched my leg,” he recounted. After surgery, Lale was back to his past life. Today, he says he feels honored to be a “gazi” or veteran. “God gave me this honor, and I am proud. It has been four years, but I still relive that day. It was something we did to defend our homeland. Without your homeland, you have no family, no future. Every soldier dreams of taking a bullet for his homeland, and I accomplished it,” he proudly says.
