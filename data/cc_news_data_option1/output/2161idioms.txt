Thomas Del Beccaro is the former Chairman of the Republican Party in California and told Nick that the President was right to use force to allow him to walk to a local church for a photo call.
 To do so, police used tear gas to remove protesters from outside the White House.
 And Mr Del Beccaro insisted that law and order is needed to deal with some of the protests. He said: "The President has been tough on this for sure. There are times when he's been pretty rough and tumble on this and I wish everyone, including the President, would speak in a more calming voice about this.
 "But at the end of the day, law and order is needed.
 "Things are out of control in some areas.
 "In America, those symbols are important and it's important that a President is seen doing things instead of being afraid.
 "The fact he took that walk and showed America that things can be controlled and law and order is possible was an important symbol - and in many jurisdictions, they're not trying to do that."

The global pandemic that has brought state economies to their knees may wind up being more than just a trim off the top. If the hope was for something akin to Gov. Charlie Baker's once-a-year charity buzz cut, the reality might look more like a shave with a rusty Bic razor.


  The governor did, as it turns out, get his hair cut early last Tuesday morning as barbershops and salons were among the businesses to get the go- ahead from the state this week to resume operations. He and his barber wore masks, his temperature was checked at the door, and Plexiglas separated his chair from other cutting stations.


  Offices everywhere but Boston were also allowed to reopen under limited capacities, as were retail stores for curbside pickup and car washes and pet groomers. But it's going to take more than just a few new hair-dos to stabilize the state's fiscal slide.


  As Congress bickers over the size and scope of the next federal relief package, the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation warned this week that the pillars of the state's economy - health care, higher education, tourism - could be so fundamentally shaken that a sharp "V" shaped recovery is no longer possible.


  A vaccine or viable treatment for COVID-19 remains the Holy Grail to resuming normal activities, and without it the fiscal watchdog group predicted that state tax revenue may not fully rebound until fiscal 2025.


  What that means for next year, however, is still anyone's guess. Much remains unknown about how lawmakers will approach budgeting for the fiscal year that begins July 1, and how much money will be available to spend. MTF and others have predicted that as much as $6 billion in anticipated revenues could disappear. But that's just a guess, and Congress could fill some of that hole.


  More than 90 economists and the influential Raise Up Massachusetts coalition of community, faith and labor organizations implored Beacon Hill last week to consider tax increases - namely on businesses - before resorting to deep budget cuts that could erode important safety nets for struggling families.


  But a vaccine or treatment is critical to more than just economic vibrancy. It's necessary, under Gov. Baker's reopening strategy, to unlock Phase 4 - "New Normal."


  Without it, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and the Boston Athletic Association determined that it was just too risky to try to run the iconic Boston marathon in September.


  Officials had postponed the 123-year-old road race from April 20 to Sept. 14 with the hope that a large gathering of athletes and spectators from around the world might be safe by late summer. That is no longer the case. And so for the first time since 1897, there will be no official 26.2-mile road race. No special state holiday to celebrate that feat of athleticism. And no excuse to play morning baseball.


  Walsh is proceeding much slower than what it would take to pull off any of that. For now, finding ways to clear sidewalk and street space for outdoor dining feels more achievable.


  Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said Friday that restaurants would be allowed to reopen to diners for outdoor service at the start of Phase 2, which won't begin until June 8 at the earliest. Indoor dining will follow in Phase 2, but just not at the start, and parties will be limited to 6, with no seating at the bar.


  The governor said he will make the call on whether to proceed to the next phase of reopening on Saturday, June 6, depending on the health metrics that for much of this week showed encouraging, if slow, progress.


  The other part of reopening that doesn't get as much attention is that even as businesses start to reawaken, consumers may not be in the right headspace to go back to life as they knew it. A MassINC Polling Center survey released last week found that 44 percent of people were likely to take fewer trips outside their home than before the pandemic, and 28 percent said those trips were more likely to be alone in their car.


  In fact, 67 percent said they weren't fully comfortable with the idea of returning to public transportation, underscoring the challenge facing public officials of not just restoring services like the MBTA, but restoring confidence in their safety.


  MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak said that part of his agency's strategy will be to implement new "crowding thresholds" on buses and trains to enable mask-wearing passengers to also keep socially distant. Once that threshold is reached, Poftak said the T is looking at ways to bring on additional service, or to offer alternate but overlapping modes of transit, to help people safely get where they're going.


  Convincing people to return to public transit is not the only sales pitch officials will be making this summer.


  Education Commissioner Jeff Riley said that while it will ultimately be the governor's call, it's his intention to have K-12 schools "up and running" in the fall when classes would normally resume. This school year, obviously, got cut short, and Riley said the plan is also for high school sophomores that were supposed to take English and math MCAS exams this spring to instead get the test this winter.


  As challenging, perhaps, as one of those MCAS questions, the state budget has understandably flummoxed legislators who can feel the fiscal ground shifting underneath them on a daily basis, but another matter that has vexed leaders for weeks got done.


  The House and Senate finally came together to send Gov. Baker a bill that would require substantially more reporting on the impact of COVID-19 and testing efforts.


  But there's no doubt the bill would have packed more punch if the branches didn't spend over a month passing it back and forth and arguing over who cares more about seniors. It took a "still, still, still further amendment" from the Senate to get the details just right, which is legislative parlance for too many changes.


  In the intervening time, the administration's Command Center significantly ramped up its reporting efforts on the reach of COVID-19, especially at long- term care facilities. The state began publishing what will be new daily and weekly updates on testing at nursing homes, deaths by long-term care facility, city and town testing totals and positive test rates by municipality, among other metrics.


  So will Baker sign it? He answered that question with a question Friday. "Can I read it first?" he asked.


  The Legislature's bill does cover the state-run soldiers' homes in Chelsea and in Holyoke, where the governor was reluctant last week to say much, other than to defer to the special investigation he commissioned into the outbreak at the Holyoke hospital for veterans.


  Baker maintains that he and Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders didn't find out about the outbreak in Holyoke until one Sunday night in March when it was too late to contain. By morning Superintendent Bennett Walsh had been removed, and Baker hired an outside lawyer to probe what had happened.


  But Walsh's lawyer this week released emails, according to reports, that he and Walsh say prove that the superintendent had kept Veterans' Affairs Secretary Francisco Urena and Medicaid Director Dan Tsai apprised of what was happening with COVID-19 infections at the home throughout the outbreak.


  Holyoke isn't the only long-term care facility in the crosshairs of investigators.


  Attorney General Maura Healey said this week her office would be investigating Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley, where U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan said more than 20 residents and health care workers have died and dozens have tested positive.

Millions of people are sharing posts and information on social media about the protests all across the country. Some of it is true, some of it is not. Some of what‚Äôs being posted and shared aren‚Äôt from real people at all.


  Dr. Gideon Blocq is the CEO of a company called Vinesight, that searches through all the social media posts being shared around the world, trying to spot false information and how it is spread. He says he's never seen anything like the amount of toxic posts being shared now, with no basis in fact.


  "Over the weekend, we saw a spike 3-and-a-half times more misinformation and toxic attacks compared to corona,‚Äù he explained.


  That's saying quite a lot, as false information about COVID-19 swept across social media a couple of months ago.


  Much of it, Blocq says, is created and shared faster than the platforms can react.


  "What we're seeing is that there's a lot of automation appearing,‚Äù said Blocq. ‚ÄúA lot of so-called bots and automation that can turn one voice into hundreds of thousands of voices and amplify it so much to go trending on social media."


  On Monday, the hashtag #dcblackout went viral on Twitter following a tweet that described horrifying moments in downtown DC. It claimed there was a blackout of all communication through cellphones so that no one protesting could tell followers what was happening. The original tweets included photos and videos. Twitter was besieged by these tweets which, according to the Washington Post, was first tweeted out by an account with just 3 followers. The hashtag went viral with photos and videos and supposed "first-hand accounts." One photo shared thousands of times, was actually a photo taken from the TV show "Designated Survivor."


  "That was a very sophisticated misinformation attack,‚Äù explains Blocq. ‚ÄúNone of that was true. Our systems picked it up but it's really unlike the stuff we usually see."


  Dr. Blocq says because of how all sides use social media to push their agenda, users should not believe everything they see.


  "If it's a trusted news source, that gives some credibility. If three trusted news sources spoke about it, that gives a lot more credibility," he said.


  Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts following Monday‚Äôs incident. DC police Chief Peter Newsham responded to media questions that there was no communication blackout of any sort. Verizon and AT&T also confirmed there was no interruption of service to customers.


  News travels fast in today‚Äôs social media driven world. False news can spread even faster. Always try to verify a post or video before sharing it to your followers and friends.

In fact, there are valid reasons why the Moon is NASA‚Äôs next big target. The science community is jonesing for a more in-depth study of the Moon. We have far more-advanced technology now, compared to NASA‚Äôs Apollo program and that first Moon walk in 1969. There still are a lot of unknowns about our nearest space destination.
 It is likely the commercial entry into space exploration will be the key to eventual success. Sustainable lunar exploration will need more than NASA has to offer. And the private sector recognizes some, perhaps a lot of profit potential.
 Just in general, private companies are far more agile in research and development than government agencies, and plans for an orbiting lunar outpost are already in the works, which could facilitate colonization at some time in the future. The way things are going here on Earth, we may need a space colony.

Dear Dave,   Is it okay to combine finances with someone and start working on a budget before you marry them? I just got engaged, and we've been talking about the idea of getting a head start on our finances together.   Autumn
 Dear Autumn,   First, congratulations! I hope you two will have long and happy lives together. Now comes the hard part. But you asked for my opinion, so here goes.   No, it's not a good idea to combine finances with anyone you're not married to. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you two are thinking about your finances and your future - and I'd never wish anything bad for you - but all kinds of things can happen before you become husband and wife. What if you spend time paying off his debt, or vice versa, then the relationship doesn't work out?   However, this doesn't mean you can't begin working together on budgets for the future, and planning and dreaming about the goals you have together. The thing to keep in mind is you'll both need to be operating in full transparency mode to make it happen. He should know all about your income and debts, and you should know all about his. Along the way, you two need to have serious, regular discussions about saving, spending and debt to ensure you're completely on the same page with your finances before the big day.   There you go. My advice is both of you should pay only your own bills until after you're married. And remember, once that happens there's no yours and his anymore - it all becomes ours.   Dave
 Self-insure long-term care needs?
 Dear Dave,   I've been researching long-term care policies. Can you reach a point financially where you can self-insure long-term care needs, and not buy a long-term care insurance policy?   Paul
 Dear Paul,   It's possible, mathematically speaking, if you have the resources available to pay for the care you'd receive in a nursing home or similar facility for about 20 years. Not many folks have that kind of money, though. I think it's a large enough bill that it makes sense to transfer the risk to a long-term care insurance policy.   Keep in mind, too, if you're married you have to think about your spouse, and make sure they have enough to live on comfortably at the same time. That's a lot of money. And that's why I advise virtually everyone to put good, long- term care coverage in place at age 59 or 60. It can mean the difference between living with dignity, or having to depend on the government!   Dave

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Steve Linick irritated powerful Democrats and Republicans alike in his seven years as the independent watchdog investigating waste and mismanagement at the State Department. Still, he was stunned by a Friday night phone call saying President Donald Trump had fired him.Linick's access to the computer system, and to the building, was cut off. He asked for a reason, and none was given. He could only surmise his dismissal as inspector general was tied to him investigating Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a person familiar with his account, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.Linick‚Äôs dismissal was part of a wave of firings or demotions by Trump that, even for a president with a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired‚Äù catchphrase, has been notably brazen for their appearance of retribution and vindictiveness. Trump's moves, coming with Washington consumed by the coronavirus, have upended the longstanding, bipartisan support for officials tasked with ensuring the integrity of government agencies ‚Äî and roiled a watchdog community whose work presidents may not always like but learn to tolerate.‚ÄúThere's a tension between what his instincts are, which is to brook no criticism whatsoever, and what the inspector general's job is as defined by statute, which is to do independent audits and investigations," said former Justice Department inspector general Michael Bromwich.Trump's actions, done with minimal explanation, have triggered congressional demands for answers, with House investigators scheduled to interview Linick on Wednesday. He plans to tell them that he has ‚Äúserved without regard to politics‚Äù in his nearly three-decade career in public service and has always been committed to independent oversight, according to opening remarks obtained by The Associated Press.Trump has made clear at least some of the moves were personal.He said he fired the intelligence community watchdog, Michael Atkinson, in April because he had alerted Congress to the whistleblower report on Ukraine that Democrats used for his impeachment. He raged that Atkinson was insufficiently loyal and part of the ‚ÄúDeep State‚Äù that has opposed his presidency from the beginning, according to three current or former administration officials. Trump had wanted to fire Atkinson weeks earlier, only to be talked out of it by his advisers, they said.After he fired Linick last month, he labeled him an Obama appointee and said he'd acted on the encouragement of Pompeo, who denied it was retaliation but said he wished he'd recommended it sooner.In between, Trump selected a replacement for Christi Grimm of Health and Human Services after she issued a report that the president openly scorned. He demoted Glenn Fine as acting Defense Department watchdog, stripping him of oversight of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief effort. Democrats have raised questions about whether a Transportation Department acting inspector general who was removed was replaced for political reasons, too.All presidents take umbrage at inspector general oversight, a post-Watergate concept meant to root out waste, fraud and corruption. Armed with teams of investigators and broad powers, the more than 70 inspectors general are often a thorn for their agencies, documenting profligate spending, mismanagement and other concerns ‚Äî CIA interrogation of terror suspects, for instance ‚Äî that can make front-page news.President Ronald Reagan fired incumbent inspectors general after taking office, though he reappointed some. President Barack Obama dismissed one early in his tenure with minimal explanation.‚ÄúTrump has been more transparent in his opposition, and he‚Äôs been more willing to take very aggressive actions, but this is an institution created by Congress and protected by Congress ‚Äî and presidents just don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù said New York University public service professor Paul Light.Chuck McCullough, the intelligence community inspector general under Obama, said he maintained a sparsely decorated office, aware he could be fired any time. McCullough and Linick were instrumental in raising concerns former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have mishandled classified information on a private email server. McCullough said he was told during the 2016 election by a Clinton associate that, in a Clinton presidency, he and Linick would be the ‚Äúfirst to be fired."Congressional Democrats say Linick was fired while investigating how the State Department pushed through a $7 billion Saudi arms sale over congressional objections. He was also reviewing how Pompeo treated certain staff.Pompeo has said he knew about the Saudi investigation because he had answered written questions about it. But he denied Linick's dismissal was retaliatory, suggesting instead Linick wasn't on board with the department's mission.In other administrations, investigating a Cabinet secretary might be insurance against being fired because the optics of doing so would be damaging. Not so for Trump.‚ÄúWith Trump, it just kind of lays bare all the old sort of bluffing about how IGs are protected,‚Äù McCullough said. ‚ÄúIt was all based upon a perception that an administration wouldn't do this because, optically, it would appear as though it was retaliation and retribution. When your concern for optics are out the window, the bluff is kind of revealed.‚ÄùSome inspector general reports have worked in Trump's favor, including Justice Department investigations that uncovered anti-Trump text messages by FBI employees and revealed problems with the FBI's conduct during the Russia probe.But Trump has appeared flummoxed by the inability to control watchdogs, as evidenced by his anger at Atkinson over the whistleblower complaint that documented his efforts to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on Democratic rival Joe Biden.Though presidents' ability to fire inspectors general is well-established, Congress is raising questions about the dubious qualifications of some of the replacements and, in some cases, their apparent conflicts.Trump, for instance, has selected a policy adviser at Customs and Border Protection to replace the deeply experienced Fine, who had been acting inspector general at the Pentagon for four years and Justice Department watchdog for a decade before that.Senior officials at the State and Transportation departments are functioning as acting inspectors general at their agencies, effectively holding two jobs at once and setting up a conflict that good-government advocates and some in Congress say is untenable.McCullough, now a partner at the Compass Rose Legal Group, said he doubted Trump's moves would stymie investigations by career employees, but said the climate nonetheless complicates recruitment of "the best and the brightest.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd if you do recruit people under this sort of climate," he asked, "are their findings going to be as aggressive and hard-hitting and as factual as everyone expects?‚ÄùCopyright 2020 Associated Press.

History was made of sorts, but not in a good way, when the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) announced last week that the 2020 running of the Boston Marathon will not take place, because of the coronavirus scare.      The Patriots' Day tradition was originally postponed until Sept. 14, but the governing body was forced to cancel it altogether for the first time in the 124-year history of the venerable event in light of the ongoing pandemic.      The news did not really surprise the running community. But then again, how could this happen, and where do we go from here?      While it was still incredibly disappointing to everyone involved, the prospect of more than 31,000 runners from every corner of the world descending upon the small town of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, in the midst of a pandemic - that is likely to spike again in the fall - made the decision to cancel the only correct decision.      The implications of this decision are profound. The running of the marathon on Patriots' Day has always been an opportunity for the City of Boston to showcase its many cultural and historical gems, while also injecting more than $200 million into the local economy.      Many run for charities, with more than $38 million raised last year for worthy causes alone. And then, there is the legendary history from the previous 123 years.      It all started in 1897, and was inspired by the first Olympic Marathon held in Athens, Greece. Throughout the next 122 years, it became the oldest continuous marathon. The format, ironically, was changed in 1918, when the Spanish Flu affected the world, not to mention it was also the beginning of WWI. The traditional race was replaced with a military relay in honor of our troops.      Last week's unprecedented decision by the BAA also included that the race will be held virtually. Each participant is invited to run the marathon distance on or after Sept. 14. Registration fees will be refunded, and the prized marathon medals will be mailed to the finishers. Additionally, the BAA will be announcing a full-week of events celebrating the marathon's uniqueness.      Because 2021 was scheduled to be a significant milestone in the race's 125-year history, the decision to find some way to hold the 124th was critical. But for those that were expecting to run the 124th in the traditional format, the disappointment is still profound.      There is a small, but exclusive group of runners who are members of the QCC, the Quarter Century Club. To become a member, you must officially complete 25 consecutive Boston Marathons. I am now a retired member with 35 consecutive finishes, so I can attest that these folks are struggling with the implications of now having to run the race solo to keep the streak alive.      Not everybody, of course. In fact, each year more than 50% of the runners are first-timers.      I have many close friends, who would be experiencing the thrill of running Boston for the first time this year. Take, for example, Amanda. When she learned that she would be given the opportunity to run the 124th, she literally fell to her knees in tears of joy. "This has been a dream, and now it will be a reality," she said.      However, she won't be experiencing those anxious hours driving to Hopkinton on the bus with her running counterparts, the excitement of being called to line up in Hopkinton's start corral and her heart racing at the sound of the starter's gun. She will also not experience the unbridled joy of running through the "scream tunnel" of the Wellesley College coeds, and then proudly conquering the Newton Hills, so well known as "Heartbreak Hill." And, of course, she will not feel the overwhelming emotions when runners turn the corner onto Hereford Street and see the finish line just a quarter-mile away.      This pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives, and likely many will be permanent changes. What will the future hold for the Boston Marathon? What will the future hold for the many other huge running events throughout the world? Will there be a time when 30, 40, 50,000 or more runners can gather at a starting line again?      In the meantime, runners will adapt as the running industry adapts.   Not only has the Boston Marathon been forced to deal with these new crowd restrictions, but every race - from local to international - that is scheduled to be run in 2020 is either cancelling, postponing or going virtual.   In fact, a plethora of new virtual running events has emerged, with goals ranging from simply running a 5K to virtually running the distance of the New York subway system, and runners love it. Social media posts show off the earned swag, most notably the medals. Give a runner a goal and the promise of a medal to commemorate the effort, and you have an event.      Guessing where we will be a year from now or beyond is an exercise in futility, but in my humble opinion the running world will be different. I hope traditional running events will be back, but will there be a drop in the enthusiasm?      I suspect we will have the Boston Marathon back in its traditional format. It is, of course, the most prestigious race for a runner. But I think many races will be hybrids. Runners will be given a choice of running virtually or onsite. But one thing is certain, race directors may have to reinvent their industry. It's a good thing that we have guys like Dave McGillivray, the Boston Marathon race director, who are figuring it out right now.      In the meantime, let's get out there for a run together alone.   Tom Licciardello is a founding member of the Merrimack Valley Striders. Licciardello has participated in 35 Boston's and 88 marathons altogether, and is a BAA Boston Marathon volunteer.

SPRINGFIELD -- A conference call between U.S. governors and Republican President Donald Trump led to the latest in a series of spats between Illinois' governor and the president Monday.


   


  "You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time. They're going to run over you. You're going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate," Trump told the governors, according to CBS news, which obtained audio recordings of the call.


   


  Trump reportedly admonished the governors for what he deemed a weak response to protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Minneapolis man who died Monday, May 25, after being pinned to the ground for nearly nine minutes with a white police officer's knee on his neck.


   


  The president called violent and destructive protestors "terrorists," according to audio of the phone call shared by the New York Times. He said the governors must arrest and charge those protestors with crimes and give them punishments lasting years.


   


  "They're anarchists, whether you like it or not," Trump said in the call, according to the Times audio. "I know some of you guys have a different persuasion and that's OK, I totally understand. I understand. I'm for everybody. I'm representing everybody. I'm not representing radical right, radical left. I'm representing everybody. But you have to know what you're dealing with, and it's happened before. It's happened numerous times. And the only time it's successful is when you're weak."


   


  Last week, Trump posted to Facebook and Twitter that "when the looting starts, the shooting starts." He has not formally addressed the nation since Floyd was killed or since widespread protesting began.


   


  "Someone throwing a rock is like shooting a gun," Trump told the governors in the Monday phone call. "You have to do retribution."


   


  Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told the president he took issue with his tone and lack of unifying response.


   


  "I wanted to take this moment -- and I can't let it pass -- to speak up and say that I've been extraordinarily concerned about the rhetoric that's been used by you," Pritzker said, according to a transcript. "It's been inflammatory, and it's not okay for that officer to choke George Floyd to death. But we have to call for calm. We have to have police reform called for. We've called out our national guard and our state police, but the rhetoric that's coming out of the White House is making it worse. And I need to say that people are feeling real pain out there and we've got to have national leadership in calling for calm and making sure that we're addressing the concerns of the legitimate peaceful protestors. That will help us to bring order."


   


  Pritzker, as recently as last week, called Trump a "xenophobe" and a "racist" in a public news conference. Since he ran for governor in 2018, Pritzker has frequently criticized the president, and the pair has sparred about the federal government's novel coronavirus response.


   


  "Okay well thank you very much JB," Trump said in response to the governor. "I don't like your rhetoric much either because I watched it with respect to the coronavirus, and I don't like your rhetoric much either. I think you could've done a much better job, frankly. But that's okay. And you know, we don't agree with each other."


   


  With protests continuing in several Illinois cities Monday, Pritzker hosted a media availability from the James R. Thompson Center in Chicago and addressed the matter upon questioning.


   


  "The truth is that the President has fanned the flames instead of bringing peace and calm," he said. "It is usually the job of the president to stand up in these circumstances, and try to bring down the temperature, that's not what this president does."


   


  He said after about 40 minutes on the call with Trump using what Pritzker deemed to be "inflammatory rhetoric," he spoke out.


   


  "I wish that the President would hold his words," Pritzker said. "I wish he would, if he can't say something that is going to help us across the nation to bring the temperature down, then he shouldn't say anything at all."

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) ‚Äî The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission plans to conduct an emergency investigation into the financial condition of an ocean shipping company seeking $25 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to remain in business. The commission said it will investigate Young Brothers LLC's ‚Äúfinancial condition, contingency plans, and access to financing,‚Äù West Hawaii Today reported Tuesday. The emergency investigation was prompted by state Consumer Advocacy Executive Director Dean Nishina, who said the pandemic has likely disrupted the effectiveness of previous projections for the company‚Äôs expenses and cargo volumes. Young Brothers President Jay Ana said the company, which employs 370 people statewide, needs the $25 million to maintain operations through December. Without the federal funding allocated by the state, Young Brothers would need to make cuts and maintain a schedule that reduces weekly trips between Honolulu and Hilo from two to one, Ana said. Young Brothers has filed a contingency plan and financial information requested by Nishina. ‚ÄúDeveloping this contingency plan for Young Brothers involved some incredibly difficult decisions,‚Äù Ana said in a statement. \"Ultimately, the people of Hawaii should know that our top priority is finding real solutions to ensure uninterrupted service to all of the communities we serve.\" The commission's emergency investigation order outlines the company‚Äôs May 26 request for coronavirus funds and recent financial history, including three applications for rate hikes over the past four years.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, health officials encourage good hand hygiene, social distance, and routine cleaning and disinfecting. Considering data about how the highly contagious virus spreads, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends wearing a cloth face covering in public settings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 Dr. Chad Weston, MD, who practices family medicine at Novant Health Oceanside Family Medicine and Convenient Care in Shallotte, said while wearing masks -- including cloth masks -- can be uncomfortable and inconvenient, "knowing that everyone wearing a mask is demonstrating caring for their neighbor and community is the bigger benefit."
   
 1) Wearing a mask or a cloth face covering is about protecting others
   
 "Masking among everybody reduces the chance of spread," Weston said. "It isn't so much about protecting yourself as it is about protecting your communities, and it really is about being a part of something bigger than yourself. I'll see some folks that seem to think they are tough guys, but that may not always be the case. I don't think this virus necessarily discriminates in that regard. Regardless of how healthy a person may seem to be or feel that they are, there's still a chance of contracting it."
   
 According to CDC, the COVID-19 virus has been detected in people who show no symptoms. Therefore, health experts say wearing a mask or cloth face covering whether one has symptoms or not helps prevent spread of the virus.
   
 While research is ongoing to learn more about how the virus is transmitted whether through airborne transmission, droplet transmission or both, Weston said, "We advise everyone to wear masks to help themselves and more importantly to protect each other."
   
 2) Wearing masks reminds people not to touch parts of their face
   
 Health officials recommend avoiding touching yout face to help protect against infection. But scratching and touching is something many do numerous times throughout the day, often without noticing.
   
 "I think another big thing about masking is that it helps remind you not to put your hands on your face or itch your eyes, mess with your nose or mouth," Weston said. "Those kinds of behaviors over numerous times during the day and numerous contacts with surfaces that may have the virus on them increases the possibility of someone contracting the virus."
   
 3) Washing hands frequently is more effective than wearing gloves
   
 Some people who wear masks are also wearing gloves to try to protect themselves. Weston said he worries this can have the opposite effect.
   
 "I really don't see the value of wearing gloves; if anything, I see it as more of a detriment because people are less likely to wash their hands while wearing gloves," he said. "And the thing is, within minutes they cross contaminate themselves by touching something with gloves. Rarely will people maintain a sterile field while wearing gloves; so, it kind of defeats the purpose. I'd rather them not wear gloves and wash their hands 10 times more frequently."
   
 4) Be careful taking masks on and off to help reduce the risk of infection
   
 Taking a mask on and off throughout the day without proper hand hygiene can pose issues.
   
 "The more you take it on and off the greater the probability of your hands contaminating the mask and your hand coming in contact with your face," Weston said.
   
 When it is time to remove one's mask, Weston said, one should wash your hands before taking the mask off, remove the mask, and then wash your hands again.
   
 Weston said if while driving around one wants to take your mask off between stops, utilize hand sanitizer when you can't wash your hands.
   
 "I see people driving down the road with mask on in their vehicle. I don't know if that's critical, but if while you're driving in your car, and you're able to do a simple (hand) hygiene technique like using hand sanitizer, and then remove your mask, and then use hand sanitizer again when you put the mask back on, it reduces the chances of contaminating something that's sitting up against the face," he said.
   
 Some pull masks down while interacting with others, but Weston said removing one's mask to speak to others or wearing the mask around one's neck defeats the purpose.
   
 "The whole point is to create an additional two-way barrier between the air circulating and your respiratory tract," he said.
   
 5) Wearing a mask doesn't replace other pro-active safety measures
   
 According to the CDC, people should wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth while out in public, and emphasizes that this is an additional public health measure to reduce the spread of COVID-19 that should be used in addition to -- not instead of -- other measures such as social distancing, frequent hand cleaning, and other preventative actions.
   
 Facial covers such as cloth masks are recommended for the public in order to help reserve surgical masks and N-95 respirators for health care workers and first-responders.

There will be three new members of the Independence City Council this month.
   
 Two new members had been assured, as one incumbent lost in the primary and another decided not to seek re-election. But in Independence's District 2, generally the northeast portion of the city, Brice Stewart easily ousted two- term incumbent Curt Dougherty.
   
 Stewart, a systems analyst for Jackson County's IT department, garnered 64 percent of the votes to Dougherty's 35 percent - 1,082 to 592.
   
 Mike Steinmeyer and Dan Hobart will be the other new council members.
   
 Hobart, a private practice attorney, is the new representative for District 4, generally the southwest portion of Independence, after he edged Chris Heitzman by just 72 votes - 1,097 (51 percent) to 1,025 (48 percent). Those two had defeated incumbent Tom Van Camp in the primary.
   
 Steinmeyer, a Navy veteran and Realtor, bested Dan O'Neill, 52 to 47 percent, or 1,486 votes to 1,348 in District 3. He will succeed Scott Roberson, who decided not to run again after six years on the council representing the southeast portion.
   
 John Perkins ran unopposed in District 1 and will serve a second term representing the northwest portion.
   
 Stewart ran unsuccessfully against Dougherty four years ago and also has been on the ballot for county sheriff and county legislator in the past few years, but said he was not completely surprised by the win.
   
 "I knew I had a chance, but I thought it would be a close race," Stewart said. "Obviously it's going to be a learning experience."
   
 Stewart, who describes himself a fiscal conservative, said he wouldn't approve smart meters for the city utilities if the matter happened to come up again and vowed to "listen to the people I work for."
   
 Dougherty and Steinmeyer could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.
   
 Hobart said he wants to slow down special projects and focus more on the basics of running through the city right now, though before long he hopes to help push for a city charter review.
   
 "I'm fairly methodical, so I like to get my footing before trying to speed through," Hobart said of joining the council. "Obviously it's a very rough situation we're going to be in with the budget, but that might give us new council members time to really learn."
   
 "(A charter review) would be huge, but it has to be done carefully and thoughtfully."

BOSTON -- U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Tuesday that white Americans need to be asking what they're doing "every day to dismantle a system" that has favored them at the expense of Black people for generations.
 "We cannot simply be allies. We must be anti-racists," Warren said.
 Warren addressed the protests that have been raging for days in cities across the country on a call with business leaders from the New England Council. She had joined the council to discuss her priorities for the next round of coronavirus relief from Congress.
 Slated to begin not long after she spoke, protest groups were gathering near Franklin Park and on Boston Common to demand justice for George Floyd, the unarmed Black man killed in Minneapolis while in police custody, and to call out police brutality.
 "What's happening is the result of racist violence and white supremacy that continues to plague this country and we need to be frank about this," Warren said. "The racist violence that killed George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and far too many Black men and women, it's not new in America and we as a nation, and as a human family, have some serious soul searching to do."
 Warren did not mention President Donald Trump's response to the protests, or his insistence that he would deploy the military if states can't keep the peace on their own. Instead, the Cambridge Democrat called for a justice system that "focuses less on locking people up and more on investing in communities so that we can lift people up."
 She also said racial disparities in health care, education, employment and housing must be rooted out.
 "I believe that this is a moment when white Americans must look with all justice loving people and come together to ask what we're doing every day to dismantle a system that has benefited white people while undervaluing and harming Black people," Warren said.
 Among the priorities Warren listed for the next phase of financial relief from Congress, support for state and local government landed high on her list.
 "The next package must, I underline must, include financial support for states and municipalities, something the entire Massachusetts delegation and I are completely all in and fighting for," Warren said.
 Warren described the situation facing states as two-fold: a loss of revenue and added expenses to react to COVID-19.
 "They're in the worst of all situations. I'm talking to mayors around Massachusetts who say their first line of layoffs could be 20 percent of their workforce. When you're in an economic depression or recession, the last thing you want is local government laying people off," Warren said.
 She also listed her "Essential Workers Bill of Rights," which includes hazard pay for frontline health workers, and support for higher education, research, mental health and a $50 billion child care "bailout" as critical to helping the economy recover.
 "What we're trying to do is stabilize the child care market," Warren said. "The way I see it, child care is critical infrastructure, just like transportation, and we should think of it that way. Parents can't go back to work without reliable and affordable child care and without emergency funding much of the child care centers, many of them are going to close their doors not just temporarily, but forever."
 Many of Warren's initiatives found their way into the latest $3 trillion House relief package, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called a "totally unserious bill."
 "We need to make sure that Senate Republicans come to the table and we need to make sure this next package includes the kinds of values that are essential to helping working families," Warren said, without being specific about how Democrats could make that happen.
 Warren also said she was prepared to fight McConnell over voting by mail, though she hoped Democrats and Republicans could come together on what she said should be a bipartisan goal of making voting safe during the coronavirus pandemic.
 State lawmakers are preparing to vote this week on a package that would direct Secretary of State William Galvin to mail applications for 2020 ballots to vote by mail to every registered voter this summer.
 Warren said there's money in the House relief package to support state efforts like this, as well as to help finance the Post Office.
 "If we have to fight Mitch McConnell on it in the Senate then we will fight him on it, but we need to have that showdown and we need to have it now because we need those procedures in place yesterday, not delaying until after the November election is over," Warren said.

Carson Ross will return for a fourth term as mayor of Blue Springs
   
 Ross won a four-person race for mayor - Blue Springs does not have primary elections - with a little more than one-third of the overall vote in a field that also included one former and two current council members.
   
 The mayor garnered 2,268 votes (34.3 percent) in Tuesday's pandemic-delayed election, ahead of District 2 Council Member Chris Lievsay (1,885 votes, or 28.5 percent), former Council Member Dale Carter (1,633, or 24.7 percent) and District 3 Council Member Susan Culpepper (812, or 12.3 percent).
   
 Even with a four-person race and well-known, accomplished opponents, the 73-year-old Ross said he was not concerned, knowing he'd put in the necessary campaign work to remain viable.
   
 "You can't control everything, but we worked hard to do our part, and we put together a good team," said Ross, who usually had his wife Eloise as campaign treasurer before she passed away last year after a lengthy illness. "We got our message out there, and the people responded to that."
   
 Ross said he could point to the commercial development of Adams Dairy Parkway near Interstate 70, the greater number of sit-down restaurants and the redeveloped White Oak Plaza area at U.S. 40 and Missouri 7 as highlights over his previous 12 years.
   
 "You could take a snapshot, and it's like a tale of two cities," Ross said between when he first took office in 2008 and now.
   
 Becky Nace, Ross' campaign treasurer, noted that other area mayors consider him a leader among them.
   
 "I think the other mayors respect him," Nace said. "He's earned that."
   
 Moving forward, Ross said, he hopes to capitalize on the Faurecia auto parts production plant that opened two years ago in the northeast part of the city.
   
 "I think that area can be the catalyst for more industrial development," he said.
   
 Reiterating an earlier-stated goal, Ross said he wants to put the use tax - essentially a local sales tax for goods purchased online - on the ballot for voters again, and he wants to work on getting parks sales tax renewed.
   
 Also in Blue Springs elections, Kent Edmondson won re-election in District 2 (the middle third of the city) after he beat Byron Craddolph, 926 votes to 709. In District 3 (southern third), Ron Fowler easily won re-election over Benjamin Bitler, 1,565 votes to 609, while incumbent Jerry Kaylor ran unopposed in District 1.

Diceva di essere il diavolo, un vampiro, un lupo mannaro e convinceva le sue vittime, anche minorenni all'epoca dei fatti - marzo e aprile 2019 - a piegarsi alle sue voglie e a soddisfare ogni sua richiesta. Uno studente universitario di 23 anni, residente a Montemurlo, e finito agli arresti domiciliari con l'accusa di violenza sessuale. Il giovane era stato gia indagato a febbraio perche ritenuto il capo di una setta con almeno quattro adepti, tre ragazzi, due dei quali fratelli, e una ragazza. La polizia lo ha arrestato oggi, mercoledi 3 giugno, su mandato del giudice delle indagini preliminari del tribunale di Firenze che, accogliendo la richiesta della Direzione distrettuale antimafia (competente per questo tipo di reato) ha firmato un'ordinanza di custodia cautelare agli arresti domiciliari. Allo studente vengono contestati 13 episodi di violenza sessuale. Secondo l'accusa, avrebbe costretto gli adepti a subire atti sessuali dopo un 'patto con il diavolo'. Il ventitreenne sarebbe riuscito a convincere i suoi seguaci di avere poteri soprannaturali e che con la loro collaborazione sarebbe riuscito a cambiare il mondo. Per essere sicuro di avere il controllo sui giovani, avrebbe anche messo in scena una sorta di resurrezione inscenando, con l'aiuto di un complice, uno strangolamento per poi rialzarsi, sistemarsi il collo e tornare in vita. Non solo: alle vittime avrebbe raccontato che nelle loro vite precedenti avevano avuto identita che solo lui conosceva e che avevano portato a termine la missione di salvare il mondo. Nel tempo, lo studente universitario avrebbe acquisito sui ragazzini una forza psicologica tale da avere su di loro il pieno controllo. Secondo la sua dottrina, gli atti sessuali erano la chiave per liberare i demoni. Gli incontri della setta sarebbero avvenuti nel parco di Galceti, nella zona di Galciana e nei pressi della Multisala a Parco Prato. A far emergere gli abusi sono state le denunce delle famiglie presentate in seguito a un percorso psicologico seguito dai figli.

NORMAL, IL - Students will return to Heartland Community College on-campus facilities in the Fall semester, but not all classes will be held face to face.
   
 All classes with a clinical or hands-on component will take place on campus in a classroom/lab setting with a limit of no more than 10 people per meeting, employing health safety practices.
   
 All other classes that do not require a hands-on component will take place in either a fully online format or a Zoom hybrid format.
   
 Zoom hybrid courses combine online learning with a structured, scheduled Zoom video meeting component that allows for regular, real-time interaction with instructors and classmates. Students are required to attend Zoom meetings during the days/times indicated on the course schedule.
   
 "We have been working tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of our students without compromising the quality of our education," said President Keith Cornille. "After much discussion, as a college we have decided limiting class sizes is necessary to safeguard the well-being of students and staff for the upcoming Fall 2020 semester. Even though our alternative delivery instruction methods are robust, they are not a solution for every class. That is why we will be conducting our hands-on classes with limited numbers and employing a hybrid method where it is needed."
   
 The structure of the Fall courses was greatly informed by a commitment to quality instruction.
   
 "Ensuring quality meant we needed to make a decision about classes now, to let instructors fully prepare their classes. However, if State guidelines allow it, we plan to provide face-to-face student supports such as tutoring and success coaching to ensure students are assisted in their coursework and academic success," said Sarah Diel-Hunt, VP of Enrollment and Student Services. "We are committed to providing the individualized attention and support Heartland is known for and we'll be creative in achieving that, with health safety practices in place, no matter what environment we are in this Fall."
   
 The College has taken great measures to offer high-quality and high-touch online courses. Heartland faculty go through an extensive 96 hour certification course to learn how to teach well in an alternative delivery format and certification is a requirement for the attainment of tenure. Over 95 percent of full time faculty scheduled to teach in Fall of 2020 are currently certified through the course.
   
 In 2019, the College invested in a state-of-the-art platform and infrastructure for online courses with students serving on the selection team.
   
 Some students who have already registered for Fall classes that have changed in format will be required to re-register for the comparable class online. Classes converted to Zoom hybrid format will remain on the existing schedule and students will not be required to re-register.
   
 Advisors will reach out to students whose schedules have been impacted. Classes that were originally in an online format are not affected.
   
 Enrollment assistance is available through the advisement office. Students are asked to email Raab.Advisors@heartland.edu or call 309-268-8027 during regular business hours for assistance or to schedule an appointment.
   
 Heartland continues to offer additional technical support for online students via 24-hour support from the Canvas Learning Management System and the Heartland Online Learning Support page.
   
 Registration for Fall 2020 semester academic classes is open through August 17.

NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) ‚Äî The government of Cyprus accelerated the lifting of most of the country‚Äôs remaining coronavirus restrictions by three weeks, citing on Wednesday the country's consistently low infection rate since the lifting of a stay-at-home order a month ago. Health Minister Constantinos Ioannou said the third phase of the country‚Äôs gradual rollback of restrictions will be completed by June 24 instead of July 14. Starting June 9, shopping malls, airports, the interior seating of hotels, bars and restaurants, and open-air theaters and cinemas will be back in business. Sports events, minus spectators, kindergartens, playgrounds, summer schools and school canteens also are set to reopen on that date. The country‚Äôs casinos, dance schools, gyms, theme and water parks open their doors four days later, according to the government's schedule. A 10-person limit on public gatherings will stay in effect at least until June 24. Indoor cinemas and theaters are expected to open in early August, while music concerts, festivals, wedding and christening receptions and graduation ceremonies will again be permitted on Sept. 1. To date, Cyprus has reported 952 confirmed coronavirus cases and 17 deaths as a direct result of the virus. The government is eager to kick-start foreign tourism, which directly contributes 13% to the country's gross domestic product. Only a handful of hotels are now open to cater to travelers within Cyprus. Commercial flights are set to resume on June 9 from an initial batch of 13 countries, including Germany, Finland, Greece, Austria and Israel, that were selected because of their low infection rates. Passengers will be required to produce health certificates declaring them coronavirus-free. Tourism officials in Cyprus, an east Mediterranean...

School boards and district administrators, tasked with creating plans for reopening schools, will ‚Äì in coordination with health officials ‚Äì make the final determinations of when and how schools reopen. The public health conditions and health of our staff and students are major forces in making these decisions. The idea of returning to a traditional school format presents significant obstacles given all the unknowns facing our community at this time. We know for certain that we are in for an unusual 2020‚Äì2021 school year. Until there is broad availability of vaccines and/or successful treatment solutions for COVID-19, we may face future disruptions to schooling. There is no getting back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for now. Schools are human enterprises where practices like group work, in-person instruction, meals in the cafeteria, assemblies, science labs, hugs, team sports, and sharing are the norm. They are places where loud laughter and playing with friends are observable signs of children growing up. Beyond academics, schools provide social support for children and reliable childcare, without which many parents could not work.
