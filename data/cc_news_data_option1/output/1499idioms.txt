RANTOUL, Ill. (WAND) - A car heavily damaged a Rantoul house after striking it early Thursday, police said.
 Rantoul officers said they responded at about 2:10 a.m. Thursday to the 200 block of Winding Lane. They discovered a car hit a single-family home.
 The home was heavily damaged, police said. Three of its four occupants went by ambulance to a hospital. Their injuries are not believed to be life- threatening.
 One of the home's residents told WAND-TV he pays rent to live there. He said two of his friends were over when the crash happened and were taken to a hospital. At the time of the crash, he was washing dishes.
 Authorities said they arrested the vehicle driver, who was identified as 27-year-old Devontay Sawyer, after he fled the scene. The resident WAND-TV interviewed said the suspect left the car behind.
 Sawyer is charged with leaving the scene of a personal injury accident and other traffic-related offenses. He was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol, according to Lt. Justin Bouse.
 Bouse said it's unclear what exactly caused the crash, but added speed was probably a factor.

LOOKING FOR LINEBACKERS? Linebackers were a glaring weak spot on a defense that's also undergoing a renovation in the offseason.

Whether this oh-so-good liquid is known as soda, Coke or pop in your neck of the woods, anyone would be hard-pressed to beat the 700 flavors an Oklahoma visitor would find at Pops.      Route 66 travelers or those crossing Oklahoma on I-44: It is worth hitting the brakes and making your way to Pops. Yes, it is a gas station but, oh, it is so much more.      Historic Route 66 travelers will recognize Pops by what is deemed to be the largest soda bottle in the world. Standing 66 feet tall, this steel hoop bottle has thousands of LED lights attached and changes colors. When walking up to the shop one can't miss the display of thousands of soda bottles arranged by color in the large glass front of Pops. There are brands one might be familiar with or never heard of. Root beer seems to be one of the best sellers, and it comes in about 80 varieties.      If you can think of a flavor you can probably find it here. Buy one or order a make-your-own case at the kiosk.      It is not a place where one pulls up to the pump, fills the car with gas and walks into this store/restaurant and says, "Coke, please." It takes a lot of time to decide a flavor that fits your day. A soda seeker could get frostbite standing in front of the cooler reading the flavors. It is more like, "Give me a Bawls Guaran Exotic Blue and a Corn Squeezin' Citrus," or "I'll have a Dragon Tail Blazin' Tropical, please." Just reading the flavors will make a traveler get behind on their itinerary by an hour or so.      If you decide to have a bite to eat while visiting this glorified gas station, it is even more difficult. It is an eat-in or take-out restaurant. Pops' burgers are served with a heaping load of Pops Fries. The Pops "Ripper" Dog and Chili Dog are deep-fried quarter-pound all-beef hot dogs. Pops also has an avocado turkey wrap, chicken melt and salads. They offer options of veggie burgers and gluten-free buns.      After enjoying a meal, while still trying to decide a flavor of soda to take on the road, the subject of dessert might come up around the table. The old fashioned soda fountain is known for its milkshakes and floats, and Pops offers hand dipped ice cream, ice cream sandwich sundaes, root beer bread pudding, seasonal cobblers and more.      Pops also offers breakfast -- a signature omelet, buttermilk pancakes, waffles, French Texas toast, biscuits and gravy and, of course, the Mother Road Omelet with breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage, and French toast, pancakes or biscuits and gravy. Maybe breakfast is a great time to try the bacon flavored soda?      Pops opened as a convenience store, souvenir shop and restaurant in 2007. This soda pop stop is a great place for a rest from the road for those traveling in the Sooner State. Pops 66 Soda Ranch is north of Norman, right in the center of Oklahoma, at 660 W. Highway 66 in Arcadia.      At this time, Pops' restaurant is open for carryout only but the convenience store and gas station are open. Visit pops66.com for updates and hours.

“I enjoy democracy immensely. It is incomparably idiotic, and hence incomparably amusing. Does it exalt dunderheads, cowards, trimmers, frauds, cads? Then the pain of seeing them go up is balanced and obliterated by the joy of seeing them come down. Is it inordinately wasteful, extravagant, dishonest? Then so is every other form of government: all alike are enemies to laborious and virtuous men. Is rascality at the very heart of it? Well, we have borne that rascality since 1776, and continue to survive. In the long run, it may turn out that rascality is necessary to human government, and even to civilization itself.”

 HIAWATHA--Hiawatha First Nation has established a checkpoint station to stop non-permanent residents from entering the area or travelling through it.
 Cottagers and other seasonal residents with property at Hiawatha, or those who must travel through the reserve to access their property, are not being allowed access.
 Upon arrival, volunteers at the checkpoint are asking permanent residents to provide their driver's license or a bill, for proof of permanent residency.
 Otonabee-South Monaghan Township Mayor Joe Taylor said he hopes people will understand the objective of the checkpoint.
 "In order to protect that community and the outline area, which includes our township, I'm hoping that our residents will be patient with this slight inconvenience and work with Hiawatha First Nation to make sure that this accomplishes exactly what it's intended to do, and that's to make it safer for everyone," he said.
 Last week, Taylor witnessed people who came up from the GTA who weren't complying with Ontario government and health official rules.
 "We have a boat launch on Indian River in Keene. There were six vehicles at that boat launch. Based on the stickers that were on the vehicles from where they were sold, they were all from the Markham, Whitby, Scarborough area -- all from the GTA," Taylor said.
 Each vehicle had at least three occupants, while some had four or more, he said.
 "It's impossible for me to believe that the occupants of each vehicle were all coming out of the same households," Taylor said.
 "So what I was witnessing was completely flying in the face of the best medical advice that we can get, and that is to avoid non-essential travel, to self-isolate at home, avoid any gathering, and to stay within your own community.
 "I was disappointed, frustrated and somewhat angry when I witnessed what I saw. And what I experienced, every other mayor in every other township around Rice Lake has also experienced."
 According to Taylor, in Ontario, the GTA is the "hot bed" for COVID-19.
 "So how many folks do you want travelling out of the GTA into your community right now. Like really truly none," he said.
 "Coming up to your cottage for a weekend or a week right now is not essential. You have a home already, you should stay there."
 Despite the strong recommendation of putting any non-essential travel to a halt, Peterborough County Warden J. Murray Jones said many cottagers feel they have the right to be able to do what they want.
 "The whole reason we're saying this is because the provincial health authorities, as well as our own health unit, are saying please stay home, don't go to your cottage, and let's get this situation over with," Jones said.
 "It's got nothing to do with whether we want cottagers or don't want cottagers. Of course we want them, we welcome them with open arms. The bottom line is, we're trying to save people's lives and we're trying to stop this virus from spreading."
 Jones said he understands cottagers' frustrations.
 "I've got a cottage too that I can't go to, so I get it," Jones said.
 With cottagers continuing to come, the county won't have enough resources if there's an outbreak, he said.
 "We only have one hospital. Not like the GTA where there's lots of them," Jones said.
 Trent Lakes Mayor Janet Clarkson said hospitals won't be a concern until there's an outbreak.
 "The trick is to make sure that we isolate to the point that we don't get to that," she said.
 Clarkson said there will be another surge of cottagers arriving to the county in the middle of May.
 As of right now, there are no plans to establish other checkpoints in Peterborough County, Jones said.
 Curve Lake First Nation added a similar checkpoint earlier this month because of the pandemic.

He had earlier in the day chaired a meeting with district collectors to take stock of preventive measures that are in place across the state.

Well, that’s an interesting question, but I’ll attempt to answer it. With a haul of 11 free agents, counting TE Michael Roberts who was signed before the new League Year, Miami’s managed to fill some of the holes the exited 2019 with. Perhaps most important, despite shelling out big money deals, all of them are structured in smart, team-friendly ways. Kudos to Chris Grier and Brandon Shore for that. It’ll pay dividends down the road.

Last Tuesday, voters in Wisconsin who hadn’t successfully sent in absentee ballots and still wanted to vote took great personal risk by going to the polls. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling helped that to happen, demonstrating that the Republican majority on the court is now, indeed, a partisan, Republican majority. The decision made it clear that the courts are willing to play ball with any voter suppression scheme that makes it to them (as, indeed, they mostly have since John Roberts became chief justice and they eviscerated the protections of the Voting Rights Act.) With the court’s partisan goal in place, innovative solutions to the question of how to have a fair election in the time of coronavirus are near to impossible.

Kathryn Salensky, an attorney who operates the Mid Hudson Elder Justice Project and George's Justice hotline, which provides advocacy services to seniors in Dutchess, Columbia and Greene counties, according to its website, said residents of the Grand Rehabilitation and Nursing, River Valley in Poughkeepsie have reached out to her, as well.

Lausanne [Switzerland], April 16 (ANI): The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Thursday said that it will continue to assess and discuss the impacts caused by the postponement of the games along with the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee.   "The key elements of the planning for 2021 should replicate the existing Games Delivery Plan for 2020. Particular focus will be placed on the venues and the competition schedule, which were originally agreed by all stakeholders as the best plan for the 2020 edition. On this basis, the Japanese side including Tokyo 2020 will request that each planned venue owner organises the Games according to this schedule on the new dates in 2021. The Japanese side will also seek understanding for these preparations," IOC said in a statement.   "On the basis of Olympic Agenda 2020, the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and all Olympic and Paralympic Movement stakeholders, in conjunction with Japanese side including the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, will explore all opportunities to optimise and streamline the scope and service levels at the Games, and reduce the costs that have been caused by the postponement. The IOC and the Japanese side, including the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, will continue to assess and discuss jointly about the respective impacts caused by the postponement," the statement added.   The Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Tokyo 2020) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) met today for an Executive Project Review via teleconference.   IOC Coordination Commission Chair John Coates and Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi joined Tokyo 2020 President Mori Yoshiro and CEO Muto Toshiro for the meeting.   The 2020 Tokyo Olympic games were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the games will take place from July 23 to August 8 next year while the Paralympics Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021.   IOC said that the process to deliver the Games in 2021 is overseen by a Joint Steering Committee which is led by Coates and Yoshiro.   The meetings of the Joint Steering Committee will be held whenever necessary, in order to ensure permanent coordination and efficient decision-making.   Also, to support the Joint Steering Committee, Tokyo 2020 and the IOC will each have their own respective task forces. The "Here we go" Task Force on the IOC side, and the "New Launch" Task Force on the Tokyo 2020 side.   Coates, after the meeting, said he believes that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics can stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times.   "Since the postponement of Tokyo 2020 to 2021 was agreed a few weeks ago, the strong spirit of collaboration between the IOC, the IPC, the Olympic Movement, Tokyo 2020 and the Japanese authorities has already allowed us to bring some clarity and certainty to athletes, fans and stakeholders around the world. The principles outlined today will allow us to continue in this spirit, and to answer the many questions that remain, in as efficient a manner as possible," Coates said in a statement.   "We believe that the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 can stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times, and that the Olympic flame can be the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present. The Joint Steering Committee will give its all to ensure that this is the case," he added.   Yoshiro commented, "Soon after the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Games on 24 March 2020, Tokyo 2020 established a 'New Launch' Task Force on 26 March and we have been working since then to create a structure capable of overcoming these unprecedented challenges. We believe that today's new step is an important achievement in advancing over the coming year what we have prepared over the past five to six years. We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to ensure the success of the Games." (ANI)

Like Ryan White, the child who provided a face for the AIDS crisis a generation ago, Charlotte Figi humanized the struggle for those who sought solace in revolutionary and controversial treatments. Because of her willingness to go public with the illness, and because of her parents’ deep love, Charlotte was able to remove the stigma that had been unfairly placed on medical cannabis. People were finally able to see just how this treatment, in its many variations, could save lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I watched a segment on CNN where Sanjay Gupta spoke about Charlotte, and could barely keep his composure. The doctor had been a vocal and notable critic of the benefits of medical cannabis, doubting its efficacy (although rarely its safety.) However, after having spent significant time with Charlotte, and telling her story, he became convinced of the truly therapeutic impact CBD could have, particularly on children whose immune systems are much more delicate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is particularly cruel that Charlotte Figi could survive and become a success story at such a young age, and give very substantial hope to other children who suffered from seizure disorders, but then would succumb to the pandemic that is swirling around us. In words that approached poetry, Charlotte’s mother announced her death by writing “Charlotte is no longer suffering. She is seizure-free forever.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  While there is some comfort in the knowledge that this warrior child is finally at peace, the price that she had to pay is far too high. This virus has stolen far too much, far too many moments of joy, far too many lives, and even the unappreciated pleasures of normalcy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  That Charlotte Figi was among these losses triggers a sadness that transcends normal comprehension. But her legacy, as that of Ryan and Alex, lives on in the memory of those who themselves will live on, because of their journeys, and their courage.

It gets curiouser as you go up the food chain. While there is already a petition that Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State diverted 23 trailer loads of relief materials sent to the state for COVID-19, the Northern Governor’s Forum is asking for money to fight the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Forum did not say what the money would be used for – PPE, ventilators, test centres and kits, allowances for medical personnel, palliatives – or what?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Yet, we’re told, in the name of COVID-19, that the states need money -- money that may not reach the millions of people in lockdown at home, money that will not be accounted for or deployed even remotely for the benefit of citizens. And we must accept more restriction as reward for this hubris?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In the end, it would be every man for himself. The earlier people are allowed to go out and begin to put their lives back together again, the better for everyone before the cure gets more deadly than the disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         _Ishiekwene is the MD/Editor-in-Chief of The Interview_

_Wowee Zowee_ blew my mind in high school. I couldn’t believe one album could fly so dramatically between different genres and moods. This album is also really funny to me, there are tons of bizarre lyrics. My favorite song is “AT&T” which I feel like is a good example because it tugs at my heartstrings for reasons I don’t understand and has lyrics like “Spritzer on ice in New York City.”

The fact that BMW trademarked "X8 M" and not just "X8," also suggests that an X7 M might also be on the way. Just as there have been rumors of an X8 since the X7 was first introduced, there have also been rumors that the automaker would release a high-performance variant of the SUV.  Currently, the most powerful X7 is the M50i, which has a a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that churns out 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. As impressive as that may sound, BMW enthusiasts have come to expect closer to 600 horses from the brand's M models. Time will tell whether the marque will meet or surpass those expectations.

One owner mentioned a hypothetical scenario in which players began a month-long training camp in early June to work back into shape, followed by the conclusion of the regular season and the Finals ending in October. The league could also go straight into the playoffs — perhaps also shortening series to best-of-five — thus giving the league more time to return, while also limiting the number of people who will need to be confined together and the amount of tests needed for the league.

But they never made another record like that again. It was almost like they got their noses batted back and they said: “Well, we’ll never do THAT again”. Their next two records had great songs, but that sense of “anything goes” was gone. Like they’d been grounded. Or like they were trying to please the people who hated _Wowee Zowee_. And that pissed me off because FUCK those people!

In contrast to the people aiming to sell hand sanitizer for $40 or more on Amazon, one current business that is under fire for its exploitation of panic is Judy. With the slogan “Ready Set Judy,” Judy was created in January of this year. The company’s mission is to sell emergency kits, intended to “prepare” people for survival and disaster. With a total of four emergency kits, ranging from $60 to $250, Judy kits most certainly do not come cheap. “The Safe,” Judy’s most expensive emergency kit, comes with seven items, including an iPhone charger and one roll of duct tape.

Sadly, while it may be a fact that those over 60 are most vulnerable to contracting severe COVID-19, and therefore most needful of practicing social distancing, this same group has the lowest skill in using and access to online technologies that allow remote social connecting. Even if it turns out that age alone is not a predictor of who gets the most severe cases of the virus, or if the virus has mutated in order to widen its circle of victims, it’s still the case that on the whole, older people have weaker immune systems and higher across-the-board risk factors, such as heart disease and lung conditions. And it is hard when social distancing has to mean social isolation, because one is not able to use remote connecting devices beyond the telephone. Social isolation itself is a risk factor! All of the activities I was planning to highlight here back in late February and early March (because yes, dear reader, I really do that much research) are now totally cancelled, or moved to a virtual space, if they could be. So, instead, it’s back to the drawing board, and dedicating this whole month’s column to coronavirus and using technology to stay connected.

Rather than letting our worries get the better of us, as Chamberlain seems to have done, we must work to harness their power as Stanton, Mandela and Marsh did. The pandemic leaves us worried about our health, our finances and our priorities. But anxiety in the face of real uncertainties like these is essential to being appropriately emotionally attuned — after all, these are things we should be worried about. Anxiety can help us appreciate our values, reflect on our priorities and so come to better decisions about what to do as covid-19 scrambles our lives.

You can then use those pictures on your website, and the goods stay in the same place. That’s exactly how we used to work. We’ve got modern technology to do an old job. That’s the catchphrase for it.

Like other companies that have announced cuts, Conoco is mostly reducing U.S. production, which tends to be easier to turn off and on. Large offshore projects are harder to stop than shale drilling, for instance. The lower 48 states account for 29% of Conoco’s production, the largest segment of its business.

That’s easier for some than for others. The coronavirus has put politics on the back burner for many. Rallies and fundraisers — where potential vice presidential candidates might essentially audition for the position — are barely happening. Meanwhile, governors in the running might seem to have an advantage as their official day job becomes a public test of their ability to handle a crisis in the spotlight.

These lenses have a higher aperture (read: they let in less light), so the lighting doesn't look quite right. The difference in color balance between it and the main lens on either phone is night and day. Unless Motorola issues a miracle solution, I wouldn't suggest trusting it. In my tests, the standard lens on each phone was more than capable of capturing close-ups, and especially with the megapixel bump on the G Stylus, you'll get a much sharper image at the expense of not being able to be super close to the subject.

"Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available," Bezos said in the letter, which offers a rare window into the thinking of the world's richest man and his plans for the company he founded.

The web event will be emceed by Flagstaff businessman, conservationist and historian Jim Babbitt and will feature talks from Mayor Coral Evans, Coconino County Supervisor Art Babbott, Chair of the Board of County Supervisors Liz Archuleta as well as many other community leaders and public officials.
 “We’ll be asking our elected officials what is the importance of earth day to them, and what is their plan for combating climate change on this 50th anniversary?” Dr. Stefan Sommer, NAU professor of biology and Director of Education for Merriam-Powell Center for Environmental Research, says. “We’ll be curious to hear from each of them, and see what their vision for how Flagstaff can come to grips with climate change in a way that strengthens the local economy and strengthens people's livelihoods.

Siblings Julio Cesar, left, and Carmen Castellanos wear face masks as they wait for customers behind a protective sheet of plastic hanging over the counter in El Foquito, the hardware and electric supply store they own in the Benito Juarez district of Mexico City, Wednesday, April 15, 2020. The Castellanos family used their hardware skills and supplies to hand-make more than 100 face shields which they donated to medical staff at two hospitals in the capital.

And by the way, a number of states, driven by fear, ignorance or indifference, are doing their own thing. How did we arrive at 14 days extension, instead of one week or even three? And what exactly is the plan after the extension?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Government may already have an idea what it intends to do. It has said it won’t fire public servants, but would do all it can to help farmers and start-ups. But with a recent forecast by Agusto Consulting that the post-COVID-19 economy could recess more than in 2016 and oil prices at $30 per barrel, where is the money coming from?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Private sector employers are watching closely, asking themselves why in the perilous and uncertain days ahead they should go back to the number of staff they had pre-COVID-19 lockdown, knowing what they now know technology can do. There’ll be very painful trade-offs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Public anger and resentment about the extension is not because people do not value their lives. Or because they want to harm others. It’s largely because they think some people are using the lockdown to make money and enrich themselves while preventing the mass of the population who live from hand-to-mouth, from going out to help themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I know a hair dresser who provides only home service because she cannot afford the cost of renting a shop. Her husband is a conductor who barely gets enough daily to make ends meet. How will the couple cope with their three children when the woman cannot go out to make customers’ hair and the man cannot leave home because commercial buses are grounded for four weeks?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The man does not need to tell me. Like millions of Nigerians in his shoes, he will go out, even if it kills him. Every single avoidable death is sad. But who says that at the end of this extension, even by current data, there’ll be fewer deaths from the virus than there would be from malaria, Lassa fever or armed robbery over the same period?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       How do we save people from COVID-19 and save COVID-19 from becoming another scam?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Take, for example, the announcement by the Federal Government that it would distribute as palliatives, 150 trailer-loads of rice seized by Customs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        If the 150 trailer-loads of rice were shared equally across the 36 states -- from Lagos with over 20 million people to Bayelsa with 1.7m -- each will get about 2,500 bags, since each trailer contains roughly 600 bags. But ten days after the announcement, nothing has been seen or heard yet. The intention may be great, but the sheer cost of the logistics would make the exercise prone to abuse. The idea that any African government can feed people is a pathetic joke.

"The Book: A Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of Our Time” by Keith Houston is a wonderfully diverting and informative read. A book, for some experts, is something written, bound in a cover, and expresses a “world view.” This excludes works etched on Mesopotamian clay tablets since they’re coverless and are usually legal or financial accounts. Even the earliest editions of “Gilgamesh,” the world’s oldest literature and certainly containing a “world view,” are excluded. Meanwhile, papyrus scrolls have bindings and pass muster. However, other less restrictive experts consider the term “book” more broadly, as an idea instead of an object. Homer’s “Iliad,” for example, originated in oral tradition but was a book before it was actually written.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  So, it’s difficult for the professionals to agree on the world’s oldest book. Reading Houston’s description of the Pharaoh Narmer, who reigned around 3,000 BCE touched on writing history. Narmer was an accomplished ruler who unified Upper and Lower Egypt, founded one of my favorite cities, Shebet (aka Crocodopolis) on the Nile, and invented “restaurant-style table service.” He also instituted the first full national census — something we should all participate in today as well — and invented (or, more likely, ordered and approved the creation of) hieroglyphic writing. A famously complicated writing system, hieroglyphics was a revolutionary communications technology 5,000 years ago that was modified over the centuries into less formal and easier-to-write scripts. Combined with light-weight, compact papyrus scrolls, Narmer’s hieroglyph vastly increased the flow of information, and armies of scribes, those protolibrarians who trained for years to master the art, then created libraries to house their rapidly multiplying writings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Most agree that one of the oldest books, the “Prisse Papyrus,” a collection of wise sayings by a powerful vizier named Ptahhotep, was written around 1,900 BCE. When the 110-year-old Ptahhotep was ready to retire, he asked his pharaoh to replace him with his son. His wish was granted only if he’d first compile his many maxims for living life properly. This compilation covered everything from table manners, to court etiquette, to “handy hints to the husband for preserving his wife’s beauty.” He also emphasized filial obedience, humility, faithfulness, and “the ability to keep silent when necessary,” all useful traits in today’s leaders.

“El señor de los cielos” estrenará su séptima temporada en Netflix este viernes 17 de abril. La producción de Telemundo llegará a la plataforma streaming para contar el desenlace de la exitosa serie que llevó a la cima a Rafael Amaya y lo posicionó como uno de los actores más populares de los últimos años.  En esta entrega, el intérprete mexicano regresa luego de estar ausente desde la sexta temporada que sorpresivamente cayó en coma y dejó a muchos de sus seguidores con una duda que meses después explicaba el porqué de sus desaparición de la historia. Los representantes de Rafael Amaya confirmaron que el actor contrajo histoplasmosis, enfermedad causada por un hongo (o moho) llamado histoplasma. Al parecer, durante la grabación de uno de los episodios en una cueva de Estambul, Turquía, el actor y otros integrantes del equipo de producción habrían contraído esta rara enfermedad. En el lugar encontraron murciélagos, uno de los principales transmisores de histoplasmosis.  Desde abril de 2018, Rafael Amaya desapareció de las pantallas y las redes sociales, así que esto ocasionó que muchos de sus fans se preocupen por la vida del actor mexicano. Por aquel entonces y en una entrevista para la revista People, el mexicano dijo que se encontraba recuperándose de su enfermedad, ya que su voz se había visto afectada, así que por esta razón su personaje quedó en coma, pero nunca más regresó a los set de grabaciones. Desde ese momento se desató un sinfín de comentarios alrededor del actor. Algunos hablaban de una pelea judicial con Telemundo por la enfermedad que contrajo, otro dijeron que el actor había iniciado una relación sentimental con una modelo colombiana que lo tenía secuestrado en su propia casa, presuntamente porque Rafael Amaya es adicto al sexo y su pareja lo convencía para no salir y quedarse juntos. También se escuchó decir que el popular ‘Aurelio Casillas’ se había dejado llevar por los excesos y estaba llevando una mala vida social. Finalmente, ni uno de estos rumores se pudo comprobar, pero lo que sí hizo Telemundo fue respaldar a su artista exclusivo e informar que regresaría a “El señor de los cielos” y así fue, el actor regresó pero solo para darle fin a su personaje. Esto situación ocasionó que muchos de sus fans se sientan decepcionados de la cadena de televisión por darle fin a “Aurelio Casillas”, uno de los personajes más queridos.   Por ese mismo tiempo, la hermana del actor se encargó de poner un alto a todas las especulaciones que han rodeado la vida del intérprete en estos últimos meses. Fátima Amaya utilizó su cuenta de Instagram para publicar un par de fotos del mexicano y mostró que el intérprete se encuentra bien. Según la revista People en Español, las imágenes de Rafael junto a su familia fueron tomadas a principios de marzo de 2019 durante la celebración del cumpleaños del actor (nacido el 28 de febrero). En las imágenes se logró ver a un Rafael Amaya muy sonriente disfrutando junto a sus seres queridos de una linda fiesta de cumpleaños en su México natal.   Luego del estreno de “El señor de los cielos” 7 y la muerte de “Aurelio Casillas” en el primer capítulo no se ha vuelto a saber más de actor y nuevamente los fans se encuentran en una gran incertidumbre. Solo nos queda esperar que el actor comunique cuales son sus nuevos proyectos y si pronto regresará a las pantallas.

The Londoners pinned United back inside their own half for long spells at the Emirates Stadium, only for Louis van Gaal's side to lead against the run of play through Kieran Gibbs' 56th-minute own goal.
 Wayne Rooney added a second on the break before the returning Olivier Giroud pulled a goal back in stoppage time.
 "It's a game that we dominated for 80 per cent of the time and it's a long time since we dominated games against Man United like we did today," said Wenger, whose eighth-place side are 15 points behind leaders Chelsea after 12 games.
 "But at the end of the day we were not efficient enough in the final third offensively and made a mistake at the back and they took advantage of it.
 "We had plenty of chances, their keeper [David de Gea] was man of the match but that was the story of the game.
 "We played with freedom and we pressed them very high. We won balls back and had plenty of opportunities to finish this game off.
 "We made a big mistake on the first goal and when we were 1-0 down we were too impatient, were not cautious enough and we gave a second goal away."
 Wenger's misery was compounded by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny and midfielder Jack Wilshere leaving the field through injury.
 Szczesny was injured when he collided with Gibbs in failing to collect the cross that led to United's opener.
 Wenger does not believe the Poland international is seriously hurt but Wilshere, who has a long history of ankle problems, is a cause for greater concern after he went down under a robust challenge from United defender Paddy McNair.
 "Wojciech is not bad; Jack, I don’t know how bad it is because he tried to stay on and he couldn't," Wenger added.
 "It's an ankle problem - I don’t know honestly how bad it is."

 Sen. Bernie Sanders has suspended his campaign for the presidency, but not his campaign for socialism, and I do mean socialism. It's often said that, by any true definition of the term, he falls way short. In fact, if you check out his policy proposals, he's there, definitely there, and we still have leftist cheers for a transition conceivably made more likely by the coronavirus pandemic.
 What Sanders wants is collective control of the economy, of production, distribution and trade, a definition of socialism. He wants private property to become more nearly public property. He wants something amounting to nationalization of medical care and the energy industry. Sanders, who has said nice things about murderous, impoverishing socialist regimes, says capitalism, which has saved millions from poverty, is about corruption, greed and exploitation.
 He says a populist \"political revolution\" transforming the economy is in order and has told us how he would go about it. First off, he is going to get rid of millions of jobs. Seven million of those are in the hydraulic fracking business that he misleadingly contends is guilty of water contamination.
 Then, within a decade, he wants to rid the country of all fossil fuels, which would give us another American shutdown. Energy would become a governmental industry, hiring people as part of a plan to guarantee that all Americans who want to work will work, a total of at least 20 million.
 Common-sense means of dealing with climate change are available, but Sanders can't ponder those because he is too busy figuring out how to expand virtually all our social programs and start a host of new ones.
 Joe Biden has now pushed Sanders aside in the presidential race, but Democratic voters have a more positive view of socialism than capitalism; 75% say they would vote for a socialist and half of millennials are pro-socialism. Some online analyses tell us in so many words that we will learn from the coronavirus crisis that central planners must be trusted, that businesses need to do what they cannot afford, that big government is a wonder and that emergency measures for the down-and-out will illustrate that we can keep them forever.
 We are told that if the rich stay rich with others in quicksand, the outcry will be ear-scorching and change will come. Sanders himself, who already has brought Biden to his side on a few major matters, will be pushing for his dream, and just maybe the socialist march will begin with force and in earnest.
 My own hope is that we remember how important it is for us to care for each other while still preserving liberty, understanding that our unexampled, uplifting American achievements were built on respect for the individual, for private property, for a non-authoritarian republic, for free markets and for the profound if unsurprising truth that money does not grow on trees.

Assuming golf gets the green light from government and health officials, the tour then would have an official tournament every week through Dec. 6 except for a Thanksgiving break.

Skocic’s side do indeed have grounds for optimism. Their next two fixtures will be against Hong Kong and Cambodia, who on paper at least, should be beatable. They will then host current group frontrunners Bahrain and Iraq, which should give them a shot at claiming one of the group’s two qualifying spots in the next round. "We have to be professional and respect all the teams, including Cambodia and Hong Kong."

It was a tough decision to make, but it turned out to be the right one when those in charge cancelled the first-ever First Responders and Military/Veteran Appreciation Dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A day before the March 12 event, which was to be held at Grace Chapel (old Shopko building), the Minerva Rotary Club decided to pull the plug on the dinner due to the COVID-10 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A lot of time, effort and planning had gone into transforming the banquet room into a beautiful tribute to first responders, as well as military and veteran personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Former Minerva superintendent Mike Gallina was set to be the master of ceremonies, and a family-style dinner was going to be provided by the local Amish community.

Here’s the timeline, to use another term favored in this soap opera. On April 8, the Journal hit a nerve with an editorial noting, “Mr. Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him.” Within hours a presidential tweet responded with the favorite expression, “Fake News!” On April 11, the New York Times published a lengthy report detailing the administration’s slow, or at least uneven, response to the coronavirus outbreak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Similar stories appeared in the Washington Post and via the Associated Press. On April 12, Dr. Anthony Fauci, lead medical adviser on the coronavirus task force, was interviewed by CNN’s Jake Tapper and was obliged to concede the obvious: Earlier mitigation against the virus could have saved lives. He added that there was “pushback” against such mitigation. Within hours the president retweeted criticism of Dr. Fauci that closed with, “Time to #FireFauci.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It was against that background that Trump decided to treat the White House press corps and viewers of multiple TV outlets to his video mash-up. CNN and MSNBC cut away during part of it. After rejoining, CNN’s on-screen summaries included, “Angry Trump turns briefing into propaganda session” and “Trump melts down…”

Reinsdorf ultimately won out; Jordan sat out 64 games that season before returning for the playoffs.

“This song is about Hollywood as a place where people go to make their fantasies come to life, and they end up exploiting other people and doing terrible things to maintain their fantasy,” bandleader Will Toledo, whose alter ego Trait appears in the video in animated form, said in a statement. “There's this terror you're going to lose the fantasy, and you're going to have to face the facts, and some people will do anything to avoid facing that. It’s about that fear, and the pain of being subjugated to someone else's fantasy against your will, and it's all tied together under this banner of this physical location of Hollywood that we all know about and dream about, but none of us really want to think about what is going on behind the scenes there.”

Denver has a pretty good group of starters but the team is lacking depth across the board. If any of the team's starters are injured (like Callahan was last year), the secondary will suffer greatly.

The primary thing diabetic educators do is take care of new diabetics, Trudgen said. When a new diabetic is identified, having come into the hospital, the educators meet with the patient to make sure they have everything they need to take care of their new diagnosis. Then the group meets the third Thursday of the month at 6 p.m. Now they will meet via the online platform Zoom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The platform has brought with it a few changes. Typically, they have physicians who are guest speakers every month, but that is no longer the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “So my two diabetic educators that typically lead the support group, they’ve decided to still have the meeting and what they’re going to do is they’re going to share some best practices and research around COVID-19,” Trudgen said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  After sharing those resources, according to Trudgen, they’ll leave time for questions and answers, as well as talk about changes people have had to make, things they might have had to do differently in light of the pandemic. So, he said, the format will be different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “The other limiting factor might be, maybe not as many people will be able to attend,” Trudgen said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There was an email sent out beforehand to see if people would be interested and not everybody responded, he noted.

Assuming golf gets the green light from government and health officials, the tour then would have an official tournament every week through Dec. 6 except for a Thanksgiving break.

Mathunny Mathews (popularly known as Toyota Sunny), was the mastermind behind the evacuation of Indian citizens from Kuwait in 1990. He negotiated a plan with Iraqi carriers, Indian authorities, and the UN to move all Indians to Amman through from Baghdad and in refugee camps on buses. This meant 60 people per bus, around 200 buses, and 10 bus trips over 1,200 km each way; It was a logistical marvel but luckily it was completed without any major setbacks. In the film, Akshay Kumar plays Ranjit Katyal, a Kuwaiti businessman with friends in high places. He considers himself more Kuwaiti than Indian, and the film follows his internal journey as he deals with the problem of driving a safe passage not only for his immediate family but also for the thousands stranded there due to the war. Nimrat plays his wife, Amrita, someone who is tired of the lifestyle of her husband's tycoon and someone who comes to love him again when she witnesses the changes within him. The gritty recreation of the war zone, most of the film was shot in the UAE and certain areas were recreated to look like the 90s in Kuwait, it is the highlight of the film. The scenes of the crowd, as well as those of assault and arson, seem real.

Johannesburg [South Africa], April 16 (ANI): South Africa pacer Lungi Ngidi said the team is moving in the right direction despite admitting that there is still a lot of work to be done.   "The team did very well in the end, there were a lot of steps in the right direction. Obviously, there's still a lot of work to be done but it was very good to see those wins... I just think you can see the other teams have had these teams for a very long time and we've got probably another four or five new guys that have come into the team now," Ngidi said in a statement.   "For us it's obviously a different phase but it's moving in the right direction. It was good to see the wins that were happening but there's still a bit of work to do," he added.   It has been a challenging home summer for South Africa as they lost their only Test series 3-1 to England before the 50-over world champions drew the ODI leg of the tour (1-1) and won their three-match T20I series 2-1.   The team also suffered a defeat in the T20 series (2-1) against Australia but bounced back to beat the same opponents 3-0 in the ODIs.   After making his international debut in 2017, Nigidi's sustained several injuries. He had missed South Africa's four-match Test series against England in December and January after sustaining a hamstring injury during the Mzansi Super League (MSL).   "I'd say the road back to cricket wasn't as bad as people think. I'm not shy to work hard, so it wasn't an unfamiliar area for me and to be honest, I didn't feel as though I was down and out," he said.   "Like I've always said, every person has a different formula and I was still trying to figure mine out and going to (fitness) camp with the CoE (Cricket South Africa Centre of Excellence in January) helped me do that. I figured out that I've probably got to work a lot harder than than other people. It doesn't come as naturally. So it just helped me and put me down the right path," Ngidi added. (ANI)

To do this she had to be brave, some call it risky, too risky, some call it hustling or entrepreneurial. Yes, she stretched her cash flow, but most of us who have run a business know what that’s like. It took a major virus, and then the governor shutting down her industry to cause her to crash and burn. I admit, I do love and admire her, but my heart weeps for the state of her workers in our neighborhood.

A day before the March 12 event, which was to be held at Grace Chapel (old Shopko building), the Minerva Rotary Club decided to pull the plug on the dinner due to the COVID-10 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A lot of time, effort and planning had gone into transforming the banquet room into a beautiful tribute to first responders, as well as military and veteran personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Former Minerva superintendent Mike Gallina was set to be the master of ceremonies, and a family-style dinner was going to be provided by the local Amish community.

The Frenchman has seen his side make a mixed start to the campaign, with injuries to the likes of Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy and Mesut Ozil playing a part.
 A recent upturn in form sees Arsenal head ino Tuesday's UEFA Champions League clash with Anderlecht at the Emirates Stadium seeking a fourth consecutive win in all competitions.
 And Wenger is set for a further boost with several of his injured players close to joining England winger Theo Walcott in making their returns to action.
 "We had a lot of long-term injuries of course," he said. "We had Giroud, Theo, Debuchy, Ozil and David Ospina as well.
 "Slowly all the long-term injuries are getting better and Theo Walcott is the first to come back. I believe there is light at the end of the tunnel."
 Wenger confirmed he will once more be without Jack Wilshere. The England international was missing from Saturday's 3-0 win over Burnley with a knee injury and sits out on Tuesday through illness.
 A victory over Anderlecht could secure Arsenal's place in the knockout stages, if Borussia Dortmund beat Galatasaray in Group D's other encounter.
 However, after needing two late goals to see off Anderlecht 2-1 in the reverse fixture on October 22, Wenger is taking nothing for granted.
 "We are at home and we have an opportunity to win the game," he added. "We are on a good run and we want to take advantage of that.
 "We respect Anderlecht because they gave us a tough game. We had a little bit of a miraculous win because we needed to go until the last minute.
 "We have been warned. We have learned a lot from the first game and we want to win at the Emirates now."

This increase will help those workers laid off or unable to work because of the virus pay bills and make ends meet, replacing most, if not all, of their lost wages in the near term. The bill also lengthens the time an unemployed worker can receive regular benefits from the current maximum 26 weeks to 39 weeks, but that extension doesn’t include the additional $600 per week.

In late July 2019, I was at my family's cabin, and someone in my extended family signed us all up for a 5k race.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I walked the entire time, pushing my son in his stroller, and I was exhausted at the end of it. I remember feeling so out of sorts and having a moment where I thought to myself, _what has my life come to?_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I couldn't push my son's stroller for three miles. I felt like I was failing him as a mother. I never, ever wanted to be a mother who was unable to do things with her kids. That was the turning point for me. On August 12, 2019, at 31 years old, I decided to take the plunge and finally get healthy once and for all.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has suspended his campaign for the presidency, but not his campaign for socialism, and I do mean socialism. It's often said that, by any true definition of the term, he falls way short. In fact, if you check out his policy proposals, he's there, definitely there, and we still have leftist cheers for a transition conceivably made more likely by the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 What Sanders wants is collective control of the economy, of production, distribution and trade, a definition of socialism. He wants private property to become more nearly public property. He wants something amounting to nationalization of medical care and the energy industry. Sanders, who has said nice things about murderous, impoverishing socialist regimes, says capitalism, which has saved millions from poverty, is about corruption, greed and exploitation.
   
 He says a populist "political revolution" transforming the economy is in order and has told us how he would go about it. First off, he is going to get rid of millions of jobs. Seven million of those are in the hydraulic fracking business that he misleadingly contends is guilty of water contamination.
   
 Then, within a decade, he wants to rid the country of all fossil fuels, which would give us another American shutdown. Energy would become a governmental industry, hiring people as part of a plan to guarantee that all Americans who want to work will work, a total of at least 20 million.
   
 Common-sense means of dealing with climate change are available, but Sanders can't ponder those because he is too busy figuring out how to expand virtually all our social programs and start a host of new ones.
   
 Joe Biden has now pushed Sanders aside in the presidential race, but Democratic voters have a more positive view of socialism than capitalism; 75% say they would vote for a socialist and half of millennials are pro-socialism. Some online analyses tell us in so many words that we will learn from the coronavirus crisis that central planners must be trusted, that businesses need to do what they cannot afford, that big government is a wonder and that emergency measures for the down-and-out will illustrate that we can keep them forever.
   
 We are told that if the rich stay rich with others in quicksand, the outcry will be ear-scorching and change will come. Sanders himself, who already has brought Biden to his side on a few major matters, will be pushing for his dream, and just maybe the socialist march will begin with force and in earnest.
   
 My own hope is that we remember how important it is for us to care for each other while still preserving liberty, understanding that our unexampled, uplifting American achievements were built on respect for the individual, for private property, for a non-authoritarian republic, for free markets and for the profound if unsurprising truth that money does not grow on trees.

RALEIGH, N.C.

With the 3-3-5 package, there’s really two versions: The Bear front and the slide front. The Bear front typically included bigger defensive lineman to cover the opponents G-C-G with Hightower and Trey Flowers or Kyle Van Noy on edges, with Van Noy or Elandon Roberts off-ball. Think of the slide front as really a 4-2 front, but you have an OLB playing as a stand-up DE.

I came across this place during my early-lockdown wanderings. Its name is misleading, for this is not a park full of green space, but rather part nature reserve, part cemetery. It is, in fact, one of London’s “Magnificent Seven” grand cemeteries, built in the 1800s to accommodate the overflowing inner city burial grounds. Abney Park opened nearly 180 years ago and sits on 13 hectares of woodland - a true luxury when we’re cooped up within the same four walls day in, day out.

At Jefferies, analysts Owen Bennett and Ryan Tomkins have refreshed their cannabis industry forecast in light of the expected impact of Covid-19. They, too, like Aphria. But they are upgrading their rating on Canopy to a Hold after the stock’s recent selloff. In a recession, the company’s strong balance sheet means that it won’t need to raise capital through equity sales, they say. Canopy’s size and inventory position will let it weather supply disruptions. Jefferies thinks Canopy’s $14.50 stock would be fairly valued at $15.60.

A former player in the SPHL, Kallechy transitioned from player to coach with the Huntsville Havoc, where he worked as an assistant coach for a few seasons. Following the Havoc's Championship in 2017-2018, Kallechy was offered his first Head Coach gig with the Fayetteville Marksmen after incredible potential was seen in him from Marksmen CEO Chuck Norris.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "From the start, I knew Jesse was going to do a great job. He took the worst team in the league, and built it into the top team in the league in just his second season. He's very passionate about the Marksmen and he shows it every single day, on and off the ice," said Norris "I couldn't be more proud or happier for him. He deserves this honor, and I'm ecstatic that our league saw it the same way. We are very fortunate to have him here, guiding our franchise to the top of the SPHL."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The 29-year-old from Sherwood Park, Alberta inherited a 12-win Marksmen team heading into the 2018-2019 season - his first year ever as a Head Coach - and quickly doubled the team's win total while clinching their first playoff spot. In his second season, with 10 less games played, he lead the Marksmen to 31 wins in 46 contests, and held them in a top two spot the entirety of the season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Joining Kallechy on the bench was a former student of his, Cory Melkert, who was named Assistant Coach over the Summer. Being a player and coach alongside Kallechy, Melkert could speak of the ability of the Head Coach as a leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "It was an honor to be able to coach alongside Jesse this year. Not knowing what to expect in my first year coaching, I couldn't have asked for a better mentor and friend. He cares just as much for his players as he does for anyone else, and that's a hard quality to find in a coach," said Melkert "Jesse takes his job very seriously and deserves every accolade he receives."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Kallechy is the fourth coach in franchise history to be named to the league's most prestigious honor for coaches; the first such Fayetteville coach awarded since 2013, and first for the Marksmen.

He has such a passion and professionalism for this organization and his position with the Marksmen," said Norris "Our entire Marksmen Family could not be happier for Jesse, and this award is a direct reflection of his dedication to our team."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Congratulations to Coach Kallechy on the well-deserved honor and the overdue moment in the spotlight. The future is bright for Fayetteville under their Coach of the Year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Leading the Marksmen from the basement to finishing this shortened-season tied for first, Head Coach Jesse Kallechy named league's Coach of the Year.

"We are nowhere near out of the woods. We're going to see some tough weeks ahead, but we are seeing encouraging signs that there could be a light at the end of the tunnel."

It comes as no surprise to anyone that Amazon's been having trouble keeping up with demand lately, but according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the retailer has been tweaking its website in an effort to reduce the number of items people are buying. Back in March, Amazon paused inbound shipments from 3rd-party sellers to its warehouses in an effort to focus on only essential items, but that doesn't appear that it's been a big enough change. The company is seeing increased orders across the board, and struggles to fulfill the deliveries and meet the demand.

After a 27% rally from its March lows, the S&P 500 index still stands 18% below its record high as first-quarter earnings kicked off with U.S. banks preparing for a wave of future loan defaults following a halt in business activity.

Whether this oh-so-good liquid is known as soda, Coke or pop in your neck of the woods, anyone would be hard-pressed to beat the 700 flavors an Oklahoma visitor would find at Pops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Route 66 travelers or those crossing Oklahoma on I-44: It is worth hitting the brakes and making your way to Pops. Yes, it is a gas station but, oh, it is so much more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Historic Route 66 travelers will recognize Pops by what is deemed to be the largest soda bottle in the world. Standing 66 feet tall, this steel hoop bottle has thousands of LED lights attached and changes colors. When walking up to the shop one can't miss the display of thousands of soda bottles arranged by color in the large glass front of Pops. There are brands one might be familiar with or never heard of. Root beer seems to be one of the best sellers, and it comes in about 80 varieties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               If you can think of a flavor you can probably find it here. Buy one or order a make-your-own case at the kiosk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               It is not a place where one pulls up to the pump, fills the car with gas and walks into this store/restaurant and says, "Coke, please." It takes a lot of time to decide a flavor that fits your day. A soda seeker could get frostbite standing in front of the cooler reading the flavors. It is more like, "Give me a Bawls Guaran Exotic Blue and a Corn Squeezin' Citrus," or "I'll have a Dragon Tail Blazin' Tropical, please." Just reading the flavors will make a traveler get behind on their itinerary by an hour or so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               If you decide to have a bite to eat while visiting this glorified gas station, it is even more difficult. It is an eat-in or take-out restaurant. Pops' burgers are served with a heaping load of Pops Fries. The Pops "Ripper" Dog and Chili Dog are deep-fried quarter-pound all-beef hot dogs. Pops also has an avocado turkey wrap, chicken melt and salads. They offer options of veggie burgers and gluten-free buns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After enjoying a meal, while still trying to decide a flavor of soda to take on the road, the subject of dessert might come up around the table. The old fashioned soda fountain is known for its milkshakes and floats, and Pops offers hand dipped ice cream, ice cream sandwich sundaes, root beer bread pudding, seasonal cobblers and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Pops also offers breakfast -- a signature omelet, buttermilk pancakes, waffles, French Texas toast, biscuits and gravy and, of course, the Mother Road Omelet with breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage, and French toast, pancakes or biscuits and gravy. Maybe breakfast is a great time to try the bacon flavored soda?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Pops opened as a convenience store, souvenir shop and restaurant in 2007. This soda pop stop is a great place for a rest from the road for those traveling in the Sooner State. Pops 66 Soda Ranch is north of Norman, right in the center of Oklahoma, at 660 W. Highway 66 in Arcadia.

They are the American Dairy Association North East, representing over 10,000 dairy farmers, and Dairy Farmers of America (DFA), a national cooperative owned by dairy farm families across the U.S.They have teamed up with Dean Foods processing plants across the Northeast to help deliver milk and dairy foods to Watertown.The groups say rising unemployment and school closures are putting added stress on America’s food pantries. As a result, food banks across the nation are being hit hard by complications of the coronavirus. ”Fortunately, dairy farmers have not experienced a disruption in milk production, and there is no shortage of milk,” said Rick Naczi, CEO, American Dairy Association North East, in a news release. “Milk is an essential item for nutritional wellbeing and meal preparation, especially for households with children. We’re doing everything we can to make sure families have access to milk.”“As a dairy cooperative owned by family farmers across the country, we are dedicated to helping provide nutritious food for family tables,” said Jennifer Huson, Senior Director Marketing, Council Affairs and Industry Relations for DFA Northeast. “Knowing that millions of Americans are struggling right now to make ends meet and with food banks being a critical local resource to help feed those families, we knew that we had to figure out a solution.Copyright 2020 WWNY.

Former Minerva superintendent Mike Gallina was set to be the master of ceremonies, and a family-style dinner was going to be provided by the local Amish community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Proceeds were to benefit local fire departments and EMS, including Sandy Creek Joint Fire District and EMS, Augusta Township Fire Department, and Fox Township Fire Department; Minerva Police Department; local military organizations, including the Military Family Center, Save 22, and the VFW; and the Minerva Rotary Club.

In total, West Virginians will receive $1.87 billion in these recovery rebates and while these one-time checks will be helpful, no provisions in the legislation promise more payments down the road. Should poor economic conditions continue, Congress may have to consider additional measures to help these families.

You might say it’s a bit morbid to find solace, as I do these days, in a graveyard, but walking amongst the 200,000-odd buried in this nearby plot of land, I feel at peace. Here, six feet under, are the remains of people who somehow managed to live out their trials and tribulations. There’s comfort in that.

After a calamitous run of form in 1997, former England keeper David James blamed his error-strewn performances on playing Tekken II and Tomb Raider for hours on end.      Well, according to the game’s international governing body, James has erred again. FIFA – the real FIFA – carried out a survey of over 10,000 gamers and 58 per cent stated the virtual skills they’d learned on the video game FIFA improved their game on the pitch, citing silkier skills and improved awareness.      The link between furiously twiddling your controller and pulling the strings for your team in real life is a growing one. Research by London’s Queen Mary University suggests some video games actually increase brainpower.      The study found that subjects who played the military strategy game StarCraft improved their decision-making, as well as creative and lateral thinking.      “The current work also revealed that real-time strategy games can promote our ability to think on the fly and learn from past mistakes,” explains Dr Brian Glass, head of the research.      That means playing a cerebrally-stretching game on your Xbox or PlayStation can lead to choosing the right pass, knowing when to make that run in behind, or timing a risky tackle in the penalty box.      Now you have a legitimate excuse for swerving a wet Tuesday night training session: tell the gaffer it’s all in the thumbs.       _BE A PLAYSTATION PLAYER!

The Colombian defender has struggled to earn a place in Filippo Inzaghi's side, having dropped down the pecking order at San Siro.
 However, he returned against Inter on Sunday as Milan earned a point from a 1-1 draw against their city rivals, and he is now hoping that is the start of a long run in the team.
 "I hope to become a first-team regular again soon," he told _Gazzetta dello Sport_. "Because it's hard to find form without continuity.
 "The back-line has hardly ever been the same and when you frequently change the players, it's hard to find a balance.
 "I myself know that I have had some negative displays. Against Palermo for instance it all went wrong (Milan lost 2-0 and Zapata scored an own goal).
 "I know that I still have a lot to prove, but I have no doubts over my qualities."
 Milan face Udinese in the league this weekend looking to end a five-game winless Serie A run, something Zapata says is crucial if they are to reach their goals this season.
 "We have to start winning right away," he added. "As only by winning will we get back into the Champions League.
 "The derby was a missed opportunity. Not obtaining a result for Milan means lots of pressure is heaped upon us."

The president baited the press, and they gobbled it up. Meanwhile, serious debate continues in television newsrooms about whether to carry the briefings live. Having spent the first years of my career in ABC’s New York newsroom I can state with certainty that there is no more difficult decision than whether to grant airtime to a president — and when to pull the plug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Maybe in the multi-platform age there is no reason for so many outlets to carry the briefings. Yet, if I were a news executive I would opt to carry all of it during a national emergency — but not if it contains blatant campaign videos. And, as a viewer, I want to watch all of it, even as the sparring between the president and press becomes almost insufferable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The sad irony here is that the administration and state governors from both parties — along with many business leaders — have succeeded, for the most part, in putting differences aside for the good of the nation. Why can’t the president do the same in dealing with the White House press corps?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At one point in Monday’s briefing the president said to Paula Reid of CBS: “Right now, nearly 20 million people are unemployed, and tens of thousands of Americans are dead. How is this. . . supposed to make people feel confident in an unprecedented crisis?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Exactly, Mister President. Start repairing and refocusing these briefings.

"As much as we talk about how much we want the big fights back, there is a world of four-round and six-round fighters who are the B-sides and they either supplement or, in some cases, make their entire income through fighting off TV shows and on walk-out and undercard bouts," Jay said. "We want to do something to help these guys. We know situations of guys who are flat-out unemployed."
 Jay works for Contenders Clothing and has helped the company outfit a number of fighters -- from undercard newcomers to heavyweight champion Tyson Fury -- with their themed t-shirts, hats and boxer briefs which includes licensing deals with Muhammad Ali and both the "Rocky" and "Karate Kid" movie franchises.
 Contenders is giving 10% of its April sales to a fund to help support pro fighters of all kinds. Boxers can sign up on the company's website. In addition, Contenders has created an exclusive "Going the Social Distance" fundraiser t-shirt in which all sales will go into the fund.
 "We put our heads together and came up with an idea of a fund for fighters with no strings attached or red tape," Jay said. "We don't care how big you are or what your record is. As long as you are an active pro you can sign up and we are going to split the pot and send money out to every single person. We don't know the reach this is going to have and this is not a savior check but if we can pay somebody's electrical bill next month through this or the family gets groceries for a week, we want to do that. Nobody is looking out for these guys."

"There are recurring themes of missed warning signals, failure to share information, and a general lack of appreciation for the risks involved," the presidential commission said in its report. "Though it is tempting to single out one crucial misstep or point the finger at one bad actor as the cause of the Deepwater Horizon explosion, any such explanation provides a dangerously incomplete picture of what happened."

Predictions of when recognizable sports could resume have been all over the map. Dr. Anthony Fauci said this week that he sees no reason why Major League Baseball and college and professional soccer can't play (minus fans) in late summer. Other medical experts and government officials have been much more cautious, saying that even gathering a small number of players, coaches, and support personnel runs the risk of spreading the coronavirus.

Mackay has been out of work since being dismissed by Cardiff City last December after a fall out with the Welsh club's owner Vincent Tan.
 The 42-year-old Scot was on the verge of taking over at Crystal Palace in August before he was reported to the Football Association over text messages he exchanged with then Cardiff head of recruitment Iain Moody, which he admitted were "disrespectful of other cultures".
 Wigan have now given Mackay an opportunity to resume his managerial career as successor to Rosler, who paid the price for a poor start to the season when he was relieved of his duties last week.
 The Lancashire club's chairman Dave Whelan is backing the former Scotland international to take Wigan back into the Premier League, having achieved that feat with Cardiff.
 "He is the man to lead us back into the Premier League, I am convinced of that having met him and discussed the demands of the job ahead of him," Whelan told Wigan's official website.
 "He has led a team out of the Championship before and he knows this league inside out having played and managed in it."
 Whelan is aware that Mackay's appointment could be viewed as controversial, but believes he deserves another chance.
 "I know that this appointment will draw criticism in some quarters but we go into it with our eyes open and we have nothing to hide on this subject." he added.      "Malky made a mistake, he knows that, we know that and we have discussed this issue at length face to face. He apologised publicly for what happened at the time and has paid for what he did in terms of the bad publicity he has received since and will no doubt continue to suffer in the future."
 Wigan are languishing in the relegation zone ahead of their clash with high- flying Middlesbrough on Saturday.

During this difficult time of online distance learning, a group of Boynton Beach teachers are reminding students how much they're loved."We wanted them to know that we were here and that we miss them," said Jenn Karvaski, a fourth grade teacher at Freedom Shores Elementary Schools.Teachers at the school made a special video for students, sending them uplifting messages to share their love and inspire children beyond their daily Google Classroom lessons."I don’t think any of us thought when the announcement was made that they were closing schools that it was going to be this," said Karvaski.In this time of uncertainty, Karvaski said what she's looking forward to the most is seeing her students every morning, even if it's on a computer screen."That's how we are making our connections with them," said Karvaski. "Honestly, it was their favorite part of the day in school."It's not easy for Karvaski, who's the mother of a third and seventh grader who also need help with remote learning."We are putting in very long hours which I don’t think any of us expected going into this, and I feel like there are some days that my kids get me more than others," said Karvaski.Kimberly Rogers, the assistant principal at Freedom Shores Elementary Schools, knows the feeling since she has a kindergartener at home."It's been a long time that I've been out of the classroom," said Rogers. "I've always had such appreciation for teachers, obviously. But, I mean, he is giving me a run for my money."Karvaski never expected to be away from her classroom for this long."Some of the teachers, we went in to pick up materials that we would need to teach from home, and most of us were crying to see our classrooms empty, beautifully cleaned, but to know that we probably wouldn’t be back there with the same kids," said Karvaski.Making the best of a difficult situation, we can all agree these teachers are essential, and very special."I know how much they need us right now," said Karvaski. "We all need each other right now."Scripps Only Content 2020

Less than a month after the launch of its flagship P40 series, Huawei is gearing up to launch its affordable flagship lineup in China. The Chinese tech giant recently uploaded a post on its Weibo account, confirming the launch date of the Nova 7 series.
 Huawei is preparing to launch several new Nova phones on April 23. The latest editions to the Huawei Nova series will likely include the Nova 7, Nova 7 SE and Nova 7 Pro. Huawei Weibo post reveals a silhouette of a smartphone, but it is unclear which Nova 7 phone the company is showcasing in the poster.
 The silhouette reveals a rectangular camera bump on the back of the phone, similar to a previous image leaked by Weibo user Technology Yu. All three Huawei Nova 7 smartphones are expected to offer 5G connectivity and arrive with different chipsets. The Huawei Nova 7 and Nova 7 Pro are expected to use the Kirin 985 and Kirin 990 5G chipsets, respectively, while the Nova 7 SE will likely use a Kirin 820 SoC.

But for about 20 minutes at the end of the day, all of this drops away. We listen to the sisters chant  _Salve Regina_  or to the monks at Plum Village chant the Namo Avalokiteshvara accompanied by violin and prayer bowl. It does not matter if we sit in our small living room. It could be the dining room, the kitchen, or even the bathroom. It’s not about the room. The music. Or even the candles, really. It’s about making ourselves still in the face of uncertainty. It’s about closing our eyes and opening ourselves to the flickering moment and all that actually surrounds us—the good, the bad, the unknown. It’s about sifting it through the net of our undivided attention, and honing our sense of what’s beautiful and true and lasting in this world.

Some of the more exciting changes come with the new Envy x360 13 and Envy x360 15 laptops. Of course, the biggest difference between these models and the standard Envy is their two-in-one functionality. Each laptop can be fully folded into a tablet-like device, or you can arrange it to look like a tent, making watching movies more enjoyable. Both start at $ 699.99 and ship with AMD's 7nm Zen 2 series processor CPUs. The 13-inch model has 8GB of RAM, a fast 512GB NVMe SSD, and AMD's Ryzen 7 4700U. To achieve the same starting price, the 15-inch machine has been equipped with half of that storage and AMD's slower Ryzen 4500U processor. I doubt the difference in performance between the two is night and day, but it's worth considering whether size or power is more important to you.

"I think there are glimmers of hope that the physical distancing measures that were put in place in the middle of March are starting to bear fruit. That is not, however, a license to let up, and we really need people to stay home (and) to only emerge for essential reasons (like) exercise, groceries, pharmacies or to seek medical attention," he added.

The latter came about, she says, because “summer after summer, ITV got hammered by Channel 4’s Big Brother". Fascinated by the way celebrities all date each other, she dreamed up a scenario that would parachute Z-listers onto an island in Fiji. Patrick Kielty and Kelly Brook, one time “paramour” of George Clooney, hosted. Abby Titmus, whose claim to fame was equally tenuous, was one of the first contestants. “It was a very, very slow burn. But eventually it beat Big Brother every night it was on.”

But it’s going through all of the stories of NHS workers that has really struck a chord with Sarah. “Some of the entries we’re getting through are very moving – and it’s so good to think that this will make a difference. A nurse that won one of the first holidays was interviewed and she was in tears. To see what people are going through, and that we’re helping is just so rewarding. I’ve been told that we’re offering a light at the end of the tunnel during a dark time. And to see that light spreading across the country – you just couldn’t ask for more.”

With the Draft still a month away, at least as things stand with the COVID-19 outbreak right now, Miami’s needs have become clearer. Quarterback was always and still is the top priority for the Draft. Running Back is a need still, and there’s a plethora of top notch backs in this year’s class. Offensive Line, obviously. Miami can use help across the board there. With the defensive free agent signings, I’m not sure edge defenders are a need anymore, but I think Miami will still bargain shop there. Safety, specifically free safety, and a true nose tackle round out the needs list. At lest in my mind.
