One such moment when Ariel went for a more modern look was at the premiere of her film  _Dog Years_. The then 19-year-old was dazzling in a sequined mini- dress she wore on April 22, 2017 to the Tribeca Film Festival debut of the movie. The intricate detailing throughout the ensemble glistened, as the halter dress fit her body perfectly and accentuated her figure to a tee. With the hem hitting a number of inches above her knees, Ariel paired the dress with a pair of pointed toe black heels. As the centerpiece of her look, Ariel opted to go for minimal accessories, simply adding a pair of stud earrings. Her long, raven black hair was worn down her back and Ariel's makeup brought out her best features.

AUtotransfusion system is highly relied upon for its ability to direct maximum blood back into the patient’s system with highest volume of red blood cells. The process therefore significantly eliminated the need for foreign donor which bears high risks of infections. Growing number of cardiac surgical procedures on the back of surged cardiac disorders is likely to favor greater adoption and growth in global autotransfusion system market.

The world was in collective shock on Sunday, Jan. 26 upon hearing the news that NBA legend Kobe Bryant had died as a result of a helicopter crash. Kobe's daughter, Gianna, a rising basketball star in her own right, was also on board the helicopter at the time of the crash and died as a result. Now, shortly after the tragic news, a clip of Kobe on _Jimmy Kimmel Live_ has resurfaced in which he explains that Gianna was ready to carry on his legacy.


  During his appearance on the late-night talk show program in October 2018, Kobe discussed how he was coaching his daughter's basketball team. When host Jimmy Kimmel asked if Gianna had aspirations to play in the WNBA, the Laker replied that "she does, for sure." As the athlete went on to explain, his daughter was vocal about being the one to carry on his legacy, despite fans who said that Kobe needed to have a son to "carry on the tradition."

JWoww and Mathews split in September 2018 after about three years of marriage. Following the news of their break-up, the couple found themselves in the midst of a bit of relationship drama, according to _Us Weekly_. In December, Mathews posted a series of Instagram videos in which he claimed that his ex was "hysterically shouting" and that she threatened to call the police on him after a fight.
 On _Jersey Shore Family Vacation_ , JWoww explained that she didn't want to talk about her split or her relationship issues publicly.
 "I didn't want to talk about it publicly, out of respect for my children," she said in an August 2019 episode of the show, per _Us Weekly_. "So when those videos came out, I feel like it was a really, really low blow by Roger."
 "I thought silence was the greater good," JWoww continued to tell her friend and co-star, Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi on the show.
 "It is, for your kids," Polizzi responded. "And who wants this s- out in the public, anyway? I guess he does."

 "As bad as our relationship got, I stayed f-ing quiet, because that's what you're supposed to do," JWoww replied. "So to me, the ultimate betrayal is the fact that he went public."
 JWoww and Mathews' divorce was finalized in August 2019. Like her ex, the ___Jersey Shore_ star has also moved on after the split. She has been in an on and off relationship with Zack Clayton since March 2019.

In 1798, the Marine Corps was reestablished to help combat pirates of the Barbary Coast who were attacking U.S. merchant ships in the Mediterranean region. In those early years, the Marines acted as “naval infantry,” working aboard Navy ships and going ashore or onto enemy ships to fight when necessary. They also served as a security and police force on Navy ships. At the time, many Navy sailors were non-professionals who had been conscripted into service. The possibility of mutiny was very real. The Marines on board were often positioned in between the crew quarters and the officers. While at sea, the Marines were under the command of the Navy. When they went ashore, they were under Army command.

Although the Marine Corps is separate from the Navy, the two forces both operate under the Department of the Navy and have a close relationship. Marine forces often provide security on Navy ships, and many Navy ships have Marine units stationed on them (including an air wing) on a semi-permanent basis. Certain “behind the scenes” jobs, such as chaplains or medics, are filled in the Marine Corps ranks by Navy personnel because the Marines don’t train those positions. These personnel wear Marine uniforms with Navy insignias. Marine officers are trained at the Naval Academy, and Navy officer training includes some training by a Marine Corps drill instructor.

HONOLULU (AP) — Scientists will decide whether to establish a captive breeding program on the U.S. mainland in an attempt to prevent the extinction of a bird species only found on Maui, officials said. A decision about the plan to save the endangered kiwikiu is expected at a meeting of project partners Thursday, The Hawaii Star-Advertiser reported Monday. A nonprofit bird facility on the mainland has expressed interest in a kiwikiu captive-breeding program, officials said. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv­ice, one of the project partners, did not immediately respond to a request for information. Also known as the Maui parrotbill, the population of yellow and olive-green forest birds has dwindled to fewer than 300. The Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project halted a program to establish a population on the windward slopes of Maui’s Haleakala volcano after mosquito-borne avian malaria killed 10 of 13 birds set to be released in October, including one that died before it was set free. The final three are missing and presumed dead. Recovery project officials hope the program on the mainland will buy time for the Maui parrotbill. Scientists said they need to find new ways to deal with the growing number of mosquitoes moving higher in forest elevation as Hawaii’s climate grows warmer. “We have only a small window to do anything,” Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project Coordinator Hanna Mounce said. The kiwikiu has suffered over the last century from habitat loss, invasive species, disease. and predators. Once found throughout low and highland forests of Maui and Molokai, the species has been relegated to the higher elevations of windward Haleakala, officials said. The bird’s range continues to shrink as climate change accelerates and mosquitoes carrying avian malaria...

Iranian forces recently admitted to ‘unintentionally’ shooting down a Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran, killing all 179 passengers. But still, few are aware of the exact location of the aircraft's black box, causing fresh concern. Canadian President Justin Trudeau has promised ‘justice’ for the victim’s families, insisting the black box be sent to France, making the case that Iran lacks the technology to carry out its own thorough investigation. 57 Canadian citizens were on board the doomed flight en route to Dubai. On Monday, Iran made it clear its intentions to send the black box to Ukraine for further analysis, the head of the crash investigation probe told reporters the next day that all recordings would be examined in Iran, and by Iranian officials. According to Hassan Rezaifar, director of accident investigations at Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation, Iran were seeking “to read the (flight data recorder) in Kiev".

Hafeez, 39, who made a brilliant 67 not out in the second T20 international against Bangladesh on Sunday said he was happy to be recalled to the Pakistan team after being sidelined since the World Cup.


  “It was good to come back and get runs and it just pumped up my confidence even more that I can still add value to the team,” he said.


  Another former captain and senior player, Shoaib Malik was also recalled for the Bangladesh series after being ignored since the last World Cup in England.


  Malik also scored a half-century in the first T20 match in Lahore to give Pakistan a hard-fought win.


  Hafeez, who is also due to appear for a bowling assessment test at the LUMs university biomechanic lab on Wednesday in a bid to have his bowling action cleared said, he was confident he would come through.


  “I would like to contribute as a batsman and bowler to the Pakistan team and I am very confident I will clear the test because I don’t see any major problems in my bowling action.”


  Hafeez was stopped from bowling while playing in UK’s T20 blast last year after officials reported his bowling action as illegal.


  Hafeez said it was great to be playing back in Pakistan.


  “For ten years we played our Test and other matches in UAE or other places and it is good we have returned to Pakistan and can play in front of our home crowds.”


  But he felt that quality of pitches for home international matches need to get better, noting that tracks for the T20 series against Bangladesh were below par.


  After Pakistan won the first two matches, the third was washed out due to rain on Monday.


  Bangladesh will return to Pakistan next month for a Test match in Rawalpindi.

Cuando hablamos de _fundraising_ hablamos de un medio que permite la sostenibilidad de una Entidad No Lucrativa (ENL) y la movilización de recursos para una finalidad de interés general. Si queremos que la sociedad reconozca la cultura como algo importante y esencial, tenemos que acercar la cultura a la calle, conectar con la gente y el _fundraising_ permite ese contacto a través de la colaboración individual de muchas personas. _Fundraising_ no es, exclusivamente, la aportación de 4/5 grandes donantes, ya sean personas físicas o jurídicas, sino la construcción de una comunidad, de una base social que aporte de legitimación, además, por supuesto, que sostenibilidad económica a medio-largo plazo.

"The best thing that happens is when we go out, and fans come up to me, she'll be standing next to me and they'll be like, 'You gotta have a boy. You and [Vanessa] gotta have a boy. Gotta have someone carry on the tradition,'" Kobe told Kimmel. "She's like, 'Oy, I got this! You don't need no boy for that, I got this.'"


  "That's right. Yes you do," Kobe said about his daughter, beaming with pride as he did so. This video serves as a sorrowful reminder that Kobe and Gianna are no longer around to see the teenager ultimately carry on her dad's legacy. However, it's more than clear that neither Kobe nor Gianna's legacies will be forgotten anytime soon. Following the news of Kobe and Gianna's deaths, numerous individuals have spoken out about the tragedy.


  Kobe's dear friend, and his former teammate on the Lakers, Shaquille O'Neal, released a statement about the loss of his "brother" and his "niece."
