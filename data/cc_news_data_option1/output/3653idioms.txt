CICC’s first mega-mandate involved the restructuring and IPO of China Mobile, which raised $4.2 billion in 1997 by selling shares to investors in Hong Kong and New York. That marked the first government-sponsored privatization of a big state vehicle, but it was arguably Levin’s arrival a year later that sparked CICC’s vertiginous rise. He became the public face of the investment house, helping it become the go-to underwriter for any SOEs keen to go public.

Relax. This is not a column on the efficacy of wearing masks. Who has the energy anymore?
 I’m wearing one in case it prevents me or someone else from getting sick. That’s pretty much it. If it turns out that it didn’t do any good, so be it. Unless my fogged up glasses cause me to misstep and fall down a mineshaft, I will have lost nothing.
 I’m more interested in the implications of the acceptance of mask wearing in public places as a cultural norm.
 I confess – sometimes I forget. In my 56 years on Earth, I’ve never worn a mask in public. Now, I’m getting used to wearing a mask everywhere I go.
 It’s not a seamless transition. Thus, I’ve had to endure some sideways glances from pious neighbors and fellow shoppers who act as if I’ve just given Winnie the Pooh a wedgie.
 It’s not easy to find a mask that fits my head. The elastic straps pull on my ears, so I look like a house-elf. I’ve tried the kind that tie in the back of my head but that seems like work. I finally settled on a black one with straps that would fit a hippo.
 On the campus where I teach, virtually everyone is wearing a mask. I have a difficult time hearing students in class and the larger the room, the worse it is. The bigger problem is I can’t see faces. Wearing a mask obscures the features. I don’t like it. It’s as if we’re all partially anonymous, isolated, hiding in plain sight. There’s a reason why outlaws wore masks when they robbed the stagecoach.
 “But, if it saves lives,” the refrain goes. Who am I to argue?
 I am a little confused by the general lack of consistency. I was so desperate to watch a football game on Saturday I landed on Army vs. Middle Tennessee State. I have no affiliation whatsoever with either program. I did notice the coaches were all wearing masks on the sidelines. The players, of course, were not.
 In our school district in Kentucky, high school football practice continues unabated. But school itself remains closed. Classes are online-only until at least Oct. 12.
 I’m not picking on football. I love football. I’m just wondering why we’re playing football if our kids haven’t been in school since March.
 I’ve been around enough teenagers in my life to know that online education is no substitute for in-person learning, though I wish I had purchased a few shares of Zoom stock last year. Of course, I hadn’t heard of Zoom before March so I was a little behind the curve.
 Kids, teenagers in particular, need to get their rear ends out of bed, take a shower, put on clothes, show up on time and pay attention. It’s about developing good work habits.
 In high school, I had a history teacher who told us, “You might not remember much American history but, by jiminy, you’re going to learn how to be on time.”
 He was right on both counts. I don’t remember much of what he taught but I can still see him, standing outside the door of the classroom, audibly counting down the seconds before the start of class.
 I realize online learning has a place. It’s a valuable tool. But there is a perceived lack of accountability baked into remote instruction.
 I can’t tell you how many students during my Zoom sessions last spring awoke minutes before the beginning of class and “attended” the session supine, under a blanket, if they awoke at all. It’s difficult to engage in the middle of a REM cycle. I had one student who stayed on screen well after class ended, though he had turned off his camera.
 I stayed on too because I wanted to see if he had a question. Then I heard something that sounded like a lawn mower in the distance. He was snoring. I wanted to believe his snooze had nothing to do with my lecture but I allowed for the possibility. It wouldn’t have been the first time. I didn’t have the heart to wake him.
 I’d like to believe we’ll return to a time when masks, social distancing and distance learning will no longer be a requirement. If a student wants to sleep in class, then he can do it in person, just like I did.

Taiwan has mostly achieved its economic success on its own, lacking the international input other nations might normally draw from. At Beijing’s insistence, Taiwan is diplomatically excluded from much of the critical international discourse or bonds forged between nations. China forbids dual diplomatic recognition, so the Republic of China is recognized by an ever- dwindling list of just 17 countries, soon to be 16 if Beijing’s renewed efforts to woo the Solomon Islands bear fruit.

Hong Kong -- China's TV regulators have chosen South   African-based pay TV operator MIH Holdings Ltd. to help the country build a national   direct-to-home system in the face of competing tenders from other satellite-TV companies,   Chinese government sources said.
 MIH was one of nine foreign companies invited in July to   provide business plans for building a national DTH system to bring state-run China Central   Television's (CCTV) eight channels to rural areas where it cannot currently be seen   \-- about 45 million households.
 Loral Space and Communications Ltd., Hughes Electronics   Corp., General Instrument Corp. and News Corp.'s NDS technology subsidiary were among   other companies in the running, according to sources.
 Although no official announcement has been made, sources   said MIH's victory was based on a plan to offer substantial discounts on the $100   million capital cost of setting up the system. In exchange, China will allow MIH to take a   small percentage of revenues.
 None of the companies involved was available to comment on   the result of the tender process.
 It remains unclear if the system will be expanded to   include more of China's estimated 280 million TV households after it begins   operations, probably in 2000. And there were conflicting reports about how many channels   the DTH platform will carry, if any, in addition to the CCTV slate.
 Channels produced by China's 15 provincial TV stations   \-- some of which produce as many as four -- would likely take up any additional capacity.   Foreign channels are prohibited from broadcasting on a 24-hour-per-day basis to facilities   other than government buildings, high-end hotels and housing compounds for foreigners.
 China's TV regulator, the State Administration of   Radio, Film and Television, is also tendering a satellite to carry the DTH system, but a   decision on which company will build the bird has not yet been reached.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri regulators have spent $1.3 million to defend themselves in court against a wave of lawsuits filed by businesses that were denied medical marijuana business licenses. Businesses that didn't receive permits from the state filed 853 appeals through the state's Administrative Hearing Commission, and 785 of those cases remained unresolved last week, said Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Senior Services, which runs the medical marijuana division. Cox told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the legal fees are a one-time cost associated with getting Missouri’s program up and running, but critics said it is a reflection of problems in the way permits were awarded. She said the state received 2,270 facility applications but only awarded 348 total licenses. “The number of appeals is not an indication of flaws in the process, but rather the high number of applicants,” Cox said. Lawyer Chuck Hatfield, who represents eight businesses that appealed after not getting state licenses, said the process to review applications for medical marijuana licenses appears flawed because companies received different scores for some of their answers on the form even though they were identical to what other companies submitted. “They answered verbatim the way other applicants answered, because a lot of the applicants shared common consultants on certain issues,” Hatfield said. “And so our answers are identical to the word, to the way other applicants answered, and yet we got a different score.” State lawmakers are in the middle of reviewing the medical marijuana permit application process, but that investigation has been on hold for several months because of the coronavirus pandemic. The money spent on legal bills comes from fees...

Philadelphia -- Harold F. (Gerry) Lenfest, president and   CEO of Lenfest Communications Corp., said last week that he and his wife, Marguerite, were   exonerated of all civil charges that they had violated federal insider-trading laws.
 Lenfest said a three-day trial here before U.S. District   Court Judge J. Curtis Joyner ended last Wednesday, with Joyner dismissing all charges   filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 In December 1995, the SEC filed a civil complaint in   federal court, alleging that the Lenfests engaged in insider trading before the October   1993 announcement of the proposed merger among Tele-Communications Inc., Liberty Media   Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp.
 The SEC claimed that Gerry Lenfest -- who, at the time, was   an outside director at Liberty -- had advance information about the announcement, which   drove up the value of TCI's and other cable stocks. The agency asserted that Lenfest   advised his son, H. Chase Lenfest, to buy TCI stock before the merger was publicly   announced.
 The SEC also alleged that Lenfest told Marguerite about the   merger plans, and that she asked their son to buy TCI stock for her, too.
 Even though the merger fell through, TCI's share price   rose sharply, providing Chase and Marguerite Lenfest with about $120,000 in paper profits,   the SEC said.
 "I am very pleased that the court agreed with my   belief that my family and I did nothing wrong," Gerry Lenfest said last week, in a   prepared statement. "I hold business ethics in high regard, and I hope that this   decision settles this matter once and for all."

 “It becomes very burdensome for us to do that so really at the end of the day, the easiest way for me to put out information to the public so you know what’s going on, is to give you a very sanitized version of what we do everyday,” Schmidt said.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi residents will vote on people and issues in the Nov. 3 general election. The ballot will list candidates for president, U.S. House and Senate and state Supreme Court. Three issues are on the ballot. One is the question of whether to legalize medical marijuana. Another is whether to eliminate an electoral college provision in races for governor and other statewide offices. The third is a yes-or-no vote on a single proposal for a new state flag. Because of the ballot structure, there's potential for confusion on the medical marijuana question. Initiative 65 would legalize medical marijuana. It is paired on the ballot with Alternative Measure 65A, which would legalize medical marijuana only for people with debilitating conditions. There's a two-step process for voting on 65 and 65A. The ballot first instructs people to “Vote for approval of either, or against both.” It then says, “And for vote for one” — either 65 or 65A. “Even if you vote against both, you can still vote for 65 or 65A just in case this was to pass,” Secretary of State Michael Watson said in a Facebook video. Responding to questions from The Associated Press, Watson said Friday that it's OK for people who vote against both 65 and 65A to skip the second part. Their “no” vote will still count. Initiative 65 got on the ballot because more than 100,000 registered voters petitioned to put it there. The alternative got on the ballot because legislators put it there, as state law allows. Putting an alternative on the same ballot is generally seen as a way for legislators to kill the original proposal. That happened in 2015, when legislators put an alternative on the ballot along with a school-funding proposal that got there through the petition process....

Denver -- LyncStar Integrated Communications LLC, which   offers cable to multiple-dwelling units via open-video systems, has applied for a   traditional cable franchise in Austin, Texas.
 Ordinarily, OVS operators are not obliged to obtain local   franchises, although they must comply with the same must-carry, retransmission-consent and   PEG-access (public, educational and government) requirements as incumbent cable operators.
 In this case, however, the Lakewood, Colo.-based SMATV   (satellite-master-antenna television) outfit needs a franchise to install cable plant on   the city's rights-of-way, which will allow it to connect its OVS system at the   562-unit Canyon Oaks Apartments to other nearby MDUs.
 "We have four more properties either under contract or   with which we have agreements in principle," said Jim Honiotes, LyncStar's vice   president of operations.
 City officials are expected to hold the second of three   required readings on LyncStar's proposed franchise this week.
 Under the proposed deal, LyncStar would be subject to the   same franchise requirements as the city's incumbent cable operator, Time Warner   Cable, and it would have to work out an agreement with Time Warner in order to deliver the   MSO's local-access programming.
 Industry officials reported that Time Warner has raised   objections to LyncStar's request for a local franchise.
 Neither Time Warner nor city officials returned calls for   comment.
 Theoretically, however, the MSO may object to sharing its   local-access programming, which cable operators increasingly view as a valuable weapon   against competitors.
 Honiotes said the pending Austin franchise does not require   LyncStar to serve the entire city. As it expands, however, LyncStar will have to build out   its system to reach consumers who request its service and who live a predetermined   distance from its network.
 Once its franchise is approved, the company hopes to have   its Austin system built within six weeks, Honiotes said.
 "After that, we'll expand to where the business   is," he added. "We expect to be building for years."
 LyncStar has a similar franchise request pending in   Houston, where its 20 properties served constitute its largest cluster.
 It has already secured a franchise in the west Texas   community of Midland and another in Little Rock, Ark.
 With OVS systems already up and running in 15 states,   serving some 15,000 customers, LyncStar recently received its third OVS license in   Colorado when the Federal Communications Commission approved its application to serve Fort   Collins, a college town north of Denver.
 The company also has OVS licenses to serve portions of   Denver and Aurora, Colo.
