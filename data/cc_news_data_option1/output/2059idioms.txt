SWANSEA - Two teachers at Case Junior High were recognized on Saturday as part of a surprise retirement parade, and the event offered a chance for colleagues and even former students to give them a proper sendoff.
 Joe Monteiro, an eighth-grade history teacher, and Jayne Cestodio, the media center secretary, were honored after their last days as educators were cut short to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both teachers had tremendous impact on their students, other faculty members, and the community, as evidenced by the dozens of cars that turned out to say goodbye.
 Cestodio, who ran the media center for 30 years, is a passionate teacher who took pride in developing her students academically, but in turning young boys and girls into young men and women, she said.
 "Seeing them grow from sixth grade to eighth grade always amazed me," she said. "They came to our school nervous, but very excited and then by the time they reached the eighth grade they were much more confident and mature."
 Every year, Cestodio would join her students in going on the Washington, D.C., field trip. She recalls these memories as some of her favorites as a teacher. "You would form a bond with the eight students that you were responsible for," Cestodio said. "For me they were 'my kids' for those couple of days."
 The retirement parade came as a big surprise to Cestodio, as she never would have expected an event honoring her, especially in a time of isolation and social distancing. However, Cestodio said she appreciated the event and its creativity. "Fortunately during this pandemic, people have started to take a step out of the box to try and honor or celebrate a special time in people's lives."
 The retirement parade provided some closure, Cestodio said, in a time where the closing of schools has altered the everyday interactions teachers have with their students. When asked about what made this event special for her, Cestodio commented, "After working with people for so many years it is nice when they reach out to you. It makes you feel special."
 When asked about the impact he's had on his students, Monteiro said, "You sometimes don't realize that at the time."
 Two years ago, Monteiro received the Teacher of the Year award at Case Junior High, an accomplishment that speaks volumes about his impact on students' academic and social lives.
 Monteiro was very grateful and appreciative of his wife, Susan Monteiro, and colleague Julie Silva for organizing the event. "My wife is amazing and how she put this together with Julie Silvia was totally unexpected and completely appreciated!"
 Monteiro had no idea it was being planned. "How she kept it a surprise was amazing and the turnout by my coworkers and past and present student was overwhelming ... stunned," he said.
 Just like Cestodio, Monteiro emphasized the idea of closure and how it was so important, especially because of the sudden end to this school year. "Closure is so important and it wasn't able to happen this year in a traditional setting. What happened today provided Jayne and myself with that experience," he said.
 "I spent my days, my years with these people who became my family," Cestodio added. " I was truly blessed to have made many lifelong friends while loving what I did every day."

"At a time when innovative and fresh leadership is needed, this highly structured experience will give young people the tools needed to manage campaigns and run for office themselves. My campaign, which has been unique in its push for voter education and outreach, will also be in a position to conduct unprecedented outreach — in multiple languages — and get thousands of voters signed up to vote by mail in light of COVID-19.

VK: Organizations must invest in digital end-to-end architecture to completely thrive in the modern world while completely future-proofing their enterprise. Companies need to upgrade their front end with a sound customer engagement platform. They can put a wrapper around their back-end platforms to start with, but they will eventually need a digital back-end platform for a truly efficient business model. Right now, in the midst of the pandemic, companies might want to start by focusing on digital origination systems and delivery systems that enable them to digitize the delivery of payments and documents. Getting the digital origination and engagement capabilities up and running quickly is absolutely critical. If companies don't have the front-end capabilities right now, they'll miss the boat dealing with the new demands of this pandemic. If they don't take steps to move off legacy systems and create truly digital organizations, they won't be able to succeed in the future.

While there’s little doubt that the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Plus is in the works, we’ve now seen the closest thing yet to official confirmation of that, as the phone has seemingly appeared on a Chinese certification database. Specifically, a phone with the model number SM-N9860 was spotted by MyFixGuide in the database of China’s 3C certification agency (an agency which the Galaxy Note 20 Plus would have to be certified by before it could be sold in China). While the phone isn’t…

In Texas, we value community. And right now, community looks a lot different than what we’re used to. No large weddings or birthday parties. No band or orchestra recitals or spring plays. No Little League or youth soccer. The Summer Olympics have been delayed for at least a year and professional sports are having to rethink their seasons while we rethink our daily lives. The list of cancellations and postponements is nearly endless.
 For now, it’s “see you online” as we make the sacrifice to stay home in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. While nothing is more important than the health of our communities, it doesn’t soften the feelings of disappointment, heartbreak and loss that come with the cancellation of the things we love.
 If you’re a fan, family member or student supporting or participating in high school sports or interscholastic activities, the disappointment runs deep and it strikes close to home. Months of expectation and intense training have been unproductive for hundreds of high school teams and students. The dream of scoring a decisive victory over an arch-rival or competing for a state championship has either been put on hold or permanently surrendered.
 It’s “wait ‘til next year” for freshmen, sophomores and juniors. But for most of the high school seniors who participate in a spring sport or activity, this is more than a lost season. It’s the end of an active sports, academic or music career.
 The senior first baseman who picked up his first bat when he was 5 years old will never have the opportunity to swing at an 82 mph fastball again. The actress who finally got a leading role in One Act Play will never set foot on a stage or perform with her castmates again. The young woman who was elected captain of her tennis team will never know how deep into the tournament her squad could have gone.
 But here’s what will happen, and it’s significant. That same first baseman has learned that baseball is about far more than trying to hit a ball with a stick; it’s about a group of young men from vastly different backgrounds coming together as a team. The actress has discovered that if a person has enough determination and perseverance, accomplishments once thought impossible can be achieved. And the captain of the tennis team will take the leadership skills she’s learned as a student-athlete and apply them to everything she does for the rest of her life.
 Their seasons — indeed, their athletic, academic and music careers — may be over, but the character those seniors have developed through their participation in education-based high school activities lives on. It will encourage, guide and positively influence communities here in Texas for the next generation and beyond.
 To the class of 2020, thank you for the contribution you have made to your team, your school and your community. Most importantly, thank you for the shared sacrifice you are making right now to keep your communities safe and healthy. It will not soon be forgotten.
 As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “Intelligence plus character — that is the goal of true education.”
 To those UIL students who graduate this spring, you may have lost your senior season but you are equipped with both intelligence and character to overcome this adversity and to guide you in all of your future endeavors. Best wishes for continued growth and success.

The head of NHS Orkney has written an open letter explaining why he left the islands for his mainland home "on a few occasions" during lockdown.
 Chief executive Iain Stewart said he had only travelled to his Black Isle home when his family needed him.
 The health board, he said, could not function without movement of staff on and off the island.
 But he offered a "sincere heartfelt apology" to the people of Orkney for any offence he has caused.
 Orkney Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur had previously criticised Mr Stewart's trips home, claiming they were "at best, inadvisable".
