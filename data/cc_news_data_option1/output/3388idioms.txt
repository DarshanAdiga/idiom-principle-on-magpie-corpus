Mail-in voting efforts would be problematic, Braun said, for states trying to set up the protocols in the two months before an election.
 “Now if states decide to do (mail-in voting) as preferred method down the road, it’s up to any particular state,” he said.
 Braun said while the U.S. Postal Service has made it clear that a surge in volume could be handled, he questioned whether the postal system would have the capacity for such an effort in a timely basis.
 He offered a suggestion that the postal service should explore an update to its business model.
 “The post office is something we all use, but it has a business model that has not been updated for some time,” Braun said. He suggested that with changes like the explosion in email, first- and second-class mail delivery methods should be explored along with better ways to augment the services with parcel delivery.

I was already wrestling with the fact that we were getting governments at different levels passing climate emergency motions, but they didn't really have the look and sound and feel of an emergency. For example, we had the federal Trudeau government introduce a climate emergency motion last year and the very next day they approved the Trans Mountain pipeline. Then along came COVID. And in contrast to our lackadaisical approach to climate, the government response on COVID looks and sounds and feels like an emergency. You get daily press briefings from senior officials and government ministers. You invoke states of emergencies. You ensure that things that need to get produced, get produced. And you spend the money that you have to spend. Across the board, we've seen governments basically say, ‘deficit, be damned.’ That's what we did in WWII. But that is notably not what we've been doing today in the face of the climate emergency.

Several advisories were canceled including a storm surge warning west of High Island; a tropical storm warning from San Luis Pass to High Island; and a hurricane watch from east of Intracoastal City to west of Morgan City, Louisiana .
 Laura was the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.
 More than 580,000 coastal residents were under orders to flee in the largest evacuation since the coronavirus pandemic began and many did, filling hotels and sleeping in cars since officials didn’t want to open mass shelters and worsen the spread of COVID-19. But in Cameron Parish, where Laura came ashore, officials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles. The result could be deadly since forecasters said the parish could be completely covered by ocean water.
 Laura hit the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.

Posted @withregram • @unicef Welcome to the world, Daisy Dove Bloom! We are honoured to introduce Goodwill Ambassadors @KatyPerry and @OrlandoBloom's new bundle of joy.⠀ ⠀ "We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter," Katy and Orlando told us.⠀ ⠀ "But we know we're the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was. Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every eleven seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. Since COVID-19 many more newborn lives are at risk because of the increased lack of access to water, soap, vaccines and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathize with struggling parents now more than ever.⠀ ⠀ "As UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors, we know UNICEF is there, on the ground, doing whatever it takes to make sure every expecting mother has access to a trained health worker and access to quality healthcare. In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB's arrival. By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your ♥️ can bloom with generosity.⠀ ⠀ Gratefully-⠀ ⠀ Katy & Orlando."⠀ ⠀ Please tap the link in our bio to support the most precious gift: a healthy child.

Anthony Carrington Hislop, 52, confronted Jack McAlindon and struck him with the torch, then hit the victim twice with the pole after he had already been knocked unconscious in June 2018.The victim has no memory of what happened and has suffered permanent hearing loss in his right ear, the WA District Court heard on Thursday.Hislop was found guilty of doing an act with intent to cause harm, causing the victim’s life or safety to be endangered. The jury clearly rejected Hislop’s claims of home invader’s defence, self- defence and defence of lawful justification, Judge Belinda Lonsdale said.“The law does not permit people to engage in unbridled acts of violence against people who have done the wrong thing,” she said.“People are entitled to expect, certainly, that trespassers will not come onto their properties in the dead of night.“However, the jury must have accepted that you were not frightened ... you told police that you were frightened of no man.” Judge Lonsdale acknowledged the victim had drunkenly fought with his fiance that night and had insisted on going back to a party.“He was being a nuisance and for inexplicable reasons had decided to turn power off,” she said.“You were entitled, I think, to be angry. You were entitled to remove him from your property. “But at the time you hit him, there was no reason to think that he was heading to your house or that he was a threat to your safety. “Your response was, on any objective view, way out of proportion to the potential threat.” Judge Lonsdale accepted Hislop had shown some remorse, but said general deterrence was also a significant sentencing factor to deter others from acts of vigilantism.Hislop will be eligible for parole after serving 18 months behind bars.

Look what the government has just done. They've just spent over $250 billion responding to the virus and economically it's fine. The Bank of Canada is buying up billions of dollars of government securities a week. And Canada's debt to GDP ratio is going to go up to about 50 per cent. But at the end of WWII, it was over 100 per cent. What the government basically showed us is what they could've done all along in response to climate change and poverty and homelessness. Now the cat's out of the bag. We've seen what's possible. Now, we're going to need a whole lot of government investment because the private sector and households aren't going to be able to lead us into an economic recovery from COVID. What form will that state investment take? Will it be bailouts for the old industries or will it catapult us into the new?

Make it one and the same. Make the response to coronavirus and the climate emergency the biggest, baddest, boldest job creation plan we've seen since the war.

The Indian Institute of Technology Madras is coordinating a national effort to create crash courses for rural students that will be telecast on educational channels from Friday, August 28.
 Around 300 hours of video lectures have been created by faculty from various central universities and will be telecast on NPTEL channel 11-18 till August 31. The schedule of the telecast will be available on DTH Swayam Prabha at https://www.swayamprabha.gov.in/
 The project was initiated by B.S. Balaji, assistant professor, School of Biotechnology, Jawaharlal Nehru University and supported by K. Mangala Sunder, head, Department of Chemistry at IIT Madras, who is also the chief coordinator of DTH Swayam Prabha.
 With innovative teaching methodology that incorporates standardised protocols, the faculty has created lectures that places emphasis on conceptual understanding, problem solving approaches and case studies, apart from examples that have been worked out the officials said.
 Lectures that last around 40-50 hours for a course have been condensed to 10-15 hours. They were created to meet the high academic standards that the University Grants Commission and other academic bodies set, besides conforming to the technical requirements of high definition broadcast, they added.
 Swayam Prabha is a group of 32 DTH channels that telecast educational programmes round the clock. The content is repeated several times during the day to enable students to choose a time of their convenience. The content is provided by NPTEL, IITs, UGC, CEC, IGNOU, NCERT and NIOS.
