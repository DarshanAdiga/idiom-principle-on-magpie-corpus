Following the lead of its Planning Commission, Faribault’s City Council is revisiting an ordinance designed to ensure historically appropriate signage but that’s inflicted significant costs on some downtown business owners.
 Currently, the HPC reviews sign regulations in the Downtown Sign District. While it mostly overlaps with the current Historic Preservation District, the boundaries for the Sign District, first created in 1999, aren’t identical. Both boundaries are notorious for zig-zagging, and include some buildings but not others on the same block. Councilor Royal Ross called for the zone to be dramatically simplified, with four basically straight boundaries.
 Ross’s plan would not move the sign district boundaries to match the Historic Preservation District boundaries. Currently, the city is in the process of adding a large swath of downtown to the National Register of Historic Places, providing another definition of “downtown.”
 Potentially simplifying those boundaries was just one of three sign ordinance- related items discussed at Tuesday’ council work session. The second issue, and the most controversial, was how exactly downtown signs should be designed. Currently, downtown signs are required to include raised or recessed letters and a raised border. According to city staff, this requirement was intended to avoid homemade signs. In addition, such signs have long been a stylistic staple downtown.
 Ross, who once owned his own sign making company, said that this restriction dramatically increases costs for business owners. He said that a much more cost-efficient way to go about it would be to allow business owners to put up flat signs with a raised border.
 That idea is in line with the Heritage Preservation Commission’s recommendation, though not initial city staff recommendations. Councilor Janna Viscomi, among others, worried that allowing wholly painted signs downtown could have undesirable effects.
 “That’s what we don’t want to see — more plywood (downtown),” she said with a laugh.
 More controversial is a proposal to take away sign review powers from the HPC. Currently, all applicants in the downtown district must be granted a certificate of appropriateness by the HPC, but under the proposed new ordinance, that would no longer be necessary.
 Both the HPC and Planning Commission will review the proposal before sending it back to council, and it’s unclear whether they will look on that idea favorably. HPC member Ron Dwyer says he thinks the HPC has an important role to play in reviewing signs.
 “Governing the style of signs and keeping them consistent with the architecture in the district is a good idea,” Dwyer said. “If we can do that through the HPC, then that’s the place it should be done.”
 At last week’s meeting, HPC Member Karl Vohs suggested the HPC would be “relieved” to no longer need to grant the certificates of appropriateness. However, HPC staff liaison Kim Clausen clarified that Vohs was only speaking for himself, not the HPC as a whole.
 According to Clausen, the topic will likely be discussed at the HPC’s next regularly scheduled meeting. The Planning Commission is likely to discuss it soon as well, setting the stage for a proposed ordinance to come back to the council for approval.
 When it comes to the HPC’s role in the sign ordinance, Sam Temple came down more in the middle. The HPC and Planning Commission member clarified that he isn’t strongly opposed to the HPC continuing to serve in its current role of sign review, he suggested that its time might be better spent elsewhere.
 “Each commission has a limited amount of time and mental energy,” Temple said. “If the HPC were to no longer do the sign ordinance, I would be optimistic that we could fill that (time) with something that is very productive.”

This year, Biden’s team sees those same groups as less up for grabs. Many remain firmly with Trump, they reason, while others already have bailed on him and won’t be wooed back by another list of potential justices for a vacancy that doesn’t yet exist.

“I thought that the fourth set we were not communicating very well,” May said. “We seemed to have gotten quiet and lost our momentum until the end of the set.”
 The Lady ’Horns won the fifth set handily, 15-9, and at one point were up 9-2 in the final frame.
 “It was good to see they could play against a bigger school,” Scolari said.
 There’s always more work to be done, and Scolari said her players are motivated to keep getting better – and the biggest area they need to improve is talking to each other.
 “Our biggest issue right now is they’re all pretty quiet on the floor,” Scolari said. “We just need a couple of kids to step in and start being vocal court leaders, and I think that’s going to make a huge difference.”
 Though still early in the season, Scolari thinks that with continued improvement, the Lady ’Horns will make it to the state tournament.
 “The more we play and keep emphasizing the things we’re doing wrong, they are motivated to keep getting better,” she said. “As long as they have that mentality of, ‘We need to get better, we can get better,’ I think we have a great shot at it.”
 Meeteetse plays three matches this weekend. First up is Wind River (0-2) on Friday at 2 p.m., followed by a conference match-up against Burlington (0-4) at 5 p.m. On Saturday, the Lady ’Horns play Ten Sleep (no results posted) in another conference match at 4 p.m.

No. Actually, it's being fairly reasonable to say, we have a few cases, but no, I would say less than a handful of cases that we monitor closely, although we always put -- we have our risk management assessment where we take a look at the supply base health overall, and we monitor a lot of those suppliers. But in terms of any supply chain disruptions, we haven't seen anything that has been material for us in the last quarter. So actually, a good rebound from Q2 where most of companies were closed and there were shutdowns and really not operating and supporting production.
