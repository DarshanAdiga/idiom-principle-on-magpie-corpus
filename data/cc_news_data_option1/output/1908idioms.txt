With headlines of meat shortages strewn throughout the news, many Americans have started to adapt by changing their diets. In many cases, this means eating more seafood, and there is hope that even more Americans will hop on board and follow this trend. The Seafood Nutrition Partnership has created a campaign to “encourage Americans to eat seafood and buy seafood to support their personal health and for the economic health of the men and women working in our U.S. seafood economy.” This rapid-response consumer-facing campaign is a part of the Seafood4health Action Coalition with over 35 organizations involved.

OGDEN — It's not everyday you get attention from "Good Morning America."
 Or the "Today" show. Or Elle magazine.
 But after her 16-day stint helping an overwhelmed New York-area hospital contend with coronavirus patients, and after getting a shout out from pop star Taylor Swift, McKay-Dee Hospital nurse Whitney Hilton got coverage from all those outlets and more.
 "It was exciting at first, then it was kind of scary," she said, noting that her experience even made its way to media outlets in Russia, China and Africa. "I thought, wow, it's incredible just how fast news can spread."
 The hoopla started after Hilton's return to Utah with numerous other Intermountain Healthcare workers who had also helped at several New York-area hospitals. Hilton, who lives in Farmington, helped out at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, just outside Queens. She was there April 14-30.
 Hilton turned 30 soon after getting back to Utah, and friends and family, wanting to give her a splashy return, had reached out to Swift to see if they could get the star to take part in the festivities. Ultimately, Swift sent along a box of swag for Hilton — T-shirts, hoodies and more — as well as a personal message.
 "It says, 'I wanted to send you some presents and let you know I'm so grateful for you. I can't thank you enough for risking your life to help people and for spreading the message loudly about taking this seriously,'" Hilton said. Hilton made regular social media posts about her experience while in New York, emphasizing the danger posed by coronavirus and the need to take it seriously.
 Hilton, a hardcore Swift fan, or Swiftie, subsequently posted a photo of herself with the Swift message and more to social media, thanking the star, and "it kind of blew up," she said. The varied outlets, she said, sought "a good story to be able to tell amongst all the sadness that's come of this crisis."
 Hilton calls all the attention her "15 minutes of fame." But she hopes the effort put forth by the healthcare workers still laboring in New York, still caring for all the coronavirus patients there, doesn't get lost in the shuffle.
 "I also want to make sure that the New York nurses and team get recognized because they're the real heroes," Hilton said.

"The fact that testing has become the Achilles' heel that has made it hard for us to have a great national response to this pandemic is a tragedy," said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard's Global Health Institute. "I'd like us to have a massive amount of ubiquitous testing so that, of all the things we need to worry about, testing isn't one of them."
 President Donald Trump insisted again this week that his administration had "met the moment" and "prevailed" on testing, even as he continued to shift responsibility for the effort to the governors. Administration officials said they will provide states with enough testing supplies to conduct about 400,000 tests per day in May and June. But that's still less than half the total recommended by the Harvard team.
 Only nine states met the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues, according to the AP analysis. Most of those states are large and rural, such as Montana, Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming. Meanwhile, states with some of the biggest testing shortfalls, including New York and New Jersey, have signaled they will keep stay-at-home orders in place or only partially ease restrictions.
 "I really do feel there are dangers here to opening up without enough tests, but I don't feel it's a uniform danger everywhere in the country," Jha said.
 In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo will allow many smaller cities and rural regions of upstate New York to gradually reopen first, industry by industry, in areas that have been spared the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak. The first wave of businesses includes retail — though only for curbside or in- store pickup — along with construction and manufacturing. Cuomo also announced that beaches would be allowed to open in time for the Memorial Day weekend.
 New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy will let individual shore towns decide when it comes to reopening beaches. His long-awaited guidance Thursday directed them to set occupancy limits, require 6 feet (2 meters) of space between beachgoers, except family members or couples, and prohibit groups of 10 or more from congregating on the beach.
 California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state's testing reached 35,000 daily this week and that more than 1 million tests have been administered. The state remains on lockdown, though Southern California's beaches are open with restrictions.
 North Carolina also has made testing progress, reporting on Friday an all-time high of more than 12,000 additional tests completed compared with the previous day. But the state's seven-day rolling average of just over 6,000 tests is still well below the 11,000 daily tests recommended by the Harvard team. The testing increases over the past few weeks contributed in part to Gov. Roy Cooper and state leaders feeling comfortable with easing his stay-at-home order May 8.
 Grand Canyon National Park reopened Friday to allow visitors in for day trips but not overnight. By 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying South Rim viewpoints. Signs reminded tourists to keep their distance from one another and stay in groups of less than 10. Park employees also were giving friendly reminders.
 "It's mostly self-awareness, but we are still encouraging the same guidelines" as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Grand Canyon spokeswoman Lily Daniels said.
 Volume of testing isn't the only concern. The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday that it was investigating preliminary data that suggested a rapid COVID-19 test used daily to test Trump and key members of his staff can miss infections. Trump expressed confidence in the test from Abbott Laboratories.
 Worldwide, there have been more than 4.4 million coronavirus infections reported and 300,000 deaths, while nearly 1.6 million people have recovered, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Even Frum's summary about the "Russian Hoax" is misleading - we've long known how much of the important stuff was done, and the fight has been less over "did he do anything wrong?" or even much "how did they dod it" and much more over "give me the goddamn documents, you anti-Constitutional fucks" to prove it. Sadly their attack on the Constitution, stonewalling, obstructing justice, destroying evidence, and simply breaking every political & legal norm they can is being interpreted as somehow a draw, as if they'd played us to a tie in chess rather than overturned the board and locked one of the judges in a closet. (yeah, take that for an allusion to Anthony Kennedy, or any number of cases of judicial foul play).

Cook was looking to lead the way in the trenches for the Buffaloes one more year as a senior, but those plans changed in August when he suffered a season- ending torn ACL in his left knee during a preseason scrimmage against Cave Spring.
 Beale said even with the injury, he was impressed with how the senior still looked to contribute and make his teammates successful.
 “He was just about at every practice helping out with the young offensive and defensive lineman and helping any way he could,” Beale said.
 Even with the disappointing start to the season, Cook said it eventually turned into a positive experience for him, which included watching his teammates knock off Radford 14-12 on senior night in the Buffaloes’ home finale. That helped Floyd County earn a spot in the Region 2C playoffs.
 “I figured it was my time to step up and help, but it was still one of the funniest years I’ve had,” Cook said.
 Cook’s ACL injury prevented him from defending his indoor shot put title this winter as he continued his recovery, but he was cleared in March by doctors to take part in outdoor track just before the spring sport season was suspended by the VHSL.
 “That was the only thing that kept me going. I was getting hyped up for one more sport,” Cook said. “[The suspension] really shocked me. I was totally devastated, but I figured it was for the best.”
 While Cook now looks to put his full attention on the shot put in college, he hasn’t ruled out a possible return to the football field as well.
 “My first year my focus will be on track and rehabbing my knee,” Cook said. “Then my second year ... I might try to walk-on in football.”

The ruling led bars, restaurants, hair salons and other businesses to open immediately or begin making plans to reopen. Fearing that infections might spike as people begin moving around again, about a dozen counties have issued their own stay-at-home orders.
 Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baladauff, blamed the Supreme Court for creating confusion.
 “We said all along there would be chaos if the Supreme Court tossed the governor’s plan and didn’t provide any clear direction and that’s exactly what we have,” she said.
 Adding to the uncertainty Friday was Republican state Sen. Steve Nass, who demanded that Evers withdraw his outline for a new emergency rule to manage the coronavirus pandemic in Wisconsin.
 Nass serves as co-chairman of the Legislature’s joint rules committee, which has to approve any rule before it can take effect. He said Evers’ scope statement indicates he wants to restore elements of the statewide stay-at-home order. Nass’ stance underscores how difficult it will be for Evers, a Democrat, to get any coronavirus rules through GOP lawmakers.
 Baldauff didn’t immediately respond to a follow-up email seeking comment on Nass’ position.

Local health officials across Wisconsin began rescinding their stay-at-home orders Friday after attorneys warned the mandates could be vulnerable to legal challenges after the state Supreme Court wiped out Gov. Tony Evers’ statewide “Safer-at-Home” extension through May 26.
 The Wisconsin Counties Association posted a message on its website after the court ruled Wednesday saying it’s unclear whether local orders mimicking the statewide mandate would stand up in court. Health officials in Kenosha County withdrew their stay-at-home order Thursday night in light of the WCA warning. Brown and Manitowoc counties and the City of Cudahy dropped their orders Friday afternoon.
 “While the WCA and outside legal counsel did not opine that counties were outright prohibited from taking such actions, they did indicate that overall, the legal basis to do so is likely weak,” Brown County’s attorney, David Hemery, said in a letter Friday to the county’s health officer, Anna Destree.
 Evers issued a statewide order in March banning nonessential travel and ordering nonessential businesses to close in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The order was supposed to expire in late April, but state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm extended it to May 26 at Evers’ direction.
 Republican legislators frustrated with the order’s economic fallout asked the state Supreme Court to strike the order down. The court ruled 4-3 on Wednesday to erase the order. Chief Justice Patience Roggensack said the order amounted to an administrative rule that was subject to legislative approval and that Palm lacked the authority to issue it unilaterally.

As health authorities expand testing to more people, the number of positive results should shrink compared with the total number of people tested. The World Health Organization and other health researchers have said a percentage above 10% indicates inadequate testing. South Korea, a country praised for its rapid response, quickly pushed its positive cases to below 3%.
 Most governors are moving ahead with unlocking their states, even in cases where they are not meeting broad guidelines recommended by the White House.
 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has set a goal of 30,000 tests per day as his state launched one of the nation's most aggressive reopenings on May 1. He never set a firm date on when the state would hit the 30,000 mark, but for most of May, the daily testing numbers have fallen well short of that.
 Local leaders say tests are still in short supply. El Paso officials have pleaded with the governor to postpone easing up any more business restrictions in light of the COVID-19 cases there surging 60% over the past two weeks.
 The first stage of Maryland's reopening began Friday evening, when some retail stores were allowed to reopen and a stay-at-home order was lifted. But some of the hardest-hit parts of the state, including the suburbs of Washington, D.C., extended restrictions for residents and businesses.
 Maryland averaged 4,265 tests per day this week, compared with about 4,900 the previous week. Nearly 22 percent of people tested positive in Maryland on average over the last seven days.
 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan made headlines last month when the state acquired 500,000 test kits from a South Korean company in a confidential deal, but Maryland has not had all the components needed for testing — like swabs — to meet demand. Hogan said Maryland just received swabs this week from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 "We requested 350,000," Hogan said Wednesday. "They've committed to 225,000, and I think we got 75,000 yesterday with another 125,000 that are supposedly days away, along with the tubes and the stuff that goes with them. So it's not enough, but it helps us."
 Researchers at Harvard University have calculated that the U.S. needs to test a minimum of 900,000 people per day to safely reopen the economy, based on the 10% positivity rate and several other key metrics. That goal is nearly three times the country's current daily testing tally of about 360,000, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website.

A stadium concert set to be held by Luke Bryan has been postponed until May 30, 2021, due to the coronavirus pandemic. JAC Live president Eric Ryan announced the change on Friday, according to _Business Journal Daily_.
 "Due to the COVID-19 situation and scheduling conflicts, w are moving the event to next so that the community can safely come together when the time is right," Ryan said. Anyone who had a ticket to the June 13 event at Youngstown State University can request a refund from Ticketmaster and receive one within the next 30 days. However, the tickets will also be honored for the new 2021 date. Bryan is set to be the fourth Y-Live concert series at Stambaugh Stadium, which can hold 20,000 people.
 On Thursday, Bryan surprised ICU nurse Cassidy Gubin with a video chat on _Good Morning America_. "Thank you for everything you are doing on the frontline, you're inspiring people like us," Bryan told Gubin. "We're told to sit home and you're told to go straight into the hospital where actively sick patients are so you are certainly a hero to me."
 When not performing, Bryan also works as one of the judges of _American Idol_ , which was just renewed for a fourth season on ABC. However, Bryan, nor fellow judges Katy Perry and Lionel Richie, have been signed on to return. Although that's not unusual, as when the show was renewed for Season 3 last year, the trio of judges didn't renew their contracts for several months. Host Ryan Seacrest is also not signed to return, though that could all change in the coming weeks.

 The show, like numerous other productions, had to adapt mid-season to accommodate the social distancing guidelines that have been put in place as a result of coronavirus. As Bryan, his fellow judges, Seacrest and the contestants all broadcast remotely from their homes, the country singer told _ABC Audio_ back in March that this season has been one of his favorites to work on. "The best part of the new season is we're seeing more songwriters come out with better songs," Bryan said. "Songwriters and people that think that they don't fit the _American Idol_ criteria, they're coming out."
 While Bryan won't be performing at Youngstown State University in June, he will be presiding over the Season 3 finale of _American Idol_. The episode will air Sunday at 8 p.m. on ABC.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As businesses reopened Friday in more of the U.S., an overwhelming majority of states still fall short of the COVID-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks, according to an Associated Press analysis.
 Rapid, widespread testing is considered essential to tracking and containing the coronavirus. But 41 of the nation's 50 states fail to test widely enough to drive their infections below a key benchmark, according to an AP analysis of metrics developed by Harvard's Global Health Institute.
 Among the states falling short are Texas and Georgia, which recently moved aggressively to reopen stores, malls, barbershops and other businesses.
