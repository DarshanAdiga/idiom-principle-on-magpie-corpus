"We have to test more now. We are widening the net of testing. Earlier, it was people with imported cases (people who travelled abroad. Next were people who travelled to other states (New Delhi returnees). Now, we have started local testing as well,” said a senior official.

According to the government official, testing samples in Chennai have been anywhere between 1,200 and 1,300 per day in the recent days. Chennai has recorded the most number of positive cases so far.

In many ways, Tamil Nadu appears to be reacting to the crisis. From the way it dealt with opposition parties or to the question of testing aggressively, the state appears to be eventually arriving at a stance proposed by health experts and opposition parties.

Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram also expressed concerns about the poor and underprivileged who had allegedly been left out of the country's efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

People should realise that final exit from lockdown depends on how well we behave during these testing times to contain the behaviour and spread of the virus.

He said it highlights the widely-held view that there is no room for complacency even as our country did well so far and the gains of 'lockdown 1.0' need to be sustained.

"The prime minister's announcement today extending the lockdown reflects the concerns of the people and other stakeholders at this stage of our collective fight against coronavirus," Naidu said.

However, political analysts are of the opinion that Tamil Nadu downplayed the rate of infection whereas Kerala realised its seriousness and was proactive in containing the spread of the virus.

With a total lockdown affecting livelihoods, PM Modi on Tuesday announced that rules regarding relaxation of lockdown after April 21 in areas that have contained the virus. Detailed guidelines are expected to be released by Wednesday.

The comments came in response to PM Modi's global comparison with India's situation to suggest how strict and early measures helped India arrest the surge, said: "India started screening at airports even before we had one corona positive patient in India... Even though we had 550 cases, India took a big decision to completely shutdown India. We didn't wait for the problem to erupt." The Congress has, nevertheless, demanded that the government should give bonus on Minimum Support Price (MSP), which could be Rs 500. The party also demanded that since the government has already decided that the economy could wait as lives are important, then it needs to come up with equally effective welfare measures to ensure the preservation of life.

Apart from Congress, DMK leader P Thiaga Rajan also called out Prime Minister Modi's speech, taking a dig at previous speeches where Modi had requested Indians to beat plates and light candles on two separate occasions. He also accused the PM of "lying through his teeth", possibly in reference to the PM's claim that India started coronavirus testing early on, and of "playing petty catch-up politics".

"PM's announcement is the best possible course in the given circumstances. The Prime Minister has duly articulated concerns about livelihoods of vulnerable sections assuring that they will be taken care of in the best possible way. I fondly hope the governments will formulate and execute necessary measures for benefit of these sections including farmers and farm workers," the vice president said.

"We are following a protocol for testing till the community spread is well established. Our testing strategy is to test all the family contacts and extended contacts of COVID-19 patients. The third category is symptomatic people in the containment areas, which means that in the area where a case is recorded, we test people who have one of the symptoms. Our other category is to randomly select people with ILI (Influenza-like illness) and SARI (serious acute respiratory infection), and test them to see if there is any spread," the senior officer added.

Congress leader and spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi found Modi's address "amazing" and sarcastically said that though it was full of "exhortation, rhetoric, inspiration," it was "hollow on specifics!". He agreed that the lockdown was "good" but also added that the total lockdown cannot simply be the solution for all. "No financial package, no details, no concrete item. Neither 4poor nor middle class nor industry nor businesses".

He started by saying that he understood the compulsion to extend the lockdown and supported the decision but added that the government had not heeded the advice of economists and experts like John Dreze, Prabhat Patnaik, Raghuram Rajan, and Abhijit Bhattacharya.

The biggest strategic shift in Tamil Nadu has been the change in its stance from “correct, judicious testing” to an aggressive sweep. Over the last week, at least, the state has been raising the number of samples collected in thousands each day. This is a significant transition from a position that only symptomatic cases need to be tested. In fact, in one of the daily press briefings, Heath Secretary Beela Rajesh asserted that people testing negative may show the opposite result after a few days, rendering decisions based on rapid testing ineffective.

Congress leader Manish Tewari also slammed PM Modi for comparing the numbers of Covid-19 deaths and infection with that of other countries as this is a human tragedy. Tewari told the media that this is a human tragedy no nation should suffer due to the virus. "It is not appropriate for the Prime Minister to compare the numbers with other countries but could have said that we are better equipped than other countries," he said.

According to heath secretary Beela Rajesh, the state has also recorded 31 victims under the age of 10, a cause for concern. Tamil Nadu has recorded 11 deaths so far; most of them above the age of 40. Its districts such as Coimbatore and Erode have turned into clear hotspots, with many areas steadily reporting new cases each day. Tamil Nadu was also one of the states where the Tablighi Jamaat returnees came back in droves. The state had earlier announced them separately but after concerns of communalisation, it declared their numbers as a “single source” event.

RK Radhakrishnan, Associate Editor at The Hindu Group's Frontline, said: "Kerala realised the seriousness of the epidemic and roped in people, including all opposition parties as part of its campaign to control the epidemic which has not happened in Tamil Nadu. In Kerala, it is a societal movement and it has touched every single person who is part of the society. It is very clear that Tamil Nadu wanted to downplay the rate of infections, while Kerala was much more transparent, upfront and open about even the minor problems happening in the district government hospitals. In Kerala, social distancing was not just a slogan. This was implemented for journalists and for the cabinet in Kerala, but that was never the case in Tamil Nadu."
