Fettman has 33 years under his belt as a lawyer, with 12 as a prosecutor and 21 as a defense lawyer.
 He represented former prime minister Ehud Olmert's chief of staff, Shula Zaken, in the first public corruption trial in Jerusalem, initially winning a partial acquittal.
 The veteran lawyer has also represented former ministers Avigdor Liberman, Avigdor Kahalani, former prime minister Ariel Sharon's son, Gilad and former top adviser to prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Sheves.
 Despite a broad media narrative that Netanyahu will be convicted in one or more of the three cases he faces, Fettman is strongly optimistic.
 Sources close to Fettman recall that he has been involved in cases like that of the Jacque Yulzari Company. There the media narrative was set that the company, its supervisors and the bus driver would be convicted in the deaths of 17 in a tragic road accident in 1999.
 In contrast, Fettman went through the evidence piece by piece.
 He reasoned with the Nazareth court judges until, little by little, he convinced them in 2006 that the correct decision based on the available evidence was an acquittal.
 At the time of the acquittal, he told the media that even as the court could not declare a clear party responsible for the accident (part of the responsibility was officials who failed to report on a dangerous substance that had been left on the road), justice had been done by acquitting innocent men.
 Similarly, Fettman, along with top lawyer and former top adviser to Ariel Sharon, Dov Weissglass, obtained an acquittal for Kahalani in 2001.
 In that case, he convinced the court that the police had overstepped their authority with aspects of the wiretapping activities they performed.
 Fettman has a talent for honing in on the story underlying the story. He can sense contradictory tensions and complex motivations which often encapsulate how humans act far more than the simple black and white narratives which fit in short headlines.
 This was part of what helped him find problematic moves by law enforcement in the Yulzari and Kahalani probes.
 These instincts may also lead to finding potential issues in the Netanyahu probe (his co-lawyer in the case, Amit Hadad, has repeatedly attacked the process by which law enforcement drafted two key state's witnesses as problematic.)
 So far, Fettman has been effective for Netanyahu, having convinced the Jerusalem District Court to push off substantive issues from the May 24 hearing until July 19.
 Further, it appears that the court may grant his request to put off calling witnesses until January or spring 2021, despite the prosecution's wish to start calling witnesses in August.
 This would be a boon for Netanyahu as he could likely ride out his full 18-month term without getting close to a verdict.
 If Fettman has a firm, but gregarious aura, Hadad presents a deadly serious persona even behind closed doors and at most may drop in a smile as part of a sarcastic attack on his opposition.
 When representing Sara Netanyahu early on in the Prepared Foods Affair, he made public appearances aggressively dismissing the charges as jumping on the prime minister's wife over ordering cheap cafeteria style meals.
 He has also gone on the attack when representing Netanyahu and his advisers Ofer Golan and Yonatan Urich.
 During the October 2019 pre-indictment hearings for Netanyahu before the prosecution, Hadad proclaimed to the media, "we are surprising them," with new legal arguments and perspectives on disputed facts that the prosecution did not expect.
 In December 2019, Hadad appealed to the Supreme Court against the police for trying to hack Netanyahu's advisers' cellphones after they were accused of witness intimidation.
 Hadad said that the police must not get away with having abused Netanyahu's advisers' rights.
 Moreover, he said the Supreme Court should penalize the police for slowly accessing four separate cellphones in the investigation over several days.
 He added that since there is a clear pattern of the police ignoring procedure and since the police had enough evidence to conclude their probe, they should not be allowed to fully search the cellphones in question.
 Currently, there is a second appeal regarding evidentiary disputes regarding Netanyahu's advisers before the Supreme Court.
 In the past, Hadad has given other examples to _The Jerusalem Post_ of major cases he was involved in where he believes the public and the media wrongly condemned someone too quickly.
 Two famous cases involved Boaz Harpaz as well as former defense minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer.
 Ben-Eliezer was indicted in December 2015 for charges of bribery, money- laundering, fraud, breach of public trust and tax offenses, but died in August 2016.
 The prosecution initially accused Ben-Eliezer of laundering millions of shekels by buying real estate, funneling it to bank accounts belonging to relatives, and through the use of currency exchange businesses. He was also accused of taking bribes from a series of associates for advancing their interests.
 In the media, Ben-Eliezer was mostly written off as destined to go to jail for years for serious bribery convictions had he not died first.
 However, Hadad said that in the cases against defendants accused of bribing Ben-Eliezer which went forward, a large portion of the original charges fell by the wayside.
 This means Ben-Eliezer's legal situation, had he lived, would have been much better than portrayed by the media.
 The other example, Boaz Harpaz, was a midlevel retired IDF officer accused of forging a document which led to a political war between then-IDF chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi and then-defense minister Ehud Barak.
 The Harpaz Affair, named for Boaz Harpaz, shook the defense establishment for six years, and recently has been used by Netanyahu as a cudgel against Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit, who was involved in a side aspect of the case.
 Many in the public and the media at one-point suggested Harpaz would get a serious jail term for serious crimes, but he was eventually only sentenced to community service.
 Hadad's point was that the legal nuances which led to reducing much of the Ben Eliezer and Harpaz charges are missed by much of the public and the media.
 Interestingly, Hadad views representing powerful criminal defendants the same as his volunteer representation of many of the victims of polygamist cult- leader Goel Ratzon.
 In July 2016, Ratzon was sentenced to 30 years in prison for a range of sex and financial crimes committed against 21 "wives," who were part of his cult over a period of about 30 years, and with whom he had more than 40 children.
 Hadad said that helping one of Ratzon's victims "get her house back" after Ratzon had forced her to give it up and to "see the happiness from this special woman…this feeling was second to none."
 In addition, he said that he never sees just a guilty, innocent or victimized person.
 Rather, he sees a human being who has a right to be treated fairly and given the benefit of the doubt, whether Ratzon's victims or the prime minister.
 There have been a range of negative media reports about Fettman and Hadad's tactics for Netanyahu or actions for past clients, but each of them are used to the spotlight.
 Still, even with some big victories under their belts, going up against prosecutor Liat Ben-Ari and her team who took down Olmert will be an uphill battle.

“ Babyteeth ” is guaranteed to get under your skin. This refreshingly original Australian indie about a terminally ill teen who falls in love with the wrong guy is designed to push all the buttons: It’ll frustrate, delight, annoy and devastate. In other words, it’s quite the journey. But it’s one that mercifully avoids the trite sentimentality and emotional blackmail that have become clichés of the genre.
 Eliza Scanlen stars as said teen, 16-year-old Milla Finlay, who is living with some kind of cancer. Her parents, Henry (Ben Mendelsohn) and Anna (Essie Davis), are well-off and loving, but it’s not exactly happy times in the Finlay household all things considered.
 Henry is an oblivious therapist whose default fix is plying his wife with drugs, which just means she’s barely there. And Milla, meanwhile, is attempting to maintain a semblance of normalcy, attending her private school and music lessons, while also undergoing chemotherapy and knowing that she might not have much time left.
 It’s under these circumstances that Moses (Toby Wallace) comes crashing, literally, into Milla’s life. He runs into her on a train platform and nearly pushes her onto the tracks. It’s a deranged meet-cute, since Moses is not your typical movie teenager love interest. He is not some dreamy bad boy with a heart of gold. He is a rat-tailed, tattooed, 23-year-old drug addict and dealer.

Adding to this overall feel of comfort are 'strategically-placed' memory foam pads on the heel of the thumb and upper palm. The pads are indeed in the right spot, though they're quite meaty. To this end these aren't minimal gloves – they feel a bit 'belt and braces' on comfort – but their placement and squishiness did the job; they felt good on the tops, hoods and drops. It's worth noting that this feature is a tech-bracket down from the gel in the Altura ProGel Mitt, but the resulting comfort appears similar and, as far as wear and tear goes, there was no sign of deterioration or compressing after a good few wears and washes.

According to the Altura glove size guide I was bang on size small, and the unisex glove provided a brilliant fit with its stretchy polyester/elastane upper and all the coverage you'd want for a day in the saddle. There was a tad more creasing across the upper due to a little extra material – both width and lengthways – than with other female-specific smalls I've tested (despite the advertised anti-crease fabric) so it's possible they won't allow for stretching over time – so consider sizing down if you're not on the cusp.

“We’re all small town, community oriented,” Quinn said. “We’re in the schools. Everybody knows us, and that’s what we want.”
 Being out on the streets and roads on patrol is important to Quinn. She said the administrative part of the job gets tiresome, but she enjoys the people, even though working in her hometown wasn’t her original plan.
 “Rob Godfrey was a deputy here, he was leaving,” Quinn said. “He called and said, ‘Hey, we have a position open,’ and I’m like, ‘Do I really want to go back to my hometown?’ There’s some good things, bad things. ... No, it was not my intention to come back here, It just so happened there was an opening here, so I applied and here I am.”
 Open communication keeps the department running as smoothly as possible, Quinn said.
 “Talk to me,” she said. “I’ve always said that I can’t fix it if I don’t know something is going on. I’ve got to know, so at least I can try within my means. I’ve always said that. From the day they’re hired, I will tell them that.”
 Quinn describes the people of Garden County with seven words.
 “Big county, small towns with big hearts,” she said. “I think that’s the easy way to explain it. We just had a (storm) come through Lisco (June 6). ... It just destroyed Lisco, and there were a lot of people who came together. That’s what we do.”
 Yost said the people of the county come together to support each other in times of need.
 “It seems like when the chips are down, people tend to come out of the woodwork to help out their neighbors,” he said.
 That spirit of working together extends to the sheriff’s department.
 “Everybody comes together and does whatever job needs to be done at the time,” Yost said. “We all see what needs to get done and do it, versus, ‘well, I’ve got a thing, I’ve got to leave.’ Everybody tends to drop what they’re doing and if another officer needs something, they’re right there.”

DETROIT (AP) — A dramatic shift has taken place in the nation’s opinions on policing and race, as a new poll finds that more Americans today than five years ago believe police brutality is a very serious problem that too often goes undisciplined and unequally targets black Americans.The new findings from&nbsp;The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research&nbsp;suggest the death of George Floyd and the weeks of&nbsp;nationwide and global protests&nbsp;that followed have changed perceptions in ways that previous incidents of police brutality did not.About half of American adults now say police violence against the public is a “very” or “extremely” serious problem, up from about a third as recently as September last year. Only about 3 in 10 said the same in July 2015, just a few months after Freddie Gray, a black man, died in police custody in Baltimore.In the latest poll, roughly 3 in 10 said police violence is a moderately serious problem. Those who say it is not a serious problem has declined from a third in 2015 to about 2 in 10 today.Floyd, a black man, died in late May after&nbsp;a police officer in Minneapolis&nbsp;pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Experts say the dramatic change in opinion about police violence that has followed is an indication the country is grappling with how to confront centuries of structural racism and inequity.“I have long argued that we cannot have a racial reconciliation in the United States because there’s not been an admission of what has gone on,” said Wornie Reed, director of the Race and Social Policy Research Center at Virginia Tech. “The nation is constructed on (racism). … It’s not an accident or something that America decided to do on the way to its greatness. It’s the means by which it became great.”The new AP-NORC poll finds that more Americans now think police in most communities are more likely to use deadly force against a black person than a white person, 61%, up from 49% in July 2015. Only about a third say the race of a person does not make a difference in the use of deadly force against them, compared with roughly half in 2015.And Americans are far more likely now than they were five years ago to say that police officers who cause injury or death in the course of their job are treated too leniently by the justice system, 65% vs. 41%, rather than too harshly or fairly. Fewer now think they’re treated either fairly or too harshly.Changes in opinions about social issues are more often slow and incremental, said Jennifer Benz, the deputy director of the AP-NORC Center. Benz said such significant changes can often indicate meaningful or lasting change has taken place in public awareness and attitudes.“The data show noteworthy changes of a magnitude we don’t see very often, especially on long-standing cultural or social issues,” Benz said. “While this poll was certainly conducted at a moment of tremendous attention on racism in our society, we have empirical signals from other data to suggest that these changes are not purely a reaction to the current events.”Among white Americans, 39% call police violence against the public a very serious problem, up from 19% in 2015, while 35% say it's moderately serious. Most black Americans continue to say police violence is a very serious problem.The poll also found that 51% of black Americans say they have been unfairly treated by a police officer because of their race, compared with just 6% of white Americans.That includes Mississippi resident Sandra Smith, who said she and many others she knows have had uncomfortable encounters with police over the years. Smith also feels many white Americans are unaware of the fear or anxiety black Americans experience in those interactions.“I think it has reached its boiling point and I say that it’s like a volcano that was waiting to erupt,” said Smith, a 61-year-old black woman. “And looking back on 400 years of oppression of African Americans and the atrocities that we had to face to try to even make it in this country, when you look at all those things, the rights that were not given to the black man, those things build up.”Majorities of Americans across racial groups say police use of deadly force is more common against a black person, including 92% of black Americans and 54% of white Americans. Five years ago, just 39% of white Americans said police were more likely to use deadly force against a black person.Separate from use of deadly force, the poll also finds about 7 in 10 Americans say white people are treated more fairly in dealing with the police in general, while about a quarter say the race of a person does not make a difference. Nine in 10 black Americans and 7 in 10 white Americans say white people are treated more fairly.“My eyes have been opened in the last month of how serious the problem really is,” said Jeffrey Boord-Dill, a 62-year-old white man, who lives in Kentucky. “I think it was a problem before now, but not nearly on the level that I see today, and having people of color tell their stories and putting myself in their shoes from those stories, I can’t imagine how damn tired everybody is of walking out the door and wondering if they’re going to come home or not. That, in this country, is inexcusable.”___Fingerhut reported from Washington. AP video journalist Noreen Nasir in Chicago contributed to this report.___The AP-NORC poll of 1,301 adults was conducted June 11-15 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.
