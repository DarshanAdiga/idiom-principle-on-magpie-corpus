For the time being he has his family, the Provencal sunshine and the satisfaction of knowing that he is part of one of the most charged and vital films of the year. “I feel proud and lucky that I got the call [for Da 5 Bloods],” he says. “Because it’s about humanity. I’m in some kind of step against racism.”
