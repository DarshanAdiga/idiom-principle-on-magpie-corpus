  You know things are serious when even the animals are practicing social distancing.


  Isaw a pair of alley cats on North Main in Pratt face off on a lawn the other day and it was rather fascinating. They just stared at each other without saying a thing. Or at least I couldn't hear anything from my car.


  The gray cat stood with tail close to its body and kept its eyes on the yellow cat lying on the lawn. The yellow cat's fur looked like it was ruffled up or wet.


  Whatever the condition of the fur, both cats kept their eyes focused on each other and never seemed to move. I first spied this standoff as I drove up North Main. I was too far past them to get a good picture so I circled the block, hoping they would still be there. I realized this also says something about how much I needed to have something to do rather than sit at home and work from the west end of the dining room table. But I digress.


  I circled the block and there they were, still standing and sitting like statues. I got a couple of pictures and watched for a while but neither cat made a move. The stare was intense. It was as if both were waiting for the other to make a move and didn't want to blink or they might miss it.


  There are times it would handy to be Dr. Dolittle, the man who could talk to the animals, and find out just what was going on here. Did one of the cats cross into another cats territory? Was there a dispute over who would get first dibs at a fresh bowl of milk? Was there another cat that had come between these best of friends? Maybe one was a bully and wouldn't let the other leave.


  Whatever the cause, these cats held fast to their spots and weren't going to be the first one to budge.


  It's all speculation but one thing is for certain, never challenge either of these cats to a staring contest.


  I watched, thinking one or both would move but the staring match continued.


  I finally decided to leave and let them work out whatever they needed to work out. I took one last look in my rear view mirror and they were still there.


  So, this is for all you cat lovers out there. Maybe you can figure out why these two were locked in a visual stare down. Maybe they were just practicing social distancing but my guess is it was something much more basic.


  I think they did it just because they are cats and that is all the reason they need.

Frank Lampard has no concerns over Chelsea's young players, despite conceding his side were far below their best against Leicester City.
 Ross Barkley came on from the bench to score in the 63rd minute on Sunday, securing a 1-0 victory to send Chelsea through to the FA Cup semi-finals, with Manchester United up next on July 18 or 19.
 However, Lampard's side were second best in the first half, with the Blues boss making three changes at half-time – Barkley being one of the alterations.
 Mason Mount, Billy Gilmour and Reece James were the players to make way, but Lampard insists he has full confidence in the young trio.
 "The first half wasn't what we're used to in terms of performance this season," Lampard, who took advantage of the temporary rule allowing five substitutions, told a news conference.
 "We seriously lacked urgency and intensity in the first half, so the three subs... I probably could have made more subs or different subs.
 "Of course, if we didn't have the extra subs, I wouldn't make the three at half-time, but the reason the subs are here is because they are trying to prevent injury and understand that the players have missed a proper pre- season.
 "We can probably look at that we had three big games in a week, a very difficult game on Thursday, so I'll allow us a bit of credit, and the fact they showed enough to turn it around against good opposition.
 "I don't think we have played that badly this season in 45 minutes; we played a lot better and lost games. So when it looks like I'm criticising, I'm actually positive that it's not the norm for us but it felt like it had to be addressed.
 "I could've made different changes as well. In Mason's situation, he played two games in a week and gave a lot of input against Man City. Reece James hasn't played in a long time since going into lockdown and Billy's the same, so there are contributing factors around it.
 "They are going to be top players, they will have top careers in football - that's the players they are - so whether you can call it a learning experience, I did do that.
 "They are all good lads, they train well and I've never had a problem with them at all, so I've got no worries."
 One player who did draw Lampard's praise was goalscorer Barkley, who has looked sharp since the resumption of the campaign.
 "I played with Ross and I know he's a great lad. He wants to be the best player he can be and has a great attitude," Lampard added.
 "Before lockdown, he put in some really good performances for us, his attitude has been spot on in training, he looked after himself in lockdown, and he was unfortunate not to start against Aston Villa. Since then, he's made an impact in every match he's played.
 "I've got lots of time for Ross. He's a big player for us - you saw that today and in the last three games."

Not even Sanderson, who is overseeing the process, knows the results thus far.
 Despite the head start, Sanderson suspects the county’s results may come later than normal because mail-in ballots can still arrive until 7 p.m. Tuesday. No absentee ballot results — including early in-person voting tallies — can be released until the final mail-in ballot is processed.
 “It’s not uncommon to receive through the mail special delivery from the postal system a ballot after 6 p.m. on election night,” he said.
 The Muskogee County Election Board plans to hold a special meeting Monday to open and verify mail-in voter affidavits, said Kelly Beach, the county’s election secretary. He said the county sent out 1,109 ballots. During the June 2016 primary, it only mailed 316.
 Still, Beach said he doesn’t expect any delays on election night. He said in- person early voting has gone smoothly thus far. His county has seen an increase in early voting participation.
 “We’ve moved where we usually hold that to a bigger space, and it’s really worked out well,” he said. “I’m really pleased with it.”

Saturday June 27, 2020 former Bell County Sheriff Bruce Bennett passed away.


  The Bell County Sheriff’s Department would like to take this opportunity to honor a man who did more than just serve our community, he genuinely cared about those he served and worked tirelessly in showing that everyday.


  Bruce took over the office of Bell County Sheriff in January of 2003 after his general election win against incumbent Harold Harbin. He was asked at the time what he wanted to do if he was elected and he said he wanted to work to solve the county’s drug problem, assure a good state audit, and to lower the crime rate in the area so businesses would want to come to Bell County. He served three terms in office.


  Many that worked with Bruce shared their thoughts with us.


  Bell County Judge Executive Albey Brock said of Bruce “it was a true honor and a pleasure to serve with Bruce Bennett as sheriff and myself as Judge Executive. If there were ever a person who cared about the youth of Bell County, I have not met them. It was Bruce Bennett’s life mission to make and try to make Bell County a safer place for the youth. He had a true passion for the kids of our community. He will be sorely missed, often remembered, and forever respected.”


  Pineville Mayor Scott Madon said that he was “saddened to hear of the passing of a longtime family friend. Bell County has lost a true legend, as he will long be remembered as a man of honesty, respect and a true statesman. He could arrest someone, and they would not feel hard at Bruce because he always treated them with respect.”


  Middlesboro Mayor Rick Nelson said that “with the passing of Bruce Bennett I lost a friend, and the citizens of Bell County lost a true honest hard-working sheriff. Bruce had a stern exterior, but he had a heart of gold for children that were affected by the scourge of drugs. He did everything in his power to eliminate the drugs in our county.”


  Knox County Sheriff’s Sgt Carl Frith who worked as a deputy for Bruce said “I started with Bruce early in my career he taught me to get respect is to give it, and he also showed me how to treat people the right way. He was such a father figure to us and wanted to help everyone even when he couldn't. He was always a man of his word, if he said it, he'd do whatever it took to do it. The last few years I worked for him I called him pap. He will be missed”


  Commonwealth Attorney Karen Greene Blondell says “It deeply saddens me to learn of the death of Sheriff Bruce Bennett. For many years, we worked together to make Bell County a safer place to live. He never failed to assist my office in the prosecution of the county's most serious crime. He was a kind and good man.”


  Bell County Circuit Judge Robert Costanzo says “I was saddened to learn of the passing of Sheriff Bennett. He and I worked together during his tenure as Sheriff. I developed a great respect for Bruce and considered him a good friend. He cared deeply for the citizens of Bell County, especially the youth of the community). He will be greatly missed. However, that which he gave so tirelessly to our community will survive for generations to come. God bless and may he rest in peace.


  Bell County Sheriff Mitch Williams says "I am saddened to hear about the passing of Sheriff Bruce Bennett. A good man who devoted his life to serving the people of Bell County as well as the Commonwealth of Kentucky.


  The Bell County Sheriff’s Office extends our prayers to Sheriff Bennett’s family and ask that you keep them in your prayers as well."


  Funeral arrangements will be announced at a later time.

Facebook spokesman Tucker Bounds said the latter option was never seriously considered.


  The document also listed possible "PR Risks" for each. For example, lowering the standards overall would raise questions such as, "Would Facebook have provided a platform for Hitler?" Bickert wrote. An opening for political speech across the board, on the other hand, risked opening the floodgates for even more hateful "copycat" comments.


  Ultimately, Zuckerberg was talked out of his desire to remove the post in part by Kaplan, according to the people. Instead, the executives created an allowance that newsworthy political discourse would be taken into account when making decisions about whether posts violated community guidelines.


  That allowance was not formally written into the policies, though it informed ad hoc decision-making about political speech for the next several years, according to the people. When a formal newsworthiness policy was announced in October 2016, in a blog post by Kaplan, the company did not discuss Trump's role in shaping it.


  In an interview, Bickert said the company ultimately made a call to maintain Trump's Muslim ban video because executives interpreted Trump's comment to mean that the then-candidate was not speaking about all Muslims, but rather advocating for a policy position on immigration as part of a newsworthy political debate. She said she did not recall the document where the options were presented.


  Facebook's Bounds added that the "newsworthiness" policy was added in 2016 after content reviewers removed a photo of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. "Our goal was to recognize the essential public benefit of preserving content that in other contexts wouldn't be allowed," Bounds said. "In the case of elected officials, it also ensures that they will be held to account for their words," so people can judge for themselves.

Trump responded two days later with an executive order that could hurt social media companies by removing a key exception that limits their liability for content posted on their sites.


  The next day, Trump tweeted about the Minnesota protests. Twitter quickly labeled the tweet for violating rules about glorifying violence, and Snapchat stopped promoting Trump's account the following week. YouTube told The Post that it holds politicians to the same standards as everyone else.


  Facebook, on the other hand, chose to haggle with the White House, asking for a deletion or a change, said the people. Axios first reported the call, which Facebook's Bounds confirmed to The Post.


  As employees raged on internal message boards and externally on Twitter, Zuckerberg told workers that Facebook's policies might change again in light of Trump's post. The company had rules allowing for "state use of force," he said, but they were vague and didn't encompass the possibility that such pronouncements could signal harmful aggression. Bickert's team planned policy meetings for the weeks ahead.


  In June, Facebook removed Trump campaign ads with Nazi symbolism after an initial internal assessment that found that he ads did not violate the company's polices, according to documents viewed by The Post. In meetings, senior executives argued that not removing them would be perceived as pandering too much to the president, according to a person familiar with the discussions.


  Last week, the advertiser boycott picked up steam. Hershey, Verizon, Unilever, Coca-Cola and others said they were temporarily pulling ads.


  On Friday, Zuckerberg told employees in a live-streamed town hall that he was changing the company's policy to label problematic newsworthy content that violated the company's policies as Twitter does, a major concession amid the rising tide of criticism. He also said in the most explicit language thus far that the company would remove posts by politicians that incite violence and suppress voting. Still, civil rights leaders said his assertions didn't go far enough.


  "There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies that I'm announcing today," Zuckerberg said.

I don’t worry about getting older, but I really don’t want to lose my teeth. I think about it so much I often dream of looking in a mirror and all of my teeth are loose — or it could be because I have periodontal disease and my gums are receding. I will do most anything to avoid a toothache. Even mild- mannered people turn into mean maniacs with pain that is relentless, unless you can knock yourself out with strong medicine or find someone to pull the culprit out.
 Funny how the life cycle brings everything back around sooner or later. The 7-year-old grandsons are losing teeth right and left and think it’s the best thing since sliced bread. I’m doing everything in my power to keep from losing just one.

Citing a logistical nightmare for parents and concerns for children's mental health, a London District Catholic school board trustee says he wants to keep families together when pupils return to school this fall.


  Last week, the Education Ministry announced pupils will likely have a rotating schedule blending in-class and remote learning, with boards developing different scenarios depending how COVID-19 is spreading come September.


  North London trustee and former principal Gabe Pizzuti said he put forward a motion at Monday's board meeting after the board sent a notice to parents last week that hinted some siblings or pupils living in the same household may have to attend school on different days this fall.


  He also heard several complaints from parents, he said.


  "The motion is (seeking) the assurance that all students will attend elementary school this September together as a family," he said.


  One rationale for the motion is taking children's mental health into account by reducing "stress and anxiety," Pizzuti said.


  "We really want to maximize children's mental health. During the first week of school, if a child's in Grade 1 and one's in Grade 8, they always touch base," he said. "Children this September will need consistency; they will need structure with a family organization."


  Parents also have to go back to work, he said.


  "I have three (kids). Can you imagine if one went (to school) on Tuesday, one went on Wednesday and one went on Thursday?" he said. "It's a total disaster."


  Board officials say they will try to keep families together, but can offer no guarantees due to the way learning is being mapped out.


  "We're going to try to ensure families are together. We are going to do everything we can," said board spokesperson Mark Adkinson.


  The board is trying to work out who goes where and when alphabetically, he said.


  "Nothing has been decided yet, but say we do A through M go to school Monday and Tuesday and N through Z go to school Thursday and Friday -- in an ideal world, it would be very straightforward, but family situations nowadays are more complicated," he said.


  Siblings with different last names could fall into different groups, for example, leading to a logistical problems, he said.


  "The whole intent is to have everybody in the same household go to school on the same day, both high school and elementary," Adkinson said. "The schools are going to work with families. It's a process. We want to make sure we keep families together and keep families safe."


  Pizutti said the motion will be heard at the board Aug. 31 meeting.

It also places Facebook in growing conflict with its counterparts in Silicon Valley. Twitter has labeled several presidential tweets as abusive and misleading, and social media platform Snapchat curtailed the reach of the president's account.


  "The value of being in favor with people in power outweighs almost every other concern for Facebook," said David Thiel, a Facebook security engineer who resigned in March after his colleagues refused to remove a post he believed constituted "dehumanizing speech" by Brazil's president.


  Facebook says the use of incendiary populist language predates social media. Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communications, said in a statement that populism wasn't invented in Silicon Valley, pointing to centuries of political history before social media companies' existence.


  "From the Arab Spring to local candidates challenging political incumbents, social media has also helped to open up politics, not favor one side over the other," Clegg added. "Studies have shown the drivers of populism are complex and cannot be reduced to the use of social media, in fact political polarization has fallen in many countries with high internet use."

As I painted Thorpe Hall that afternoon, all I could think about was to be in my bedroom, at my desk, typing up the essay that I had written earlier that day.

_It is the first day of summer vacation of 1969. I am 15 years old and have just completed my sophomore year at Boonton High School. It is nearing high noon and I have spent the entire morning painting Thorpe Hall of Saint Andrew’s Episcopal Church, for my Eagle Scout project. After eating my lunch, a man comes to the door and begins banging on the door and demanding that I let him in. Fortunately, I had locked the door. I try to huddle out of sight of this man, who is continuing to hammer on the door and scream for someone to let him in. Shortly after that, my mom knocks on the door of Thorpe Hall. My sister, Patti, is with Mom. I clean up and we all go to Moe’s Sweet Shop. Cute Mary Tafano is at Moe’s. To my utter surprise, Mary asks me to her birthday party on Saturday. Later that afternoon, I help Mom to get supper ready, while my sister Patti plays in the yard, with her neighborhood friend. After supper, Dad comes into my room, while I am at my desk and offers words of encouragement and hope to me. Morning comes, Dad drives me to Thorpe Hall on his way to work. In Thorpe Hall that morning, I hand write an essay, “What Scouting Means to Me.” My plan was to give it to Mr. Marino, Editor of the Lincoln Park Herald, for him to publish. Our story continues._

Columns share an author's personal perspective and are often based on facts in the newspaper's reporting.


  America's reckoning with historic memory has taken some strange turns in this season of disease and discontent. Monuments long ignored are falling every day, mostly for good reasons, though some of it has been messy.


  Confederates are in retreat across the map. Statues of Confederate leaders are being dismantled, mostly on the orders of local officials whose constituents no longer want to celebrate the champions of a white supremacist rebellion. Portraits of four former House speakers who served the Confederacy were just exiled from the U.S. Capitol. The Confederate battle flag has been banned from NASCAR events and Walmart stores in Mississippi are refusing to fly the state flag because it includes the Confederate stars-and-bars.


  The Confederates' ideological soulmates are joining them in exile. The Lost Cause historians have been sent packing. It's a new day, especially in the South.


  Confederates aren't the only ones taking a beating. Columbus was decapitated in Boston and will be dismantled in Philadelphia. A statue of Juan de Ornate, a particularly nasty conquistador, is being removed in Albuquerque. Protesters are coming after Andrew Jackson who, to be honest, deserves it.


  People are taking a fresh look at statues that have gone unnoticed for decades. They are questioning the individuals the monuments exalt, the events they celebrate, the cultural and historical context in which they were erected, the aesthetics of the statuary. American history teachers and art historians must be thrilled.


  For some monuments, the problem isn't the subject, but the presentation. A statue of Theodore Roosevelt in New York is being moved because TR's placement on a horse makes the figures walking alongside, a Native American and a Black man, look subservient. The Freedman's Memorial in Washington, was built with money donated by former slaves, dedicated in 1876 with a speech by Frederick Douglass. It honors Lincoln and celebrates emancipation, but the pose - Lincoln standing over a Black man rising from his knees - while common in Abolitionist imagery, is uncomfortable to some modern eyes.


  Evaluating each monument's history, message and aesthetics can be tricky. Communities that do it right empanel committees, consult with historians, listen to activists and community members, weigh alternatives. Elected officials make the decisions and courts consider legal challenges. The result isn't just the removal of a statue; it's a sharpened understanding of the community's historic record and contemporary values. That's how democracy is supposed to work, by giving everyone a voice.


  Then again, you could skip the boring democratic procedures and use chains to tear the statues down. That's how a tiny minority of impatient activists - or provocateurs - are expressing themselves.


  In Philadelphia, someone defaced the statue of abolitionist Matthias Baldwin. In Madison, Wisconsin, a breakaway group that first told peaceful protesters to go home toppled a statue of abolitionist Hans Christian Heg, who died fighting for the Union. In San Francisco, where tributes to the Confederacy are hard to find, a mob toppled a bust of U.S. Grant, who defeated the Confederate armies, suppressed the first Ku Klux Klan and got the 15th Amendment, guaranteeing voting rights for all, put into the Constitution.


  Who decided U. S. Grant must be toppled from his perch? How representative were they of the communities on whose behalf they choose to act? Where was the discussion of Grant's life and legacy, of the origin, context and meaning of the statue in Golden Gate Park? Even anarchist collectives give all members a chance to speak before deciding what to order for breakfast or what to blow up. Where was the vote to tear down the statue of a hero in America's struggle for racial justice?


  Regrettable and undemocratic, to be sure. But every party needs a fringe and every movement has a vanguard. We must not let the rhetoric and tactics of extremists distract from what is really happening here. America is coming to grips with its history, with a seriousness we haven't seen in 50 years.


  This focus on America's history of racism, violence and injustice is a sign that the movement we're seeing is deeper than calls for police reform. The breadth of the protests, seen in every state, in small towns as well as big cities, points to a turning of the tide. The diversity of the people who have taken to the streets - "Black Lives Matter" being shouted by Americans of every race, every age, every background - and polls showing they are supported by a strong majority of voters, make this a historic moment.


  The Rev. William J. Barber, a grassroots leader based in North Carolina, calls it "the third reconstruction." Like the first two reconstructions, the Civil War era and the Civil Rights era, this is a fusion movement, powered by people of all races and backgrounds building a more righteous future together. "If we are willing to see ourselves as we are and have been," Barber writes, "we will also see our potential for prophetic resistance, even in times like these."


  In Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy, people have for years called for a huge statue of Robert E. Lee to be taken down. City officials supported the change, but the state Legislature blocked them. But in the last few years Democrats have taken over the governor's office and the Legislature, which enacted a new law giving municipalities authority over such decisions.


  But something interesting has happened on Lee Circle while Virginians wait for the courts to make way for deconstruction crews. Over the last six weeks, Lee's statue has become a gathering spot for Black Lives Matter protesters. Its stone pedestal has become a canvas for graffiti artists. At night, images of African-American heroes are projected on its surfaces. It has become a site for music and dance, conversation and selfies, an ongoing celebration of Black lives.


  It's enough to make ol' Bobby Lee fall off his horse in amazement, and it's another sign of history in the remaking.

The migrant worker who died after a large outbreak of COVID-19 at a Southwestern Ontario farm was a 55-year-old father of four from Mexico.


  The Migrant Rights Network has identified the man as 55-year-old Juan Lopez Chaparro, a father of four, who has been coming to Canada since 2010. He worked at the Scotlynn Group farm in Vittoria, in Norfolk County, about an hour south of London.


  He had been in intensive care in London hospital after falling ill along with nearly 200 others connected with the farm.


  "It's definitely sad and hits close to home for us," Scott Biddle, president and CEO of Scotlynn Group, said Monday afternoon. "It's been a challenge, for sure. It never feels real until it happens to you."


  Biddle said the death of Chapparo has been especially difficult on a nephew who has been coming north to Scotlynn from Mexico for the past three years. Scotlynn is arranging to fly the nephew home to Mexico so he can be with his family.


  Scotlynn will bring him back in several weeks. "He will come back in August and finish out the busy time of the year," Biddle said.


  There are currently 199 positive cases among Mexican migrant farm workers at Scotlynn and 18 cases among people associated with the farm, local public health officials say.


  On Friday, it was reported that three of Scotlynn's migrant workers were in hospital and two in intensive care.


  Migrant farm workers arrive every summer in rural communities across Southwestern Ontario's vast farm belt, doing the hard labour many Canadians won't. Many live in bunkhouses, cramped living quarters that could be especially troubling during a contagious pandemic like COVID-19.


  The outbreak at Scotlynn occurred in six bunkhouses occupied by 221 offshore workers from Mexico. The outbreak began in late May. With so many workers sidelined for health care or for quarantine, the outbreak forced Scotlynn to abandon a portion of its asparagus harvest.


  The Haldimand Norfolk Health Unit is appealing the Ontario's Health Services Appeal and Review Board's decision to strike down a rule limiting bunkhouses to three migrant workers during their mandatory, 14-day quarantine period.


  The Haldimand-Norfolk jurisdiction is the only farming area in the province to have such a regulation.


  The review board struck down the three-man cap as "arbitrary" and "unreasonable." Farmers say the order prevents them from situating workers in a timely fashion, creating labour shortages across the two counties at a critical time of the growing season. Local growers say it puts them at a disadvantage to other farmers in the rest of the province.


  Scotlynn is one of several farm operations where migrant workers have fallen ill with COVID-19, along with others in St. Thomas and the Chatham-Kent community of Kent Bridge.


  The death of the two migrant workers near Windsor led Mexico to temporarily stop allowing workers to leave for Canada, sending shock waves through the agricultural sector, which is highly dependent on foreign labour.


  But the Mexican government says it has now struck a deal with the federal Liberal government that will lead to improvements in the temporary foreign worker program.


  In a press release late Sunday, Mexico says Canada has committed to increased inspections, as well as more support for Mexican officials and workers to identify and report unsafe working conditions.


  A working group will also be set up with Mexican and Canadian government officials to deal with the issue.


  In a letter to Mexico's ambassador to Canada, sent Friday, federal employment minister Carla Qualtrough says Canada is committed to ensuring the safety of people crucial to Canada's food security.


  A copy of the letter was obtained by The Canadian Press.


  It lays out some of the detailed options under consideration by the federal government, including assessments of farms where there have been outbreaks to see what instructions need to be improved, as well as increased inspections on farms where new clusters of COVID-19 infection emerge.


  The federal government also promises to reach out to employers to make sure they are following all the rules that have been put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 on farms.


  "In cases of significant non-compliance by employers of temporary foreign workers, strict sanctions will be applied," the letter says.


  Meanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford says farmers must help the province have their workers tested for COVID-19 -- and if farmers do not participate, he may be forced to use other measures to ensure testing is conducted.

You know things are serious when even the animals are practicing social distancing.


   


  Isaw a pair of alley cats on North Main in Pratt face off on a lawn the other day and it was rather fascinating. They just stared at each other without saying a thing. Or at least I couldn't hear anything from my car.


   


  The gray cat stood with tail close to its body and kept its eyes on the yellow cat lying on the lawn. The yellow cat's fur looked like it was ruffled up or wet.


   


  Whatever the condition of the fur, both cats kept their eyes focused on each other and never seemed to move. I first spied this standoff as I drove up North Main. I was too far past them to get a good picture so I circled the block, hoping they would still be there. I realized this also says something about how much I needed to have something to do rather than sit at home and work from the west end of the dining room table. But I digress.


   


  I circled the block and there they were, still standing and sitting like statues. I got a couple of pictures and watched for a while but neither cat made a move. The stare was intense. It was as if both were waiting for the other to make a move and didn't want to blink or they might miss it.


   


  There are times it would handy to be Dr. Dolittle, the man who could talk to the animals, and find out just what was going on here. Did one of the cats cross into another cats territory? Was there a dispute over who would get first dibs at a fresh bowl of milk? Was there another cat that had come between these best of friends? Maybe one was a bully and wouldn't let the other leave.


   


  Whatever the cause, these cats held fast to their spots and weren't going to be the first one to budge.


   


  It's all speculation but one thing is for certain, never challenge either of these cats to a staring contest.


   


  I watched, thinking one or both would move but the staring match continued.


   


  I finally decided to leave and let them work out whatever they needed to work out. I took one last look in my rear view mirror and they were still there.


   


  So, this is for all you cat lovers out there. Maybe you can figure out why these two were locked in a visual stare down. Maybe they were just practicing social distancing but my guess is it was something much more basic.


   


  I think they did it just because they are cats and that is all the reason they need.

The arrogance of this argument is breathtaking. As I will show, there is not a shred of evidence that any Member of Congress interpreted the statutory text that way when Title VII was enacted. See Part III–B, infra. But the Court apparently thinks that this was because the Members were not “smart enough to realize” what its language means. The Court seemingly has the same opinion about our colleagues on the Courts of Appeals, because until 2017, every single Court of Appeals to consider the question interpreted Title VII’s prohibition against sex discrimination to mean discrimination on the basis of biological sex. See Part III–C, infra. And for good measure, the Court’s conclusion that Title VII unambiguously reaches discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity necessarily means that the EEOC failed to see the obvious for the first 48 years after Title VII became law. Day in and day out, the Commission enforced Title VII but did not grasp what discrimination “because of …sex” unambiguously means. See Part III–C, infra. …

The concessions to Trump have led to a transformation of the world's information battlefield. They paved the way for a growing list of digitally savvy politicians to repeatedly push out misinformation and incendiary political language to billions of people. It has complicated the public understanding of major events such as the coronavirus pandemic and the protest movement, as well as contributed to polarization.


  And as Trump's power grew, the fear of the president's wrath pushed Facebook into more deferential behavior toward its growing number of right-leaning users, tilting the balance of news people see on the network, according to the current and former employees.


  Facebook is now confronting a mounting advertiser boycott that has pushed down its stock price as companies demand stricter policies against hate speech. Starbucks became the latest on Sunday to say it would suspend social media advertising.


  Facebook is also facing a slow-burning crisis of morale, with more than 5,000 employees denouncing the company's decision to leave up Trump's post that said, "when the looting starts, the shooting starts."


  Bowing to those pressures on Friday, Zuckerberg announced policies aimed at better policing content on the site. That includes affixing labels on posts that violate hate speech or other policies - even on those from political leaders.


  But the company said the post wouldn't have qualified.


  As the United States heads into another presidential election while facing a pandemic and civil unrest, the latitude given to Trump may afford him an advantage. In recent months, he has used Facebook and other platforms to tout misleading information about coronavirus cures, election fraud and the motives of protesters, frequently targeting a left-wing movement as a cause of violence without citing evidence.

For players looking to hone their skills this summer, E&G Baseball Academy has an option.


  As both the Santa Fe Little League and Santa Fe AABC canceled their baseball and softball seasons because of the COVID-19 pandemic, players are left on their own to develop their skills. Ian Farris and George Dellos, co-owners of the academy, are offering a summer development program for a limited number of players.


  Farris, who is the head baseball coach at Santa Fe High, said the program is normally offered in the fall, but with competitive baseball effectively on the shelf, he and Dellos decided a summer program would be ideal.


  “You can't even practice a little bit, so that’s kinda weird,” Farris said. “We’ve had one-on-one and small-group sessions, but this will be nice because we can get our coaches who usually help us for summer teams back into the mix.”


  That will help with the number of groups the academy will have. It will be a two-day-per-week, six-week program with five age groups for players between 8-18. Farris said each group will be limited to 10 players, and cost is $300 per participant. The sessions will include player assessments of their movement, hitting and throwing, as well as video analysis and other computer programs designed to maximize player evaluation.


  Farris said individuals also will receive individual programming to help them with specific areas they can improve upon as well maintain and improve other skills. Perhaps the most important part of the program is the variety of competitive games the players will get to simulate as much as possible.


  “Having a game-like environment is super important,” Farris said. “It’s amazing how your tee swing and your front toss swing are totally different from each other, and those are completely different from what actually happens when a pitch is coming to you. So, we want to test what will happen once you’re in a game.”


  Farris said that the development camp will also be held in the fall. Interested players can register at engbaseballacademy.com/registration.
