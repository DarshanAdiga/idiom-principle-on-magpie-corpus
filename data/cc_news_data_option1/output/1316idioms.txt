Riporto una parte di un articolo di Wsvn 7 news pubblicato oggi: _“Even while deferring to governors, the Trump administration has issued guidelines that have urged Americans to work from home if possible, cancel on-site instruction at schools and avoid large gatherings. The resistance to a more robust response comes even as Vice President Mike Pence said White House models for the coronavirus toll show the country on a trajectory akin to hard-hit Italy. Speaking to CNN, Pence said, “We think Italy may be the most comparable area to the United States at this point.” Italy, which has already recorded more than 13,000 deaths, has issued a nationwide quarantine, shutting down almost all industrial production and offices and largely prohibiting residents from leaving their homes. The U.S. has recorded more than 5,000 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.”_

BEIJING (AP) — Global stocks declined Friday after soaring U.S. job losses tempered enthusiasm about a possible deal to stabilize oil prices amid anxiety over the global economic decline due to the coronavirus pandemic.Markets in London and Frankfurt traded lower while Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney closed down. Tokyo ended little-changed after spending part of the day in negative territory.Some markets followed Wall Street higher after President Donald Trump said on Twitter he expected major oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia to back away from their price-cutting war. But by midday, most Asian markets had retreated again.U.S. data showing 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment this week were a “hard dose of economic reality,” said Jeffrey Halley of Oanda in a report.That was double the previous week's record-breaking U.S. job losses of 3.3 million. It raised the total number of Americans who are out of work due to the coronavirus-driven downturn to almost 10 million.On Friday, the government’s monthly jobs report is due and is expected to show that the American jobs machine came to a sudden halt in March as a result of the coronavirus. Economists have forecast employers shed about 150,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate rose from a half-century low of 3.5% to 3.9%, according to FactSet.In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London sank 1.1% to 5,420 and Frankfurt's DAX shed 0.3% to 9,5537. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.9% to 4,182.On Wall Street, futures for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both off 0.9%.On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.3% after Trump said he expects production cuts are coming after talking with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2% and the Nasdaq rose 1.7%.In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6% to 2,763.99 and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1.5 points to 17,820.19. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.2% to 23,236.11 after falling as much as 0.8% earlier.The Kospi in Seoul ended unchanged at 1,725.44 after being down 0.6%. Sydney's S&amp;P-ASX 200 declined 1.7% to 5,067.50 and India's Sensex lost 1.9% to 27,727.19.Benchmark U.S. crude added $1.30 to $26.62 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $2.32 to $32.26 per barrel in London.Markets usually welcome lower energy costs for companies and consumers. But the abrupt plunge to below $20 this week from $60 at the start of the year triggered fears heavily indebted producers might default, undermining credit markets.On Thursday, U.S. crude surged $5.01, or almost 25%, to $25.32 per barrel following Trump's comments. The Kremlin denied President Vladimir Putin had talked with the prince but Saudi Arabia called for a meeting of major producers including Russia.Traders expect more volatility in financial markets until numbers of new coronavirus cases begin to decline, which forecasters say might be weeks away.The number of confirmed cases worldwide has topped 1 million, led by the United States with more than 236,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.More than 51,000 have died, but more than 208,000 have recovered.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.The dollar edged up to 108.54 yen from Thursday’s 107.90 yen. The euro declined to $1.0793 from $1.0856.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Automotive sector is a highly lucrative end user of servo press. The global market for servo press has been highly influenced by the growing adoption of servo press in automotive. The increasing sale of automotive and growing vehicle parc have resulted in increasing carbon emissions, consequently making the automotive sector a large contributor to the greenhouse effect. With a view to reduce carbon emissions, several manufacturers are focusing on developing green technologies and vehicles that are fuel efficient. This has spurred the demand for vehicles of light weight. Since recent past, the automotive industry is continually working on the enhancement of the fuel economy by producing light weight vehicles as an attempt to battle global warming. To achieve this, steel with high tensile strength, that enables thin body panels in the vehicle, along with lightweight aluminum alloys are being used on a large scale. This has resulted in the use of servo press to carry out metal forming applications.

_Ecco il testo della lettera_
 “Carissimi fratelli e sorelle, l’impegno che ci viene chiesto della segregazione in casa per contrastare la diffusione del contagio del Covid 19, quest’anno ci priva della gioia delle celebrazioni pasquali, che ci hanno sempre visto così numerosi partecipare ai riti della Domenica delle Palme e del Triduo Pasquale. Siamo chiamati ad offrire al Signore il disagio e la privazione, così acutamente avvertiti in questi giorni, come “un sacrificio” offerto per amore e perciò a Lui gradito.
 Papa Francesco ha ricordato a tutti la consapevolezza della Chiesa, affermata fin dagli inizi e contenuta anche nel catechismo della Chiesa Cattolica, che, nell’impossibilità di accedere al sacramento, il suo vivo desiderio procura già il dono di grazia del sacramento stesso. Il desiderio del Perdono e della Riconciliazione con il proposito di accedervi appena questo sarà possibile, già al presente ottiene il perdono di Dio e la riconciliazione che viene da Lui. Così anche l’Eucaristia, oggi desiderata, che speriamo quanto prima di poterla ricevere, ottiene già ora l’intima unione con Cristo e con i fratelli. Quando siamo privati di alcuni beni, ne riusciamo ad apprezzare il valore e l’importanza.
 Così sul piano umano, oltre al valore della vita e della salute, questa situazione ci fa avvertire la necessità e la bellezza degli affetti, della prossimità, dei legami di amicizia e dell’essere una sola umanità nella quale tutti siamo legati a tutti. Così anche sul piano della vita di fede. La nostra saggezza sarà nel mettere a frutto quanto la privazione di questi giorni ci avrà insegnato. I tre giorni della Pasqua (Triduo), dalla sera del giovedì santo fino alla sera della domenica di risurrezione sono il cuore di tutto l’anno liturgico. Nel cuore di questo cuore c’è la veglia pasquale, la celebrazione nella notte in cui il Signore Gesù è passato dalla morte alla vita. La luce che brilla e si espande nel buio è il segno eloquente del Signore risorto, la proclamazione delle pagine della scrittura fa risuonare la sua parola che chiama dalla morte alla vita, nel segno dell’acqua si rinnova per noi la grazia e l’impegno del battesimo, nella partecipazione alla cena dell’Agnello il Signore ci nutre, ci fa crescere e camminare verso il suo ritorno glorioso.
 Alla veglia giungiamo dopo aver contemplato nel venerdì Santo il crocifisso, ascoltandone il racconto della passione e venerando la Croce gloriosa e dopo aver fatto memoria del dono dell’Eucaristia nella celebrazione del giovedì Santo. Quest’anno non ci sarà possibile attuare il gesto rituale della lavanda dei piedi, però ci è dato di viverne il senso in verità e intensità: la condivisione e la cura verso chi, a causa della vita sospesa di questi giorni, è scivolato in condizioni di estrema necessità. Oggi più che mai i fatti ci dimostrano che chi si prende cura del prossimo, cura e fa bene a se stesso. In questi giorni al Vescovo nella Chiesa Cattedrale, ai parroci nelle parrocchie è possibile celebrare in maniera molto ridotta e con la presenza solo di un diacono, di un accolito, di un lettore, di un cantore e dell’organista, assicurando l’osservanza di tutte le disposizioni richieste per la prevenzione del contagio.
 Voi, tramite i media (TV, Facebook…), potrete unirvi alle celebrazioni del Santo Padre, a quelle delle vostre parrocchie dove viene offerta la diretta streaming, oppure a quelle presiedute da me in cattedrale. La Messa Crismale è rinviata a data da destinarsi. Anche per i giorni della Settimana Santa sul sito diocesano sarà offerto il sussidio La famiglia in preghiera, per tutte quelle famiglie che in questi giorni vogliono trovarsi insieme in un momento di intensa preghiera. Quest’anno vivremo una Pasqua che ci sembrerà meno bella per le persone che a causa del coronavirus non sono più in mezzo a noi, per quanti sono in cura, per tutti noi che non potremo esprimere a pieno la gioia della festa con i gesti dell’affetto e della prossimità. Sarà, però una Pasqua più vera e, perciò, più santa. Auguri di Buona Pasqua! Vi porto tutti nel cuore e vi benedico!”.

Coronavirus has become New Jersey’s most common cause of death, according to figures released Thursday.
 The death toll rose to 537 after 182 more deaths were reported by the state on Thursday. That latest figure surpasses the 154 deaths, on average, every day caused by heart disease, cancer, various accidents, and the seven other most common causes of death in 2018, the latest year for which annual Department of Health figures have been published.
 “The difference with COVID-19 is that New Jersey residents can take steps to reduce and prevent the spread,” Eddy Bresnitz, a former state epidemiologist and deputy health commissioner who is now a member of the department’s COVID-19 response team said in a statement.
 Among the casualties of the pandemic is Israel Tolentino, a 33-year-old firefighter for the City of Passaic, who died Tuesday after battling the virus for nearly two weeks. The former U.S. Marine and a married father of two was laid to rest Thursday. Tolentino was remembered for his easy smile and his relentless push to help others.
 The total number of people infected with the virus in the state rose by 3,489 to 25,590.
 Gov. Phil Murphy stressed during his daily briefing that the new figures for deaths and those testing positive did not all come in during the past 24 hours.
 Labs throughout the state are overwhelmed and there’s a delay in getting test results that could be 10 to 14 days, state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said.
 Murphy also noted that it’s been only 12 days since he instituted his most stringent social-distancing move: his stay-at-home order.
 “We’re still a week or so away from really knowing what those last set of actions we took, what impact those have on the positives,” the governor said.

his reference is a favorite meme of Trumpies on social media because it's something that actually happened and it's all they've got so they're running with it. Our doofus mayor as well as some in our city govt. encouraged people to go to the Chinese New Year parade, without fear, including on social media, in order to counter prejudice against Asians about the virus. I'll remind that Mayor Doofus also waited until the last minute to cancel the St. Paddy's Day parade (as well as going to his own gym in Brooklyn.) He's a panderer to the protest of the moment, and identity politics in a deficient manner and very scattered about it to boot. All the better our Gov. is constantly yellin' at him, eyes-on-the-prize style. De Blasio is not exactly the crowing glory of the Empire State, managerially speaking. He's a pander bear but without skill or forethought. In the past he's been clueless fodder for the right. So far what he's been good at is shaking down pay-for-play political donations. Of the coronavirus press conferences I've seen by him, they have not been not reassuring, he sounds like the proverbial chicken with his head cut off. Hopefully someone more competent is actually running this show and one does get this impression if one follows what's up.

Il sindaco di Rimini, Andrea Gnassi, interviene sullo stato attuale dell'epidemia di Coronavirus alla luce anche dei numeri che nel nostro territorio sono in progressiva diminuzione. Il primo cittadino, pero, invita a non abbassare la guardia e a continuare a seguire alla lettera le prescrizioni per evitare inutili contatti che potrebbero riaccendere il focolaio di Covid-19 e rendere inutili i sacrifici fatti fino ad oggi. "Sinora e stata dura, durissima - commenta il sindaco. - Abbiamo cambiato le nostre vite, abbiamo chiesto a tutti di restare a casa e alle imprese di chiudere. Ma non e finita qui. Rimini, i sindaci della provincia di Rimini, il Prefetto, gia da settimane ormai hanno deciso di intraprendere la via piu ripida per tutelare la salute e salvaguardare il sistema sanitario al limite. Una serie di prescrizioni e di limitazioni molto rigorose che la Regione Emilia Romagna ha accettato, quindi esteso alla provincia di Piacenza, e infine quel modello e stato fatto proprio dall'ultimo decreto governativo. Su questa stessa strada, dobbiamo procedere ancora almeno fino al 13 aprile. Questo non e il momento di tirare il fiato, ne un sospiro di sollievo. Al contrario.
