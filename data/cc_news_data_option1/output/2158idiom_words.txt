“We obviously have the capacity,” Bob Chapek, Disney’s chief executive, said by phone last week, adding that he was “very optimistic” about making a deal with the league. Chapek noted that the ESPN complex has “turnkey” broadcasting capabilities, including an ultrahigh-speed fiber-optic connection to ESPN’s headquarters in Connecticut.

The talks with Disney involve a late-July restart to the season.                                                                                                                                                                     “We hope to finalize those plans soon,” Mike Bass, an NBA spokesman, said in an email Monday.
