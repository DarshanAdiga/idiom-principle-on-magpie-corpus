Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber is likely heaving a huge sigh of relief that the attention of the nation's media is focused on COVID's infestation of the White House, the Senate battle over the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett and, of course, the looming national election. Were it not for these stories (and a handful of other newsworthy events such as continuing violence in one American city after another), Eisgruber's September 2 letter openly admitting that the fabled Ivy League school engages in "systemic racism," would be vying for front-page news coverage.


  Eisgruber's letter, however, did not escape the eye of lawyers at the U.S. Department of Education; and it should _not_ be allowed to be swept under the rug.


  Two weeks after the Princeton President's highly unusual _mea culpa_ , Robert King, the Education Department's Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education, sent a letter to the university demanding that the admissions made by Eisgruber be explained and documented. The Department gave Princeton 21 days to provide the required evidence of its self-admitted racism, and one more week after that to schedule interviews "under oath" by Eisgruber and other Princeton officials.


  So far, there has been no publicly acknowledged response to the Education Department's demand letter, other than a September 18 press release by the University stating that it "stands by" Eisgruber's letter and  would "respond" to the federal government "in due course."


  Not surprisingly also, several dozen other university presidents quickly leaped to Princeton's defense. In a letter made public only a few days following the Education Department's letter, presidents of the seven other Ivy League schools and dozens of other colleges and universities including, of course, uber-liberal Wesleyan University and Amherst College, blasted as "outrageous" the fact that the federal government would have the gall to demand that a sister university must actually provide evidence for the sins to which it openly admitted.


  The stakes for Princeton and other schools that receive taxpayer dollars are hardly inconsequential. As noted in Assistant Secretary King's letter, over the course of Eisgruber's seven-year tenure at Princeton's helm it has received "well over $75 million" in federal funds. Problematically for Princeton, however, as with other postsecondary schools receiving such monies, Princeton has been required regularly to certify that it does _not_ engage in racial or other unlawful forms of discrimination -- the very practices to which Eisgruber so blithely admitted just one month ago.


  In thus placing Princeton on notice that its "woke" claims of systemic racism are, to say the least problematic and at worst clear violations of federal laws, the Trump administration is hoisting Princeton on its own petard as the Shakespearian expression colorfully describes.


  If the school actually provides evidence that it has engaged in and continues to practice racially discriminatory policies, as its president has declared, it not only risks losing significant federal funds going forward, but could be liable for repayment of monies already received.


  If, on the other hand, the school admits it was making the statements about systemic racism for the sole purpose of burnishing its "wokeness" credentials as a sop to leftwing activists, it will discredit not only its own leadership and pedagogy, but that of much of our country's post-secondary education system.


  The most likely outcome, at least in the short term, will be for Princeton to stall for time, hoping that November 3 will usher in new leadership at the White House and at the Department of Education; leadership that will be far more "understanding" of the rank hypocrisy deeply infecting the country's post-secondary education system.


  If Biden were to defeat Trump next month (or whenever the election results are certified), the case against Princeton will not only go away, but Eisgruber likely would be in line for promotion and for rewards in recognition of the extreme courage his woke letter exhibited. If so, it is not Eisgruber and his leftist cohorts who will suffer, but rather the deteriorating quality of education that further generations of students of _all_ racial backgrounds will receive.

Juventus took to the field despite no opposition arriving to compete last night, with Napoli having been told not to travel, and chairman Andrea Agnelli has moved to defend his club’s decision.


  Earlier in the week, the fixture was placed under a cloud of doubt when Napoli received two positive test results, while their most recent opponents Genoa have as many as 19 positive cases at present, including five non-playing staff members.


  Napoli insist that they attempted to board a plane to travel to Turin to take on Juve yesterday afternoon, but were not permitted to travel by local authorities ESPN reported.


  Juventus had two positive COVID-19 results with non-playing staff, but still took to the field for the clash, despite the likelihood that Napoli weren’t to show.


  Chairman Andrea Agnelli has defended his decision to take to the field however.


  “There are very clear protocols for these situations,” Agnelli told Sky Sport Italia (as translated by Forza Italian Football). “It was expected that a situation like this would come up.


  “The FIGC protocol for matches in Italy applies in this case, as was approved by the Ministry of Health.


  “We know what to do and that is to go into isolation. In our case the technical team, which includes the entire playing staff isolates, in order to continue training and the ability to play matches.


  “It is very clear. And when we knew of the two positives within the team, we immediately put the group into a bubble in order to play the match against Napoli.”


  Lega Serie A had earlier stated that the fixture was still to go ahead, which obviously did not happen, but an appeal looks likely to follow.


  Is there any chance that Napoli could persuade the FA to rearrange the fixture?

Last month, Morocco’s state media quoted Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson of the UN chief, who advised Polisario against any obstruction aimed at hindering commercial and regular traffic in the region.
 Speaking on behalf of the UN chief, Antonio Guterres, Haq stressed that “no action shall be taken that might constitute an alteration of the status quo in the buffer zone.”
 The UN deputy spokesperson recalled that such maneuvers escalate tension in Guerguerat and elsewhere in the buffer strip.
 The buffer zone is under the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, and is therefore subject to strict surveillance.
 The UN spokesperson urged the Polisario Front to immediately leave the zone.
 Polisario’s illegal actions in the region came just weeks before the UN is set to issue its annual report regarding the situation on Western Sahara.
 The UN chief has previously condemned illegal actions in the region that would hinder the development of the UN-led political solution to find a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.
 In January, Guterres issued a statement to denounce Polisario’s threats against the Monaco Dakar Rally.
 Polisario launched several threatening campaigns, warning participants in the Africa Eco Race against crossing the Guerguerat buffer zone.
 In response, the secretary-general expressed concern about increased tensions in Western Sahara.
 On behalf of Guterres, a spokesperson called on all parties to the conflict to exercise maximum restraint and defuse any tensions.
 For Guterres, it is necessary to allow “regular civilian and commercial traffic to proceed” in the buffer zone.
 Because Polisario’s provocations are not the first of their kind in the region, observers expect the UN chief to renew his warnings against any illegal moves that breach UN resolutions in Western Sahara in his new report on the situation.

After conducting several raids at multiple locations throughout Monday, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) accused Congress leader Shivakumar of amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 75 crore.


  "The CBI has registered a case against former Minister of Karnataka Government(Presently MLA) on the allegations of possession of disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs.74.93 crore(approx) in his name and in the name of his family members," the agency said issuing a statement.


  "It may be recalled that Government of Karnataka has issued a Notification u/s 6 of DSPE Act and it was followed by a Notification u/s 5 of DSPE Act issued by Government of India after which CBI had initially registered a Preliminary Enquiry during March, 2020 against the said MLA and others in the matter," the statement read.


  "Searches were conducted today at 14 locations including Karnataka, Delhi, Mumbai at the premises of said MLA and others which led to recovery of cash of Rs.57 lakh(approx) and several incriminating documents including property documents, bank related information, computer hard disk etc. Investigation is continuing," it said.


  The CBI conducted simultaneous raids at multiple locations across the country, including residences as well as business establishments, connected with Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar and his brother DK Suresh. These 14 locations that the probe agency raided include 9 in Karnataka, 4 in Delhi, one in Mumbai.


  Shivakumar was arrested on September 23 last year by ED in the money laundering case and was lodged in Delhi's Tihar Jail under judicial custody. He was released a month later after Delhi High Court granted him bail.

In 1817, the year the Symphony was first published, Beethoven provided metronome markings not only for this piece but also for all his previous works of the kind. Many of those markings seem improbably fast, and they have proved to be controversial, to say the least; but John Eliot Gardiner takes them seriously and there are some hair-raisingly quick tempos here. In the opening movement of Symphony No. 2 it’s possible to feel that a less sweeping performance would have allowed for more clarity of detail and greater weight, but there’s no doubting the visceral excitement of the playing. The slow movement of the same work receives a glowing performance, with Gardiner not afraid to allow the strings to use portamento for expressive effect. His easing of the tempo as the music turns to the minor at the start of the middle section is another nice touch.

The Election Commission of India on Monday held its first hybrid, that is virtual and in-person, meeting with over 700 general, police and expenditure observers across nearly 120 locations, to discuss the upcoming polls and bypolls. The meeting was attended by chief election commissioner Sunil Arora and election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar.
 The elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly, the first big state polls since the outbreak of coronavirus, will commence on October 28. Additionally, 56 assembly and one parliamentary by-election will also be held in November.
 The commission has already issued guidelines to ensure Covid safety, the most recent being the decision to send booth-level-officers to the houses of elderly (over 80 years) and differently abled voters (PWD), to see if they would want to cast their vote via postal ballot.
 In a statement issued regarding the observers' meeting on Monday, the EC said Arora gave a perspective on the impact of Covid-19 on election schedules globally and the detailed deliberation and assessments done by the poll body before taking the decision to conduct elections in Bihar.
   
   
 "He underscored the need to be extra careful as this election will be keenly watched by the world community as it is the largest election in the world to be held amid the pandemic. He reiterated the EC's commitment to conduct an election that is free, fair, transparent, ethical and also Covid safe. He stated that the strength of a democracy rests in its primary stakeholder- the voter," the statement added.
 Arora also said that all efforts must be made to 'instill confidence in the voter to come to the polling station on election day to cast her/his vote safely and freely'.
 "Two Special Expenditure Observers have already been appointed by the Commission and if required other such Special Observers would also be appointed as the election process progresses," the statement added.
 The two special observers were appointed on Sunday, barely a day after the poll body visited Bihar and sacked its excise commissioner for 'inadequate preparedness'. The special observers will keep watch on all monetary matters related to the polls, including distribution of incentives such as alcohol and cash for votes.
 Commissioner Chandra advised officers to pro-actively redress complaints and ensure impartiality while discharging their duties, added the EC statement.
 Another commissioner Kumar said the officers should always bear in mind they are the actual face of the EC on ground.
 ECI secretary-general Umesh Sinha specifically briefed the officers on election planning, while deputy election commissioner Dharmendra Sharma spoke about the training process already conducted for the polling personnel. DEC Sudeep Jain highlighted EVM, VVPAT management and electoral roll issues, with his colleague Chandra Bhushan Kumar spoke about legal provisions, Model Code of Conduct issues specifically in Covid scenario for Bihar elections.
 "DEC Ashish Kundra briefed the observers on the specific IT applications… each of the sessions laid emphasis on the extra dimension of Covid-safe election and the broad guidelines issued by the Commission," the EC said.

Illinois had a $2.7 million deficit in fiscal year 2020 and is projected to have a $7.4 million deficit in fiscal year 2021.


  The state took out about $6 billion in federal loans when passing its $43 billion budget this May. Grossi said this effectively pushes the problem along to future years.


  “Even before COVID, the state of Illinois has been struggling financially,” he said.


  The district is set to receive $37,260,000 in state funding in fiscal year 2021, the same amount as the previous fiscal year.


  This is the first year since the state’s evidence-based funding formula changed that funding for the district has remained flat and not increased.


  “What’s going to happen in future years? We don’t know, but when you look at the state’s problems, you need to prepare for whatever is going to happen,” Grossi said.


  The school district will also receive federal and state grant funding, including about $2.3 million from the federal CARES Act to pay for COVID-19 needs such as PPE supplies and one-to-one technology.


  The district’s revenues are projected to be as high as they have been in 10 years due to grant money, he said.


  Grossi said he anticipates a delay in grant payments this year, however.


  Typically, the district will spend the money that has been promised in grants and then get reimbursed at a later date.


  “I’m a little nervous about the timing of our payments this year and what that is going to look like… Across the board on grants, I project we receive 90 percent back of what we spent,” he said.

  “All of us who pay MLEC for our electricity are the members of our MLEC cooperative,” he wrote. “We should have a right to vote on major MLEC projects and be able to voice our concerns to our MLEC board members representing our districts.”


  Cron reiterated that the project simply isn’t at that point yet, with the purchase just being finalized.


  In negotiations, she explained, everything was contingent on the cooperative receiving the conditional use permit for the land, which was just approved Sept. 21.


  Now that has been approved, Cron said the cooperative’s board of directors is just starting the process of deciding if the project is even economically feasible.


  Cron said that if the pieces do not fall into place, the cooperative will put the land up for sale and consider other options. But when the land became available, it was too good of an opportunity to pass up.


  Cron said that the majority of MLEC’s members are located between the north shore of Mille Lacs Lake and the city of Aitkin, and that the cooperative is looking for a site south of Aitkin to allow trucks easy, convenient access to not only customers, but to highways and gas for the trucks.


  “There’s gas right there,” she said. “There’s Hwy. 18 right there. There’s great access to our existing infrastructure.


  “(MLEC) is a mainstay of this community,” she added. “It’s a critical resource. If the board does not feel this is a responsible decision, we will not move forward with the project.”

  # 3 win Nobel medicine prize for discovering hepatitis C virus


  By DAVID KEYTON and FRANK JORDANS Associated Press


  Associated Press


  STOCKHOLM (AP) — Americans Harvey J. Alter and Charles M. Rice and British- born scientist Michael Houghton jointly won the Nobel Prize for medicine on Monday for their discovery of the hepatitis C virus, a major source of liver disease that affects millions worldwide.


  Announcing the prize in Stockholm, the Nobel Committee noted that the trio's work identified a major source of blood-borne hepatitis that couldn't be explained by the previously discovered hepatitis A and B viruses. Their work, dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, has helped saved millions of lives, it said.


  “Thanks to their discovery, highly sensitive blood tests for the virus are now available and these have essentially eliminated post-transfusion hepatitis in many parts of the world, greatly improving global health,” the committee said.


  “Their discovery also allowed the rapid development of antiviral drugs directed at hepatitis C,” it added. “For the first time in history, the disease can now be cured, raising hopes of eradicating hepatitis C virus from the world population.”


  WHO estimates there are over 70 million cases of hepatitis C worldwide and 400,000 deaths from it each year. The disease is chronic and a major cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis requiring liver transplants.


  John McLauchlan, a professor of viral hepatitis at the University of Glasgow, called the 3 laureates “pioneers" and said their discovery made the global elimination of the disease possible. In 2016, the World Health Organization issued a strategy to wipe out the disease by 2030.


  “That would mark the first time we might possibly control a viral infection using only drugs,” McLauchlan said.


  “The only issue is getting drugs to people and places where they desperately need them,” he said, adding that the disease primarily strikes stigmatized populations like drug users and the poor.


  Alter, who was born in 1935 in New York, carried out his prize-winning studies at the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, where he remains active, the committee said. Rice, born in 1952 in Sacramento, California, worked on hepatitis at Washington University in St. Louis and now works at Rockefeller University in New York. Houghton, born in Britain in 1950, studied at the Chiron Corporation in California before moving to the University of Alberta in Canada.


  The medicine prize carried particular significance this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has highlighted the importance that medical research has for societies and economies around the world.


  Will Irving, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said that identifying hepatitis C had been the “holy grail” in medicine.


  “After hepatitis A and B were discovered in the 1970s, it was clear there was still at least one other virus or more that were causing liver damage,” he said.


  “We knew there was a virus in the blood supply, because when people had blood transfusions they would get liver damage,” Irving said. “It was recognized as a risk but there was nothing we could do. We didn’t know what the virus was and we couldn’t test for it.”


  Nobel Committee member Patrik Ernfors drew a parallel between this year's prize and the current rush by millions of scientists around the world to combat the coronavirus pandemic.


  “The first thing you need to do is to identify the causing virus,” he told reporters. “And once that has been done, that is, in itself, the starting point for development of drugs to treat the disease and also to develop vaccines against the disorder.”


  Unlike hepatitis A, which is transmitted via food or water and causes an acute infection that can last a few weeks, hepatitis B and C are transmitted through blood.


  American scientist Baruch Blumberg discovered the hepatitis B virus in 1967 and received the 1976 Nobel Prize in medicine, but this did not explain all cases of chronic hepatitis, a disease that was becoming more common even in apparently healthy people who had received or given blood.


  “Before the discovery of the hepatitis C virus, it was a bit like Russian roulette to get a blood transfusion,” said Nobel Committee member Nils-Goran Larsson.


  Alter was working at the U.S. National Institutes of Health when he discovered that plasma from patients who didn't have hepatitis B could also could transfer the disease.


  “The breakthrough came in 1989, when Michael Houghton and colleagues working at Chiron Corporation used a combination of molecular biology and immunology- based techniques to clone the virus,” said Nobel Committee member Gunilla Karlsson-Hedestam.


  Later, Rice confirmed that a cloned hepatitis virus alone could cause persistent infection in chimpanzees and reproduce the disease observed in humans.


  The hepatitis C virus belongs to a group known as flaviviruses that also includes West Nile virus, dengue virus and yellow fever virus.


  Thomas Perlmann, the Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, managed Monday to reach two of the winners, Alter and Rice.


  “I had to call a couple of times before they answered," he said. "They seemed very surprised and very, very happy.”


  Graham Foster, professor of hepatology at Queen Mary University, said the discovery of hepatitis C had prevented millions from getting sick or dying of the disease or other liver problems and that the awarding of the Nobel to Alter, Houghton and Rice was very well deserved.


  Foster said the discovery has had significant impacts in both developing countries, like Egypt and Pakistan, where millions were infected via contaminated medical equipment or procedures, and in developed countries like the U.S., where the blood supply itself was often contaminated.


  “This discovery allowed for safe blood transfusion and it allowed the rapid development of treatments for hepatitis C,” Foster said. “We are now in a position where we have drugs that are 96% effective if you take a pill for eight weeks.”


  The Nobel Committee often recognizes basic science that has laid the foundations for practical applications in common use today.


  “It takes time before it’s fully apparent how beneficial a discovery is,” said Perlmann. “Of course these serological tests have been around for quite a while, but the antiviral drugs that emerged as a consequence of this significant discovery have been much more recent.”


  The prestigious Nobel award comes with a gold medal and prize money of 10 million Swedish kronor (over $1,118,000), courtesy of a bequest left 124 years ago by the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.


  Monday's medicine award is the first of six prizes this year being announced through Oct. 12. The other prizes are for outstanding work in the fields of physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — The Dallas Cowboys defense is giving up points at a rate unseen since the franchise's winless inaugural season six decades ago, and their offense keeps giving up the ball even while scoring in bunches.
 "There was a lot of good football that will go totally unrecognized. That's what happens when you lose," coach Mike McCarthy said. "What I don't like, is I don't like the pattern of the four games that we've played. The points are outrageous, the time of possession is totally lopsided, and we're minus-7 in the turnover ratio. That's not a winning formula."
 Quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott lost fumbles on consecutive offensive snaps in the second quarter, turning a tie game into a two-touchdown deficit before halftime on the way to a 49-38 loss Sunday to the Cleveland Browns.

They represent life but also death and fragility. They are symbols of mourning but also of joy.”

New Delhi [India], October 5 (ANI): Therapeutic, diagnostics and vaccines for the whole world is the only way out of this pandemic, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday.   Addressing the special session of World Health Organisation (WHO) Executive Board, Vardhan said, "We all understand that therapeutic, diagnostics and vaccines for whole world, only way out of this pandemic. Global collaboration is paramount. Governments, Industry and Philanthropy must pool resources to pay for the risk, the research, manufacturing and distribution but with the condition that rewards would be available to everyone regardless of where they have been developed."   "We also understand that strengthening emergency preparedness and risk management, key to addressing health risk posed by emerging diseases and progress towards sustainable development goals," added Vardhan who is also the chairman of WHO Executive Board.   Vardhan also acknowledged the member states for displaying solidarity to help each other during evolving pandemic.   "I must take this opportunity to acknowledge all member states for acting with speed and scale during the rapidly evolving pandemic and displaying solidarity to help each other on a bilateral as well as a multilateral basis. The hard work and determination demonstrated by the countries have saved countless lives," he said.   Speaking at the virtual event Vardhan said everyone at WHO should rise to the occasion to reaffirm the fundamental truth that world is one.   "I believe, we at WHO must all rise to the occaission to save the powerless and the voiceless to hopes in these darkest of hours. This is one chance, one moment to forge open collaborations and reaffirm the fundamental truth that the world is one," he said. (ANI)

While Prescott became the first NFL quarterback to throw for at least 450 yards in three consecutive games, the Cowboys (1-3) allowed a franchise-record 307 yards rushing and are the first team since the Raiders in 2012 to allow 38 or more points three games in a row in the same season. The only time the Cowboys had ever done that was during their 0-11-1 debut in 1960.
 "We've just got to do a better job of preparing and really coming with our full hearts in the game and play this game for 60 minutes straight," defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence said. "It's just all about going down and really showing that you're a real man out there and playing together."
 Even with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, all followed by successful 2-point conversions, the Cowboys couldn't pull off another big comeback victory, like two weeks ago in winning McCarthy's home debut when Prescott and Elliott also had lost fumbles against Atlanta.
 The Cowboys then had turnovers on consecutive plays last week at Seattle — on their last snap of the first half, and then first snap after halftime in a 38-31 loss.
 "We keep hurting ourselves on offense, putting our defense in bad spot. And not starting fast enough, that's what's been killing us over the past few games," Prescott said. "That's definitely frustrating, is just making the same mistakes over and over."

Level five restrictions must be imposed on the entire country to keep schools open, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has warned. In his letter to the Government, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Tony Holohan said a &ldquo;graduated approach&quot; to Covid-19 rules will not work and recommended the introduction of the most severe restrictions under the five level plan for living with the virus.Mr Holohan said there has been a &ldquo;sustained increase&rdquo; in the number of cases among people over 65 which has risen from 6 per 10,000 to 67.3 per 100,000 in just over a month.The returning CMO said there are currently 31 outbreaks in nursing homes with seven reported in the last week. He said there are 25 outbreaks among vulnerable groups, with 10 in Direct Provision centres, seven among the Traveller community and another seven in homelessness services.He said the number of people hospitalised due to Covid-19 has increased from eight to 12 admissions a day in just a week. He said there are 22 critical cases and warned that 243 of the country&rsquo;s 281 intensive care unit beds are occupied. He said there were four deaths in August but 34 in September.&ldquo;In light of the above, he Nphet believes that proactive and robust measures must now be taken such that a very significant suppression of the disease with a reproduction number well below 1.0 is achieved,&rdquo; Mr Holohan said.&ldquo;It is therefore recommended that the Government apply level five measures across the country from midnight on Monday 5 October for a period of four weeks,&rdquo; he added.Nphet said it is &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; to the impact of the measures on families, communities and businesses but said it &ldquo;firmly believes&rdquo; this action is needed to get the disease back under control while keeping schools open.&ldquo;The Nphet advises that the profile of the disease is such that the graduated approach will not have sufficient or timely impact on the trajectory of the disease and will not protect the core priorities set out above.&ldquo;A graduated approach would, ultimately, result in application of level five measures as mitigation. In contrast, the immediate application of level five is intended to limit the impact on the public,&rdquo; the letter said. The restrictions will only work if there is &ldquo;broad societal buy in and adherence&rdquo;, he added. He also called for more enforcement of the restrictions.

While it was not possible to detect the exact infection vector that allowed the attackers to overwrite the original UEFI firmware, Kaspersky researchers deduced one option of how it could be done based on what is known about VectorEDK from leaked Hacking Team documents. These suggest, without excluding other options, that infections might have been possible through physical access to the victim’s machine, specifically with a bootable USB key, which would contain a special update utility. The patched firmware would then facilitate the installation of a Trojan downloader – malware that enables any payload suitable for the attacker’s needs to be downloaded when the operating system is up and running.

On the first night of October 2020, a "Harvest" full moon shone as bright as a giant lantern that had broken free from its earthly bonds. The next morning as Kit and I set out on our morning walk, the brilliance of the moon and stars began to fade with the approaching dawn. At that moment, time fell backward to a journey Kit and I made 18 years ago to celebrate the life of his niece Faerial Mahmood -- daughter of his eldest sister, Kate. What follows is that remembrance.


   


  Sitting in the Bradley Field air terminal as we prepare to fly home, there's finally time to reflect on all that has happened over the past two days. I'm holding a bouquet of long-stemmed pink roses pulled from the rich abundance that recently filled the Mt. Carmel Congregational Church in Hamden, Conn. My heart is full.


   


  A stone at the entrance to the Bradley terminal dates the structure. "1951," I'd pointed out to Kit as we entered the building, "is the same year Faer was born in Rawalpindi." The terminal, we learn from a security agent, now serves only American flights and will soon be torn down. I want to argue that 52 years is hardly old enough for a building to be condemned or a young woman filled with life to die.


   


  As we approach our gate, Faerial's roses begin to work their magic. The pre- flight tension that often fills airport lounges seems to lift. Each time I make eye contact with a passenger or stewardess, a smile greets me as though I'm a bride about to begin a new phase of life. How can I tell them the roses are funereal? I won't, I decide, just as Faerial never let on that she knew she was dying.


   


  Rather, I would like them to know that her life's story is a beautiful one that began Aug. 28, 1951 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. She was the stepdaughter of Katharine Salter Mahmood, wife of the late Sayed Mahmood, a Pakistani military officer. Faerial was a devoted older sister to Kashya Hildebrand and three brothers -- Danny, Timur, and Tariq. More recently, she was the much-loved Auntie Petunia of a 3-year-old niece Natalia who she affectionately called Sweet Pea.


   


  Following her Pakistani father's death in the mid-1960s, Faerial arrived with her American stepmother, Kate, and four siblings to begin life anew in Hamden, Conn. For Kashya, Timur and Danny, Faerial became a second mother. For Kate, she remained a life-long companion and devoted daughter, sharing tea and biscuits early in the morning as had been their custom in their earlier life in Pakistan. As her younger sister and brothers grew into their new surroundings, Faerial saw to it that candles were always burning at meals, especially on occasions when her Pakistani chicken curry was being served.


   


  Faer's shared her Pakistani Chicken Curry recipe with me when I first met her in the summer of 1977. Cooking from memory, she made it with a dash of this and a pinch of that, guaranteeing that the outcome was always a slightly new experience. What never changed was its sensory impact on everyone who entered the kitchen as the pieces of chicken slowly simmered in ground cumin, turmeric and cardamom until the meat fell away from the bones.


   


  On that first visit to the Mahmood homestead that Kate called Halcyon, I noticed Faerial's citizenship certificate hanging on a wall in the kitchen. With twigs and buttons and fabric, a family friend had made a stick figure of a girl and glued it to a poem that had been tucked into the frame with Faerial's citizenship certificate.


   


  At the visitation before her funeral, the certificate and poem -- now brown with age -- were displayed along with photographic collages from Faer's life. Nearby there was an enormous bouquet of 52 ivory white roses interspersed with silver dollar eucalyptus leaves, a small basket of petunias and sweetpeas, and bodacious bouquets of pink roses. The poem left us all smiling through tears--


   


  "There once was a girl named Faer,


   


  Whose skinny legs were her worst nightmare;


   


  But she could cook to a tee,


   


  And a nurse she would be,


   


  Now she's as American as pie, I declare!"


   


  Indeed, Faerial did become a nurse, and had a career at Yale New Haven Hospital that spanned three decades. "An accomplished caregiver," her obituary reads, "she will be best remembered for her colorful, vibrant character and the valiant and unassuming way she met with her two-year bout with cancer. Her unique and charming presence will be missed by all who knew her."


   


  Following Faerial's funeral service, family and friends plucked armfuls of roses from the bouquets that surrounded her pewter urn and drove to Spruce Bank Road where Faer and her mother Kate loved to walk. There, along a quiet stream bank lined with ancient oaks and native spruces, her ashes were scattered with roses into the clear, fast moving waters at a bend in the creek.


   


  Home again, a votive candle burns next to a vase of Faerial's pink roses. And, as if to lift our spirits, October has arrived with brilliant morning light following a night of cold September rain.


   


  Death is not extinguishing the light; it is putting out the lamp because the dawn has come. (Rabindranath Tagore)

Should Northern Virginia public-school students be back in class, rather than trying their best to learn “virtually”?


  The two candidates for the 8th District U.S. House of Representatives are in agreement on generalities, but seem to differ on the emphasis they place on a return to in-person instruction.


  Long-shot Republican challenger Jeff Jordan used a Sept. 23 debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters of the Fairfax Area to press for a return to school, citing a host of reasons.


  “Our children are suffering academically, socially, intellectually across the board,” Jordan said during the 90-minute forum, held “virtually” due to the pandemic.


  “Our teachers are in the same box,” Jordan said. After a lifetime of learning to excel in front of a class, they have become “Zoom monitors,” he said.


  Incumbent U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (D-8th) was in agreement with the principle of students’ returning, but he was more cautious.


  “We all want our kids back in class, but we want them back in school safely,” said Beyer, pushing for federal funds to provide masks, testing and cleaning supplies.

This week's 50-for-50 profile Scott Fry is a man with too much time on his hands right now.


  As a football player and then a coach for closing in on four decades, Scott is used to having his nose in a playbook or watching endless loops of game film at this time of the year. But things are different right now for the 52-year-old. Plymouth South's athletic director for 16 years now, Scott stepped down as football coach at the end of the 2019 season in order to spend more time with his family.


  "My son Cooper is at the age when he's getting into sports and I want to be there and be involved," Scott said. "I've had the chance to coach other people's children for many years and I don't want to miss the chance to coach my own. These are the times that I do not want to miss."


  Fry was ready to scratch his coaching itch this fall as the defensive coordinator for Plymouth South on new Head Coach Darren Fruzzetti's staff, but that was put on hold when football was moved to the new Fall II season because of COVID-19 precautions. That season will now start at the end of February.


  "Yeah, it's a little different right now. It feels kind of weird not being on the football field every afternoon after school or studying up and researching our next opponent," Scott said earlier this week. "I think it will really sink in when we start practicing again during the new Fall II season."


  For as long as Scott can remember he has been around a football field. He started playing in the town's youth program and quickly found that he had some talent for the game that would lead him to star first at Plymouth-Carver and then eventually for Springfield College.


  "As I got older I realized that coaching was something that I wanted to get into once my playing days were over. It seemed like a natural progression for me after having so many great youth coaches growing up and then Paul Coffin as well as Carl Freyermuth once I got to the high school," Scott explained. "They all had a big influence on me as I was growing up."


  He took to the early coaching very well and he was ready to contribute right away when he got to high school. The Plymouth-Carver football program was thriving in the 1980s with more than 100 players in the program each year, but Scott quickly carved out a spot for himself as a sophomore starter on both sides of the football, at linebacker and fullback.


  "The program was having a lot of success at the time. I think we lost three games in the four years I played for Plymouth-Carver," Scott remembered fondly. "There were some talented players on the team like Paul Shea, Dave Enos, Cabby Brini and Jack Quinlan, and we all just seemed to jell together at the right time."


  Fry was one of those talented pieces to the overall puzzle, according to Freyermuth, his high school head football coach.


  "Scott always had great football instincts and he was very mature for his age which allowed him to step in and start as a sophomore at linebacker," Freyermuth said. "He would throw himself into the playbook and the scouting reports more than anyone I've ever seen. He knew those reports better than I did and I was the head coach of the team. He knew his responsibilities on every play and he also knew what everyone else was supposed to be.


  "Even back then Scott was a student of the game and his work ethic was far above and beyond what you'd expect in a player."


  Scott was on P-C's freshman football squad his first year in 1983 and he watched the varsity team put together an undefeated season but they missed moving on to play for a state championship by a hair.


  But 1984 would be a different story.


  Plymouth-Carver rolled to their second Old Colony League title in a row. With Scott moving in as a starting outside linebacker the Blue Eagles made it over the final hurdle and got to the Division 2 state title game, beating Methuen, 18-14, for the program's first state championship.


  "Scott was a big reason we won that game," Freyermuth said. "Methuen had a good drive going deep in our territory when Scott stopped it with a huge interception. It was the defensive play of the game for us."


  Scott was determined to play in college and he found the right fit for football and a future teaching career at Springfield College. "(Springfield coaches) Mike DeLong and Jack Holick were both huge influences on me," Scott said.


  Fry remained with Springfield football program after graduating as a graduate assistant and had coaching stops at Princeton, Maine Maritime, Silver Lake and Plymouth North before taking over as head coach of the Plymouth South program, a position he held for 16 years until stepping down in January.


  During his tenure as head coach he led the Panthers to two Super Bowl appearances in 2013 and then again in 2019. Brendan Harty was a senior captain and two-way starting lineman on the South '13 team that lost in the state finals to Tewksbury.


  "What I remember about that that time is how well Coach Fry had us prepared for every game," Harty said. "So many players from that team went on to play in college and a lot of that was because of the way Scott prepared us for every game. He allowed us to get the most out of all of our talent."


  Plymouth South was back at the Super Bowl again last fall, losing to a very good Methuen High squad at Gillette Stadium in the championship game.


  While he's stepped down as head football coach, Scott is still the athletic director at Plymouth South and he has no plans of moving away from that spot anytime soon.


  "I really enjoy the job of athletic director. You always have challenges like EEE, heat index and now COVID-19 precautions to deal with, but those are the kind of things that go along with the job," Scott said. "I like that I'm still involved in coaching but now it's more along the lines of coaching the coaches.


  "I love talking with coaches and seeing how they go about working with the kids and doing their job."


  Former Plymouth South Athletic Director Karl Braun said Scott is an example of "good things happening to good people."


  "When I was the athletic director Scott shadowed me for more than a year to soak in all that he could about the job. He wanted to coach and do the AD job because he likes helping kids and that's something that hasn't stopped to this day," Braun said. "There are no short cuts with Scott. He does things the right way and he's always put the best interests of the kids first. Always."

President Trump was administered dexamethasone therapy for COVID-19 treatment, and had two episodes of low oxygen saturation levels that required supplemental oxygen, said doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center at a press conference on Sunday.In response to transient low oxygen levels, we did initiate dexamethasone therapy [and] our plan is to continue that for the time being, said Brian Garibaldi, MD, of Johns Hopkins University. He also confirmed the president received his second dose of remdesivir.White House physician Sean Conley, DO, said the team debated on whether or not to start dexamethasone, but added, the potential benefits probably outweighed any risk at this time.Dexamethasone is a low-cost steroid that has shown the most benefit for the sickest patients with COVID-19. According to the U.K.'s RECOVERY trial, incidence of mortality was significantly lower for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and those receiving supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation, but there was no significant benefit for those not receiving respiratory support.The NIH currently recommends dexamethasone for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.Doctors also said the president was receiving X-rays and CT scans. When asked by reporters if there were signs of pneumonia, lung involvement or damage to the lungs, Conley said there were some, expected findings, but nothing of any clinical concern.Conley confirmed that President Trump's oxygen levels dropped to 93%, that he did receive supplemental oxygen on Friday for about an hour, though he continued to stress it wasn't in the low 80s or anything like that.When pressed about the two incidences of a drop in oxygen levels, Conley said he would have to check with the nursing staff about the second round of supplemental oxygen.If he did [receive it], it was very limited, he said.After he was asked if the president's oxygen levels ever dipped below 90%, Conley responded, we don't have any records here of that. He described President Trump's current oxygen levels at 98%.Conley also confirmed the president had a momentary episode of high fever and temporary drop in [oxygen] saturation on Friday, which prompted the medical team to move him to Walter Reed.Garibaldi said the president's liver and kidney function remain normal. Conley said that like every patient, lung spirometry was performed on President Trump and it was over 2,500 ml each time.When asked if the president is being treated in a negative pressure room, Conley maintained he was not going to get into specifics of care.The hope is for President Trump to be discharged to the White House as early as tomorrow where he can continue his treatment course, Garibaldi noted.

The Election Commission of India on Monday held its first hybrid, that is virtual and in-person, meeting with over 700 general, police and expenditure observers across nearly 120 locations, to discuss the upcoming polls and bypolls. The meeting was attended by chief election commissioner Sunil Arora and election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar. The elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly, the first big state polls since the outbreak of coronavirus, will commence on October 28. Additionally, 56 assembly and one parliamentary by-election will also be held in November.The commission has already issued guidelines to ensure Covid safety, the most recent being the decision to send booth-level-officers to the houses of elderly (over 80 years) and differently abled voters (PWD), to see if they would want to cast their vote via postal ballot.In a statement issued regarding the observers' meeting on Monday, the EC said Arora gave a perspective on the impact of Covid-19 on election schedules globally and the detailed deliberation and assessments done by the poll body before taking the decision to conduct elections in Bihar."He underscored the need to be extra careful as this election will be keenly watched by the world community as it is the largest election in the world to be held amid the pandemic. He reiterated the EC's commitment to conduct an election that is free, fair, transparent, ethical and also Covid safe. He stated that the strength of a democracy rests in its primary stakeholder- the voter," the statement added. Arora also said that all efforts must be made to 'instill confidence in the voter to come to the polling station on election day to cast her/his vote safely and freely'. "Two Special Expenditure Observers have already been appointed by the Commission and if required other such Special Observers would also be appointed as the election process progresses," the statement added. The two special observers were appointed on Sunday, barely a day after the poll body visited Bihar and sacked its excise commissioner for 'inadequate preparedness'. The special observers will keep watch on all monetary matters related to the polls, including distribution of incentives such as alcohol and cash for votes. Commissioner Chandra advised officers to pro-actively redress complaints and ensure impartiality while discharging their duties, added the EC statement. Another commissioner Kumar said the officers should always bear in mind they are the actual face of the EC on ground. ECI secretary-general Umesh Sinha specifically briefed the officers on election planning, while deputy election commissioner Dharmendra Sharma spoke about the training process already conducted for the polling personnel. DEC Sudeep Jain highlighted EVM, VVPAT management and electoral roll issues, with his colleague Chandra Bhushan Kumar spoke about legal provisions, Model Code of Conduct issues specifically in Covid scenario for Bihar elections."DEC Ashish Kundra briefed the observers on the specific IT applications… each of the sessions laid emphasis on the extra dimension of Covid-safe election and the broad guidelines issued by the Commission," the EC said.

I’m happy to read that the IR editorial board is encouraging the county commissioners to slow down on coming to a decision about zoning in the valley. However, I disagree with their suggestion that the committee be made up, in part, by representatives from real estate, construction and banking industries. The reason I disagree is that, let’s face it, developers want to develop. How about if we include some representatives from the Open Space Bond Board, PPLT, and NRDC? How about some Permaculture designers who are versed in regenerative land practices?


  I understand the need and desire for landowners in the valley to have the opportunity to make money with their property. But perhaps there are other ways for that to happen aside from subdividing and building more homes. I believe that there are win-win ideas out there waiting to be developed. Let’s really think outside the box here and look to the future with the effects of climate change in mind. How many people can the Prickly Pear Valley - including the city of Helena - truly support in terms of water? What if we see sustained drought? The IR is correct that we need to take the time to get this right. We don’t want to look back and say we wish we done things differently.

Considering this happened when Nick Foles made his starting debut, it's easy to wonder if it's possible what they've done with their offense to accomodate Mitchell Trubisky's mobility in the running game has made it so Foles can't be successful.


  Bootleg passes and the threat of a mobile quarterback running helped make the running attack work in the first three games by spreading out the defensive front more. Without this threat the defense focused attention entirely at disrupting the point of attack.


  The Bears had made the offense to work with play-action and to move the quarterback. Trubisky's ability to scramble or run off the edge in zone-read situations had been a threat to keep defenses honest.


  Sunday, it appeared the Colts simply teed off, disregarding play-action and made it rough for Foles to complete passes.


  This one may require Bears coaches to go back to the drawing board and fast before their Thursday night date with Tom Brady.


  Is it too late to revert back to the shotgun approach of last year? Foles might be more comfortable in this. Or perhaps is it too late to go back to Trubisky?


  Here are the Bears' grades for Week 4,
