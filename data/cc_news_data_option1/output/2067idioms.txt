As a lecturer in business leadership, I’m particularly interested in the value of authenticity in the workplace. Part of my research (with colleagues Steven Grover and Stephen Teo) has involved surveying more than 800 workers across Australia to find out how the behaviour of their leaders shapes their feelings about work.

The 14nm shortages are also confusing. Did they have to convert a bunch of 14nm capacity to 10 to get this far on Ice? Some mysterious issue with their operations/execution they're keeping totally silent about? I'd also offer bad market forecasting as a guess, but shortages have gone on too long for it to just be forecasting.

In hindsight, Abrams sees it as a silver lining to a terribly dark cloud, because the press that the film received ahead of Sundance when Winfrey pulled out generated a tremendous amount of interest and anticipation. "I think the most important thing that she did was to say that she believes the survivors, and had that not been the case, I might feel differently," she said.

"Six episodes in, I'm sitting there and making small talk with Venus Williams like you would at any job," said Karmel. "It's one of those things where every once in a while you have to slap yourself and say you're sitting with two of the greatest athletes of all-time. Working with Gronk is crazy because he is a giant 6'6″ Labrador Retriever puppy. He is so sweet and so funny and so excited to do everything. Venus was game to do everything like walk on a tight rope and do upside down sit-ups."

It was another big week for Jordan's Ben Kelvington.
 Kelvington earned two prestigious awards this past week for his exploits on and off the wrestling mat for Augustana University.
 First, Kelvington was awarded the prestigious NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship on Monday, May 18.
 The NCAA awards up to 126 postgraduate scholarships annually to student- athletes who excel academically and athletically and who are at least in their final year of intercollegiate athletics competition. The one-time $10,000 award is given three times a year, corresponding to each sport season (fall, winter and spring).
 Kelvington, the NCAA Elite 90 winner and NSIC Elite 18 winner for holding the highest GPA at each championship event, was nominated by Dr. Marcia Entwistle, the Augustana faculty athletics representative (FAR).
 "Ben exemplifies what it means to be an Augustana student-athlete," Dr. Entwistle said. "Ben is a gifted athlete, talented scientific researcher, and impactful leader."
 Kelvington is the 38th Postgraduate Scholar for Augustana all-time and is the 13th awardee since 2010. He is also the 10th Augustana wrestler to earn the award and the sixth under head coach Jason Reitmeier.
 "I am really proud of Ben," Reitmeier said. "It has been a storybook year for him, earning All-America honors, becoming a national qualifier, earning the Elite 90 award along with All-NSIC and NWCA academic honors.
 "He has done it all this year, and I am not surprised he won this award, too."

LOUISVILLE, Ky., (WDRB) – A Louisville Metro Police officer has been charged with sexual abuse and harassment for allegedly tying a woman’s hands behind her back, groping and kissing her during multiple trips to her place of employment.
 Officer Robert Neff has been charged with three counts of official misconduct, two charges of third-degree sexual abuse and harassment with physical conduct. The charges are all misdemeanors and Neff was not arrested.
 Neff, 25, is accused of going to a Thornton’s gas station on Taylor Blvd. multiple times in March while on duty and harassing and sexually abusing a female employee. The woman is identified only by her initials in the complaint.
 Attorney Steven Schroering, who is representing Neff, said his client would plead not guilty when he is arraigned next month but declined further comment.
 On March 10, Neff allegedly went to the Thornton’s and “tied victim’s hands behind her back with plastic,” according to a police citation. He untied her with a knife when she pulled away, according to the report.
 Later that day, Neff came back, followed the woman into the backroom of the gas station and gave her a hug and kiss, “both of which were unwanted by the victim,” police said.
 The officer was in the store nearly two hours while on duty that day.
 The next day, Neff returned and told the woman he wanted to be in a relationship with her, according to the police report. When she said she wasn’t interested, the officer told her he wanted a kiss.
 Later that day, the officer again followed the woman into a backroom of the business and “under the guise of performing a search … touched (her) chest area with both hands,” police allege.
 While the woman continued to work and try to avoid Neff, he followed her around the store, speaking with her and other employees for about 45 minutes, police say.
 He then followed her into the backroom again and performed another “search,” where he put his hand under her shirt, grabbed her bra and shook it and ran his hand up the inside of both her legs, according to the police report.
 When Neff asked the woman to take a shoe and sock off, she refused. After briefly taking her shoe, Neff left the store. He had been there more than two hours, according to police.
 The alleged victim reported the incident to another police officer.
 Sgt. Lamont Washington, a spokesman for the department, said "an investigation was conducted by LMPD’s Public Integrity Unit after concerns were brought to a supervisor from someone inside the department."
 Neff, who is assigned to the 6th Division, was placed on administrative reassignment on March 23. The case is under internal review by the police department.
 Neff is scheduled to be arraigned on June 16.

But as an immense number of initial claims inundated the system -- the number of weekly claims topped 180,000, compared to a typical average of around 6,000 -- that balance was hard to come by. Some 2 million initial claims have been filed in Washington since the first week in March, and the state has paid $3.8 billion in benefits since then.

Nolan may revel in "Tenet" serving as the hero riding to the rescue of the theatrical experience; his studio may wish for a less stressful set of circumstances. If Warners were to delay the film, it would be a body blow to theaters. But changing much closer to the date, or opening to disappointing results, might hurt more for the larger picture.

The documentary was a subject of controversy when it lost Oprah Winfrey as its executive producer ahead of its Sundance premiere because the mogul felt it needed more reporting. Winfrey's exit was disappointing and deeply worrying for Dixon, Abrams and Sher, because the film not only lost the support of a very powerful figure, but also lost its distributor, Apple TV+. The idea that the film might not see the light of day was terrifying.
