We try to go into the plays that we have both in the run game and in the pass game that we think are appropriate to attack a particular defense. We have a long way to go offensively, we all know that. We have to get better running it, get better throwing it. Some of those “deceptives” that you are referring to, when they fit into the plan, we’ll certainly use them going forward.

¡Es ‘The Special One’! José Mourinho siempre está en los ojos del mundo, y esta vez tuvo un gesto con un periodista que emocionó a todos. El técnico del Tottenham se emocionó con el relato y el pedido del profesional macedonio antes de jugar contra KF Shkendija de ese país por la Liga de Europa. “Cuando mi padre ya estaba muy enfermo, me dijo que te pidiera una foto si alguna vez tenía la oportunidad de verte,  porque me crió fijándose en ti. Si me lo permites y tu equipo gana, la enmarcaré y la pondré en el lugar de su descanso eterno”, le dijo Igor Aleksandrovic al técnico portugués. Rápidamente José Mourinho accedió a la petición con un mensaje emocionante. “La foto no tiene nada que ver con el resultado. Eso está hecho. Si puedes venir al hotel antes del partido, quizás sea más fácil. Si no después. El placer será mío, un honor y mi respeto a tu padre. Si eso sentía hacia mí, no lo merezco, pero lo agradezco”, dijo el entrenador. El encuentro se dio en el hotel de concentración de los ‘spurs’ y el periodista no cabía en su emoción. “Mi padre falleció de cáncer hace poco, se quedó sin voz. Ya no podíamos comentar los partidos. Cuando vi a Mourinho fue increíble y emocionante. La foto la colocaré en la tumba de mi padre Zoran”, contó Igor a la cadena Deportes Cuatro. En el hotel, ‘The Special One’ e Igor Aleksandrovic se encontraron, charlaron por cinco minutos y llegó al esperada foto que el mismo Tottenham difundió en sus redes sociales. “Muchas gracias Mourinho”, dijo el profesional en español cuando fue entrevistado por este momento que nunca olvidará.

Now Pelosi's quiver of poison darts in case their stuffed ballot box scheme doesn't pan out. Why can't they just run a fair game, and accept the results? Is it because the globalist elites are impatient to start their world government? And the left is the best medium to implement their changes like gun confiscation in the U.S., complete control, censoring of free thought,expression? They say a world government will be based on a socialist platform, and us deplorables are standing in the way of their plans. Lets hope they're set back a decade or two.

A: They’re an excellent defense for a lot of different reasons. They’re really stout up front, they’re disruptive in the running game and obviously can get after the quarterback. Their backers run well and their secondary is awfully good. It all fits together. They believe in their scheme and they play it really well. Another part of playing that is they don’t give you a whole lot of stuff. They certainly don’t give you a lot of big plays. Against a defense like this, you certainly look for ways to make big plays. The correlation between making explosive plays in a drive and scoring is pretty high in this league. When you don’t make them, it’s much more difficult. I think we’ve done a pretty good job over the first couple of weeks of having some long drives. You have to mix in some explosive plays within those drives. That’s how you score points in this league. We’re always finding ways to do that. This week could be another challenge against an excellent defense.

A: I think you’re always trying to do that. You have an offensive system that’s flexible enough to adapt to different situations that you have. If you have a player you want to feature either in the running game or the passing game, you have to be to able to do that seamlessly within your system. We believe we have a system that allows us to do that. In Week 1, we didn’t have Golden, so we used more three tight end type sets to try to take advantage of some looks in Pittsburgh. Last week, you try to do some different things against Chicago with the guys you have available to you. You’re always doing that, you’re always evaluating who you have, who you’re going against and what you want to do. Hopefully your system is flexible enough to do that. Obviously, Saquon is a great, great football player and really impactful player both in the run game and the passing game throughout his career. He was going to be a big part of what we wanted to do this year. Now we have to adjust. Again, we feel confident in the guys we have behind him in Dion and Wayne and now Devonta. Give those guys opportunities both in the run game and the pass game from that running back position. Also get some other guys involved in the passing game to help us try to move the ball and score some points. Pittsburgh was a really good defense. Chicago, really good defense. San Francisco, really good defense. We’re going to play really good defenses all year long. We have kind of keep figuring it out, keep growing day by day and week by week.

How many people will we allow to die without a national response to the COVID-19 virus? How long will we care about the economy over actual American lives? I pose these questions to Bill Huizenga, our current congressman, and our local state office holders.
   
 In recent weeks, it has become crystal clear that these men are supportive of the re-election of Donald Trump. It is equally clear that keeping our economy moving is their highest priority, regardless of the death toll.
   
 Bill Huizenga is under investigation by the bipartisan House Ethics Committee for Disney trips with his family that were financed by his campaign fund. Simply put, these "expenses" break the laws of this nation.
   
 In 1992, our congressional district elected Peter Hoekstra to Congress over incumbent Guy VanderJagt because he had taken a single trip to the Caribbean that was paid by lobbyists. Our community thought this was wrong, and Hoekstra beat our 12-term congressman by six points. Apparently, integrity mattered to us in 1992, but does it still?
   
 Several years ago, I was blocked from Huizenga's Facebook page for challenging his outlandish lies. I, too, attended Christian schools and Calvin University, spending three weeks with Bill in Eastern Europe in January 1989. His supposed concern for law and order, his supposed concern for fiscal responsibility all faded when Trump was elected.
   
 We have 200,000 dead Americans due to our reckless leadership, and we still have no national policy to fight this virus. We have better options on our ballot this coming November, people with lifetimes of integrity. It is past time that we care for American lives and set aside our party politics.

In addition to having fewer face-to-face interactions over the past six months, the pandemic has also intensified many existing issues in Indian Country, from health inequalities and socioeconomic challenges to the lack of basic infrastructure in many of our tribal communities. The decisions that are made by our elected representatives directly impact our ability to respond to these challenges and address these issues in the long term. While we appreciate the federal government’s investment in Indian Country during this time of crisis, we have also encountered many challenges with the deployment of these resources.
 Many of these challenges were created by a lack of understanding and education about tribal issues from our elected leaders. As Native people, it’s important that we hold these leaders accountable and ensure that they are aware of the issues that impact our communities. The most direct way of doing this is at the ballot box.

“The positives are we moved the ball well against a very sound defense. The negatives we aren’t scoring once we are I. The red zone. The past two weeks we have been in the red zone eight times and came up empty. We have to work on being more mentally tough and willing our way into the end zone. This week is another tough opponent and we have a ton of injuries. We need to heal up and play solid four quarters of football.”
 The Eagles are 2-0 entering Friday’s game while averaging close to 300 yards of offense per game. They are led by tailbacks Zane Wickliffe and Ladarion Montgomery. Wick life has ran for 257 yards and two touchdowns while Montgomery has totaled 131 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Quarterback Cooper Stone has thrown for 194 yards and one touchdown while completing 11-of-35 pass attempts.
 “Bethlehem has a ton of athletes all over the field,” Harris said. “We have to be able to match up with them to compete so we are going on have to move some folks around this week.

We can’t afford that, we need to establish momentum early and not let our foot off of the gas.”

A: I think it’s important for players to learn from each other’s experiences. It doesn’t have to be somebody who specifically went through a system with me, or someone from the same tree as me. I think it’s just important that people learn from their own experiences, but also sharing each other’s experiences. Look, it’s a long season. We have a long way to go. It doesn’t matter what the record is. There’s a lot of improvement that has to be made across the board. Logan is definitely a respected guy in our locker room because of how he works, by how he prepares himself, and about how he holds himself. The benefit of having Logan here more than anything else is he’s a really good player for us. That’s the number one benefit. Number two, he’s a really good teammate. He’s helped with the communication on the backend, and he’s really helped bring along a lot of guys with him because he’s just that kind of a veteran player. He’s done a really good job in preparing himself and making sure we prepare as a group and as a unit, and that’s really benefited the team. Personally, I love having Logan around here. He’s fun to be around. I’ve known him since he came into the league. He’s known me since I’ve been a very young coach. We kind of grew up in a lot of ways together, figuring things out and certain things working on special teams at some point. But Logan is a guy that’s great to have on the practice field, he’s great to have in the games. He’s gone through a tremendous amount of adversity. He’s come out on both ends at different times. This is a guy, his experiences in Tennessee with going into a new program with Mike (Vrabel) and putting together a program that took a little bit of time to get rolling but eventually it paid off and they’re still moving in the right direction right now. What he went through in maybe New England through different phases of his career there. He has a lot of experience to lean on and share with other teammates. But really, all that’s truly relevant for this team is what we do here. We can learn from the experiences in the past, we have to learn from what happened in the last two games, but we have to take those experiences, learn from them and move forward to make them beneficial going forward for our team.
