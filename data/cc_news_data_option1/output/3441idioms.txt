But it's not the powertrain that validates the Chevy SS to enthusiasts and family haulers alike. Rather, it's the chassis -- MacPherson struts up front and a multilink arrangement in the rear -- that deserves attention. Sure, these are essentially the same hard parts that have been around for the better part of the last decade in various Australian and American models. But here they've been retuned specifically for hard-charging-sedan-loving Aussies.

MARSHFIELD -- Horse racing, which became a major event at the Marshfield Fair shortly after World War II, is long gone, but for many, the memories of the thundering herd pounding around the half-mile bullring track linger. They always seem to surface at this time of year.


  "I had an uncle who came down from Boston on the weekends of the fair and he loved to play the ponies," said Bill Frugoli, 88, who went to the fair when he was a child.


  Frugoli, auditor for the Marshfield Agricultural and Horticultural Society, the nonprofit that operates the fair, has many warm memories of days spent in the grandstand watching the races with his uncle.


  "He always bet on the gray horses," Frugoli said, laughing as he remembers how overwhelmed the man was when, during one race, every horse was gray.


  Be it horses, Model-A Fords, or Brockton-built Marsh and Metz motorcycles, racing was a fixture in Marshfield since the fair opened in 1867. In 1912, Thomas Lawson built a track and grandstand. In 1934, pari-mutuelgambling was legalized in the state and it was off to the races.


  Even though he was too young to gamble, Frugoli and his friends would always find a sympathetic adult to place a bet for them.


  "We never won big money," he said. "We might have won 20 cents in the end."


  The fair's 10-day mid-August meet was a loosely run operation, a sort of mom- and-pop affair. Frugoli said horses that lost were often given away at the end of the meet. One man even "claimed a few" for his daughter.


  "I was a little tyke, but I remember being able to go horseback riding on one of those horses," he said. "The story that went around was, don't ring a bell when you're riding or it'll take off."


  Carleton Chandler, longtime secretary of the fair, said horse racing in Marshfield was part of a circuit with the other fairs in Massachusetts, including Weymouth, Brockton, Great Barrington and Northampton.


  "It was a whole different crowd," Chandler said. "In Marshfield, it was great, you had people come down from Boston, the metro area, and rent houses for the week or two weeks of the fair and bring the whole family down. It was like a vacation for them."


  Kids would hit the midway while the grownups tried their luck at the betting window.


  The fair runs in the Chandler family's blood. Carleton's father, Russell, moved to Marshfield in 1938 and became the fairgrounds' announcer the next year, using equipment from his radio shop. He was perhaps best-known for calling the horse races from the infield, a duty he took on in 1961 and kept for 26 years. Carleton Chandler worked alongside his father and others to orchestrate the event.


  Lenny LaForest, a retired Marshfield police sergeant and president of the Marshfield Agricultural and Horticultural Society, first started working at the fair in the late 1950s. He swept floors that were littered with losing betting slips, and worked the beer stand alongside Chandler.


  "People still tell me, 'I remember going to see the horses,'" he said.


  One particular Sunday is etched in LaForest's memory. Trotters were coming around the first turn and one horse bumped into another as the jockey was holding the reins in the sulky, a two-wheeled cart.


  "All of the sudden, the horse and the jockey and the carriage are all over the inside rail," he said. "The horse was spooked."


  Cars were all parked on the infield oval surrounded by the track.


  "The horse and the carriage went down through all the cars, just bouncing through," LaForest said. "They must have gotten two-thirds of the way through when the horse went upside-down between a couple of cars. The best part about it was they got the horse out. The horse was fine, and the carriage was a little worse for wear. The jockey was fine too."


  To many who grew up on the South Shore, horse racing at the Marshfield Fair marked the end of the summer. It was the place to gather to have one last blast before fall set in and the kids went back to school.


  The Marshfield races had history and personality. Photo-finish prints, fastened to a wire, were sent past the heads of bettors from the top of the grandstand to the steward's stand on the opposite side of the track. The jockeys and the trainers at Marshfield were either youngsters on their way up or veterans on their way down. After a race, the jockeys had to walk through a crowd of race fans who critiqued their ride in colorful language.


  Racing ended at Marshfield in 1991 after a conflict with the newly opened track in Foxborough. The state racing commission awarded Marshfield's dates to Foxborough and moved Marshfield's meet back two weeks. Such a move would have been a potential killer for Marshfield because the fair would have found it hard to survive with the kids back in school. The result was a fatal blow to racing at Marshfield.


  Losing horse racing's seven hours of daily entertainment forced Marshfield Fair to reinvent itself. Instead of a 10-race card each day, it now features demolition derbies, stunt shows, brightly colored midway games, thrilling carnival rides, agricultural exhibits, 4-H shows, rodeo events and a blues music festival. The fair typically draws about 150,000 people over 10 days to its grounds off Route 3A. However, this year's Marshfield Fair has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.


  "We've been able to transform ourselves," Chandler said. "With our strong agriculture presence, it's worked out very good for us. That part has been very positive."


  Between the stables, track, grandstand and jockey area, the infrastructure required to pull off the sport of kings took up half of the space on the fairgrounds, Chandler said.


  Now that the fair has regained all that acreage, Chandler said he isn't sure what he would do without it.


  "Now looking back, I wonder how we put the fair on when we didn't have any of this room," Chandler said.

It certainly hasn't been the gentlest of introductions to a Tour de France, and while many expect a sprint at the end of the day, this is far from one of those flat opening-week processions.


  The opening half of the stage looks like a proper slog, with the Col du Pilon and Col de la Faye coming together and the road continuing to rise thereafter. The Col des Legues will put the sprinters in more trouble again, but what swings this back in their favour are the 70 or so lightly downhill kilometres ahead of the run-in to Sisteron. It should be enough ground for some organised teams to bring about a bunch gallop, but it will again be one contested with fatigued legs.

In government crash tests, the Suburban received four out of five stars for overall crash protection, with five stars for both overall frontal and side protection. The lower overall total score is due to the Suburban's rollover rating. In Edmunds brake testing, a Suburban stopped from 60 mph in 145 feet, a long distance for an SUV.


  ## Driving


  From behind the wheel, the 2013 Chevrolet Suburban feels surprisingly civilized for a truck that tips the scales at 3 tons. The 5.3-liter V8 delivers good acceleration with a light load, though performance with a full complement of passengers and cargo or towing a large trailer is just adequate. The 2500 model is obviously the more robust choice, and if you're looking for the Suburban to make good on its massive family-hauler potential, the bigger engine is definitely the way to go.

  # Four people rescued in Lake Winnebago after boat took on water, no one injured


  Benita Mathew


  Fond du Lac Reporter


  FOND DU LAC - Four people were rescued after a boat took on water on Lake Winnebago on Saturday afternoon.


  The Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Office responded to a distress call around 4:30 p.m. from a boat on Lake Winnebago about a mile away from the lighthouse on Saturday. Someone was reported to be in the water.


  A 50-year-old Fond du Lac resident's boat took on the water because of heavy winds and waves, according to the sheriff's office. Four people on the boat panicked and jumped out to try to keep the boat afloat. Some of the passengers used personal flotation devices and the others received one from officers.


  A DNR warden made contact with a person in the water and brought them on board. The sheriff's office also saved three other people from the water.


  No one was injured in the incident. The boat was towed back to the Fond du Lac harbor.

The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that states are empowered to make special provisions for reservation of seats for in-service doctors in postgraduate medical courses, PTI reported.


  A five-judge Constitution bench comprising of Justices Arun Mishra, Vineet Saran, Indira Banerjee, MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose said that the Medical Council of India is a statutory body and has no power to make provisions for reservations. The MCI’s regulation that barred such reservation is arbitrary and unconstitutional, the court said.


  The judges suggested that states may ask beneficiaries of the quota to serve in rural, tribal or hilly areas for five years and also clarified that the judgement will apply only for future admissions, according to _Live Law_.


  The admission to postgraduate degree courses are conducted through the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test and 50% seats are filled through all India quota and the remaining 50% from state quota.


  Tamil Nadu Medical Officers Association and others had filed a petition, saying that granting reservation benefits would encourage those working in government hospitals and in rural areas. They challenged the validity of the Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, framed by the MCI. The in- service candidates said that they work round the clock for the benefit of the public and cannot find time to update their knowledge and compete with the general candidates.


  However, the Centre and the medical body had opposed the petition. They argued that granting reservations or a separate source of entry for in-service candidates would directly impinge on the authority of MCI to coordinate and determine standards of medical education.

ASHBURN, Va. — In the last intense practice of training camp, the one Coach Ron Rivera hyped as important for filling out his 53-man roster, the Washington Football Team did not scrimmage. It did not “go live” by tackling to the ground. It ran situational tests — red zone, special teams — and played a little more physical than it recently had.


  Sunday’s practice lacked dramatic plays but not tension, which hung over the team as about a dozen of the 80 players fought for their futures. There are “probably seven, maybe eight” roster spots still up for grabs, Rivera said, and to drive home the session’s importance, he called a rare pre-practice team circle.


  “Take advantage,” he told his players. “This is your chance to show us what you can do.”

The Suburban is mechanically identical to the GMC Yukon XL, but GMC's available engine upgrade gives the Yukon XL the ability to deliver stronger performance. The Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia are strong competitors, although both have been in production for 10 years without a comprehensive redesign. For the time being, the 2017 Chevrolet Suburban remains the newest entry in the small class of full-size adventure-style SUVs, yet the GMC and Toyota still achieve higher customer scores.


  Standard safety equipment for all 2017 Chevy Suburbans includes antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control (with trailer sway control), front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. An airbag located between the front bucket seats (when so equipped) offers additional protection in side-impact crashes. Also standard is a teen-driver management system, a reminder to check the backseats for child occupants before vacating the vehicle, rear parking sensors, and a rearview camera. Also standard is the subscription-based OnStar system, which includes automatic crash notification, on-demand roadside assistance, remote door unlocking, stolen vehicle assistance and turn-by-turn navigation.

Six years ago Jim Garman gave his wife, Michelle, a beehive for Christmas to cure her fear of bees. As it turns out, his cheeky gift delivered. What's more, it sparked a passion for the spunky, Newport-based couple that continues to this day.


  "This year, we have nine hives," says Michelle, who runs an 8-acre sustainable farm with Jim in Middletown. "Every year, we get a few more. It's one of those things that you get addicted to and keep growing, growing, growing if you have the space."


  As Tiverton resident Susan Medyn can attest, you don't have to own a farm to keep bees. At current count, she manages 16 hives -- nine in her 1-acre backyard a stone's throw from the Sakonnet River, and seven more at another property nearby.


  She speaks thoughtfully about her seven summers as an amateur beekeeper. Like the Garmans, her passion grew out of a self-imposed challenge.


  "In 2011, I was diagnosed with a nasty form of breast cancer," Medyn explains. "It involved a lot of treatment in chemo and radiation. Afterward, I thought I would do something that would really challenge me. I didn't feel like skydiving was my thing -- I didn't want a one-time thrill. Beekeeping was something that felt possible and, for me, something that felt intimidating."


  Tending to her buzzing flock quickly monopolized Medyn's free time -- not that she has a lot of it. She works as both a clinical social worker and a successful artist.


  She started out with just two hives, but even that proved daunting. "My first week was fraught with unusual experiences. It was really difficult to know what to do," she says. "I installed the bees, and they swarmed two days later. Not having equipment, I put them back in the hive. Of course, swarming means they need another hive, so they swarmed again. Within two more days, there was another swarm from the other hive. All my neighbors were thinking, 'What is she doing?'"


  Medyn and the Garmans aren't the only ones in Newport County feeling the buzz. Whether it's to tune out technology or get back to nature, more and more people are experimenting with backyard beehives.


  Newport resident and bee expert Ed Karle, who owns and runs a training, mentoring and onsite hive support service called Beeviews, says, "There has definitely been an increase in interest and in getting honeybees, across the country, in all states and towns. On average, there are four or more beekeepers of various scales in every town in the U.S. When I started teaching beekeeping in 2008, my bee class had 12 people. Now, the numbers are always over 100."


  When it comes to apiculture, Karle's reach is extensive, stretching into greater Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He teaches classes in beekeeping at Bristol Community College, where he's an adjunct professor, as well as through the Bee School offered by the Rhode Island Beekeepers Association (RIBA) at Rhode Island College.


  "It's very important to go to a beekeeping school offered by a state or county organization," Karle says. "The instructors are local, experienced beekeepers and their knowledge is critical to starting the hobby on a good foundation. Besides taking a formal beekeeping class, new beekeepers should also get a local mentor who can [provide] support."


  Jim Garman agrees that beginners should start to build a knowledge base before jumping in. "RIBA offers a really excellent class that happens in January or February," he says. "I would definitely not recommend just taking this up without even a modicum of learning."


  Adds Michelle, "In addition to taking the class, find some kind of mentor who has been doing this forever and has seen every issue they could possibly see. They can come out and walk you through what's going on with your hive. That's been an invaluable tool."


  Medyn says that by her fifth year with hives she felt like she had just reached kindergarten. "I moved forward, learning more and taking classes, learning more and going to conferences, learning more, reading, asking for help." She currently belongs to three organizations and frequents beekeeping meetings. She also still touches base with her mentor, who happens to be Karle.


  Although the initial time investment in learning can be steep, Karle says that beekeepers only spend about 20 hours total tending to their hives over the course of a full year, and bees are really only active March through December. "Honeybees do not love to see their beekeeper visit and do inspections. Beekeeping is not like a human-dog relationship. What beekeepers need to do is visit their hives for specific reasons or tasks at the right times of the year with the right tools."


  But if you ask Medyn, she'll tell you the experience can be a bit more intensive. "It's time-consuming and involved -- a tremendous amount of work," she says. "It involves trying to anticipate and assess what you're seeing, and to do the proper actions. It can take hours on a beautiful Saturday. But I just love to see what's going on in there."


  If you've got the time and energy to devote and would like to become an apiarist, expect to invest about $600 during the first season. That covers personal gear, a bee kit with bees, hive parts, and annual consumables like sugar and honey bottling supplies.


  One thing you don't necessarily need is a lot of space. To avoid getting stung -- or having your neighbors get stung -- you'll just want to locate your hive in an easy-to-get-to spot that's not in the way of doors, pathways or outdoor activities. You also need sunlight. "It wakes them up," explains Karle. "Bees use the sun to navigate to and from forage sources. The earlier the direct sun, the better."


  Newport County offers a pretty nice environment for beekeeping. "There's a lot of undeveloped land, which allows bees to have a variety of forage," Medyn says. "We're so fortunate that it's not monoculture crop-based or something where there's more challenges. The biggest challenge would be if a farmer or lawn care company didn't abide by appropriate use of pesticides."


  Because of this, honeybees in Newport County are pretty happy -- and happy honeybees don't hang around looking to dive bomb humans. Honeybees typically forage over a three-mile radius from the hive (about 25 square miles) looking for pollen, nectar and water.


  "If the bees are well managed, then they're usually pretty calm," Jim Garman says. "It's generally during the requeening process that you run into trouble."


  Adds Michelle, "The only other time you'd maybe see an aggressive hive would be at night, if raccoons or something else is bothering them, and the bees are super-defensive and alert."


  Keeping bees has not only been a wonderful experience for Medyn and the Garmans, but it has enriched other areas of their lives. For Medyn, it has inspired and informed her artwork in a few ways. "A lot of the work since I've had bees [depicts] bits of honeycomb and bees flying around," she says.


  Medyn also paints her actual hives, using a technique from her Polish heritage. It's the traditional Eastern European process of painting intricate designs on Easter eggs. "This enables me to have hives that are appealing to me," she says. "Also, bees prefer to have a way to identify their own hive. Bees will drift into other hives if, say, they're all white and in a line. They recognize the different colors and patterns on the hive that they should go to."


  Most local beekeepers harvest honey to give as gifts or eat themselves. Others with large hives, like the Garmans and Medyn, sell it. To try out their brands of Newport County honey, look for Medyn's at Coastal Roasters in Tiverton, and the Garmans' through The Green Grocer in Portsmouth, A Market on Bellevue in Newport, and the Jamestown Farmers Market.

Since there is a difference in the way various traditions of the world cooks meat, there was a challenge for the researchers to arrive at a definitive conclusion that is general and sound. Besides, the outcomes of the same dish of red meat in different regions might be influenced by the way the food is prepared. This is very critical to the formation of the cancer-causing constituents, and in light of the fact that different side dishes are eaten with the meat, it may meddle with the potential carcinogenic properties of red meat.

 OTTAWA — The federal Conservatives are calling on WE Charity to release documents the youth organization promised to hand over to a House of Commons committee before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament.
 But WE is pushing back against the Tories' request, with the organization's legal counsel saying it amounts to "politics, not proper process."
 The Tories' request is in a letter sent Sunday from Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre and ethics critic Michael Barrett to Craig and Marc Kielburger, the brothers who co-founded WE more than 20 years ago.
 It's the official Opposition's latest effort to continue digging into the decision to have WE run a multimillion-dollar student-volunteer program, after Trudeau temporarily shuttered several Commons committee investigations by proroguing Parliament on Aug. 18.
 In their letter, Poilievre and Barrett note the Kielburgers and other WE officials committed to provide members of Parliament with answers to several questions they were unable to answer while appearing before the finance committee.
 The finance committee also asked the charity to provide more information about two trips that WE hosted for then-finance minister Bill Morneau and his family to Kenya and Ecuador.

 Female doctors in Canada consistently earn less than their male colleagues because of systemic biases that pervade the medical profession, a new analysis suggests.
 An article published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests that female doctors are underrepresented in top-earning medical specialities and paid less for equivalent work because of structural inequities that follow them throughout their career.
 "Our analysis piece confirms that the gender pay gap exists in Canadian medicine," said Tara Kiran, a family physician and clinician investigator at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.
 Kiran and co-author Dr. Michelle Cohen of Queen's University examined the relationship between the proportion of women in a specialty and average earnings across Canada.
 They found that women account for less than 35 per cent of doctors in the 10 specialities with the highest incomes, including radiology, ophthalmology and cardiology.
 By contrast, female doctors made up roughly half or more of the workforce in lower-paying specialities, such as family medicine, psychiatry and pediatrics.

 VANCOUVER — Marine mammal specialists and whale rescue groups say they're not sure how much fishing gear three entangled humpback whales spotted off the coast of British Columbia are still carrying, leaving experts worried.
 Paul Cottrell, the Pacific marine mammals co-ordinator for the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, says while rescuers managed to get some gear off one of the animals, they are not sure how the other two are faring.
 He says the first whale, known as Checkmate, was spotted last week and has a trap and line running through its mouth. However, because someone had cut off a buoy attached to the gear, Cottrell says rescuers haven't been able to attach a line to the animal and help it.
 He says another yet-to-be-named whale has a fishing net over its head and was last seen more than three weeks ago.
 Cottrell says rescuers managed to remove more than 60 metres of fishing line off a third whale named X-ray, but the animal was also last seen more than three weeks ago so they don't know how it is faring.

For all the laudatory oratory of the virtual Republican convention, the Grand Old Party confessed its total subordination to President Donald Trump in a single non-action. It failed to write a new party platform to guide the next four years, settling for the existing one.


  Nothing spoke more eloquently of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and, yes, the Bushes, than the decision to hew to the status quo of Trump, which unfortunately includes continuing to ignore the huge health pandemic that has wrestled the economy to a standstill, with a toll of some 180,000 American lives and climbing.


  By and large, the GOP convention was little more than an echo chamber of Trump’s boast of having made America great again, with a staged rip-off of the hallowed naturalization process for five new citizens brought to the White House for Trump’s personal endowment.

Yet without games, Rivera acknowledged evaluating special teams is an inexact science.


  “You won’t really know until the young man you decide to keep . . . is out there,” the coach said. “On the first Sunday, you’re going to find out exactly whether or not he has what it takes. Right now, you’ve kind of got an incomplete picture.”


  On offense and defense, Sunday cemented what seemed likely throughout camp. There was noteworthy contact, like when defensive end Chase Young pile-drove running back Adrian Peterson into the dirt, or when defensive tackle Jonathan Allen limped off with a hurt left leg (he’s OK), though most of the position battles seem all but over. Geron Christian at left tackle, Wes Martin at left guard, Troy Apke at free safety, etc. The remaining questions are down the roster at wide receiver, linebacker, cornerback and tight end, and it could include a player such as wideout Isaiah Wright.


  In conversations with Kyle Smith, vice president of player personnel, Rivera said they have mapped out different versions of the roster. This season, Rivera has emphasized that it will be crucial to stay deep at certain positions, though it seems as if Rivera has not decided which positions yet.


  “We’ve got a way to go still,” Rivera said. “We’re in the process of developing this football team. But the process is we have to take a step forward every day. We can’t go backwards.”


  After practice, Rivera seemed excited to review the tape. There were “some things we need to get corrected,” he said, but he praised his players’ effort. The only exception was three series after the “halftime” they simulated in the middle of their practice situations. Rivera thought “there was a little bit of a lull,” which he’d seen before and did not like. He scolded his team for the lack of focus.


  “I just wanted to make a point in those things,” Rivera said.
