Canton City Council has voted unanimously to increase penalties and fines for littering.
 The new rules will increase fines for a first offense from $100 to $150. For a second offense, fines spike from $150 to $500.
 Councilman Frank Morris proposed the changes because he says Canton needs to do a better job keeping the community clean.

Obviously, that entails a significant pricing gap between the Pro and non-Pro models, with the compact iPhone 12 Mini likely to cost as little as $699, the "standard" iPhone 12 (aka Max) expected to start at $799, and the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max purportedly priced at $999 and $1099 respectively in their entry-level configurations.
   
 Speaking of, the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max should start at 128GB storage space and go all the way up to 512 gigs, while the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are rumored to use a downgrade to 64 gigs of local digital hoarding room as another method of cutting costs, capping off at 256GB storage.

 Rightly or wrongly (and to this day I still don't think there's a consensus on the matter) the plan was eventually ditched with Gwynedd Council agreeing to position extra staff along the route to the school.
 It's worth mentioning that a lot of people - parents, school governors and others - were in favour of the proposal as it would enable pupils to get to school safely, views we also put forward and covered in the paper.

ANGOLA — This year, nonprofits in Steuben County have faced new financial challenges in the face of COVID-19.
 In the midst of this challenging time, the Steuben County Community Foundation was able to award more than $320,000 in grants to 74 organizations through donor-established designated funds.
 Canceled and postponed fundraising events disrupted the anticipated cash flows for many organizations. Some individuals lost jobs, making it difficult to donate as generously.
 The past two years, the foundation has celebrated this annual distribution at the annual public meeting.
 “We decided that in the midst of COVID-19, our decision to cancel the public meeting shouldn’t overshadow these grant awards. We wanted to give our local nonprofits a reason to celebrate a little,” said Jennifer Danic, foundation president and CEO.
 Over the course of three days, staff from the foundation hand delivered checks to 18 local agencies, and reached out by phone or video chat to many of the remaining nonprofits to offer personal congratulations.
 Each designated fund at the foundation was established by a donor who was passionate about an organization and wanted to provide permanent support. Gifts to a designated fund are permanently invested.
 The foundation board and a committee of volunteers carefully oversee these investments, and the interest income is used to provide an annual distribution to a specific organization. These grants are awarded automatically, in contrast to the foundation’s application-based grantmaking cycles. In an uncertain year like 2020, designated funds are designed to offer a reliable funding source to help build a nonprofit’s financial sustainability.
 The majority of designated funds award grants for general support of the organization. This allows nonprofits some additional flexibility as grants are used to pay utility bills, to purchase program supplies or even to offset unexpected expenses in the midst of a pandemic.
 Designated funds account for the largest share of grant dollars awarded by the Foundation every year at just over 40%.
 The foundation is proud to help carry on donor legacies through facilitating this annual grant distribution to support their work in perpetuity. If you have questions about how to support a nonprofit through a designated fund, please contact the foundation office at 665-6656.
 The following list includes the grantees receiving designated grants from the foundation in 2020:

Cleveland City Council is expected to vote tonight on committing the city’s share of funds to help pay for $140 million in upgrades to Quicken Loans Arena.  Backers say the 22-year-old arena must be modernized to stay competitive and attract events that generate money for the entire community. But if the measure passes as expected, opponents may try to stop it on the ballot.
 The Cuyahoga County Progressive Caucus and the Greater Cleveland Congregations have been fighting against public funding for the upgrades. They say there should be a commitment to spending the same amount of money on important social needs in the city’s neighborhoods.
 The groups will be at tonight’s council meeting and announce their formal plan after the vote. They also plan a public meeting at 7 p.m. tomorrow at the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church to work on strategy.
 A referendum would take just over 6,000 valid signatures within 30 days after council’s approval to get the measure on the ballot. At issue is the city committing $88 million from admission taxes for the Q renovations. Cuyahoga County has already agreed to sell bonds to help finance the project. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Destination Cleveland will kick in the rest of the funding.

This is not unique to the UK; there are numerous cases of radical-right ideology breeding violence and terror across western countries.
 This is part of what researchers know to be a push to recruit teenagers to global terrorist organisations that promote ‘lone wolf’ terrorist attacks. Newly-proscribed Feuerkrieg Division (FKD), for example, opened its membership to those as young as 16, while evidence presented at a recent criminal trial found recruitment targeting some as young as 15 by those in National Action. A recent report by the BBC likewise showed radical group The Base speaking to disaffected teenagers across the world and attempting to recruit them. Groups promoting ‘lone wolf’ attacks have made youth a target audience not simply because they appear more susceptible to radicalisation—minors are capable of committing and have committed mass-casualty attacks around the world. One need only look to school shootings in the United States to see evidence of this.

To the editor:
 I have been a member of this community my entire life, my husband’s family owned a prominent business in Auburn for over 60 years. My husband and I were graduates of Auburn High School, our children and grandchildren will have all graduated from DeKalb Central Schools at the end of this school year. I love my community and want what is best for everyone.
 When my children were in school, they had a school board and administration that worked for the teachers, kids and community. They were engaged and listened to their community. We worked as a team with the school district to provide the best for all students. Over the past 10 years we have seen a change in this process, which upsets me.
 I have been doing my research on all the candidates running for school board and I am continually hearing from the sitting board president about her leadership skills and what she has done for our school district. However, what I have seen from Heather Krebs is someone who led a failed $37M referendum that lacked transparency which is the first time this community has ever defeated a referendum the school system requested! This leader helped foster and tried to promote a plan that used our children, teachers and support staff as bargaining chips as our kids could freeze in the winter if we did not fix our boilers! President Krebs also could not show any data on how we could support the items in the referendum operationally for years to come. There was also very little promotion of this plan other than the mandatory hearings and a few other gatherings to simply check the box and not explain how this was going to help our kids and community.
 As the vote for the referendum got closer, there was an onslaught of “Say Yesers” that argued the kids deserved everything in the referendum and you were against the kids if you voted No. As a matter of fact, a former DeKalb teacher called my generation who were against it the “Grumpy Elderly Minority” in an open meeting conducted by the school district. This teacher had close ties with the administration and members of the school board. From what I can see, this kind of attitude is being driven by a few people who believe they can do what they want with my taxpayer dollars.
 Both of the new candidates running for Jay Baumgartner’s seat, I believe are good men. However, there is one candidate I feel stands out over the other for a couple of reasons. First, I do not feel that any candidate should be on the school board that has a spouse working in the system. We need to remember that the school board holds the authority over the administration. Can they really be objective in making tough decisions that could impact their livelihood? Second, it seems the administration and the school attorney have more control than the school board. One candidate has a close connection with these people. How do I know? He is being promoted by some members of the DeKalb Central Foundation Board, administrators and their families and to top it off the school attorney. Is this kind of influence healthy for our community?
 Now more than ever, this community needs to take back our school and focus on the future of our children and the community. We need people who will work as a team, be transparent and hold the administration accountable. After all, the administration reports to the school board.
 I did my research and I will be voting for Josh Davis, Jeff Johnson and Valerie Armstrong (running unopposed).

This is likely just the tip of a massive iceberg. It is impossible to know just how many teenagers are part of the radical-right movement online, but observers estimate that the world-wide figures are significant. This makes sense. Raised in the aged of computers, teenagers are generally technologically savvy. The increased concern among radical-right groups of government infiltration and the push to ‘lone wolf’ style attacks has precipitated the migration of in-person communities to online ones. This allows minors to participate in these discussions more easily, but also to pose as adults and set up their own groups or radical social media channels promoting hatred. The online nature of things makes it more challenging for family, friends, and community watchdogs to catch and disrupt.
 Finally, it remains impossible to say the extent to which the teenagers of today will pose a threat to society when they become men. Planning a terrorist attack is the work of months or years. Radicalisation itself is a slow process. Eroding away pre-existing senses of morality to allow a person to embrace a new world-view (one filled with a desire to harm others), requires considerable time and effort. With radical-right groups promising members a sense of community and purpose, as well as comforting them and telling them that they are not to blame if they are social outcasts, these spaces appear like havens to disgruntled white teenagers and there, teens may be slowly indoctrinated. Terrorist manifestos, for instance, evidence how it was sometimes years between when a terrorist started making connections with other radicalised individuals and the fruition of his attack.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - South Carolina is seeing fewer traffic fatalities than in years past with the coronavirus pandemic keeping many off the roads and at home this year. However, the South Carolina Department of Transportation reports that South Carolina still has a long way to go, saying the state currently ranks highest in the nation for traffic fatalities.The South Carolina Department of Public Safety reports that there have been 678 fatal crashes this year. That’s 37 fewer than last year at this time. However, Duncan Smith, a SCDOT State Traffic Safety Engineer, said the Palmetto State has ranked in the top five states for traffic fatalities for the last 16 years and ranked highest in the latest report.SCDOT has been focusing on making rural roads safer because officials said that’s where 60% of all fatal accidents happen.“Given the fact that we have the number one fatality rate in the nation, we needed to think outside of the box and try to get in front of it,” Smith said. “To be proactive instead of reactive, we try to hit the areas that we think have the potential to be dangerous.”Officials said rural roads across South Carolina can be the most deadly when cars run off the road hitting trees or ditches.“At some of these rural roads where people lose their lives, oftentimes it’s because the operator feels comfortable, there’s less traffic on that roadway, and speeds could be higher,” South Carolina Highway Patrol spokesperson Trooper David Jones said.Smith said they have been continuing to focus on making rural roads safer in 2020 through the Rural Roads Safety Program. The program was launched in 2018, seeking to make 1,900 miles of rural roads safer. The department has launched 10 new projects this year.The Department of Transportation has already completed over 200 miles of the program, and officials said they hope to get all 1,900 miles completed by 2027.“This program is designed to prevent vehicles from running off the road, or if they run off the road provide them with a safe area to recover,” Smith said.Jones said that South Carolina has seen a dip in the number of fatalities on the roads this year with a significant dip during the beginning of the pandemic, but that trend started to change in the summer months.“We saw some of the businesses reopen, we saw more traffic, visitors coming to South Carolina, and we saw more people losing their life who had access to seat belts but made the poor decision not to buckle up,” Jones said.Jones stressed that despite this drop, as more people are traveling on the roads now, it’s important for people to continue to be vigilant in driving without distractions and buckling up.“There’s not a day that goes by that the toughest part of our job is to knock on a door and give a family the worst news of their life,” Jones said. “So as I sit around this Thanksgiving and get to hold onto my family, I think of those who don’t get that opportunity and the reality is it happens a couple times a day in South Carolina.”Copyright 2020 WIS.

Reminders of Laura's danger are everywhere in the region. In nearby Bell City, some debris piles are more than 6 feet (2 metres) high and 75 feet (23 metres) long. Concerns mounted Friday that Delta’s arrival would cause the debris to become airborne, deadly projectiles.
 Though homes and farmhouses in the area still stood, many rooftops with lingering damage from Laura were covered in blue tarps. In Cameron Parish, power poles along Highway 27 in a desolate stretch of marsh were all either broken or leaning — none appeared to have been repaired since the August storm. A few miles down the road, Creole presented a scene of utter devastation under an overcast sky that soon gave way to pouring rain. Where there used to be buildings, exposed slabs remained. A church and a convenience store had been reduced to debris, and fences were blown over or completely torn down.
 Delta had already clipped Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 2 hurricane just south of the resort city of Cancún early Wednesday, bringing high winds and heavy rain. No deaths or injuries were reported there.
 New Orleans, well east of the projected landfall area, was expected to escape Delta's worst impacts. But tropical storm force winds were still likely in the city on Friday, and local officials said they were preparing for the possibility of tornadoes.
 And in Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency like his counterpart Edwards did in Louisiana. Forecasters said southern Mississippi could see heavy rain and flash flooding.
 In Abbeville, Tony Russo was loading up on groceries late Thursday. “I don’t know really any different,” he replied when asked his reaction to the busy storm season. “You’re here. If you love it you stay,“ he said. But he added with a chuckle: “2020 has been a hell of a year.”

To the editor:
 I first met Heather Krebs while working on my third or fourth building addition project at DeKalb Memorial Hospital. It didn’t take me long to realize that she was attentive, contemplative and waited for all of the necessary information before offering her advice or professional opinion. I remember that when Heather spoke she did not leave any doubt in anyone’s minds about what she was thinking and why she was thinking it, but she always did it in a way that came from knowledge or experience and seemed to be able to validate everyone’s opinions in order to build consensus.
 Heather Krebs comes to the table open to others’ thoughts, ideas and suggestions and has no problem taking the time to make sure stakeholders are provided the opportunity to listen and learn. If you ask her a question she will give you an honest answer. If you need to know more, she will find out for you. She believes that anyone who is interested should always be able to get answers and in this day and age she understands the importance of transparency — not only being open and honest, but expecting it in return as well.
 Being born and raised in DeKalb County, Heather is very proud of her local heritage. Her actions and words seem to align with her passion and commitment to our schools and community. I am also a great supporter of our community and our school district and I would be proud to serve with Heather on any of the boards or committees that I serve on.
 I believe that Heather Krebs has proven ability and will continue to keep what is best for our stakeholders at the forefront of her decisions and leadership. I urge you all to consider the important and necessary qualities that Heather not only maintains presently but will continue to exemplify as a re-elected member of our school district’s Board of Education. A vote for Heather is a vote for knowledge, experience, openness and commitment to our students, families and community. Thank you for your time and consideration.
 A proud citizen of Auburn and respectfully yours,
 Al J. Wleklinski

 Economics affairs minister Taavi Aas (Center) says there are no plans to privatize state-owned airline Nordica.
 "I can't say we have a plan today [for privatization]. Our first plan today is for Nordica to survive as an airline," Aas said, responding to media reports that privatization would be a necessary alternative to a European Commission requirement to pay back state aid granted as relief from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We certainly don't have any plan to sell Nordica today, because in today's situation there is no opportunity to do so. First we need to get the company up and running and then make the ensuing decisions."
 Aas also said that Nordica was essential as a lifeline in and out of the country.
 "It is needed only for the reason that we have an ' emergency exit', so to speak," Aas noted.
 At the same time, Aas said he does not rule out privatization being on the agenda in future.
 "With airlines, as with any other type of transport company, aspects need to be considered very carefully - whether to privatize it, and if so, to what extent; to perhaps leave the state with some residual role in the process in the future, for instance," he added.
 As reported by ERR News, while the European Commission approved planned state aid to Nordica of €30 million, the domestic government has yet to implement this.
 On the other hand, the media has reported that the airline may face bankruptcy by year-end if it does not make use of the aid.
 While the state aid permit comes with other strings attached, including a European Commission requirement to apportion the money into an €8-million loan and the remaining €22-million as a boost in share capital, along with a freeze on top executive pay for this year and a requirement the funds not be used for aggressive market expansion, the economics affairs ministry claims that the commission will be proposing alternative solutions in due course.
 Most of Europe's state-owned airlines have applied for and/or been granted state aid in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic which saw most flights grounded during its peak, with many figures dwarfing the sum Nordica wants – for instance €6 billion to German airline Lufthansa, and €286 million for Nordica's Latvian competitor airBaltic.
 Riigikogu economics affairs committee Sven Sester (Isamaa) said that if the state is really interested in maintaining a direct flight link in and out of Estonia, it should be ready to provide support accordingly, as well as the airline operating as such.
 "If Nordica is only an outsourcer, if it only outsources abroad, then in the long run I don't see the need for the state to be involved, even if the company makes a profit," Sester, a former finance minister, said.
 Sester was referring to Nordica's business model, which involves leasing smaller aircraft, such as ATR 72-600 turboprop planes and Bombardier CRJ900s, rather than owning its own.
 In addition, a significant proportion of Nordica's business and in fact the main profit earner in pre-coronavirus times is its subsidiaries Regional Jet and Xfly, which operate flights for other airlines using the latter's liveried planes.
 Aas said that he hoped a cabinet-level decision would be coming next week.
