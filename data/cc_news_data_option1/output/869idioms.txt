“We spend a lot of time talking to organizations of all types who do advocacy,” said Andrew Stanley, Vice President of Product at Phone2Action. “We heard again and again that these organizations want intuitive tools that just work to help voters participate. The tools need to meet people where they are - on their smartphones - and be simple and fun to use. Off the shelf tools don’t work - they need to be easy to brand so they resonate with users and don’t create privacy concerns.”

CAPE TOWN - Amid a technical recession, some public service unions were threatening to down tools and bring the sector to a standstill if government went ahead with plans to cut its wage bill.


  Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tabled a budget that aimed to cut the state wage bill by R160 billion over the next three years.


  The SA Police and Allied Workers Union was threatening to down tools.


  Cosatu’s Western Cape secretary Malvern de Bruyn said that government could find other ways to save money.


  He said that public servants should be the last option.


  "There are many other ways that they can use to cut the wage bill - the amount of bodyguards they have to protect themselves, they must cut that..."


  Finance Minister Tito Mboweni was planning to reduce the public sector wage bill to cut back on government spending.


  But the union said that the move would paralyse workers and their income.


  The demands from unions came as slow economic growth has seen the country slip into a technical recession.

“I love Grove City. It’s kind of neat to see Christmas in Grove City,” Linda Brady said.


  The Grove City resident brought her granddaughter Brooke Eakin, 11, to South Broad Street, which was being turned into a film set complete with holiday decorations, lights and a Christmas tree lot.


  “Happiest Season” is a TriStar Productions romantic comedy set at Christmastime. The film is being shot in western Pennsylvania and stars Kristen Stewart, known for the “Twilight” film series. According to IMDB, the film is about a young woman with a plan to propose to her girlfriend while at her family’s annual holiday party, only to discover her partner hasn’t yet come out to her conservative parents.


  Thursday’s scene included Nonni’s Corner Trattoria and the Guthrie Theatre, which changed its marquee and movie posters to feature “It’s a Wonderful Life.”


  Part of South Broad Street was closed while crews put the finishing touches on Olde Town Grove City.


  Spectators were asked to move farther up the street once filming began.


  Brady and Brooke were among a small group of people who braved the cold – the wind chill was about 5 degrees by late Thursday afternoon – to get an up-close look at a movie set, which they agreed was very exciting for Grove City.


  “It’s something new for the area,” said Rachel Haney-Myers of Hermitage.


  She plans to see the movie, which will is scheduled to be released on Nov. 20. She is interested in becoming an actress, so she ventured to Grove City for the day to check out the activity surrounding “Happiest Season.”


  Sisters Jalisa Williams of Grove City and Jenna Williams, a student at Slippery Rock University, said that most people wouldn’t expect a big-budget film to end up somewhere like Grove City.


  “I think it will bring a lot of business to the town ...They definitely hit the jackpot here,” Jalisa Williams said.


  They are Stewart fans and hope to see the movie.


  The Guthrie would like to show the movie, and maybe even have a special event on opening night, said Spencer T. Folmar, president and founder of Veritas Arts, the nonprofit that runs the theater.


  Folmar, who is also a movie director and producer, reached out to the film crew when he learned that “Happiest Season” was filming in the Pittsburgh area.

CAPE TOWN - A parolee has appeared in the Tulbagh magistrates court in connection with the rape and murder of a 7-year-old boy in the Cape Winelands community.


  Reagan Gertse's body was found on Sunday hours after he was reported missing.


  Jakobus Petoors made a brief appearance on Tuesday morning on charges of abduction, rape and murder.


  Chaos erupted inside the courtroom today as relatives and angry community members tried to grab the accused while he was in the dock.


  He had to be removed and taken to the holding cells because the situation inside the court was too volatile.


  The matter against Petoors then continued in absentia and was postponed to 2 June for further investigation.


  The State was also still awaiting the results of DNA tests.


  The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed that the accused was out on parole but had not yet confirmed what he was convicted of.


  Petoors was released on parole in November.

It’s a nature the Penguins have largely been immune to for years. Yet they have looked decidedly vulnerable while getting outscored 24-8 against a schedule littered with teams basically playing out the season. A winless road swing through California last week culminated with a 5-0 loss to San Jose that led captain Sidney Crosby to place the blame squarely on his shoulders.


  Though Crosby — who has just one point since a 5-2 romp over Toronto on Feb. 18 pushed Pittsburgh into first place in the Metropolitan — hasn’t quite looked like himself of late, neither has the 19 other guys in the lineup on a given night. Asked if there was any one common thread for a swoon no one saw coming, Crosby shrugged.


  “It’s hard to point the finger at one specific thing, but I think putting the puck in the net a little more would give us some breathing room,” he said.


  Of course, for the puck to go into the net, the Penguins actually need to shoot it. It’s something one of the league’s most talented offensive teams has struggled to do lately. While on the surface Pittsburgh’s average of 33 shots per game during the losing streak looks healthy, the reality is that the Penguins have fallen into the habit of trying to make the pretty play instead of the right one.


  “Sometimes the ESPN highlight reel kind of gets in your mind,” forward Jared McCann said. “But I feel like sometimes, especially with the way things are going right now, we’ve just got to throw pucks on net. We’ve got to throw it at a goalie’s feet. We’ve got to make the easy shot, sometimes it’ll go in.”

Huawei, which remains in third place overall, also saw a small decrease in sales for the fourth quarter. For context, the U.S. placed Huawei on a trade blacklist last year, meaning the company can no longer use Google’s version of Android, which includes the full suite of Google apps. This restriction will have little impact in Huawei’s domestic Chinese market, where the company uses its own forked version of Android anyway, but it will likely deter international consumers from buying Huawei devices in the long run. We may see Huawei sales drop further as the impact of the trade ban affects future flagship phone sales.

Following his arrest, McInally was taken to Madrid, where extradition proceedings will begin.
 He has been wanted by Merseyside Police since January 2014, when officers intercepted a car in Crosby and recovered 6 kilograms of cocaine in a hidden compartment.
 Five members of the group allegedly led by McInally were later sentenced to a total of 48 years’ imprisonment.
 Andy Cooke-Welling, head of the NCA’s International Crime Bureau, said: “The arrest of Dominic McInally is the result of years of investigation by the NCA, Merseyside Police and our Spanish partners.
 “It is yet another success under Operation Captura, which has resulted in dozens of fugitives being brought to account, many of them after years on the run.
 “It should be clear to those attempting to flee from UK justice that they can never rest easy.”
 Members of the gang McInally has been linked to by police travelled to the border of France and Belgium to pick up drugs in 2014.
 They were secreted in a hidden compartment inside a Seat Leon car, but were intercepted by police officers in Sefton, Merseyside.
 As part of a high profile wanted campaign last summer McInally's mugshot was placed on billboards and even driven around Spanish tourist hotspots in the hope that someone would recognise him, the Liverpool Echo reports.

Location scouts had been looking for a small-town street with an old- fashioned movie theater, and Olde Town fit the bill.


  “We think it would look great in film,” he said.


  TriStar is owned by Sony Pictures, and the movie has some big names including Mackenzie Davis, Dan Levy, Mary Steenburgen, Victor Garber, Alison Brie and Aubrey Plaza.


  “It doesn’t get much bigger than this,” Folmar said.


  Ann Marie O’Rourke, Olde Town manager, agreed that it’s great exposure for Grove City.


  “Having all the work of Grow Grove City’s revitalization recognized is wonderful. To be selected as a location for a film ... what a wonderful opportunity for Grove City,” she said.


  The crew started filming at about 6:45 p.m. Thursday, and he was done at about midnight.


  Two New Castle men who have appeared in dozens of TV shows and movies also found their way into the day’s filming as diner patrons.


  Floyd Jackson and Jim Kuhn, Jackson said, “started out filming in the bitter cold weather that was brutal” and remained outdoors as filming continued for six hours. Jackson said he was part of a scene in which his character walked past Stewart on the street. Two additional hours of filming took place inside the Guthrie, he added.


  “Both of us were put in a scene that placed us very close to actress Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis,” Jackson said. “We were two of five actors put in that scene.”


  Jackson, who now has appeared in 11 major motion pictures since 2014, went on to note that Stewart “spoke to both of us at the end of filming and told Jim to tell his daughter (LeeAnn Kuhn) that she loved her” and that she posed for a photo with Jackson.


  Grove City Borough Manager Vance Oakes said that everything went smoothly, and there’s been a lot of interest.


  “We’ve been getting lots of calls,” he said, referring to people who were interested in becoming extras.


  Grove City police Chief Dean Osborne said that his department was assisting with traffic control, and that the department provided two patrolmen. The borough will be reimbursed for that expense.


  Rachael Roth, a spokesperson with Iron City Film Works, which served as a liaison between the borough and TriStar, refused requests for interviews or comment.

I saw another slow-feeding dog food bowl featured on one of those “top things on Amazon” lists. That one had a bad Fakespot rating. This has over 1,300 reviews, 4.4 stars and an A on Fakespot. This is a bowl with channels in it to slow down the rate your pet eats. It’s made of food grade material and is BPA, PVC, and Phthalate free so you don’t have to worry about your dog chewing it. It holds two cups of food. Owners of greedy dogs call it a “miracle” and say that while their dog was pissed off at first they did figure out how to use it. It’s said to stop dogs from burping and vomiting their food and to be easy to clean by just sticking it in the dishwasher. Some people say the little rubber stoppers on the bottom don’t work, but that they put it on a mat and that solved the issue.

"Somewhere along the line, floral design got divorced from the idea of home gardening,'' says Geall. "My focus is on the basics. And understanding the principles will help you adapt to what's around you." Foraged branches, twigs, invasive species, and even fruits and vegetables can be made into stunning arrangements, she says. Some of the arrangements featured in her book include tiny yellow tomatoes mixed with flowers. Grapes and berries are also fair game.
