While no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a businessÃ¢ÂÂ lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.

One of the most popular investment strategies is to focus on fast-charging growth companies. The appeal, of course, is that you can get in on the ground floor of a paradigm-shifting industry. But remember the adageÃÂ cash is king. The most dependable stocks to buy are usually what people call Ã¢ÂÂcash cows.Ã¢ÂÂ

Daniel Dyer started cosplaying in 2014 and dressed as “Captain America” at the Amazing Houston Comic Con. He bought the costume from Party City for $40.
 He attended the sixth annual Victoria Comic Fest and was “Captain America” again, but this time he wore a professional costume worth $300. He has gone to several comic conventions across, Texas which he says helps with his cosplaying.
 “Going to Cons and seeing people do (cosplay) got me more into it,” Dyer said. “It looked fun, and I have done it ever since.
 The Victoria Comic Fest was created by Megan Booth and her husband Bryan Hons in 2014, and they originally called it Victoria Comic Con. They took a break in 2019 to focus on rebranding and restructuring the event.
 They worked on making it more of a local community event rather than more expensive comic con.
 “It’s a small business with just me and my husband,” Booth said.
 The festival did not have any sponsors or funding from the city, so it relied on revenue from attendance and exhibitors’ booth rentals to pay for it. According to Booth, they expected about 2,000 people for the two-day event.
 The couple brought in several exhibitors, voice actors, had a Q&A session and even a cosplay contest for attendees. The couple brought in Ian Sinclair and Monica Rial, who both do voice acting for the popular anime series “My Hero Academia”.
 Exhibitors like Zachary Shaver sold artwork based on different franchises. Shaver previously went to Comic fest but this was his first year selling there with his cousin. He started drawing online and posting on Instagram. Shaver says he likes doing it to help his art.
 “”I just like improving my art and doing it for fun,” Shaver said.

Tod would finish his shift at 2 a.m., then walk two miles to his creek campsite where Tammy would be waiting.


  “I always thought camping was fun as a kid, but this is ridiculous,” Tammy told me.


  My next homeless story was four years later. I’d been tipped off that a veteran was sleeping next to traffic in Yountville.


  “The sun was out, the hot air balloons were up, but the lumpy bag under the tree on Washington Street didn’t move,” was my oh-so-colorful lede.


  After I woke him up, Ed said he had voluntarily left the Veterans Home after management insisted he go into a 90-day alcohol treatment program. He’d been camping for three and a half month on a lot where a hotel sits today. Restaurants let him use their restrooms, passersby gave him money and sandwiches.


  Still, winter was coming. Probably time to apply for readmission to the Veterans Home, Ed said.


  The next year, 1987, the homeless issue exploded in the Register. No more stories about a homeless person here, a homeless person there. Those afflicted by homelessness had become legion.


  That spring, KRON TV did a show about Napa’s largely unacknowledged homeless population. Fancy Napa has a dark underbelly, speakers said.


  Locals were humiliated, ashamed, angered. And before you knew it, a shelter opened in the gym at First Presbyterian Church, a 10-week experiment co-hosted by the Napa Red Cross.


  When the shelter closed and a permanent replacement did not happen quickly, activists backed the creation of a tent city on Riverside Drive near downtown.


  A tent city! Napans had not heard of such a thing. I visited and wrote about campers making an earnest effort to create community.
