Mississippi's Salvation Army and Red Cross help amid coronavirus

All those connectivity tools, not to mention global trade and tourism, exploded after 2004 and really wired the world. Which is why our planet today is not just interconnected, it’s  _interdependent_  — and in many ways even _fused._
 This has driven a lot of economic growth. But it’s also meant that when things go bad in one place, that trouble can be transmitted farther, faster, deeper and cheaper than ever. So, a virus-laden bat bites another mammal in China, that mammal is sold in a Wuhan wildlife market, it infects a Chinese diner with a new coronavirus and in a few weeks all my public schools are closed and I’m edging 6 feet away from everyone in Bethesda.
 But that’s why this virus crisis is so not over. Bill Joy, the computer scientist who co-founded Sun Microsystems, put it to me like this: “The last few weeks were actually pretty unsurprising and predictable in how the pandemic spread. But we’ve now reached a point where all of our interlocking systems, each with their own feedback loops, are all shutting down in unpredictable ways. This will inevitably lead to some random and chaotic consequences — like health care workers not having child care.”

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reported that with the “abrupt changes in activity levels” in northern Italy, it has tracked a reduction trend of NO2 for the last four to five weeks.
 So far, Italy has been the hardest-hit country in Europe by the new coronavirus.
 The government has implemented a wide lockdown, encouraging its 62 million people to stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary to go out.
 Similar drops in pollutants were detected in China after the Beijing government implemented widespread shutdowns to try and slow the spread of Covid-19.
