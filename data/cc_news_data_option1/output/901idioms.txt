The Future Health Index 2020 report highlights a clear demand among this generation of younger healthcare professionals for a work environment that fosters collaboration and offers flexibility. When choosing a hospital or practice in which to work, factors such as a culture of collaboration (64%) and professional autonomy (60%) are more important to younger healthcare professionals than a strong record of patient outcomes (48%) or the hospital/practice‚Äôs reputation (42%).

But, while they say this may have the ‚Äòadded benefit‚Äô of protection against coronovirus, they say the action is in response to a range of viruses in the region.
 ‚ÄúHand sanitizer is provided every year during flu season in our main buildings within Hertfordshire County Council,‚Äù said a spokesperson for the county council.
 ‚ÄúThis year we have moved from smaller gel pumps to larger foam pump dispensers on the walls that are more visible and make hand cleaning less messy.
 ‚ÄúWe have increased the number of dispensers in light of the range of viruses circulating in the east of England, including gastro-intestinal bugs.

Rogers added that CDC guidelines around coronavirus focus on good hygiene‚Äîa major focus of the hotel industry. Rogers said that hotels already have high cleaning standards in place and are taking further precautions in light of the outbreak. "In our industry, hotels have protocols in place to deal with everything from the common cold to the flu," Rogers said. "Hotels are cleaned each and every day. Currently, our members are working with industry experts to make adjustments to those protocols as needed, such as increasing the frequency of cleaning common spaces and supplying additional sanitizer stations with a minimum alcohol content of 60-90 percent."

Harvey Bischof, president of the OSSTF, put it this way: \"We were still in active discussions and this minister chose to roll a hand grenade out on the table. I would like to see him bring proposals to the bargaining table.\" At the same time, Bischof also acknowledged the concessions do move the needle closer to a settlement, assuming there is nothing in the small print that derails the concessions. There is precedent for that. When the government offered its first concession on class size from 28 to 25, it didn't mention that a part of that would involve lifting locally administered class size caps. That would have allowed classes to grow indefinitely, and it was effectively a poison pill for the unions.

This got me thinking about holidays. While I was at the show, I picked up a club brochure specifically about sites in Europe. It seems a while since we had a touring holiday in France and we really miss it. With the help of the club we have booked our summer break. We are taking our caravan over to Brittany and staying at four different sites. I am keen to visit Brittany again and even keener to try the local delicacies, crepes and seafood spring to mind. The booking process was brilliant, we chose our ferries and campsites and we let the club do all the booking. I am very excited now, roll on June!

After two hours witnessing the awfulness of Auschwitz, I we boarded the coach to travel to Birkenau, two miles down the road.
 Straight away, the sheer size of the camp was astonishing. Stretching further than the eye could see, the camp was isolated and as wind whipped around, felt as eerie as ever.
 The image of the train tracks and and main building at Birkenau is perhaps one most associated with the holocaust. While some took pictures of the infamous landmark, others seemed stunned - perhaps by the realisation that these tracks led millions to their death.

Bringing this to a larger device would have even more applications. Imagine taking a tablet and stretching it out into its own full-fledged monitor. CNET editor Scott Stein has a nice take on why foldables have more applications than just phones and tablets.
 For TCL, a scrollable phone would be a good way to get on the map. The company has long made budget phones using the Alcatel brand, and it has a deal to sell BlackBerry-branded phones. But the TCL name itself is associated with affordable TVs, not phones.
 And the company's budget roots should have us all encouraged. TCL is shooting to release a foldable or scrollable that's 30% to 40% less expensive than existing foldables in the market, according to Stefan Streit, general manager of global marketing for the company.
 That would make a huge difference when the starting price for the Galaxy Z Flip is a _mere_ $1,379.99.
 Here's the bad news. TCL has been steadily showing off these foldable concepts for a while, starting a year ago. And while they look cool, you shouldn't hold your breath for one to hit the market soon. Streit predicts one will come out in the first half of 2021.
 The company has 36 different sorts of prototypes it's worked on, according to Streit, so there's no guarantee the scrollable will be chosen.
 But if TCL wants to generate some buzz, it would be wise to put the scrollable on the road map. We're all itching for something different, and a scrollable phone might be something different that makes sense.

Here's some humbling math to put into perspective how little teachers are asking. This government wants to impose 1 per cent for all public sector workers. First off, unilaterally imposing contracts goes against collective bargaining in good faith. This is not negotiating. Secondly, we are asking for an additional 1 per cent. The average teaching salary is debatable and the reports range between $60,000 and $95,000. I can tell you that in my school board, the top grid teacher gets paid $98,000. This is after two post secondary degrees, 12 years of teaching experience, and a postgraduate additional qualification course or master's degree. Let's even assume the average is $98,000, then 1 per cent is $980 per year before taxes. Take off taxes it's about $650 per year. Divide that by 12 months and we are talking about $65 per month. That is like the cost of a tank of gas.

Regeneron aims to have a coronavirus treatment ready for testing in humans by August, the company's chief executive officer told CNBC. In the interview, he said the company already has a selection of antibodies and, during the coming weeks, will screen them to find the best candidates to address the coronavirus. Then, the plan is to produce 200,000 doses by late summer. Though in the long term a coronavirus treatment may not be as big for Regeneron's earnings as other drugs, any positive news from this program clearly will boost the shares. Unless the company reaches a stumbling block, while the coronavirus stays in the headlines, it's likely Regeneron shares are set for further gains.
