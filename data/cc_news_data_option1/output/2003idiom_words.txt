A spokeswoman for the agency told the Dutch news website NU.nl that the advice did not encourage “random sex contacts,” but that people who already knew each other or were in relationships but did not live in the same household could have sex without violating health guidelines.                                                                 Dutch officials said that if one partner was isolated because of suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection, sex at a distance was still possible, such as by telling erotic stories.                                                                                                                                                                                                   “It makes sense that as a single you also want to have physical contact,” the agency’s current guidance reads.                                                                 Earlier in the pandemic, the Dutch government, like others around the world, had advised people to have sex only with steady partners.

Residential rent collections have also declined, as tenants who lost jobs have stopped paying. But the erosion of commercial rents, so far, is worse and has stripped landlords of their largest source of income every month, especially for smaller property owners, and has started to jeopardize the health of their own businesses.                                                                 The cascading impact of the coronavirus pandemic and stay-at-home orders on New York City have reached a breaking point, property owners and developers say. Two months into the crisis, the steep drop in rental income now threatens their ability to pay bills, taxes and vendors — a looming catastrophe for the city, they warn.                                                                                                                                                                                                   If building owners cannot come up with enough money to pay their next property tax bill in five weeks, a deadline the city has refused to postpone, the city will be starved of an enormous revenue stream that helps pay for all aspects of everyday life, from the Fire Department to trash pickup to the public hospitals. It could lead to a bleak landscape of vacant storefronts and streets sapped of their energy.                                                                 While landlords have been unnerved by tenants’ rights groups and community nonprofits that have rallied around residential rent strikes, they said that companies with offices or retail spaces have been far more aggressive in skipping rent.                                                                                                                                  “They are missing the big part of the picture,” said Lok, referring to the dire conditions in New York City’s commercial real estate market.                                                                 The Community House Improvement Program, which represents around 4,000 landlords of rent-stabilized apartment buildings, said this week that among its members who also have commercial tenants, two-thirds of those tenants did not pay rent in April and May.
