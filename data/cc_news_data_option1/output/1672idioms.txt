Opening batsman David Warner believes Australia’s upcoming limited-overs tour of England will be scrapped because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Australians were scheduled to play three One-Day Internationals and as many T20Is against England in July, although changes to the English country cricket season now make that impossible.
 There was speculation the tour could be delayed until September but Warner was doubtful it would go ahead.
 “At the moment it’s highly unlikely we’re going to go over there given what’s happened in England,” Warner told _cricket.com.au_. He said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s infection with COVID-19 showed the gravity of the problem in the host nation.
 “He’s back up on his feet now and that’s fantastic news, but there’s a lot more to this than just sport being played,” said Warner. “The biggest picture is making sure we’re doing all the right things we can to flatten this curve and doing what we can do to play our bit in that. We’ve done a great job so far and all Australians should be credited.
 Warner rejected the idea of resuming sport without spectators. “No doubt at all, you want crowds no matter where you go and where you play. I love playing in England, it’s awesome,” he said.
 “You’ve always got someone, they always try and rev up. Fortunately for the team it’s pretty much just me, and that takes a lot of the heat off the other guys. We’re there to put bums on seats and hopefully we can entertain the crowd by playing a good brand of cricket.”
 Australia have already cancelled a two-Test tour of Bangladesh in June, and a limited-overs home series against Zimbabwe is also in doubt.
 Australia are due to host the T20 World Cup in October-November, for which the International Cricket Council has said it is “exploring all options”.
 Cricket Australia is particularly keen to go ahead with a Test series against India due to be played after the T20 tournament, warning this month it could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if it was scrapped.

Rodman also said some interesting things in his 1996 book _Bad As I Wanna Be_ and a subsequent interview with Oprah. Bear in mind, this is almost two decades before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, and also long before any active player in a major North American sports league had publicly come out. Rodman said he fantasized about being bisexual, though he denied ever acting on those desires. Still, a pretty groundbreaking revelation for the time.

They were assigned to follow tanks as they moved across Europe. When they crossed the Rhine they noticed a network of tunnels. When they encountered the enemy and engage in a firefight, Germans came out of the tunnels behind them and they were under fire from two sides. They were trapped in the open. Officers called for a smoke screen and the men were order to run two at a time toward nearby woods. Hiatt ran as fast as he ever had and made the dubious safety of the trees.

Rodman couldn't really score — he averaged 7.3 points per game for his career and cracked double digits for a season only once. So he made his bones by excelling at two things most players don't like to do: rebounding and defence. This is basketball's dirty work. You need some talent to be effective, but it's more about energy, desire and toughness — three things Rodman had in spades.

It wasn't all fun and games with Rodman. There was that time he kicked a courtside camera guy in an area where you should not kick people. That landed him an 11-game suspension, and he also served six games for headbutting a ref.

Anyway, when Pippen came back, Rodman was spent — and feeling down about not being Jordan's right-hand man anymore. So he went to coach Phil Jackson with a bold request: give me a full week off to go blow off some steam in Vegas. Jackson granted him 48 hours. Rodman (master of the Overton Window, apparently) probably crammed a week's worth of partying into that time, which he stretched past the agreed-on 48 hours. But he showed up on time for the first practice after he got back. And he dusted his teammates in a running drill designed to punish him. The point of the story? At the end of the day (or a two-day bender), Jordan and the Bulls knew they could count on him.
