_Too Old to Die Young_ is a difficult series to recommend—it’s painfully slow and extremely violent, and Miles Teller spits more than he speaks. But the show holds the distinction of being a singular viewing experience, more akin to a bloody art installation than anything resembling television. Creator Nicolas Winding Refn likes to (somewhat playfully) flex that his movies are masterpieces—please don’t encourage him, but _Too Old to Die Young_ is a small-screen masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Assuming anyone else actually watches it. — _Surrey_

There’s a sense of dread that hangs over Ben Affleck’s best film as a director, and it’s not because of the audacity of the big heist, in which a band of thieves tries to knock off Fenway Park. It’s because these characters are trapped by their circumstances. They’re an insular pack that shuns outsiders; Affleck’s Doug MacRay wants nothing more than to escape his Charlestown enclave, but leaving can seem more daunting than robbing an armoured truck in broad daylight. Packed with exhilarating action sequences and the most believable Massachusetts accents you’ve heard on screen, _The Town_ is a perfect Boston movie, and a heist movie that’s worth rewatching over and over. — _Sayles_

Swords, battles, kings and queens, zombies. All familiar territory in the era of Peak TV, and on paper, the Korean series _Kingdom_ could be boiled down to _Game of Thrones_ meets _The Walking Dead_. However, _Kingdom_ stands on its own, featuring some truly impressive set pieces and solid performances all around, as well as a subplot featuring political scheming that recalls early _Thrones_. Plus, as a treat, there are _a lot_ of zombies, and a lot of truly fun, scary, B-movie moments. — _Bergmann_

Fans of dating shows like _The Bachelor_ know there’s an inherent stupidity to it. _Burning Love_ takes that stupidity and amps it up to the max. Some of the contestants in _Burning Love_ ’s first season include Annie, the schoolteacher with a heart of gold; Haley, the party animal who literally never wears pants; and Tamara, who has a monkey heart. Featuring a who’s who of indie comedy darlings, Erica Oyama’s short-lived parody series is a supremely silly sendup of the ABC series, and worth a watch if you were let down by Peter’s season or if you are in the mood for some _Wet Hot American Summer_ –style silliness. — _Bergmann_

In need of a soothing distraction from the woes of the world? Watch _Twin Peaks_. Want a harrowing reflection of human nature’s dark, rotting heart? Watch _Twin Peaks_. Duality is core to David Lynch’s creepy, quirky, utterly unique gift to network television, which characteristically came about 25 years before its time. (Fortunately, Lynch got the chance to give an encore down the road; more on that later.) _Twin Peaks_ iconography is so widespread it’s almost grown divorced from the show itself: Coffee! Cherry pie! Diane! “Wrapped in plastic”! But Lynch’s surreal creations, soundtracked by Angelo Badalamenti’s yearning synths, remain timeless. The director famously dreamed up the red-curtained Black Lodge while resting on the hood of a hot car. It hasn’t left our collective subconscious since. — _Herman_

Tim Robinson’s cherry-bomb-blast sketch show is the perfect comedy series for this unmanageable moment—extreme, sometimes unsettling, and so utterly devoted to ridiculousness that it allows/forces you to discard the day-to-day and embrace every last preposterous premise. Robinson and his coconspirators apply Method-level commitment to baby beauty pageants, parodies of Johnny Cash lore and local lawyer commercials, airplane vengeance, and more, perpetually pushing the bit toward total absurdity. I’m not sure _I Think You Should Leave_ is driving at any grand unifying truth. If it is, though, it’s definitely doing it in a car with a great steering wheel. — _Devine_

The only bad thing about watching the three (and counting) films in the _John Wick_ franchise is accepting that an adorable puppy has to be killed by Theon Greyjoy. But one harrowing moment sets up what might genuinely be the most consistently great action franchise ever made—a delirious combination of well- choreographed fight sequences, bizarre world-building that implies everyone on Earth is an assassin in hiding, and an arcane currency system holding it all together. Yes, a puppy had to die. But Keanu Reeves’s Baba Yaga gets revenge against the people responsible and the system writ large one glorious, improbable headshot at a time. The _John Wick_ movies are art of the highest order. — _Surrey_

Much has been made of throughline between _First Reformed_ ’s Rev. Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) and Travis Bickle from _Taxi Driver_ , for which _First Reformed_ director Paul Schrader wrote the script. Both men are left disaffected by the state of their worlds, and both are willing to go to violent lengths to express that. But where Bickle mostly directs his rage at the small-town pimps and scum that populate his New York City, the small-town pastor Toller wants to take aim at the corporations that are killing the planet and the religious organizations they are in bed with. _First Reformed_ is a deeply moving film about the descent of man whose faith has forsaken him. Can anything—or anyone—save him before it’s too late? — _Sayles_

Mr Sunak added: “That support will be delivered through two main schemes.
 “To support liquidity amongst larger firms I have today agreed a new lending facility with the Governor of the Bank of England to provide low cost, easily accessible commercial paper.
 “To support lending to small and medium sized businesses, I am extending the new business interruption loan scheme I announced at Budget last week so that rather than loans of £1.2 million it will now provide loans of up to £5 million with no interest due for the first six months.
 “Both of these schemes will be up and running by the start of next week.”
 Mr Sunak added that he is also taking “a new legal power” to “offer whatever further financial support I decide is necessary”.
 Mr Sunak he was providing cash grants of up to £25,000 to smaller businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors with a rateable value less than £51,000.

She says originally she planned a schedule with 30-minute chunks, but it’s now less rigid and more focused on ticking off tasks each day. “We had to loosen up in terms of accepting they are going to watch telly,” she says.
 Ms Rickman, from south London, agrees that a schedule is important - especially for children who are already at nursery or school and will be used to routine.
 “Children really thrive on predictability, especially when life is changing around them,” she says.
 But the 31-year-old, who already home-schools her children, stresses that any schedule should be more like a “flow” - rather than something strict.
 She suggests creating weekly or daily activities and then read the plan out or “stick it on the wall”.
 “Maybe Wednesdays have a family film afternoon. Or give teenagers some private time to Skype their friends,” she suggests.
 Educational psychologist Zubeida Dasgupta also stressed the importance of structure, from her home in Brighton and Hove where she and her family are also currently self-isolating.
 “We know when people are faced with uncertainty or worry, having some certainties, for example through a bit of structure, could really help,” she says.
 “Although on the face of it, some children may feel excited by being off school, the reality is weeks - or months - on end playing Xbox and watching movies may not be as fun as we think.
 “It’s about getting a balance - having a structure and integrating some fun,” she says. “It might be helpful to think about how we distinguish weekdays and weekends.”
 In terms of schoolwork, some schools and teachers have already spoken about the possibility of setting work for pupils to access online.
 The current health crisis is certainly a “unique situation” for schooling, says Ms Rickman.
 “For parents who are suddenly plunged into it, I think it could be a challenge.”

I discovered this show because I thought any TV series from the Sundance Channel—home to _Top of the Lake_ , another quarantine must-watch— _had_ to be good, and I wasn’t disappointed. The miniseries takes place during the Cold War in East and West Berlin. Martin Rauch, a 24-year-old in the East, is conscripted against his will to be a spy in the West. Young, wet behind the ears, and naive enough to still be human inside (unlike some of his Soviet- backed bosses), Martin is torn between loyalty and his loved ones, all while trying to conceal a hidden identity he never wanted in the first place. Oh, and if he messes up the world could plunge into nuclear war. — _Johnson_

Desde su creación hasta la actualidad, la CTC tiene entre sus objetivo perfeccionar el funcionamiento del sindicato a todas las instancias establecidas, siempre bajo el principio de representatividad, pues la meta es que todos los trabajadores se identifiquen con la labor de su organización.      Con ese empeño, la CTC en el municipio de Amancio inauguró recientemente un aula elemental para la superación de dirigentes sindicales de base.      Según explican los responsables de la actividad, en cada encuentro se tratan temas medulares para el desarrollo de la agrupación y que constituyen las principales preocupaciones entre los trabajadores locales.      Al frente de los debates, amancieros que han dedicado gran parte de su vida a la labor sindical, con una vasta experiencia y resultados relevantes en tan importante tarea.      Amplia participación y debates profundos han caracterizado los primeros encuentros, siempre con la mira puesta en el futuro inmediato de una organizacion que camina con pasos seguros en el proceso de perfeccionamiento de la economía nacional y cobra protagonismo gracias al quehacer contante los afiliados a sus sindicatos      A mi juicio esta iniciativa constituye una excelente vía para dar cumplimiento a varios de los acuerdos emanados del Congreso obrero, satisfacer las expectativas de los trabajadores locales y retomar el protagonismo de la organización, esa que tanto aclaman los afiliados.      Sin embargo considero oportuno el llamado a la permanencia y la seriedad en este proyecto que da sus primeros pasos y se consolida con la entrega de sus protagonistas.      Enhorabuena y larga vida a nuestra aula elemental para la superación dirigentes sindicales en Amancio.

Experimental studies have identified a brain structure called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as vital for this ability. It surrounds the bundle of fibers that connect the left and right hemisphere of the brain. When you watch another person express fear, your ACC lights up. Studies in animals confirmed that the message about another’s fear travels from the ACC to the amygdala, where the defense responses are set off.
 It makes sense why an automatic, unconscious fear contagion would have evolved in social animals. It can help prevent the demise of an entire group bound by kinship, protecting all their shared genes so they can be passed on to future generations.
 Indeed, studies show that social transmission of fear is more robust between animals, including humans, that are related or belong to the same group as compared to between strangers.
 Nevertheless, fear contagion is an effective way of transmitting defense responses not only between members of the same group or species but also across species.

One of the most harrowing movies of the past decade, Ari Aster’s _Hereditary_ is at its core an exploration of grief. After an unspeakable tragedy, the Graham family is visited by a number of horrors, including a few of the paranormal variety. Mother Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is hit particularly hard as she looks for whatever coping mechanism she can find. Eventually, she discovers that everything isn’t quite what it seems—and that the pain she’s experiencing may have been unavoidable all along. _Hereditary_ can scare you, and it can gross you out, but it leaves its most vicious marks psychologically. — _Sayles_
