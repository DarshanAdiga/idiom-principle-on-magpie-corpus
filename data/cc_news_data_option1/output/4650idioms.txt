 # GOP captures second Democratic US House seat in California
 Michael R. Blood
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Los Angeles_ – Republican Young Kim defeated U.S. Rep. Gil Cisneros on Friday in a Southern California district, the second GOP candidate to snatch a Democratic-held seat in the state this year.
 The contest in the 39th Congressional District anchored in Orange County was a rematch from 2018, when Cisneros was one of seven Democrats who claimed GOP- held California districts that year.
 Kim overcame President Donald Trump’s poor performance in heavily Democratic California, where he got only one-third of the votes.
 Kim, a former state lawmaker, was born in South Korea and grew up in Guam. She joins Washington state’s Marilyn Strickland and California’s Michelle Steel as the first Korean American women elected to Congress.
 Strickland, a Democrat, last week won the open 10th Congressional District southwest of Seattle. Steel, a Republican, claimed the 48th District in Orange County on Tuesday from Democratic Rep. Harley Rouda.
 Republicans set out this year to reclaim at least some of the seats lost two years ago.
 They have recaptured two, with wins by Steel and Kim, and are leading in two others: the Central Valley’s 21st District, where Republican former Rep. David Valadao was ahead of Democratic Rep. TJ Cox, and the 25th District north of Los Angeles, where Republican Rep. Mike Garcia was in a back-and-forth fight with Democrat Christy Smith.
 Republicans also held the open 50th District seat anchored in San Diego County, which former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa will represent after winning his comeback bid two years after deciding not to seek reelection in a neighboring district that has become more Democratic. The 50th District has a nearly 10-point GOP registration edge. The seat was vacated earlier this year by Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter after he pleaded guilty to a federal corruption charge.
 The wins by Kim and Steel mark a surprising turnaround in a state where Democrats hold every statewide office, have commanding majorities in the Legislature and congressional delegation, and a nearly 2-to-1 advantage over Republicans in registered voters.
 Kim, 58, overcame a Democratic registration edge in the district, which also includes slices of Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, and surmounted widespread distaste for Trump.
 In the campaign, Kim depicted Cisneros as subservient to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Cisneros, a Navy veteran and $266 million lottery jackpot winner who founded a charitable foundation with his wife, promoted his efforts to protect health care.

 # Walz considering new virus restrictions amid deadliest week
 ASSOCIATED PRESS
 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz indicated Friday that he’s planning to announce additional restrictions next week aimed at indoor activities involving young adults ages 18 to 35 in hopes of slowing the rapid spread of the coronavirus.
 The Democratic governor would not give specifics about those plans, but he reiterated that he’s not contemplating another lockdown such as the one he imposed last spring. Elected officials across the country are showing little appetite for imposing the kind of lockdowns and large-scale business closings seen last spring.
 Walz said officials have gotten “better at understanding who’s getting this, where they’re getting it and when they’re getting it.” Another factor, he added, is "tolerance — of what people will and will not do.”
 The governor spoke at the Minnesota Department of Health’s regular briefing. where Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm noted that this has been Minnesota’s deadliest week of the pandemic. The department on Friday reported 46 new deaths, the state’s second-worst daily death toll yet. That raised the total reported since Saturday to 248 and the state’s cumulative death toll to 2,839. The state also reported 5,552 new cases Friday for a total of 207,339.
 Walz on Tuesday announced tighter nighttime restrictions on bars and restaurants aimed at young adults, and lower crowd limits for weddings, funerals and other gatherings including holiday dinners. A 10 p.m. cutoff for serving food and alcohol at bars and restaurants was due to take effect Friday night. Officials are particularly worried about the spread accelerating as families gather for Thanksgiving, but cautioned that it will be weeks before the new restrictions put any dent in the growing numbers.
 Walz was joined by Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who was named Monday to President-elect Joe Biden’s Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board. If people want to be serious about loving and protecting their families, Osterholm said, they should find new ways to celebrate Thanksgiving.
 “This is our COVID year," he said. "This is not going to be like last year, whether it be the holidays, whether it be everyday life, and it hopefully will not be what it's going to be like next year.”
 Walz said he and Osterholm had good discussions early on about how long people could be kept in a stay-at-home situation. While another lockdown would make sense from a “purely epidemiological perspective,” Walz said, “from a social psychology perspective, and how divided we are, and how controversial this is for some people, it makes it very difficult.”
 Osterholm, who emphasized he was speaking for himself and not Biden’s task force, endorsed the governor’s comments.
 “There is reality, and there is the ideal. In the ideal world right now, we would all try to limit all the contact we have for the immediate weeks and try to break the back of this," Osterholm said. "That’s not realistic."

Nov 14 (Reuters) - Scotland captain Stuart Hogg has said the team will head into Saturday's Autumn Nations Cup clash against Italy in Florence hoping to inspire the nation like their soccer counterparts.
 Scotland's soccer team qualified for the European Championship finals for the first time since 1996 on Thursday after a penalty shootout victory over Serbia in a playoff.
 Manager Steve Clarke said after the game he was overjoyed to give the Scottish people something to cheer about amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "It has been a tough year for everybody," Hogg told reporters. "So if we can play a small part by putting smiles on people's faces by getting results for everybody then that's us doing our jobs."
 "The big thing which hit home was that we're there to inspire the nation and the football boys did exactly that.
 "Now it's our turn... How good would it be if we were to win on Saturday? It would cap a great week for Scottish sport and that's our aim."

“It’s something that's necessary because the country is so diverse,” said Free, a hospitalist at RMC. “Just as a woman in this country, we’ve had a hard way to go to at least fare (similarly) in a man’s world, and being a Black woman and having that fight, it’s an accomplishment.”
 When you listen to Free unwrap her background — her Indiana upbringing in the 1960s; her parents’ insistence on education and colorblind fairness — you get a sense that this was preordained, or at least predictable.
 Free’s father, an African-American, was a non-commissioned officer in the Army, so the family moved often. Her mother, who was biracial and fair- skinned, identified as a Black woman. “I never looked at her as a white woman,” Free said. And she taught her children to treat people graciously, whoever they were.
 “My mother said that if you ever meet someone of a different culture or language, if you don’t understand them, it’s your problem,” Free said. “You have to pay attention, take your time and listen and learn.”
 Compassion embedded into her life. She hated seeing suffering. “I loved taking care of sick things, whether it be animals or bugs or people,” Free said. In school she embraced science and math and majored in biology and chemistry before entering Morehouse. Medicine became her future, an unavoidable career path.
 Plus, “I would have died if I had gone into business. I would have been eaten alive. I have an identical twin sister who’s an executive in business, and she’s a barracuda, so I know the difference. My personality fits in medicine.”
 I asked if she thought her new role with the RMC system was a big deal. She wasn’t sure.
 She paused, and thought again of her mother’s lessons, the ones from her 1960s childhood in Indiana.
 “My mother always told me that in order to do even average, you have to be better than average as a Black person,” Free said. “And to be the best you have to be the very best and you have to continue to strive. You cannot take the time to be lazy.”
 She had her answer.
 “I wouldn't think it’s a big deal, but it is a big deal, and I should appreciate it that way …” she said. “Here in Anniston it is a big deal, and I’m going to go ahead and say, ‘Yes, thank you, Jesus.’”

If pounding the rock is Plan A and McGarrey throwing is Plan B, then the mystery element of a halfback pass proved a back-breaker. Call it a Garnet special, with Shane Reynolds taking a pitch and finding backfield mate Bradley streaking down the sideline on a go-route, a 35-yard touchdown.
 “That was really awesome,” Gallagher said. “I looked over and saw Reynolds throwing it, and it was just a perfect throw. I was so excited for them because they worked on that play all week in practice, and to be able to come out and run it perfectly is really cool."
 Reynolds was the workhorse at 14 carries for 104 yards. Bradley toted 11 times for 93, with three scores, including a 26-yarder in the third. Cullen Mink added a 33-yard TD in the fourth. McGarrey finished 4-for-9 for 146 yards, albeit with two lost fumbles. Gallagher hauled in three passes for 96.
 Ridley (2-2) struggled mightily on offense, after Tahir Mills burst up the middle for 54 yards on its first play. Mills had 111 yards on seven touches; the rest of the offense accounted for 33 yards on the other 34 snaps.
 John Heller, two weeks removed from throwing three touchdowns against Upper Darby, went 0-for-10 with an interception by Sean Williams. Gavin Kingsborough's night (13 carriers, 19 yards) typified the tough sledding against the Garnet front.
 The Ridley defense didn’t surrender, with Jimmy Reynolds and Jack Wills forcing second-half fumbles, Reynolds recovering his and sophomore Antonio Saahir gathering the other. Punter Nick Falcucci booted seven times for a healthy average of 36 yards.
 But all that hardly made a dent against Garnet Valley, which outgained the Green 482-144 and had 21 first downs to Ridley's four. It's a team that is explosive, versatile and very confident heading into next week’s showdown with Haverford.
 “I think it gives our team a lot of confidence because we know that we believe in every single player on our offense,” Gallagher said. “Every single guy is doing their job on every single play and we’re just able to move the ball when we execute like we do in practice.”

Al contrario de algunos vaticinios de que la televisión tiene un futuro gris ante el auge de las plataformas streaming, para el experimentado productor Angel Puello eso no es cierto porque la población continuará disfrutando de su contenido.
 El creativo, que durante años fungió como productor del popular programa “Sábado de Corporán”, entre otros contenidos para la televisión y presidente de la productora Ångel Puello Televisión Group aseguró que pantalla chica mantiene su liderazgo aquí y en el extranjero.
 “Cuando se habla de esa televisión tradicional nos referimos a la televisión continua que vemos por aire y en los canales de cable. Sin embargo, expresamos que la gente siempre seguirá viendo la televisión tradicional ya que tiene un público cautivo, compuesto por personas que mayormente superan los 35 años, acostumbrada ver ese modelo televisión”, comentó Puello.
 Manifestó que en el país la fuerza del modelo tradicional de la televisión “es muy elevada y le quedan muchos años reinando, ya que no todo el mundo goza de conexión a Internet y de televisores inteligentes que les permitan observar la llamada televisión a la carta”.
 Angel Puello recordó que hace un tiempo dictó una charla en Infotep en la que abordó el futuro de la televisión y contó su experiencia de 30 años en la industria audiovisual.
 “Cuando nos encontramos ahora con la noticia de que un nuevo producto de Netflix llamado Direct es lanzado en Francia para probar un nuevo formato de televisión en línea, es decir, Netflix está probando un canal de programación continua, similar a los canales de transmisión estándar; o sea la televisión que acostumbramos a ver siempre por aire y cable. Se asegura que Netflix transmitirá su nuevo producto a través de su sitio web y estará disponible inicialmente sólo en Francia. No obstante, la información es un hecho ya que la compañía habilitó el soporte el pasado 5 de este mes en varias ciudades francesas”, comentó.
 Agregó que Netflix Direct será exclusivamente para usuarios suscriptores a los que les mostrará programas de televisión y películas de Francia, Estados Unidos y otras regiones. “Esta compañía apuesta por este producto nuevo para ellos, ya que se dio cuenta que hay una enorme cantidad de usuarios que quieren ver la programación sin el trabajo de elegir contenido. Confirmando así lo que vaticinamos en nuestra charla de años atrás”.
 Ante esa situación no dudó en afirmar que nuestra televisión tradicional seguirá reinando. “En República Dominicana tendremos muchas opciones locales de televisión a la carta, que se combinarán con la televisión continua para así diversificar la oferta televisiva para los que deseen verla por celular, tablet, computadoras, los aparatos televisivos tradicionales o los llamados inteligentes”, concluyó Puello.

Rey slides under the table but Rollins shoves it into his face. Rollins and Rey now on the top rope, Rey fights free and lays into Rollins as Rollins is still seated at the top. Rey outside now, climbs up with Rollins and tries a hurricanran but Rollins blocks it. Rollins now powerbombs Rey through the table from the second rope. Cover from Rollins but just a 2 count. Rollins gets the chair from between the ropes, removes the end caps from the legs and tries to blind Rey. Dominick pulls Rollins out, eats a super kick for that. Murphy heads over now, Rollins calms things down outside, but when he goes back in eats a drop kick assisted by the chair. Murphy into the ring now, helps Rollins up and gives him the chair again. Rey held up by Murphy, and Murphy with a knee strike to Rollins. Murphy stares at Rollins then leaves the ring. Rollins yells at Murphy, Rey botches a 619 but does it again, then hits a frog splash to Rollins and wins.

Minnesota put together another scoring threat in the fourth quarter but Iowa cornerback Riley Moss made a perfect read on a pass, intercepted and returned it 60 yards. Moss, who had a pick-six last week against Michigan State, now has four interceptions in three career games against Minnesota.
 \--Petras continues to be erratic at times and like many young quarterbacks, seems to struggle with his progressions when he can’t find his primary receiver. He completed his first five passes of the night before throwing the interception. That started a stretch in which he completed just one of nine passes although he later made a couple of decent throws, including a short touchdown pass to Ihmir Smith-Marsette. One of his most noticeable misplays of the night came on Iowa’s first offensive play of the second half. He made a great play-action fake and Smith-Marsette got open five yards behind the defense but Petras badly underthrew him, allowing the defender to break up the play. Petras finished 9 for 18 for 111 yards.

Is anyone else feeling a little antsy? With the onset of the inevitable winter snow upon us, I have been reminiscing of places I have traveled to or would like to travel to in the future. I think it is my brain’s way of coping with the usual hunkering down that happens in these cold months, along with the ever important need to stay home to help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community. So humor me for a bit as I remember the good times I have had outside of my cozy house.
 My fiance, Isaac, and I’s favorite place is not too far from home actually. We visited Tettegouche State Park for the first time this summer and were lucky enough to be able to sneak in one last visit this fall. Looking out to the cliffs as fog rolled in from Lake Superior was a stunning site to see. There are many other parks and beaches along the North Shore that we have loved, and many more that are still on our list to visit.
 I am grateful to have access to these beautiful places as being outdoors is often the safest option right now, especially when visiting with other people. Recently we took advantage of, possibly, the last nice weekend of the fall and visited friends in Split Rock Lighthouse State Park. Another beautiful park right in our backyards, it was so nice to fit in one last outdoor adventure before we have to start lacing up our snow boots to go outside.
 Another one of my favorite places is a little farther away. Actually, more like 24 hours away by plane. A few years ago I got the opportunity to travel with family to the countries of Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam. Each one of the places was so unique and beautiful in its own way. From the stunning Gardens by the Bay in Singapore to the Angkor Wat Temples in Cambodia to the quiet waters of Ha Long Bay in Vietnam, I have so many fond memories of this trip.
 Although it may be a long time before I get to travel outside of Minnesota, I do have quite a few places on my travel bucket list. For Isaac and I, we would both love to travel to Italy. We are both enamored by Italian cuisine and the Mediterranean waters. Additionally, we would both love to visit some of the European countries from which our families came from. For Isaac, that would be Germany. For me, the Scandinavian region—specifically Norway and Sweden—would be my picks. Once we get married and are able to plan a honeymoon, perhaps these will be some of our destinations.
 The other country we would love to explore more is closer to home. Actually, it’s the closest country to us in Minnesota—Canada! We visited Canada a few years ago on a brief trip, but there is so much more that we want to see. One place in particular would be Banff National Park. We have heard so many great things about the area, even from my Dad who used to visit the park when he was younger, that we know it is a must-see. Hopefully when the world is able to be opened again to safe international travel, we can cross the border to check it out.
 Have you been daydreaming of going to far away places like I have? If yes, I hope those thoughts help keep your spirits up during these tough times. It has been important for me to remember that the situation we are in is not permanent. It will not last forever. But if we do the right thing today, we can have a better chance at getting to visit all of our favorite places and new destinations in the future.

The Toronto Raptors will fill the vacancy on Nick Nurse's coaching staff with Chris Finch, ESPN reported Friday.
 Former assistant Nate Bjorkgren, who spent the past two seasons with the Raptors, was hired as the head coach of the Indiana Pacers in October, creating the opening.
 Finch leaves the New Orleans Pelicans, where he assisted coach Alvin Gentry before he was in the running for the Pacers' coaching slot. He also coached alongside Mike Malone with the Denver Nuggets in 2016-17 and spent five seasons (2011-16) with the Houston Rockets.
 Nurse and Finch have a history after coaching in the British Basketball League at the same time in the late 1990s. They both later moved on to the D-League, where Finch led the Rio Grande Valley Vipers to the 2010 championship. Nurse replaced Finch as the Vipers' head coach in 2011 when Finch left for the NBA's Rockets.
 Nurse was Finch's assistant for the Great Britain men's basketball team at the FIBA EuroBasket 2009, FIBA EuroBasket 2011 and the 2012 Olympics.

Maybe the District 3 champs will find a little more competition next week, when they host a PIAA Class 3A semifinal at the A-Field. No one's given them a game yet.
 Wyomissing will play either District 4 champ Danville (7-1) or District 12 champ Archbishop Carroll (2-2) next week. Those teams play Saturday at Danville.
 Friday's win was Wyomissing's first in the PIAA Tournament since beating Montoursville 45-28 in a 2014 quarterfinal. It lost to Dunmore the following week 23-21.
 The Spartans greased the skids Friday with an opportunistic defense, which had the Chiefs on the run from the outset. They dominated play in the box, stuffing the running game and forcing quarterback Dominick Spartaro to escape the pocket. He completed some short passes into the flats, but never had time to look down field. He was sacked twice in the first half and flushed from the pocket half-a-dozen other times.
 "Our defense is special," said Wolfrum after watching them hold the Chiefs to 111 total yards in recording their fifth shutout of the season.
 They held Gio Spataro, the Chiefs' all-time rushing leader with over 4,000 yards, to just 25 yards on eight carries.
 "I think we put together a great team performance on defense," said Zechman. "They have a great player (Maryland tight end recruit CJ Dippre), and we we keyed a lot of stuff off him. We knew what passes were coming when he was in certain positions and our coaches put us in position to put us in the right places to get those coverage sacks."
 The Spartans put it away quickly in the second half. Fullback Evan Niedrowski broke loose for a 27-yard run on the opening play of the third quarter and Zechman ended the eight-play drive with a 4-yard TD run.
 Despite the romp, Wolfrum sees room for improvement. He said he thinks the Spartans' best game is yet to come.
 "We’re scoring 47 points but we’re still making plenty of mistakes," he said. "We can still get a lot better."

 The defending Class 6 champion Spartans couldn’t find their offense through a mistake-filled first half and were facing a visiting Francis Howell team gaining confidence with every passing minute in the Class 6 District 2 football championship game on Friday night.
 True to form, De Smet found its game in the second half, and behind a monster game from running back Rico Barfield, pulled away for a 28-7 win. The Spartans (5-0) will host Fox (10-1) in the state semifinal next week.
 “We just had to stay focused,” Barfield said. “At halftime, we talked to each other, we planned out what we wanted to do, and we just came out and executed it in the second half.”

But as they waited, the rest of the conference’s Week 2 slate slipped into a state of chaos. At Utah, 28 players were being held out because of positive tests or contact tracing protocols, prompting the cancellation of its game against UCLA. A week that began with debates over strict contact tracing protocols in Berkeley ended with Cal losing its first game to an outbreak at Arizona State — until a makeup game was rescheduled on the fly with UCLA for Sunday morning.
 The outbreak in Tempe arrived just days after the Sun Devils left Los Angeles. By Friday, Arizona State coach Herm Edwards and several of his players had tested positive and were in quarantine.
 USC emerged from that matchup last Saturday without any positive cases, and a spokesman told The Times that additional safety protocols were necessary.

He's the man now, and will prove it at Survivor Series. Roman says he likes McIntyre and respects him, but he's back now and ever since he came back no one knows who McIntyre is. He doesn't watch RAW, no one does because they're all watching Smackdown to watch Roman. I mean, he's not entirely wrong. Roman asks McIntyre to tell everyone who he is now that Roman is back. McIntyre repeats the question, but says he's the one who'll beat Orton on Monday and then show Roman who the secondary champion really is. Jey Uso with a run in, he takes a mic and starts jawing at McIntyre. Jey says it's not Monday, astute observation. He says McIntyre is being real disrespectful right now, and tonight he'll get McIntyre just like he did the last guys who were disrespectful. Jey asks for a match tonight, McIntyre shoves him down and out of the ring before staring at Roman again. The Samoan Dynasty head out, leaving a fuming McIntyre in the ring.

Unfazed by the decision of the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo- Olu, to abolish the controversial pension and entitlements law of 2007, which approved the payments of pensions and other entitlements to former governors and their deputies, many state governors last night insisted that they were not ‘on the same page’ with the Lagos State helmsman on the issue. While some of these governors were unequivocal on their stand, others still went ahead to clarify that the Lagos State governor’s approach was exclusive to him alone. Saturday Telegraph further gathered that some neither supported nor kicked against the decision, arguing that it was purely the prerogative of the governor to decide how to reduce cost of governance. Sanwo-Olu had on Tuesday while presenting the N1.154 trillion 2021 budget estimates to the state’s House of Assembly for consideration and approval, hinted of plans to repeal the Public Office Holder (Payment of Pension Law 2007), which provides for payment of pension and other entitlements to former governors and their deputies. The governor said the bill would be sent to the Assembly for legislative approval, adding that the abolition of pension for former governors and deputies would reduce the cost of governance.

Lastly, expanding Medicaid to people with low incomes without a disability has resulted in easier access to treatment and also in our mental health providers and hospitals receiving payments for treatment. The percentage of people who are uninsured is now lower. Prior to Medicaid expansion, if people needed mental health treatment covered under Medicaid, they would have to prove they were disabled and couldn’t engage in gainful employment. It was disheartening to young people to have to say they couldn’t work in order to get the treatment that could help them get back to work. We see in the data that many people go on and off Medicaid expansion, demonstrating that having health insurance cover needed treatment can result in people working.

Control of the Senate remains up in the air, and the outcome could have a profound effect on whatever shape another stimulus bill takes. As of this week, the Democrats appear to have 48 seats and the Republicans 50. Georgia's two seats have yet to be filled, given a unique rule in that state requiring candidates to win a majority of the votes. No candidate in either race reached that threshold, sending each election to a runoff in early January. If Republicans win either race, the Senate will remain under their control. If Democrats win both races, the Senate will revert to their control, given that the Vice President casts the deciding vote in a tie.

According to the health department, the average daily case rate for the past week has been at 68.9, well above the 24 that puts the county in the red under current metrics.
 Anderson University, the only residential college in Madison County, will be putting in place its post-Thanksgiving plan for all-virtual instruction through the end of the semester starting next week.
 AU President John S. Pistole confirmed that university officials have decided that with the surge in COVID-19 around the nation, including in Madison County, it’s in the best interests for the health and safety of the students and staff to go all-virtual. The campus will remain open, but students will take their instructions from home or the dorms, where meals will be delivered.
 Concerned about the likelihood that some students would return to campus following Thanksgiving infected with the novel coronavirus, AU officials made the decision a few weeks ago to end the semester with all-virtual instruction.
 Madison County Health Department administrator Stephenie Grimes said she has fielded several calls from churches and other organizations over the past several days, but most want to know what they can do to move forward with plans rather than canceling or going virtual.
 “I say you are exempt but really think about your congregations. It’s not simply can we stay open, can we not?” she said. “There are some people scrambling who have some events this weekend. The order doesn’t take effect until Sunday, but I encourage people to make modifications sooner, if they can.”
 Local hospitals have seen an increase in admissions due to COVID-19, Grimes said. Preventing that from happening is the foremost thing that will prevent another complete shutdown, she added.
 “They’re holding steady. They are probably doing better than hospitals in other counties,” she said..
 It’s crucial to continue wearing masks, distancing and washing hands frequently to prevent the spread of the virus, Grimes stressed.
 “I’m pleading with this community, with this county to please, please, please, practice those safety practices,” she said.

Racism has existed on America’s soil since before it was founded. The videos and images of this past year alone haunt me at night. Do I believe that these elections will make racism disappear? Of course not. But I do have faith that Biden will not endorse White supremacy, and not call out certain communities in a derogatory way which fuels increased hate crimes and even fatal attacks — as we saw with our Asian American community after Trump coined COVID-19 the “China virus.”
 My hope is that communities will feel more seen and valued by the Biden administration, which has already promised to have an administration that will reflect all people.
 While there have been some wins, this election has shown that we are divided. We are hurt. We do not see eye to eye. I trust Biden will bring back grace, dignity and a moral code to the Oval Office. I also know he comes with a message of valuing diversity, belonging and inclusion, and will strive to make all people — regardless of sexual orientation, disability, race, gender, religion and more — feel valued, safe and appreciated.
 Thankfully, we can all agree on those three key values.

 # Our representatives need to stand up for our democracy
 Lore Roethke
 Minneapolis
 It was disheartening to read Congressmen Tom Emmer, Pete Stauber, Jim Hagedorn and Congresswoman-elect Michelle Fischbach are calling into question the integrity of the election. Scattered recklessly, these seeds of doubt and mistrust fall everywhere — including close to home.
 Who is responsible for the count of these “suspicious” votes? Who are these liars and cheaters?
 Stauber, Hagedorn, Emmer and Fischbach are talking about election judges and poll workers, civic-minded citizens in communities all over their districts and districts like theirs all over the country, people who stepped up to make sure that the process for fair and free elections in our democracy was followed in their villages, towns and cities.
 They are undoubtedly the same people who serve in many others ways in their communities: as youth sports coaches, 4-H leaders, volunteer firefighters, booster club members, etc. They serve church dinners and serve on school boards.
 Yet, Stauber, Emmer, Hagedorn and Fischbach undermine these same people — ordinary American citizens — by implying they are involved in an illegal count, accusing them of outright dishonesty. Why? Because they dare not question Donald Trump.
 Any person with an ounce of common sense knows that Donald Trump has no grounds for his accusations of voter fraud. If he had, he would have laid his cards on the table in his Nov. 5 press conference as former Gov. Chris Christie advised him to do. Instead, his rambling vitriol was so baseless that most major news networks pulled away before he finished.
 Every reasonable American knows that widespread accusations of voter fraud are the work of an unhinged bully, and I would bet that at three in the morning, when they are alone with their consciences, Stauber, Hagedorn, Emmer and Fischbach know this, too.
 Either they have lost all sense of their obligations as public servants in a democracy in the midst of the “Trump reality,” or, more likely, they are terrified that if they don’t fall in line behind Trump, they will end up on his “list.” They’ve seen him throw many politicians under the bus, and they don’t want to be next. This must be terribly intimidating.
 Now is the time for them to reflect on whether they are prepared to serve in a democracy. It is the time to find courage. By all accounts, this was a fair election, handled with integrity. Republicans, Democrats and international observers have concurred on this.
 If they truly mirror the values of Minnesotans, our congressmen and congresswoman-elect will take a stand and support the citizens in their districts and ordinary Americans all across the country who have worked hard to make this election process honest, smooth and successful. They will take the stand that the election is over; Biden has won and it’s time to move on and ensure that he is ready to govern our nation in January.

That was the first of six takeaways for the Spartans, who led 33-0 at the half and put the mercy rule into effect with their first possession of the third quarter.
 "I don’t think we played the best we could on offense," said Zechman, who also plays safety, "but when you put a bunch of plays like that together you can go up fast."
 Zechman intercepted a pass at the 20 on Lakeland's first offensive possession and linebacker Darren Brunner took a pick back 55 yards for a TD later in the opening half to make it 27-0.
 "They definitely came out a step slower on the fourth possession than they did the first," Zechman said of the Chiefs. "That’s when you capitalize, and Darren did a great job on that, with the pick six."
 In between there were a pair of Jordan Auman touchdown runs (36 and 16 yards), and finally Zechman's 24-yard TD pass to tight end Aiden Mack in the final minute of the first half.
 "They had that game from hell where the first three times you get the ball you fumble it," Wyomissing coach Bob Wolfrum said of the District 2 champion Chiefs. "There’s not a way you beat a team that’s even with you when you turn the ball over the first couple times you have it. I think we were better than them, but it made it easy when they just turned it over like that."
 The Spartans (8-0), ranked No. 2 in the state, have outscored their opponents 81-9 in the first half of their three postseason games.

Chad D. Hunt, 48, of 310 Westview Drive, Limestone, was charged Thursday morning by sheriff’s deputies with driving under the influence. Deputies went to the Pilot Travel Center on Baileyton Road about a pickup truck blocking access to a Dumpster with its engine running and a man “passed out” in the driver’s seat, Deputy Ricky May said in a report. The driver, identified as Hunt, began to wake up as deputies approached. Hunt had slurred speech and told deputies he had taken his sleeping medication about four hours earlier. He showed deputies a bottle containing Risperidone. Hunt showed signs of being under the influence during field sobriety tests. He was held on bond pending a first scheduled appearance Friday in court.
 A fence was damaged by a vehicle early Thursday in the 800 block of Brown Road, sheriff’s Deputy Luke Fields said in a report.

Then come the project preparation stage and the appraisal and approval of plans. Unfortunately, these grama sabhas, where people can collectively demand public action, are not being convened regularly. People are not enthusiastic about attending them either. As for development seminars, these are not held any more,” Prof Oommen said.
