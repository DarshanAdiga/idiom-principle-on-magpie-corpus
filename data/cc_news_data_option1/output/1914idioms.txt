When the brain is ready, the next 'way' is the understanding or dialectic stage. The brain has accumulated facts. It goes on to 'join the dots' and create structure in understanding these facts. We found that as our children developed the ability to read, they recognised the pegs of information they had learned in Foundations (eg, Genghis Khan, World Wars I and II, biomes, Newton, thermodynamics, the list is vast). In independent reading and shared reading, learning for keeps happens as the pegs of information are added to. The brain simply stores it away. This is how God made us. The fingerprint pattern of God applies even here too - the rule of the weight-lifter training his muscles towards strength through repetition applies to the memory master training his brain. The more training in memorisation, the easier it is. This preparation pays dividends through the teenage years and life. Imagine studying for exams with years of training in memory work!

Brown has been living at the Flat Creek Inn since early March and is one of only a handful of guests there. It’s cheaper than renting an apartment or house part time.
 “They’ve been great about keeping winter rates and letting us stay,” Brown said. “Or else I would have been screwed.”
 Kyle Eggett, manager of the Flat Creek Inn, said the hotel usually stops allowing long-term stays at the end of April but is extending them through at least June because those are the only guests they’ve had during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “We have had lots of cancellations,” Eggett said. “May so far isn’t looking good.”
 Several Jackson hotels like the Elk Country Inn and 49er have also extended their long-term stays for essential workers and business. Phones are ringing off the hook at their front desks, but it’s mainly guests canceling summer reservations.
 A manager at the 49er said the summer outlook is “looking pretty ugly.” A lot of their cancellations have been entire tour buses full of European visitors.
 For people like Brown, and his neighbor Dawnmarie Haines, who works in construction, hotels staying open during the pandemic has helped them keep their jobs.
 “It’s been so quiet,” Haines said. “Usually there would be cars lined all the way down the parking lot.”
 The average occupancy rates the last month or so have been 5% to 10%.
 Eggett said with no way of predicting what summer tourism will be like he’s had to try and guess how many seasonal employees to hire.
 They usually hire 33 summer employees and this year he said he will likely hire only 19.
 “Our seasonal staff need to know what’s going to happen,” Eggett said, “but we don’t know.”
 Eggett said everything depends on what the nearby national parks decide to do.
 “I anticipate once things open back up people will be out of money,” Eggett said. “There won’t be people looking for hotels, but some locals will be coming by who are going to the parks maybe.”
 Aside from occupancy being in the single digits, Eggett has had trouble getting his usual cleaning supplies for the few housekeepers still working.
 “I ordered wet wipes last month, and they won’t be here until June,” he said. “For us the biggest frustration is getting the chemicals we need.”
 The Flat Creek Inn is family-owned. It also has a gas station and convenience store next door, which has remained open.
 “Ownership has reassured me we will stay open. We are nimble enough to adjust where we need to, but we don’t have all the insurance that a big hotel chain would have,” Eggett said. “The other concern is we get through the summer and COVID-19 comes back.”
 The Wort Hotel, a historic staple of downtown Jackson, has taken state and local health orders seriously, General Manager Jim Waldrop said, which meant sometimes going against the hospitality mantra of making guests feel welcome.
 “When the governor sent out the essential worker order we did have to ask a small number of guests to vacate the premises,” Waldrop said. “We were committed to flattening the curve. We limited it to essential workers.”

On the opposite side of the "bowling alley lawn," she has planted a long, narrow bed of many plants, including spirea, dahlias, herbaceous peonies and a vine of white table grapes (Whalen uses the vines and fruit in her arrangements). This garden strip terminates at a raised bed used exclusively for tomatoes planted by Mike, before the property bends into the front yard.
 The front yard is shaped by a gentle, cascading hill to the street and centered by a wide staircase that was here when they moved in. Whalen has planted the front yard with color, and filled the pathways with scented blooms that show throughout the year. She wants to walk out her front door and see blooms and smell fragrance. At the top of the stairs, there are sweet box bushes, mahonia, a tall beautyberry, sweet alyssum, a star magnolia and Casablanca lilies — her business’ namesake bloom. “When people come to the studio or the house, I want them to be bowled over by the fragrance,” says Whalen.
 There are several heirloom roses from David Austin at the top of the hill — Mister Lincoln Rose is a favorite. The front yard is planted in a consistent ring of flowers — a new style that Whalen recently incorporated that mimics the circular shape of the farmhouse interior. _Brunnera_ ‘Jack Frost’, arbutus, _Sedum_ ‘Autumn joy’, muscari, tulips, alliums and more cover the hill to the sidewalk.
 With all the blooms and greens she grows, is Whalen feeling as if her yard is done? Not likely. “I have an addiction," she says. "I can’t stop.”

 Another compelling electric vehicle design, for a completely different context, is provided by Richard Kim, also a former BMW designer, who created the futuristic exterior of the electric BMW i3. In a sign of the times, he is also resisting passionate sports car shapes.
 “Functional design is a bit anti-car,” he admitted. “What does a customer really get from a cool fender flare?”

“I remember one guy told me that the fans would get up and walk out if I used too many [blacks]. But you know? We eventually had to rent the college gym because we had such a good following. The fire marshal had to lock the doors and turn [fans] away,” Williams told Lunsford in 1998.
 Indeed, Glenn often played games at Indiana State at the height of their powers.
 That doesn’t mean the racial persecution stopped. In many ways, it was as entrenched as ever. Fans tried to needle the Pirates into mistakes or fouls. Officials often turned a blind eye. Road games were often a battle against the crowd as much as it was against the opponent.
 “When I talk to youngsters in this day and age, and they talk about the way they are treated, they really don’t go through the racism we went through,” Session said. “We played in schools where, after we won the game, they threatened to fight us. They'd say, 'You might beat us playing basketball, but we can beat you fighting.'”
 The racism was unrelenting.
 “They called us everything. One year we went to Fontanet. One of their fans would sit right above us and rub his shoes against us all game," Session said. "We felt it had a spirit that we felt they could do what they want, they were trying to do anything they could to put us out. The more the fans did that? The harder we played. We got strong enough to where he just ignored it."
 The racial prejudice didn’t stop outside the gym. The Pirates’ black players were denied entry at restaurants. After one incident in which Williams hastily agreed to have Glenn’s black players enter through the back door with the team in a pinch, he finally had enough and said none of the Pirates would patronize any restaurant that didn’t treat all of his players equally.
 This policy was applied without exception. Bob Stephens, who grew up in Swalls and whose family ran a grocery store where Indiana 42 forks off at Swalls Drive, relayed one example.
 Glenn sought to have its postseason banquet at one of two prominent, long-time Terre Haute restaurants. Both agreed, but both said Glenn’s black players would have to enter through the back of the restaurant. Williams wasn’t having it. So he went somewhere who would have the Pirates and welcome them all as a team.
 “My dad [who sponsored the Glenn schedule at the time] told Jack he'd find them a place. He ends up going to Spencer to the Hilltop Inn. Owen County was where the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan lived at the time and that's where Glenn had its banquet. They said they didn't care. Bring 'em on out," Stephens said.
 That provided some rare levity for the Pirates at the time. The racism Glenn endured was not long for the world, but it didn’t end because of their success either. The phenomenal success of Crispus Attucks in the mid-1950s helped break down barriers on the court. Off-the-court? It took a lot more time.
 The racism that Glenn endured didn’t soften until all teams started using black players with regularity in the 1960s and 1970s, once society collectively concluded that overt racism was wrong. Glenn’s players paid a heavy price in blazing a trail to make the atmosphere better for the African- American athletes who came after them.

BRADFORD, Pa. — Twenty-seven consecutive wins, a District 9 championship, a win over the state’s No. 1 team and trip to the PIAA quarterfinals later, Bradford’s 1994-’95 basketball team put together a season for the ages.
 No Owls team has won 27 games since that year, and that win streak is likely the longest in program history. Only two Bradford teams have reached the state quarterfinals since that 1994-’95 season, and only one of those made it past that round — the 2003-’04 team that fell to Moon in the state Class AAA semifinals.
 Also in that season, the Owls snapped a 12-game state playoff losing streak and picked up the program’s first PIAA win since 1969. The 24-0 regular season marked the first time the Owls ran the table since doing so in the 1941-’42 season.

ATLANTA (AP) — As state after state begins to reopen, local health departments charged with tracking down everyone who has been in close contact with those who test positive for the new coronavirus are still scrambling to hire the number of people they need to do the job.
 They are often hundreds — even thousands — of people short of targets for their contact tracing programs. Public health experts have consistently said robust programs to test more people and trace their contacts are needed for states to safely reboot their economies and prevent a resurgence of the virus.
 Cook County, Illinois, has just 29 contact tracers serving 2.5 million people living in suburban communities around Chicago. Los Angeles County, which at more than 10 million people has a population slightly greater than Michigan, has just 400 of the estimated 6,000 contact tracers it will need under California’s criteria for a broader reopening.
 With 2.7 million residents and roughly 100 to 300 new COVID-19 cases a day, Miami-Dade County has 175 people tracking down people who were potentially exposed to the virus.
 “The whole point of the lockdown was to buy time to have a better way to keep numbers down,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the humanitarian response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa during the Obama administration. “And that’s why so many of us are screaming ourselves hoarse about testing and tracing.”
 Public health experts say contact tracing systems should be in place before cases become widespread, so every new infection can be tracked and the person's contacts identified, tested and isolated from the rest of the community.

Vietnamese flocked to scenic spots and beaches Saturday, leaping at the chance to travel as the communist government eases restrictions on domestic movement to revive a tourism sector devastated by the coronavirus.
 Hundreds waited to get on tourist boats to visit the famed karsts of the UNESCO heritage site of Ha Long Bay with few following social distancing norms.
 Most removed face masks as they climbed on board and posed for selfies.
 "This is my first time to Ha Long after COVID. I came here because there is so much beautiful scenery... and the COVID pandemic is gone so I feel safe," said Duong Quang Hieu, 21, from the mountainous northern province of Tuyen Quang.
 "I'm planning to travel to Danang and other places too."
 Vietnam has won plaudits for its fast and aggressive response to the spread of the coronavirus, which has so far kept infections down to 318 with zero deaths despite its long, porous border with China.
 But the swift closure of the country came at a cost. The tourism take plummeted to $340 million in the first four months of the year, according to government statistics, down 45 percent year-on-year.
 Doors remain closed to foreign travellers, but authorities are turning to the domestic market of millions wearied by long weeks of self-isolation and travel bans to get the tourist economy moving again.
 "It's nice to travel at this time. We have a wide range of hotels to choose from," said tourist Phan Van Kien from Hanoi.
 Kien said his family would travel domestically for the rest of the year with many international flights cancelled and fears still strong over the spread of the virus.
 The French-established Dalat city has also been packed with local holidaymakers since early May.
 In 2019, Vietnam received more than 18 million foreign travellers, the majority from Asia.

This is where the idea for Food Ferry, by Primal Alchemy Provisions, a dock- to-dock program to help feed Catalina was born.
 “People have been just giving us money and telling us to feed those in need, so we have been doing that," Dana Buchanan said. "I know that there are a lot of resources here in Long Beach that are supporting our community, then, I thought, Catalina is, literally, an island, cut off from the support we have on the ’big land.’ So, with the help of Dan Hunke, community services director of the city of Avalon and with permission from the Harbor Master in Avalon, we are going to give some love to the islanders.”
 Starting this week, the Buchanan’s will provide a boatload of prepared meals and with the help of volunteer boat owners ferrying the food over, the meals will go from Alamitos Bay Marina to the Avalon Pier — dock to dock.
 Some boaters with Catalina mooring are doing what they can to help Avalon’s economy.
 Long Beach’s Bob Blair took his family on board their boat to the island last weekend and said, “On Saturday while on a little coastal cruise we counted 57 boats on anchor between Frog Rock and Empire Landing. All island moorings are closed to transient boaters. Only the owners or Leases are being allowed to use ‘their’ moorings.”
 Blair also reported Avalon shops are open with limited hours, several restaurants are offering takeout, and the fuel dock is open with limited hours.
 Blair also noted the following, “Leo’s drugstore is open, line forms outside and minimum customers allowed in, the Island Toy Store +More was open and very well stocked for any 8-month-old grandson as well as for a kid at heart grandpa who still enjoys an Etch-a-Sketch and astronaut ice cream.”

Consequently, we published a story based on the probable cause statement but were not able to confirm the connection between that incident and the shooting mentioned by the Orem Police Department’s Facebook post (though we could make a good guess).
 A situation in which an officer-involved shooting occurs, but news agencies are unable to report on it until five days later, is unusual. Yes, we’re sure the situation is sensitive to the police, and that they wanted to make sure they communicated information about it carefully. But we’ve never seen a police agency refuse to make communication for several days after similar incidents in the past.
 The withholding of information by the Orem Police Department produced a lot of unnecessary and avoidable suspicion. To our best judgment, it seems the police handled the actual shooting incident reasonably well given the details we now have. The camera footage of the incident makes it clear the officer who fired his weapon was being charged down by a truck at that moment.
 So why all the secrecy? The police department inadvertently gave itself a black eye by not answering to the news media or the public with more immediacy.
 We would venture to guess that one reason behind the department’s lack of communication lies in the fact that there is currently no official Orem Police public information officer. Because that duty has not been delegated, the department’s officers often drop the ball when news media reaches out.
 Having a PIO at a police agency is highly important not just to communicate with news media but also so that the public has the information they need to judge the safety of their neighborhoods. We hope Orem Police gives that title and accompanying duties to an officer soon.

Klein understands this. The penultimate chapter of his book is devoted to cataloguing the asymmetries between the two major parties, and explaining why polarization has rendered the Republican Party an order of magnitude more dysfunctional than its adversary. Democrats’ inability to win national elections without bringing disparate social groups into common cause features prominently in his account. But _Why We’re Polarized_ never quite reconciles its clear-eyed indictment of “both sides-ism” with its own overarching frame. At various points Klein stipulates that polarization is not inherently bad, and that our present two-party system is preferable to the one that preceded it. “For all our problems, we have been a worse and uglier country at almost every other point in our history,” Klein writes. “For much of the twentieth century, the right to vote was, for African-Americans, no right at all. Lynchings were common…The era that we hold up as the golden age of American democracy was far less democratic, far less liberal, far less decent, than today.”

Even the presidential candidates are among those waiting for a decision about the Iowa State Fair, which with its giant butter cow, deep-fried Oreos and hordes of voters has become an integral part of the political campaign. Iowa officials said last week they would wait until June to decide whether the fair would open.
 For rural children in local 4-H and National FFA Organization clubs, the fair cancellations are a particularly painful blow. They have been tending their animals for months to prepare them for their turns in the ring at livestock shows.
 “It’s really frustrating that I will be missing out on all of my showing, and I won’t be able to have fun with all of my friends,” said Mia, a seventh grader who lives in La Center, Washington. “I have made some of my best memories at the fair.”
 Leaders of local farm clubs are trying to make up for the losses by hosting online livestock shows, asking children to submit photos and videos of themselves displaying their cows, sheep and goats. The children are filmed walking their animals and pointing out their features, which judges must scrutinize through a computer screen.
 “I don’t think anything will ever take the place of a live livestock show — the sights, the sounds,” said Ryan Rash, a popular livestock judge who has been donating time on children’s virtual shows. “But in this time of crisis, it’s all the kids have to look forward to.”
 Rash, an executive director for Texas Junior Livestock Association, is accustomed to running his hands down the side of cows to size up their fat content and to grasping the legs of sheep and goats to check for muscle definition.

Owner Lindsay Olson said her employees have been working out the most efficient method to produce masks and make the most of their materials.
 “We don’t waste much at Atmosphere when we’re doing our normal production, and it feels even more important now,” she said. “Materials can be scarce.”
 They ran into a snag as they considered what to use for a metal nose piece, which keeps the mask fitted to the wearer’s face. They couldn’t purchase the necessary pieces anywhere because all suppliers were sold out. They tried making nose pieces from wire but the process was too slow.
 As Richardson and Olson brainstormed solutions, they remembered WyoTech, Laramie’s automotive technical college.
 Jadeen Mathis, director of communication, said WyoTech had material on hand and the tools and expertise to cut metal nose pieces for about 1,000 masks. WyoTech instructors were available for the project because the school had yet to resume classes.
 “We love being a team player out here,” she said. “We love being a part of things like that.”
 Olson said the collaboration was an example of people with diverse skills contributing to a single effort.
 “They work in metals, where we do not,” she said. “They have the tools to make short work of something like that.”
 Meanwhile, Richardson contacted the Wyoming Technology Coronavirus Coalition, a statewide network of technology-minded makers. The group was organized in March by Eric Trowbridge, who leads the Cheyenne-based Array School of Technology and Design.
 Coalition member Tyler Kerr, makerspace coordinator at the University of Wyoming, used his equipment to cut fabric strips for the masks, while the coalition also collected requests from around the state to aid in distributing them.
 “It’s very cool to see so many people coming together to support each other right now,” Richardson said.
 The Wyoming Community Foundation also has a COVID-19 fund for nonprofits that are working with vulnerable populations. Funding is available to anyone in Wyoming, and the foundation has distributed more than $200,000 in the last six weeks.

The point is not that reasons cannot be adduced for this or that military product to not be on this list. But rather that such a course of action will be used by the armed services habituated to "buying foreign" to persist with this habit. As a result, even a modicum of self-sufficiency will be hard to achieve. Because it is certain the Services HQrs will fight tooth and nail to ensure that their main weapons platforms -- main battle tanks, combat aircraft, diesel submarines, helicopters and ballistic missile defence systems and the like, inclusive of their associated electronics, and systems and sub- systems, remain outside the negative list. It could, in effect, leave the country still forking out enormous amounts of hard currency to foreign suppliers even as the process to make India self-reliant stays unachieved.

MDC Alliance must not ring fence those who want to join the ZANU PF jamboree fronted by Thokozani Khupe , Douglas Mwonzora, Morgen Komichi and Elias Mudzuri. They must do so freely and there is no need to stop them.      You do not need a rocket scientist to tell you that they have been planted by the regime just to cause confusion. Members of Parliament who are ideologically bankrupt, unpatriotic and who do not know the cause should leave.      The majority of people should start wondering why the late Morgan Richard Tsvangirayi was finding it difficult to win all these years he contested. Of course allegations of rigging cannot be completely ignored but it is now crystal clear that there are machinations meant to scuttle and disturb every move, when the ball is just in the penalty area.      Members of the opposition who want to serve the people must be objective, self centred and pragmatic.      Those who want to go should do so in good faith. Like people who want to move from one house to another they should do so in broad daylight when all the people are watching. They should not cover their faces like Boko Haram which is about to strike.      The Bible says - "In the year that King Uziah died I saw the Lord". So such people must go for the people to get their freedom.      It is difficult for people to wrap their heads around the numerous ways of their lives, this entire country - would feel more stable, secure, and directed right, if people were allowed to vote for the leaders of their choice.      Right now there is chaos in MDC-ALLIANCE because of the implications of the judgment passed by the Supreme Court and the fundamental rights of the voters.      Voters are not experts in law interpretation and do not have a say in the judgment. Why did the nomination court allowed MDC-Alliance to register their name and later the Supreme Court sending another judgement two years later?      I have been closely watching how our courts are operating and I have concluded that we have lost the radar.

And yet, it was also Vigo County’s own who were often providing the racial heat, and on a lesser scale, demonstrated petty jealousy of Glenn’s accomplishments.
 Whether it was slurs hurled down from the bleachers? Whether it was foul- marred games allowed to carry on by indifferent officials and school administrators? Whether it was threats of violence after Glenn beat a team in its home gym? Whether it was underhanded tactics to “expose” Glenn by jealous and myopic coaches and administrators?
 Let this column be the proof – 70 years after the fact – that history will not be kind to those who would not stand up and do the right thing or stand up for those who were. Most of those guilty of the above transgressions are deceased, but their actions speak for themselves and were disgraceful.
 I think it's important to remember Glenn's important role in paving the way for a better, though far from perfect, racial climate we have today.
 Glenn’s story was pretty well-known in its time. The Associated Press, United Press International and the Indianapolis papers covered high school basketball very extensively in this era. It was known throughout Indiana that Glenn had an African-American star, Charley Session, but they were best known as the “people’s choice”, the tag given to small school teams who tried to beat the odds and make a run to win the then-single-class state championship.
 However, Glenn’s story was quickly forgotten. The Pirates didn’t make it past the semistate – thanks partly to a very ill-timed flu bug – and Session’s birth certificate controversy consigned them to the dustbin of being cheaters in the eyes of many.
 Session _was_ over-age – his 1993 obituary states his 1930 birth date.
 However, it seems to me that to hold Session’s age against Glenn for perpetuity is punishment that far exceeds the original crime. To say that Glenn’s legacy is tied to the use of an over-age player, great though Charley Session was, is a slap in the face to what they had already endured.
 On top of that? The investigation wasn’t exactly handled with grace.
 It is strongly rumored that the IHSAA was aware of Session’s age problem long before seven Vigo County principals initiated the investigation, and, before Glenn coach Jack Williams and Glenn principal George Bibich became aware of Session’s true age during a Selective Service visit in April 1951.
 Though never documented officially, Glenn observers claim IHSAA commissioner L.V. Phillips met Williams in the Bloomington Semistate locker room to warn him that the Pirates might be on borrowed time if they continued winning. Even if that Phillips-Williams encounter is apocryphal, the investigation the IHSAA itself put on-record doesn’t paint a pretty picture.
 Put yourself in Fannie Session’s shoes on June 2, 1951. She had claimed she named a child Charles who died shortly after child birth in 1930 and named her next son Charles afterwards. That was the original story she claimed to explain the discrepancies that had come to light in Charley Session’s birth date.

Immediately after the 2018 harmonised elections, Zapu in consultation with a number of Civic Organisations issued a statement calling for an all-inclusive dialogue that would culminate in the creation of a Transitional Governing Authority. As predicted, this was dismissed by ZanuPF and its partners. There were also those who expected some political miracles that would turn the economy around to appear from somewhere so to them a Transitional Governing Authority was a just a dream.      It is clear now, like never before that the regime preservation agenda of ZanuPF does not only condemn generations of Zimbabweans to some serious under development, but is now bent on dehumanizing the entire nation.      The truth is that the armed rulers have long ceased to be a democratic voice of the Zimbabwean people. Nowadays when a group of armed people seize power even indirectly, the democratic world simply refuses to respect it.      After losing the election in 2008, ZanuPF refused to follow the democratic path but manipulated the opposition into a Government of National Unity. While opposition members were hoodwinked into believing that they had achieved something, ZanuPF remained effectively intact and used the 5 GNU years to find strategies to preserve more power and destroy the opposition once and for all.

Nicole Bartelt has been a loyal fan at all but two of Borussia Dortmund's home matches since 2008, but when the Bundesliga restarts Saturday after a two- month hiatus because of the coronavirus, she will be forced to keep away from the stands.
 Nevertheless, Bartelt, 44, is not complaining that the derby with Schalke will be played behind closed doors.
 "It's better to have 'ghost games' to slow the epidemic than to have a health catastrophe," she told AFP.
 "Even if we detest Schalke, a season without such a derby doesn't have the same flavour," added Bartelt, wearing a black BVB jersey.
 Bartelt will be watching the game from her friends' place.
 Likewise, Marco Perz, 45, who has been a regular at Dortmund matches since 1987, will be at in front of the television at his friends'.
 "It's sad that matches are played in empty stadiums, but it's better than nothing -- the more we keep to health rules, the sooner we can return to normality," said Perz, with a beer in hand.
 It would be "absurd and dangerous" to not allow the season to run its course, said Perz, who was wearing a jacket emblazoned with a dozen Dortmund logos.
 "Not necessarily for the players, who may have to buy one less Lamborghini, but for the economy that depends on it -- the technicians, gardeners, fan shops. On a match day, some shops, including fast-food stands, rake in revenues equivalent to that of a normal week."
 Unlike typical match days when the city centre would be buzzing with fans, the atmosphere downtown this time was muted.
 Ahead of the match, police have sent out repeated appeals on Twitter, urging fans to stay home to enjoy the game.
 Police were in out in force, with several vans parked at the city centre and outside the main train station, with the twin task of stopping fans from assembling in large groups as well as to maintain order as anti-lockdown demonstrations are expected at the same time.
 While stay-at-home measures have largely been lifted, social distancing rules keeping no more than two families from mingling are in place.
 People are also required to stand 1.5 metres (five feet) apart, to avoid contagion of the virus.
 Likewise outside the stadium, the atmosphere was markedly calm.
 Only the occasional cyclists and people out for a stroll were to be seen while the shutters remained down over ticket-counters.
 The only signs that something may be stirring were vest-clad stadium staff wearing face masks standing at the main entrances and police patrolling.

WINTER SPRINGS, Fla. (WESH/CNN) -- A Florida man has been living for eight weeks on a cruise ship docked at an Italian port as he awaits negative coronavirus test results.“No day is fun, but some days are better than others,” Taylor Grimes said. “And then some days are just the absolute worst.”Taylor Grimes was working at a cruise ship jewelry store when all this started in mid-March when a friend of his on the cruise tested positive. Taylor Grimes also tested positive and now waits on the cruise for the OK to go home. He needs to have two negative tests in row to do so. However, his mother says that ever since his first positive test, his results have been maddening. “He’s been tested eight times,” his mother, Ann Grimes, said. “His test results have been positive, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive.”Now Taylor Grimes is waiting on the results of back-to-back tests this week. Results that his parents don’t really trust. “We have no confidence right now in the testing procedures,” Ann Grimes said. They also worry about their son’s wellbeing as his stay on the cruise gets longer and longer. “I am worried about him, not so much physically, because he hasn’t shown any signs of the virus,” his father, Tom Grimes, said. “But mentally he’s on a never- ending rollercoaster ride.”Tom and Ann Grimes are doing their best to support their son from afar. Tom Grimes is even letting his beard grow out like his son’s as a “small show of solidarity.” They even have a plan to celebrate for when he gets the green light to come home. They plan on having friends and family line the road, welcoming him home. In the meantime, they continue to work to lighten the mood. “Last night, we set up a picture of him with drinks and posted, ‘Having drinks with Taylor,’” Ann Grimes said. “We thought it was cute. He wasn’t as amused.”The family hopes that soon, they will be laughing together.Copyright 2020 WESH via CNN. All rights reserved.

Had Klein embraced a more forthrightly leftwing analytical frame, he might have given more space to the question of who owns the means of identity production. His account of polarization is largely dismissive of economic explanations for America’s present social strife. While he compellingly rebuts the argument that Trump supporters were motivated primarily by material anxieties, this scarcely establishes that the past four decades of upwardly redistributive economic policy played no role in bringing our republic to its present crisis. In a society whose richest 0.1 percent command as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, a lot of powerful people will be literally and figuratively invested in having Americans identify more as patriotic traditionalists than as exploited workers. One need not deny humanity’s innate affinity for in-group chauvinism – or pretend that white supremacy and nativism would disappear from this Earth the second the billionaire class does – to posit a relationship between the Republican Party’s plutocratic donor- base and its increasingly maniacal appeals to white racial paranoia, nor to observe that there are multiple corporate media outlets working round the clock to stoke white Christian America’s cultural resentments, and none working to cultivate the proletariat’s class consciousness. (Klein does have plenty to say about the role played by Fox News and other rightwing outlets in exacerbating polarization, but he attributes their incendiary programming choices to market incentives, despite empirical research suggesting that at least some conservative media companies are _sacrificing_ market-share to the higher good of disseminating reactionary propaganda).

The setting may be unfamiliar with the German Bundesliga returning behind closed doors after a two-month coronavirus shutdown, but the identity of the day's first goal-scorer was entirely familiar as Erling Braut Haaland put Borussia Dortmund ahead against Schalke.
 Haaland diverted a low Thorgan Hazard cross into the far corner of the net in the 29th minute for the first goal of the five matches kicking off on Saturday afternoon on the long-awaited comeback of top-flight football in Europe.
 It was a 10th goal in nine Bundesliga appearances for the prolific 19-year-old Norwegian striker, who moved to Dortmund from Red Bull Salzburg in the winter.
 Usually the scorer of the first goal in the Ruhr derby -- one of the biggest fixtures in German football -- could expect to be mobbed by his teammates.
 On this occasion, though, Haaland's colleagues respected social distancing recommendations and avoided getting too close as they applauded the smiling and dancing goal-scorer.

The announcement by Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman that there would be a "ban" on imports of armaments was music to my ears and meant that something I have long been advocating had finally come to pass. This was so until she qualified her remark by adding that the Defence Ministry would produce a negative list of weapons systems whose imports are barred and that there'd be deadlines for each of these items from when this ban will come into effect. So an escape hatch has been left open for the armed services to continue sourcing their high-value hardware/software requirements and keeping them out of this list. Should the Services fail to convince the defence ministry on this, they will no doubt endeavour to extend the deadlines so that most of the arms import transactions in the pipeline come in under the wire.

 For now, Florida, Michigan North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin anchor the map as the five most competitive states that combined to deliver Trump’s 2016 victory. In North Carolina, Democrats also are targeting GOP Sen. Thom Tillis while Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper seeks a second term.
 Michigan Democratic Chairwoman Lavora Barnes, whose state gave Trump his closest margin of victory four years ago, said an influx of money is “critical” to boost what the state party already has done since 2016 to “elect Democrats … in every corner of the state.” Michigan flipped its governor’s office and several congressional districts in the 2018 midterms.
 Ohio made the cut as well, with Democrats asserting that Trump’s nearly double-digit margin in 2016 was an aberration, not a sign of a more permanent shift.
 Minnesota and New Hampshire are states Trump believes he can flip. Colorado has moved steadily toward Democrats in recent years and Republican Sen. Cory Gardner faces a difficult reelection.
 O’Malley Dillon has singled out three GOP strongholds as part of an “expanded map” reflected in the fundraising deal. Arizona, Georgia and Texas have seen demographics shifts and progressively closer statewide elections in recent years. Arizona and Georgia combine to have three Republican-held Senate seats on the ballot, as well.
 Alabama, Mississippi and West Virginia stand out as heavily GOP states that won’t be close in the presidential election. But all three have notable Senate races. Democrats are defending incumbents in Alabama and West Virginia, states that Republicans view as potential pickups.
 There are notable omissions: Iowa and Maine, for example. Trump scored a comfortable victory in Iowa four years ago, but Democrats in the state have since flipped two congressional districts and are hoping to oust Republican Rep. Steve King in the fall. Maine is home to GOP Sen. Susan Collins, one of Democrats’ top targets as they try to regain the Senate.

Mark Casse and other trainers at Woodbine Racetrack finally have a thoroughbred racing season to prepare for.
 Woodbine Entertainment is full steam ahead with its plans to offer both harness and thoroughbred racing in 2020. Harness racing,suspended in March due to COVID-19 pandemic, is scheduled to resume June 5 at Woodbine Mohawk Park with Woodbine Racetrack's thoroughbred campaign opening June 6.
 Racing at both venues will be conducted without fans.
 The pandemic forced Woodbine to postpone its scheduled April 18 start to the thoroughbred card.
 "It (Woodbine) is very important to us," Casse said. "We have many horses that we've targeted for this meet that haven't done anything.
 "But this is even more important for the owners and trainers who've been up there since December and haven't been able to run. I'm much more concerned about those people because with this virus, many businesses have been put off for the last couple of months but technically horse racing has been off since December so it's much greater in my opinion."
 Woodbine isn't alone. As a result of the pandemic, thoroughbred racing in the U.S. was relegated to a handful of tracks, including Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla., Turfway Park in Florence, Ky., and Fairmount Park in Collinsville, Ill.
 Racing at Santa Anita Park was scheduled to resume Friday without fans.
 Casse is one of North America's top trainers. The 59-year-old native of Indianapolis has won both the Preakness and Belmont Stakes — the final two legs of the U.S. Triple Crown — as well as five Breeders' Cup races.
 Woodbine has also been good to Casse, who's been named Canada's top thoroughbred trainer an unprecedented 11 times. His horses have recorded two Queen's Plate titles, two Woodbine Mile crowns and three Woodbine Oaks victories at the Toronto oval.
 And Casse said Woodbine's tapeta surface will make it easier on returning horses.
 "The great news about Canada and Toronto is if they were faced with the same situation and the racing surface was dirt it would be much harder," Casse said. "The good thing about tapeta is horses get over it so easily that their fitness level doesn't have to be as great to run.
 "It's so much kinder on the horse and it enables you to run them sooner because it doesn't demand as much. That's a big, big plus."
 And so is being able to get more of the horses in his stable up and running.
 "We've been able to run a few at Gulfstream but if the virus hadn't hit we probably would've run another 75 horses," Casse said. "So I have 75 horses that have continued to train but haven't been able to run.
 "For me, when we're not running we're losing money."
 And Casse cautioned that applies to all horse-racing operations.
 "The way our operation works, what we get every day for the care of our horses doesn't cover the expense," he said. "We have to earn money.
 "I'm not in any way, shape or form whining about it, but just for instance in April/May last year I think we won $3.5 million in purses. If we're lucky in those two months this year, it's been about $500,000."
 Casse also said the situation could always be worse.
 "I feel for the poor restaurants," he said. "So many people have been hurt and it's no fault of their own.
 "When people make dumb mistakes, you think, 'You know what? You made your bed, you're sleeping in it.' In this case nobody did anything wrong."
 Casse said the pandemic has also impacted how he trains horses.
 "Yeah a little bit.," he said. "Normally we'd be on a heavier work schedule maybe every six or seven days.
 "We went to 10-to-14 days but now we've started cranking them back up and we're ready. We're fortunate we have a training centre to do all that."
 But a drastically reduced racing schedule has provided a nice plus for Casse.
 "I'd be lying if I said I haven't enjoyed being able to stay at home with my wife, Tina, and son, Colby," Casse said. "Colby is a pretty good baseball player and he's got better because we practise a couple of hours a day.
 "Normally at this time I'll have been on a plane 12 times in the last six weeks. I was supposed to go to Dubai, that got cancelled. I had a trip to New Orleans, I would've made four, five trips to Kentucky and a couple of trips to Toronto. I'm getting much more time at home, which is very nice."
 Earlier this month, Casse was named for induction into the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame, fulfilling a prediction he made growing up to his father, Norman, who died in 2016.
 "It's probably the biggest honour I've ever achieved," said Casse, who was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2016. "We've won many big races in many different places and been very fortunate but this says, 'Hey, you're one of the best in your field.'
 "I think you always want to gain the respect of people in your field. It's a tough game and nobody likes to give you much credit but when you go and see I have a horse running, I just want you to think you've got to beat him. That's what I mean by respect."

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Ernie Gonzalez, who spent four years on the PGA Tour and won the rain-shortened Pensacola Open in 1986, has died. He was 59.
 The PGA Tour said he died Friday in a Chicago hospital of Alzheimer’s.
 Gonzalez played 119 events over a four-year span from 1985 through 1988, when he finished 207th on the money list. The Californian's lone victory was in 1986 when he made five birdies and an eagle over his final nine holes of the second round for a 63 and a one-shot lead. But the 36-hole final because of rain was wiped out, and Gonzales was the winner.
 His largest payoff was $48,000 for a tie for third in the Vantage Championship, two weeks after his victory in Pensacola. That tournament was cut to 54 holes because of bad weather.
 Gonzalez played at least one PGA Tour event every year through 2003. He also worked at a beverage distributorship in Las Vegas. His lone PGA Tour Champions event after turning 50 was the Senior British Open in 2011. He missed the cut.

With 2.7 million residents and roughly 100 to 300 new COVID-19 cases a day, Miami-Dade County has 175 people tracking down people who were potentially exposed to the virus.
 “The whole point of the lockdown was to buy time to have a better way to keep numbers down,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the humanitarian response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa during the Obama administration. “And that’s why so many of us are screaming ourselves hoarse about testing and tracing.”
 Public health experts say contact tracing systems should be in place before cases become widespread, so every new infection can be tracked and the person's contacts identified, tested and isolated from the rest of the community.
 Until recently, there had been scant federal guidance on what contact tracing should look like, and there is still no coordinated federal strategy. While other countries are taking a national approach to contact tracing, the U.S. is leaving it to states to devise their own programs.
 The result has been a patchwork of efforts. An AP review in late April found little consensus among states on basic questions such as how many investigators are needed.
 Officials in Cook County, which has the highest number of cases in Illinois outside of Chicago, have said they need at least 200 additional contact tracers and as many as 400 to supplement the work of the 29 currently on staff. Illinois has maintained a statewide stay-at-home order since late March, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said the state needs a “massive statewide contact tracing operation.”
 “The county cannot open safely if additional contact tracers cannot be hired in a timely manner,” said Hanna Kite, spokeswoman for the county health department.
 On Monday, Miami-Dade County will begin to allow restaurants and stores to resume limited operations, joining the rest of Florida in an initial reopening. It's unclear when the county — the state’s most populous and by far hardest-hit by COVID-19 — plans to bring on more contact tracers to assist the 175 staffers doing the work now.
 “In Miami, we need definitely more than we have, but so far we have been able to manage the amount of cases that we have to maintain a balanced activity in terms of contacting all the positive cases,” said Dr. Alvaro Mejia-Echeverry, a state epidemiologist for the county.
 Contact tracing was one of the “core state preparedness responsibilities” outlined in the White House guidelines for reopening the country, but governors have been pressing ahead with lifting restrictions without having comprehensive programs in place.
 Hall County, which has over 200,000 residents and the second-highest rate of coronavirus cases in Georgia, has between 30 and 40 contact tracers assigned to the local public health district, which also serves a dozen neighboring counties. It hopes to receive an additional 30 from the state.

And won't these foreign firms also insist on 'one window' clearance for all permits, local level up, so they don't get mired in red tape and are compelled to function at the sufferance of some defence production babus as Indian companies are forced to do? And further, will the potential investors not demand that the land acquisition be simplified and facilitated which will need the centre and the state governments to be on the same page?

As “rumors and misinformation” circulate online about coronavirus quarantine orders around Washington, the state Department of Health clarified Friday that people won’t be forced to participate in contact tracing and enforced quarantines are a rare measure used only by local health districts. Gov. Jay Inslee added Friday — in a reversal of his controversial order earlier this week — restaurants will not be required to record diners’ names and phone numbers after all, which was an initial guideline that aimed to aid in contact tracing should any patron test positive for coronavirus.
 Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Friday vowed to use “every plane, truck and soldier” to distribute COVID-19 vaccines he hopes will be ready by year's end. The goal is to have 300 million doses in stock by January, a huge gamble since a vaccine never has been created from scratch so fast — and one that could waste millions if shots chosen for the production line don't pan out.

Even the presidential candidates are among those waiting for a decision about the Iowa State Fair, which with its giant butter cow, deep-fried Oreos and hordes of voters has become an integral part of the political campaign. Iowa officials said last week they would wait until June to decide whether the fair would open.
 For rural children in local 4-H and National FFA Organization clubs, the fair cancellations are a particularly painful blow. They have been tending their animals for months to prepare them for their turns in the ring at livestock shows.
 “It’s really frustrating that I will be missing out on all of my showing, and I won’t be able to have fun with all of my friends,” said Mia, a seventh grader who lives in La Center, Washington. “I have made some of my best memories at the fair.”
 Leaders of local farm clubs are trying to make up for the losses by hosting online livestock shows, asking children to submit photos and videos of themselves displaying their cows, sheep and goats. The children are filmed walking their animals and pointing out their features, which judges must scrutinize through a computer screen.
 “I don’t think anything will ever take the place of a live livestock show — the sights, the sounds,” said Ryan Rash, a popular livestock judge who has been donating time on children’s virtual shows. “But in this time of crisis, it’s all the kids have to look forward to.”
 Rash, an executive director for Texas Junior Livestock Association, is accustomed to running his hands down the side of cows to size up their fat content and to grasping the legs of sheep and goats to check for muscle definition.
 Now, he can only scroll back and forth through images to compare animals’ body shapes. It is laborious, he said, and presents new challenges.
 “Just like on body builders, you can see muscles pop, but not being able to put your hands on animals — it’s different,” said Rash, who also co-hosts the podcast “Beyond the Ring.”

"It's one thing to be the sidekick of like Starman, but then to become the sidekick of my stepdaughter, who's a high school sophomore, and we go from having this relationship where we're just trying to get along as parent and child, and then suddenly she's kinda like my boss," Wilson detailed. "That was one of those things where, you know, it was in the script, but then when she and I would do these scenes together, I think we both wound up kind of having fun with the comedic aspects of it."

Gonzalez played 119 events over a four-year span from 1985 through 1988, when he finished 207th on the money list. The Californian's lone victory was in 1986 when he made five birdies and an eagle over his final nine holes of the second round for a 63 and a one-shot lead. But the 36-hole final because of rain was wiped out, and Gonzales was the winner.

 The 2018 second-round pick threw a football over a two-story house from the backyard, ran threw the open doors of the garage and made an impressive over- the-shoulder catch on the run in the driveway.

The ultimate aim of education for the Christian is to see the fingerprint of God in every single thing. It was a revelation to me, in mathematics for instance, that we can teach our four-year-olds to learn the axioms such as the Identity Law, the Distributive Law, the Commutative Law and the Associative Law. Having learned this by heart, when the time for algebra hits in later years, our students are equipped to apply the law to gain understanding. Simply learning a process keeps him a slave to the process as he can only work the problems within limited parameters. However, when he learns a maths law, he can try applying this to solve a multitude of maths problems. The fact that such maths certainties (laws) exist is a fingerprint of God, which the first two models cannot reveal (for he does not feature). Furthermore, the simple message behind this is also a Biblical truth. The law is the way to freedom.

 Matches will be played behind closed doors and players and coaches, who have been in quarantine for the past week, must follow stringent hygiene guidelines.
 In the highlight of six matches on Saturday, Borussia Dortmund host Schalke 04 in the Ruhr Derby at 1330GMT, a fixture that would normally attract an 82,000 crowd to Signal Iduna Park.
 Professional football returned to western Europe earlier in the day as the second-tier Bundesliga 2 resumed with four matches at 1100GMT.
 South Korean Lee Jae-Sung scored the first league goal in over two months when he gave Holstein Kiel a third-minute lead at Regensburg.
 Although Germany has suffered far fewer deaths from coronavirus than other large European countries, it is still too dangerous for crowds to return.
 On Sunday, Bayern Munich will resume their quest for an eighth successive Bundesliga title when they play in the capital against Union Berlin.
 Bayern were four points clear at the top of the table when the season was suspended in March. An exciting Dortmund team featuring Norwegian striker Erling Braut Haaland and highly-rated English forward Jadon Sancho are in second place.

Mays, his back to the plate, sped toward the outfield wall and snagged the ball over his shoulder into his underhanded glove at a full run. (His cap, of course, falls off at the end.)
