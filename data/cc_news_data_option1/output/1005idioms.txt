The decline has been driven by investors shifting money out of the stock market and into the safety of U.S. Treasurys as the crisis in confidence around the global viral outbreak has worsened. Long-term mortgage rates tend to track the yields on the 10-year Treasury note, so they typically fall in tandem.

For the past 12 years I have lived next-door to a remarkable woman. When I moved in, my son was not even a year old and she welcomed us with open arms. There was a sincere warmth that we immediately felt.  
 Throughout the course of the years, I have had the pleasure of developing a personal relationship with her and her family. After raising four boys of her own, it was second nature to her in accepting my son and he adores his "Grandma" next door. Children are a good judge of character.  
 In my position, I see a different side of her than most. I can assure you that she has been nothing short of a mother, mentor, a friend, and a woman who takes pride in everything that she does. She generally cares for people, her community, and her track record has proven that she is always willing to step up to do what is right and fair for anyone.  
 Most of you know her as (Medina County) Commissioner Geissman, I, however, know her as Pat Geissman. I am extremely grateful that she is my friend, second mother, "Grandma" to my son and my commissioner. She's the kind of neighbor you can borrow a cup of sugar from.
