Ozil has not played a single minute for the Gunners since March 7, having initially been a mainstay of the team following Arteta’s appointment last year.
 “This is a difficult message to write to the Arsenal fans that I’ve played for over the past few years,” Ozil wrote in a statement posted on social media.
 “I’m really deeply disappointed by the fact that I have not been registered for the Premier League season for the time being.
 “Upon signing my new contract in 2018, I pledged my loyalty and allegiance to the club that I love, Arsenal, and it saddens me that this has not been reciprocated.”

 Arteta’s side face Rapid Vienna away in their Europa League opener on Thursday night and the Spaniard took full responsibility for Ozil’s absence as he said only football reasons were taken into account in making the decision.
 “Everybody is free to express his feeling,” he said.
 “What I can say from my side is that it is just a football decision. My conscience is very calm because I have been really fair with him.
 “My level of communication with him has been really high and we know what to expect with each other.
 Upon signing my new contract in 2018, I pledged my loyalty and allegiance to the club that I love, Arsenal, and it saddens me that this has not been reciprocated
 “Obviously a player of that dimension, with the career he has had, everything that happens around him has a big impact. It has been the case for the last eight years, it is nothing new that is just happening now. A lot of things have happened over these eight years.
 “My job is to get the best out of every player, to contribute to the team performance. Here I feel at the moment, today, that I have failed.
 “I want the best possible Mesut for the team. And in some moments I was able to get close to that, and at the moment I have not been able to do it because I have to make the decision to leave him out of the squad.”

Smith Countian’s have an opportunity to safely and securely dispose of potentially addictive prescription medications at the upcoming National Prescription Drug TakeBack Day. The event is set for Friday, October 30 from 1-5 p.m. at the Carthage Walmart. Take back events offer an opportunity for anyone to properly dispose of medications that are no longer needed or expired including potentially addictive prescription opioids. The annual take back event in April was derailed by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but local community groups and law enforcement agencies that team up to host take back events have adapted to the pandemic protocols necessary to make the October event safe and effective for everyone. During the take back event in October 2019, Tennesseans safely and securely disposed of more than 26,000 pounds of medications at 145 collection sites “We know that COVID-19 is causing increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress, and for some people, that is leading to increased use of substances. When you combine that with the availability of potentially addictive medications in the home and everyone spending more time at home, you have several risk factors all in one place,” said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams, LCSW. “Participating in a prescription drug take back is an easy and effective way that anyone can take a positive step toward addressing that risk by decreasing access to medications that can be misused.” If you or a loved one are struggling with the disease of addiction Call the Tennessee Redline 1-800-889-9789 for help. For people who are unable to participate in a take back event, there are drop boxes located at Carthage City Hall and the Smith County Sheriff Department. These boxes are placed in partnership with local law enforcement and disposal is coordinated through the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. For any questions call the Smith County Drug Prevention Coalition 1-615-588-1622.

Airbnb has hired former Apple design chief Jony Ive to work on showcasing the homesharing platform's forthcoming products, it announced Wednesday.
 Ive, who worked alongside Steve Jobs for several decades, is credited with designing the shape of the iMac, iPod and iPhone before leaving the tech giant in June 2019 to set up his own firm, LoveFrom.
 The Silicon Valley legend and his firm "will be engaging in a special collaboration" over the course of several years with Airbnb, founder and CEO Brian Chesky said in the announcement.
 Ive will also help Airbnb develop its internal design team.
 "We share the same belief in the value and importance of creativity and design," said Chesky, himself a graduate in industrial design.
 "We each believe not only in making objects and interfaces, but in crafting services and experiences," he said.
 The announcement comes as Airbnb plans to go public by the end of the year.
 Shaken at the start of the pandemic by measures put in place to stem the spread of Covid-19, Airbnb has managed to weather the storm with users turning to the platform to book nearby weekend getaways or search for a new location for working from home.

“This race is far closer than some of the punditry we’re seeing on Twitter and on TV would suggest,” read a memo last week from Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon. “In the key battleground states where this election will be decided, we remain neck and neck with Donald Trump.”
 But even some Republicans have begun talking about a possible drubbing in a second Blue Wave that would power Biden to a huge Electoral College victory and help Democrats retake the Senate.
 Last week, one Republican, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, warned constituents of a possible “Republican bloodbath” in November, earning the ire of the president in the process. Conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch has told friends he expects Biden to win in a landslide, according to a published report he did not deny.
 Biden’s campaign has also stepped up travel to and investment in states that were expected to be out of reach for Democrats — sending Jill Biden to Texas and scheduling events for Sen. Kamala Harris and her husband in Georgia and Ohio before a staffer tested positive for coronavirus and her travel schedule was limited.

BROCKTON -- "Art is our protest" is their motto.
 "Unity through art" is their mission.
 Brockton is their home.
 And their latest project is a collaboration with a company owned by Tom Brady.
 Power of Art, a new collective of Brockton creatives, kicked off a series of public projects this June with a mural showing seven fists of different colors raised in unison, painted onto the exterior wall of Champion Ice Cream on Legion Parkway.
 Lindsay Loza, a painter and portrait artist, said the group formed less than a month earlier with the goal of creating opportunities for Brockton artists to respond to widespread protests over racism in law enforcement.
 "Our job is to reflect the times," Loza said.

 The upcoming collaboration with TB12, Brady's sportswear and nutrition brand, offers the collective its broadest platform yet to help Brockton artists share work centered on social justice in the city. TB12 advertises internationally and maintains nearly 400,000 followers on Instagram, using Brady's unparalleled achievements as a quarterback in the National Football League to sell athletic gear, prepared meals and nutritional supplements.
 In what company executives called "a chance to take a stand on social justice," TB12 plans to manufacture and sell the Brockton-made designs through its online store, donating the proceeds to nonprofits in the city.
 In September, Power of Art and TB12 announced an open call for design submissions. Several local fashion brands have been contacted to participate as well.
 "Bigger than just apparel and inspired by Brockton imagery, the contest promotes social justice, determination, empowerment and community pride," Power of Art said in a written statement.
 "In an effort to stand against racial injustices afflicting communities of color, Brockton residents are challenged to submit t-shirt designs that embody these values."
 A panel of Brockton artists and TB12 executives plans to choose as many as three winning designs in November. Ollie Spears, a former city council candidate whose personal ties to Brady's company made the competition possible, will have a say in the choice as well.
 Once the designs from Brockton are screenprinted, the shirts themselves could direct attention from TB12 customers toward a city that was once famous in its own right for manufacturing athletic gear.
 Growing up in Brockton, Loza said she rarely saw artists work together on public projects.
 "We're trying to create a new culture here," she said.
 The collaboration breaks new ground for TB12 as well, marking the first time the company has crowdsourced designs from local artists.
 "This is completely new for us, very much unlike anything we've ever done before," said TB12 marketing specialist Drew Bradley. "It really feels like the right time to take this kind of action."
 Power of Art has six members, including Loza, the group's founder. Barbatt Jocelyn and Tricia Seda, who run Massive Media, a Brockton brand consultancy, are members. Salena McAlarney, a tattoo artist and illustrator, joined at the outset, as did Jamaal Bonette, a painter, and Roland Gilbert, Loza's boyfriend.
 The collective has several public art projects on the horizon, including a mural for Empower Nutrition, a Black-owned smoothie business on Brockton's Crescent Street.
 The artists share their work on personal Instagram pages and a separate account for Power of Art's group projects.

The USD remains the strongest and the AUD is the weakest of the majorsThe USD remains the strongest of the major currencies, while the AUD is the weakest. That puts the AUDUSD as the biggest mover. The pair is currently trading down -0.37% on the day. It outpaces the USDCAD which has moved 0.22% (and is the 2nd largest % mover on the day).Technically, looking at the hourly chart, the story was much different yesterday as the pair raced higher on the back of hopes for a stimulus deal and a more positive technical picture. The pair was able to get above its 100 day moving average at 0.7103, and race to and through its 200 hour moving average and 50% retracement near 0.7130. However momentum could not be sustained as US stocks started to ease off toward the close, and buyers turned to sellers.In the new trading day, the price has now breached below its 100 day moving average once again (at 0.7104). Stay below that moving average level keeps the sellers more in control. The next downside target will have traders looking toward the underside of the broken trend line at 0.7082 followed by the 100 hour moving average at 0.70786. A move below the 100 hour moving average would added to the bearish bias.Yes, the run higher yesterday was impressive. However, today is a different story so far with levels are broken to the upside yesterday being rebroken to the downside today. That has traders battling for control. I would give the nod more to sellers (the price below the 50%, the price is below the 200 hour moving average the price is below the 100 day moving average) with additional targets on the downside to get to and through to tilt the bias even more to the downside.For bank trade ideas, check out eFX Plus

HINGHAM - The goals for the Hingham High boys cross-country team had to be modified for this season because of what's happening with the pandemic.
 "We are trying to take each week as it comes. With all the COVID modifications we have to be very careful and try to protect the team," Head Coach Fred Jewett said. "This keeps our goals more closely aligned to the Patriot League schedule. We don't know if we will have a League Meet but there are no MIAA postseason meets this season in any sport."
 An early-season meet against Plymouth North had to be canceled so the Harbormen have had only two opportunities to race so far this fall. They've picked up a win over Duxbury and lost to Whitman-Hanson. Races that are still remaining on the schedule include Marshfield (Oct. 22), Silver Lake (Oct. 29) and Plymouth North on Nov. 5.
 The Harbormen have 38 runners in the program and the team captains are Noah Sharp, Kevin Ierardi and Sean McCay. Jewett praised their leadership skills, saying "we are in the best condition we've been in the last 10 years" because of the running they've done since the spring. Other top returning runners are Matt Hall, Tom Shetzline, Charley Donahue and Leo Burm.
 Junior Steve McDougle, a first-year runner, has been a great addition to the team and has slotted into the first spot in the running order. Donahue, a sophomore, has stepped up to take over the second spot.
 "Charley's emergence has been a nice surprise," Jewitt said. "He has a great future ahead of him."
 This season has been a challenge for everyone but Jewitt said he and the team are trying to make the best of it.
 "I want to thank my assistant coaches and the captains for being incredibly vigilant about masks and social distancing. There are so many restrictions that it is difficult to do many of the workouts that we used to do but everyone is highly motivated and trying to win despite the terrible conditions," Jewett said. "I applaud all the runners and coaches for the extra care and enthusiasm at this stressful time. We fight to stay healthy every day."
