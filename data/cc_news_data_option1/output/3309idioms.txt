At the end of the day, Secretary Esper decided to nominate Jim Dickinson.

Bayer Leverkusen vs Rangers live stream, BT Sport 2, Thursday August 6, 5.55pm BST Rangers lost the first leg of this last-16 clash 3-1 at home back in March, meaning they need a minor miracle to progress. Bayer Leverkusen are a superior side on paper and, with three away goals to rest on, will fancy their chances of reaching the last eight. If one man knows a thing or two about producing magic when all seems lost, though, it's Gerrard. Expect Rangers to throw everything at their German…

The news comes as the Kremlin confirmed that President Vladimir Putin is not scheduled to discuss Navalny's condition with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. _" No, he is not planning this,"_ his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in response to a question from a journalist on whether the two leaders would directly address the subject.


  Navalny, a well-known anti-corruption activist in Russia and a leading figure in the Moscow protest movement, is currently on a ventilator at the hospital. He remains in a coma although his condition is said to have _" improved"_ overnight.


  On Thursday, a plane with Navalny on board, en route from Tomsk to Moscow, made an emergency landing in Omsk, because the activist had suddenly felt unwell.


  On Friday, the medical team in Omsk said they were leaning towards a diagnosis of a _" metabolic disorder."_ Navalny's associates believe he was poisoned while drinking tea at Tomsk airport. However, doctors say no traces of poisons were found in his blood or urine.

He does appear to be right, but the claim that neither were present in training yesterday as well is false – they were both pictured at the training camp.


  Divock Origi was also absent, but he hasn’t trained with the squad for a few days now.


  With that considered, it’s probably safe to assume the trio will be absent for the Reds’ game against Stuttgart.


  Predicting the starting team for a pre-season fixture is especially difficult, but I’ll do my best:


  Adrian is likely to start in goal, with Alisson making a cameo in the second- half, as Jurgen Klopp keeps one eye on the Community Shield next weekend.


  The back four will probably be Neco Williams, Joe Gomez, Nat Phillips and Kostas Tsimikas, with the senior-most players being kept fresh.


  A midfield trio of Fabinho, Curtis Jones and Naby Keita seems likely. Up top, I predict we’ll start with Takumi Minamino, Sadio Mane and Rhian Brewster.


  Billy Koumetio is more than likely to get the nod at some point too, with the youngster training with the senior team in Austria, and Harvey Elliott too.


  There will be a lot of rotation throughout the game, so I can say with near- certainty, if the players I’ve mentioned don’t start, they’ll feature.

"On the Rocks", il primo trailer del nuovo film di Sofia Coppola

A movie can do a lot of things to an audience. It may move them, amuse them, disgust them, terrify them, or in all too many cases bore them. One thing only a handful of films can do is inspire wonder. Every once in a while, a winning combination of writer, director, designers, composers and cast meet in perfect harmony. Such, I feel, is the case of Marcel Carné's 1945 epic romance, _Les Enfants du Paradis (Children of Paradise)_.

As Prof. Shaw noted, Biden opened with the words of Ella Baker and portrayed himself as an "ally to the light" and this election as a fight for the "heart and soul of this nation." Like him, the argument was an old-fashioned and familiar, but Biden's delivery and his personal biography - his wife and baby daughter were killed in 1972 and his son Beau died of a brain tumor in 2015 - sold it. He spoke movingly of his grief and despair. Just as he had recovered from tragic loss, a Biden presidency would bring the U.S. out of "this season of darkness." Biden would redeem others because he, himself, had been redeemed.
