The resulting EP comprises undeniable anthems steeped in anthemic riffs, wild harmonica, and pulse-pounding drums. From the bluesy blend of “So You Wanna Change The World”, to “the first song we ever wrote,” the dynamic “Looking For An Old Friend”, The Georgia Thunderbolts rustle up a new era of rock ‘n’ roll on their dynamic five song EP. The seven minute-plus “Set Me Free” rolls from a hummable riff towards evocative soloing and an epic final crescendo, while “Lend A Hand” stomps along on a wild lick before a sweeping and soaring refrain.

Pelosi on Thursday told her colleagues that Trump’s presence on the ballot this year made it more difficult to retain some of the seats they flipped two years ago.
 “In 2018, we won 40 seats. We went deep into Trump districts when Trump was not on the ballot. But clearly with Trump on the ballot, we knew it would be a steeper climb,” Pelosi said on the call. “So far, of the 30 districts that Democrats currently hold that Trump won in 2016, we have won or are ahead in 70% of those races.”
 Among those losing Tuesday was Democrat Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, a water rights lawyer in a rural New Mexico district. She was defeated in a rematch against Yvette Herrell, a Republican former state legislator who tied herself closely to Trump. Oklahoma Democrat Kendra Horn lost her suburban Oklahoma City district to Stephanie Bice, a Republican state senator, who criticized Horn for not standing up to Pelosi in Washington.
 The losses threaten to reignite familiar intra-party fighting between progressives and moderates, a battle Democrats cannot afford with a narrower majority. On the Thursday call, moderate members who lost, or nearly did, blamed their progressive colleagues, saying the talk of “defunding the police” or “banning fracking” was used in attack ads during the election.

The community board voted in favor of passing the 56 budget requests 30 to five. Six members abstained from casting their vote.
 Board member Barbara Gillespie questioned the status of 13 budget items that were included in the “continuous support” section, meaning some effort toward bringing the projects to fruition had already begun, but had not yet been completed.
 “Is there any way to somehow track the date when the item was actually suggested? Have some of these things been on here for years?” she asked.
 Chairperson Michael Budabin said that certainly many have been on their request list for years, but the length of time a request takes to be fulfilled doesn’t matter in the long run.
 “That may not necessarily be an issue ... Things take time,” said Budabin, but he agreed that there could be more engagement with city agencies to follow up on projects that take years to install.

NUEVA YORK (AP) — Después de varios meses en cines con una dinámica alterada por la pandemia, “Tenet” de Christopher Nolan será estrenada en formatos caseros el 15 de diciembre, informó Warner Bros. el jueves. “Tenet” estará disponible en Blu-ray, DVD y 4K justo a tiempo para la temporada navideña potencialmente poniendo punto final a su turbulento y peculiar paso por cines. La película sigue siendo el único gran estreno de Hollywood que ha probado las aguas de las salas en la era del COVID-19. “Tenet” ha logrado sumar 350 millones de dólares en taquilla a nivel mundial, pero tuvo problemas para impulsar la asistencia doméstica a los cines después de estrenarse el 3 de septiembre. Se enfrentó a un aforo reducido y cines que seguían cerrados en algunos estados. El estreno de Warner Bros. ha sumado hasta ahora 53,8 millones de dólares en las taquillas de Estados Unidos y Canadá. “Tenet” nunca se pudo presentar en Los Angeles o Nueva York, los dos mercados más grandes del país, que siguen cerrados. En su novena semana en cartelera en Estados Unidos, “Tenet” sumó 885.000 dólares en 1.601 locales el fin de semana pasado. Nolan afirma que ese resultado, ante las circunstancias actuales, no fue tan malo, pero tras el debut de “Tenet”, junto con el aumento de casos de virus en Estados Unidos y Europa, otros estrenos de gran presupuesto optaron por no hacerse en 2020. “Me preocupa que los estudios están sacando las conclusiones equivocadas de nuestro estreno en vez de ver dónde ha funcionado bien la película y cómo puede eso darles a ellos el muy necesitado ingreso. Están viendo lo que no cumplió con las expectativas pre- COVID y comenzarán a usarlo como una excusa para hacer que la exhibición asuma todas esas pérdidas de la pandemia en vez de entrar al juego y adaptarse...

Others in close races have said the failure to reach a compromise with Republicans to pass a coronavirus stimulus relief bill hurt them.
 For two years, Pelosi has navigated the competing needs and demands of progressives and moderates. Oftentimes her top priority has appeared to be protecting the moderates, whose 2018 wins gave Democrats the majority again.
 Despite prodding from progressives, she refused to bring up legislation to endorse Medicare for All or massive climate change protections — mostly to protect moderates from having to defend such a vote. She resisted calls to impeach Trump that started nearly the day he was inaugurated until a handful of moderates with national security experience said they were on board. In the end, however, those efforts weren’t enough to help all of the vulnerable Democrats.
 Bustos blamed bad polling for the disappointing losses, according to people on the call. She promised a postelection postmortem would be completed. Some have quietly indicated it would be best if she doesn’t seek another term leading the party’s campaign arm.
