While at times reading her work feels like getting a set of cheat codes for life (the way that having an epiphany in therapy can feel), Smith also takes pains to remind her readers that it’s hard to permanently reroute your anxiety, and that all of this will take a lot of practice, trial, and error. Even though I’ve heard a thousand times that it’s futile in the long run to rely on praise from big achievements to feel good about yourself, for example, it is always helpful to hear it again. In the final book chapter, Smith writes, “Can you think of anything less sexy than the idea that change is slow and difficult and requires a lot of contact with your family?” I cannot!

Houseplants can have us gardening year-round. They add a decorative touch to a home, and they emit oxygen and help remove toxins to purify the air.      Shopping for your first houseplant or adding more to your collection can be an exciting experience. How does one choose a houseplant? I look for ones with interesting texture, foliage and form. More importantly does it appear healthy. Here are some tips when shopping for a houseplant and for maintaining it.      • CHOOSING A PLANT - Look for plants with healthy green foliage and dense, bushy growth. One with an abundance of closed buds is a better choice than one in full bloom. Always check for insects at the tips of new branches, at the places where the leaves join the stems and on the underside of the leaves.   • LIGHT - Plants grown only for attractive foliage require less light. Succulents or cacti and flowering plants require direct sunlight. Succulents and cacti do make ideal houseplants since indoors the humidity is dry, and they prefer that kind of environment.   • SPACE - Plants grow at different rates. For immediate gratification in a small area, Norfolk Pine, Dracena Marginata, Fiddle Leaf Fig tree, Schefflera and Rubber Tree are some serious contenders for making a statement in a small space.   • INDOOR TEMPERATURE - Many houseplants are tropical in origin, so they prefer high humidity. If you are in a climate where humidity is low indoors, you can raise the humidity several ways. Misting plants, keeping pots on water-filled trays or grouping plants near one another to trap existing moisture can help raise the humidity for houseplants.   • WATERING - The biggest problem is overwatering houseplants. Choose a container with good drainage. Add water to the top of the soil surface until water comes out the drainage holes. Or watering can be done by placing the pot into a container filled with water and leave it remain in the container for fifteen minutes. Tepid water is best for watering to avoid shocking plants and causing them to wilt.   • FEEDING - Read the care tag on the plant for fertilizing and keeping your plant healthy. If you are unsure about the feeding of a particular houseplant, experts at your local garden center or floral shop should be able to provide answers to your questions.   • MAINTENANCE - Plant foliage should be rinsed under a gentle stream of tepid water about every two weeks to remove dust or dirt. Larger plants may be harder to rinse, so with a soft, clean cloth, gently wipe the foliage. As you wipe the leaves, use your other hand to support the undersides of the leaves.   Keeping me company in my home are a variety of houseplants. They all have interesting foliage, texture and some even flower. A mini cactus, a dracaena, an English ivy, a bromeliad, an orchid, a kalanchoe and a bird's nest fern comprise my indoor garden.      Maybe you too will find a spot on your kitchen windowsill for a small succulent or an empty space for a beautiful orchid beside your bedside. Houseplants will reward you daily.

DUBAI -- Iran said on Saturday its military had mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian plane killing all 176 aboard, saying air defenses were fired in error while on high alert in the tense aftermath of Iranian missile strikes on U.S. targets in Iraq.
 Iran had previously vigorously denied bringing the plane down. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who until Saturday had kept silent about the crash, said information should be made public.
 Wednesday's crash heightened international pressure on Iran after months of friction with the United States and tit-for-tat attacks. A U.S. drone strike had killed a top Iranian military commander in Iraq on Jan. 3, prompting Tehran to fire at U.S. targets on Wednesday.
 Canada, which had 57 citizens on board, and the United States had both said they believed an Iranian missile brought down the aircraft, although they said it was probably an error.
 "The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake," Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote on Twitter, promising that those behind the incident would be prosecuted. "My thoughts and prayers go to all the mourning families."
 Experts said mounting international scrutiny would have made it all but impossible to hide signs of a missile strike in any investigation and Iran may have felt a U-turn was better than battling rising criticism abroad and growing grief and anger at home, as many victims were Iranians with dual nationality.
 In Twitter messages, angry Iranians asked why the plane was allowed to take off with tensions in Iran so high. The plane came down when Tehran was on alert for U.S. reprisals in the hours after Iran launched rockets at U.S. troops in Iraqi bases.
 Iran's Revolutionary Guards apologized to the nation and accepted full responsibility. Senior Guards commander Amirali Hajizadeh said he wished "I could die" when he heard the news about the incident, state media reported.
 Responding to Iran's announcement on Saturday, Ukraine demanded an official apology and compensation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would work "to ensure a complete and thorough investigation" and wanted Iran's full cooperation.
 Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter that "human error at time of crisis caused by U.S. adventurism led to disaster," citing an initial armed forces investigation into the crash of the Boeing 737-800.
 TELL-TALE SIGNS
 A military statement said the plane flew close to a sensitive military site of the elite Revolutionary Guards. At the time, planes had been spotted on radar near strategic sites leading to "further alertness" in air defenses.
 Ukraine has said the plane was in a normal flight corridor.
 Experts said a probe would almost certainly have revealed tell-tale signs on the fuselage remains of a missile strike.
 "There's nothing you can do to cover it up or hide it," said Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board investigator. "Evidence is evidence."
 Former U.S. Federal Aviation Administration accident investigator, Mike Daniel, told Reuters the mounting evidence made it inevitable that Iran would "accept culpability."
 The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Mobile phone footage posted and circulated by ordinary Iranians on Twitter after the crash had indicated the plane came down in flames and exploded as it struck the ground.
 Aviation experts said Iran and the airline would have to explain why the plane was allowed to take off, as it is up to a country to close its airspace when there is a security risk, while many other airlines were already avoiding Iranian airspace.
 PUBLIC GRIEF
 Iran's initial denials this week had described accusations that a missile was to blame as "psychological warfare."
 Grief-stricken Iranians complained on social media that Iran's authorities had spent more time fending off criticism than sympathizing with victims' families.
 "Why were any civilian airlines flying out of Tehran airport in those conditions?" Twitter user Shiva Balaghi wrote.
 A U.S. official had said data showed the plane airborne for two minutes after departing Tehran when heat signatures of two surface-to-air missiles were detected. There was an explosion in the vicinity and heat data showed the plane on fire as it fell. U.S. military satellites detect infrared emissions from heat.
 U.S. President Donald Trump said this week that "somebody could have made a mistake."
 Iran had said on Thursday it would download the information from voice and flight data recorders, known as black boxes, to determine what had happened, although it had said the process could take one to two months.
 Tehran had said it could ask Russia, Canada, France or Ukraine for help in the investigation.
 The disaster had echoes of an incident in 1988, when the U.S. warship USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner, killing 290 people. Washington said it was a tragic accident. Tehran said it was intentional.

Spoiler alert: It’s not really snow.
 The white puffs drifting to the ground are basically soap suds, shot into the sky by powerful air blowers stationed on the roofs of nearby buildings. The wintry effect has become a must-have holiday feature for malls, zoos, theme parks and tourist attractions across sunny Southern California.
 Just don’t ask how this stuff is made.
 The snow-making entrepreneurs enjoying the surging demand for fake snow are tight-lipped about the ingredients, the ratio of water to soapy additive and the equipment used to spread it.
 “We can’t talk about the formula,” said Mike Giles, president of Global Special Effects, who boasts having produced artificial snow for “every major theme park you can think of.” He compared divulging his snow formula with asking Colonel Sanders to disclose the 11 herbs and spices in Kentucky Fried Chicken.
 The first rule of snow-making is you don’t talk about snow-making.
 Big tourist attractions and shopping malls also keep mum for fear of shattering the illusion that the drifting white stuff is created when tiny ice crystals in clouds stick together to form snowflakes — and this might raise pesky questions about how the foam is really made.
 But part of that secret formula has leaked out through documents that the snow makers must produce under federal rules. More on that later.
 Artificial snow has been used to create a holiday atmosphere at theme parks and malls in Southern California for nearly two decades, but in the last few years the call for faux snow has surged as improved snow-making technology has come closer to simulating the real thing.
 The International Assn. of Amusement Parks and Attractions expo in Orlando, Fla., this year included 13 companies that make imitation snow, up from 10 such businesses two years earlier.
 Disneyland, Universal Studios Hollywood and Legoland in Carlsbad have been featuring faux snow for many years. Among those adding snow effects in recent years are Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, the Citadel Outlets mall in Commerce and the Queen Mary in Long Beach.
 When accompanied by seasonal music and colorful lighting, the falling fluff is a magnet for holiday shoppers — especially young Californians who rarely come in contact with the real deal.
 “The consumer has a number of choices where they can shop, and we want to make our experience the best,” said Julie Jauregui, senior vice president for retail operations and leasing for Caruso, the real estate company behind several shopping centers featuring fake snow, including the Grove, Palisades Village in Pacific Palisades and the Americana at Brand in Glendale.
 During a recent tree-lighting celebration at Universal Studios Hollywood, Stephen Siercks, the park’s senior director for entertainment, supervised as hidden blowers spewed artificial snow on a crowd assembled in front of a six- story-tall Christmas tree. An actor dressed as the Grinch helped power up the lights.
 “The story of Grinchmas calls for snow and atmospherics,” Siercks said.
 But he declined comment when asked about the chemical solution that made the foam, the number of gallons used and which snow contractor was hired.
 Universal Studios Hollywood loves the effect so much that this year the theme park added falling snow inside of a retail outlet that specializes in Harry Potter merchandise.
 Fake snow has been a staple of Hollywood moviemaking for decades. Special effects experts say the first use of soap suds as a stand-in for snow was the 1946 holiday classic “It’s a Wonderful Life.”
 Before then, snow was replicated in films with cornflakes painted white. But the sound of actors stepping on the crunchy flakes was so loud that the dialogue had to be redubbed later.
 Russell Shearman, one of the special effects artists working on “It’s a Wonderful Life,” solved that problem by creating a mixture of water, soap flakes, sugar and foamite, a material used in some fire extinguishers.
 Shearman won an Academy Award for his snow effect and laid the groundwork for today’s snow biz.

World number two Karolina Pliskova will defend her Brisbane International title after edging Naomi Osaka in an epic three-set semi-final at Pat Rafter Arena on Saturday.
 Pliskova triumphed 6-7 (10/12), 7-6 (7/3), 6-2 win in a two hour, 48 minute marathon and will play eighth seed American Madison Keys in the decider.
 She was forced to come from a set down, then save a match point at 5-6 in the second, before seeing off the reigning Australian Open champion.
 The two are no strangers to long matches against each other -- Osaka edged Pliskova 6-4 in the third in the Australian Open semi-finals on her way to the title.
 But few could have expected a match of this quality and length in the first tournament of the year.
 With both players serving exceptionally well, the first set almost inevitably went to a tiebreak, which Osaka clinched on her fifth set point.
 The second set was a repeat of the first with few opportunities to break until Pliskova faltered at 5-5 to give Osaka the chance to serve for the match.
 She came from 0-30 down to 40-30, but Pliskova rallied, saved match point and then broke Osaka to send the set to a tiebreak.
 Osaka then saw the third set slip away with two service breaks.
 "That was one of the best matches that I've played on this court," Pliskova said.
 "It was a great standard, and she's always tough to play against.
 "I think I did a good job to stay in there after a tough first set, and in the second I just kept fighting and it paid off."
 In the first semi-final, Keys held firm when it counted to defeat two tie Wimbledon champion Kvitova 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 and make her first Brisbane final.
 After losing the first set and being down an early break in the second, Keys began to serve more effectively and find her range with her groundstrokes against an increasingly nervous Kvitova.
 From 0-2 down and staring a semi-final exit in the face, the eighth seeded Keys broke back to make it 2-2 and surged ahead to level the match.
 Both players struggled to hold serve in the final set -- there were five service breaks in a row -- but at 5-3 Keys held her nerve and from 0-30 she won four points in a row to become the first American into a Brisbane final since Serena Williams won the title in 2014.

And then - to run away, in a jump, return Leviathan to the hand and chop on the ground, causing a large ice explosion. Beauty! True, sometimes you forget that the enchanted ax does not live its own life, and because of this you get stuck in stupid situations, but, as for me, this is a plus. More impressions.

(Two days later, Collins apologized for his remarks.)

The AJK Mass Communication Research Centre at Jamia Millia was at the top of my list for more pragmatic reasons. It was a newer addition to the university set up in collaboration with York University, Canada, and unlike most other film courses which were diplomas, it offered a Master’s programme with a strong component of technical training and state of the art equipment. I had saved up enough to pay the first semester fee on my own if my father refused to let me go.
