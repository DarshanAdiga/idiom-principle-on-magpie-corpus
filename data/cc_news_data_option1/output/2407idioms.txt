Screw that. I’d rather leave my bed messy and go straight to my French press.
 In addition to only liking one way of making my coffee, I like coffee from certain places.
 Now that I’m a more experienced coffee connoisseur I’ve had the experience to try coffee all around the United States and here are some of my favorite places. (They are in no particular order)
 Starbucks — Everywhere
 There’s just something about Starbucks that I can’t shake. It’s cheaper than other coffee places and always tastes better than what I brew at home. Also, they’re everywhere.
 Biggby Coffee — Almost everywhere
 This is the best place to go if you want coffee and something to eat. Although there aren’t a lot of locations in Indiana, every time I see one, I gotta stop.
 Fuego Coffee Roasters — Rochester, NY
 Fuego is one of those coffee shops that you could spend 10 hours in and not even realize. Not to mention they’re pet friendly. Even though its brick and mortar store is all the way in upstate New York, their online shop has their roasts to buy. My favorite is the bear claw blend.
 Five Lakes Coffee — Kendallville
 I discovered Five Lakes Coffee when I started my internship. This small coffee shop dangerously close to my office is my new go-to place when I need coffee in Kendallville.
 Mocha Lounge — Fort Wayne, IN
 The Mocha Lounge is the place you go to work on homework and forget how long you’ve been there. Their big selection of drinks gives you many choices if you’re a new coffee drinker.

Normally at this point in the sports calendar in the US, the baseball season is starting to hit its stride, the NBA and NHL playoffs are in full swing and the US Open and Wimbledon are coming up fast. With the coronavirus pandemic suspending or outright canceling sports in the US and around the world, sports fans are left to find alternative entertainment, play video games or get in shape because of all the bread we're baking.
 If you're starved for live sports, you have a few options, as some sports have returned. NASCAR has resumed racing, and professional baseball from Korea can be found on ESPN. If stock cars or the KBO don't do it for you, can I interest you in German soccer? The German Bundeliga is the first major soccer league to resume its season, and you can watch games live today on Fox Sports.

The downside to this is that while Apple can tweak or update many of its first-party apps to run on ARM, it could take extra time additional time to adapt more complicated apps like Final Cut Pro, not to mention the countless third-party apps where outside developers might not be so quick to adjust. And while initiatives like Catalyst can help port ARM-based iOS apps over to Macs, that won’t be a magic bullet for everything.
 But the bigger problem comes when you consider the Mac Pro desktop, which just got released late last year. Generally, x86 chips with their Complex Instruction Set Architecture (CISC) are better equipped to handle more intensive tasks like video editing or 3D modelling than ARM-based chips with their Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture. That problem could force Apple to maintain multiple versions of macOS, with one designed to support high-end x86-based systems like the Mac Pro, while also developing an ARM- based version of macOS for less powerful machines.
 However, with recent additions to iPadOS like native mouse support and accessories like the Magic Keyboard and its built-in touchpad, iPad Pro has become a totally viable alternative to a typical MacBook for a lot of people. So in the long run, it’s possible that iOS/iPadOS will become the foundation of Mac computers, with macOS being reserved mostly for high-end systems before being phased out completely in four or five years (or more).
 Compared to macOS, it feels like Apple spends much more effort refining iOS and iPadOS. With combined sales of the iPhone and iPad responsible for nearly 60% of Apple’s revenue in Q4 2019 versus just 11% for Mac, it just makes more sense to invest resources into what is already Apple’s most popular OS, rather than trying to keep macOS going forever or split its attention between multiple forks. Furthermore, iOS and iPadOS already work well with a number of input methods including mouse and keyboard, touch, and stylus, which isn’t really true of macOS and brings me to my next point.

No more. The storm changed all that. Now, about a solid acre of woodland was laid wide open. It’s littered with downed trees that are scattered across the forest floor.
 When she looks at it, Arnold is at a loss for words.
 “It’s not supposed to look like this,” she finally said.
 The storm that pummeled Maple Wood and the eastern half of LaGrange County packed sustained winds of up to 90 mph. It was a storm that meteorologists say is fairly common in Indiana, a thunderstorm with high-end winds.
 Had the storm been larger, and affected a greater area, it would have been called Derecho, defined as a long-lived large windstorm, said Mark Steinwedel, a staff meteorologist with the National Weather Service of Northern Indiana. “I’m not sure this storm had that kind of reach to meet the definition of a Derecho because it was more localized across Indiana and into northwest Ohio and southern Michigan.”
 The storm did more than just knock down a large number of trees at Maple Wood. It felled dozens of mature maples, including several that were growing near the nature center. Several trees toppled and blocked off the entrance to the park.
 Those have been removed.

Maple Wood wasn’t the only park to be damaged in the storm. Dallas Lake Park and Delt Church Park also saw a significant number of trees felled by the storm. Parks department crews were able to quickly clean up Dallas Lake and Delt Church and reopen those parks, but Maple Wood is a different story. It may take more than a month to undo the damage and make the park safe for visitors again.
 “Maple Wood did suffer a lot of damage due to the storm,” Arnold said. “The driveway and the building itself are clear. But the trail system is another matter. It’s closed and will remain closed for the foreseeable future.”
 Windstorms like the one that rolled across the area and hit Maple Wood can do as much damage as a small-scale tornado, Steinwidel said because wind storms present a bigger risk for injury because of how big of an area they cover. He warned people to take large storms like the June 10 storm seriously and follow the same precautions as they would for tornado including sheltering in a basement or a small interior room.
 “When you get a 70 or 80 mph wall of wind coming through, it’s going to do the same damage as a lower-end tornado will do, only it’s more widespread,” Steinwidel explained.
 Back at Maple Wood, the nature center is back in business, and events scheduled there are going ahead as planned.
 But the trail through the woods is a different story.
 “We walked back the day after it happened, and honestly, we’re still in shock,” Arnold said. “It’s hard to comprehend the level of damage.”
 Now the park is having a problem with storm visitors.
 “I’ve watched people walk right around the caution tape,” Arnold said. “Please resist that temptation. There are a lot of widow makers in the woods right now, a lot of trees that are precariously stacked on top of one another. For everyone’s safety, please stay away for right now. We understand that a lot of people are really invested in this property. Believe me, it’s breaking our hearts as well, but for their safety, we’re just asking people to resist the temptation to come here and check it out.”

Aside from multiple Apple executives having previously stated that they simply aren’t interested in making a MacBook with a touchscreen, another big reason that makes creating a touchscreen Mac so difficult is the OS itself. macOS’s current UI just isn’t designed for touch. Things like icons and menu settings are too small to easily adjust with fingers, and while Apple could certainly redesign macOS to work better with touch, it would probably be a long and painful process, something Microsoft found out the hard way with Windows 8 and even into Windows 10. Instead, it would might be easier and more successful in the long run to scale up iOS/iPadOS to better accommodate desktop use.
 Now at this point, a lot of people could question the need for a touchscreen Mac when the iPad Pro already exists, which is fair. But when you combine a 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard, you end up something that weighs three pounds, which is actually heavier and less sturdy than a 1 kg MacBook Air. Also, with just a single USB-C port, an iPad Pro isn’t always a great choice as a primary work machine.
 So for a lot of Mac users, it would at least be nice to have the option of getting a super-thin laptop with a touchscreen (or hey, maybe even a convertible 2-in-1) instead of being forced to go with a heavier and bulkier iPad Pro.

According to Wyscout, he won three interceptions and 100% of his defensive duels before the break, but those numbers fell to zero and 25% after the restart.
 That may reflect City’s growing control on the ball as Arsenal tired from the relentless chasing and pressing.
 Ceballos certainly wasn’t unique in showing signs of fatigue against a City team with a one-man advantage in the second half, not least after an enforced three-month break thanks to the coronavirus crisis.
 That said, even before Luiz’s sending off, Arsenal’s midfield struggled to match City’s use of the ball and struggled for creativity.
 Arsenal ended the match with zero shots on target and, where City switched between fantastic long passes from deep and short, sharp, one-touch moves, Arsenal’s midfield three of Ceballos, Guendouzi and Joe Willock made little impact going forwards.
 In the first half, before Arsenal were forced to revert to an almost entirely defensive stance, Ceballos attempted nine forward passes, five passes into City’s final third and one through ball, which was more than either Willock or Guendouzi.

Conventional wisdom would suggest that Booker’s platform is far too radical for a bright red state that’s elected Mitch McConnell five times. But data suggests that Kentuckians support progressive climate policy such as phasing out of fossil fuels by 2050. And as Tuesday’s primary election draws closer, that seems to be playing out. Booker recently garnered a slew of high profile endorsements, and polls show him surging past McGrath.
 Since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was first elected in 1984, he’s been a constant source of anger for environmentalists. From voting in his first term to limit Clean Water Act enforcement, to bashing the Green New Deal last year and teaming up with Trump to pack the courts with climate-denying judges, he’s consistently worked to prevent meaningful environmental action. The League of Conservation Voters gave him an abysmal 7% lifetime score on environmental policy.
 But Moger says Booker’s candidacy offers a chance to do more than unseat McConnell.
 “It’s about electing a progressive champion who is already fighting for the people of Kentucky and building a grassroots movement with a diverse and dedicated coalition,” she said.
 Against Booker, McGrath is pitching herself as the safe choice. But amid the climate crisis, centrism is by no means safe. Climate scientists have made it clear that to avert catastrophe, world leaders will need to make radical changes. That’s why Booker is pitching a transformative vision for the environment and the economy. And according to the latest polls, many Kentuckians may be ready to get on board.
 In the end whether or not that transformative vision can beat out a moderate Democrat or a powerful five-term Republican incumbent remains to be seen. But in the face of the ever-worsening climate crisis, we have no choice but to try.

 For the first time in 2020, the Wabasso Jaxx amateur baseball team participated in live baseball action, as they travelled to Sacred Heart Sunday (June 14) to take on the Saints in an afternoon contest.
 Solid defense kept the game within reach, but the Jaxx were unable to come up with timely hits at the plate, and they were defeated by a score of 6-0.
 With the fate of amateur baseball in Minnesota still up in the air this season, this contest was considered an exhibition and did not count towards league standings.
 For the time being, Wabasso will continue to play exhibition games until further guidance from state and league officials.
 The game might not have officially counted, but it gave the Jaxx an opportunity to build on their progress in year two of the franchise.
 Kyle Lechner started on the mound for Wabasso, pitching the first three innings and surrendering three runs. Ryan Liebl then came in to pitch for a couple of innings, before he was relieved by his brother, Devan Liebl.
 Jaxx newcomer Leo Meis was the fourth and final pitcher to take the mound for Wabasso.
 The Jaxx struggled to find a rhythm on offense, but they threatened to score on several different opportunities. Kenric Baune delivered the first hit of the year for the team, lining a sharp single to right field in the second inning. Devan Liebl immediately followed with a line-drive base hit of his own, but neither runner came around to score.
 Later on, Steven Marotzke laid a perfect bunt down the third base line to reach on an infield hit.
 Wabasso was unable to take advantage with runners on base, however.
 The highlight of the team's performance was the defense. Wabasso turned two double plays in the game that helped get them out of several jams.
 CJ Theis, Carter Guetter and Bryant Haas all made exceptional plays in the field to keep the game within reach.
 At the end of the day, however, the Jaxx were defeated 6-0.
 Wabasso collected four hits in the game and committed two errors. The team has no plans of slowing down.
 Wabasso recently hosted the Heron Lake Lakers in its first home game of the year. It was the first ever match-up between these two franchises.

As for applying sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, here, too, the time has come to decide what we are doing with the settlement enterprise and the half- million Jews who live in Judea and Samaria—and who were sent there, by all Israeli governments. This is the land of our forefathers, the land where the people of Israel and its culture were created, and therefore, we must apply sovereignty there as well, at least in the so-called large settlement blocs. In the same breath, we must declare that this doesn’t mean we have ceded, heaven forbid, our rights to the rest of the land. Just as when we applied sovereignty over Jerusalem in 1967, we didn’t declare that we were giving up all the rest.

LOGROÑO, 20 Jun. (EUROPA PRESS) -
    A escasas horas de entrar en la fase denominada como 'nueva normalidad', la presidenta del Gobierno de La Rioja, Concha Andreu, ha querido apelar a la "responsabilidad de los riojanos" porque "cerramos una etapa y abrimos otra" en la que "debemos seguir dando ejemplo" para evitar posibles rebrotes de la enfermedad.
    Concha Andreu ha comparecido, junto a todos sus consejeros, para dar a conocer algunas de las condiciones que regularán esta nueva normalidad que entrará en vigor a las 00,00 horas de este domingo para enfrentarnos a "una nueva realidad" que es "la que nos va a tocar vivir hasta que no tengamos una vacuna que permita hacer frente al virus".
    El Decreto que se ha aprobado para entrar en esta nueva fase se publicará en el BOR esta misma tarde junto con diferentes guías de uso y protocolo para ayudar a la ciudadanía ante posibles dudas.
    Entre esas novedades, la presidenta ha destacado que "contaremos con un sistema de rastreo de casos positivos y de detección precoz que nos deberá garantizar aislar cualquier brote que se produzca de la manera más rápida posible".
    Además, la orden permite a la Consejería de Salud establecer nuevas restricciones por razones sanitarias, si se producen rebrotes.
    La presidenta ha recordado que "hay que mantener siempre que sea posible la distancia de seguridad interpersonal de metro y medio y, sino, habrá que usar mascarilla". Generalizaremos el lavado de manos en cualquier situación y se intentará estar en lugares ventilados. "Son recomendaciones sencillas pero muy eficaces".
    Por tanto, ha indicado, "mi consejo: Siempre la distancia de seguridad, siempre mascarilla, siempre higiene y siempre sentido común".
    Para el decreto aprobado, Andreu ha reconocido que "hemos aplicado los principios de prudencia, proporcionalidad y seguridad para preservar la salud de todos".
    En el decreto también se ha regulado la recuperación de la actividad económica y social "al máximo posible en estos momentos". En este punto, ha avanzado, "siempre que sea posible mantener la distancia de seguridad de metro y medio no existirá límite de aforo, sino se puede garantizar, mascarilla y aforo al 75 por ciento".
    "Estaremos vigilantes y haremos cumplir lo acordado con todos los medios al alcance", ha afirmado.

"I think we did very well, it was a difficult game," said Fernandes.
 "We started good with our ideas but they scored on the counter, I think we were all the time in the game.
 "We scored, we had a lot of chances to score more. It's not enough but we want to win every game. We're not happy but it was a good result.
 "I think the game on the whole was good, after a long break we did very well."
 But Evra took issue with the Portugal international's claim that United were good throughout the contest, before hailing Fernandes' individual performance.
 "I enjoyed that game but I don't agree with him. I think United were better in the second half but he is my man of the match," said Evra.

In light of rising covid-19 cases, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Governor Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday announced that the state would require all residents to wear face masks or coverings in public and in situations deemed high-risk. The reasoning was simple. Apparently, too many people are gambling with their own health and that of others by not putting on face masks.

“I was lucky that I got to meet him (Granda)...he knew of my potential based on my work in his classes,” Valdez said. “I set up meetings with him and I wanted to know what type of projects he was working on.”
 Through the meeting, Granda encouraged Valdez to apply for an internship at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. Valdez said he was skeptical of whether NASA would accept him, and the prospect of having to delay his final semester of undergraduate school to complete the internship, but Granda gave him the push he needed to apply.
 “At the end of the day I was like, you’re totally right, I have to take the risk, I love space exploration and would love to work for NASA,” Valdez said.
 Upon acceptance, Valdez spent four months at NASA’s Johnson Space Center before coming back to finish his bachelor’s degree and apply for his master’s at UC Davis. When he wasn’t accepted into Davis, he said he knew he didn’t want to give up on going there, so he accepted another NASA internship in the interim before applying and being accepted the following spring.
 Once at Davis, he was accepted into the NASA pathways program, which offers interns the chance for full employment. After completing two more internship rotations and graduating in June with his master’s in aerospace engineering, Valdez is slated to start as a full-time aerospace engineer with NASA this fall.
 He said he’s looking forward to continuing his dream with NASA as well as enjoying some time off after years of schooling before starting work full- time.
 “I would like to travel when I can, take some time to do that, definitely enjoy my summer,” Valdez said. “I have some time before the position starts.”
