In questi giorni Pupi Avati sta girando il film Lei mi parla ancora, tratto dall'omonimo libro di Giuseppe Sgarbi, padre di Elisabetta e Vittorio Sgarbi. Il film racconta la storia d'amore tra Giuseppe, detto Nino, e la moglie Caterina, durata 65 anni. Pupi Avati ha scelto Renato Pozzetto per il ruolo di Giuseppe, all'inizio si era parlato di Massimo Boldi ma è bastato un solo incontro con l'attore de Il ragazzo di campagna per convincere Avati. " _Renato è stato una scoperta per me_ ", racconta il regista e spiega il motivo per cui non ha avuto dubbi a sceglierlo: " _Lui ha una sensibilità speciale su questo tema, perché ha perso la moglie dieci anni fa e quando sono andato a trovarlo mi ha raccontato piangendo il momento in cui l'ha perduta. Ho capito che avrebbe fatto benissimo questo ruolo, raccontato questa storia_ "

Wisconsin farmers are on the clock 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.
 When the COVID-19 pandemic closed or reduced hours of operation of a significant number of Wisconsin businesses and restaurants, many farmers and food processors faced much smaller markets for their products.
 With no kids in school to drink cartons of milk, fewer restaurants open to make extra cheesy pizzas or barbecue joints serving pork sandwiches, many farmers have been impacted by contraction of some of their traditional markets.
 The Wisconsin Dairy Recovery and Passion for Pork Programs are two programs that were launched earlier this year to help farmers, while also benefiting food banks and food pantries during this time of need.

The economic downturn from COVID-19 lockdowns has hit many industries in the gut. One industry that doesn't get nearly enough attention is journalism.

We know. We've had to consider the possibility ourselves.

Un danno per l'ambiente ma anche per le attività in mare. guanti e mascherine anti-Covid abbandonati in mare finiscono nelle reti da pesca, un ennesimo rifiuto altamente inquinante che si aggiunge a bottiglie, buste di plastica, bastoncini cotonati per la pulizia delle orecchie e pneumatici. A denunciarlo è Fedagripesca Confcooperative, che ha raccolto le segnalazioni dei pescatori lungo le coste italiane.      "E' impressionante la quantità di mascherine e guanti che porto a terra con le mie reti", racconta all'ANSA Pietro, pescatore del Tirreno. "Va trovata una soluzione - osserva - perché così non possiamo andare avanti".      Difficile fare un bilancio, ma già oggi nei nostri mari, ricorda Fedagripesca, finiscono ogni anno 8 milioni di tonnellate di plastica a cui si aggiungono ora i dispositivi.      Intanto in Thailandia c'è già chi ricava mascherine proprio dal riciclo delle reti da pesca, uno dei rifiuti più diffusi negli oceani. Un'idea che potrebbe prendere piede anche in Italia dove i pescatori già da anni sono impegnati nella raccolta delle plastica in mare e nel recupero degli attrezzi 'fantasma', quelli dispersi accidentalmente.
