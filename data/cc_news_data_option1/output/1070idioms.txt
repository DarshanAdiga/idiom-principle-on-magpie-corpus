According to some estimates, Americans use less than half a roll per week on average. According to others, the average is a little over one. Even at that upper limit, it would take a household of 15 to rip through just one Costco- sized 30-pack of Kirkland Signature two-ply over the course of a 14-day quarantine. For a couple, one pack should last for nearly four months.
 If toilet paper was truly in short supply, some degree of stockpiling would be understandable. COVID-19 can manifest in gastrointestinal distress, in addition to its typical dry cough, fever and risk of pneumonia, and those feeling the symptoms should avoid public places such as the grocery store.
 But despite the photos of empty shelves popping up on social media, is there in fact any risk to the nation’s toilet paper pipeline?
 The short answer: no.
 “It’s not like suddenly all the toilet paper factories in the world are burning down,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies manufacturing supply chains. “They’re still cranking this stuff out.”
 If anything, toilet paper supplies are suffering from being too steady, Shih says. Typically, demand for the product is flat proportional to the population — there is no hot season for toilet paper. That means that factories are designed to run as efficiently as possible around the clock to produce a constant stream of product, with little room for increase or decrease.
 When that constant supply meets a spike in demand, shoppers suddenly run into empty shelves.
 Toilet paper is also distinct from products such as hand sanitizer and coronavirus test kits, where increased use means that there is a genuine risk of shortages. Barring a new craze for mummy costumes, the actual use of toilet paper is unlikely to increase.
 So even if stores are running out of toilet paper today, more rolls will keep showing up like they always have.
 Were toilet paper plants able to increase output, Shih says that wouldn’t necessarily be a good idea.
 “If you’re a supply chain professional, this is called the bullwhip effect,” he said, “an oscillation in supply that moves up the chain.”
 If factories start producing more toilet paper than people could ever actually use in response to a temporary demand surge, then they’ll be left with far too much product on hand down the line.
 Only people who are at higher risk of serious illness from the virus, either from age or other medical conditions, are truly in need of stockpiling enough toilet paper to last for the duration of the outbreak, since going back out to the store for fresh rolls may put their safety at risk (though delivery services should be available as supplies replenish).
 Other countries with severe outbreaks have not suffered total shutdowns of stores or illness rates that disabled the logistics and paper industries. In Italy and parts of China that went into full lockdown, grocery stores remained open, as did factories producing essential products.

Mucho se ha escrito sobre el «PIN» o veto parental, una medida que, ya antes de que la polémica saltara a primer plano de la actualidad nacional, el Gobierno murciano había implementado el pasado mes de agosto a través de una instrucción de la Consejería de Educación, que ordenaba que todas aquellas actividades complementarias que fuesen a ser impartidas por personas ajenas al claustro de los centros que imparten educación infantil y primaria debían ser comunicadas con antelación a los padres o tutores y estos tenían que dar su autorización expresa. Semanas más tarde, en el marco de las negociaciones presupuestarias entre PP, Ciudadanos y Vox, las tres formaciones que dan sostén al Gobierno de Murcia (aunque la formación de extrema derecha no forma parte del mismo), acordaron darle mayor rango normativo.

These kind of imbalanced operations have diverted the focus of industry experts towards exploring and investing in augmented intelligence driven systems and software. As per McKinsey, technology giants like Google and Baidu spent around USD 20-30 billion on AI out of which more than 90 percent was spent on research and development. Companies around the world are struggling to use the concept of augmented intelligence in different areas of operation like, detecting security threats, fixing technological errors, minimizing manufacturing defects, studying consumer behavior to plan future marketing strategies, thus focusing on augmented analytics and mainstreaming financial services. The area of function focused on the most is the use of AI fixing security related issue. This makes the IT industry most involved in the augmented intelligence revolution. Supply chain planning and management is extensively exploring the potential AI has to offer owning to the broad scope of functions that come under this sector. Logistics and shipping is another sector feeling the need for automated augmented intelligence vehicles and systems. As per the U.S transportation sector, truck drivers are allowed to drive for 11 hours at a stretch with a break of 8 hours and the authority positively feels that if autonomous trucks are introduced, the output from this technology will be phenomenal.

 Hudson resident Amy Driscoll followed all the recommended protocols.
   
 Wash your hands. Use hand sanitizer. Don't touch your face.
   
 She still contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that has caused daily life in many places around the world, including Ohio, to come to a screeching halt.
   
 Her first reaction when her test results came back: "Are you kidding me?"
   
 Driscoll became Summit County's second confirmed case of COVID-19 last week, posting about her experience on Facebook -- under her maiden name of Brock -- as a way to encourage others to take the disease seriously.
   
 "I was really sick," she said. "I was really scared there for a little while about how sick I was."
   
 Summit County Public Health could not confirm or deny whether Driscoll was the second confirmed case in the county, identifying the individual only as a person in their 40s.
   
 Driscoll is 48 and provided the Akron Beacon Journal with documentation from her hospitalization. The paperwork indicates she is to remain quarantined and that she is required to notify anyone who treats her that she is under investigation for COVID-19.
   
 As of Monday afternoon, the state reported 50 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ohio, including two in Summit County and three in Stark County.
   
 Driscoll, who is home now under quarantine, said she is starting to feel better, but is still exhausted and dealing with symptoms like fatigue and headaches.
   
 "Just like my body has been through a battle," she said.
   
 The mother of four said she was at work at an insurance company on Wednesday when around 3 p.m. she started to feel tired, like she was starting to get sick.
   
 She went home at the end of the day and took her temperature, which was 99.2 degrees, just above normal. She said she took Motrin and fell asleep.
   
 When she woke up at 3 a.m., she was coughing and her chest hurt.
   
 "It was hard to get a breath in and my chest felt constricted," Driscoll said. "It was like nothing I had ever quite experienced."
   
 She called her cousin, who is a nurse, and then University Hospitals' Ahuja Medical Center. The hospital, she said, initially told her to call the Ohio Department of Health's call center number, but at 3 a.m., there was no answer. Her cousin called Ahuja back and told them Driscoll was on her way.
   
 On arrival, Driscoll said, the hospital immediately put her into isolation. They informed her they needed to run a litany of other tests to rule out diseases like the flu and pneumonia, which she has had before. If all were negative, she could be tested for COVID-19.
   
 By Friday night, after her fever reached around 102 degrees, she had a positive COVID-19 test result.
   
 "I was like, are you sure?" Driscoll said. She received great care, she said, but she was the first patient her doctors had seen with the disease. She asked several questions about how her next few days and weeks might go.
   
 "They shrug their shoulders a little bit and they say, 'We don't really know,'" she said.
   
 They also do not know how she was exposed to the disease. Her ex-husband traveled abroad to Germany recently, and her son had contact with him and then with her, but because no one else is sick, that doesn't appear to be the origin, Driscoll said.
   
 She said she attended the Cavs game the Saturday before with other members of her family before she got sick, just ahead of the NBA suspending its season, and before Gov. Mike DeWine announced schools would close at the end of the day Monday.
   
 Just a week ago, she noted, no one was quite sure how seriously to take the threat of coronavirus.
   
 "In retrospect, we all went, 'Oh maybe we should have made better decisions about that,'" Driscoll said.
   
 The health department had her make a list of anyone she came into contact with in the previous two weeks, and employees at her office at her insurance company, which she did not identify, are all working from home.
   
 Hudson City Schools, where her son attends, sent an email to families Sunday morning, noting the health department had already made calls to any Hudson families who needed to be contacted as a result.
   
 After two days in the hospital, where she was treated with IV fluids, pain medications for the headaches and fever reducers, Driscoll said she was finally starting to feel better and was allowed to go home.
   
 She's spending most of her days on her couch, watching movies with her son and getting up just to get a drink from the kitchen. She's disappointed she won't be able to vote on Tuesday.
   
 When she logged into Facebook following her ordeal, she saw comment after comment from people who didn't believe the disease was that big of a deal.
   
 A friend from high school posted asking if anyone actually know anyone who was sick from COVID-19.
   
 "And I thought -- me," Driscoll said.
   
 Her public post, which was shared thousands of times, encouraged people to take the disease seriously.
   
 "People you love, their lives may depend on it," she said.
