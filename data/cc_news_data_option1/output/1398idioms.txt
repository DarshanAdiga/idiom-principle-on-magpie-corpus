The show appears unwatchably silly on paper: a young film-maker from a US high school attempting to find out who spray painted 27 examples of phallic graffiti on vehicles in the faculty car park. Class clown Dylan Maxwell professes his innocence, but literally everyone thinks it was him. There’s even an eye-witness who claims to have seen the whole thing unfold. Yet, as with all the best mysteries, all is not as it seems…

ALEXANDRIA BAY, N.Y. (WWNY) - Towns will be strapped for cash from the loss of revenue because of the COVID-19 outbreak.With budgets strained, leaders are making adjustments and cutting what they say hurts the least. The town of Alexandria board met Wednesday night over YouTube Live.The board recently laid off two town workers, but did not make any more cuts. The board approved a cost change for using the town garbage transfer station. The town has been struggling with revenue there for years, so to break even, the bags you throw out will cost more. Small bags up to 13 gallons will increase from $2 to $3. Big bags up to 55 gallons will be $6 instead of $3. Town officials say they plan to implement a sticker or town bag program to help solve the deficit.The board also talked about cutting back in personnel or projects at the highway department.“If we have a complete lack of funds, that's when you have to make a hard decision,” board member Michael Fayette said. “You could say like Ron is saying, we've got lots of work, but if you don't have the money to pay for it what are you going to do. I mean seriously what are you going to do?" To be prepared for the blow to sales tax revenue, the board plans to cut the budget by 25 percent, which board members say amounts to about $440,000. They say that would include money towards Bonnie Castle Stables and money for parks and playgrounds. The next meeting will be in two weeks over YouTube Live.Copyright 2020 WWNY.

This series got a bit strange, confusing and overly complicated towards the end, but when it was good, boy was it elementary! Benedict Cumberbatch is perfectly cast as Sherlock, the sociopathic but fiercely clever detective, while Martin Freeman elevates the usually dull role of Watson to actually make him interesting in his own right. Together their chemistry is palpable and it’s the ultimate TV bromance (Ant and Dec are great, but how many criminals have they put behind bars?).

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego maintained player and public health would be the top priorities.
 “There is not a person on the planet who doesn’t want to get back to a time and place marked by familiarity, and there is nothing more familiar than sports, especially the great American pastime of baseball,” she said in a statement. “All of our lives post-COVID-19 will look different. At the city we value flexibility and innovation and are willing to work with the many different sports franchises that call Phoenix home, but only if public health leads every single discussion.”
 Former manager Jim Leyland thinks the game will return to the field at some point this year.
 “I do applaud people that are trying to be creative and come up with different ideas,” he said. “At the end of the day, they’ll come up with some type of a wonderful package. It’s just a matter of when that’s going to be allowed.”
 Starting the season in Arizona presents plenty of complications:
 SOME LIKE IT HOT
 Temperatures average a high of 105 in Phoenix in June and the thermometer has just started to dip at 5 p.m., when presumably many games would start in order to be in prime time on the East Coast. Chase Field’s retractable roof and air conditioning could make it a site of doubleheaders and even tripleheaders.
 EXPANDED ROSTERS
 Given the heat and the compacted schedule, active rosters could be expanded from 26. With teams isolated and the status of minor leagues uncertain, extra players also could be kept in the group.
 MONEY MATTERS
 How much would it cost to put teams and the personnel that travel with them in hotels for double the usual time (no true home games, except for the D-Backs)? There presumably would be savings with not needing charter flights for road trips, but what percentage of that cost was committed in advance? In addition, the absence of ticket revenue would be damaging for many teams. Would player salaries be cut? Who gets to sell stadium signage?
 HOME ADVANTAGE?
 Would the 15 spring training tenant teams in Arizona always get the home clubhouses? Would they have an advantage from playing in the ballparks during the exhibition season?

"They even send us some fun things that they have found to share with the group," Davis said. "A lot of the parents are doing a great job of having them cook with them, getting them outside and physically active. One parent was even having her kiddos learn how to write letters since they couldn't get out and about."
 "I think they are adjusting the best they can right now," Hovis said. "I think it's more the parents are having difficulty adjusting because several parents have different age kids and are trying to work, fix dinner, take care of the family and do their school work with them."
 Hovis said she has not had to talk to many parents, so she has not had to give any pep talks. She said she has heard several parents on social media talking about having to figure out how to manage the newness.

First up, you might be asking, ‘Who is Tim Robinson?’. Fair question. To the uninitiated he’s an American comedian who used to be a regular on US comedy institution Saturday Night Live. His latest project is this barmy sketch show, which is a brilliant find a) because there aren’t enough sketch shows around at the moment and b) because it’s just really funny. Sometimes in this crazy, fast-paced world you don’t want to commit to a drama, or even a half hour comedy – short bursts of hilarity are just the ticket.

While the world wrestles with the coronavirus pandemic, the three biggest U.S.-based sports leagues currently affected by the crisis are trying to figure out if, how and where games can be safely played again this year.
 The NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball have some similar constraints: Public and player health are the most pressing issues and any decisions would have to come with widespread federal, state and local support. But there are also individual challenges for each league, which have unique schedules and playing arrangements that could affect logistics.
 All three have discussed the possibility of essentially quarantining their players in cities for long periods to play games in a safe environment.
 Dr. Patrick Mularoni, who is the medical director of sports medicine at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital, says it’s possible, at least on paper.
 “You’d have to completely isolate the players, staff, coaches, medical staff and likely food-service workers until 14 days. They’d all have to be willing to do that,” Mularoni said. “And the logistics of having that number of people not make a mistake is the difficulty there. But once you do that, if they are all together and working together, once they’re together, you should be fine because essentially what you created is an oasis where people who have proven that they do not have COVID can be.”
 The NBA is looking at countless restart options, but a consistent theme throughout them calls for a training camp of at least two weeks for teams to get back into some sort of basketball shape. It would seem likely that teams would be quarantined at that time. No decision has been made about whether to resume some of the regular season or go right into the playoffs, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said his league won’t decide anything definitively until at least May.
 The idea of having one or two sites for games has been discussed, with Las Vegas and Los Angeles among them. The league has explored several possible sites, for preparation purposes, but has not entered into any concrete deals anyplace.
 The NHL could target a late June or early July resumption of the regular season or beginning of the playoffs. League officials, coaches, general managers and players expect at least a two week re-training camp before resuming play. If the NHL goes directly to playoffs, either 16 or 24 of the 31 teams would likely be involved.

The series tells the story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (aka GLOW), a real-life group formed to promote women’s wrestling on telly. The characters in this series are fictional though. Alison Brie stars as Ruth, a struggling actress who ends up auditioning for the wrestling group to make ends meet. Little does she know that her former best friend Debbie has already been hired – the two got along famously until Ruth stole Debbie’s husband. It seems certain that their bitter feud will either destroy the show or raise it to a whole new level.

The exact stats for the current crime rates in Michigan are not available as of this writing. However, police are reporting that they’re receiving fewer calls and making fewer arrests. It’s possible that Michigan will see significantly lower crime rates in the weeks ahead similar to the dips seen by Chicago and New York City. However, it’s important to remain vigilant as certain domestic and family-related violent crimes may potentially rise the longer people must remain in their house. This is an unprecedented period, and only time will tell how the pandemic may turn the tide when it comes to crime.

It’s just as well, then, that the stalwarts of the series are still on board and on top form. Craig Charles still brings a cheeky charm and the odd burst of real pathos to slobbish survivor Dave Lister, Chris Barrie not only nails his standard self-important schtick as Rimmer but also gets to explore sides of the character we’ve rarely glimpsed before, Robert Llewellyn continues to draw big laughs with Kryten’s unrelentingly earnest nature, the Cat’s vanity and entirely unconcealed loathing of Rimmer is still as funny as when Danny John-Jules first trotted it out in 1988, and the return of Holly actor Norman Lovett’s hysterically deadpan line delivery is also most welcome.

BANGKOK (AP) — Stock markets pushed higher in Europe and Asia on Thursday on hopes that the pandemic was reaching a peak in some economies, while the price of oil rose as major crude-producing countries prepared to discuss output cuts.Benchmarks rose in Frankfurt, London and Hong Kong and ended flat in Tokyo, with investors seemingly reassured by signs that coronavirus deaths and infections may be nearing a plateau in some of the world's hardest-hit areas. The optimism helped to temper concern over increasingly gloomy data on unemployment as companies shutter and shed staff in many parts of the world. The U.S. government was set to report unemployment claims Thursday, with the number expected to shock even after a record nearly 10 million people applied for benefits in the previous two weeks because of business shutdowns from the coronavirus.Germany's DAX advanced 0.4% to 10,372 while the CAC 40 in France shed 0.4% to 4,424. Britain's FTSE 100 picked up 0.7% to 5,719. U.S. shares looked set for gains, with the future for the S&amp;P 500 up 0.4% and that for the Dow industrials gaining 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index was nearly unchanged, ending at 19,345.77, after the central bank governor said the economy faces "extremely high" uncertainty over the likely impact of the pandemic.That uncertainty was heightened by disagreement between leaders over just how quickly and far to extend precautions meant to contain a surge in coronavirus infections. The governor of Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp.'s headquarters and a prefecture not covered by a declared state of emergency for Tokyo and six other areas, has asked that it also be included. The region has reported dozens of police officers falling sick from the coronavirus. Elsewhere in Asia, markets were mostly higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.4% to 24,300.33 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.4% to 2,825.90. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 jumped 3.5% to 5,387.30 and South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.6% to 1,836.21. India's Sensex surged 3.3% to 30,884.46. Recent upward swings in markets have dwarfed declines amid signs that deaths and infections may be nearing a peak or plateau in some of the world's hardest-hit areas.That's led some investors to begin looking to the other side of the economic shutdown that is gripping the world as authorities try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The S&amp;P 500 has jumped nearly 23% in the last two and a half weeks, building on earlier gains driven by massive amounts of aid promised by governments and central banks for the economy and markets."Risk assets continued to rally on the perception that the global economy will open up again quicker than expected," Stephen Innes of AxiCorp said in a commentary. The prospect for progress in talks among oil producers has also driven gains, he noted. "The icing on the cake, ... a 'good' outcome for oil prices from the OPEC+ meeting, would be a global agreement to cut output ... beyond OPEC and Russia, although demand concerns will persist," Innes said.Oil prices have been even more volatile than stocks recently as Russia and Saudi Arabia bicker over production levels as demand withers. Oil producers are set to discuss an output cut on Thursday, and an announcement for production cuts to prop up the price of crude is possible.Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.60 to $26.69 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange early Thursday. It gained $1.46, or 6.2%, to settle at $25.09 a barrel on Wednesday, recovering some of its 9.4% slide from the day before.Brent crude oil, the international standard, rose $1.34 to $34.18 per barrel. It gained 97 cents, or 3%, to $32.84 a barrel in London.In currency trading, the dollar fetched 108.82 Japanese yen, down from 108.84 yen on Wednesday. The euro sold for $1.0863, strengthening from $1.0856. Treasury yields, which have signaled worries about the economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak earlier than the stock market, were relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 0.73%, from 0.76% late Wednesday.Nearly 1.5 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed around the world, with more than 432,000 of them in the United States. More than 88,000 people have died from the virus, while nearly 330,000 have recovered, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

As a result of the virus, police are being constantly equipped with masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer to keep themselves safe, including access to biohazard suits if necessary. Police are using social distancing measures when responding to calls and traffic stops to avoid face to face interactions. These officers want to take every measure to keep themselves as safe as possible. However, over a fifth of the police departments in Detroit have been quarantined, two officers have died, and around 39 officers have tested positive even with these measures in place. As more officers get sick and available protective supplies begin to dwindle, the police's ability to respond to crime gets even tougher.

And Vern Williams, he had a pickup truck, and my parents went and bought a new refrigerator and set it up. And Vern come over that night when the electricity was supposed to come on. We sat there, and it flickered a few times off and on, and then you could hear the refrigerator turn on. And my mom got up and turned out the oil lights. I didn’t have hot and cold running water until I went to Michigan State. Mom would put a tub out in the kitchen on Sunday night; she had hot water on the stove. We took turns going in there taking baths; the little kids got baths first, when the hot water was clean.
