Hello, dear readers! We hope this new year is finding you happy and healthy, and that the expectations of the holiday season didn’t take their toll.

 • In response to a column about an inflammatory condition known as polymyalgia rheumatica, or PMR, several of you wondered if changes to diet may be helpful. This condition causes pain and stiffness in the muscles and joints, most often in the neck and shoulders, but also the hips, thighs and lower back. Treatment includes corticosteroids, such as such as prednisone, and pain meds, such as ibuprofen and aspirin.
 Research shows that lifestyle changes, including a diet to lower inflammation, can also help ease symptoms. One of the goals in this type of eating is to stabilize insulin levels. That translates to a diet low in added sugars and simple carbohydrates and rich in a variety of colorful, nonstarchy vegetables. Steer clear of alcohol, processed foods, fried foods and processed meats. Harness the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids with fish such as mackerel, sardines and salmon, and flax seeds, chia seeds and leafy greens.

WASHINGTON — A Chicago woman has become the second U.S. patient diagnosed with the dangerous new virus from China, health officials announced Friday.
 The woman in her 60s returned from China on Jan. 13 without showing any signs of illness, but three or four days later she called her doctor to report feeling sick.
 The patient is doing well and remains hospitalized "primarily for infection control," said Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner.
 Earlier this week, a man in Washington state became the first U.S. patient, also diagnosed after returning from a trip to the outbreak's epicenter in central China.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expecting more Americans to be diagnosed with the newly discovered virus in coming days, as worldwide the number of confirmed cases has passed 800.
 The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. It is a member of the coronavirus family that's a close cousin to the deadly SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past.
 According to the Iowa Department of Public Health, the CDC today announced that 63 people are being evaluated for possibly having the new virus, but none of those cases are in Iowa. Dubuque County health officials also confirmed that, despite rumors to the contrary, there are no cases in the county.
 Still, "CDC believes that the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly," said CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier.
 And those first two patients did the right thing, recognizing their travel risk and alerting doctors to it, so that health authorities could get them isolated to prevent spread, tested promptly, and start monitoring people who've had close contact with them.
 The incubation period is thought to be two weeks. But it's also a heavy flu season, and some of the symptoms are similar, Messonnier said.
 "We want everyone to err on the side of caution if they have those symptoms and have a travel history," she stressed.
 Illinois health officials did not identify the hospital where the woman is in isolation.
 The Washington state patient was in satisfactory condition Friday in an isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, 30 miles north of Seattle. Nurses who've trained for Ebola patients are providing his care, wearing hoods with plastic face shields and using respirators to breathe filtered air. They are bagging and storing disposable gloves, linens and gowns until the CDC tells them what to do with the patient's medical waste.
 "We have been preparing for this since 2015," said Robin Addison, one of the nurses and co-leader of the hospital's biocontainment team. The hospital is one of about 150 nationwide ready to assess patients with Ebola or other highly contagious diseases, with training money provided by Congress.
 Nationally, over 2,000 returning travelers had been screened at U.S. airports and 63 people in 22 states were being tested, although 11 of them so far have been found free of the virus, the CDC said.
 China has issued massive travel bans in hard-hit sections of that country to try to stem spread of the virus. For now, CDC said it will keep up its screening process at five U.S. airports but will reevaluate its necessity.
 "Right now, our response is very much a work in progress," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., as lawmakers emerged from a briefing with federal health authorities. "There's a lot we're still learning."
 In Chicago, the health commissioner said the newest patient hadn't had close contact with many people since becoming ill or taken public transportation or attended large gatherings.
 "This is all very reassuring as far as infection risk to the general public," Arwady said.
 "There is no need for the general public to change their behavior in any way."

Ann was a member of the Golden Key National Honor Society, the Phi Kappa Honor Society, and also an associate member of the Honors Program at Iowa State. She continued her education at Morningside College over the course of her career.
 Ann and Cory Cox were united in marriage on July 26, 1997, and on March 1, 2005, welcomed their son, Cameron. Ann and Cory divorced in December 2017.
 Ann had been the school’s Talented and Gifted teacher for 19 years, and most recently, had also begun teaching seventh grade math. Her students affectionately called her “MC.”
 Ann had a “get it done” attitude and quickly went to work on anything needing attention. Ann was not afraid to tackle home repair projects, often teaching herself how to do things, such as patch drywall and install flooring. She helped her students realize how to “think outside the box,” helping them with their natural talents and showing them that anything is possible with perseverance.
 Ann’s teaching didn’t stop in the classroom. She escorted many students to Math Bowls, Quiz Bowls, Destination Imagination competitions, and countless other matches of the minds. She guided Destination Imagination teams, who several times advanced to the International Competition.
 Ann is survived by her parents, Harvey and Nancy Hanson of Castana; her son, Cameron; three brothers, Chris (Patty) of Sloan, Steve (Kim) of Hampton, and Ken (Wade Petersen) of Ankeny; and one sister, Julie (Steve) Whitney of Castana; uncles, Brady Hanson and Paul Petersen; aunts, Cathy Hanson and Lois Jensen; as well as nieces, nephews, cousins, co-workers, students, and friends.
 She was preceded in death by her grandparents, Elvin and Hazel Hanson and Fred and Eva Anderson; a cousin, Roger Petersen; aunt, Patsy Petersen; uncle, Heral Jensen; and other extended family.

Rate structures for the two companies are 33 cents a minute, but Uber will charge 70 cents per kilometre while Lyft charges 65 cents, and base and services fees for Uber are $4.50 compared with Lyft's $5.
 Taxi rates can vary in Metro Vancouver, but the base fare is generally $3.25 and $1.88 per kilometre.
 Vancouver quickly issued business licences to Uber and Lyft after the Passenger Transportation Board approved provincial licences Thursday.
 Currently, drivers for both ride-hailing companies must arrange for separate business licences and fees in every municipality across Metro Vancouver, but a framework for a unified ride-hailing business licence is expected by early next month.

“We’ve got so much to celebrate with Cowboy football,” voice of the Cowboys Larry Reece said to begin the pep rally. “We’ve got a couple of All-Americans coming back for one more ride with the Cowboys. Are you fired up? There are a number of preseason rankings that have come out, and they’ve got the Cowboys in the top 15 in every one of them. How about that? Is that something or what?
 “The Cowboys are the only team in the country that returns a 2,500 (yards) or more career receiver and 2,500-yard or more career rusher. We’re the only ones who can say that. You’ve got 10 out of 11 starters back on your Cowboy defense. A defense that held each of our last six opponents to under their scoring average. So, there is a lot to be excited about on the defensive side, as well.”
 While several players either announced they are returning next year or just didn’t even attempt to turn pro when there was a possibility they could do so, the Cowboys received good news since the calendar turned to 2020.
 First, longtime wide receivers coach Kasey Dunn was elevated to the offensive coordinator after Sean Gleeson left for a new job following one year in Stillwater. Dunn has turned the OSU program into one of the best for wide receivers, so his promotion came as positive news to the fanbase.
 Second, wide receiver and Biletnikoff Award finalist Tylan Wallace announced via social media that he would be returning for his senior season. Wallace’s junior campaign was cut short because of a torn ACL, yet he led the Cowboys in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.
 The third and final piece of the puzzle came on the first day of the semester. Running back Chuba Hubbard announced via social media he was returning to Stillwater for his redshirt junior season following a 2019 year where he led all FBS players in rushing yards and tied for third in rushing touchdowns.
 “I felt like everybody was trying to get the scoop,” Hubbard said. “I’d go to the store and somebody would ask me, ‘What are you going to do?’ I’d say, ‘I can’t tell you that.’ It felt good figuring out what I wanted to do. Obviously, it was a long process and a lot of people were anxious about it. Once I made the decision, I was happy with it and I’m going to live with it.”
 Hubbard just finished one of the best years of any OSU running back. He was named the Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of the Year, was a finalist for the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award, was one of three finalists for the Doak Walker Award and finished eighth in the Heisman Trophy Award voting.
 He also became the second Cowboy tailback to surpass 2,000 rushing yards in a single season, finishing behind only the 1988 Heisman winner, Barry Sanders.
 Speculation about his future had been swirling around for weeks, with some reports saying he was leaving while others said he was coming back to OSU. Hubbard made it official last week, and he was greeted by loud applause Tuesday in the student union.
 Hubbard caused arguably the loudest applause when he made one quick statement about why he returned to OSU.
 “We’re bringing a national championship to Stillwater,” Hubbard said.
 Hubbard’s declaration brought smiles to his teammates’ faces. They admitted a lot of work has to be done to a team that finished 8-5 this year. But, with Hubbard’s return, they are excited about the possibility of a great 2020 season.

While the Canadian women have never faced St. Kitts, their captain has already scored 11 times against Jamaica and 16 against Mexico.
 The record sits in the Canadian team background, at least when the captain is around.
 "It might get spoken about behind her back," veteran midfielder Sophie Schmidt said with a giggle.
 "It's going to happen this tournament," she added. "I know she doesn't like talking about it but as a team we're very excited for her to reach that milestone and if we can, we're just going to give Sincy as many opportunities as possible and she'll be clinical as per usual."
 The goal — and the record-breaker that will undoubtedly follow — will be celebrated by many.
 "I will secretly cry in the corner," said former Canadian international goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc, now head of CONCACAF women's football. "Because this woman deserves every single ounce of this, because you know her to be the most humble woman in the world — and she'll try probably not to talk about it."
 Sinclair routinely shies away from the spotlight. The pride she feels in chasing the record is mostly about the Maple Leaf she wears on her chest.
 "It would be pretty cool to see a Canadian on the top of that (list)," she said.
 Pressed on the issue, Sinclair acknowledges she is "just proud to be in this position, proud of the body of work I've had in terms of a career. It's pretty special."
 But Sinclair takes a Zen-like approach to her game.
 "If I score, I score. If I don't, it means someone else is which makes me happy too."
 It's almost 20 years since Sinclair debuted for Canada under coach Even Pellerud in a 4-0 loss to China at the Algarve Cup on March 12, 2000. Two days later she opened her goals account eight minutes into a 2-1 loss to Norway at the same tournament.
 Sinclair remembers it well. Pellerud was a former Norway coach. And she beat Bente Nordby, one of the best goalkeepers in the world at the time.
 "I intercepted a pass and it was a breakaway and then put it far post," Sinclair recalled. "You never forget your first one, right?"
 More followed. Many of the memorable variety. LeBlanc saw Sinclair's star quality from the get-go.
 "She'd first come into camp and we were doing a scrimmage and she'd take a touch, the ball was inside of the six (yard box), took a touch and placed it. And I was like 'Who is this kid?' Because as a goalkeeper, usually people try to just hit it as hard as they can because they're so close and she placed the ball where I was not.
 "It sounds so small and simple but that that's why she became and arguably will be the best goal-scorer in football. Because her poise in front of the net and her ability to put the ball where the goalkeeper is not is why she is who she is. Because she's at home in front (of goal)."
 One of Sinclair's most celebrated strikes came Dec. 19, 2010, against host Brazil in the final of an international tournament.
 After a Canadian takeaway, the ball came forward to Melissa Tancredi who beat a Brazilian and found Sinclair plowing a lone furrow up front. Pulling the defence apart, the two exchanged passes again before Tancredi found Sinclair, positioned a yard or so off the corner of the penalty box.
 Loading up her weaker left foot, Sinclair bent the ball high from distance off the far goalpost into the net past a diving goalkeeper while five Brazilian defenders watched Sinclair's brilliance from inside the box.
 "I think what makes a goal-scorer is the variety of finishes, the variety of tools and expertise and finishing or power ... the subtleties and nuances," said former Canadian international Carmelina Moscato. "And that was something I had never seen from her before. It just made me feel like she was limitless.'"
 Sinclair has made a career of rising to the occasion, scoring on big stages.
 On opening day of the 2011 World Cup, she stunned a crowd of 73,680 when she bent a free kick over a wall and past the goalkeeper in a 2-1 loss to host Germany.
 "For a moment we were able to silence the Berlin Stadium," Sinclair recalled. "It's just a moment I'll never forget."
 Four years later, Sinclair rescued Canada on home soil on Day 1 of the 2015 World Cup. With the pressure of an entire country on her shoulders, she stepped up to the penalty spot in the 92nd minute against China and hammered a penalty in off the goalpost for a 1-0 win in Edmonton.
 Perhaps Sinclair's most famous performance was a never-say-die hat trick against the U.S. in the 2012 Olympic semifinal, which ended in a controversial 4-3 American win after extra time.
 "I felt so blessed to be on her team and to watch just extraordinary happen in one of the greatest stadiums of all time, in the stadium where every single girl who played in that game grew up watching on TV hoping to one day probably go and watch a game in the stands," said LeBlanc.
 "But we were able to be part of arguably one of the best games in women's football history. And watch a woman just soar. That's the game for me I will never ever forget."
 The first goal was classic Sinclair with assists from Marie-Eve Nault and Tancredi. After taking a flick from Tancredi, Sinclair raced towards goal. She controlled the ball with her left foot, took an extra touch to get round a defender and coolly slotted the ball home with her right foot.
 The second goal came from a fine cross from Tancredi. Sinclair got separation from her marker and headed the ball into the corner past American 'keeper Hope Solo.
 The third came off a Schmidt corner, with Sinclair rising high to beat her marker again before heading the ball high into the corner over a defender positioned at the post.

The present day material is where “Altered Limb” shines, though, giving Rin and Doa the opportunity to do a little scouting and ass-kicking of their own as they spy on Habaki, uncover Burando's monstrous experiments, and launch a mission to rescue not only Manji and Usaku, but all of the many men Burando has absconded in the recent weeks. The episode still struggles with some awkward pacing and editing – see the “Odds and Ends” section for more on that – but this is a remarkably consistent episode for a show that hasn't ever been known for stitching together its plotlines with grace. This allows for actual tension to build up in the scenes leading up to the girls' infiltration of Habaki's lair, and it helps the non-too-subtle themes of the episode breathe a little too. When an exasperated Rin exclaims at one point that “This is a woman's fight!”, I was worried that the episode was going to stick with the women _only_ making progress through nagging and subterfuge, but Blade of the Immortal doesn't disappoint, at least not this time.

One welcome but very poorly communicated development in this episode is Hyaku's return. I was waiting for her to help out Doa and Rin with Manji's rescue, but instead we get a tonally out of place scene where she and Giichi get into a violent argument over her recently discovered pregnancy. Within the span of a minute or two Hyaku is trying to abort the baby with a rock, Giichi is pinning her to the ground and slapping her, and the two have a heart-to- heart about whether either of them could raise the baby in the manner it deserves. It isn't even entirely clear if this scene is a flashback or something happening while Rin and Doa are doing their thing, and it isn't mentioned again. It's weird.

Fulton County Schools’ planned South Fulton STEM School soon will have a new name.
 The Fairburn school, which will open in August 2021 and focus on science, technology, engineering and math, will be called Global Impact Academy.
 “I brought this up at my (Jan. 21) community meeting and told them exactly what the new name was and what the committee came to with us,” said District 4 Fulton Board of Education member Linda Bryant, who represents part of south Fulton. “There was no opposition to it. Everybody seemed to have no problems with it.”
 District 6 board member Kimberly Dove, who also represents part of south Fulton, added, “The same thing happened with my community meeting. We had a student there. One of the comments about liking the name is it didn’t name what part of the county it was in and, also, it’s near the airport. The questions were mostly about programming.”
 At its Jan. 23 meeting at the South Learning Center in Union City, the board voted 7-0 to approve the first reading of the school’s new name. It must get a second reading, expected at the board's work session and meeting Feb. 11 and 20, respectively, to become official.
 The district plans to open two STEM schools – Global and a north Fulton one, known as Innovation Academy and located in Alpharetta – at the same time. In November the district broke ground on Global and Innovation. Their principals have already been named and their staff is in the process of being hired.

The celebrated rookie out of Duke, whose maiden regular-season appearance was delayed three months by arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, said watching the final five minutes from the bench out of caution was “very hard.”
 “I’m 19, honestly. In that moment, I’m not thinking about longevity,” Williamson continued. “I’m thinking about winning that game, so it was very tough.”
 LaMarcus Aldridge had 32 points and 14 rebounds, DeMar DeRozan added 20 points, and the San Antonio Spurs withstood Williamson’s late surge for a 121-117 victory over New Orleans on Wednesday night.
 “The crowd got into it. We didn’t let it rattle us,” DeRozan said, adding that Williamson “went on a hell of a run.”
 “It was great that we held our composure, executed when we needed to, and came up with stops when we needed to,” DeRozan added.
 With Spurs coach Gregg Popovich sending double-teams at Williamson, the rookie struggled to find his shot during the first three quarters. When the fourth quarter began, he had just five points, four rebounds, an assist and four turnovers in a little less than 12 minutes.
 But when the 6-foot-6, 285-pound Williamson found himself open for a straight- on 3 with about nine minutes to go, he let it fly and it went down, infusing the stadium with energy. He followed that up with a torrid three-minute stretch in which he laid in an alley-oop lob, put back a missed shot with a reverse layup and hit three more 3s.
 Williamson wasn’t known for shooting 3s when he starred at Duke. He was so often able to dominate inside. But Williamson noted that his long rehabilitation probably helped him refine his outside shot.
 “When you’re not able to move around and do athletic movements for a while, the only thing you can do is just shoot spot-up jumpers, I guess that was the result of that.”
 His teammates loved it.
 “The first one, I was like, ‘All right. Cool,” guard Jrue Holiday said. “Then the second three, I was like, ‘All right, boy, you’ve been practicing.’ And the third one, and from that point on, the energy was crazy.”
 Williamson came into the game knowing his playing time would be limited — even though he started. He had played a total of 18:18 when he was subbed out for good with the Pelicans — who trailed by 12 to start the final period — down 109-108.
 Soon after, DeRozan began San Antonio’s decisive surge with a finger roll and pull-up jumper. Aldridge followed with a tip-in and jumper shortly after.
 New Orleans got as close as 119-117 on Josh Hart’s 3, but Aldridge responded with two free throws and the Spurs did not give up another basket.
 “I was really proud of our guys,” Popovich said. “We took a huge blow. We stayed the course and just played.”
 Brandon Ingram scored 22 for New Orleans but missed 16 of 22 shots, while Lonzo Ball had 14 points and 12 assists.
 Williamson entered the Smoothie King Center wearing a black suit with a blue design and blue basketball sneakers. Written in pink on the black T-shirt he wore under his sport coat was the expression, “Let’s Dance,” which was his message to New Orleans the night the Pelicans drafted him.
 He certainly found his rhythm in the fourth quarter of his first game, raising hopes for what lies ahead in New Orleans’ remaining 37 games.
 “It was everything I dreamed of, except for the losing part,” Williamson said. “Just the energy the crowd brought, the energy the city brought, it was electric and I’m just grateful that they did that. So it was a dream come true to finally get out there, but at the end of the day I did want to win, so we’ve got to look to the next game.”

“That’s the leading rusher right there and I believe he should have won the Heisman, and he definitely should have won the Doak (Walker) award,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Spencer Sanders said. “I’m honored to have him back. He’s taught me a lot, not only following him as a leader, but about being a leader myself.”
 Sanders said he didn’t try to sway Hubbard’s decision either way, but instead told his teammate that he had his back no matter what. However, he did have to keep the news of Hubbard’s return secret for a bit.
 “I was one of the first few people to know,” Sanders said. “I felt like he could trust me, because he told me before, so I felt good about that, too. We’ve built a bond with each other, and it builds really good team chemistry.”
 Sanders is also quite excited to have his leading target back for one more year. Wallace quickly became Sanders’ top target early in the season, when he was adjusting to being a starting quarterback at the college level.
 Their chemistry continued to build throughout the season until Wallace’s injury. Without his leading receiver, Sanders began to find guys like Dillon Stoner and Braydon Johnson until his first season under center ended with a thumb injury.
 On Tuesday, he talked about what it would be like to have Wallace and most of his top targets back next fall.
 “Building chemistry with other receivers when he went down kind of helped me, so that when they do double cover Tylan or Stoner, I’ve got Wolf, I’ve got Braydon Johnson and other targets,” Sanders said.
 “I’m thriving to be better every day. I’ve been watching film about four times a week – about eight hours a week. I’m trying to be the best quarterback I can be for this team, these fans and this university. … I want to go all the way, honestly.”

WASHINGTON -- An audio recording appeared to capture President Donald Trump calling in 2018 for the firing of the then U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a key figure in the series of events that led to his impeachment, ABC News reported on Friday
 The recording features a voice that sounds like Trump's speaking at a small dinner in April 2018 with guests including Lev Parnas, a former associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, ABC reported, citing sources familiar with the recording.
 Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report of the recording.
 If it is authentic, it would bolster Democrats' argument that Trump associates spent nearly a year trying to oust the ambassador, Marie Yovanovich, because they saw her as an obstacle in their efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Trump's political rival Joe Biden.
 Parnas had recounted the conversation in media appearances last week.
 "Get rid of her!" the voice says, according to ABC. "Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it."
 Trump has said he had the right to fire Yovanovich, which he did in May 2019.
 "Every President in our history has had the right to place people who support his agenda and his policies within his Administration," said White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham.
 Parnas attorney Joe Bondy said his client had not released the recording but that he was glad it came to light.
 "When I read the article I was particularly gratified to see that everything Mr. Parnas has been stating about that event was true," Bondy said, referring to the April 30, 2018 dinner. "It is yet another example of Mr. Parnas's version of events being corroborated by evidence in the form of recordings, emails, text messages."
 Parnas, a Florida businessman, has been providing evidence to Democrats now pushing for Trump's ouster at his impeachment trial in the Senate. He played a key role in Giuliani's effort to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine for Trump. He is now under indictment for campaign finance violations in a separate criminal case.

TAUNTON - It wasn't just a happy ending when two boys were pulled to safety Thursday afternoon after falling through ice on the Taunton River.
 "It was a heroic ending," Taunton Superintendent John Cabral said during a press conference held at Taunton Police headquarters.
 Cabral was referring specifically to three local good Samaritans, including two school department employees, who stopped to help pull the two 14-year-olds to shore after they had ventured onto the ice.
 "It could have had a tragic ending, but instead it was a happy ending," said Mayor Shaunna O'Connell.
 "I'm proud of my community and our first-responders," she added.
 Taunton police spokesman Lt. Eric Nichols said the episode began at around 2 p.m. with a group of kids hanging out on the Edward McCarthy Memorial Bridge near the intersection of County, Summer and Ingell streets.
 One of them, he said, apparently wanted to check the ice to see if it was solid enough for ice skating.
 With four kids watching from above, the two boys tested their luck and ended up falling through the ice.
 Nichols credits Taunton resident Kevin Boss, 54, for pulling over and grabbing a rope from his vehicle.
 At nearly the same time, he said, Taunton High School assistant storekeeper Nick DaCosta and community facilitator Lynne Farina noticed the commotion and pulled their own vehicles over to help.
 Shortly thereafter four Taunton police officers arrived on scene. All seven adults were able to use the rope to haul the boys, one at a time, to shore.
 Nichols emphasized that the Taunton River is a tidal river with currents that sometimes run fast.
 "It could have been much worse," he said.
 Taunton Police Dive Commander Sgt. Matthew McCaffrey says the center portion of the river near the bridge is around 12 feet deep.
 McCaffrey says he was at the police station when the call for help came in. He says the rescue was handled so quickly that it wasn't necessary for the dive team to assist.
 A press release issued on behalf of the police and fire departments says one boy was trying to swim to shore while the other was struggling to stay afloat when Boss pulled over.
 The only adults involved in the rescue who showed up for Thursday night's press conference were DaCosta and Patrolman Daniel Williams.
 Williams said it's his understanding that a school crossing guard made the 911 call.
 DaCosta said the second boy in the water appeared to be "exhausted."
 "He was really struggling," DaCosta said.
 The boys, he said, "looked petrified" and somewhat disoriented when they were brought ashore.
 The entire episode, he said, lasted five or six minutes but felt much longer.
 Nichols said the police and fire departments average one or two incidents per year of a person or persons falling through ice. But he said it usually happens on a pond where the water is fairly shallow.
 Cabral said elementary students in the city's public school system are taught water safety and are warned not to walk onto icy bodies of water, especially without adult supervision.
 Nichols said the two teens who fell through the ice Thursday were transported by Brewster Ambulance Service to Morton Hospital where they were evaluated and released.
 Cabral said both are eighth-graders at Taunton High School.

During our three days visiting, the boys had something going on here, there, and everywhere. Brad was out-of-town for his new job, so it worked out well that we were around to help get Brandon to school, confirmation, and everywhere he needed to be. Tyler has a school permit now, which makes me nervous. The quiet little town of Grimes has grown so much since the kids moved there when Tyler was six weeks old.
 Grimes has grown by leaps and bounds. What was farm ground five years ago is now the home of Walmart, a huge new Menards, new restaurants, two new schools, new churches, and a bank and mini mart on every corner. Two new grocery stores are being built within blocks of each other. Every time we make a trip to visit, we cannot believe how it continues to grow with new housing. It is your typical small community that is close enough to the city, so it is in a location that will continue to grow.
 When Charlie and I got back to Decatur, we said the same thing we always say to each other, “We will take our small, quiet little community over the city any day.”

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said Friday that 34 U.S. troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries suffered in this month's Iranian missile strike on an Iraqi air base, and that half of the troops have returned to their military duties.
 Seventeen of the 34 are still under medical observation, according to Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman.
 President Donald Trump had initially said he was told that no troops had been injured in the Jan. 8 strike. The military said symptoms were not immediately reported after the strike and in some cases became known days later.
 After the first reports that some soldiers had been hurt, Trump referred to them as "headaches" and said the cases were not as serious as injuries involving the loss of limbs.
 Hoffman's disclosure that 34 had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, or TBI, was the first update on the number injured in Iran's missile attack on Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq since the Pentagon said on Jan. 17 that 11 service members had been flown out of Iraq with concussion-like symptoms.
 Hoffman said that of the 34 with TBI, 18 were evacuated from Iraq to U.S. medical facilities in Germany and Kuwait, and 16 stayed in Iraq. Seventeen of the 18 evacuees were sent to Germany, and nine remain there; the other eight have been transported to the United States for continued observation or treatment.
 The one American sent to Kuwait has since returned to duty. All 16 of those who were diagnosed with TBI and remained in Iraq have since returned to duty, Hoffman said.
 No one was killed in the attack on Ain al-Asad. The strike was launched in retaliation for a U.S. drone missile strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, the most powerful military general in Iran, on Jan. 3 at Baghdad International Airport.

First up, there's a story by Akira Fukaya and Takashi Kisaki about Luke single-handedly smashing a Star Destroyer – and then saving the life of the only person to escape alive, a kid who's fallen for Emperor Palpatine's sense of what “order” is. Luke puts splints on his broken legs and effectively nurses him back to health on the desert planet they've landed on, right before the Destroyer's engines melt down and turn the sand into an ocean of glass. The story is an examination of the philosophical differences between the Empire and the Jedi, mostly divorced from the emotionally-constipated concepts that the prequels introduced about the Jedi philosophy. Luke, here, introduces instead the idea that “we are all Luke Skywalker” - we're all capable of confidence and heroism, and the individual means little in the face of fascism if you're not trying to help people and do the right thing - something that resonates very directly. Abstractly, he convinces the kid he saved that the Empire is something to be fought against with all your might. So the kid does – and it's pretty great.

Ahhh. That makes more sense. The old “Two minutes! That counts! You watched it! No take backs!” It’s like one step and a little hop away from counting it as a view when you stop scrolling down the home page for a minute and the trailer starts playing. But whatever, I guess. Good for them. They had to gas up the submersible and go all the way down to that vault to get the numbers, you know? Someone could have gotten hurt.

The video also comes just days before the Grammys where Burna Boy earned a nomination in the Best World Album category for _African Giant_. The nomination made him the ninth Nigerian to earn one, joining a very talented list that includes Wizkid, Timaya, Femi Kuti and more. A win would make him just the second Nigerian to take home a Grammy award, following Sikiru Adepoju's 2009 win for his part on the _Global Drum Project_. In addition to the extremely successful album, the Nigerian-born act also landed a spot on Beyonce's _The Lion King: The Gift_ album and saw "Ye," a single from his 2018 album _Outside_ take the outright position as his most successful song to date.
