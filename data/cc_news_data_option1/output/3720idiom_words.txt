Hitting out at the Congress, the Agriculture Minister said Congress government intended to take steps similar to those in the bill but lacked courage.   He referred to a speech by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and said it mentioned that "time has come to make the country a common market for agricultural produce".   He said Congress manifesto stated that the party will amend the Agriculture Produce Markets Act so that restrictions on exports and interstate trade are removed.   He said the budget of Agriculture Ministry has seen a steep rise under Modi government.   "PM KISAN scheme was started and Rs 92,000 crores have been deposited in bank accounts of farmers," he said.   The Lok Sabha had earlier passed a bill to amend the Essential Commodities Act.   Opposing the bills, Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said that three ordinances are "a toxic triangle".   He said Harsimrat Kaur, who resigned from the union cabinet over the bills, "has displayed guts by opposing this draconian legislation". (ANI)
