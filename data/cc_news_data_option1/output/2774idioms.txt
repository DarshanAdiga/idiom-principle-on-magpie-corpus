Seriously, what are the many clips that you have hidden in your safe, Big Hit Entertainment? BTS' managing agency just dropped a new video featuring Jungkook, J-Hope and Jimin from the sets of the Boy With Luv filming. During the takes, Hobi, Kookie and Mochi are seen discussing such bizarre yet relatable things under the sun. For example, JK opened up about how he doesn't like it when someone touches his neck with cold hands. The singer placed his cold hands on J-Hope and Jimin's neck and was surprised by how unaffected they felt.

Charges filed against U.S. Congressman Steve Watkins Tuesday evening by Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay took center stage during the first and only 2nd District Congressional debate.
   
 Watkins maintained his innocence regarding the charges and called them hyperpolitical and very suspicious. Kagay announced the charges shortly before the debate took place at 6:30 p.m. on KSNT.
   
 "I haven't done anything wrong," Watkins said. "As soon as I realized that I had put my mailing address instead of my physical address, we fixed it. This is very suspicious, seems highly political (and) we've cooperated with the district attorney completely."
   
 Watkins has been charged with three felonies including voting without being qualified, unlawful advance voting and interference with law enforcement involving false information. He also faces a misdemeanor charge of failing to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of a change of address.
   
 The charges are linked to the November 2019 election.
   
 Watkins said he hasn't seen the charges, but looks forward to clearing his name.
   
 Jake LaTurner, who is one of three Republican candidates running for the second district seat, said the newly announced charges make it clear the race is now between Dennis Taylor and himself.
   
 "Three weeks from now, republican voters across the second congressional district are going to have to pick the very best candidate to go against the mayor of Topeka Michelle De La Isla," LaTurner said. "She is well-funded, she is a candidate supported by Nancy Pelosi and we need to put our best foot forward. Clearly, our current congressman with three felony charges and a misdemeanor charge is not the person to do that."
   
 LaTurner called for Watkins to take responsibility for his actions, "own up to it and deal with the legal issues heading his way."
   
 The 30-minute debate, which was moderated by political scientist Bob Beatty, covered several topics including border security, the COVID-19 pandemic and issues related to racial tensions and law enforcement.
   
 Beatty asked candidates how they think a surge in COVID-19 cases nationwide should be handled and if they agree with Kansas Senator Jerry Moran who recently said the country was not well-prepared and flat-flooted.
   
 Watkins praised President Donald Trump on his efforts to curtail the coronavirus and said he has taken decisive actions.
   
 "We've never had a spike that exceeded our medical capabilities in any particular geography," Watkins said. "It's gonna be tough. Now is a horrible time for partisanship. We need to stick together and see this through."
   
 Taylor agreed with Moran's statement saying that the country hasn't done what is needed since learning about the seriousness of COVID-19.
   
 "What happens in Florida and Texas and Arizona I am afraid is coming here unless we do testing," Taylor said. "We should be doing 20 million tests a day. We are doing about 650,000 on average."
   
 When asked whether or not everyone should be required to wear masks given the rise in new COVID-19 cases, Watkins voiced his disapproval for statewide mask mandates.
   
 "I wear a mask to slow the spread, I wear a mask often," Watkins said. "When I'm flying I wear a mask. That's my choice and it's (an) individual's choice to balance that with the risk."
   
 The debate topic turned toward race relations and policing at the end as Beatty asked the candidates if major police reform is needed in the United States.
   
 "The tragic shooting of George Floyd was a tragedy and the violent response to it has been a tragedy," LaTurner said. "There is a bad apple or two in every single profession under the sun including the police and where those bad apples are found we need to take care of it swiftly. But we cannot allow a bad apple or two to define an entire profession."
   
 Watkins said he has been in communication with law enforcement officials and talked with them about important issues including qualified immunity, no-knock warrants, cameras, collective bargaining and funding.
   
 "We've got a political party that wants to decrease the funding of police as crime is on the rise in our big cities," Watkins said. "So it's time to come together and realize that 99.9 percent of the law enforcement professionals are fantastic individuals. I support them completely and when it comes to African Americans, I ask that they look at what Donald Trump has delivered -- the lowest unemployment rates, opportunity zones, criminal justice reform and home ownership's on the rise. Results matter, tag lines don't."
   
 Taylor, who noted he has police officers and people of color within his family, said he feels the country is on the cusp of needing to decide whether or not law enforcement is being asked to take on tasks that are beyond their expertise.
   
 "We need to decide that as a community and as a country," Taylor said. "We need to be looking at this and this is the time to be checking out whether we really want chokeholds, whether we really want qualified immunity."

The latest killings of African-Americans by law enforcement have not only anguished our country but locked its attention on police brutality directed at communities of color. As Americans have tried to come to terms with our history of racism, we condemn its presence in our profession and call for media outlets to diversify their staffs from the top down.
   
 We also note that journalists, including those of color, have been victims of police misconduct in recent days, and we are disturbed at the large number of attacks perpetrated on all those attempting to uphold a free press in the service of democracy.
   
 According to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, between May 26 and June 10, there were 86 physical attacks on journalists in the United States, 54 by police. More than 50 journalists were arrested, and there were scores of incidents in which reporters said they were hit with tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets. The numbers are so high that it defies logic to consider them isolated moments. They occurred in an environment that either is indifferent to, or condones, illegal intimidation and violence against the press.
   
 As the Committee to Protect Journalists has noted, the journalists at these protests represent the interests of the same public that government also serves. Additionally, the press acts as a check both on government and on rogue behavior among private citizens, a check that is badly needed at this time and helps all people. We are especially aware of the challenges faced by journalists of color. Their jobs ask them to remain dispassionate in the face of attacks that are all-too personal to themselves and their loved ones.
   
 We are journalism professors funded through the Knight Foundation who teach and mentor at public and private universities across the United States. We want a nation where the next generation of journalists, the students we are now training, can do their jobs in a culture of respect for the First Amendment. We call on governors, mayors, state lawmakers, city councils, prosecutors, police chiefs and police union officials, to hold the perpetrators of all attacks against journalists to account, and to ensure such attacks stop immediately.
   
 We also ask colleagues at journalism programs across America to join us in these demands, and in encouraging professional media outlets, and the students we teach, to more thoroughly investigate the structural racism that permeates our society.

On Monday, the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) made the decision to move the majority of their fall sports to the spring semester based on the recommendation of their board of regents.
   
 You can view the updated plan of action here.
   
 The Board met for less than an hour on Monday, passing the resolution to move sports to the spring, in hopes of being able to get them played.
   
 "Arizona schools were not going to participate in the fall," Brian Beck, the NJCAA vice president for eligibility and compliance, said. "That played a large decision into moving sports into the spring semester."
   
 Arizona's Region held an automatic national tournament qualifier for many sports and the restructuring without those schools would have been immense.
   
 Minnesota also said the same thing about fall sports. However, they do supply nine of the 54 football teams who play at the NJCAA level. This is an opportunity for those schools to re-evaluate their position and maybe participate in the spring.
   
 On Friday, July 10 the California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) made their decision to move sports to the spring athletic semester, giving the NJCAA a pathway to what it would look like if the NJCAA chose to do the same.
   
 "We must adjust accordingly to support and sustain NJCAA programs," NJCAA president and CEO Christopher Parker said in an official statement. "The association as a whole is collectively working to provide the best opportunities to be successful on and off the field for our student-athletes."
   
 Only cross country and half marathon running will remain a one-semester fall sports according to the NJCAA. Those schools will be limited to a maximum of 10 competition dates for both sports.
   
 For football, the move is more than six months into the future. Instead of a Aug. 1 starting date for teams, they will now begin on March 1.
   
 Teams will be permitted a 60-day practice window. Teams can have a maximum of three scrimmage dates, limiting to one opponent in each scrimmage.
   
 One coach spoke off the record when talking about the scrimmages, saying "why would I scrimmage another team if it's not safe enough to play actual games?"
   
 A maximum of eight games will be permitted in football and the National Championship will be held in Pittsburg, Kansas on June 3.
   
 The location is subject to change but those at the NJCAA anticipate the location to stay the same.
   
 Bowl games are on the fence for this season. While there are no specific dates set for those, it could be collateral damage as they may find themselves unplayable this season.
   
 One thing to note is eligibility if the NCAA does choose to play in the fall. A player cannot play in the fall with an NCAA team and participate with the NJCAA in the spring.
   
 Volleyball is another major fall sport that will transition into a spring sport for the 2020-21 season.
   
 Court Volleyball will be limited to only 21 competitions and their national championship will be held April 15-17. Matches will begin on Jan. 29, with regional and district tournaments beginning on April 3.
   
 All sports will be given a fall practice season from September 5 through November 15. This window is for 60-consecutive calendar days of practice.
   
 Basketball will begin its season on Jan. 22 and will be limited to 22 regular season games.
   
 Many of the spring sports remain unchanged as most changes were for the fall sports.
   
 The regular season will end on April 10 and the national championship tournaments will begin on April 19 at their respective venues, Hutchinson for the men's and Lubbock, Texas for the women's.
   
 "We want a season this spring," Parker said. "We have to take into perspective of everything that's going on."
   
 Moving fall sports to the spring could be a game-changer for those December qualifiers. Instead of losing a year of eligibility by playing in the fall, they could transfer in December, retaining an extra year of eligibility.
   
 Rosters may appear to be different as those athletes who leave at mid-year could drastically change how a team looks when they take the field in March.
   
 The NJCAA pointed out those competing in fall sports in the spring and then turning around in the fall would count for two seasons of play, not one, as they are different academic calendar years.
   
 In Kansas, a seven-game schedule is most likely as the eight-team league already schedules out the seven-game schedule each season, with the Iowa Schools being the "non-conference" opponents. By this proposal, the KJCCC schools would not play the Iowa schools and would only play the conference opponents.
   
 The KJCCC had already made a quiet move in their conference, moving Week 1's games to the end of the season.
   
 "This is as close to perfection as given our understanding of being adapt and moving into this direction," Parker said.

With the COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of subsiding, it may not be realistic for universities to re-open this fall in any but the most guarded way, if at all. However, once the pandemic does subside, college students will be anxious to get back on campus.
   
 How things do change. Ten years ago, trendspotters pronounced the death of the brick-and-mortar campus. Online classes were the future, they said. We now have nearly two decades of experience delivering online instruction. Here are a few of the biggest lessons.
   
 First, students who can take their classes face to face prefer to do so. A December 2019 EDUCAUSE poll found that 70% of students prefer their classes face-to-face. Students reported a great deal of anxiety about this spring's online migration, and some had difficulty completing their semesters in this format.
   
 So-called "traditional" college students, who attend college shortly after high school, are particularly adamant in their preference for on-campus instruction. They may be digital natives, but they still crave in-person interaction with their peers and professors. Even some older, "nontraditional" students prefer their courses on campus.
   
 Some students may add one online class per semester to their schedules for flexibility, but they are still clamoring for a return to campus after the pandemic subsides.
   
 Second, MOOCs found their niches -- and they will not be replacing face-to- face classes. A decade ago, Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) were the fad. These large, online courses are often taught by professors at such big-name universities as Yale.
   
 They are accessible through for-profit online portals like Coursera. Generally, viewers may take the courses for free unless they want a certificate of completion, in which case they take exams and pay tuition. Observers thought these would replace traditional instruction.
   
 Instead, MOOCs found two narrower niches: those simply curious to learn new things without earning a degree and those seeking profession-specific credentials in a flexible, online format.
   
 Some MOOCs deserve a second look, such as a very popular Science of Well Being course taught by Yale Professor Laurie Santos, plus several new classes for those seeking to become more scientifically literate in the age of COVID. However, MOOCs are not generally a threat to the traditional college curriculum.
   
 Third, most students seeking online degree programs choose state or nonprofit private universities located within a 50-mile radius of their homes. While for-profit, all-online programs have found their niche, most students seek their online degrees from a traditional university that also offers on-campus programs. Online, professionally oriented master's degrees and professional certificates are particularly popular.
   
 State universities often offer better instruction and lower costs than our for-profit competition, and many of these classes are taught or at least supervised by the same full-time, on-campus faculty who also teach face-to- face classes.
   
 Online college has matured and found its proper role in the curriculum, and that role is not to displace most on-campus instruction. Expect students to demand that their campuses re-open once this pandemic subsides.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - An oil tanker sought by the U.S. over allegedly trying to circumvent sanctions on Iran was hijacked on July 5 off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, a seafarers organization said Wednesday.
 Satellite photos showed the vessel in Iranian waters on Tuesday and two of its sailors remained in the Iranian capital.
 It wasn't immediately clear what happened aboard the MT Gulf Sky, though its reported hijacking comes after months of tensions between Iran and the U.S.
 David Hammond, the CEO of the United Kingdom-based group Human Rights at Sea, said he took a witness statement from the captain of the MT Gulf Sky confirming the ship had been hijacked.
 Hammond said that 26 of the Indian sailors on board had made it back to India, while two remained in Tehran, without elaborating.

Skygazers across the Northern Hemisphere are being treated to stunning views of comet NEOWISE as it streaks past Earth. Amateur astrophotographer Javier Manteca got a bonus: the International Space Station and the comet are both seen transiting Madrid in this photo captured 11 July.
 Taken at dawn, the picture is a composition of 17 stacked images exposed every 2.5 seconds to form the skyline.
 Comet C/2020 F3 NEOWISE is named after NASA’s Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission that discovered it in March 2020. The comet completed its perihelion, or closest pass of the Sun, on 3 July and is headed back out of our Solar System, not to return for another 6800 years.
 Comets are the icy remnants from the formation of the planets 4.6 billion years ago, prompting scientists to think of them as cosmic time capsules. Comets have distinctive tails caused by dust grains being swept away from the comet’s nucleus.
 The comet's flyby of Earth is a rare opportunity to observe and collect data on these cosmic time capsules. Many spacecraft have observed the comet, including the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory as well as astronauts on board the International Space Station.
 ESA’s comet chaser Rosetta trailed comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko for two years before landing the Philae probe on its surface. The mission amassed a wealth of data that will be studied for years to come.
 As comet NEOWISE zooms past Earth at a comfortable (and safe) distance of 103 million kilometres, stargazers can catch more views of the comet through July. Consult Earth and Sky or Astronomy Now for times and positions.

AMD's new obsession for marine wildlife might be a real thing. The chipmaker has named another forthcoming Radeon graphics card after a fish. On this occasion, AMD added initial support for Navy Flounder in the Linux display driver (via @Komachi)
 A couple of months ago, a rumor arose that AMD had caught on to users poking around its drivers to find clues of new product releases. There were whisperings that AMD started to use alternate codenames to hide its graphics cards from hardware snoopers. Sienna Cichlid, which is presumed to be Navi 21, was the first example to jumped out of the water last month. And now, AMD is seemingly using the Navy Flounder codename to hide the Navi 22 silicon.
 The Linux patch doesn't really provide much information to speculate on the finer details of the Navi 22 silicon. The description reads that "This patch set adds initial support for Navy Flounder GPUs." If we read between the lines, the statement implies that AMD might release multiple graphics cards that will be based on the Navi 22 die.
 Similar to Sienna Cichlid, Navy Flounder could find itself with the implementation of the Video Core Next (VCN) 3.0 and Display Core Next (DCN) 3.0 engines. This bit of information at least suggests that Navy Flounder is a RDNA 2 graphics card. As you would recall, current Navi graphics cards are on VCN 2.0 and DCN 2.0.
 Navy Flounder's appearance could only mean one thing. In the same vein as Sienna Cichild, AMD may intend to slip support Navy Flounder support in the next Linux 5.9 merge window. The merge is expected to take place in August, meaning the final release might be here in October. The current prediction for a Big Navi launch is in September, which opens the floodgates to a Sienna Cichlid and/or Navy Flounder announcement.
