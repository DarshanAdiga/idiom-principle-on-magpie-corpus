Don't get me wrong Federalism can work, The USA is a good example of that, but it was built on Federalism, and has always had as its head a democratic President, (or at least has had since the country was sliced up into the states), Spain has in living memory come out of a dictatorship, and federalism here seems to mean lots of little dictators all over the country.

“It’s a different world out there,” Bowness, 65, said. “I’m going to have to adjust to it, there is no question. I just want to make sure I’m cautious, which we’ve been since this virus started, and I will continue to do that. My health — hey, I’m a grandfather now, my first grandkid.

United fans also want to see Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic drop to the bench after they showed signs of fatigue during the game against Southampton. Scott McTominay and Fred are given the nod to partner Bruno Fernandes in midfield (our graphic below, which shows the most popular starting XI selected by United fans, has Fernandes down as the holding midfielder, which we can only put down to a technical malfunction!).
 Solskjaer could also be forced to change his defence with Brandon Williams and Luke Shaw both injury doubts. Shaw suffered an ankle injury in the second half of Monday's match and his replacement Williams was also forced off the field following a nasty collision with Kyle Walker-Peters.
 Supporters believe Diogo Dalot should start at left-back in what would be his first Premier League appearance since October. The Portuguese has not been included in any of United's last nine match day squads but MEN Sport understand he is ready to make his return if Shaw and Williams fail to win their race for fitness.

“We’ve got a lot of young players coming in, which is good, but watching the game against Liverpool it was survival football, let’s be honest. There is a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, but the finances, that squad probably needs £100m or £150m spent on it.”

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) already declared a few weeks ago that the use of a service like Clearview AI by the police authorities in the European Union might, in the current state, not be compatible with the European data protection regime. But much more fundamentally, we are dealing here with a company that built its entire activity on the illegal exploitation of personal data and while it should be easy for everyone to protect their privacy on a daily basis, this has become clearly impossible when dealing with companies like Clearview AI."
