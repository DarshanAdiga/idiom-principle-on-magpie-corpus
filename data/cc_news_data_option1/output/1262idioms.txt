KINGSTON - With senior Chase Perkins reaching the All-State tournament, the Silver Lake wrestling team enjoyed its finest season in school history. The Lakers finished 17-10 in dual meet competition, and Perkins was one of three wrestlers selected to the Patriot League All-Star team.
 "This is the best record the team had dual meet-wise since the high school split into Pembroke and Silver Lake," head coach Wayne Reissfelder said.
 Perkins, competing at 160 pounds, advanced to the All-States by finishing fourth in both the Division 2 South Sectionals and the Div. 2 state meet. He had 34 wins, including one of the team's biggest of the season, pulling an upset in a match against Whitman-Hanson that was the difference in a 42-40 victory.
 "He was quite a surprise for us," Reissfelder said. "We knew he had potential, and he really put in the work in the weight room and the wrestling room."
 Junior Kyle Cipullo won 30 matches and also earned a spot on the league all- stars after advancing to the sectional finals at 220 pounds.
 "We expected him to be one of the better wrestlers on the South Shore," Reissfelder said. "In the sectionals, he ran into a kid from Plymouth North (AJ Dias) who ended up second in the states. But he was a big part of why we were 17-10."
 Junior Scott Snell, 18-8 competing mostly at 106, was also honored, even though he was unable to compete in the postseason due to a broken nose.
 "Even with that, and even though all-stars are often determined by postseason success, the coaches put him in because they were well aware of his body of work over the season," Reissfelder said.
 The Lakers also received contributions from a number of other wrestlers. Senior William Barkowski was undefeated in the dual meet season at 152 pounds, went 19-4 overall and finished fourth at the sectionals. Senior Michael Voci, with 23 wins wrestling at 195, also took fourth at sectionals, as did junior Cam Turner, who had 21 wins at 170.
 Seniors Pat Ganley, who collected 20 wins at 126, and Will Hesketh, who split time between 220 and heavyweight, provided additional depth.
 Junior Geoff Cook played an instrumental role, wrestling at 182, nearly 20 pounds above his weight, which allowed the Lakers to fill out their lineup.
 Freshman Sydney Diauto became the first Silver Lake girl to wrestle in the state tournament, competing at 106. She went 2-2 in the girls division.

“There are two pending cases, and there was one emergency evacuation from the ship overnight,” McDonald said during the county’s regular coronavirus news conference Monday afternoon.
 He said the Wonder, which arrived in San Diego reporting that none of its passengers or crew was exhibiting any COVID symptoms, has subsequently seen significant illness develop after arrival.
 “There was one passenger that was known to be positive who is currently hospitalized and there is one crew member that is known to be positive that is currently hospitalized,” McDonald said.
 The crew member, he added, remained on board for some time but eventually had to be sent ashore for treatment, but not before having close contact with six other crew members who are all still quarantined on the Wonder. The passenger went to their San Diego home for a 14-day self quarantine. They had close contact with “less than five” family members.
 McDonald was asked why the public health department is allowing the remaining eclipse passengers to disembark in San Diego given the positive cases associated with the Wonder.
 McDonald said there is “really no more of a risk to the general public than the fact that there is community transmission (of COVID), and there may be individuals in the public that have asymptomatic, incubating, COVID-19.
 San Diego has turned out to be quite a port in the COVID storm.
 The Eclipse will leave San Diego on Tuesday, March 31 around 5 p.m. to go to Acapulco where approximately 200 passengers will disembark on April 4. These passengers do not possess appropriate documents for entry into the U.S. The Eclipse is scheduled to return to San Diego’s outer anchorage on April 7 with no passengers, joining what has become a sort of ghost fleet of massive but mostly empty cruise liners that have stuck around in the area.

(AP) - The NCAA will permit Division I spring-sport athletes — such as baseball, softball and lacrosse players — who had their seasons shortened by the coronavirus pandemic to have an additional year of eligibility.The NCAA Division I Council voted Monday to give spring-sport athletes regardless of their year in school a way to get back the season they lost, but it did not guarantee financial aid to the current crop of seniors if they return to play next year.Winter sports, such as basketball and hockey, were not included in the decision because many athletes in those sports had completed all or most of their regular seasons, the council decided.The council is made up of college sports administrators representing all 32 D-I conferences, plus two members of the student-athlete advisory committee. Voting is weighted to give the Power Five conferences more say. Chairwoman Grace Calhoun, who is Penn's athletic director, declined to reveal the final vote.“At the end we really did coalesce around all of the decisions that we made today,” Calhoun said. “They were strongly supported.”How much scholarship money will be made available to each athlete whose college career would have ended this spring will be determined by the athlete's school. The amount could range from nothing to as much the athlete received had been receiving.The added scholarships could cost a school hundreds of thousands of dollars more than it would usually spend on spring-sport athletes. The extra expenses come at a time when athletic departments could be facing cutbacks. The pandemic forced the cancellation of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, which cut the association's distribution to members by $375 million this year.“We had long discussions around the fact that this does not avoid substantially difficult circumstances, but what we felt was important was to localize that decision- making and to ensure that we were as permissive as possible," Calhoun said. “At the end of the day, each institution is going to have to figure out what it can do.”Schools will be able to use the NCAA’s Student Assistance Fund to pay for scholarships for students who take advantage of the additional eligibility in 2020-21.Roster and scholarship limits for teams will be adjusted next season to fit returning seniors and incoming freshman.Katie Hoeg, an All-American lacrosse player from North Carolina, said she has a teaching and coaching job lined up after she graduates this spring, but now plans to return for another season as a graduate student.“I'm choosing my passion," she said. "I can't imagine ending my lacrosse career the way this season is going. I was pretty hopeful this would be a possibility. I'm really excited this decision has been made.”Nebraska-Omaha softball player Hailey Bartz was planning to graduate in December and move on from school. Now she's not so sure.“I've been speaking with my family about it and trying to figure out pros and cons. Do I want to take advantage of that year? Do I not?" Bartz said. "Some of my teammates have their schooling set up, full-time jobs. You have your life planned out and then this kind of pushes everything back another year. At the same time it's really hard to pass up because it's a game of love.”NCAA Division I rules allow athletes to have four seasons of competition in a five-year period. Schools will be allowed to apply for waivers to restore one of those seasons for any athlete who competed while eligible in the spring season shortened by COVID-19 in 2020. After the 2021 spring season, scholarship and roster limits will apply to athletes granted the waiver.“This has a four- or five-year effect depending on how you want to count it,” said Marquette athletic director Bill Scholl, whose school fields track, lacrosse, tennis and golf teams in the spring. “So the roster management piece is just something our coaches, we’re going to have to figure out and work our way through.’’Calhoun said the council did not consider the possibility of the fall sports season, including football, being interrupted. Football generates billions of dollars, especially for Power Five conferences. Losing that would be potentially devastating to schools that play major college football.“There was an acknowledgment that we don't know the future and if other seasons are canceled other things happen in the future we'll have to take that up with the individual merits of the case at time,” Calhoun said.___AP sports writers Eric Olson in Omaha, Nebraska, and Steve Megargee in Milwaukee contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

SELF isolation and the Super Rugby season shutdown has been the latest setback for Evans Head product Izack Rodda, who had only recently made his return to the field.


  Rodda is currently training on his own with the Super Rugby season shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic.


  The Wallabies and Queensland Reds second-rower has set up a home gym in Brisbane with the Reds giving players a training program to complete while the season is on hold.


  He was rested for two games of the Super Rugby season after having ankle surgery following the Rugby World Cup in Japan last year.


  The 23-year-old has been a shining light in a struggling Wallabies side and signed a four-year contract last season.


  His name has been floated as a future captain at the Reds with the young Queensland side showing plenty of potential before the recent shutdown.


  He will be at the Reds until at least 2023 with a domestic competition to run against the other Australian Super Rugby teams if competition resumes this year.


  The Reds are coached by dual rugby league and rugby union international Brad Thorn while No 8 Harry Wilson was one of the form players of the competition.


  Rodda, a Lismore rugby junior, left the Far North Coast to finish high school at Ipswich Grammar six years ago and has been part of the Queensland rugby system since.


  “I’m excited to see what the future holds for this Reds team,” Rodda said.


  “We’ve all been together through that Queensland pathway.


  “We’ve all come through together at U20s level and then some made their Super Rugby debuts earlier than others, but we’re all now that same crew who went through with U20s.


  “We’re all very close mates. There are good friendships there and we’re just going to keep building and looking forward to how we go as a team.


  “I’ve been loving my time at the Reds creating friendships and it’s been great to learn under Thorny being an ex-secondrower who’s helped my game.”


  Wollongbar-Alsonville junior and current Rebels front-rower Matt Gibbon has also been training in isolation in Melbourne.


  Rugby Australia has suspended all club activity until at least May 1.

But the Attorney General appealed the sentence, saying while the eight-year head sentence was appropriate, Free should have either been declared a serious violent offender which would require him to serve 80 per cent of the sentence behind bars, or alternatively that the judge should not have set parole eligibility after Free has served one third of the sentence, meaning he would instead become eligible for parole after serving half of the jail term.
