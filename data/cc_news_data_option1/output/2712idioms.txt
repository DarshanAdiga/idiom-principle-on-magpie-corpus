Looking ahead, we maintain a positive outlook for our uranium and gold positions. We expect further appreciation in both this year. We will not seek to add to our uranium exposure (comprised of a 6% position in Kazatomprom and a 3% position in Yellow Cake Uranium). We continue to look for opportunities in the gold sector. The present challenge with gold mining equities is that all the easy buys of the last two years have disappeared. Our previous successes in Barrick, Continental, and our yet to be realized success in Equinox (currently up ~100% for us) were all the result of purchasing stock at rock bottom prices when the world had no interest in gold. The situation has changed. Nevertheless, we believe there remain companies with significant asymmetric return potential in the junior mining space; we just need to find the right management teams and the right assets.

Sununu issued a moratorium on evictions on March 13, but it expired July 1.

Market breadth isn't sending clear signals apart from moving to the bearish territory in the short run. Arguably, that makes its rebound in the coming week likely, as the late-April and late-June experience shows. I don't see a proof that the market character would have changed.

Everything you said was understandable. You were letting off steam.
 For two months you were at the bottom after seeing the franchise you helped put on the map, the Carolina Panthers, choose another guy trying to rehab his career, Teddy Bridgewater.
 Now, you are on top of the world. Bill Belichick, the greatest coach that ever lived, chose you.
 “Bleep you, my haters,” has been the theme.
 Now comes the hard part.
 It is not easy being a Patriot. It’s unlike anything in pro sports.
 Here are five things to understand if you want this experience to match your excitement:
 Only winning matters
 If quarterback rating, a Pro Bowl berth or 30 passes per game (your career average) are important to you, this is not going to work.
 This place is different. If you throw the ball 23 times, and win the game, you are a winner and, get most of the glory as quarterbacks usually do.
 This will be more like your college experience at Auburn, where you made plays and were defined by your success rate.
 Offense won’t revolve around you
 This will be the toughest part of your experience, at least early on. You will be a role player.
 The Tom Brady Offense we became accustomed to disappeared after the 2017 season. Coach Belichick decided defense, ball-control, special teams and clutch play by the quarterback would be the Patriots style. Brady hated it. He wanted a bigger role.
 Now, this could change. Your style, which is move around and create plays, is something we haven’t seen in these parts since Steve Grogan and his neck brace were behind center.
 If you running the ball, on average, five times a game makes this offense better and unpredictable, go for it.
 Money is secondary
 If being a Patriot is important to you, which it appears to be, don’t haggle over money. And I’m not talking about your paltry minimum deal and incentive- laden contract that could net you $7.5 million through December.
 I’m talking 2021 and beyond.
