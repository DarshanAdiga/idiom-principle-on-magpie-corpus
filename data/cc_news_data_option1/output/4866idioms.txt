"It was better, but still we've got a long way to go," Bell said of the UMass quarterback play.


  Dzuro completed only 9-of-22 passes for 172 yards. It was the most yardage thrown for by a UMass quarterback since Randall West went 19 for 36 for 175 yards in a 45-6 loss at Northwestern back on Nov. 16, 2019.


  "I thought he did a great job of driving his eyes to the right place. I thought he did a nice job processing," Bell said of the redshirt freshman. "From a decision-making standpoint, he was OK. There are a few things in the throw game, with the proper drop and footwork that the ball comes out on time. Some of those aren't necessarily bang-bang. There are some physical things to clean up, but as a young player, I thought he did well."


  In a lopsided shutout victory, it is sometimes difficult to point to one or two plays that turned a game around. While it might not be fair to say this exchange led to the blowout victory, UMass played with such a small margin for error that an early play here and there might have meant a lot for the Minutemen. That turnaround happened in the first quarter.


  Liberty used 2 minutes, 28 seconds to go 80 yards on eight plays, with Kevin Shaa scoring on a 31-yard touchdown strike from Malik Willis. Shaa got behind cornerback Noah Boykin on the play.

"The whole year we've been moving the O-line around," Sanders said. "It's just hats off to Coach (Jeff) Stoutland. No matter who's in there Stout's been doing a good job of getting them ready for that weekend and doing a heck of a job of us running the ball no matter who is in there."


  Whatever happens for the 3-6-1 Eagles, Johnson will try to help in any way he can. The prognosis for a complete recovery is good.


  “Moving forward the game always goes on,” Johnson said. “(Jason) Kelce is out there, too, he’s the guy leading them. It's something you can’t control. It’s been frustrating, but I just want to get back to 100 percent and not think about it, play ball and move on from there, which has been difficult for me this year. I’ve seen guys come back from far worse.”

  Look for the Eagles to put Johnson on season-ending injured reserve. Safety Rudy Ford (hamstring) was the only Eagle who didn't practice Friday according to the team's injury report.


  Limited at practice were defensive end Derek Barnett (knee), offensive tackle Jack Driscoll (knee), Kelce (elbow), running back Boston Scott (abdomen) and linebacker Alex Singelton (ankle).
