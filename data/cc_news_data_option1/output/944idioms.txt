Whether he leaves the show or not, Davidson has had quite a lot on his plate the last few years. He has taken on more film roles, including Netflix’s _The Dirt_, _The Suicide Squad_ , _Big Time Adolescence_, and the Judd Apatow- directed movie _The King of Staten Island_ , in addition to his Netflix special. There are still a couple of months left of the current season of _SNL_ before they break for the summer and only time will tell if the 2019-2020 season will be his last.

CAIRO — Revered Arab singer Umm Kulthum returned to light up the stage once more on Friday, almost five decades after her death, in the form of a hologram that delighted a packed-to-capacity crowd at Cairo's Opera House.
 Affectionately known in Egypt as "El Sett" ("The Lady"), Kulthum's deep, resonant voice enthralled the Arab world for decades, inspired Western singers like Bob Dylan and Robert Plant, and can still be heard in Egypt's streets, cafes, taxis and Nile sailboats.
 At the majestic entrance of the Opera House in the Egyptian capital, a large golden plaque bearing her image greeted giddy visitors, along with a placard reading “Star of the East, Umm Kulthum” — her most popular moniker.
 As the curtains were raised, a halo of light appeared in the centre of the stage which transformed into a three-dimensional virtual composition of the singer, sending the audience of more than a thousand into rapturous applause.
 In a nod to her packed concerts of decades ago, the hologram — clad in a bright purple dress and clasping Umm Kulthum’s signature handkerchief — sang from one of her most famous songs, “You toyed with my heart”.
 “I came today because I have always dreamed of attending an Umm Kulthum concert,” Aya Yassin, a professor of medicine at Ain Shams University, told AFP.
 “My grandmother used to tell me about the famous Thursday concerts of hers which made me really interested in coming tonight.”
 Umm Kulthum was born at the end of the 19th century and her career flourished from the 1920s until her death in 1975, taking in an impressive repertoire of religious, patriotic and sentimental songs and poetry.
 Her concerts lasted for hours and her live radio broadcasts attracted huge audiences.
 Friday’s virtual performance comes amid fierce debate over contemporary Egyptian music.
 Last month, the Egyptian musicians’ union banned performances of popular electro street music known as mahraganat, which captures the wild, carefree spirit of Egyptian youth but is viewed by conservatives as overstepping moral boundaries.
 “I am a retired soldier and I made a point of coming here because I miss art that has an ethical component,” Mostafa, a 60-year-old attendee who only gave his first name, told AFP.
 “I’m sick of what the new generation of singers are putting out these days and calling it art. It’s nothing but trash,” he added.
 The performance in Cairo is not the first to feature a hologram of Umm Kulthum. Last year a virtual representation of the singer delighted adoring crowds in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

That’s on the cards again.
 France has to beat Ireland in Paris next Saturday to keep alive its first championship chance in 10 years, then see how England replies.
 The Haouas red card was symptomatic of a France side that was decidedly off even before kickoff. In the warmup, reserve hooker Camille Chat limped off and had to be replaced.
 Romain Ntamack missed a long-range penalty, then dropped a punt and walked off with a head knock in the eighth minute.
 Meanwhile, flanker Francois Cros was sin-binned for a tip tackle, while on his knees, of lock Grant Gilchrist, though it appeared teammate Paul Willemse was more at fault.
 Scotland could add only three points while Clos was off, but France was struggling for the snappy cohesion that marked its wins over England, Italy, and Wales.
 Passes off the rucks, even from star scrumhalf Antoine Dupont, were sloppy, and the scrum was also a liability. Haouas was having trouble holding up his tighthead side against Rory Sutherland.
 Out of nowhere, France scored a great try. Dupont released Gael Fickou down the left touchline, and was set to throw a long pass until he spotted right wing Damian Penaud alone and cross-kicked for a catch and score in the right corner.

DUBAI — Yemen is at a crossroads, the United Nations' envoy to the war-torn country said Saturday, as tens of thousands of people fled the northern province of Al Jawf after fierce clashes.
 Iran-backed Houthi insurgents seized provincial capital Al Hazm earlier this month after heavy fighting with government troops, ending a relative lull in violence that had raised hopes for a more permanent de-escalation.
 "Yemen is, in my view, at a critical juncture: We will either silence the guns and resume the political process, or we will slip back into large-scale conflict", Martin Griffiths said during a visit to Marib province.
 "Fighting needs to stop now. Military adventurism and the quest for territorial gains are futile," he told reporters, according to a transcript provided by his office.
 "They will only drag Yemen to many more years of conflict."
 The latest clashes in northern Yemen came after a months-long relative lull in violence as the warring parties showed an apparent interest in de-escalation.
 But efforts to resume a political process appear to be unravelling.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the fighting between the warring parties in Al-Jawf has displaced tens of thousands of people to Marib province.
 "The ICRC and the Yemen Red Crescent Society have helped around 70,000 people, or 10,000 families, by providing food, tents, blankets, jerrycans, basins and hygiene kits," the agency said in a statement on Saturday.
 "In Al Jawf governorate, increased clashes have hampered efforts to help patients and those in need."
 The loss of the strategic city of Al Hazm means the rebels now threaten oil- rich Marib.
 At least 2,100 displaced families reached Marib on March 1, the UN humanitarian coordination agency OCHA said last week.
 Al Jawf has been mostly controlled by the Houthis, but its capital — only 150 kilometres south of the border with Saudi Arabia — had been in the hands of the government.
 Yemen’s internationally recognised government has been battling the Houthi rebels since 2014 when they captured the capital Sanaa and swathes of the impoverished Arab nation.
 Since the Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015, tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have been killed and millions displaced, in what the UN has termed the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

 Doke, Dotson named Wooden finalists
   
 Kansas' Udoka Azubuike and Devon Dotson are among the 15 finalists named to the 2020 men's national ballot for the John R. Wooden Award presented by Wendy's, the Los Angeles Downtown Athletic Club announced Saturday. Kansas is the only school with multiple players on the ballot.
   
 Kansas, which has had a player on the final ballot for five straight seasons, has had two Wooden Award winners -- Danny Manning in 1988 and Frank Mason in 2017.
   
 Azubuike leads the NCAA in field goal percentage at 75.1%. The Nigerian senior center is the only player in the Big 12 averaging a double-double with 13.7 ppg and 10.4 rpg.
   
 Dotson leads the Big 12 in scoring at 18.2 points per game and steals at 2.1. The sophomore from Charlotte, N.C., ranks among the conference leaders in scoring, steals, free throws made, field goal percentage, assists and assist- to-turnover ratio.
   
 The 44th annual presentation of the Wooden Award to the men's and women's most outstanding college basketball player will be April 10 on ESPN2.
   
 K-State women to host KU
   
 Kansas' women will visit rival Kansas State at 2 p.m. Sunday in the regular- season finale for both teams.
   
 The game at Manhattan's Bramlage Coliseum will mark senior day for K-State's Peyton Williams, Jasauen Beard and Angela Harris. The trio have combined for 78 wins and three postseason appearances with the Wildcats.
   
 Williams, a Topeka native, is nearing the end of a career that ranks among the best in K-State's women's annals. She is the first player in program history with 1,500 or more points, 900 or more rebounds, 200 or more assists, 150 or more steals and 100 or more blocks.
   
 Williams enters the Sunflower Showdown with 1,529 career points and needs 20 more to crack the top 10 on K-State's career list.
   
 K-State will try to post a season sweep of the Jayhawks after claiming a 69-61 win on Jan. 29 in Lawrence.
   
 Duffy sharp as Royals top Reds
   
 At Surprise, Ariz., Danny Duffy struck out six in four scoreless innings for Kansas City, allowing one hit as the Royals defeated a split Cincinnati squad 7-2 Saturday at Surprise Stadium.
   
 Ryan McBroom hit his third spring home run for the Royals (8-7) and Ryan O'Hearn and Matt Reynolds also connected.
   
 Cincinnati starter Sonny Gray gave up three runs on five hits in 2 1/3 innings. He's working on throwing more changeups -- McBroom homered on one of them.

 Orioles lose Mancini to injury
   
 In a gloomy season for the Baltimore Orioles last year, one of their few bright spots was Trey Mancini. Now they'll have to do without him for a while.
   
 The big-hitting Mancini will undergo what the team is calling "a non-baseball- related medical procedure." Manager Brandon Hyde said Saturday that Mancini "is going to miss some time."
   
 The Orioles didn't provide any specifics on Mancini's situation or a timetable for his return.
   
 Mancini hit .291 with 35 home runs and 97 RBIs last year as the O's went 54-108. He has played only five games this spring after earlier dealing with flu-like symptoms.
   
 The 27-year-old outfielder/first baseman last played on March 2, but left the game after two at-bats.
   
 Virus concerns US sports leagues
   
 At Miami, the NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer are all weighing plans to restrict access to locker rooms as a precaution to protect players from exposure to the coronavirus, as concern over the situation continued escalating Saturday.
   
 Further, the NBA has told its teams that it has until Tuesday to develop a "plan to limit the number of team and arena staff ... who interact with players" as part of their response strategies. NBA teams were also told to have an arrangement with an infectious disease specialist and to find a facility that could conduct testing for COVID-19.
   
 No pro games in the U.S. have been called off yet. State officials in Florida said there were two presumptive cases of the virus in Broward County, where the Florida Panthers were facing the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night.
   
 The NBA told teams on Friday to prepare for the possibility of playing games in empty arenas, as some sports leagues in Europe have already done, an idea that Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James said he wanted no part of. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, at the Montreal-Florida game Saturday, would not answer if hockey has gone as far as to prepare for that contingency.

 Recently, the Auditor General’s (AG) report for Financial Year 2018/2019 outlined alarming financial losses at different government offices.   The AG’s report shows that poor coordination between government ministries, agencies and departments continues to cost Ugandans billions in revenue.   However, if government institutions were effectively functioning and following best practices, the losses could be easily avoided, and more taxes could also be collected by Uganda Revenue Authority (URA).   Although the report faults many government agencies, the emphasis seems to be more URA. There is an impression created that URA is performing below target in revenue collection and it is unclear why several government offices are failing to adequately remit payments to URA.
 There is suspicion that corrupt accounting officers, who are benefiting for personal gain, have chosen not to follow the Public Finance and Accounting Regulations.   The AG’s report identifies different high loss areas, case of uncollected taxes and compromised government procurement process. First is Shs54 billion that was never collected due to non-coordination between URA and the Gaming Board. Second is Shs393.8 billion that was never collected due to failure by URA to access the Integrated Financial Information Management System. Third was that National Information Technology Authority-Uganda and Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited were building identical infrastructure on the same routes, such as in Kampala, Malaba, Mbarara, Kasese, Tororo and Karuma.   This, therefore, duplicates investment among government entities, thereby increasing expenditure and maintenance costs.
 The AG’s report implies that tax was collected, but it was not received by URA. In other words, the money disappeared within government offices.   If large amounts of money did not reach URA, why are the culprits not being brought to book? The anti-corruption agencies seem not to have paid much attention to the AG’s report. It is possible that the information of on the losses will simply be filed away, ignored and left to gather dust.   According to URA commissioner general Doris Akol, for July to December 2019, net revenue collected was of Shs9 trillion and posted a growth in revenue of 11.15 per cent compared to the same period FY 2018/2019.
 However, in line with the AG’s report, the revenue collection was much less than the half year expected target of Shs9.7 trillion, being short by Shs697 billion.   Since it is generally accepted that corruption undermines economic growth, in this day and age many countries around the world, including South Africa, Botswana, and Chile are using technology to implement tougher measures and in some cases overhauling government ministries where corrupt officials cause financial loss.   However in Uganda, officials have managed to beat anti-corruption efforts put in place by government and financial haemorrhaging continues.
 Since the digitisation and use of biometric technology of some government processes and procedures, Ugandans had hoped that electronic taxation and improved methods of work would reduce corruption. They were wrong.   The assumption has always been that the more tax collected without losses, government would in turn be able to spend more on its people to cater for the poor and vulnerable in society.   However, the AG’s report doesn’t give citizens much motivation or confidence in government institutions since public trust is being met by an insatiable appetite for corruption by public servants.

Coming off a pair of impressive home wins, the BattleHawks hit the road for the next two weeks, playing at 2 p.m. Sunday in Washington, D.C., against the Defenders before traveling to Tampa Bay for a March 14 game against the Vipers.The BattleHawks are 3-1 atop the XFL’s East, a game up on the Defenders (2-2).“It’s the trust they have in each other,” St. Louis coach Jonathan Hayes said when asked what makes this team special. “We have to become road warriors again. Our guys know we can’t afford to lose focus. We have to make sure we’re tuned in and ready for Washington.”A longtime NFL player and assistant coach, Hayes is a first-year head coach who hasn’t been afraid to ask for help.“I’ve had a lot of experience watching, learning,” he said. “I’ve had good teachers, coaches who’ve helped put me in position so that when this opportunity arose that I would be ready for it. Probably the main one is (longtime Cincinnati Bengals head coach) Marvin Lewis. I was fortunate to be with him 16 years and he taught me a lot. He always would remind me that I was preparing for the future, too. And then he would elaborate on how you should handle certain things and talk about different situations. It gave me an opportunity to see things through his eyes.”Hayes remains close with his former boss.“Oh yeah, we talk all the time,” Hayes said, chuckling. “Trust me, I still use him as a sounding board all the time. Marvin and I grew up together; we’ve been friends forever.”Hayes will run into another old friend Sunday, Washington defensive coordinator Louie Cioffi. He was a Bengals defensive assistant from 1997-2002.“We were together in Cincinnati for a long time and Louie does a great job of calling their defenses,” Hayes said. “I know some of the things he likes to do. We still have to block them, but they’re going to have to tackle us, too.”DC opened the season with home wins over Seattle (31-19) and New York (27-0). But it dropped its last two on the road, 39-9 to Los Angeles and 25-0 to previously winless Tampa Bay.“They’re a big strong team and they play different when they’re at home,” BattleHawks running back Matt Jones said. “They like playing at home and I’m sure they’ll feel that way after a couple of road losses. We just have to go in ready to play our game.”Defenders quarterback Cardale Jones, a former Ohio State standout, has completed 55 percent of his passes for 674 yards with four touchdowns and six interceptions.DC’s top rusher is Donnel Pumphrey (131 yards). Top receivers are Rashad Ross (10 catches, 182 yards, one TD) and Eli Rogers (18 catches, 162 yards).“We’re at their place and they’re 2-0 at home this season,” BattleHawks quarterback Jordan Ta’amu said of the Defenders. “Our game plan really doesn’t change much from week to week — we try to focus on what we do and make plays. I feel that if everyone in this locker room does that, we’ll find a way to keep it going.”More seats for LA gameAfter drawing two of the top three crowds in the XFL through four weeks — 29,554 vs. New York and 27,527 last week against Seattle — the BattleHawks have made more seating available at The Dome at America’s Center for their next home game, March 21 against the Los Angeles Wildcats.The upper-bowl seats went on sale Friday and started at $15. Team officials declined to say how many were sold, but it is believed to be a few thousand. BattleHawks president Kurt Hunzeker tweeted that the team twice had to open up more sections after the first offering. It is the first time the team is selling seats in the upper deck.Ta’amu is honoredAfter falling short through the first three weeks of the season, Ta’amu was named XFL player of the week. In last weekend’s 23-16 win over visiting Seattle, he completed 20 of 27 passes for 264 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed 16 times, for 63 yards.“Big win for us, team effort, but I’m super- honored and blessed to get the MVP for the week,” Ta’amu said. “Excited to throw it a little more, but that’s the beauty of this offense, we can run and pass, which makes it dangerous for our opponents.”Ta’amu threw passes to eight receivers, including five for 71 yards and a touchdown to De’Mornay Pierson-El and four for 41 yards to former Mizzou standout L’Damian Washington.For the season, Ta’amu has completed 82 of 109 passes for 876 yards with five touchdowns and two interceptions. He’s fifth in the league in rushing, with 186 yards.“I’m a dual-threat guy and I love running the football, but I also love throwing,” Ta’amu said.The former Ole Miss player’s dream is to play in the NFL, but for now he sees the XFL as an opportunity.“When I was in college, I felt like I could play at the next level, the top level, and that’s my goal,” he said.As a reminder of his competitiveness, Ta’amu showed off a nearby ping pong bracket with him listed as champion.“We had 16 guys and I came out on top,” he said. “If you ever want to challenge me in ping pong, I’m here.”

As mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders backed Jackson in his 1988 campaign, in which Biden was also a candidate.Jackson said Sanders made several commitments to him, including introducing a constitutional amendment on the right to vote in Congress next week, expanding Pell Grants, nominating an African-American woman to the Supreme Court and naming black women to his cabinet if he is elected president.The civil rights leader also challenged Sanders to select an African-American woman as his running mate, which Jackson said the senator would give "the highest consideration."Jackson's endorsement comes as the race for the Democratic presidential nomination has narrowed significantly, with Sanders and Biden emerging as the two frontrunners.Biden surged in the national delegate race, which he now leads, following a sweep of Super Tuesday states, though California — the biggest prize — is leaning toward Sanders.Sanders is now focusing on Michigan, a key battleground state where more than 100 delegates are up for grabs Tuesday.

“You have to pay for goals. This is football. My suggestions were to maintain the team. but for business decisions, we lost Miku and Xisco (Hernandez). Raphael (Augusto) got in but he could play only nine games. (Manuel) Onwu could play six games. But it shows how good the team is. There was a Plan A but with Plan B, we remained one step or just one goal away from a final. (Albert) Serran and Nishu (Kumar) were missed today. Without the penalty, we would have been in the final,” said Cuadrat.

Thomas Müller scored as Bayern Munich beat Augsburg 2-0 on Sunday to extend its lead to four points in the chase for an eighth straight Bundesliga title.
 Tenacious Augsburg defending left Bayern with few clear scoring chances. Instead of intricate passing, old-fashioned direct football won the day as Müller scored in the 53rd off a long pass over the top from Jerome Boateng.
 Manuel Neuer made a key save to keep the three points in Munich, parrying Florian Niederlechner’s low shot in the 80th minute, with Augsburg unable to score from the rebound. Niederlechner put the ball in the net in the 89th but was offside.
 The game could have been over by then but Joshua Zirkzee and Serge Gnabry each missed excellent chances as Augsburg pushed forward seeking to level the score.
