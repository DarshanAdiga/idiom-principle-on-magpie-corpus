Through multiple lockdowns and workplace restrictions, companies have altered the way they think about and use their commercial office space because of the COVID-19 pandemic. West Michigan real estate experts say this will carry over into 2021, but the extent of how much a business will be affected in the new year is extremely industry-specific. Most office and retail users will be in better shape than business owners in hospitality that do not own their building — especially non-fast food restaurants, said Mark Ansara, vice president of Colliers International’s West Michigan office. “It’s harder for a restaurant that’s leasing than one that owns their own real estate that can work with their bank,” Ansara said. “Some landlords are forgiving and some are not.” The firm hasn’t seen any new restaurant leases unless the facility has a drive-thru window, Ansara added. “Restaurants and bars are not able to be open right now, and are already bleeding. And there are not enough Band-Aids in the world to stop the bleeding,” Ansara said. “They can’t survive with just takeout.” Larger chain restaurants are struggling as well, but they are better positioned than local eateries, according to experts. “The local guys without the deep pockets are the ones hanging on by a thread,” he said. Hospitality businesses including restaurants are all affected by the lack of entertainment downtown, according to experts. “Our downtowns are alive and well when we have entertainment, but we do not have a vibrant downtown right now,” Ansara said. “It’s just another layer of the challenge.” Empty offices also mean fewer people patronizing downtown restaurants and businesses, said David Wiener, senior vice president of Colliers’ West Michigan office. Experts divided on office space Wiener said expert opinions vary widely when it comes to the demand for office space through 2021. “Our office at Colliers is seeing a couple things we want to keep a close eye on,” he said. “Some people have been working from home and have gotten comfortable doing that. But we also believe that businesses are going to need more in-person activity to keep their sales up and driving what they do.” Some clients are considering adding square footage per employee to socially distance. The “million dollar question” is whether employers need to increase current office space to accommodate social distancing or whether enough employees working from home will offset the need for more space, Wiener said. Colliers is also seeing more companies signing short-term lease extensions that would typically be for five to 10 years. “About half of the (office space) experts will say you’ll need less space and half will say you’ll need more space,” Wiener said. “We do know that if the workforce is back working at full capacity that there will need to be an increase in office space for social distancing.” A majority of the 2,000 office workers Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) surveyed in 10 countries said they want to work remotely more than two days a week on average, which is twice as much as pre- pandemic. Three-quarters of employees reported they want to continue working from home on a regular basis, according to the survey. Yet nearly three- quarters of survey respondents said they want the ability to come into an office, and 70 percent consider it the best place for team building and connecting with management. “Companies of all kinds are seizing a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity to change the office model and lean into workforce preferences,” JLL Director of Global Research Marie Puybaraud said in a statement. Before the pandemic, the office market had become “highly densified” over the years, said Jeff Karger, senior vice president of JLL in Grand Rapids. “We used to talk about 200-350 square feet per person, and a lot of companies had gotten that down to 100-200 square feet per person, really packing people in,” Karger said. “There will be a de-densification, so some businesses might need a little extra space or the same space because they can spread out more if some employees continue working from home.” Karger said the amount of subleased space on the market has increased, which could indicate some downsizing. “We’ve seen an increase in sublease space not just downtown but across the board, which is a result of companies working more from home or not doing very well or both,” he said. Looking ahead Wiener classifies 2021 as a year in which companies will “wait and see.” He said none of his clients have defaulted on office leases, and almost every client is paying their rent on time despite most offices working remotely. Some predictions at the beginning of the pandemic said offices might relocate from downtowns to the suburbs. In West Michigan this year, large companies have moved offices from downtown to the suburbs, and vice versa. If downsizing office space proves to be a trend for 2021, Karger noted the potential for some downtown office space being considered for residential use. “Whether it’s a change of use to apartments or hotels, I could see a project or two changing,” he said. “I think landlords will be looking at all their options.”

DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) - Those who still need to make a visit to Santa at Carillon Park have one more full day to do it, and like most other things this year, the process will look quite different.      Vice President of museum operations for Dayton History, Alex Heckman, said like everyone else, Santa is being careful not to catch or spread COVID.      “Santa Claus is located behind an area where there's a large set of wrapped Christmas presents. And so there's a nice social-distanced barrier between our visiting public and Santa.”      Santa is also wearing a mask this year, so the kids won’t be able to see his jolly old smile. But they can still tell him what’s on their lists or write him a handwritten letter on paper straight from Dayton History's printing press. And in addition to Santa's adjustments, Carillon Park has put some barriers in place to ensure families stay safe and healthy.      "Basically, we strongly urge everyone to purchase their tickets online ahead of time," explained Heckman. "That allows them access to the entire Carillon Historical Park campus and all of the Christmas lights and Christmas programming, including a visit with Santa Claus.”      They’re also requiring that visitors wear masks and they’ve laid out social distancing markers for families in line to see Santa. And even if only to stay on his nice list, Heckman said everyone is doing a great job of following the rules.      “People have really been pleased that we have a Carillon Christmas occurring. People thank us every night…for having a great, safe place for individuals and families and small groups to enjoy.”      And before gathering his gifts and reindeer for his annual trip, Santa gave a message to kids in the Miami Valley.

The coronavirus has made its way to Antarctica, which had been the last continent without any positive cases, according to Chile officials.
 Thirty-six people at the Bernado O'Higgins research station tested positive for COVID-19, Chilean news network 24 Horas reported. The research station is operated by the Chilean Army.
 Of the 36 positive cases, 26 are military personnel and the other 10 are maintenance workers, BBC reported. They have all been evacuated to Chile, BBC said.
 The base recently underwent its annual exchange of personnel, according to The Antarctic Report.
 Personnel who traveled from Chile to Antarctica had to quarantine and be tested before the trip, according to Chilean publication La Prensa Austral, but the virus was still brought to the desolate continent.
 Three crew members on board the ship taking the infected personnel back to Chile also tested positive, La Prensa Austral reported.
 In the northern tip in west Antarctica, the base's location is called "hard to reach even by Antarctic terms," Australian news outlet ABC.net reported.
 There have been more than 589,000 cases of the coronavrius in Chile, which is the fifth most in South America, according to Johns Hopkins University.
 Around 1,000 scientists travel to Antarctica during the winter at the continent's 40 year-round bases, the Associated Press reported in September.
 The virus was deemed "high risk with potential catastrophic consequences" if it ever reached Antarctica, according to documents seen by the AP from the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs. Thirty countries make up the council.

(CNN) – Americans are expressing less reluctance about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, based on two recent surveys.“An ABC poll this week, more than 8 in 10 Americans say they plan to take the vaccine and Kaiser today announced 70%, so just vaccine confidence is surging,” said Health and Human Services Sec. Alex Azar.But the numbers are lower within the black community.Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to get infected, more likely to be hospitalized and more likely to die from COVID-19 than whites.A new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation found 35% of black adults say they probably or definitely would not get vaccinated.“The black community, communities of color, we cannot sit on the sideline whereby other communities don’t and they receive the added protection of the vaccine,” said Dr. Leon McDougle, president of the National Medical Association. “That’s only going to worsen our outcomes.”Of the Black adults who say they won’t get vaccinated, 47% cite a distrust in vaccines in general, while 50% are worried they will contract COVID from the vaccine.“I highly recommend that when our turn comes up for the vaccine, that we receive the vaccine,” McDougle said.Black health experts are also reaching out to coalitions, clergy and churches hoping to spread the word about vaccine safety.Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.

An invisibility cloak may seem like a disguise suitable for only science fiction or fantasy, but a few deep sea fishes get close to the real thing. Smithsonian and Duke University scientists found ultra-black fishes--like the Pacific blackdragon, the anglerfish and the black swallower--have a special arrangement of black pigments within their skin that absorb at least 99.5 percent of light. For comparison, black construction paper only absorbs 10 percent. Why would a fish that lives in a place void of sunlight resort to such tactics? Deep sea creatures commonly produce flashy displays of bioluminescence to attract prey, so an ultra-black skin can help fish in the vicinity avoid illumination. Ultra-black coloration can even help hide a predator fish from its own light. This oceanic discovery may spark innovations including ultra-black materials that could be used as camouflage for night ops.
