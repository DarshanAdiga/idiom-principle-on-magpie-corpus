CORRIN: Well, my casting process was very unusual, I think actually. I'll explain it, but I feel like any young actor listening should not think that this is how it normally works, which is that, so I went in August 2018. Got a call from my agent. She said, _The Crown_ are doing a chemistry read between the girls they had found to play Camilla potentially, and Joshua O'Connor. But obviously they're reading scripts that are from season three and also season four, which was obviously in the pipeline. And they need someone to read for Diana. And so I went in and I was paid and obviously, it wasn't an audition for me. I was just helping out, but it weirdly turned into an audition, because they started putting me on camera and they were obviously enjoying what I was doing. And it was quite strange.

It is clear that the main concern of the German gambling authority is to protect players from developing problematic gambling habits, and to keep underage players out of online casinos. The UKGC have been a guiding light in this regard, but the ISTG 2021 restrictions are such that it will be difficult for the German gambling industry to rake in the level of revenue enjoyed by the UK and other major gambling hubs. How players react to the ISTG 2021 remains to be seen. Casual players are unlikely to feel the pinch, but high- rollers and professional gamblers will surely be looking to take their gambling habits elsewhere.

WINSLET: There are obviously many things that I grew to appreciate about Mary Anning, but the one thing I could say was that Mary was incredibly uncomplaining. Even though she lived this awfully impoverished, very, very harsh, hard life, she somehow still had unbelievable passion for what she did for her livelihood. She knew that she was selling her fossils to rich, powerful men who were not as clever as her. She knew that she wasn’t being credited for those finds. Yet somehow, Mary never became bitter or resentful or pissed off. She was very compassionate. She was extremely wise. She shared had knowledge with those men and those scientists who were inquiring from her daily about what she had found and what would be a good place to go dig and look. She was a resource to those people and she gave her knowledge freely and openly. She was just a kind and good human being. That, for me, was something that I really kept in my mind. It would’ve been easy to play her as an angry person, given the construction of the story and the time in her life that our story finds her. She’s tired in our story and she’s poor, and she doesn’t have much of an outlook of any kind, at all. She just keeps going for the sake of her mother but she was able to feel compassion and to show extraordinary affection and care for Charlotte when Charlotte is dying. If it weren’t for Mary, Charlotte wouldn’t have made it. It was really important to me that we got to see that very compassionate side of Mary Anning because, in truth, it really did exist. And so, that was the biggest take home about her, for me. She was this very uncomplaining, stoic pack horse of a woman who just kept going. I admire women like that in general.

The final episode of the season shows Diana’s successful solo tour to New York City in 1989, including a visit to a Harlem hospital. Here, Morgan displays the level of empathy the princess showed toward the sick, which made her beloved across the globe. When Diana asks why people don’t want to adopt these kids, the doctor explains it is “Because of the stigma. The fear of the disease.” In front of the cameras, Diana embraces the young boy and is met with gasps making it seem like the first time she has done this, but this is far from the case. In April 1987, she opened the first purpose-built HIV/AIDS ward at the London Middlesex Hospital, and her lack of apprehension was noted by the media. She didn’t wear gloves and was photographed shaking the hands of a patient, a simple gesture that had a huge impact. It does a disservice to Diana and the LGBTQ community that Season 4 ignores this landmark moment that shifted public perception. It should be noted that she also hugged patients in Harlem, but it was far from the first time.

Defund the police clearly deals with the desire to move funding away from policing and into more productive social programs.

When the lights go out in WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), the deafening silence among fans at the stadium is hard not to notice. It only takes a couple of seconds to send them into a trance, when the operator plays the sound of a bell tolling, which gets amplified in a cacophony of loud cheers and wolf-whistles.


  There emerges a man, a deadman to be precise, from the darkness. His mystical aura, coupled with eerie theme music, smokes and fireworks, has made him a messiah and a pop culture phenomenon, for nearly three decades. Mark William Calaway, more known by his ring name The Undertaker, has been a towering figure for those born in the ‘90s and grew up in the noughties.


  Naturally, there was palpable excitement when a handful of journalists from across the globe joined a Zoom call to meet “The Deadman”, ahead of his farewell on Survivor Series 2020, a pay-per-view event. Everyone had an Undertaker memory to share and everyone, perhaps, owned a piece of him. “I have been around for a while, for a while now,” says Mark Calaway, 55, from Austin, Texas, USA.


  Three years back, The Undertaker “broke” his character for the first time at WrestleMania 33 when he was defeated by Roman Reigns in a dramatic win, which sealed Taker’s fate and brought his unparalleled WrestleMania record down to 23-2. Needless to say, it was the last straw. Taker left his hat, gloves and trench coat at the centre of the ring, along with his 27-year-long career, and kissed his wife Michelle McCool, who was in the audience. It was an emotional moment for fans; #TakerRetires was on everyone’s lips but never spoken out loud. The Deadman, as he is known, came back the next year, and has since made sporadic returns to WWE.

However, it was in the WWE-produced docuseries _The Last Ride_ , a documentary that gave an insider’s look into The Undertaker’s career, where he announced his decision to call it a day. Earlier in June, Taker made it official. He has not yet figured out his Plan B, although there have been whispers that a career in politics might be on the cards. “I’m still looking back and somehow amazed at my 30-plus years in the industry. It’s not that I am no longer part of WWE after this Sunday; it has always been my place,” he begins, “Though you may not see me very often in the ring, I’ll still be around working with upcoming talent, sharing my insight and experience.”


  ## The Man, The Myth, The Legend


  The Undertaker has been a headliner on numerous occasions and has fought wrestlers in a range of fights — from Locker Room Brawl, Hell In A Cell, Casket Matches to Inferno, in which the stage was set ablaze. While preparation is one aspect for such marquee events, Calaway feels that it was important for him to take time out and think on the events that led up to that particular match. “When you are going to be buried alive in a match, obviously there have been serious things that have happened along the way to get to this point. That’s why it has always been about storytelling and not so much about moves,” says the 6-foot-10-inch tall star.

Popular gaming platform Roblox, a pandemic sensation among children, is aiming to raise $1 billion in an initial public offering, according to documents published Thursday.


  The online phenomenon, which allows users to create their own immersive 3D games, reported revenue of $589 million for the nine months to September and an operating cash flow of $345 million.


  According to the IPO filing, the California-based company is not yet profitable, reporting a net loss of $203.2 million in the nine months ending in September.


  The size of the offering was listed at $1 billion, though that will likely change, according to Bloomberg.


  Roblox is a massive hit among seven to 13-year-olds, who can use the platform to play games across a range of devices and systems including iOS, Android, PC, Mac, and Xbox. Developers get a share of any related revenue.


  Videogaming has exploded since the start of coronavirus crisis as millions of people have been forced to stay at home.

From now on, we will move even faster along the path of development. We have achieved what we wanted on the battlefield. Our soldiers and officers showed their strength. We have shown our strength in the political sphere, and the trilateral statement fully meets our interests. This is why this statement was signed in front of the eyes of the whole world, by the President of Russia and myself. It is still impossible to say where the Armenian prime minister signed it. But that doesn't matter much. It doesn't matter if it happened in a warehouse, a locked-up room or a bunker in which he lives. His signature is there. It is, in fact, an act of capitulation. This is the Victory of Azerbaijan, the return of our lands and the raising of our flag. Fizuli, Jabrayil, Zangilan, Gubadli, Hadrut, Sugovushan, Murov Mountain and Shusha were liberated from the occupiers on the battlefield, including several villages of Lachin district and a part of Kalbajar district. This is what conditioned our victory. Our victory has already created big problems in Armenia. But look at the reaction of international organizations. Is there a reaction? No! Every day an opposition leader gets arrested in Armenia in a completely unfounded manner. Has any Western country reacted to this? No! Did they condemn it? No! Leaders of major opposition parties have been arrested, but no-one speaks up. Where are you, the Council of Europe? Where is the Council of Europe, which despises Azerbaijan and tries to discredit us? Why are you tight-lipped? Or the monitoring committee. Several rapporteurs for Azerbaijan have been appointed there. Armenia must be monitored. Why are you silent, the Council of Europe? Where are your leaders, where is your monitoring committee, where is the political committee? Don't you see that there are repressions in Armenia? Can't you see that the dictator is doing whatever he pleases? In fact, a defeated dictator, a humiliated dictator. So why don't you speak up? Where is your democracy, where are your human rights? Is there an answer? No! And there won't be one. Even after my words, there will be none. They will cover it up, hush it up. The European Parliament has adopted more than 10 ugly and false resolutions against Azerbaijan. Why are you silent, the European Parliament? You consider yourself the center of democracy in the world. Speak up, make a statement, make a statement and condemn this. A dictator destroys all the opposition right in front of everyone in the world. He kills a man. One of the persons who occupied the parliament has already been found dead. Why don't you speak up? Why? Non- governmental organizations which regularly campaign against us, why are you silent, why don't you speak up? When we were hit with a ballistic missile, you were silent, when we were hit with cluster munitions and phosphorus bombs, you remained tight-lipped. Great countries, countries that claim to European leaders, why are you silent? Tell me, answer me! But it turns out that anyone can come and lecture us here. I am answering all of them, all of them, and with a vengeance.

We will expose these lies about the number of refugees, and even if there were refugees, it is not our fault. We did not fight against the civilian population. They are the ones who fought against our civilian population. We have 94 martyrs among civilians and more than 400 wounded civilians. More than 3,000 houses have been destroyed. Their losses among civilians are much lower. However, they targeted our civilians in cities and villages. Ganja was hit by ballistic missiles. They hit Barda with cluster bombs, with phosphorus bombs. This is a war crime. The city of Tartar is almost destroyed. The largest number of shells fell on Tartar. Every morning, I was told how many shells landed there. One day, two thousand shells fell on a small town. Isn't this Armenian savagery? Isn't it a repeat of the Khojaly genocide? See who we were faced with and who we defeated? I repeat: we have not only restored our territorial integrity, we have also broken the back of Armenian fascism. We have saved the region from Armenian fascism, we have saved the world from Armenian fascism. It may resurrect but we will not allow that to happen. Everyone should know that. We will take any steps necessary to defend ourselves. We will take any steps necessary to protect our citizens, and no- one can stop us. The whole world saw that in 44 days. No-one can stand in front of us or put forward conditions to us. In the early days of the war, representatives of the countries that wanted to impose conditions on us, to threaten us, to slander us, some Western countries - they received our harsh response. They saw that we were not a country that bows to others. Neither am I a leader who accepts everything, any word. I have responded to them with a vengeance and will continue to do so if necessary. Therefore, if Armenian fascism rises again, if any provocation is committed against us, they will receive 10 times more and no-one can stop us.

"We will take the stakeholders' comments very seriously. We do hope that through the budget we will be able to rejuvenate the city while moving towards attaining the smart city that we want," he said.      The proposed budget has since started receiving backlash from residents. Harare Residents Trust director Mr Precious Shumba said the rates increases are wild, unscientific and lack sincerity on the part of the City of Harare.      "Their desperation for revenues is unmatched by their level of service provision. They do not have a proper billing system," he said.      "The proposed rates discount the socio-economic conditions of ratepayers. Most citizens are unemployed, and the Covid-19 outbreak makes their situation worse."      Combined Harare Residents Association programmes manager Mr Reuben Akili said the budget was unacceptable and any policymaker with reasoning capacity could not agree to such.      "They need to address the fundamentals that are discouraging residents to pay their bills. Currently they have a non-functional billing system and their books where last audited in 2017," he said.      Zimbabwe National Organisation of Associations and Residents Trust head Mr Shepherd Chikomba said they should provide service delivery first before these "exorbitant inhuman increases".      "As residents we are tired of these hikes yet service delivery is not changing. We are getting water twice a week, why can't they hike the rate at which residents can get running tape water they need to justify these figures. The percentage increase is just out of this world.      "We need quality service delivery assurance. We wonder if the council is going to deliver or they will come up with other excuses after these recent hikes. City of Harare has failed and it is for all to see," he said.

"The NPA welcomes the decision of the court to forfeit the property to the State given the fact that the property was a guarantee that the accused have put in terms of their bail conditions. They have contravened their bail conditions and therefore as part of the process, they have to forfeit that property," Ngwema said.      The Bushiris maintain they have done nothing wrong and claim they fled to their home country for safety reasons and because they were worried they would not get a fair trial.

Orlando Hall got stiffed on a drug deal and went to a Texas apartment looking for the two brothers who took his money. They weren’t home, but their 16-year- old sister was.
 Late Thursday, Hall was put to death for abducting and killing the teenager, Lisa Rene. His was the eighth federal execution this year since the Trump administration revived a process that had been used just three times in the past 56 years. A judge’s stay over concerns about the execution drug gave Hall a reprieve, but for less than six hours. After the Supreme Court overturned the stay, he was put to death just before midnight.
 Hall, a changed man in prison according to his lawyers and a church volunteer who had grown close to him, was consoling his family and supporters at the end. “I’m OK,” he said in a final statement, then adding, “Take care of yourselves. Tell my kids I love them.”
 As the drug was administered, Hall, 49, lifted his head, appeared to wince briefly and twitched his feet. He appeared to mumble to himself and twice he opened his mouth wide, as if he was yawning. Each time that was followed by short, seemingly labored breaths. He then stopped breathing. Soon after, an official with a stethoscope came into the execution chamber to check for a heartbeat before Hall was officially declared dead.

Children’s Garden Christmas in Edisto Memorial Gardens with its million lights is a special part of Orangeburg’s Christmas. In year 28, it’s the best no-admission-fee experience with lights and decor that you will find anywhere.


  And in no year is the normalcy of the City of Orangeburg's Christmas decor more to be welcomed. Driving through the gardens and around downtown to see the lights is perfectly acceptable amid the coronavirus pandemic and its protocols.


  But even the holiday sights and lights have been impacted by COVID-19.

Virgil van Dijk’s recovery is going so well that the Daily Mail reckon Liverpool’s Dutchman might play again this season.
 They reported last night that our brilliant no.4, the best defender on the planet, is already in light recovery training following his successful operation on his knee.
 It’s already been a month since that Jordan Pickford challenge which ruined van Dijk’s campaign – but despite the plethora of other injuries we’ve also had to deal with – the side has largely done pretty well in his absence.
 Of course, we shouldn’t necessarily put a timeframe on it – and allow van Dijk to get fit in his own time. He’s physically phenomenal and we reckon he’ll fly though his recovery period – but it’s crucial we don’t put pressure on it.
 We top the Champions League Group and are just one point off Premier League leaders Leicester City, knowing a win will fire us to top spot on Sunday evening.
 Beating Brendan Rodgers’ side though is going to be a monumental ask considering the sheer number of players unavailable to Jurgen Klopp, but if anyone can do it, he can.

Any challenge she had, she overcame with her zest for life, determination and her strong spirit. She loved life and lived it to the absolute fullest. Special thanks to all of the staff and her Community Living family, whom always treated her with so much love and respect. We are extremely grateful to them for their many years of dedicated support. Thanks to the ER staff at West Lincoln Memorial Hospital for their care and compassion.

There may be complications and delays in winding up the estate of late businessman Genius "Ginimbi" Kadungure as the will submitted this week is unsigned, with the Master's Office at the High Court now calling a meeting of family members and other potential beneficiaries for next week to sort out the way forward and deal with administrative details such as the appointment of the executor.      It is understood, although this cannot be confirmed, that the bulk of the estate, including the businesses and Domboshava mansion are to be assigned to a trust under the unsigned will although there are individual beneficiaries, including it is said someone called "KIT KAT" who is the listed heir of Kadungure's Lamborghini vehicle.      The will would probably make it clear who would be sharing the revenue from the proposed trust as well as who would be the trustees, or at least how these would be appointed.      Generally the wishes of a dead person expressed in a will are followed, although the law makes provision for the continued maintenance of those being looked after by the estate before the death, along with other concerns.      The picture collage shows Genius "Ginimbi'' Kadungure's Domboshava mansion and his fleet of fast and expensive cars A Harare man, Mr Nomatter Zinyengere, claiming to be Mr Kadungure's best friend, this week registered the deceased's estate and unsuccessfully tried to push the Master of High Court into accepting the unsigned will.      Although Genius's father Anderson Kadungure and sisters Juliet and Neria were listed as possible beneficiaries of the estate, Mr Zinyengere has been leading the legal process.      It was not immediately clear if Mr Zinyengere was "KIT-KAT". An online check identified Zinyengere as the director of a South African registered company called KAT Group, which was incorporated in August 2019.      The will shows that Kadungure owned the Domboshava mansion, a company called Infinity Gas, an undisclosed fleet of vehicles and several other companies.      The custodians of the unsigned will, Ranros Estate Administrators, wrote a cover letter seeking the speedy acceptance of the unsigned document as the actual last will and testament for the distribution of the estate.      They argued that some of Kadungure's companies in Botswana have stopped operating since that country requires an estate to be reported to the authorities before operations can resume.      "The deceased died before signing his last will and testament. We are therefore kindly asking your office to urgently convene a meeting with all beneficiaries so that you can accept the will and issue the court sealed letters of administration.

For the story Gatti sees in the income reports to be true, most everything Ferrante put into words in her written interviews would have to be false. What would be her motivation? She isn’t a postmodernist, she does not delight in word games, she is not obsessed with “outwitting” her readers. Her contract with her audience is that she will bare to the bone human jealousy, shame, ambition, and attachment, among other unruly impulses. That kind of writer is unlikely to giddily set out to fool her readers. She would simply, in the stern tone she at times adopts, refuse the question. For Raja to be Ferrante, she would also need to demonstrate odd fixations, for example be someone who obsessed across multiple books and many thousands of pages about a city-- Naples--that, according to Gatti’s hypothesis, she left as a toddler and then only reunited with in spirit after marrying a Neapolitan in Rome. The coarse brutality of that city would only have been imagined by her and not bled from her.

It was proved that after the heated scuffle Nyamujara left the scene and came back later armed with a kitchen knife which he used to stab the complainant once on the left side of the cheek.      After the brutal attack, Chikuvadze sustained a deep cut and was referred to hospital for medication. The matter was reported to the police leading to his arrest.      The accused denied the charge and in his defence outline, he told the court that the complainant was source of the problem because of his violent nature.      He said on the day in question, and knowing the complainant's violent tendencies whenever he got drunk, after finishing opaque beer he changed drinking partners but the complainant followed him and started drinking beer that he had bought.      "I bought another bottle of hot stuff, and told the complainant that I didn't want to share it with him but he (complainant) forced himself on it. When I asked for my hot stuff, the complainant started slapping me. This led to an altercation resulting in us grappling with each other. At the height of that grappling, we both fell to the ground," said Nyamujara.      He further told the court that when he got up, he realised that Chivaudze was bleeding.      "I didn't know or see what caused the injury but the area on which we grappled was littered with broken beer bottles and I suspected that he was cut when we fell down.      "I however, assisted him by taking him to Mzilikazi Police Station where he later told police officers that it was me who had stabbed him leading to my arrest," said Nyamujara.      His defence didn't however, save him from the jaws of the prison when the magistrate handed him a package of 30 months behind bars for the crime.

The borough of Tamaqua will receive more than a half-million dollars thanks to its participation in the City Revitalization and Improvement Zone program.


  Officials noted that $538,980 will come to the borough for redevelopment and revitalization, and must be directed to parcels in the designated CRIZ.


  Daniel Evans, chairman of the Tamaqua CRIZ Authority, called the receipt “good news.”


  “I want to thank the community for their support of our local businesses in the CRIZ zone,” Evans said. “We continue to see a vibrant business community with local support. Basically, the numbers bear that out in the 2019 CRIZ allocation.”


  The CRIZ program was established in 2013 and amended in 2016 to encourage growth in areas that have been underutilized.


  Tamaqua is the only borough in the program, which is administered by the state departments of revenue, community and economic development and the governor’s budget office. The cities of Lancaster and Bethlehem are the other participants.


  Evans talked about the program’s successes, along with some ongoing projects.


  For example, he said, the Tamaqua CRIZ is participating in the expansion of Boyer’s Market on Cedar Street.


  Evans noted that the supermarket is planning an addition to maximize its space. Another extension will be utilized by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board for a Fine Wine and Good Spirits shop. He said the shop will also sell beer. He believes both additions should be complete by late spring.


  Previous CRIZ funding that funneled into Tamaqua helped with the relocation of Child Development Inc. to the former St. Jerome Elementary Center, 255 W. Broad St.


  “2019 was the first full year that Child Development was up and running there,” he said. “We are super-excited at what they were able to do with the former St. Jerome Elementary Center — and they added 20 seats to the program. They did a super job on the property and we’re really excited to participate with them in the project.”


  CRIZ funding also helped bring The Wheel Restaurant to Tamaqua. A popular Pottsville eatery, The Wheel’s second location opened at 125 E. Broad St. this summer


  “We were very excited to participate in bringing The Wheel to Tamaqua. It is in the former Wenzel’s Bakery site, which has a lot of history in Tamaqua,” Evans said.


  A CRIZ is an area of up to 130 acres, comprised of parcels designated by the local CRIZ authority to capture state and local taxes for the purpose of improvement and development within the zone. CRIZ funding can be used for reimbursement of debt service, property acquisition, new construction and other costs related to development. The intent of the program is to revive downtown areas through new and existing businesses and to attract development, improve underutilized real estate and encourage local business expansions.


  Tamaqua CRIZ Authority meetings are held on the first and the third Monday of the month at 6 p.m. via Zoom. Zoom information is posted on the Tamaqua Borough website via the News tab. There is potential for the first meeting of the month to be cancelled. Call the borough at 570-668-0300 to verify meeting dates and times.

There is no more obvious criminal than Donald Trump. Forget 3 strikes. Trump has had a thousand. He has set new standards for political corruption as he has explicitly used the office of the Presidency for personal enrichment, largely by cutting health and safety standards that endanger the lives of the American people. He has again and again abused the law and Democrats have failed to hold him unaccountable. Failing to do so sets a new precedent for how politicians can behave. Just as letting George W. Bush off the hook for war crimes has eroded the willingness of the US to follow international law, domestic policy will be eroded as Trump is given a pass to openly undermine government agencies. Letting Trump go is a painfully obvious humiliation that the Democrats, haunted by Trump, won’t recover from. Making fascism legal is yet another sign to Trump’s minority that the law is on their side.

In the wake of escalation of border tensions between Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has requested Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik to convene an all party-meeting over the border disputes with neighbouring states. In a letter to the Chief Minister, Pradhan also urged him to seek the support of the Central government in mediating a resolution for boundary disputes. The letter was released to the media on Thursday. Union Minister Pradhan, who hails from Odisha, wrote the letter in the wake of fresh tensions at Sunabeda village in Pottangi block of Koraput district, along the Odisha-Andhra border. Odisha has a long history of border disputes with all these neighbouring states owing to historical, cartographic and geological reasons, said Union Minister Pradhan. He further said, While borders might seem absolute on paper, they will always remain porous to the underlying societal norms, cultures, languages shared by the people on both sides, while adding, in view of the above, it would seem prudent to arrive at an effective and comprehensive resolution of Odishas ongoing and long standing border disputes with all its neighbouring states, i.e. Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, through bilateral discussions with these states. According to a report in NIE, the row broke out after residents of four Andhra villages and Visakhapatnam revenue officials allegedly removed a signboard set up by Odisha officials from the original position and pushed it 500 metres back into the Odisha side. Soon, with the issue escalating, officials from Odishas Pottangi block intervened. Koraput sub collector, local MLA and Sunabeda DSP have lifted the border signboard from the new place and put it back in its original place. Koraput Assistant Collector Archana Dash visited the area and took stock of the situation and said joint verification of the border will be done. As many as 14 of the 30 districts in Odisha share borders with Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Jharkhand. (With agency Inputs)

The High Court will on Friday determine a bail application by freelance journalist Hopewell Chin'ono following a hearing on Wednesday.      The 47-year-old is accused of attempting to defeat the course of justice over Twitter comments critical about the National Prosecuting Authority.      Justice Tawanda Chitapi said he would deliver his judgement at 11.30AM on Friday after listening to arguments by the journalist's lawyers and the prosecution.      "I propose to write a full judgement. I need time to revise it," said Chitapi.      Chin'ono, who will stand trial in December in a separate case in which he is accused of inciting Zimbabweans to rise up against the government, was denied bail by Harare magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa who ruled he has a "propensity to commit similar offences".      The journalist's lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said the magistrate misdirected herself by coming to a conclusion that one pending matter amounts to "propensity" to commit crime.      "This is because it refers to a tendency to behave in a particular way. Once the word propensity is used, it cannot refer to one pending case, there has to be many," said Mtetwa.

After seeing the sexually-suggestive chats that Tongai Kambarami (26) exchanged with his wife only identified as Primrose (23), the husband hired two men and travelled all the way from South Africa to "deal" with Tongai.      Tongai told B-Metro that the husband used his wife's phone to pin him down.      "Primrose's husband pretended to be Prim and sent me sexually-suggestive messages and promised me that she is coming at the end of November. I hooked to the chats and had no reason to be suspicious," he said.      But Tongai never knew that he was being taken for a ride.      "On 10 November while I was at home relaxing, I received a message which I presumed was from Primrose saying she had sent me a parcel with a malayitsha and I should wait at home. They (malayitsha) arrived at 10pm and told me that they forgot the parcel in town so we have to drive to town to collect it. When we got to Emagetsini a guy told me that he was Primrose's husband and he was the one who had been communicating with me," he said.      Tongai said fear gripped him and he became numb. Primrose's husband and his partners in crime drove into a bushy area near Entumbane suburb.      "They were very angry and I thought they would kill me. I tried to talk to them so that they would not kill me and I gave them R500. They stripped me naked before tying my hands to the legs with a wire and leaving me in the bush," he said.      He said that he spent 10 hours in the bush.      "At around 8.30pm a Good Samaritan who was fetching firewood came to my rescue and went to inform a police officer at Entumbane Police Station. Police officers came and untied me," he said.      He was referred to Mpilo Central Hospital for medical examination. He was treated and has been discharged.      Bulawayo acting police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele confirmed the case and appealed for information that might lead to the arrest of the accused persons who are on the run.

Every day we’re making difficult decisions around what health services we’re able to provide. Are you prepared to not be able to get a health care service you need? There is a chance, that if we don’t change this trajectory, that you won’t get it.


  One of our toughest challenges is securing the staff we need. Many are fatigued by long hours and a long pandemic. Our people are our most important resource, and they are being pushed to the brink. Help us protect them, so they can be here when you need them.


  What more can we do? What more can we all do?


  We can start by putting aside our differences and working toward a common goal of defeating this virus.


  I really do believe that the majority of people are trying to do the right thing. Unfortunately, too many of us have let our guard down. And the fact is, some aren’t caring enough to do the right thing. The good news is that the best solutions are simple. Wear a mask, wash your hands, avoid gatherings. I know we’ve heard these a million times, but they work. But only if we all do this together.


  Our staff on the front lines of care are acting courageously, compassionately and resiliently. They care about you in the community. I am calling on our community to do the same for them.


  A little bit of sacrifice and support from you will make a huge difference for many. Please, during this time of year, think about what you can do to make a difference. I will give you a hint — wear your mask, wash your hands and avoid gatherings.


  We are going to get past this. However, in the meantime, we need your help.

As for the war, I must say again that Azerbaijani soldiers and officers showed true heroism. However, the number of deserters from the Armenian army exceeds 10,000 people. They are saying this themselves, their officials are saying that there were more than 10,000 deserters. This shows again what army is invincible and what army is a heroic army. Their army, in fact, that gang of their could only fight against civilians. The Khojaly executioners and other killers who burned our villages, killed our people and civilians cannot be considered servicemen. Their army consists of thieves. So many bent Armenian generals have been arrested in the last two years! The generals who sell soldiers' stew are thieves. Their "heroes" are cowards and their leaders are criminals. The Armenian leadership itself says that for 20 years, from 1998 to 2018, the country was governed by bandits, thieves, cowards and deserters. Who has led it for the last two and a half years? The whole world can sees that. So what name can one give to this country? Only one name - a failed state. What is the cause of this failure? Occupation! I have said this many times. Everyone can look up my speeches and interviews. I said that this occupation would lead Armenia to the abyss. I said that we would never come to terms with this occupation and return our lands sooner or later. But Armenia will waste a historic opportunity. Armenia has not been able to become an independent country for nearly 30 years. It is not independent today either. Armenia is in fact a colony. Was this the dream of the Armenian people? Was this their expectation? Why couldn't they become an independent country? Because of the occupation! What did they gain from the occupation? Nothing! They were disgraced in the political sphere, in all international organizations, we worked hard to disgrace them. Decisions and resolutions meeting our interests and based on international law were adopted. They were defeated on the battlefield and humiliated in front of the whole world. After that, they will have to live with this mark, with the mark of a "defeated country". They lived in Baku, Ganja, in all our cities and districts. Did they have any problems? No! They lost that. They had to leave here, having expelled our people and pursued a policy of ethnic cleansing. What did they gain? Nothing! And now, in this humiliated state, they are biting each other and destroying what little is left of their statehood. I told them to come to their senses and stop this occupation. As long as this occupation continues, Armenia will not be able to develop. Politically dependent, militarily dependent and economically incomplete. They have developed a very harmful ideological basis. Their ideology is based on lies, historical falsifications and the past. How can a country that cannot give up the falsified past move forward? Look how many wars there have been in the world. Take the last 100 years, 200 years. So many people have died in these wars. But who has lived with this enmity, who has lived with hatred in their hearts for years? Who has raised their children in the spirit of hatred? This is their future and this is their reality. The Soviet Union lost tens of millions of people during the war with Germany, but 10 or 20 years later, there was peace. The relations between Russia and Germany are now developing normally. European countries too. How many wars did France wage with Italy? How many wars did Germany and France wage? The people of what country, as they say, keep this hatred simmering in their hearts? This is what has brought Armenia to its current state. They themselves are guilty of all their troubles. On the other hand, how can a country that cannot establish normal relations with its neighbors develop? They are putting forward territorial claims against Turkey. They have no mind. It is suicidal to make territorial claims against a large country like Turkey.

Zimbabwe says it will introduce a bill in parliament establishing an independent complaints body to investigate public complaints against soldiers and police officers.      A constitution adopted in 2013 decreed the establishment of the body, but the government has dragged its feet.      The failure to enact the enabling legislation came into sharp focus in August 2018 when security forces killed six people and shot 35 others in post- election violence, and the January 2019 fuel price riots when at least two dozen people were killed and over 75 others shot. No troops or police officers have been charged over the killings, despite government assurances to investigate.      Following a meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday, information minister Monica Mutsvangwa said: "Cabinet noted that the complaints mechanism is to be intermediated by a body which is independent of each of the security services.      "Accordingly, the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission Bill establishes a commission to carry out this function with a view to remedying any harm caused by any misconduct on the part of any member of the security services.      "The commission would investigate complaints by members of the public against members of the security services and ensure that offending members are brought to account through recommendations for disciplinary action to be taken against them and appropriate remedies be granted to complainants.
