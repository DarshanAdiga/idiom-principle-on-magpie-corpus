For all the focus on the back-end of the defense, the real key to stopping the Dallas aerial attack might rest with the Browns pass rush. From a clean pocket, Prescott is completing 76 percent of his passes for 943 yards (8.9 yards per attempt), five touchdowns, zero interceptions and a quarterback rating of 117.8. When under pressure, however, Prescott becomes pedestrian, completing only 43 percent of his passes for 245 yards (6.6 yards per attempt), zero touchdowns, two interceptions and a quarterback rating of 43.2. His completion percentage and quarterback rating under pressure rank 25th and 29th in the NFL, respectively. It has to be noted that this pressure must come organically and not via the blitz. The front four has to get home because Prescott has shredded the blitz to the tune of 10 yards per attempt and a quarterback rating of 110.7 so far in 2020.

LONDON (AP) — As much of Britain’s economy emerged from coronavirus lockdown, its theaters stayed dark, with performers and staff unwillingly idled. So they made a song and dance about it. Scores of actors, technicians and theater staff marched through London’s West End to Parliament to the beat of showtunes Wednesday, asking the government for a plan to bring theaters back to life. The demonstrators were highlighting the prospect of a bleak Christmas season without the hundreds of pantomimes usually staged across the U.K. Pantos are as much a part of the British holiday season as turkey and presents, and a vital source of revenue for theaters.

“We had so much research available to us, and one of the things I drew on was just how much Gloria loved Bella,” the actor said in an interview. "You could see it in the research, the way she looked at her.

 Midler, too, was struck by the relationship between the two women.
 “There was so much respect there, so much respect and so much fun,” she said. "I think they had a great time together. I think they howled. And I wanted to make sure people knew that it wasn’t the kind of adversarial relationship that lots of people seem to have with Betty Friedan, although I worship Betty Friedan … but that wasn’t the case with Gloria and Bella. That was real love.”
 Taymor says her favorite moment between the two women happens in the offices of Ms. Magazine, which Steinem co-founded, and Abzug is explaining to the conflict-averse Steinem that she can't shy away from conflict with Friedan, the feminist leader and author.
 “The difference between them is that moment in the Ms. office where she says 'You can’t avoid conflict, and if you try to avoid conflict, conflict will seek you out.” And they were very different personalities. Gloria … didn’t want to have women fighting women.”
 “And Bella said sometimes we argue, sometimes we fight, sometimes we don’t get along. You know, she understood that women aren’t superwomen, but we’re after the same thing."
 Midler said she considered one of the achievements of Taymor's film to be that "You see them together planning, step by step and being in a room and actually making this movement from scratch.

In the first half of the year, Research and Development expenses decreased by 8% compared to the same period last year, to €1,939K.

Sales and Marketing expenses were also down 34% compared to the first half of 2019, at €545K. This decrease in business development efforts follows the effective signature of the contract with Nestlé Health Science. Finally, overheads expenses remained stable at €638K in S1 2020 compared to €642K in S1 2019. Overall, VALBIOTIS recorded a net loss of €2,931K.

So, while earlier Arab atrocities against the south could largely be seen as "merely" a modern extension of the fourteen century-old murderous clash between the Dar (realm) ul-Islam and the Dar al-Harb, the violence in Darfur (as with those in Arab-occupied Syrian and Iraqi Kurdistan, much of the rest of heavily non-Arab, Amazigh-"Berber"-North Africa, and elsewhere) have been mostly about Arab racism and chauvinism, pure and simple…being conducted by those very same folks who like to lecture the rest of the world about alleged "racist Zionism."

Prince Of Arran is all set for his third attempt to win the Melbourne Cup – and his new big-race jockey should be known this weekend.
 Charlie Fellowes confirmed his globetrotting stable star in perfect condition for the start of his latest adventure.
 Prince Of Arran, who has been in quarantine in preparation for his 10,000-mile outward journey, will leave in the small hours of Thursday morning.
 By the time he is safely settled again down under, the world may well know who is set to take over in the saddle too.
 Michael Walker – who rode Prince Of Arran to be third at Flemington two years ago and then second 12 months ago, promoted from third after interference ahead of him – decided two weeks ago to switch to Dashing Willoughby this time.
 On Wednesday, Fellowes said: “We are going to announce a jockey at the weekend.

Only one of the two seats on the Lancaster County Board of Commissioners up for election this year features a contested race.
 County Commissioner Roma Amundson, who holds the District 4 seat, is running unopposed for reelection.
 But the race for District 2, covering northwest Lancaster County, pits Commissioner Christa Yoakum, a Democrat appointed after Jennifer Brinkman vacated the seat for a job in the Lincoln Mayor's Office, against Republican challenger Eric Underwood.
 The five-person board manages county funds, oversees county property, adopts annual budgets, administering several programs established by state law, as well as sets tax levies and salaries of elected and appointed county officials.

In addition, a person who went to a bar at Birchwood, last month, may have been responsible for spreading COVID-19 to some 50 other individuals, including visitors from Minnesota who may have taken the disease back home with them, according to information shared Monday, Sept. 28, with the Barron County Board of Supervisors’ Health and Human Services Committee.
 County health workers are having a more difficult time getting people to quarantine after they’ve been diagnosed and/or exposed to COVID-19, the committee learned.
 County Health Officer Laura Sauve also told the committee that she is working with a high school in the county to, possibly, close classes and shift to distance learning only.
 Both Sauve and Tremblay said that the school involved is not Barron High School.
 An “active investigation” of a positive COVID-19 test was reported in early September at Pioneer Health & Rehab, Prairie Farm. See related story for information.
 As the Barron Area School District seeks legal guidance regarding the rumored positive test, Tremblay said the district’s school year is, otherwise, “going very smoothly, and I don’t see any future of ‘distance learning only’ situations coming our way. Our local DHS authorities, parents and Golden Bears have been wonderful to work with through this pandemic,” she added.
 Tremblay told the News-Shield “All I can say is that I PROMISE you we are following every (COVID-19) protocol for TRACING and then some, and we have a confidentiality agreement with DHS so when they report to us, we can’t report publicly out. Also, kids out (of school) doesn’t mean kids/staff with COVID, it more than likely is due to moderate risk tracing.”
 “We truly appreciate (health officers in) Barron and Dunn County,” Tremblay added. Part of the school district extends into Dunn County.

Golden Slipper victor Farnan, Sires Produce- Champagne Stakes winner King’s Legacy and JJ Atkins star Rothfire all resume in the 1200m feature alongside Group 1 placegetters Ole Kirk and Mamaragan as well as gun colt North Pacific.“Every now and then you get a really good crop of three-year-olds and this year is no exception,” Ryan said. “I go back through the years with some of my top horses and you see Hurricane Sky and he raced against Danzero and Brave Warrior and all that crop. “Then you look at Snitzel’s year there was Written Tycoon, Stratum and Trapeze Artist’s year was strong too.”Trapeze Artist won Ryan his first Golden Rose in 2017 in the same year his classy stablemate Menari won the Run To The Rose.Peltzer is also on a Golden Rose path and heads into Saturday’s $200,000 feature second-up.He was unbeaten at his first three starts before being beaten by Moir Stakes-bound sprinter Anders in the Group 3 San Domenico Stakes first-up.Anders was a runaway leader in the 1100m scamper but Ryan was happy with his charge, which made up good late ground when running on for second.“His first-up run was good and he has bounced through it well,” Ryan said.“If you watch all his runs he is good through the line and it was no different first-up.“It’s not as if he is getting to the bottom of it at the end of his race.“All I can say is that he has improved. I don’t know if that is two lengths or 10 lengths, no one knows until he runs again.” Peltzer will carry the bottom weight of 55kg against his three-year-old rivals on Saturday but Ryan doesn’t believe it will have any impact on his chances.“I don’t think it will make a lot of difference over the short course,” Ryan said.“It might make a difference when we get over 1600m and further but not over these sort of trips when it is only 3 kilos.”

The Indian media and entertainment (M&E) industry, which grew by 7.4 per cent in FY20, to reach a size of Rs 1.75 trillion, is expected to contract by a whopping 20 per cent in FY21, says KPMG in India’s Media and Entertainment report released today.


  Segments such as films have been impacted the most, notes the report aptly titled ‘A Year off Script: Time for Resilience’.


  However, in a year of dismal shows and de-growth, the digital and gaming segments have given a stand-out performance, growing at a rapid pace.


  It is only by FY 2022 that the media and entertainment industry will regain its mojo, says the report.


  However, for some segments, especially digital, there are silver linings. Thanks to changes wrought by Covid, the report projects that India’s digital ecosystem could reach a billion users earlier than the earlier projections.


  Advertising spends on digital is set to overtake spends on TV by FY21 itself. In FY20, television was the largest segment in terms of both overall revenues as well as advertisement revenues, with a 9 per cent growth overall. However, the New Tariff Order (NTO) was responsible for some part of this growth as subscription revenues for TV channels grew on the back of this.


  According to Girish Menon, Partner and Head, Media and Entertainment, KPMG, the third quarter (October to December) of this year may see a bounce-back to pre-Covid levels for television and print, which may attain the same revenues of FY20 third quarter.


  But before rejoicing, a point to note is that this quarter includes the IPL as well as the festive season. IPL has in the past been responsible for pulling in 30 per cent of the ad revenues in a year, so in a sense this shows that advertisers are still holding back.

NEW YORK - A wealthy benefactor of Keith Raniere, the disgraced leader of a self-improvement group in upstate New York convicted of turning women into sex slaves who were branded with his initials, faces sentencing Wednesday in the federal conspiracy case.


  Seagram’s liquor fortune heir Clare Bronfman is due to appear in federal court in Brooklyn. The stakes are high. Her lawyers want a judge to give her three years' probation instead of prison time, while prosecutors say she deserves five years behind bars.


  Bronfman, 41, admitted in a guilty plea last year that she harboured someone who was living in the U.S. illegally for unpaid “labour and services” and that she committed credit card fraud on behalf of Raniere, leader of the group called NXIVM.

The Centre has initiated an anti-dumping probe against imports of copper tubes and pipes from ASEAN members — Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam — into India. This has kindled hopes of a demand revival for domestic manufacturers of copper tubes. The industry has seen capacity utilisation dwindle to a low of about 18 per cent in the past four-five years.


  As against the total annual demand of about 85,000 tonnes for copper tubes and pipes and installed capacity of about 82,000 tonnes, imports are to the tune of about 69,000 tonnes — leaving over 80 per cent of the domestic capacities idle.


  Talking to _BusinessLine_ , Sandeep Jain, President, Bombay Metal Exchange (BME) said that of the 69,000 tonnes of total imports of these products, about 63,000 tonnes or approximately 74 per cent of the total demand was met through imports from ASEAN nations.


  “In the last five years, 20 large manufacturers of copper tubes have shut operations as they couldn’t withstand the competition from cheap imports. They had about 70 per cent of the industry’s total capacity,” said Jain.


  The duty difference between the raw material and finished products is about 5.5 per cent, which makes finished products’ imports cheaper to that extent compared to domestically manufactured products, added Jain.


  The BME, a representative body of non-ferrous metals trade and industry in India, was the one that had appealed to the Directorate General of Trade Remedies under Ministry of Commerce and Industry for the probe.


  ## Targeted production


  Data shows that during the past four years, imports from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam collectively accounted for more than 90 per cent of total imports of copper pipe and tubes, broadly categorised under HS Codes 74112100, 74112200 and 74112900. These products are largely used in air-conditioning and refrigeration systems. It is seen that these countries have encouraged local production despite no additional demand in their domestic markets. This indicates that the production was targeted to feed the Indian market and gain benefit, say industry sources.


  Following the government probe, Jain stated that prices may go up in the domestic markets. “There is a possibility of an anti-dumping duty on imports of finished products. But there is also a possibility that the government may cut duty on raw materials. If that happens, then the prices will remain at par with the imported rates,” he said.

 He was found guilty in December of 37 charges relating to 11 victims, aged between 11 and 71, and was described by the sentencing judge, Mr Justice Edis, as a “classic psychopath”.
 Sinaga – the UK’s most prolific serial rapist – preyed on lone, drunk young men around nightclubs near his flat in Manchester, posing as a Good Samaritan who offered them a floor to sleep on or promised them more drink.
 The Indonesian student drugged the men then filmed himself sexually violating them while they were unconscious, with many of his victims having little or no memory of the assaults.
 Judge Suzanne Goddard QC, who sentenced him to a minimum of 30 years, described Sinaga as “an evil serial sexual predator” and a “monster”.

Kathryn DePalo-Gould, a Florida International University political science professor, said the gap might also reflect Trump supporters' willingness to risk voting in person during the pandemic while Democrats prefer taking precautions.
 “Trump really won Florida (in 2016) largely based on the voters who showed up on Election Day,” she said, adding that could happen again.
 Democrat Kate Lang Bass, a Boynton Beach cost estimator for a window company, normally walks to the polls and loves getting the “I Voted” sticker, but she requested a mail-in ballot after the state’s March primary. She didn’t feel her polling place took enough precautions to protect voters from the virus.
 She plans to deposit her mail-in ballot early at the Palm Beach County elections office to assure it doesn’t get lost.
 ”I’ve been a big Joe Biden fan since I was 13 and he ran in 1988,” Bass said. She was disappointed when he didn’t get nominated that year or in 2008, but “now he is running and I am so very excited.”
 Groups such as The Voter Participation Center, which says its goal is to increase participation by groups underrepresented at the polls, are boosting the surge in Democratic mail-in requests. The nonpartisan organization sent vote-by-mail applications to 4 million Floridians, garnering 720,000 requests.

  We decided to use son-in-law Lloyd’s horse. A big, big thing, but he is safe. Lloyd got him harnessed up for me. I am wondering if I could get the harness on him. He is so big, and he has these big feet that make such loud clops. I figured everyone could hear us going.


  I just may decide to use him some more. It was relaxing knowing he wasn’t going to do something stupid.

 The European Commission's new migration pact prescribes that if expulsion does not succeed in eight months, the member state responsible for the expulsion of the migrant will have to receive them on its territory, effectively completing the process of accepting a quota migrant, MEP Jaak Madison writes.
 The European Commission unveiled its new migration pact last Wednesday the coverage of which in the media has been superficial at best and centered around amplifying the Commission's slogans.
 It has long been said that there will not be new mandatory migration quotas and the ordinary person led to believe that borders will be strengthened and illegal migrants expelled. If countries have been unable to manage it so far, why should things be different now?
 European institutions are controlled by the left and one of the authors of the new pact, Internal Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson really believes that "immigration will cause our continent to blossom." She describes migration from third countries as beneficial and necessary.
 Common sense would suggest that Johansson is not going against her convictions, which is also evident in the pact that is riddled with clever little clauses.
 The devil is in the details and the mandatory solidarity mechanism the elephant in the room in this case. It gives member states the choice of whether to accept immigrants or sponsor returning them. If the so-called solidarity forum finds the member state's measures unsuitable or insufficient, they can still theoretically enforce quotas.
 How many countries would decide to allow migrants? If all countries only tried to demonstrate mandatory solidarity by sending migrants back, pressure on border countries would not be relieved to any notable degree.
 Someone will have to allow migrants entry, while even member states that would normally be willing to accept them, such as Germany and Sweden, are wary of losing votes to the right these days. In the end, we might even see these "solidarity states" refuse to accept enough migrants, leaving Europe at an impasse again.
 If we were to choose the return mechanism, the illegal migrants to be expelled might still end up in Estonia. The migration pact prescribes that if expulsion does not succeed in eight months (four months during a crisis), the member state responsible for the expulsion of the migrant will have to receive them on its territory, effectively completing the process of accepting a quota migrant.
 Expulsion fails very often because a migrant cannot be returned to a country where their well-being might be in danger or if the country of origin refuses to cooperate. You can imagine there are quite a few such countries in Africa.
 According to the Migration Pact, cooperation with countries of origin would be influenced using visas. Those that refuse to coordinate will be denied European visas, while those that do will have them. This would in turn work to legalize and add to migration from third countries through work, study and residence visas.
 The pact at hand will pass through several rounds of debates and compromises before it is finished and could change in time. Even the left is criticizing the pact for not achieving enough, looking to add tougher conditions. Time will tell what will happen. Until then, we wish Europeans health and a cool head.

Arsenal is close to selling Sead Kolasinac this summer after he fell down the pecking order at the Emirates.


  The Bosnian has been struggling to find a place in Mikel Arteta’s team since the Spaniard was named Arsenal’s latest manager.


  The Gunners have been very busy in this transfer window landing the likes of Willian and Gabriel Magalhaes.


  They need to offload some of their current players too and their defence is a position that they have so many players.


  Kolasinac has been used as a left centre-back by Arteta in his back-three when Kieran Tierney hasn’t been available.


  But the Gunners have natural left centre-backs now and he will likely not be of use to them again as he was before.


  He has been linked with a move to the likes of Schalke 04 and West Ham before now, but it seems that Bayer Leverkusen has won the race for his signature.


  Transfer guru, Fabrizio Romano claims that he will join the German side for 11m euros within the next two days.


  He Tweeted: “The deal for Sead Kolasinac to Bayer Leverkusen will be completed on next 48 hours. €11m + add ons to Arsenal, confirmed.


  #AFC want a permanent deal also for Lucas Torreira to Atlético Madrid. Meeting tomorrow too between intermediary and Atléti.”

Two notorious rapists who committed “some of the worst and most violent” sexual offences in English legal history may die behind bars if they are given whole life tariffs at a Court of Appeal hearing next month.
 Joseph McCann, 35, was given 33 life sentences at the Old Bailey in December for a string of horrific sex attacks on 11 women and children during a 15-day cocaine and vodka-fuelled rampage.
 Reynhard Sinaga, 37, was also sentenced to life in January at Manchester Crown Court for a total of 159 offences, including 136 counts of rape, committed against 48 men – although police have linked him to more than 190 potential victims.
 The Attorney General’s Office has referred the 30-year minimum jail terms handed to McCann and Sinaga to the Court of Appeal as “unduly lenient” and will argue they should each have received a whole life tariff instead.
 A spokeswoman for the judiciary confirmed on Tuesday that the challenges to McCann and Sinaga’s sentences, which were originally due to take place in March but were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, would be heard over two days on October 14-15.
 Solicitor general Michael Ellis QC will argue at the hearing that McCann and Sinaga should both have been given a whole life tariff for a litany of sexual offences, which are “some of the worst and most violent that this country has ever witnessed”.
 The hearing, which will test whether a whole life order can be imposed in non- homicide cases, will also be the first time two separate offenders’ sentences have been challenged together as being unduly lenient.

"Early this morning, Azerbaijani armed forces launched an air-to-surface missile strike along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh, targeting peaceful settlements and residents, including the capital Stepanakert. This is a continuation of military aggression against the northern border of Armenia which started in July of 2020, when Azerbaijani authorities threatened to fine a rocket at the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant near Yerevan, Armenia. This morning's attack once again shows Azerbaijan's blatant disregard of international law. The recent actions of Turkey's President and Defense Minister in referring to Azeri soldiers as martyrs, speaking in religious and nationalist terms about the support Ankara could give and warning Armenia not to "play with fire" are troublesome. I strongly condemn Azerbaijan's aggression towards Armenians and its repeated escalation of hostilities against Nagorno Karabakh."

The cafe owner is one of thousands of small business owners across Australia who at the end of September will resume paying back loans that were put on ice due to the economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. However, one problem remains for Mr Barbaro and his brothers who run seven CBD cafes – no one is coming into the city. Mr Barbaro said even with restrictions easing, the bulk of his revenue comes from white-collar workers who fill Sydney’s corporate towers, which at the moment lie empty. “The biggest fear right now is not being able to return to normal and being unable to afford it,” he said. “These big corporates are staying home … we are doing it at cost at the moment.” Since the onset of the pandemic, Mr Barbaro has been forced to place all his existing business loans on hold while also applying for an additional $250,000 coronavirus support loan. The financial uncertainty has also pushed him into deferring his mortgage repayments on his Lilyfield family home. He is the father of two young children and the primary income earner for his household. “If I don’t make my normal wage I won’t be able to afford my mortgage,” he said. “It’s a very big worry. I don’t want to lose the house where my kids live.” Mr Barbaro’s home loan is with St George, part of the Westpac group. He said the bank had not contacted him about whether he would be able to extend the repayment holiday beyond the end of September. The Australian Banking Association has confirmed a further four- month deferral may be granted on request. Banks are also able to move home loans to interest-only payments. RateCity research director Sally Tindall said mortgage holders should consider all options before deferring their loan, as a six-month extension could cost thousands of dollars more in the long run. “Your mortgage repayments might be on hold but the interest is still accumulating in the background,” she said. The end of the deferral period has also caused growing concern a significant number of homeowners could potentially default on their mortgages, resulting in an influx of properties being listed on the market. On September 4, ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott said Australia’s housing market was expected to fall between 10 to 15 per cent because of the COVID-19 recession. My Housing Market economist Dr Andrew Wilson said the investor home market was under the most financial stress, as landlords were finding it hard to deal with a lower demand for tenants, which is pushing down rental prices. Dr Wilson said this added pressure could prompt property investors to sell after repayment deferral periods end. “There is some stress in inner suburban apartment markets in Melbourne and Sydney,” he said. “We are currently experiencing record levels of vacancies.”

Moroney won the 2000 Melbourne Cup with Brew and Aktau is a $41 chance to give the New Zealand-born trainer another win in Australia’s greatest race.Aktau suffered one defeat from four starts in his maiden Australian campaign, which culminated with a win in the Listed Mornington Cup in March.The Mornington Cup success gave Aktau a berth in next month’s Caulfield Cup field and Moroney said he wanted to qualify Aktau for the Melbourne Cup with a top-three finish in the Caulfield Cup.Aktau only has 51kg in both races, which left the six-year-old 67th in line for a Melbourne Cup start at Tuesday’s release of weights.“I think there’s some work to do to get him there (to the Melbourne Cup) but it depends on what’s coming out (from overseas) and attrition,” the Flemington-based Moroney said.“We always thought that his best way of qualifying for the Melbourne Cup would be the Caulfield Cup. Moroney wants the Caulfield Cup to be Aktau’s third run this time in, meaning the son of Teofilo was fit enough to be competitive in his first-up assignment in Saturday’s Winning Edge Presentation Stakes (1700m).“He’s had two jumpouts and he’s forward enough for Saturday’s race,” Moroney said.“He doesn’t need a lot of racing because he’s a natural stayer.“He keeps himself pretty fit because he’s a horse that when he steps out on the track, he works himself pretty hard.”Moroney was surprised by the strength of Aktau’s opposition in Saturday’s $125,000 race. Group 1 Schweppes Oaks winner Toffee Tongue is among the acceptors as is the highly touted import Django Freeman.Aktau is a $5 favourite to make a winning start to his spring preparation with Jye McNeil in the saddle at Flemington.

Doch danach geht es innerhalb von fünf Tagen nach Tel Aviv und Istanbul, beides vom Auswärtigen Amt eingestufte Risikogebiete, und dann weiter nach Weißenfels zum BBL-Pokal gegen medi Bayreuth. Ob das mit Flügen und Coronatests wirklich alles klappt, steht in den Sternen. "Als Organisation sind wir aber bereit, uns jeglicher Situation zu stellen", sagte Bayern- Sportdirektor Daniele Baiesi.
 Auch bei Alba stellen sie sich den außergewöhnlichen Umständen, gehen aber mit großem Respekt in die kommenden Wochen und Monate. "Das wird mit Abstand die größte Herausforderung, der wir gegenüberstanden. Man kann zurzeit gar nichts planen", sagte Alba-Manager Marco Baldi.
 Die Corona-Pandemie verhindert eine solide Saisonplanung. "Das ist sehr zermürbend. Man ist gewohnt Dinge vorausschauend zu planen, aber das ist im Moment schlichtweg nicht möglich", sagte der erfahrene Funktionär. Der Manager setzt deshalb auf Flexibilität. "Man muss sich auf viele Szenarien vorbereiten", sagte er. Denn Verordnungen und Regeln können sich täglich ändern. Auch mit möglichen Quarantänen nach Reisen ist zu rechnen. So sieht Kapitän Niels Giffey die Reise nach Tel Aviv - wo gerade ein Lockdown herrscht ­ skeptisch. "Das ist schon verrückt, dass wir zu diesem Zeitpunkt dahin müssen. Das hätte besser laufen können."
 Auch welche Kosten auf die Clubs zu kommen ist noch unklar. Für den Flug ins Corona-Risikogebiet Israel musste extra ein Flieger gechartert werden. "Das sind natürlich Zusatzkosten und wir wissen nicht, wie oft das diese Saison noch passiert", erklärte Baldi. Und dann ist da noch die Frage nach Zuschauern bei den Heimspiel. Aktuell gehen beide Clubs davon aus, dass zumindest einige Fans in die jeweiligen Hallen dürfen. Aber auch das kann sich zum Teil noch am Vorabend eine Partie ändern.
 Auch die Verantwortlichen der Euroleague wissen um die bevorstehenden Risiken und Herausforderungen. Nachdem schon die vergangene Saison wegen Corona ohne Champion abgebrochen werden musste, sind die finanziellen Zwänge für die Bosse um den Spanier Jordi Bertomeu aber groß. "Wir haben einen Plan B, aber wir ziehen unseren Plan A vor", hieß es aus der Liga-Zentrale in Barcelona.

Just as importantly, when you move the safety once, or press the trigger, when you do it again later they feel the same.
