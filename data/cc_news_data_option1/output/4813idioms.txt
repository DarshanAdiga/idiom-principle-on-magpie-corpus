Writer-director-producer Alan Ball has never been one to shy away from trying to make people laugh or make them grimace or shudder or think or get caught up in emotional chaos. He also has great command of dialogue. For TV, he created and wrote "Six Feet Under" and "True Blood." His film writing credits include "Towelhead" and "American Beauty" (for which he won an Oscar).      With "Uncle Frank," he's conjured up all sorts of ways to have his characters and their story affect viewers, and he scores on just about every one of them. The film is being plugged as a coming of age story, but taken the way most people think of that term, it's an inaccurate description. Yes, the protagonist is 18-year-old Beth (Sophia Lillis), who has gotten away from the grip of her "proper" South Carolina family and headed to college in 1973 New York, where she can start exploring life - start "coming of age." But there's a second principal protagonist, Beth's Uncle Frank (Paul Bettany), a 46-year- old gay college professor who is trapped in a secretive way of life due to family-related events from his teen years. Frank is an adult who is still struggling to get past all of that and finally come of age.      Bookended by busy family gatherings at the big old Southern house - the opening one is for a birthday, the closing one is for a funeral - "Uncle Frank" tells many stories. The main ones are about the relationship between Beth and Frank ("Nobody else in my family ever seemed interested in me," she says in a voice-over), and the one between Frank and his partner Wally (Peter Macdissi), a happy, caring and loving man who managed to escape homosexual persecution in his native Saudi Arabia. To a lesser degree, but of equal importance, are glimpses of and bits of insight on different members of Beth's family: well-meaning but backward thinking younger brother Mike (Steve Zahn), sensitive mom (Margo Martindale), short-tempered homophobe dad (Stephen Root), and others.      Featuring both stern and shocking revelations as well as sparklingly funny scenes, Ball's script has conversations that allow some characters to understand how others tick. It shifts into road trip mode when Frank's complicated father dies and he must head back to South Carolina - and the family that doesn't know his secret (don't worry, he has company). And it unwaveringly delivers the message that you need to be who you are, no matter what anyone else thinks.      It's hard to pick out a "best performance" in the film. Sophia Lillis ("It") plays Beth with a wide-eyed curiosity and sense of adventure. Within the wonderful couple of Frank and Wally, Paul Bettany's Frank blends feelings of being relaxed and in turmoil, and Peter Macdissi's Wally is sweet and supportive, but also suggests, in a moment of seriousness, that there was once a line between him and Frank that must never again be crossed. In an unfortunately short amount of screen time, Stephen Root, as Daddy Mac, once again masterfully displays why he's such an in-demand character actor.      Any lightness in the film is obliterated by long-ago thoughts in Frank's head that are now brought to the fore by his return to the family home, and some of those scenes, presented in flashback, are traumatic to watch. As are some of the goings-on in the house, especially during the reading of Daddy Mac's will, where the film's dramatic impact approaches being overwhelming.      But Ball's skill with words and storyline and direction, and his ability to balance all of that into a thoughtful, poignant, searing, and unconventional story, make "Uncle Frank" a real treat, recommended to everyone with an open mind.      "Uncle Frank" premieres on Amazon Prime on Nov. 25.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

"We're grateful that people have a heart to help," Wilhemy said.
 As the holiday season approaches, Pottstown Cluster is "more prepared for what's happening," Wilhemy said.
 The organization will offer its annual holiday donation box this year. It doesn't offer a box for Thanksgiving, only Christmas. The sign-up is entirely online, and 200 families will get boxes with a main course like a turkey, ham or chicken as well as sides and desserts, Jones said.
 Pottstown Cluster also does a Christmas toy program for children, and that looks different this year, too. Jones said instead of setting up a "toy shop" where parents in need can come in and select toys for their children, this year parents sign up online and write down three or four things their children like. Volunteers will then select toys for each child and package them for a pick-up at the door.
 Major Jeny Shurtleff, head of the food pantry at The Salvation Army of Pottstown, said the organization couldn't allow people into the building from March to July, so all meals had to switch to take-out. People are now allowed into the building to get their food, but they can't stay to eat it for safety reasons.
 Shurtleff said the Salvation Army offers a soup kitchen lunch every Wednesday, and a food pantry on Thursday. Since September, Shurtleff said she tries to make every soup kitchen lunch a hot meal as opposed to a cold sandwich.
 "The numbers went up and stayed up since March," Shurtleff said. The soup kitchen lunch attendance increased from around 50 people to around 70 people every week.
 With limited volunteers, Shurtleff said "it's very stressful" to prepare the Wednesday meals. The current staff includes just Shurtleff and three volunteers to prep the food, distribute it and clean up.
 In March, The Salvation Army food pantry switched from a choice pantry, where people could select what foods they wanted, to a pre-packaged food box. People are still allowed to decide on fresh elements, like fruit, vegetables and pastries, but the canned goods are already selected.
 For Thanksgiving, The Salvation Army is handing out boxes donated by Helping Harvest in Reading; each box contains a turkey, sides, and a pumpkin pie. So far, Shurtleff said the organization has given out boxes to 147 families.
 The Salvation Army's Christmas campaign starts on Dec. 16. Helping Harvest will again provide boxes for Shurtleff to give out to families, this time with ham instead of turkey and pecan pie instead of pumpkin.
 Shurtleff said there are also toy signups for kids aged 10 and under; parents can come in at an assigned time and get a pre-packed box of toys for their children. The list fills up fast, but Shurtleff said she always tries to get toys for every child.
 "I never want to send anyone away," Shurtleff said. "We do our best because we want to make sure kids have something for Christmas."

But the LAO predicts budget shortfalls beginning in 2021 as revenues grow at a piddling 1 percent, with deficits likely to reach $17 billion by fiscal year 2024-25.

NEW YORK (CNN) - The coronavirus pandemic has devastated the hotel industry in the U.S.Many properties remain closed, and thousands of people that worked in hospitality are unemployed. With the holidays approaching, the impact is even more painful.Jesus Morales looks forward to the bustle of the holidays at Chicago’s historic Drake Hotel. Customer demands and long hours are tiring – but financially rewarding.“Last year I was making good money. But it’s gone. I don’t know when I’m going back to work,” Morales said.This year, there’s no holiday bonus. He’s worked here for 33 years but was furloughed in March.The Drake is one of Chicago’s top hotels, where highly-trained employees serve an elite clientele. But this year, there are very few of both.“My savings is gone. My under the pillow money is gone.” Morales said.The hotel industry has lost more than 650,000 jobs during the pandemic, with 4 in 10 hotel workers like Morales, still out of work.These last few months have been taxing – emotionally and financially. His daughter is recovering from an accident, and his wife needs daily medication.“I don’t have health insurance right now. My insurance ran out like a month ago. To get my insurance, it cost about $1,200 a month, and there’s just no way I can pay that,” he said.In New York, iconic hotels are shutting their doors. The Plaza is temporarily closed, the Roosevelt permanently, and the Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel is running at 15% occupancy, while sister hotel is shuttered.“It’s very eerie. It is costing a lot of money to stay closed, and every month it’s just drain, drain drain. Its just in your blood. As a hotelier, you never close your front door,” said John Fitzpatrick, owner of Fitzpatrick Hotels North America.Just 25 of Fitzpatrick’s 175 employees are working.Bilal Yayla was recently called back to tend the bar, but he says without tips, his income has dropped by more than 50%.“I was out of work for, uh, almost three months also,” he said. “We lost our insurance, and I have had two babies at home.”In Miami, Jenny Brody has won awards as an elite concierge at the St. Regis Bal Harbor, but she and her husband were both furloughed from their hotel jobs in March.He found a temporary job in October. She’s still looking.“You just kind of go into panic mode, like, ‘Did we save enough for this rainy day?’ so to speak, but really 2020 is becoming ... a rainy year,” Brody said.At the end of this year, dozens of federal protections for those out of work expire. For millions of americans like Morales, it is not the new year he was expecting.“Since I was 17 I have been working at least two jobs until now, so I’ve been paying taxes for 46 years. You are trying to be the best citizen of the United States that you can, and it’s just frustrating that the government isn’t doing much for the hard-working people,” he said.Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.

A couple married 50 years died together Monday when a tractor- trailer hit head on the SUV they were in on Interstate 55 in Jefferson County, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. Authorities identified them as Leonard Wayne Byrd, 72, and Rebecca Joyce Byrd, 66, both of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The couple died at the scene of the five-vehicle crash, which occurred when tractor-trailer rear-ended a vehicle then plowed through a cable barrier and went into incoming traffic. The chain- reaction crashes began when a northbound 2015 Chevrolet Cruze was traveling slower than the speed limit. The truck driver applied the brakes but still hit the back of the Cruze, which ran off the interstate and overturned. The truck then struck the side of a northbound 2013 Acura TL. The truck, a 1993 Western Star, crashed through the cable barrier, veered into the southbound lanes and hit the 2020 Kia Telluride that Rebecca Byrd was driving. The cable barrier hit a southbound 2015 Nissan Altima. The Byrds were returning home from a trip to Minnesota to visit a relative, said their granddaughter, Brittany Byrd of Farmington, Missouri. “I’m glad they were together,” she said. “They’ve been together all along and they went together.”

Land banks are emerging as an important resource to help fill the affordable housing shortage communities are facing in West Michigan and across the state. Michigan’s first land bank was started in 2004 in Genesee County with the goal of reverting tax-foreclosed properties to productive use. Of Michigan’s 83 counties, 46 now have land banks with similar missions. The state also operates a land bank for the 37 counties, including Kent County, without a land bank authority. Over the last few years, community leaders and housing advocates have realized the opportunities for affordable housing projects on land bank-owned properties, said Housing Next Executive Director Ryan Kilpatrick. Land banks are beneficial for facilitating affordable housing projects because they are a public entity with a primary goal of serving the community and not maximizing profit, Kilpatrick said. “One of the things that’s great about land banks is we can be pretty flexible,” said Calhoun County Land Bank Authority Executive Director Krista Trout-Edwards. “We do consider things outside of the highest bid.” A housing project is less likely to be affordable if the development is left to the private sector, Kilpatrick said. The high demand for affordable housing also can’t be met solely by the private sector alone, especially with high construction costs, he added. “In a lot of ways I think we’re still figuring out this tool which has now been around for 10 years, but it has really transitioned from a model of blight elimination to a model of equitable development in the last three to four years as we’ve really begun to acknowledge the rate of development in our core urban areas,” Kilpatrick said. Acting as developer A recent Housing Next study shows Grand Rapids needs at least 5,340 more rental units and 3,548 more owner-occupied units in the next five years to meet housing demand. Housing North, a nonprofit that spans 10 counties in the northwestern Lower Peninsula, showed last year the region would need about 15,000 housing units in the next five years, mostly in rental units. “The idea of land banks a decade ago was to address the immediate health and safety concerns of removing dangerous buildings and having an entity that could have and hold these properties,” said Kalamazoo County Land Bank Executive Director Kelly Clarke. “A decade in, there is an affordable housing crisis in Kalamazoo and across the state and country.” Kalamazoo County’s land bank has served as the developer for several affordable housing projects, Clarke said. Most recently, the land bank was the developer of 24 units of senior housing in the county, and is engaged in redeveloping a number of existing structures throughout the city. “That role has allowed us to engage in efforts that align with our values, which is to ensure residents near properties both influence and benefit from redevelopment,” Clarke said. “We typically include a process at the beginning of our projects that allows the community to come up with a vision for what they want to see in the redevelopment.” Residents have regularly articulated a strong desire to see more mixed income and affordable housing projects, Clarke said. “When we have reached out to the community during the strategic planning process we’ve heard people say they want us to stay engaged in transformational projects, and in a limited capacity we’re able to do that,” Clarke said. “It doesn’t always make sense for us to be the developer — we typically limit ourselves to one project at a time.” Overcoming challenges The biggest challenge to building affordable housing continues to be resources and funding, Clarke said. Land banks can help offset some of these costs in some cases because the 2004 state law allowing for the authorities provides counties with a toolbox to address vacant and defunct land. Sometimes simply making available land known to the wider community so nonprofits and developers know about it is enough to kick off an affordable housing project, Clarke said. Funding tools such as brownfield financing can be used when parcels are under the ownership of a land bank authority, which can fund remediation and site cleanup costs to prepare a site for development. In Calhoun County, the land bank authority played a role in working with the city and helped advocate for changes in local ordinances to allow for more density downtown, said Trout-Edwards. “We were able to show what could happen on our existing properties there,” Trout-Edwards said. For the Ingham County Land Bank, the goal is always to sell a property for an affordable home or development if possible, said Director Roxanne Case. “When we use grant funds, we do request that those properties are sold as affordable housing,” Case said. “When we complete developments, we request, encourage and push the developer to sell or lease some of their units as affordable housing.” The numbers do not always work for developers to do that, but it is always the goal and what the land bank advocates for, Case added. “We’re constantly trying to figure out a different avenue to help any developer achieve that,” Case said. Covering the state capital also makes the Ingham County Land Bank unique, Case said. “Because of that, I feel like we strive for better housing because it is the capital city, so we try and use that to our advantage because politics do come into play,” Case said. “We try to use that to our advantage as much as we can. We have a really good partnership with the city of Lansing, which I believe makes us more effective.” Leveraging funding tools to create more affordable housing is also a goal for the Michigan State Land Bank Authority. Creating more affordable and workforce housing is “a priority and need for communities all over the state,” said state land bank Executive Director Emily Doerr. “Construction costs have gone way up, but we still need to build affordable and workforce housing in Michigan, so we need all the tools we have on the table so that way a developer can partner with us and other statewide agencies for funding tools,” Doerr said.

 Dear Dave,
 My husband and I usually have a few disagreements around the holidays when it comes to Christmas spending. Do you have any advice for eliminating this kind of thing, and making the financial side of Christmas a little less stressful?
  _Kellie_
 Dear Kellie,
 I imagine every couple has a few disagreements over Christmas spending. The trick is in how you handle them, and come to a compromise you each feel is fair, smart and affordable.
 One of the keys is to start talking before you start shopping. Being on the same page - and creating a plan and sticking to it - are great ways to bring peace and togetherness into the picture. Honestly, Christmas spending can be part of your monthly cash flow plan the whole year. Get the picture? I'm talking about living on a written, monthly budget. You know Christmas is Dec. 25 every single year, so why not set aside a little each month leading up to the holidays?
 If you haven't planned ahead, now is a great time to become a unified team. Huddle up, not only to talk about Christmas priorities, but devise a game plan moving forward so that this doesn't happen again next year. Together, figure all your regular monthly income and expenses into a budget. If you've saved anything at all for Christmas, include that as well. We've all got necessities, so take off those first. Then, make a general list of everything you'd like to spend money on for Christmas - I'm talking about the things we often overlook like food, cards, party expenses and decorations. Now, make a gift list. Write a dollar amount beside each name or expense on your lists, and if the grand total is the same as - or less than - your Christmas budget total, you're ready to roll!
 If you can't agree, or the numbers don't work, run through things again. This doesn't mean to repeat your positions until you get what you want. It means both of you acting like mature, responsible adults; finding some middle ground; and making sacrifices. If you really want to show your commitment, you and your spouse can sign your new budget. Signing your name is a simple, psychological signal that means you're committed to your agreement. Then, post it somewhere you'll both see it regularly.
 Give it a try, Kellie. It just might help reinforce your commitment to the budget - and each other - when the shopping frenzy sets in!

The smooth, tall structure was found during a helicopter survey of bighorn sheep in southeastern Utah, officials said Monday. State workers from the Utah Department of Public Safety and Division of Wildlife Resources spotted the gleaming object from the air and landed nearby to check it out. The exact location is so remote that officials are not revealing it publicly, worried that people might get lost or stranded trying to find it and need to be rescued.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (AP) — A prominent Black Kentucky artist whose painted memories of rural life in Kentucky are featured in U.S. and European museums and in the collections of well-known personalities including Oprah Winfrey, has died. Helen LaFrance was 101 years old.LaFrance died in Mayfield on Sunday, according to Brown Funeral Home.LaFrance was self-taught, and her works show people at church, family gatherings, funerals and other aspects of small-town life in western Kentucky.One of her first known public works is a mural in the St. James AME Church in Mayfield, completed in 1947. LaFrance also has worked in wood carving and quilting.“Mom used to hold my hand and help me to draw things,” LaFrance said in a news release celebrating her 100th birthday last year.Her first work was a large gray rabbit painted in watercolors on the back of a piece of wallpaper, according to a bio on the website of the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights.Later in life, LaFrance worked in a hospital, tobacco barns and a ceramic factory, where she decorated whiskey bottles. Still, she did not begin painting her well-known “memory paintings” full time until 1986, when she was in her late 60s. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

All summer I averaged about four 5Ks per week — blisteringly _slow_ 5Ks, and my running pace arrow was perpetually pointed down. It advised me to “pick up the pace!,” which haha, no. I easily faint in heat and I was not going to risk that for the sake of an arrow. Experienced runners know the value of slow runs, and at the end of the day, consistently running in a safe way is more important. I knew this. I told myself this every time I stared at that stupid fucking arrow. Didn’t stop me from feeling frustrated every time I saw it.

MULLINVILLE -- The Old School Antique Mall in Mullinville has been around for six years, with Susan Clayton at the helm since November 2018. Doris Headrick and a group of her friends started the antique mall in 2014 after recognizing they had a special affinity for not only the antiques they collected, but also the building which houses their shop, an unused schoolhouse in the small, western-Kansas town.
   
 The Old School Antique Mall, located in the old high school building, is not used anymore as K-12 students from Mullinville attend consolidated Kiowa County Schools in Greensburg. The antique mall spans three rooms formerly used for economics, science and music classes. Headrick said people come through the building and say "I used to cook here" or "I used to go to band in this room." It's a place with many good memories for a lot of their visitors.
   
 "I think having the mall in our old high school is very important to our community," said Clayton. "It's so much better for the building to be occupied than just sitting empty."
   
 Mall vendors are able to arrange their items in a rented space. They are responsible for pricing and displaying their items, but do not have to be there when the store is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Clayton teaches at Haviland Grade School during the week, which limits her availability.
   
 "My vendors are amazing and provide so many unusual, unique and interesting items," Clayton said. "I have been exposed to so many beautiful and intriguing items here. It's my favorite place to shop!"
   
 Some of her favorite items that come through are milk bottles, milk cans, and ice cream tins from Gardiner's Dairy in Garden City.
   
 "My great-grandfather acquired this dairy in the 1920s from his brother, and it remained a family business until 1972," said Clayton. "My first job was working in the dairy's office in the 1960s, so to purchase these items, from various vendors now, is very special to me."
   
 Clayton and her late husband taught junior high classes in the school-turned- antique-mall building. Her current husband's grandfather used his team of horses to slope the floor in the auditorium. Her mother-in-law graduated there in the late 40s from Mullinville High School.
   
 The building will be 100-years-old in 2025. Clayton said she is thankful for the dedication of the Mullinville Recreation Board, which owns the building and maintains and makes repairs as necessary.
   
 "I'm amazed at how people from all over the country are in awe of the beauty of the old building and enjoy just touring the building," said Clayton. "I enjoy the comments and it's exciting when former students come back to visit."

BATTLE CREEK — When Ken Sunden gets the itch to solve a problem, it’s nearly impossible for him to avoid scratching it. Sunden found this to be true when he and his wife Debbie purchased a puppy, Chaos, from Ohio-based dog breeder Susan Endsley five years ago. Sunden learned two of the five puppies were small for gestational age (SGA) and did not survive. SGA puppies are essentially the runts of the runts and have difficulty regulating their body temperature. After buying Chaos, “I was pulling off into rest stops while I was driving around during the day and sketching out how I would make an incubator for her — I know, that sounds totally normal,” Sunden said sarcastically. “I built one and gave it to (Endsley), in part because I had empathy for her and also in part because I wanted to build it and stop thinking about how I would make an incubator,” he added. Sunden eventually built a business around the product, called Puppywarmer. He has developed a series of proprietary incubators primarily used to support puppies that have gone through a stressful or traumatic event. This includes SGA puppies or those born via cesarean section. Instead of blowing warm air like traditional incubators, the Puppywarmer uses an infrared heater that emits wavelengths to heat a puppy about an inch into its body. A sensor monitors and controls the air temperature while the closed cell foam floor mat warms up similar to how the sun heats asphalt. This ensures puppies are warmed from all sides. The company also offers a coinciding oxygen concentrator, which can be used in tandem with the incubator. Those units are manufactured by a third party based on Puppywarmer’s specifications. Puppywarmer now operates a 5,000-square-foot facility at 4950 W. Dickman Road in Battle Creek, the same facility that houses the city’s economic development arm Battle Creek Unlimited. The Sundens are at the helm of Puppywarmer in addition to two full-time employees. The company has the capacity to manufacture roughly 100 incubators a week. Breeders, veterinarians, nonprofit organizations and educational institutions have all used the Puppywamer, some calling it an emerging industry innovation. A reluctant entrepreneur Sunden’s professional background is rooted in technical sales. His most recent stop was a 17-year tenure at Nexthermal Corp. in Battle Creek, a company that specializes in smart heat management and thermal engineering. Even after hatching the idea for Puppywarmer and discovering that Endsley found overwhelming success with it — saving 17 of the next 18 SGA puppies — he continued on with his full-time job. Ultimately, Endsley convinced him to produce the incubators on a wider scale. “She pushed me to start this company — I was a very reluctant entrepreneur,” Sunden said. “It took her about nine months of sending me photos of puppies that she saved with the incubator (until) I broke down and said I could really do this as a hobby business.” Sunden assumed he could sell around 10 to 25 incubators a year, but the demand for the product has pushed him to sell 1,000 units within the first five years of the company. Most of those sales were in 2020. Sunden connected with Battle Creek Unlimited, which assisted him in finding production space. Yet another reason for pause in his new entrepreneurial journey came when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Just before the pandemic prompted statewide shutdowns, Sunden had issued his 60-day notice at Nexthermal and did not have any orders for incubators yet. “I wouldn’t have had the courage to do it had I known how bad the pandemic would be,” he admitted. Sunden forged ahead expecting dismal sales but instead is poised to finish 2020 with three times more sales than in 2019. In October 2020 alone, Puppywarmer completed eight times as many sales compared to the same month last year. While Sunden had to juggle mild supply chain cramps, his foresight to stockpile the core elements of his incubators ensured that orders were fulfilled quickly. He credits people familiar with his product for acting as ambassadors for it. “They seemed to become really vocal with people they knew and really vocal on how they saved puppies with this system,” Sunden said. “We had not advertised to any great degree at all up until this point.” Game-changer One of the first incubators Sunden donated was to Leader Dogs for the Blind, a Rochester Hills- based nonprofit that trains guide dogs for the blind. Leader Dogs has an onsite vet clinic and about 150 dogs at any given time. The organization has 90 breeders in its breeding program and produces about 500 puppies a year. The puppies are born and raised in host homes until they are seven weeks old and enter the program. Leader Dogs Director of Veterinary Services Dr. David Smith, who has been with the organization for 35 years, primarily uses Puppywarmer for C-sections. The puppies are placed in the incubator while their mother wakes up from anesthesia and can nurse. “It was needed, especially when you’re combining oxygen and the constant, reliable rate of heat,” Smith said of Puppywarmer. “The ease of cleaning and disinfection of this product is just amazing. It’s really been a game-changer and the price point is such that it is available to most veterinarians even if they don’t (have a very big) puppy practice.” Smith said he attends a yearly meeting for reproductive specialists and readily recommends Puppywarmer to universities and organizations that teach future veterinarians. In fact, Puppywarmer is already used at Ohio State University, Oregon State University and Louisiana State University for teaching C-sections. While veterinarians primarily use advanced technology akin to hospital equipment within their practices, the industry still lacked an effective solution for warming puppies. “We didn’t have anything very sophisticated — I’m not sure why it took so long for someone to figure it out,” said Dr. Randall Carpenter, an associate veterinarian at Family Friends Veterinary Hospital near Grand Rapids. “Heating pads were used, but those were very dangerous,” he said. Just in the week Carpenter spoke with MiBiz, he had used the incubator three times already — ranging from C-section puppies to a bulldog puppy that underwent throat surgery. Carpenter said he could see Puppywarmer in every vet clinic across the country. “And, not just vet clinics, but for anyone that is raising small animals,” he added. “It would work for reptiles and could be great for birds. We use it mostly for puppies, but anyone that has anything to do with animals where they need to keep a constant temperature, it would work very well for that.” Sunden acknowledged the Puppywarmer has potential to address a variety of alternative applications, and said some clients have implored him to create a similar incubator for larger animals. For now, he is focused on perfecting his line of puppy incubators, which will feature new versions to be released soon.

GA: It's not just the holidays, but it's understanding around the fact that, in certain ways, emotions will be heightened. We want to take everything personally, everything is somehow a personal attack on us — rather than, at the end of the day, we are all struggling in one way or another, in ways that are seen and unseen. As long as we put the kids first, and don't include them in adult feelings and anger, as long as we center their peace — that is the best co-parenting tip I can give. And I know it's hard. I know there are a lot of hurt feelings and unresolved things the adults are dealing with, or not, but never put that on the kids, and certainly not when everyone is feeling "a certain kind of way," as the kids say. Make sure the kids have peace, and you'll be set.
