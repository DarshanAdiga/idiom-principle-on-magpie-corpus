“I’m a city kid and a big believer in body language and all this and that,” Gettleman said. “It’s not great, it’s not perfect, it’s OK. For me, what we miss is watching them interact, watching them in your facility. By not having pro days, you also miss that personal contact. Watching guys among their peers and how they operate, how they’re received. That tells a lot when you just watch a kid in those circumstances.
 “Obviously, when we would go to workouts, a lot of times the night before, our coach and scout that would be at the pro day would take one, two or three of the players out to dinner and have some conversation that way. We have the visual touchpoint, but we’re really missing out on the personal touchpoint, when you can smell or feel a guy.”
 Baltimore Ravens GM Eric DeCosta said one of the biggest challenges with lack of visits is assessing injured players.
 “We’ve had to really work with our training staff and with the college training staffs to get as much updated information as possible,” DeCosta said.
 Agents are helping players post videos on social media because they missed out on pro days. It’s especially important for prospects who weren’t invited to the combine.
 Isiah Perkins, a cornerback from University of New Hampshire, posted a “virtual” pro day. He ran a 4.47 40 and had impressive numbers overall.
 “I wish I could have ran those times in front of the scouts,” he said.
 Kelley ran a 4.49 40 at the combine, but still posted a video doing drills last week.
 “It shows he’s still working, he’s staying in good shape,” McManimie said.
 Agent Andre Odom said “communication is paramount” during this unique pre- draft period.
 “One of the things we’ve done is stay in direct contact with teams, making sure we help to streamline the virtual process as best as possible,” Odom said.
 Leigh Steinberg, who represents potential top-15 picks in Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa and Jerry Jeudy, remembers a much simpler time in 1975 when he represented No. 1 overall pick Steve Bartkowski.
 “They had game film and All-Star games. No combine, no pro days, no passing days, no visits to teams or visits to campuses,” Steinberg said. “The reality is these players have been scouted. The truth of the matter is the best predictor of future success is past success, so it’s game film. They have enough information to have scouted successfully. I think when we look down the road in five years, the picks will be as productive and the same percentage of mistakes will have been made.”

New York - The PGA Tour laid out an ambitious plan Thursday to resume its season the second week of June and keep fans away for at least a month, conceding that any return to golf depends on whether it can be played safely amid the coronavirus outbreak.
 The Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas, was pushed back to June 11-14. Assuming golf gets the green light from government and health officials, the tour then would have an official tournament every week through Dec. 6 except for a Thanksgiving break.

Secrets can be nearly impossible to contain, and such is the case with Hidden Pond Resort. After my visit to this secluded spot, tucked into a 60-acre pocket of Kennebunkport on the southern coast of Maine, wild horses couldn't keep me from dishing about my discovery.      Sure, I was already familiar with walkable downtown Kennebunkport. Its greenways and charming streets hold a special place in my heart. It feels like time travel to a town where people still stroll, couples walk hand in hand, and everyone greets each other.      I was shocked when my sister, Cheryl, who resides less than two hours south, confessed she'd never been there. In an instant, the idea to celebrate her upcoming birthday at Kennebunkport's much-acclaimed Hidden Pond was hatched.      Check-in at Hidden Pond takes place in a building nestled in the depths of a birch tree forest that was part of an old estate. Here, we were given a map of the property and pointed to the road where we'd find our accommodations, aptly named The Stargazer. We were impressed with this bi-level, two-bedroom, three bath cottage -- and even more impressed by its interior, with its screened porch, full kitchen and dining room, fireplaced living room and outdoor shower.      The bedrooms were equally luxurious, no quibbling necessary. We left our luggage in our respective rooms and headed back out to locate The Tree Spa, where pre-scheduled aromatherapy massages were calling our names. The surrounding beauty of nature distracted us from following our map, however, and we walked straight past Earth, Hidden Pond's critically raved-about restaurant. Once we backtracked our steps, we stopped inside the restaurant for direction. Inside, we admired its eclectic decor, and outside, the saltwater pool was inviting, and right behind the pool, voila ­-- the Tree Spa. Ensconced in treehouse-style massage rooms, we inhaled both the aroma of the pine trees outside and the lavender oil being expertly rubbed onto our skin.      Afterward, relaxed and rubbery, we called one of Hidden Pond's complimentary shuttles, with the goal of hitting happy hour at Hidden Pond's sister property, The Tides Beach Club.      The club's unobstructed view of Goose Rocks Beach and the crash of waves against the rocks mesmerized us as we sipped on a pair of watermelon Cosmos. Could it get any better? Why yes, it could, I realized as I tucked into a best-of-my-life Maine lobster roll, paired perfectly with a glass (or two) of chilled Chablis. The club's bar scene was lively, and we met a few patrons who said they'd returned to Hidden Pond twice, thrice or four times. This was not all that surprising.      Energized and not quite ready for the night to end, we stopped by the resort's communal firepit and indulged in s'mores, with all the luxury makin's ready for use, courtesy of Earth restaurant.      My sister is an early bird, and by the time I wandered downstairs from my blissful night's sleep, she had already dug into the coffee and pastries conveniently left on our doorstep. This was a "light" breakfast, but a heartier version is available at Earth.      We had a game plan for Cheryl's birthday and were soon on the road to Ricker Hill Orchards, a ninth-generation family farm about 60 minutes inland, to pick organic apples. Apple picking made us hungry, so we fueled up at Terry & Maxine's in the town of Turner. Their turkey and Swiss Rachel sandwich hit the proverbial spot.      Next stop, downtown Kennebunkport. As I'd hoped would happen, Cheryl was enchanted by the town and its unique shops, eateries and art galleries lining the charming streets.      Back at Hidden Pond, we headed to its garden shed, where we were encouraged to grab a vase and clip an arrangement of local wildflowers to grace the table at our cottage.      As the climax to this birthday weekend, I had arranged dinner for us at Earth. Our farm-to-fork meal featured an innovative menu created by Hidden Pond's Executive Chef Joe Schafer. It incorporated vegetables and herbs picked from Earth's on-site organic farm, freshly caught seafood and meats sourced from local purveyors.      No late-night s'mores for us this evening; we simply rolled back to The Stargazer cottage, flicked a switch, and chilled out by the gas fireplace for a while. We checked out the following morning, begrudgingly, as we longed to stay forever, hidden in the fold of Hidden Pond. Alas, it was time to return to real life.

Güneydoğu Anadolu Halı İhracatçıları Birliği Yönetim Kurulu korona virüs (Covid19) salgını nedeniyle alınan önlemlerden dolayı telekonferans sistemiyle toplanarak halı sektörünün sorunlarını tartıştı, Türkiye ve dünya gündemiyle ilgili konuları da görüşen Yönetim Kurulu Üyeleri Mayıs ayından itibaren her şeyin normale dönmeye başlayacağını ümit ettiklerini ifade etti.   Ahmet Kaplan başkanlığında Güneydoğu Anadolu Halı İhracatçı Birlikleri Yönetim Kurulu telekonferansla toplantı düzenledi. Sektörün sorunlarının yanı sıra gündemde yer alan konularında tartışıldığı toplantıda korona virüs salgınına yönelik alınan tedbirler de görüşüldü. Toplantı sonrası bir değerlendirme yapan GAHİB Başkanı Ahmet Kaplan “Sektörümüz dünya makine halısı ihracatında yüzde 54’lük bir paya sahip olup, ülkemiz için önemli bir sektördür. Gaziantepli halıcılar olarak bu payın yüzde 60’ını biz yönetiyoruz. Bu anlamda sektörümüz dinamik bir sektördür. Dünya genelinde insanlığı tehdit eden korona virüs salgını elbette sektörümüzü etkilenmiştir. Ancak ilerleyen süreçte sektörümüz en hızlı bir şekilde kendisini toparlayacak yapıya sahiptir. Sanayicilerimizin özverisiyle birlikte beklentimiz en kısa sürede bilim dünyasının bu salgına karşı önlem alması ve bu sorundan ülkemiz dahil, bütün insanlığın kurtulmasıdır” dedi.   Halı üreticilerin umudu Mayıs 2020   Dünyayı etkisi altına alan ve dünya genelinde birçok ülkede uygulanan tedbirlerden dolayı ihracatın olumsuz etkilendiğini ifade eden GAHİB Başkanı Ahmet Kaplan üreticilerin Mayıs 2020 itibarıyla ideal üretim kapasitesine ulaşmasını ümit ettiklerini sözlerine ekleyerek “Sektördeki firmalarımızla yaptığımız görüşmelerde Nisan 2020 sonu itibarıyla üretim kapasitemizi arttırarak üretime devam etmeyi planlıyoruz. Mayıs ayı içerisinde ise ideal kapasitemize yaklaşmayı hedefliyoruz. Korona virüs salgını nedeniyle etkilenen sektörlere yönelik devletimizin verdiği destekleri olumlu buluyoruz. İnşallah ilerleyen süreçte bu desteklere ihtiyacımız kalmaz. Ancak ihtiyaç olursa da bu desteklerin devam edeceğine ve rakamların revize edileceğine inanıyoruz” dedi.   “Sorunlarımızı el birliğiyle çözeceğiz”   Dünya genelinde salgından bütün sektörlerin olumsuz etkilendiğine de dikkat çeken Başkan Kaplan, Türkiye’nin en az zararla sıkıntıları çözeceğine inandıklarını da ifade ederek, “Elimizden geldiği kadar bu dar günleri el ele vererek birlikte atlatmamız lazım. Bundan sonra da süreç olarak sektör olarak güçleneceğimize inanıyoruz. Günümüzde yaşadığımız talep ertelenmesi elbette uygulanan karantinalarla ilgilidir. Bilim dünyasının korona virüs salgınına yönelik çalışmalarının sonuçlanmasının ardından mevcut iş potansiyelimizin çok daha üstünde bir üretime ulaşacağımıza, gelen talepleri karşılamak için olağanüstü bir çalışma temposuna gireceğimize inanıyoruz” dedi.   “Salgın sonrası üretim ve ihracat patlaması yaşayabiliriz”   Sektörümüzün ideal üretim kapasitesine ulaşmasının Mayıs 2020 olarak düşünüldüğünü ve salgın sonrası ilk etapta uluslararası dolaşımın sınırlı olabileceğini ifade eden Başkan Kaplan, halı sektörünün bu krizi fırsata çevirerek Mayıs, Haziran ve Temmuz 2020’de üretim ve ihracat rekorları kırabileceğini belirterek, “Diğer taraftan bu salgınla ilgili olarak önümüzdeki süreçlerde özellikle Mayıs, Haziran ve Temmuz aylarında birçok ülkede insanların uluslararası dolaşıma sıcak bakmayacağını, bu sürecin sektörümüze olumlu yansıyacağını ümit ediyoruz. Bu süreçten güçlenerek çıkacağımıza inanıyoruz. Tek dileğimiz vatandaşlarımızın uyarılara ve kurallara uyarak bu süreci belirlenen şeklinde geçirmeleridir. Elbette önceliğimiz insan sağlığı olup vatandaşlarımızın uyarılara ve kurallara uymasını temenni ediyoruz” dedi.

The Bayern Munich winger's participation at the tournament had long been in doubt due to the problem, which kept him out of France's warm-up games with Norway and Paraguay.
 Ribery had hoped to be fit for Sunday's clash with Jamaica, but was withdrawn from the national squad by coach Didier Deschamps on Friday.
 Lyon midfielder Clement Grenier has also been omitted due to a thigh problem, with Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin and Montpellier playmaker Remy Cabella coming in as the replacements.
 The absence of Ribery serves as a huge blow to France's prospects in Brazil, and the 31-year-old was understandably downbeat at the news.
 "It is like a death in the soul that I am forced to leave the France team and give up on the World Cup," he told the French Football Federation's (FFF) website.
 "I always hoped to be able to play against Jamaica but when I pushed it physically on Friday morning it aggravated my back pain.
 "The MRI scan confirmed those feelings and therefore my inability to train and play normally.
 "In these conditions and despite the efforts of the medical staff, who I thank sincerely, my absence was inevitable."

Reliance Industries has mopped up Rs 8,500 crore from the sale of non- convertible debentures (NCDs), cashing in on the cheaper funds flooding the debt market that is starved of quality paper, priced it at 7.20 per cent. The debt market is flushed with money after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) opened a special repo operations called the targeted long term repo operations (TLTRO) on March 27, which offers banks funds at the repo rate which is currently pegged at 4.40 per cent. The Reliance Industries (RIL) offer gives a coupon of 280 bps premium on the repo rate. “RIL has mopped up Rs 8,500 crore from an NCD issue today (Friday). The issue consist of a three-year fixed tenor tranche of Rs 4,000 crore offering 7.20 per cent coupon, and a Rs 4,500-crore floating rate tranche offering 7.2 per cent, which is a 280-bps spread over the repo rate,” a market source told PTI.
 The issue, which had hit the market Thursday, has been mostly subscribed by State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, the source added. The company was planning to mop up Rs 9,000 crore in two tranches of Rs 4,500 crore each in with a fixed rate and floating rate coupons of 7.20 per cent.
 It can be noted that RIL is the most-cash rich company as also one of the most indebted corporates sitting on debt pile of over Rs 1.54 lakh crore as of March 2020. According to an exchange filing, RIL would use the proceeds from the NCD sale to repay existing rupee loans and would be issued through a private placement of consisting of 30,000 unsecured redeemable fixed coupon, non-convertible debentures under the PPD (privately placed debentures) series K1. Each NCD has a face value of Rs 10 lakh each aggregating to Rs 3,000 crore along with a greenshoe option for oversubscription up to Rs 1,500 crore, aggregating in cash to Rs 4,500 crore.
 The RBI had promised to pump Rs 1 lakh crore to the market through the targeted long term repo operations (TLTRO). Of the total amount it has already infused Rs 75,000 crore into the system and the final tranche is in the market as this copy is being written. Under the TLTRO announced on March 27, banks get three-year funds at the repo rate of 4.40 per cent but have to invest 50 per cent of the fund in NCDs/CPs or any other corporate debt.
 Earlier this week the RBI however, restricted single company exposure to 10 per cent of the raised amount - which means say if SBI has mopped Rs 10,000 crore through this route it can invest only Rs 1,000 crore of this in the RIL issue. According to media reports, the TLTRO window is being tapped by HDFC, PowerGrid, NHB and also Hudco.
 The Reserve Bank announced the TLTRO at lower yields to be parked in the secondary market and invest in primary issues as part of its initiatives to help borrowers cope with the economic damage inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier in the day on Friday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that it has been decided to conduct targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO 2.0) for an aggregate amount of Rs 50,000 crore, to begin with, in tranches of appropriate sizes.
 The RIL debentures are rated AAA/Stable by both Crisil and Care Ratings, the filing had said, adding the issue will hit the market on April 16 and close the next day and will have a three-year tenor with annual coupon payout. While Axis Trustee Services has managed the issue which will be traded on bourses, Link Intime was the registrar and HDFC Bank was the arranger.
 For the quarter to December 2019, RIL's consolidated turnover stood at Rs 1,68,858 crore and net profit at Rs 11,640 crore. The RIL counter was trading 2.7 per cent up at Rs 1200 on the BSE whose benchmark Sensex that was trading up 1.7 per cent up at 1240 hrs.

European shares jumped on Friday, clawing back weekly declines as financial markets globally drew comfort from U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for a gradual re-opening of the U.S. economy and reports of a potential drug to treat COVID-19. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 2.6%, gaining in seven of the past eight sessions on tentative signs the pandemic was peaking in the worst hit parts of the continent.
 All the major European sub-sectors were trading higher, with mining stocks on track for their best day in more than three weeks on the back of higher commodity prices. "The market's right in saying the worst is over for the coronavirus, but what it is wrong about is assuming that from here on it's a straight path to normalisation," said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard in London.
 "The market needs to come to grip with two things: the first is that we're not going back to normal and that social distancing will be enforced for the foreseeable future. The second is the pandemic's economic shock." The benchmark STOXX 600 has now recovered about 24% since hitting an eight-year low in March, powered by a raft of global stimulus, but gains were subdued in the past week with economic data and quarterly earnings underlining the business hit from lockdown measures.
 Latest data showed China suffered its worst economic contraction in almost three decades, while weekly U.S. jobless claims pushed the total for the past month above 20 million, yet there was no sign of weakness on Wall Street or in Asia. Late on Thursday, Trump laid out new guidelines to re-open U.S. states in a staggered, three-stage approach, but his plan was thin on detail and left decisions largely up to individual states.
 Lifting the mood further on Friday, a report detailed encouraging partial data from trials of U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc's experimental drug remdesivir in severe COVID-19 patients. "If proven effective, remdesivir would be a game-changer in the COVID-19 pandemic fight, especially being a legacy drug that has been around for many years," said Jeffrey Halley, a market analyst at OANDA.

The general decrease in oil and gas activity in Western Canada in early 2019 negatively impacted Hawk's results in the past year. Activity in the sector improved in the second half of 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020. However, the recent oil price decline based on the actions of Saudi Arabia and Russia, is expected to result in a decrease in business for Hawk for the remainder of 2020. Hawk's management is taking a proactive approach with a view to ensuring that its production team is sized for the expected activity levels. As previously announced, plant operations have been temporarily suspended to date in April, and are expected to be reinstated, on a limited production basis, beginning the week of April 20, 2020. Management of Hawk has also expanded its sales team in recent months and is taking steps toward further customer and industry diversification.

 Despite seeing his country go out at the group stage for the first time since 1958, Rooney has given his full support to coach Hodgson, as England begin to set their sights on their UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.
 "No doubt about it, Roy is the man to take us forward," the Manchester United striker told a press conference.
 "We appreciate what he has done. In my opinion he has changed the way we play and you can see the progression.
 "I know the results have been disappointing but as a team we can feel we're getting better and hopefully this will make us better as a team.
 "He's put great enthusiasm into the team and put a great set of young, exciting players in place."
 As they come to terms with the bitter disappointment of an early departure from Brazil, Rooney has also called upon the rest of the England squad to use the failure as a motivating factor in the future.
 "The young players can come to this tournament and learn from it, we all can," he added.
 "It's vital we do that. We have to remember the pain and come the next tournament we have to make sure we don't feel that again."

Net leasing of office space fell 37 per cent during January-March period to nearly 7.4 million sq ft across eight major cities as corporates deferred their decision to hire workspace amid global economic slowdown caused by COVID-19, according to Cushman & Wakefield. According to the data, the net absorption of office space declined to 73,98,041 sq ft during the first three months of this year from 1,16,55,242 sq ft in the corresponding period of the last year. "The net absorption in Q1 2020 stands at 7.40 million sq ft, which is lower by 22.6 per cent on a quarterly basis and 36.5 per cent lower on a yearly basis as transaction slippage impacted the leasing momentum towards the end of the quarter," C&W; said in its quarterly report. "The year started off with great momentum continuing from the last quarter of 2019. But by the end of Q1, the headwinds from global economic slowdown on the back of COVID-19 pandemic saw activity tapering off," said Anshul Jain, Managing Director – South East Asia and India, C&W.; However, he expected the leasing activities to pick up later this year.
 Office space leasing dropped in five cities out of eight covered in this report. As per the data, Bengaluru, the biggest commercial real estate market in India, saw 45 per cent decline in net office leasing at 26,26,452 sq ft during January-March 2020 from 47,95,916 sq ft in the year ago period.

England are set to meet Italy in their FIFA World Cup opener in Group D on Saturday, in a match that could have a big impact on who qualifies for the knockout stages.
 The two sides met in the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2012, with Italy emerging as winners on penalties on that occasion having largely dominated the game.
 However, Manchester United striker Rooney believes that Roy Hodgson's young squad has improved significantly since then.
 "I think we've moved ahead of Italy," he said at a press conference. "We have a youthful squad so it will be interesting to see how we have progressed.
 Much talk has surrounded England's ability to shackle Andrea Pirlo, who enjoyed a fine game in the Euro 2012 meeting between the teams.
 Yet Rooney added: "Really the Italians should be looking at how to control us.
 "We're not too focused on Pirlo. He's fantastic and they've got some great players, but so have we, so they should be more worried about our team."
 Danny Welbeck missed training for England on Wednesday due to a thigh problem, but Rooney played down talk of his club colleague being unavailable for the clash with Italy.
 "He'll be ready for Saturday, he's just not risked anything," explained Rooney.

After consecutive 2-1 losses to Italy and Uruguay, England needed Cesare Prandelli's side to do them a favour by beating Costa Rica on Friday, but the Italians succumbed to a surprising 1-0 defeat.
 Although qualification looked highly unlikely before Costa Rica's win, the result confirmed England’s elimination with a game still to be played in Group D.
 Rooney's performances in Brazil were placed under huge scrutiny, though he has played key roles in both goals scored by the team in tournament, netting one and assisting Daniel Sturridge's effort against Italy.
 "Absolutely devastated to be out of the World Cup," he said on his official Facebook page.
 "Going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it hasn't worked out.
 "Sorry to all the fans that travelled and at home that we haven't done better... gutted!"
 Manager Roy Hodgson has been publicly backed by the Football Association despite their elimination, and the 66-year-old is confident they can make an impact at future tournaments.
 He said: "We had high hopes, we thought we could make an impact, but we haven't won the games. To make an impact you have to win games and we've lost both of ours.
 "I believed the team, going forward, would be a very good team - there are a lot of good young players. Even against Uruguay we saw some good individual performances.
 "But results colour everything. I don't think there is any need to have doubts that this group of players will go on to do some good things in times ahead.
 "The team is evolving and I'm proud of the way they have approached this tournament, everything they have put into it.
 "We've worked so hard, we've done so much preparation for this tournament, we think we came to the tournament well-prepared.
 "We had really big hopes that we were going to make the country proud by going far in the tournament, but we haven't done that."

 During times like this (I hope I never see the likes of this again), it can be difficult to remember what we should be grateful for. I'm grateful for a roof over my head, food in my belly, good health and the good health of my loved ones and, hopefully, a thriving business when it's up and running again. I think it's important to pause in the midst of our busy lives, take a few deep breaths and experience the healing energy of gratitude -- to focus on the positive, not the negative, during the coronavirus.
 While we self isolate, take a look around at your family members. When will you have another opportunity to spend so much time with them? To give your full attention to your children and answer their questions and be fully present for these teachable moments. To lead by example (flip out in private, please) so that you reassure your kids that everything will be OK; different but OK.
 I hope that we, as a society, make the necessary changes so that we have a more equitable society -- housing, food, jobs, education and health care for everyone! A government that works for all of us, not just the advantaged. We, the people, can make this happen. We have the power with our votes!
 My wish for this holiday season is that we no longer turn a blind eye to all forms of injustice, from racism to income inequality. It's time to pull together and remember what binds us, not what separates us. We're all human, regardless of race, religion, political beliefs, etc. We all have similar needs -- to love and be loved, to work at something meaningful and to feel that our lives matter.
 I love reading stories about how so many people are pitching in to help their neighbors and others through this pandemic. I hope we don't forget what we've learned when our lives go forward to our new normal.
 I know how difficult it is to \"look on the bright side of things\" during a time of such uncertainty. For those of you suffering from depression, substance use disorder or other forms of mental illness, please know that there is help just a phone call or email away. Please reach out to those around you and let them know you're struggling. You are not alone.
 For those of you who believe in a higher power, prayer is very powerful. I can't stress enough about getting outside in the sun and fresh air. You don't even have to go for a walk; just sit outside in nature and take some deep breaths.
 A word about fostering and adopting a pet during this time. Only do it if you can take care of an animal's needs after you return to work. If you don't have the time, energy or finances to properly care for a pet going forward, please don't adopt. That cute animal depends on you for food, love, health care, etc. It's a responsibility to take care of another being (something like kids) and not something to do halfway.
 We have two cats (Coco and Lucy) and my precious Pomeranian, Teddy, inherited from my son (sometimes I prefer the dog to the adult child!). I've fallen totally in love with him and vice versa. I work from home so my pets get plenty of attention but that's not everyone's lifestyle.
 This is a good time to reach out to others while you're self isolating. I've been keeping in touch with people around the country (and I'm not on social media!). I call, text or email on a regular basis to make sure those I love are OK. Yes, it's time consuming, but well worth it.
 I'm enjoying this time where life is a little slower and I feel more connected to people than ever before. I will continue to keep in touch after life returns to a more hectic routine. I don't want to forget what I've learned during this time.
 Let's all move forward into the future more aware of those around us -- to offer a smile or a helping hand when needed. God bless.

BEIJING (AP) — Bleak figures from the world's two largest economies underscore how quickly the coronavirus is delivering a massive economic blow.China on Friday reported GDP shrank 6.8% from a year ago in the quarter ending March, its worst contraction since before market-style economic reforms began in 1979. And in the U.S., the world's largest economy, the ranks of the unemployed swelled toward levels last seen during the Great Depression.Still, the economic data from China was not as bad as some had feared, prompting shares in Asia to surge. That was after Wall Street also rose, powered by buying of Amazon, health care stocks and other market niches that are thriving in the coronavirus crunch.The recovery for workers is likely to take a long time, however. Some forecasters earlier said China might rebound as early as this month, but they have been cutting growth forecasts and pushing back recovery timelines as negative trade, retail sales and other data pile up.The U.S. government reported 5.2 million more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the four-week total to 22 million — easily the worst stretch of U.S. job losses on record. The losses translate to about 1 in 7 American workers.South Korea on Friday reported its worst jobless figures in more than a decade, with almost 200,000 fewer people working in March than in the same month a year earlier.President Donald Trump reacted to the pressure on the economy by outlining a phased approach to reopening parts of the country where the pandemic is being brought under control.He told the nation’s governors that restrictions could be eased to allow businesses to reopen over the next several weeks in places that have extensive testing and a marked decrease in COVID-19 cases.“We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time,” Trump said, adding that his new guidelines give governors the freedom to act as they see fit.His comments marked an abrupt change after a week in which he clashed with governors over his claim that he had “total” authority over how and when the country reopens.Worldwide, the outbreak has infected more than 2.1 million people and killed more than 144,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, though the true numbers are believed to be much higher. The death toll in the U.S. topped 33,000, with more than 670,000 confirmed infections.China raised its death toll to over 4,600 after the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak first took hold, added nearly 1,300 deaths. State media said the undercount was due to insufficient admission capabilities at overwhelmed medical facilities. Questions have long swirled around the accuracy of China’s case reporting, with some saying officials sought to minimize the outbreak.The spread of the virus is declining in such places as Italy, Spain and France, but rising or continuing at a high level in Britain, Russia and Turkey, authorities said. Singapore reported a record daily high of 728 new cases as it ramped up its testing at dormitories crammed with foreign workers.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the economic impacts of the pandemic were putting many of the world’s children in jeopardy, and urged families and leaders everywhere to help protect them.The U.N. chief said in a video statement that the lives of children were being "totally upended” by COVID-19, with almost all students out of school, family stress levels rising as communities face lockdowns, and reduced household income expected to force poor families to cut back on essential health and food expenditures, which would affect children in particular.In China, retail spending, which accounted for 80% of economic growth last year, plunged 19% in the first quarter from a year earlier, below most forecasts. Investment in factories, real estate and other fixed assets, the other major growth driver, sank 16.1%.Factories and other businesses were allowed to reopen even as the United States and Europe tightened controls. Cinemas, hair salons and other enterprises that are deemed nonessential but employ millions of people are still closed, and tourism is struggling to recover.In Russia, President Vladimir Putin postponed the grand Victory Day parade on May 9 in Red Square marking the 75th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War II. Since Soviet times, Victory Day has been the nation’s most important holiday, reflecting wartime losses put at more than 27 million dead.New York, the most lethal hot spot in the U.S., reported more encouraging signs, with a drop in the daily number of deaths statewide and the overall count of people in the hospital.“We’ve controlled the beast,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Still, Cuomo extended the state’s lockdown through at least May 15. New York City is lining up 11,000 empty hotel rooms to quarantine people living in crowded apartment buildings.In New Jersey, police acting on an anonymous tip found at least 18 bodies over two days at a nursing home in Andover Township that were waiting to be picked up by a funeral home.Economists said U.S. unemployment could reach 20% in April, the highest since the Depression of the 1930s. Layoffs are spreading well beyond stores, restaurants and hotels to white-collar professionals such as software programmers and legal assistants.Lifting of restrictions, when it happens, won’t be like flipping a switch. Restaurants and other businesses may be reopened in phases, with perhaps a limited number of entrances or reduced seating areas, while supermarkets may stick with one-way aisles and protective shields at the cash registers, experts say.“It might be ‘back to normal’ for everyone else, but people still don’t feel comfortable gathering at restaurants and bars,” said Jeremiah Juncker, manager of the Rappourt pub in Ann Arbor, Michigan.Many European countries, like the U.S., have seen heavy job losses, but places like Germany and France are using government subsidies to keep millions of people on payrolls.Italy’s hard-hit Lombardy region is pushing to restart manufacturing in early May, while Britain extended restrictions at least three more weeks. Switzerland announced staggered re- openings.“The transition is beginning,” Swiss Home and Health Minister Alain Berset said. “We want to go as fast as possible, and as slow as necessary.”___Perry reported from Wellington, New Zealand.

The debt financing agreements relating to the Group's long-term debt contain restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants may place significant restrictions on, among other things, the ability of the Group to incur additional indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to pay dividends, to redeem equity or debt or make certain other payments, investments, capital expenditures, loans and guarantees and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with another entity. The financing agreements also contain a number of financial covenants that require the Group to meet certain financial ratios and financial condition tests. A failure to comply with the obligations and covenants under the financing agreements relating to the credit facility could result in an event of default under such agreements, as the case may be, which, if not cured or waived, could permit acceleration of indebtedness. If the indebtedness under such agreements were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that the assets of the Group would be sufficient to repay that indebtedness in full.

Expectation levels are high surrounding the Barcelona forward as the final preparations are made in Brazil ahead of the start of the showpiece on Thursday.
 Passionate home support for Luiz Felipe Scolari's men is guaranteed and Ronaldo - a two-time World Cup winner and the tournament's all-time record goalscorer - expects the 22-year-old to rise to the occasion.
 "He's very good," observed Ronaldo.
 "Neymar is an incredible guy, a great player, a youngster like I was in the first World Cup I played, which was in '98.
 "In '94 I was even younger but I didn't play.
 "I'm sure he's very calm, he can handle the pressure well.
 "He's a player who's shown that over and over. We have high hopes that he will be the best player in the tournament and that Brazil will be champions."
 Croatia face Brazil in the opening game in Sao Paulo and Ronaldo is confident that the South American nation will put on a World Cup to savour.
 The three-time FIFA World Player of the Year added: "It's fantastic to have the World Cup here in Brazil, which is one of the, if not the biggest sporting event on earth.
 "To have it here in Brazil is beyond deserved, because we're known worldwide as the football nation. And now we're going to show our culture, people and cities to the world.

World stock markets made a super-charged sprint towards an 11% weekly gain on Friday - their second best of all time - after President Donald Trump laid out plans to gradually reopen the coronavirus-hit U.S. economy following similar moves elsewhere. The bulls were in business. Additional reports that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms had responded positively to a drug made by U.S. company Gilead Sciences had helped Tokyo and Seoul both surge 3% as Asia took a widely-expected slump in Chinese GDP data in its stride.
 Europe's main markets and Wall Street futures made 3% gains in early European trading too, putting the pan-regional STOXX 600 up more than 7% for the week and MSCI's 49-country world index up 10.5% already. "The market continues to look through terrible data... on anticipation of economies reopening," said Steen Jakobsen, Chief Investment Officer at Saxo Bank. "And hopes that a new drug treatment will help lift longer term uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic."
 The data from China had shown the world's second-largest economy shrank for the first time since at least 1992 because of the coronavirus woes. Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 6.8% in the quarter year-on-year, slightly more than expected, and 9.8% from the previous quarter.
 Retail sales also fell more than expected in March, but industrial output dipped only slightly, suggesting its manufacturing sector at least is recovering more quickly. Back in Europe, Italian bond markets, which have been under pressure as the country's virus difficulties push its debt-to-GDP ratio towards 150%, also rallied as France expressed support for joint euro zone debt issuance.
 European countries have "no choice" but to set up a fund that "could issue common debt with a common guarantee", French President Emmanuel Macron told the Financial Times on Thursday. Failure to do so would lead to populists winning elections in Italy, Spain, and possibly France, he also warned. Yields on ultra-safe 10-year U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds rose slightly, while Treasury futures and the dollar firmed against the yen, in another tentative sign of investor optimism.
 Spot gold fell 1.5% to $1,692 per ounce too and with investors looking to take on more risk industrial metal copper jumped 4% on track for its best week since February 2019. No such luck for battered oil markets however. U.S. crude futures slumped 8% to an 18-year low after OPEC had lowered of its global demand forecast on Thursday, and Brent crude slipped back under $28 a barrel having been up nearly 3% at one point.
 OPEC now sees a contraction of global demand of 6.9 million barrels per day (bpd) this year due to the coronavirus outbreak. "Downward risks remain significant, suggesting the possibility of further adjustments, especially in the second quarter," OPEC said of the demand forecast.

The Bayern Munich man saw two shouts for penalties waved away during the last 16 clash in Fortaleza, before finally winning a spot-kick at the third attempt, drawing contact from Mexico captain Rafael Marquez.
 Klaas-Jan Huntelaar converted the stoppage-time penalty to send Netherlands through, and Robben subsequently apologised for going to ground too easily earlier in the contest.
 A FIFA statement on Monday confirmed that Robben would face no action for any alleged dives, and the forward expressed disappointment about the reaction to his remarks.
 "It's a shame," he said in a press conference. "I was honest in the interview after the game, and sometimes you are punished for being honest.
 "I said there was one foul where I went to the ground after he took his leg away. It was a stupid act from me and had nothing to do with the penalty.
 "The penalty was a clear foul and I think this is a shame because we put in a great performance and that is the main thing.
 "I like to be honest and I apologise for this action in the first half and this had no affect on the game.
 "I will continue to be honest, it was one stupid action, but it had no affect on the game.
 "I'm an honest guy, it didn't have any influence on the game."

COVID-19 preys particularly on the elderly and people with underlying health conditions, including those with hypertension, diabetes and cancer. Smokers, found more among men than women, are also more susceptible than nonsmokers to developing serious respiratory problems linked to the disease, according to Omagiri.
 "In battling the infection, our priority is to stop people dying or becoming gravely ill," Omagari said.
 To achieve that goal, he is calling for society-wide cooperation, saying improvements are needed in a variety of areas including informing individuals about how and where they can get tested, increasing testing manpower, and organizing logistics to transport a large amount of specimens.
 "Preparing ample test kits alone will not solve problems in testing capacity," he said.
 Omagari also warned that baseless fears of contracting the disease and social stigma can sometimes obstruct health care services at hospitals and the conducting of tests.
 "I can see such behavior is based on unscientific beliefs in many cases," he said, referring to reports about difficulties in finding firms to transport testing specimens.
 "Unless we alleviate bottlenecks in all those areas, the number of test takers will not increase," Omagari said, suggesting that as the virus spreads, a number of individuals who need testing and treatment might be overlooked unless the testing infrastructure is overhauled.
 As part of the effort to prioritize treatment for patients with severe symptoms, the health ministry has asked prefectural governments to consider securing hotels or preparing facilities to accept those who have tested positive but have mild or no symptoms.
 Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said the metropolitan government, which has already started to transport such patients to designated facilities, aims to secure 1,000 rooms for patients with mild or no symptoms.
 The Tokyo Metropolitan Government confirmed a total of 2,595 coronavirus infections as of Thursday, including 56 deaths. The number of cases reported nationwide topped 10,000, including those from the virus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship, with 204 deaths.
 While some countries like South Korea and a number of European nations have opted to conduct a large-scale testing, the number of tests has remained relatively low in Japan.
 The figure hovered between 1,000 and 2,000 per day from early March, when national health insurance coverage for testing began, before rising to nearly 4,000 in late March and reaching a high of around 7,000, according to health ministry data.
 That number compares with Japan's current testing capacity of 10,000 cases per day, which Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has vowed to raise to 20,000.
 "We can't predict yet when the outbreak will peak (in Japan). It may subside for a while, but we don't know whether a second or third wave of infections will come," Omagari said, noting uncertainty over how the virus will behave from now on, including the influence of warmer weather and age factors.
 "We have to continue battling for the time being," he said.
 Infectious disease experts like Omagari have recently become alarmed at the rise in the number of infections with unidentified routes of transmission around the world, which suggests people with mild or no symptoms are playing a key role in contributing to the spread of the virus.
 U.S. experts including Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said recently that COVID-19 patients are considered infectious 48 hours before symptoms begin, while in some cases no symptoms develop at all.
 Overall, Omagari stressed some key advice: People should avoid going out for the time being to lower the risk of further spreading or contracting the virus.
 "In cases where the majority of infected people have mild symptoms, the disease becomes highly transmissible as those people, unaware they are infected, remain active and travel about," he warned.

The volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices accounts for much of the cyclical nature of the oilfield services business. A downturn in oil and natural gas prices has a direct impact on activities of certain customers of the Group, particularly the customers of Hawk. Generally, there is a higher demand for Hawk's products when oil and gas prices are high. Global oil prices have recently declined significantly based on a combination of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the oversupply of oil from Saudi Arabia and Russia, and the Company anticipates that this could result in a decrease in business for Hawk.

Hey Republicans, go bigger. The Democrats want money for our hospitals. Our hospitals, the ones we count on to save us, need saving. As an example, Sarasota Memorial has experienced a 50% drop in surgeries, a 45% drop in emergency care centers visits, a drop of 66% in business in their seven urgent care centers. Sarasota Memorial lost $16 million in March.
 The Republican Party is the party that loves American heroes. Embrace our hospitals as our superheroes. Propose a bigger hospital rescue package than the Democrats.
 This is the biggest blaze in our lifetimes. Too many fire trucks are still in the stations because Republicans and Democrats would rather fight over who controls the water hose than save Main Street. Then, when they reached a stalemate in the argument, instead of going back to the drawing board, they went on vacation.
 This monstrous blaze is consuming our economic house. Republicans and Democrats are sitting, making s’mores as small businesses and livelihoods are burning down to ashes.

 Gerrard, England's captain at the FIFA World Cup, implored Redknapp to name who these players are to "embarrass" them.
 But the 67-year-old told the _Daily Mail_ : "I understand Steven's concern but I don't want to get into naming names because it wouldn't be fair to the players.      "Every Premier League manager past and present knows what I'm talking about, probably even (England coach) Roy Hodgson. But sadly this attitude is not unusual these days.      "You've only got to look at how many players pull out of an international game on Tuesday and Wednesday then are running about for their clubs the next Saturday to see that this is a very real issue."

The strong performance in business income at the end of 2019 continued into the first months of 2020, before the recent heightened volatility, seen across markets, resulted in much greater activity. As a result, the group delivered exceptionally strong growth in business income during the first quarter, above our long-term, through-the-cycle growth trajectory. This activity has recently begun to normalise, with volumes reverting towards more typical levels. Lower market valuations are expected to impact our revenue performance in certain asset classes, such as equities, balancing the overall full year performance.

Management is also confident that its disciplined acquisition approach is the best path to generating shareholder value in the long term. Decisive continues to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions which, if completed, will bolster its diversity and add strength and resilience to operations. Decisive's acquisition pipeline includes several target companies, however there can be no assurance that target companies identified from time to time will meet Decisive's acquisition criteria or that Decisive will successfully acquire identified target companies that meet such criteria. In addition, given the significant impact that COVID-19 has had on financial markets and the global economy, capital availability may be constrained in the near-term. Management believes that preserving financial strength and flexibility during this time of economic uncertainty will better position the Company to take advantage of potential opportunities once the effects of COVID-19 and low oil prices subside.

This sentiment is part of a larger ongoing discourse about digital rights and related movements championing the right to privacy. To assess the pros and cons of using mobile data as a tool to aid disease tracking, it is important to first understand how mobile tracking works in the first place.

Fifth Street in Apalachicola has been an illegal dumping ground for years - and maybe decades.
   
 In the past, city crews did clean-ups, and last October County Solid Waste Director Fonda Davis did one, though he didn't have to.
   
 But the dumping keeps coming back, at night we think.
   
 Yes, our police officers search through the trash for clues to who dumped it. The dumpers know to remove such traces.
   
 So how can we fix this eyesore once and for all? I say clean up the city-owned lots, and turn them into workforce housing.
   
 If people lived there, the dumpers wouldn't dump, and the city would get some revenue from parcels that now only cost us money.
   
 Here's how it could happen.
   
 The city owns about six single family lots on that side of 5th Street, with perhaps the potential for two more. It would be a perfect spot for shotgun- style houses.
   
 At present, that city-owned land is used for a water tower, and a yard for spare and broken-down equipment. The tower isn't going anywhere, but our public works department has plenty of room for extra equipment at its main location out near the airport.
   
 Here's how we could make workforce housing a reality:
   
 1) Use our Community Redevelopment Agency money to clean up the area and build the first house. The CRA mission is to clear blight, and encourage economic development and affordable housing. The city could retain ownership and offer manageable rent to teachers, police officers, public health workers, or doctors.
   
 2) Use our CRA money to clean up the area, and then sell the first two lots to private individuals. That would fund future workforce housing projects.
   
 3) Use our CRA money to clean up the area, then partner with a contractor to build workforce housing. (We can also use the regular city budget and staff for clean-up)
   
 Our trashy eyesore could become a beautiful, affordable place to live for a few working families. Who wouldn't want to live with a beautiful state park in their back yard?
   
 There's one more possibility.
   
 You wouldn't know it because of all the trash, but our historic early 1900s brick waterworks building is on 5th Street too. Much of it is damaged, but someone with money could save it.
   
 The options are to give the structure and one lot to a person who commits to put at least $200,000 into a restoration. Or if that doesn't work, clean the lot and sell the historic bricks.
   
 Is 5th Street an ambitious project? Yes. But if we don't act, that area will continue to look like a dump.
   
 Consider the Orman House State Park. In 2001 the city gave the park a 50-year lease on almost seven acres of the Chapman Gardens land, at no charge. Former City Administrator Betty Webb has noted that at the time of the lease, the city expected the park to save or replant Johnny Meyer Hill, which was an orchard, and perhaps build a Ranger House.
   
 The park never did that, and the historic Slave Quarters at the back of Orman House has collapsed through lack of care, too.
   
 I understand budget pressures, but we can't just wait for the others to improve the area. We must do our part.

During times like this (I hope I never see the likes of this again), it can be difficult to remember what we should be grateful for. I'm grateful for a roof over my head, food in my belly, good health and the good health of my loved ones and, hopefully, a thriving business when it's up and running again. I think it's important to pause in the midst of our busy lives, take a few deep breaths and experience the healing energy of gratitude -- to focus on the positive, not the negative, during the coronavirus.
 While we self isolate, take a look around at your family members. When will you have another opportunity to spend so much time with them? To give your full attention to your children and answer their questions and be fully present for these teachable moments. To lead by example (flip out in private, please) so that you reassure your kids that everything will be OK; different but OK.
 I hope that we, as a society, make the necessary changes so that we have a more equitable society -- housing, food, jobs, education and health care for everyone! A government that works for all of us, not just the advantaged. We, the people, can make this happen. We have the power with our votes!
 My wish for this holiday season is that we no longer turn a blind eye to all forms of injustice, from racism to income inequality. It's time to pull together and remember what binds us, not what separates us. We're all human, regardless of race, religion, political beliefs, etc. We all have similar needs -- to love and be loved, to work at something meaningful and to feel that our lives matter.
 I love reading stories about how so many people are pitching in to help their neighbors and others through this pandemic. I hope we don't forget what we've learned when our lives go forward to our new normal.
 I know how difficult it is to "look on the bright side of things" during a time of such uncertainty. For those of you suffering from depression, substance use disorder or other forms of mental illness, please know that there is help just a phone call or email away. Please reach out to those around you and let them know you're struggling. You are not alone.
 For those of you who believe in a higher power, prayer is very powerful. I can't stress enough about getting outside in the sun and fresh air. You don't even have to go for a walk; just sit outside in nature and take some deep breaths.
 A word about fostering and adopting a pet during this time. Only do it if you can take care of an animal's needs after you return to work. If you don't have the time, energy or finances to properly care for a pet going forward, please don't adopt. That cute animal depends on you for food, love, health care, etc. It's a responsibility to take care of another being (something like kids) and not something to do halfway.
 We have two cats (Coco and Lucy) and my precious Pomeranian, Teddy, inherited from my son (sometimes I prefer the dog to the adult child!). I've fallen totally in love with him and vice versa. I work from home so my pets get plenty of attention but that's not everyone's lifestyle.
 This is a good time to reach out to others while you're self isolating. I've been keeping in touch with people around the country (and I'm not on social media!). I call, text or email on a regular basis to make sure those I love are OK. Yes, it's time consuming, but well worth it.
 I'm enjoying this time where life is a little slower and I feel more connected to people than ever before. I will continue to keep in touch after life returns to a more hectic routine. I don't want to forget what I've learned during this time.
 Let's all move forward into the future more aware of those around us -- to offer a smile or a helping hand when needed. God bless.

Net leasing of office space fell 37 per cent during January- March period to nearly 7.4 million sq ft across eight major cities as corporates deferred their decision to hire workspace amid global economic slowdown caused by COVID-19, according to Cushman Wakefield. According to the data, the net absorption of office space declined to 73,98,041 sq ft during the first three months of this year from 1,16,55,242 sq ft in the corresponding period of the last year. The net absorption in Q1 2020 stands at 7.40 million sq ft, which is lower by 22.6 per cent on a quarterly basis and 36.5 per cent lower on a yearly basis as transaction slippage impacted the leasing momentum towards the end of the quarter, CW said in its quarterly report. The year started off with great momentum continuing from the last quarter of 2019. But by the end of Q1, the headwinds from global economic slowdown on the back of COVID-19 pandemic saw activity tapering off, said Anshul Jain, Managing Director South East Asia and India, CW. However, he expected the leasing activities to pick up later this year.

ATLANTA -- A national political fundraising committee endorsed Rep. Doug Collins' bid Wednesday to unseat his fellow Georgia Republican, Sen. Kelly Loeffler, in a November special election.
   
 The endorsement from Great America PAC comes after the recently appointed Loeffler faced scrutiny over stock transactions she made just before the coronavirus pandemic sent markets tumbling.
   
 The super PAC's chairman, Ed Rollins, made reference to those trades in a statement endorsing Collins.
   
 "In a very short time, Kelly Loeffler has proven she puts protecting her personal wealth well before protecting her constituents," Rollins said.
   
 Loeffler took her seat in the Senate in January after being appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to fill the seat of Sen. Johnny Isakson, who stepped down due to deteriorating health. A political newcomer, Loeffler soon drew opposition from within her own party from Collins, a four-term congressman who had actively sought the appointment to Isakson's former seat.
   
 The two Republicans are among more that 20 candidates running in a special election on Nov. 3 to fill the remaining two years of Isakson's term.
   
 The race won't be filtered by the normal party primaries, meaning all comers will be together on the November ballot. The crowded field significantly increases the odds that the race will be decided by a Jan. 5 runoff, required by state law if no candidate breaks 50% in November.
   
 Great America PAC calls itself as a "leading pro-Trump super PAC," but Loeffler spokesman Stephen Lawson questioned the group's connection to the president.
   
 "Doug Collins is actively touting support from a group that President Trump and his representatives have denounced?" Lawson said in an email. "That's a typical Washington politician for you."
   
 Trump, after initially lobbying for Collins to get the Senate appointment, has praised both Collins and Loeffler but has not made an endorsement in the race.
   
 GOP Rep. Drew Ferguson, who represents west Georgia's 3rd Congressional District, endorsed Collins on Monday, becoming the first member of Georgia's congressional delegation to openly break ranks with Loeffler by backing Collins.
   
 Loeffler and her husband, a wealthy businessman who is chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, offloaded parts of their portfolio and purchased new stocks, including shares in a chemical company that manufactures protective equipment, as Congress was receiving briefings on the growing threat of the pandemic.
   
 Loeffler has said she played no part in the trades, that they were managed by third-party advisers and that she has not attempted to profit from her time in the Senate. She also announced that she's selling her holdings in individual stocks to avoid political distraction.
   
 Top Democrats in the race include Raphael Warnock, pastor of the Atlanta church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached; Ed Tarver, a former federal prosecutor who was U.S. attorney for Georgia's Southern District under President Barack Obama; and Matt Lieberman, a former educator and the son of former vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman.

I had most of the sky before me; a canopy of stars visible from my so-called deck observatory on the back of my house. So what grabbed my attention? A couple of little patches of sky straight ahead of me on the horizon, peeking between the tree line in the back of the neighbor's field.      No craning of the neck this time!      Some of you may be graced with a clear, wide-open sky where you can pan the flat horizon all the way around in a circle. You must be living in the middle of a Midwestern ranch, on a mountain top or on a houseboat out at sea! Of course, a lot more people in rural areas are fortunate to have a really low view in the sky in at least one direction, or more than one.      Dodging trees, hills and buildings can be a challenge.      On the other hand, seeing the stars, planets and moon among the tree branches, when empty of leaves, can be very picturesque as one takes an evening stroll.      From the convenience of my backyard deck, I was thrilled to gaze with binoculars at those small gaps. I saw stars!      What was thrilling was looking due south at night, I was seeing a hint of far southern constellations, ones that never fully rise above my horizon at my latitude. These stars are wrapped in an air of mystery, an enticing invitation to want to head far south, the farther the better, as I round the Earth and see the southern stars slide higher and higher in my sky. There is a whole region of sky anyone of us above (or below) the equator can never see.      Using my star atlas, I identified those low stars in the wood line gaps as the brighter stars of the constellation Vela the Sail.      There's a good chance you northerners (like me) know very little, or maybe nothing, of Vela the Sail!      On trips to Florida and Haiti, I have had chances to see stars of the Southern Cross; Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our Sun; and a few other constellations and notable stars I can't see at home. Yet, way below the equator, such wonders as Octans the Octant, Dorado the Swordfish, Mensa the Fly and Telescopium the Telescope await being traced and enjoyed. Folks Downunder may feel the same mystique about the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, Cassiopeia and Camelopardalis the Giraffe, far northern star patterns hidden from them.      Note, our view low to the horizon also means we are looking through a thicker layer of atmosphere. Just like the sun is dimmer and redder at sunset/sunrise, the stars are dimmed at night along the horizon. Light pollution from populated areas past the horizon can create a bright glow low in the sky.      There is also an interesting aspect of the low stars near the horizon. Thanks to the Earth's atmosphere acting like a lens, the starlight is refracted, and appears a little higher in the sky than it would if we had no air (like on the moon). That means starlight right below our flat horizon is bent and comes into view! Refraction also makes the setting and rising sun and moon distorted.      The atmosphere is most turbulent at low angles, causing a star to "twinkle" and cause poor telescopic views of planets just rising or setting.      Knowing your latitude, with the help of a good star chart you can find the limit of how far down the sky you can see from your home.      Meanwhile, enjoy brilliant Venus in the evening western sky. New moon is on April 22.      Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

Alek Schulz, Community Economic Director, has been hard at work keeping up to speed on developments intended to aid struggling local businesses. He said: "The EDA and MCDC are currently doing a 90-day deferral on all of our active and current loans to try and give our businesses the option to take a breather from payments. Nothing will be added on top of what they owe; in the end we are extending their loan's maturity date by three months. Once the 90-day deferral period comes to an end, their payments will continue from where they left off."

The Manchester United star has been questioned leading into Brazil 2014, having been to two World Cups without scoring.
 That statistic annoys Rooney, 28, as Roy Hodgson's men prepare to face Uruguay, Italy and Costa Rica.
 Rooney said having no injury problems ahead of the tournament meant he was optimistic heading to Brazil.
 "I have always been honest with myself and the truth is that, while I've been lucky enough to win a lot of things with United, I do feel there is something missing in my career with England," he told the _Sunday Mirror_.
 "After the injury problems I have had in the build-up to my two previous World Cups, I really hope this can be my tournament.
 "I haven't scored at a World Cup yet and that's something I want to put right because it does wind me up.
 "I want to do better this time – not just for myself – but because I know that, if I am playing well, then I'll be helping the team."
 Rooney had special praise for his international team-mates, labelling the squad the best he has been involved with.
 But he said their inexperience could make a difference at the World Cup.
 "The one weakness is that we have a lot players who haven't got any real experience of tournament football," Rooney said.
 "I don't think anyone can predict what will happen to England in Brazil – and that's why I am really excited about this World Cup.
 "I've got absolutely no idea how we are going to perform.
 "We could have a massive impact on the tournament, go all the way to the final and surprise everyone. All I can say is that the potential and quality we have got in this squad is really exciting.
 "I look at lads like Daniel Sturridge, Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana and I can't help but be positive about what we can do.
 "It's mad because we've got so many good young players."
