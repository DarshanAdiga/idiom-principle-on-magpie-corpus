We are not sure how or why, but Apple had a change of heart and granted an indefinite extension to allow Epic Games to continue using its 'Sign in with Apple' API.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - President Donald Trump's decision to extend a ban on offshore drilling could give a boost to Republican senators in tough reelection races. South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Georgia's Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are all on the ballot and competing in states where governors have long opposed Trump's initial plans to expand drilling off their coasts.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden accused Trump of "conveniently" changing his mind as the election draws near.
