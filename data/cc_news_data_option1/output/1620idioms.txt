TAMPA — Aaron Boone is ready to move on.
 After MLB announced that the Red Sox players, managers, front office and owners did nothing wrong and dumped the blame for their illegal sign stealing at the foot of a previously anonymous video replay guy, the Yankees manager seemed to shrug and say it’s time for the sport to move on from the cheating scandals of the past three years.
 “Who knows exactly what went down. I do trust that MLB thoroughly investigated and got to the bottom of things as best they can. And feel like that’s what was come up with and so be it,” Boone told the YES Network’s Meredith Marakovits Thursday night. “You know, it’s time to move on and I’m glad that we’re kind of through those situations. Hopefully, as I’ve said all along and I do believe this, hopefully, as a sport we’ll be better moving forward and knowing that if you mess around, they’re coming for you and, and I think that’s a good thing.”

Claypool caught 66 passes for 1,037 yards and 13 touchdowns last year for Notre Dame. He joins an offense in search of another playmaker following an eventful 2019 when the Steelers finished 8-8 after losing Roethlisberger to a for the season at halftime of Week 2.
 “His production this past season was off the charts,” Fichtner said. “It’s been growing every season. He’s one of those guys that scores the ball. There’s ways to do it and he’s a guy that finds a way to score a touchdown in just about every game he plays.”
 Pittsburgh’s passing game struggled in 2019 after Roethlisberger went down at halftime of Week 2. The Steelers finished 31st in yards passing while bouncing between Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges a year after Roethlisberger won the NFL passing title.
 Roethlisberger is on schedule to play in 2020 and Claypool is the second big body to join the passing game in the last month. The Steelers signed tight end Eric Ebron to a two-year deal in free agency. Ebron can create mismatches on the inside. Claypool — who ran a 4.42 40-yard dash — can do the same on the outside.
 Claypool, who was raised in British Columbia, Canada, said he models himself after a handful of players, including Steelers wide receiver Juju Smith- Schuster. Smith-Schuster texted Claypool shortly after Pittsburgh selected him with the 49th overall pick and Roethlisberger made it a point to call the rookie to welcome him to town. Well, sort of.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-ARKANSASGroup casts doubt on Arkansas supplies as virus tests spikeLITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A hospital advocacy group has cast doubt on the availability of coronavirus testing supplies in Arkansas even as state officials announced a near tripling of tests completed in one day. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday said more than 2,800 coronavirus tests were completed a day earlier, when the state launched a two-day surge of tests. The Arkansas Hospital Association says it wasn't consulted about the surge plan before it was announced and that many of its members “continue to have issues around ongoing scarcity of test kits and other supplies.”ARKANSAS LEGISLATUREShepherd wins another term as Arkansas House speakerLITTLE ROCK, Ark.

Shepherd was first elected speaker in 2018 and has served in the House since 2011. The majority-Republican House re-elected him after the Legislature formally adjourned this year's session. The House met in a 5,600-seat basketball arena instead of the Capitol due to concerns about the coronavirus.ARKANSAS-INMATE ESCAPEInmate who escaped Arkansas jail brought back into custodyDES ARC, Ark.

Some days later, several of the disciples were back in Galilee fishing. Jesus not only came to where they were, but he fixed them breakfast. Several years after His ascension, the resurrected Jesus met and spoke with Saul of Tarsus (soon to become the apostle Paul) as he was traveling the road to Damascus.
 Here’s the point for us. While we aren’t meeting in our normal church buildings, at least until Friday, May 1 per Gov. Eric Holcomb’s “Stay-at-Home” order, while we’re hiding so-to-speak from COVID-19 and staying sheltered behind closed doors to keep from being infected by the virus or spreading it to others, Jesus is still ready to meet us wherever we are. If we’re gathered in His Name, He’s with us!
 Whether it’s in our living room, dining room, or patio; whether it’s at our kitchen table, on the couch, or at a bedside chair, Jesus will be there. As we sing songs of praise and lift our prayers and petitions, He’ll hear us.
 As we read the Word of God, the Scriptures will testify about Him and His Spirit will speak to us. The Holy Spirit was able to move through prison walls, come aboard ships which were far from shore, find believers on remote islands, and more. The Psalmist says that there’s no place away from the presence of God. He’ll show up at our house just fine.
 In Psalm 23, King David said, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.” The Lord Jesus Christ is doing that very thing for us now. The Lord’s Table can be set wherever we are and amidst whatever circumstances. Our present “enemy” is COVID-19, but we can remember Jesus through the loaf and the cup (cracker, grape juice) even as coronavirus lurks outside our closed doors. The Lord is with us; who and what can stand against us? We are more than overcomers and conquerors!
 Whether our family has several members, or whether it’s just one, the Scriptures reveal that Jesus does some of His best work with small groups and individuals.
 Another Sunday is upon us. Jesus is ready. “I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord (Psalm 122).” The Lord’s house is your house and my house. Remember what Jesus told Zacchaeus: “Hurry, I’m coming to stay at your house today!”
 Peace be with you, and the blessings of God be upon you. “And behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”

PLYMOUTH - It seems as though there has been a girl named Andrews excelling in athletics at Plymouth South for the past decade. Tayla Andrews, now 26, was a star soccer player who went on to play at UMass-Boston, where she is now in the college's athletic Hall of Fame. Jayci, 22, ran track and became a two- time NCAA hurdles champion at Bridgewater State. Jaiden, 20, was also an outstanding hurdler who went on to compete at UMass-Dartmouth.
 The latest in a line of star athletes is their youngest sister, Teja, who wound up her Panthers' basketball career last winter by leading the Patriot League in scoring, averaging 18 points-per-game.
 Andrews was held to single digits only twice all season, and scored more than 20 points in six games, despite being the sole focus of every opposing defense. Nearly every night, teams employed a box-and-one or triangle-and-two defense on her. Yet, she still found ways to score.
 "Abington ran a triangle-and-two and a box-and-one on her the entire game, and she still scored 22 points," Plymouth South Head Coach Matt DellaBarba said. "To be able to score while drawing that much attention makes it much more impressive."
 Early in the season, she poured in 23 against Pembroke, the eventual league champion. And North Quincy doubled her from the outset, prompting DellaBarba to have Andrews stand at midcourt and allow the Panthers to play 4-on-3.
 "That was frustrating," Andrews said. "But I was determined not to give up. I had to use my quickness [against all the different defenses] to get past them."
 DellaBarba said Andrews' ability to score in a variety of ways made her difficult to stop. "She can finish at the basket, has a nice elbow jump shot and can hit 3-pointers," he said. "She's ridiculously athletic, she's a hard worker and she has that mindset that she's not going to be denied."
 A three-time league all-star, Andrews finished her career with 972 points, playing every position on the court at different times. She was most comfortable as a shooting guard or small forward, which will likely be her role when she continues her basketball career at UMass-Dartmouth next winter. At 5-foot-8, she was also Plymouth South's best rebounder.
 The presence of her sisters at her games served as inspiration. "It made me want to get better," she said.
 Although the Panthers failed to qualify for the state tournament last winter, Andrews looks back fondly on her senior season. "Even though we didn't win that many games, everyone was positive and no one gave up," she said. "We kept on playing hard."
 DellaBarba said that Andrews' leadership on and off the court was a major reason the Panthers were in the hunt for a tournament berth up to the final week of the season.
 "Her attitude was incredible," he said. "She was a two-year captain and just an incredible leader. She was great with younger girls. No matter what the situation, she had a positive attitude, and that carried over to the rest of team."

CALEB NICKERSON   PONTIAC April 22, 2020   Staff at the local women’s shelter have seen an uptick in calls during the course of the COVID-19 distancing measures.   Ashley Nadeau, the coordinator of L’EntourElle, said while she can’t quantify the scale of the increase, staff are fielding more calls than usual.   “We’ve seen people are reaching out more,” she said. “A direct reach out. We do have a 24/7 crisis line and they are reaching out, for sure.”   Nadeau added that they’ve also had to adjust how they interact with the women who approach them for help. Since face to face meetings have been restricted, they’ve had to switch to more online and telephone communications.   “The service that we offered before was … women that aren’t ready to come into sheltering, we would go out in the community to meet with them, just to establish intervention plans and whatnot,” she explained. “But right now that’s not happening, so everything is done by telephone, all of our followups are still on but they’re just done by telephone.”   “It’s different now because our telephone followups are more frequent,” she continued. “Let’s say one particular file, I would be meeting with her every week or every second week, well it’s every second day I’m giving her a call right now, just checking in.”   If a woman suffering from domestic violence is unable to safely reach out by phone, Nadeau explained that they have been promoting methods of covertly seeking help during lockdown, such as putting a note in the mailbox or giving it to a trusted neighbour.   “If she’s having groceries delivered to her place, slip a note in the payment for the delivery guy, if you need to go to the pharmacy, deliver a note to the cashier or the cashier at the grocery store if you know that you are the one going out, stuff like that,” she said.   “We have informed those companies, the pharmacy and the grocery stores, they all have our information so that if a victim presents themselves at their cash, they know where to call and how to find us rapidly.”   Nadeau added that their shelter, which has nine places and is typically filled to capacity, has also had to implement different protocols to protect everyone’s health.   “We still do offer sheltering, that’s something that’s still going on,” she said. “We have measures put into place to ensure employee security, and resident’s security also.”   Quebec’s domestic violence crisis line is 1 800 363 9010.

The average sailor spends anywhere from a few weeks to several months on the Reagan without setting foot on land.

The Zoe feels vertiginously high after the Mini, almost SUV-like from behind the wheel. And while the flat seats are fine at a cruise, they offer little support as cornering forces grow. The Zoe clings on harder than you’d think but lifeless steering means it’s not exactly fun, although a lowish centre of gravity and decent body control allow you to scoot through bends with poise and pace.

Pressing demand for food worldwide has led to indiscriminate use of pesticides worldwide. Most of the pesticides used contain toxic or poisonous substances and their extensive use not just pollutes the soil and water but also makes the food unhealthy to consume. Repeated and too much use of such pesticides damages non-targeted areas for they usually spread over to the entire area under cultivation. Further, pesticides also get accumulated as residuals in running ground waters, thus bringing down soil fertility. Such negative impacts have made several authorities across the globe ban pesticides or limit their usage.

Finally, I suggest that pressure should be put on the authorities to build courts in or close to our existing large prisons so that trials of people awaiting trial in the prisons are carried out by both High Court Judges and Magistrates within the courts halls built in or around the prisons thereby doing away with having to transport the prisoners to Courts which may be far away from the prisons and, in most cases, the prison authorities might not have serviceable vehicles to do so. Efforts should also be made to revert to the old systems that worked well but were jettisoned without good reasons. It is also necessary toemphasise that the Judiciary holds the main role of instilling discipline into the society. This can be achieved by quick trials of people brought before the courtsfor breaches of the law, thereby preventing the manifestation of acts of impunity or rewarding lawlessness. Happily, results of some criminal trials recently published, led to convictions of some top politicians for fraud. These are indications that rushing into politics with a view to amassing wealth fraudulently may lead to severe results they never contemplated. The fact that there are many more of such cases still pending in the courts and many are yetto be filed, are indications that the courts can still successfully achieve its role of bringing sanity to our society. Similarly, the clamp down by the security agencies on a number of legal practitioners said to be involved in corrupting Judicial Officers, leading to some prosecutions, will definitely have the effect of ending or seriously curtailing that practice.

The Renault’s 338-litre boot is the biggest here, 27 litres up on the e-208, while occupants in the rear get more leg room than in the Mini. What they don’t benefit from is head room, again due to a high-set rear bench forced by the battery under the floor. This extends to the front seats, meaning you’re sitting on rather than in the Zoe. On the flipside, the elevated view makes the Renault the most assured choice in the urban cut and thrust.

That was the equalizer, but the inequalities also hit home almost immediately. As India went quiet and millions snuck into their homes to wait out the lockdown, migrant workers and daily wagers, stranded miles away from home, stared at an uncertain future without money, food, or jobs. Most middle and upper-class families found it challenging to spend so much time with their immediate families, and many isolated without them spiraled into depression. The journey of getting used to a new way of life - without domestic help, without the necessity of dressing up to step out and just staying cooped up indoors -- has been out of the ordinary, equal parts good, bad, and ugly.

Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, said that some legislators’ notion that families don’t depend on minimum wage is a myth.
 “I’m glad they acknowledge that there are people in Virginia who cannot live off minimum wage,” Guzman said. “Actually, what they do is they get a second job, or a third job in order to make ends meet.” Guzman immigrated to the U.S. from Peru at the age of 18 and worked three jobs to afford a one bedroom apartment.
 The House of Delegates voted 49-45 to accept Northam’s amendment to their bill. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax made the tie-breaking Senate vote when its version ended in a 20-20 tie.
 The identical bills, introduced by Sen. Saslaw and Del. Jeion Ward, D-Hampton, originally would have raised the state’s minimum wage from $7.25 to $9.50 per hour on Jan. 1, 2021. The governor’s amendment pushes the start to May 1, 2021.
 The wage will then increase to $11 in 2022, $12 in 2023 and by another $1.50 in 2025 and 2026. Every subsequent year the bill is to be re-amended to adjust the minimum wage to reflect the consumer price index.
 Virginia’s cost of living index is very close to the national average, but it ranks in the top four among states where the minimum wage equals the federal rate of $7.25, according to an analysis of data from the Missouri Economic Research and Development Center.
 Anna Scholl, executive director of Progress Virginia, said now is not the time for Virginia to turn its back on low wage workers.
 “We have been fighting for a decade to push for people who are working hard to make ends meet, to support their families and to be able to do so with dignity,” Scholl said. “That’s what raising the minimum wage is about.”

You can encourage birds to visit your garden by being sure there is something for them to eat. The easy way to do this is to add a bird feeder to your yard. To attract a variety of birds, fill your feeder with a seed mix that includes large and small seeds. Some birds, such as finches, will search out a specific type of seed. So if you want finches in your yard, you will need to get a feeder that is built for thistle.
 However, you can transition from a feeder to a natural source of food by planting fruit or seed-bearing plants. Sunflowers are the first that come to mind. Tomatoes are another one if you are willing to share your tomatoes with the birds.
 Some flowers are beautiful, like forsythia or lilac. However, they don’t provide any food. Instead, for your bird sanctuary, you might want to consider a holly, whose berries are always a bird favorite.
 Keeping your lawn healthy and vibrant is another attractor to birds in that healthy lawns encourage worms, and robins, mockingbirds and flickers all love worms.
 Water is important for birds, just like humans. Typically, we think of a bird bath as a water source; however, water features, such as fountains, are also appropriate as long as they have a shallow area of no more than 2 inches. If you do have a bird bath, be sure to place a small rock in there to give them a place to stand. And remember, a standalone bird bath will need to be washed out every three to four days and disinfected with bleach once or twice a year.

The price of Venezuelan oil has fallen to below $10 a barrel -- its lowest level in more than two decades, the government said on Friday.
 The oil ministry said the price between Monday and Friday was 70.62 Chinese yuan -- $9.90 a barrel -- a level that has not been seen since 1998 when it was $9.28.
 Since 2017, the government of President Nicolas Maduro has announced its oil prices in yuan rather than dollars in protest over US sanctions.
 The weekly price -- last year averaging $56.70 and at $61.41 in 2018 -- has fallen through the floor since the coronavirus pandemic began.
 Oil prices have been sliding since 2014 and exacerbating the country's ongoing economic crisis that has pushed almost five million Venezuelans to leave the country, according to UN figures.
 Venezuela is almost entirely dependent on its oil revenues, which account for around 96 percent of its income.
 "It is an extremely extreme situation," oil expert Francisco Monaldi said this week in a meeting with the country's Foreign Press Association.
 "Venezuela would normally need prices of more than $30 to make it attractive to continue drilling and pay royalties," he said.
 "What we are experiencing is a kind of Armageddon."
 Venezuela's oil production has fallen to around a quarter of its 2008 level.
 Maduro's government blames that on US sanctions, including against state oil company PDVSA, but many analysts say the regime has failed to invest in or maintain infrastructure.
 Although the South American country has the largest oil reserves in the world, the sector is a victim of corruption and lack of investment, according to analysts and the Venezuelan opposition.
 Between 2004 and 2015, the country earned $750 billion from its oil exports, the price of which peaked in 2011 and 2012 with an annual barrel average of $101.06 and $103.42 respectively.
 But now, the government is running the printing press to make up for the budget deficit -- and fueling runaway inflation.
 Despite a national lockdown because of the coronavirus, protests have bubbled up across the country as people experience shortages of food and medical necessities.
 Officials said several dozen people had demonstrated in Upata, a town of about 100,000 inhabitants, while seven people were injured Wednesday during protests -- that turned to looting -- in the eastern state of Sucre.
 At least 10 people have died from COVID-19 in Venezuela, with just over 300 infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Wadding up one of the bread slices; I peeked over the fence and threw it in the direction of the little raccoon. The bread landed about two feet behind the little rascal, and I almost burst out laughing as I saw it stop, stand up on its back legs and sniff. Suddenly it spun around and rushed to the piece of bread. It scooped the bread up in both front paws and looked at it like, “How did I miss this choice morsel?”
 The little raccoon gobbled the bread down. When it was finished, I threw the other slice and simply said, “I’ve got your bread.”
 At the sound of my voice, the little raccoon shot across the yard and into the safety of the brushy mill race. Standing there, I patiently watched until I saw a small pair of eyes peeking around the branches of the nearest tree. It was keeping an eye on me and watching another piece of bread on the ground.
 I went back in the house, and in a few minutes when I looked, the second slice of bread had disappeared.
 The next afternoon, the scenario was repeated. But this time, the little raccoon didn’t scamper up the tree when I said, “I’ve got your bread.” It stopped at the edge of cover and peeked out at me through the weeds.
 Over the next few days, my encounter with the little raccoon came closer and closer. Even to the point, I could open the gate and it would very hesitantly let me approach to within just a few feet.
 My next tactic was to get as close as possible, kneel down, hold out my hand and say, “I’ve got your bread.” Slowly, the little critter got braver and kept coming closer and closer.
 In the following couple of days, I would kneel down; hold out my hand and say, “I’ve got your bread. But you are going to have to come and get it.”
 I was amazed as the little fellow came within inches of my outstretched hand. I could see it quivering and shaking from fear at the huge creature offering it something to eat. I finally tossed the bread the couple of feet to the little coon.
 The following evening, I held my ground until the little guy came up and after several minutes of a standoff, very carefully approached, took its two paws and lifted the bread from my hand. As soon as it had the bread in its mouth, it shot over to the safety of the brushy cover. What an incredible experience!
 The ten days or so of supplemental feeding was enough to get the little guy “out of the woods.”
 No pun intended, and it was the last time I saw the little critter.

The first round of the 2020 NFL Draft is in the books!
   
 After a drama-less start, things picked up in a big way. Out-of-nowhere picks, trades and uncertainty filled the night. While it will take years to truly assess which players are best and which picks turn out to look prescient, no one has that kind of time to wait on an opinion.
   
 Here are the instant reaction winners and losers of the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft.
   
 Arizona Cardinals
   
 Clemson's Isaiah Simmons has the tools to be a superstar on the defensive side and total game changer. There's no reason he should have lasted until the No. 8 overall pick.
   
 Jerry Jones
   
 The best wide receiver in the draft at No. 17? Jones and the Cowboys got one of the steals of the night, and ensured Oklahoma's CeeDee Lamb didn't slip down to the division rival Eagles. A passing attack with Amari Cooper, Lamb and Michael Gallup will be dynamic.
   
 San Francisco 49ers
   
 John Lynch just put on a master class of moving around the board. The 49ers landed the No. 13 pick for DeForest Buckner when free agency began, dropped down one slot to No. 14 to improve mid-round capital, landed the best interior pass rusher (South Carolina's Javon Kinlaw) in the draft, then shot up the board to land a yards after catch monster in Arizona State's Brandon Ayiuk. This roster remains loaded.
   
 Baltimore Ravens
   
 LSU linebacker Patrick Queen is the NFL's next great middle-of-the-defense star, and it didn't even take a trade up to land him.
   
 Andy Reid
   
 Pop on a highlight of LSU running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire. The Super Bowl- winning Chiefs head coach may have his new Brian Westbrook.
   
 Vikings
   
 LSU's Justin Jefferson and TCU's Jeff Gladney give a win-now team two polished college stars. The Vikings' window to win a Super Bowl remains open.
   
 Dave Gettleman
   
 This was the draft to trade down, or take a bold swing on Simmons. Gettleman did neither, and continued to leave the defense high and dry.
   
 Aaron Rodgers
   
 The end in Green Bay is near for the Packers star. Rodgers is the same age now that Brett Favre was when the Packers took him. Enter Utah State's Jordan Love. He'll play sooner than you think.
   
 Andre Dillard
   
 The day started with more trade rumors surrounding the young Eagles left tackle. It ended with having to block Chase Young twice per season. Not ideal!
   
 Miami Dolphins
   
 Tua Tagovailoa is overrated and injury prone. The Dolphins took a huge risk with the No. 5 pick. At least it didn't require a trade up!

Early Sunday morning, the Spirit of the Living God entered that tomb, reanimated the body of Jesus, and the resurrected Lord walked out of the grave victorious over sin, death and Satan. “He is risen!” said the angel.
 Later that same Sunday, 10 disciples were hidden and locked away behind closed doors “for fear of the Jews” and in fear of their lives. But locked doors are no problem for Jesus. He “came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.’”
 Jesus ministered to them; He strengthened and encouraged them. And “the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.”
 One week later, 11 disciples — including Thomas this time — were again behind locked doors. And just like the Sunday prior, locked doors were no problem for the King of kings and Lord of lords. Jesus came specifically that day for one person: Thomas.
 “Put your fingers here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.” Thomas could only answer, “My Lord and my God!”

Cincinnati’s in the red zone, and the Texans have held them without a touchdown all game. The ball is snapped and big No. 90 fires off the line. He bull rushes Jones to the left, then, just as Jones readjusts for leverage, Williams shoves him with his left arm, swims over him with his right and tomahawks Fitzgerald from behind, chopping the ball out of his hand and creating a pile of bodies squirming for the pigskin. When it’s clear the Texans have the ball, Williams pumps both fists in the air. After almost three quarters of football, he did it. He beat Jones. He beat the Bengals’ line. He got to the quarterback and got his sack, with a forced fumble to boot. The crowd is going wild.

Such wages are typical in the depressed Gazan economy, but would barely keep a family afloat. It costs around $250 a month to rent a two-bedroom apartment.
 Omar Shaban, an economist who heads a local think tank, said the conditions created by the blockade allow for “exploitation,” but that low-wage jobs still provide income for many people.
 Unipal 2000 first opened in an industrial zone along the frontier in 1998, when the peace process was in full swing. But like many other Gaza businesses, it was forced to shut down after the Hamas takeover and the blockade. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas, an Islamic militant group that opposes Israel’s existence, from arming itself.
 Israel began easing some restrictions after the 2014 Gaza war, and the factory reopened two years later. But by then most of its clients had found suppliers elsewhere, so it only operated intermittently.

Footballers in France's top flight will return to their clubs the week starting May 11 to undergo "full medical checkups" with a view to restarting Ligue 1 in June pending government clearance, the French league (LFP) has said. The LFP board met to review the main points of a draft document on medical and health protocols presented by the league's representative for club doctors, it said in a statement.
 The document "foresees a return of players to training centres the week of May 11 to carry out full medical checkups, as well as swab tests, followed by daily monitoring, which will be detailed ... between now and the end of April," it said. The LFP has also indicated its preferred option remains a "resumption of leagues in mid-June subject to knowing the terms of easing confinement measures which will be presented by the government in the coming days".
 France is currently under a nationwide lockdown until May 11. The LFP also reached an agreement with broadcasters Canal Plus and beIN Sports on Friday over disputed payments.
 The two television companies withheld money due after the league was suspended indefinitely. A statement from the LFP said they had agreed to pay an amount relative to the number of matches already broadcast. French sports daily L'Equipe reported the sum from Canal Plus to be around 37 million euros ($40 million).
 Meanwhile, French football federation president Noel Le Graet hopes both the French Cup and League Cup finals can be played before the league season restarts. Paris Saint-Germain are due to meet Saint-Etienne in the French Cup, while Thomas Tuchel's side are scheduled to face Lyon in the League Cup.

India went under lockdown to stem the spread of coronavirus on March 25 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement the evening before. In the days since, 1.3 billion Indians, wealthy and poor, in the heartland and distant corners, have faced up to the fear of a pandemic spreading across the globe. No one was spared the anxiety of the lockdown, extended till May 3, that kept most of India behind closed doors, not corporate biggies in gilded mansions, not the middle class inside their homes and not part-time domestic workers in claustrophobic tenements.

Feeling positive about his future for the first time in ages, Tone decides to stop taking the mystery meds his dad prescribed in the wake of his breakdown – unaware Edward had tampered with them as part of his plan to permanently put his son out of the picture. Has the damage already been done by the drugs? And with his precious daughter now a permanent fixture, how long before evil Edward shows his face again?

“This is welcome news to many of our businesses who in more ways than one make our community unique,” Emsweller said. “Over the last month, the Chamber has spoken with many of them and we know the need is real and becomes more critical as time marches on. While this is a start, we know we have a long way to go and we know big efforts are underway locally to restore our community. The Chamber encourages everyone to do their part by supporting and buying from local businesses.”
 Many local businesses can be found in downtown Greensburg on Main Street. Main Street Greensburg Executive Director Susan Burkhart said COVID-19 has had a “huge” impact on the city’s small businesses and how they operate.
 “This revolving loan will help alleviate some of the financial struggles our Main Street has suffered, and help prepare them for the future,” Burkhart said.
 According to OCRA, in March, Gov. Eric Holcomb issued Executive Order 20-05 that allowed the OCRA to redirect Community Development Block Grant funds to assist with COVID-19 needs based on guidance from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). On April 1, the COVID-19 Response Program launched and, over the course of two weeks, received 108 Letters of Need, totaling an estimated $23 million in requests, the state department said.
 “After setting up weekly calls with our local elected officials and Main Street organizations, I was able to hear how quickly we needed to provide funding to assist with rising medical needs and to save jobs and small businesses,” Lt. Governor Crouch said. “Our rural communities are truly the next economic frontier and we have to do all we can to ensure they survive this crisis.”
 Officials from OCRA offered a similar sentiment.
 “Our rural communities are feeling the effects of COVID-19 and need immediate support to ensure that critical services and supplies, as well as economic recovery resources are available,” Jodi Golden, Executive Director of OCRA, said. “These are the first of many projects we hope to fund through this new program.”
 The city says more information, requirements, details and the application process will soon be made available as guidelines are established.
 The Daily News will provide more information as it becomes available.

 The first round of the 2020 NFL Draft is in the books!
 After a drama-less start, things picked up in a big way. Out-of-nowhere picks, trades and uncertainty filled the night. While it will take years to truly assess which players are best and which picks turn out to look prescient, no one has that kind of time to wait on an opinion.
 Here are the instant reaction winners and losers of the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft.
 Arizona Cardinals
 Clemson's Isaiah Simmons has the tools to be a superstar on the defensive side and total game changer. There's no reason he should have lasted until the No. 8 overall pick.
 Jerry Jones
 The best wide receiver in the draft at No. 17? Jones and the Cowboys got one of the steals of the night, and ensured Oklahoma's CeeDee Lamb didn't slip down to the division rival Eagles. A passing attack with Amari Cooper, Lamb and Michael Gallup will be dynamic.
 San Francisco 49ers
 John Lynch just put on a master class of moving around the board. The 49ers landed the No. 13 pick for DeForest Buckner when free agency began, dropped down one slot to No. 14 to improve mid-round capital, landed the best interior pass rusher (South Carolina's Javon Kinlaw) in the draft, then shot up the board to land a yards after catch monster in Arizona State's Brandon Ayiuk. This roster remains loaded.
 Baltimore Ravens
 LSU linebacker Patrick Queen is the NFL's next great middle-of-the-defense star, and it didn't even take a trade up to land him.
 Andy Reid
 Pop on a highlight of LSU running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire. The Super Bowl- winning Chiefs head coach may have his new Brian Westbrook.
 Vikings
 LSU's Justin Jefferson and TCU's Jeff Gladney give a win-now team two polished college stars. The Vikings' window to win a Super Bowl remains open.
 Dave Gettleman
 This was the draft to trade down, or take a bold swing on Simmons. Gettleman did neither, and continued to leave the defense high and dry.
 Aaron Rodgers
 The end in Green Bay is near for the Packers star. Rodgers is the same age now that Brett Favre was when the Packers took him. Enter Utah State's Jordan Love. He'll play sooner than you think.
 Andre Dillard
 The day started with more trade rumors surrounding the young Eagles left tackle. It ended with having to block Chase Young twice per season. Not ideal!
 Miami Dolphins
 Tua Tagovailoa is overrated and injury prone. The Dolphins took a huge risk with the No. 5 pick. At least it didn't require a trade up!
 Sam Darnold
 The young Jets quarterback better hope his general manager, Joe Douglas, is right about Louisville left tackle Mekii Becton. His career depends on it.

In This Day newspaper publication of Tuesday 24 March, 2020 (Lawyer Pull-out page 5), it is reported that Mr. Femi Falana, SAN, said that “all election petitions and pre-election matters should be handled by retired Judges”. He went further to say that “doing this would help the courts, which have been turned into a theatre of war by politicians.” The learned SAN was said to have made the observation in the second annual memorial lecture he delivered in honour of that distinguished lawyer, late Pa Tunji Gomez, at the foyer of the High Court, Igbosere, Lagos, the previous Wednesday. Mr. Femi Falana SAN, is not just a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, he is a no-nonsense top Silk whose views and pronouncements carry much weight having regard to his very deep knowledge of the law, frank views on national issues and someone who is well known for his fearless defence of the down trodden. His views on any matter therefore are bound to be taken very seriously. But the question of how the decision on the current practice of using serving Judges (and magistrates) to try election petitions and pre-election matters was arrived at was not a legal matter and as such a brilliant lawyer may not necessarily know it.

Born and raised in Easton, he was the son of the late Manuel and Piedade (Vieira) Abreu. Raymond was a 1954 graduate of Oliver Ames High School, where among many activities, he played four years of varsity basketball, and worked as a "soda jerk" at OConnors newsstand on Main Street. Post high school, he attended Suffolk University and Bentley College, earning degrees in Accounting and Finance. He served in the US Army in post-war Korea and was stationed in Seoul. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, he worked in finance at AVCO, Raytheon, General Electric, Family Services of Boston, and the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital. He completed his career working for many years at Walter Earl Chevrolet in Bridgewater. Raymond was a fan of all Boston sports and especially loved the Patriots as a season ticket holder since the early 90s. While his children were growing up, he coached in the Easton Church Basketball League for 13 years. He was an avid bowler and enjoyed golfing late into his life. Raymond also loved walking the beach and spending time at the Gurnet cottage in Plymouth. He is survived by his sons, Raymond Abreu, Jr. of Naples, FL and Larry Abreu and wife Beth (Dyer) Abreu of Easton; a daughter, Michele Abreu of Ft. Myers, FL; and grand- daughters Kaitlyn and Rebecca Abreu of Easton. He was the brother of James Abreu of Narragansett, RI and the late Albert Abreu, Isabel Barry, Bertha Abreu and Mary OConnell.

The Daily Record reports that Miss Gemmell turned to police when she realised she had, while not knowing about his crimes and sentencing, allowed Mr Sinclair to stay with her on “at least 12 separate occasions” between June and August last year.
 Mr Sinclair was subsequently put back behind bars after pleading guilty at Glasgow Sheriff Court to breaching his license terms by not disclosing he had stayed at a different address for more than seven nights during a 12 month period.
 Chillingly, Mr Sinclair has detailed how he intended to commit rape in 2005.
 The predator was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 2001 for rape with the final three years of his sentence released on license – which he then breached by raping a 24-year-old prostitute in Glasgow in 2005.
 He told police: "I was having a bad day. I wanted to do it. I thought it out before going out."
 Now that he is behind bars again, his 17-year conviction that he was handed in 2006 won’t be extended as Sheriff Swanson passed a four-month concurrent sentence on him.

The 1999 Constitution established the National Judicial Council (NJC) which is empowered, among others, to discipline all Judicial officers in the country. That body has in fact disciplined many Judges found wanting, particularly in their handling of election cases. Retired Judicial officers are not covered by the disciplinary powers conferred on the NJC. If therefore, the retired Judicial Officers are brought back to handle election petitions, their misconducts could not be brought before the NJC. I had the privilege of serving as a member of the NJC for 5 years since my retirement from the Supreme Court bench. During that period, I took part in many of the in-house trials of Judicial officers accused of misconduct. What I discovered was that most of the Judicial Officers were very conscious of the disciplinary powers of the NJC and would, as much as possible, conduct themselves in such a manner that would not lead them to being dragged before the Council. I therefore believe that there is totally no reason to do away with the present practice by calling on retired Judicial Officers to take over their role. The reason for the request by Mr. Falana was to avoid the court being “turned into a theatre of war by politicians”. Under the present system, the NJC is available to discipline any panel that would allow its panel to be unnecessarily “turned into a theatre of war”. But that role may not be available to NJC if the panels are made up of retired Judicial Officers who are no longer under the disciplinary control of the NJC. Anotherimportant point to be considered is that it may be impossible to find enough retired Judicial officers who are still fit and capable of coping with the number of election petitions that now arise from the elections in Nigeria. The present system should therefore be allowed to continue.

La riunione andata in scena tra Liga, Federcalcio Spagnola e Governo (rappresentato dal Consiglio Superiore dello Sport) ha delineato le fasi che porteranno al ritorno al calcio giocato nel Paese iberico. Le attività dovrebbero riprendere il 4 maggio, data in cui dovrebbero cominciare le prime sedute di allenamento individuale o in piccoli gruppi, ma già il 27 aprile potrebbero essere effettuati i primi test sugli atleti. In seguito, dall'11 maggio, si estenderebbero gli allenamenti a gruppi più grandi, per poi tornare al completo una settimana più tardi. L'idea è di ricominciare a giocare nella terza settimana di giugno, quindi di svolgere una preparazione di un mese e finire la stagione entro agosto. Da parte del sindacato dei calciatori, però, ci sono delle remore e il giocatore del Cadice, Fali, ha dichiarato di non essere intenzionato a tornare fino a che la situazione non sarà sicura al 100%. Intanto, la RFEF, si è già sbilanciata nel caso il campionato non dovesse ricominciare: verrà cristallizzata la classifica al momento della sospensione definitiva, che vedrebbe pertanto il Barcellona campione.

The escalation of coronavirus is making excessive usage of hospital medical billing in medical health. There has been a deficiency of almost every protective equipment, be it sanitizers and gloves to secure rooms and browsing networks. At the end of the day, the truth hurts. The economy and hospital billing companies become more and more fragile to meet the requirements of patients, as this pandemic escalates at a high frequency. The hospital medical billing systems are extremely volatile to these increasing requirements until and unless there is an increase in the usage of digital operating modules.

 Tulsa sits at approximately 400,000.
 “I have faith that Tulsa County leaders will quickly identify and respond to the most urgent needs in our community while assisting with long-term economic recovery,” Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said.
 Peters said the county hasn’t shut the door on allocating funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security — or CARES — Act to cities within the county but that it will not do so until it has clear instructions from the Treasury Department that it is permissible.
 “We have sent letters to the Treasury Department and Tulsa County District Attorney’s Office seeking further guidance about other entities that we can possibly give to down the road,” Peters said.
 The $2.2 trillion CARES Act was approved by Congress in late March. The measure includes funding for a wide range of COVID-19 relief efforts, including individual payments to American households, funding for the Public Broadcasting System and loans for large businesses.
 The Treasury Department is allocating the funds to states based on their population. Oklahoma, with its population of 3.9 million people, has 12% of the nation’s population, making it eligible to receive $1.53 billion, according to Treasury Department documents.

 Los Angeles Times
   
 (TNS) -- For a sport based largely on running away from others, it makes sense that track and field has taken social distancing to a new level.
   
 A Norwegian promoter announced Thursday that he will proceed with plans for a major meet in June by modifying several events to accommodate for COVID-19 restrictions.
   
 That means keeping two pole vaulters safely apart as they take turns, with a third competing by video from his backyard in France.
   
 It means no more than two or three runners per race, leaving room for empty lanes between them.
   
 Several competitors will go it alone, one of them aided by lights flickering along the inside of the track. Picture a greyhound chasing a mechanical rabbit.
   
 "You have two options," meet director Steinar Hoen said in a statement. "You can resign or look at the possibilities."
   
 The Bislett Games are part of the Diamond League circuit -- the NFL of international track and field -- which has postponed eight meets through the first three months of the season. Hoen refused to become the ninth, changing the framework of his June 11 event in Oslo and changing its name, temporarily, to the Impossible Games.
   
 The international track federation has dubbed it "alternative athletics," pledging to contribute $50,000 toward prize money.
   
 "This is really positive news for athletes and fans," said Sebastian Coe, the federation's president. "Congratulations to the Oslo Bislett Games for dreaming this up and following it through, working within the pandemic guidelines set out in Norway."
   
 The Scandinavian country has reported 7,361 cases and 193 deaths related to COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University. One of the first in Europe to institute a lockdown, it has also announced plans to ease restrictions "little by little."
   
 Hoen devised his unusual meet after consulting with local and national officials and agreeing to bar spectators from the stadium.
   
 "We have … confirmed a concept well within the government's infection-control requirements," he said.
   
 The scaled-down lineup of seven or so events will feature a trio of throwers in discus and three pole vaulters, including world record-holder Mondo Duplantis and Renaud Lavillenie in his yard in Perignat-les-Sarlieve.
   
 "A great initiative," Lavillenie said on social media.
   
 Solo races will include Norwegian star Karsten Warholm in the rarely run 300-meter hurdles and Karoline Bjerkeli Grovdal accompanied by technology that has lights advancing along the inside of the track at record pace in the 3,000 meters.
   
 Other events might be added between now and June.
   
 "The athletes are hungry for competitions," Hoen stated. "And we want to give them a high-class event."

As the number of positive cases neared 1,000 in Telangana, an Inter- Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) has reached Hyderabad on Saturday to take stock of the corona virus situation and monitor the lockdown process in the state. The central team is visiting the state in accordance with the Disaster Management Act.
 Each team will have eight members including a senior public health specialist and a senior officer of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). These teams will monitor hotspot areas, asess health infrastructure, disaster management and provide additional assistance to states. The task force team will review the hospitalisation facilities in the state, preparation of the state in terms of available beds, ramping up the number of hospitals and care centres dedicated to Covid-19 management.
 The central team will review the facilities at the Gachibowli Covid-19 hospital, Gandhi Hospital and other medical facilities set up by the Telangana government. The team will assess the level of testing, availability of PPE and masks for health professionals, availability of oxygen beds, ICUs, number of surveillance teams. The team will submit a detailed report on the situation in the state following which a central plan of action will be suggested to further contain the virus. After the assessment, the team will issue necessary directions to the Telangana government for redressal.
 The central government has already sent inter-ministerial teams to monitor certain hotspot districts in four states – Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.
 On Friday, 13 fresh cases of were reported in Telangana, taking the tally to 983. The number of active cases stands at 663. The virus has so far claimed 25 lives in the state.
