Quite obviously, there’s going to be some difference in battery life for the Apple Watch GPS and GPS + Cellular. The Apple Watch GPS uses Bluetooth to connect to your iPhone and the GPS is used when you’re out and about for navigational purposes. The Cellular model connects to the internet by LTE if you're not at home, so it’s quite understandable that it might have lesser battery life.  
   
 Let’s dig into this a bit more. We can see specifics on Apple’s battery test. Apple has tested the newly-released Apple Watch Series 6 battery life like that: all the usage for the Apple Watch Series 6 GPS was done with the Watch paired to an iPhone via Bluetooth during the entire 18-hour test. The Apple Watch Series 6 GPS + Cellular was paired via Bluetooth for 14 out of 18 hour- long test and for 4 hours it was on its own with its LTE connection. Same test was performed on the Apple Watch SE too.

BEIJING (AP) — TikTok’s owner said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license as it tries to complete a deal with Oracle and Walmart to keep the popular video app operating in the United States.Beijing tightened control over technology exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington’s attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.President Donald Trump said this week he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. Trump said Oracle must have “total control.” ByteDance said it applied to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce for an export license and was awaiting a reply. The one-sentence statement gave no other details.Chinese authorities have not indicated whether they will agree to a transfer of technology. But official newspapers criticized the proposed deal this week as bullying and extortion. “China has no reason to give the green light to such a deal, which is dirty and unfair,” said the newspaper China Daily on Wednesday. On Thursday, the foreign ministry said China will “take necessary measures” to safeguard its companies but gave no indication what steps it can take to affect TikTok’s fate in the United States. A ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, called on Washington to “respect the principles of market economy and fair competition” and “provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment” for foreign companies.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The weather pattern has been dominated by cloudy cover and some occasional rain. Deeper tropical moisture associated with the remnants of Beta will begin to stream into our portion of the Gulf Coast. This will lead to a trend of higher rain chances. Showers will be possible during the mornings, but the chance of isolated storms will arrive later in the day. The best rain chances will lie west of I-65. Highs will climb into the upper 70s and low 80s. The chance for showers and thunderstorms iwll continue through tonight as deeper moisture continues surging in. Shower and storms chances will peak Thursday. Storms will be likely, but a few of the storms could become strong with gusty winds, frequent lightning, and downpours. Also, isolated severe storms can't be ruled out. If a storm were to become severe tomorrow the main concern would be straight-line winds, but a couple of brief tornadoes can't be completely ruled out. Be WEATHER AWARE tomorrow. Highs will reach the lower 80s with morning lows in the lower 70s.

ANGRY, DISAPPOINTED
 Within a few days, Ken Vicino said he became sick and arranged to be tested. His result came back positive, as well, he said. He said he is now recuperating from the COVID-19 contagion.
 But he said he is angry and disappointed there was no requirement that students who had earlier tested negative at the campus be re-tested before they could be released from quarantine and before returning to their homes.
 “They shouldn’t have released these kids, No. 1,” he said. “No. 2, if they were going to release thousands of kids back to communities, they should have done another test because it takes three or four days after the exposure for you to become positive. They should have at least quick-tested them to see if they had it or not.”
 About a week before she returned home, he said, his daughter participated in a pool test for coronavirus at the campus, and that showed no sign of the virus in the saliva samples collected from that group of students.
 After the result came back a couple of days later, he said, she spent three days in quarantine.
 ‘HANDLED WRONG’
 If she was not infected at the time of the pool test, there was ample time for her to become infected by the time of the trip home, Vicino said.
 “It was absolutely handled wrong,” the father said. “For months, we had been listening to Governor (Andrew) Cuomo talking about the importance of testing, testing testing, and the importance of science, science, science. But when this happened, everything that happened was the exact opposite of what they were telling us for six months.”
 Vicino said he was treated at a hospital near his home for one day and is now recuperating. His daughter has recovered. He said his wife, an elementary school teacher, had to stay home the first two weeks of the school year due to quarantine rules.
 “For a blunder this big to happen this many months into what has been going on is ridiculous,” he said.
 Vicino said he questions why state officials emphasized the need to follow public health guidance, yet did not adhere to the recommendations of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert.
 In a Sept. 2 interview on NBC’s “Today’ show, Fauci said sending students home after they may have been exposed to virus-infected individuals is “the worst thing you could do.”
 “When you send them home, particularly when you’re dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection,” Fauci said.
 HEAD OF UUP
 CNHI reported earlier this month SUNY administrators in Albany gave the green light to the Oneonta campus reopening plan, as well as most other SUNY campuses, despite the fact they did not require the pre-testing of students when the semester began.
 The head of the United University Professionals (UUP) faculty union, Otsego County Board of Representatives Chairman Dave Bliss and Oneonta Mayor Gary Herzig had all advocated that the reopening plan include a requirement students be tested upon arriving on campus.

BOSTON -- Four former eBay Inc. employees have agreed to plead guilty to their roles in a campaign of intimidation that included sending live spiders and cockroaches to the home of a Massachusetts couple who ran an online newsletter critical of the auction site, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
 "Four former employees of #eBay are scheduled to plead guilty on Oct. 8 at 2pm via zoom in federal court in #Boston. The defendants are charged w/ participating in a cyberstalking campaign that targeted a Massachusetts couple," according to a tweet by U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling's office.
 The four expected to plead guilty are Brian Gilbert, 51; Stephanie Popp, 32; Stephanie Stockwell, 26; and Veronica Zea, 26, according to The Boston Globe.
 • Natick couple was targeted for months by 6 then-eBay employees. The employees face federal charges after an 'extensive' campaign of harassment.
 All live in San Jose, California, except for Stockwell, who lives in Redwood City, California.
 They are among seven former eBay employees charged in the case, in which the Massachusetts couple had other disturbing items sent to their home, including a funeral wreath and a bloody pig Halloween mask.
 They are all charged with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with a witness. Their lawyers either declined to comment or didn't immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.
 The employees also sent pornographic magazines with the husband's name on them to their neighbor's house, planned to break into the couple's garage to install a GPS device on their car, and posted the couple's names and address online, advertising things like yard sales and encouraging strangers to knock on the door if the pair wasn't outside, officials said.
 The suspects engaged in a "systematic campaign fueled by the resources of a Fortune 500 company to emotionally and psychologically terrorize this middle- aged couple in Natick," U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said at a news conference when charges were announced in June.
 An internal investigation was launched after San Jose, California-based eBay was notified by law enforcement of "suspicious actions by its security personnel," company officials wrote in a prepared statement. The employees were ultimately fired, the company said.
 • Another defendant charged in cyberstalking of Natick couple by former eBay employees
 Popp was a senior manager of global intelligence at eBay; Gilbert was senior manager of special operations for eBay's Global Security Team; Stockwell was manager of eBay's Global Intelligence Center; and Zea was an eBay contractor who worked as an intelligence analyst in the Global Intelligence Center. Authorities say they were working at eBay at the time of the alleged harassment.
 Court documents say the couple was targeted after their newsletter published an article in August 2019 about a lawsuit filed by eBay accusing Amazon of poaching its sellers.
