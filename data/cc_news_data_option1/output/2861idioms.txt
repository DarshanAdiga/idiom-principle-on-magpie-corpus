“We are rightful in saying that there is something fishy in the privatization plans, as the government wants to oblige some blue-eyed boys while privatizing state entities,” Asif said while taking part in the debate on privatization.
 He said they could see faces, which wanted to purchase the state entities and the electronic and social media were highlighting their names.
 “This is our unanimous concern because in the last one and a half month, the government has played havoc with the PIA. Thisstate entity has been made a laughing stock in the world due to a statement of minister for aviation,” he said.
 Minister for Privatization Muhammadmian Soomro moved the motion to discuss the privatization policy of the government. Rejecting the presence of non-elected people in the privatization committee, Asif said if some persons were bearing expenses of somebody, they should not be paid back from the people’s pockets.
 “We know that there are ATMs and blue-eyed people, who are being obliged and they are sitting in the cabinet,” he said, adding that if non-elected people could not become parliamentarians, then how they were included in the cabinet.
 He made it clear that the privatization committee, comprising cronies and ATMs, would not be acceptable to the opposition saying that the government wanted to oblige its masters sitting abroad through the privatization process.
 He said politicians never came through the backdoor, with the support of ATMs and umpire’s finger.
 “We the elected representatives face people time and again and our ACRs are written by our voters in every general election,” he added. He said the entire privatisation exercise would fizzle out if the state entities were sold out at throwaway prices to the people of liking.
 He recalled that it was Nawaz Sharif, who started the privatization process and then banks and ghee factories were privatized, while those who were rendered jobless were given golden handshakes. He said the PPP and Musharraf regime carried forward the same policy.
 “Only those organizations were privatized, which were running in losses,” he said. He regretted that billions of rupees had been spent on the Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) only to hide corruption of Rs2 to Rs3 billion.
 “We have sympathies with the employees but it is a continuous burden on the national kitty,” Asif said. As the voices against advisers to the prime minister holding dual nationality echoed in the House, Minister for Communication Murad Saeed came to the defence of the government.
 “There are no restrictions on dual nationals becoming advisers and special assistants,” he said. He reminded Khawaja Asif as to why no issue of patriotism was raised by him when he was foreign minister while holding Iqama.
 He further said it was a statement of Nawaz Sharif about Ajmal Qassam, which was used as a reference in the International Court of Justice. “You invited Modi and Jandal in Lahore and Murree calling them as your personal friends,” he said.
 He told the PML-N leadership that they should owe their place in politics to General Zia and General Jilani. He further charged that the PML-N leaders used to get court decisions by making phone calls to judges.
 “I am a politician and know very well as to who used short cut in politics,” he said. He reminded the PML-N leaders that it was Miftah Ismail who offered Steel Mills for free for those showing interest in the PIA.
 He pointed out that he had won a fake degree case against him in the court in 2014 but the opposition was again raising the same issue on the social media. He told the opposition that they would respond to every allegation but the House should focus on privatization.
 He said the PML-N faced criticism on issue of Ajmal Qasab but the PTI government itself was planning to bring changes to the law to facilitate RAW agent Kulbhushan Jadhav. PPP parliamentarian Dr. Nafeesa Shah said it was not right time for privatization but to purchase and not to sell anything. She questioned as to who would show interest in getting Roosevelt Hotel and Steel Mills in the prevailing circumstances.
 Demanding formation of a committee of House on privatization of state organizations since 1990, she said the country had achieved nothing from selling out various entities in the last three decades.
 Coming down harsh on the government, the PPP parliamentarians said the prime minister used to call dual nationals as traitors but he himself was keeping seven people in the cabinet who were foreigners or had dual nationality.
 “Bilawal Bhutto has rightly given a historic statement that the prime minister and the cabinet are selected,” Nafeesa Shah said. The National Assembly was Monday told that the government had no plans to limit the retirement age of government employees and do away with the annual increment in their salaries.
 Responding to a calling attention notice, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan categorically said there was no plan under consideration to limit the retirement age of government employees to 55 years or abolish the pension and stop the annual increment in salaries.
 The calling attention notice was moved by the opposition members Romina Khursheed Alam, Murtaza Javed Abbasi, Maulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali, Abdus Shakoor, and Agha Rafiullah. Responding to a calling attention notice moved by Romina Khursheed Alam, Babar Awan said there was also no proposal under consideration to increase the retirement age of judges. He told the House that a decision in this regard would require an amendment to the Constitution.
 PPP parliamentarian Shazia Mari on a point of order said the opposition wanted to move a privilege motion against Minister for Aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan for giving a false statement on the floor of the House on the fake licenses of Pakistani pilots.
 She said a letter written by DG Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to Kuwait Airlines also contradicted the minister’s statement. Parliamentary Secretary for National Health Services Nousheen Hamid told the House during the question hour that 0.3 million people had so far received medical treatment under this programme. She said an amount of Rs10 billion had been spent on the scheme.
 Nousheen said pharmaceutical companies had agreed not to increase the prices of medicines amidst the Covid-19 challenge. She said action would be taken if the prices were increased before September this year.
 Parliamentary Secretary for Railways Farrukh Habib said the upgradation of railways infrastructure under the seven billion dollars ML-1 project would help check train accidents. Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri told the House that the pilgrims’ welfare fund had been established and the amount in it was used for welfare of pilgrims in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
 He said the ministry in its account in scheduled banks had received Rs50 billion from applicants for Haj and earned Rs490 million as profit. Babar Awan also laid before the house the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (Amendment) Ordinance 2020.

Both the parties also decided to form joint opposition coordination committee, which will meet in the ongoing week, while the all parties conference (APC) will take place soon after Eidul Azha.
 The decisions were taken in a meeting between a PML-N delegation, led by party Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal, and PPP leadership on Monday. The N-League delegation called on PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari at Bilawal House. The visitors included Ahsan Iqbal and MNAs Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Khwaja Saad Rafique.
 PPP senior leaders including former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, President Central Punjab Qamar Zaman Kaira, Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmad, PPP parliamentary leader in Punjab Assembly Syed Hassan Murtaza.
 Later, addressing a joint press conference, Kaira and Ahsan said the nation wanted the government to go at the earliest. Qamar Zaman Kaira said that the opposition leader in National Assembly Mian Shahbaz Sharif had telephoned the PPP chairman a day before the current meeting after which ‘friends’ from the PML-N visited the Bilawal House.
 He said the situation demanded a joint and effective strategy. He told the media that the meeting decided to constitute the joint opposition coordination committee, in which Khwaja Asif, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Ayaz Sadiq, Rana Sanaullah and Khwaja Saad Rafique would represent the PML-N, while Nayyar Hussein Bokhari, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Naveed Qamar, Sherry Rehman, Farhatullah Babar would represent the PPP.
 He also said that names from other parties were also coming in. To a question, he said the APC would be held after Eid. Kaira, grilling the government over its cruel steps, said the PPP had braved hardships and struggled against martial law regimes. He said the opposition had to come up to expectations of the nation and it was also obvious that the government was in a hurry to go. He said former opposition leader in NA Syed Khursheed Shah had been the custody of National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for the last 10 months, but trial of his case had not started.
 Similarly, he said, opposition leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz Sharif had been in the custody, adding that NAB had failed to establish itself as an impartial body.
 PML-N Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal, while speaking on the occasion, told the media that a detailed meeting had taken place with the PPP chairperson and stated that the country had been pushed to severe economic challenges by the incumbent government. He said that freedom of expression was also being suppressed. To a question, the PML-N leader said Maryam Nawaz Sharif would also play her role and would go for mass contact campaign.
 News desk adds: The PPP and the PML-N announced on Monday the opposition had agreed to call an APC after Eidul Azha to devise a joint strategy against the government.
 The two parties announced formation of the joint action committee which will have representation of other political parties, besides the two main opposition parties. From the Awami National Party (ANP), Mian Iftikhar and Ameer Haider Khan Hoti will be part of the committee, while Senator Mir Kabeer Shahi from the National Party will also be part of it.
 Kaira said committee’s main focus would be to determine a way to rid the nation of the government. “A very serious and sensitive legislation is about to take place,” he said. “Opposition parties have coordination previously but we need to do more,” he added, saying that ‘comprehensive legislation’ was needed via a joint plan by both parties.
 Addressing the media after the meeting, Ahsan Iqbal said the PPP and the PML-N were in agreement that the current government was to blame for the economic crisis that Pakistan was going through.
 “No state in the 21st century can continue to exist with such a floundered economy,” he said, adding that improving the people’s standard of living was out of the question as the government was making life extremely hard for the masses.
 “The one who had a car, is now [left with] a motorbike. The one who had a motorbike is now on foot. People cannot afford education for their children. The labourers, farmers and graduates with degrees are worried,” he added.
 He said that Pakistan was facing internal and external threats due to the incumbent government. “Getting rid of the government is in line with the aspirations of the people of Pakistan,” he said.
 Iqbal said that the government was trying to impose a law, by using the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) conditions as an excuse to enact a law that was “not the NAB’s father but its grandfather” [far harsher than the NAB law].
 He said the government was bringing a law according to which authorities could have any person arrested for 90 days without bail. “After [the 90 days], the remand can be extended for another 90 days without bail. And the order will be issued by the secretary interior and the Punjab home secretary,” he added.
 He said any media worker, politician, political workers, trader or businessman could be sent to prison by the government on a bogus chit, prepared by prosecutors, that accuses an individual of the transfer of money through Hawala/Hundi.
 “We cannot allow the government to impose ‘black laws’ on Pakistan under the garb of FATF due to which individual freedom of expression is suppressed,” he said. Kaira said both parties were in agreement that the incumbent government was the ‘problem’ and that they must work to rid the nation of it.
 “I have already said that this government is the problem,” he said. “Both parties agree that the country must be rid of this government, “he said.

The plan is for Adobe's software to run in IBM's cloud system that has received regulatory approval for use by banks, the companies said, which will lead to more banking functions becoming totally digital over time.
 "Even now, for mortgage applications, for example, some of it is on paper, some of it is online," Anil Chakravarthy, general manager of digital experience for Adobe, said in an interview.
 "The possibility of being able to handle all of that sensitive data 100per cent digitally, that's the possibility that this opens up."
 IBM will also be able to connect the cloud-based system to a bank's internal stores of customer data, which "gives them much more flexibility to pick and choose on the data that they might put into a marketing campaign," Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president for IBM Global Markets, also said.

People are, of course, talking about John Lewis’ leadership within the nonviolent civil rights movement of the 1960s, but I hope we won’t lose sight of the fact he didn’t go into retirement after the significant gains of that era.
 What moves me about Mr. Lewis’ life is that he remained in the struggle. In some ways, photos of him sitting on the House floor in 2016, participating in the sit-in that he and other Democratic members organized in support of gun control legislation, are even more powerful than photos of him on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

Russians with “very close links” to President Vladimir Putin were “well integrated into the U.K. business, political and social scene — in ‘Londongrad’ in particular,” it said.
