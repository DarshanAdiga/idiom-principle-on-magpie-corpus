What’s Behind The Growth?
 To reach such an inflated value, Tesla’s stock first had to climb over 400% from the start of this year, a time that feels all too far away in light of the global pandemic. To determine what caused such monstrous growth, it would help to remember where Tesla was nearly a full year ago. The best way to paint the full picture of the company’s standing at the time is to look at their 2019 full year report. In the company’s year summary, the company touts its ability to begin production at their Shanghai Gigafactory and a return to profitability in the second half of the year. At the time, Tesla had not produced any Model Y vehicles but promised that deliveries would begin soon. This promise was upheld, as the Model Y saw its first delivery on March 13 of 2020. While this was slightly ahead of Tesla’s initial production schedule, investors should have been expecting this result already, as per the company’s Q3 2019 report. At this stage, Tesla had already announced the Berlin Gigafactory and would announce plans for a second North American factory, to be revealed as the Austin Gigafactory, just three months later.
 At this time, Tesla told investors to expect their Shanghai Gigafactory to reach full Phase 1 capacity by the end of 2020, as it did, and to see Model Y production ramp rapidly, as it did. The only thing that has happened this year that investors were not aware of before it began was the Austin Gigafactory. However, this shouldn’t have come as a surprise as Musk, as well as the company as a whole, had stated that the company required greater production capabilities to manufacture the Cybertruck and Semi. Essentially, by merely delivering on promises and fulfilling the bare minimum expectations held by investors, the company rose a jaw-dropping 400%.
 However, Tesla has failed to deliver on some other, rather important, promises that the company has made. Both the Tesla Semi and Roadster are potentially quite lucrative for Tesla due to the high margins and sale prices of the vehicles, yet neither have yet made it to production. The Semi was expected to begin production at the start of 2020, then the end of 2020, and as of Q1 2020 it was 2021. This is all after the truck was originally slated to begin production in 2019. The Tesla Roadster, originally slated for a 2020 production date, is now expected to begin production in mid to late 2021. However, no negative ramifications have come from the company’s inability to deliver on these two vehicles that have the potential to deliver strong profits. Perhaps even more important is the message that this should be sending investors, that Tesla is still struggling to deliver on promises that it makes.

More than 150,000 German students returned to school in August for in-person instruction, Time magazine reported. Students were split into "cohorts" designed to keep outbreaks confined to smaller groups, and they were required to wear face masks and wash their hands regularly. Classrooms were also rearranged "to allow for social distancing and better ventilation," according to Time.
 The Institute of Labor Economics determined in an October report that schools reopening after summer vacation in Germany didn't contribute to an uptick in coronavirus cases across the country.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel opted to keep schools open when she announced a new round of pandemic restrictions that shut down bars, restaurants and entertainment venues in October in Germany, The New York Times reported. Merkel cited "dramatic social consequences" associated with keeping students at home when issuing her decision.
 Leaders in France and Ireland have echoed that sentiment in keeping schools open while putting other restrictions in place.
 "We cannot and will not allow our children and young people's futures to be another victim of this disease," Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said, according to the Times. "They need their education."
 But not everyone is on board.
 The National Education Union -- one of England's main teachers' unions -- called schools "an engine for virus transmission" in a statement opposing Johnson's decision to keep schools open amid a second coronavirus lockdown. The union added "it would be self-defeating for the government to impose a national lockdown, whilst ignoring the role of schools as a major contributor to the spread of the virus."
 German teachers have also expressed concern over schools following the multitude of restrictions designed to keep students and educators safe.
 "We say, yes keep schools open, and keep following the rules for the levels of infection," said Heinz-Peter Meidinger, president of the German Teachers Association, according to the Times. "But do not keep schools open at any price."
 Henrik Saalbach, an education professor at the University of Leipzig, told the Pulitzer Center that German officials should consider shutting schools down again if the numbers don't change.
 "I think and hope they are better prepared to do that," he said.
 Some experts also say the pandemic has played out differently in the U.S. and Europe, making it difficult to compare public health decisions.
 "All of us have read the studies and experiences in Europe. And they seem to have been pretty positive," Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Time. "But the burden of disease in European communities is much less than what we're seeing. Europe has controlled the outbreak in most places more effectively than we have."

Competitive rivalry within the industry is also intensifying, and we believe that the growth in the healthy snack market is prompting a large volume of new entrants. Pricing pressure may also cause a decrease in margins in the long run, especially because retail customers are continuing to consolidate. Further consolidation of grocery and convenience brands will result in higher overall negotiating leverage for Hostess's customers in the B2B channel.
 The company is reliant on a select few major customers for continued revenue. Walmart accounted for 23.6% of all net revenue in 2019, and Hostess's top 10 customers accounted for 62.3% of all sales. The company states that "we do not have long-term supply contracts with any of our major customers (Hostess 10-K, 2020)." Hostess could lose a major customer for reasons out of its control, including customer financial performance and customers' higher perceived benefit from other food-makers with similar products.
 In summation, we maintain a neutral sentiment on the company as, although the company has a leading market share in a growing industry, long-term outlook is uncertain, given potential changes in consumer demand for Hostess's products, especially its sweet snacks segment.

The pandemic has forced retailers to shift their businesses online—and century-old sportswear brand FILA is no different.
 While FILA had a website, it hadn’t invested much into e-commerce in the past, instead relying on a strong wholesale business. In January, the brand hired Dawn Trenson as its first VP of ecommerce to develop an online sales strategy in North America.
 It turned out to be a prescient move. When COVID-19 hit the U.S. two months later, a savvy e-commerce strategy became all the more important for FILA.
 FILA had invested in the back-end of its website to enable online sales, but the site ”appeared to not be designed for conversion or customer experience, and there was no brand storytelling,” Trenson said. “So even if I had inventory, I didn’t have any way to present it.”
 FILA brought in consulting firm Capgemini to work on a site redesign that aimed to transform how the brand presented its products to consumers online. At the time, the site was missing basic user experience elements, such as recommending a sweatshirt to go with a pair of pants someone might be browsing.
 “We had an abysmal home page and product detail pages,” Trenson explained.
 In March, just after COVID-19 hit, the need for a functioning e-commerce experience became even more urgent. Capgemini began working on the website to get it to the point where FILA could “survive what we thought would be a two- week shutdown,” said Jennifer Conklin, VP of unified commerce at Capgemini.
 Just a week after fully relaunching the website in May, FILA rolled out its first online sneaker collaboration with the Notorious B.I.G. estate: a commemorative sneaker and t-shirt marking the 25th anniversary of the deceased rapper’s debut album. The collab was supposed to launch in retail stores, but the team shifted the event entirely online in light of COVID-19 restrictions.
 After selling out of its online stock within eight hours, Trenson worked with the logistics team to reroute inventory meant for retailers to a warehouse in Baltimore for online delivery. Thanks to quick thinking and better website functionality, it ended up being the biggest online sales event in FILA.com’s history, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Trenson said.
 “Through some magic we got all of the retailer units and were able to do a restock,” Trenson said. “Outside looking in, it looks like we planned it that way. It could've been millions of dollars of dead stock.”
 Capgemini also worked with FILA to acquire the right customer data to offer more personalized service online. FILA invested in an integrated CRM system to speak to consumers individually so they “feel like they’re included in the brand, not just buying from a retail partner store,” Trenson said.
 With the basics of its e-commerce strategy now in place, FILA is focused on continuing to grow its online business while also sharing data with other business lines, such as logistics to break down silos. The idea is to “put the customer first and think about engagement,” Trenson said.
 Now, FILA owns its narrative and storytelling, making it more impervious to the success of retailers to drive its business.
 “Traffic is traffic, but there’s financial and human effort to get eyeballs to the site and then they leave immediately because it makes no sense,” she said. “So let’s think about how we’re telling a story, how we’re engaging our customers.”

The Threat Graph is able to effectively process three trillion endpoint- related events per week, in real time. In addition, it indexes these events for future use to continuously improve its security. If Threat Graph discovers something “out of the ordinary” in one customer environment, its centralized nature allows all customers to benefit automatically in real time. This type of autonomous monitoring, helps CrowdStrike spot potential attacks across the entire customer base. The company believes that this service, called the Security Cloud, holds the potential to reshape the entire cybersecurity industry.
 For CrowdStrike, big data is power. Its two-step approach of separating endpoint agents from complex analysis of large datasets allows the platform to remain lightweight and nimble across a variety of endpoint devices, while still retaining the computational power necessary to detect a wide variety of threats. If a technologist were to create category-defining cloud platforms, they would likely start with Salesforce, for their CRM capabilities. In terms of HR in the cloud, one might pick Workday. When it comes to security in the cloud, we believe CrowdStrike is the clear leader.
 ## Cross Sell:
 Once a servicing agreement has been reached, CrowdStrike utilizes a “land-and- expand” sales strategy in order to boost recurring product sales. Once a customer installs the Falcon platform, they are able to register any number of additional cloud-based modules, dependent on the level and type of protection required. Customers have the ability to purchase and deploy additional platforms onto the same agent already present on the endpoint.
 Cross-selling is an important aspect of CrowdStrike’s business model. One a company begins to understand the power of its Falcon platform, customers begin to use more of its modules. For example, in FY’18, the percentage of subscription customers using 4 or more modules was only 17%. Only 3 years later, this is now 57%. As customers utilize more modules, CrowdStrike earns significantly more revenue and profits. This is benefit of attractive unit economics and scale. By this time next year, CrowdStrike believes that 39% of its subscription customers will be using 5 or more of its cloud modules.

 # NY-22: Judge orders new vote tally following Herkimer, Madison updates
 Steve Howe
 Observer-Dispatch
 In the continuing uncertainty of a tight New York 22nd Congressional District race, recent vote count changes from county boards of election have raised real concerns from the overseeing judge about the process.
 Headed into the weekend, totals put U.S. Rep. Anthony Brindisi, D-Utica, ahead by 13 votes. That total, apparently, has flopped again, giving Republican Claudia Tenney the upper hand.
 A new total vote count in all counties in New York’s 22nd Congressional District was due by 4 p.m. Monday, according to an order from state Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte. The updated vote count now shows Tenney ahead by 12 votes in the unofficial tally.
 The order came Monday after the board of elections in Herkimer and Madison counties reported new totals Nov. 29 and Nov. 30, respectively. The hotly contested race is in the process of a judicial review.
 DelConte ordered boards of elections in the congressional district’s eight counties to not alter any election tallying records and to submit a final tally of early, Election Day, affidavit and military voting by the Monday deadline.
 The order also amends the deadline for motions in the case to Wednesday and opposition papers and cross-motions to Thursday. Oral arguments on the motions will be heard at 1 p.m. Dec. 7 in Oswego County Supreme Court.
 DelConte addressed the communications from the county boards of elections on changing vote totals in his order.
 “These communications raise additional, very serious concerns to the Court about the pending judicial review of the challenged ballots in this Congressional race,” he said.
 The legal team for Tenney filed a motion for county boards of elections to certify the election results in the race for New York’s 22nd Congressional District in Oswego County Supreme Court on Monday.
 The motion would clear the way for a recanvass of the results to be ordered by DelConte. The filing showed the legal teams for Brindisi and Tenney requested a 24-hour extension to file new motions.
 In a motion Sunday, Brindisi’s legal team confirmed that the Herkimer County Board of Elections updated its totals, giving 35 more votes to Tenney and 10 to Brindisi after correcting transcribing errors. The campaign was first notified of the altered vote count after it was tweeted by talk radio host Bob Lonsberry and confirmed during a conversation with Charles Crandall, attorney for the Herkimer County Board of Elections, according to the letter.
 The results would put Tenney back ahead by 12 votes, with more than 310,000 votes cast.
 Both campaigns weighed in on the latest news in the case with statements on Monday.
 Tenney spokesman Sean Kennedy said the campaign was encouraged by the correction to early tabulations which now show Tenney ahead in the unofficial results.
 “Our campaign is committed to seeing that all — and only — legal votes count,” Kennedy said. “The voters’ will must be respected and the integrity of the election process maintained. We are confident Claudia will emerge the winner when all is said and done.”
 Brindisi campaign spokesman Luke Jackson said the margin in the races is close and continues to change.
 “The integrity of the election and maintaining a count that ensures the voters of this district are heard is of the utmost importance,” Jackson said. “As this process continues to play out, we are hopeful that once the counting process is completed, Anthony will be declared the winner.”

But on the other hand, reinvested capital doesn't usually carry with it the taxes that are imposed on recipients of dividends.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Dealing with more than their fair share of 2020 bad luck, the Cincinnati Bengals have ranged from terrible to fairly good in stretches, sometimes in the same game. The flicker of excitement that was growing because of the development of rookie quarterback Joe Burrow ended when the top overall draft pick went down with a season-ending injury Nov. 22. Second-year coach Zac Taylor said Monday that Burrow will have surgery sometime this week. Now with five games to go, the Bengals (2-8-1) are playing for pride — and a late win or two that might show the team has at least made some progress from the 2-14 finish last year. “We're sick and tired of this feeling,” Taylor said. Cincinnati lost its third straight game Sunday since a promising win over Tennessee on Nov. 1. The Bengals fell to the New York Giants 19-17 in yet another close game — five of the season's losses have been by five points or fewer — that came down to a Cincinnati blunder. After being woeful offensively for most of the game, the Bengals scored a touchdown with 2 1/2 minutes left in the game to get within two points. After the Giants punted, Cincinnati got the ball back at midfield with 57 seconds left, needing only 15 to 20 yards to get in range for a game-winning field goal. Next play, quarterback Brandon Allen is sacked, fumbles and the Giants recover. Game over. “There's no excuses to be made,” Allen said. Despite the lackluster play of Allen, who was promoted from the practice squad last week, Taylor plans to stay with him for now. The other choices appear to be backup Ryan Finley and Kevin Hogan, who was signed to the practice squad Saturday. “It does get frustrating, working hard throughout the week and get losses at the end of the week — and not getting...

This was the period of decline and dissolution of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies which had played an enormous role in the efforts by the Mengistu government to create a socialist society under the leadership of the Workers Party of Ethiopia (WPE). Herman Cohen, the-then U.S. Undersecretary for African Affairs, had been involved in negotiations to bring about peaceful settlement to the wars in Ethiopia between the Mengistu administration and the EPRDF. Cohen emerged from the talks held in London issuing a statement recognizing the TPLF-EPRDF as the legitimate government in Ethiopia.

Lucky One - 14:00 Southwell
 Lucky One stepped up on his reappearance/stable debut when second at Uttoxeter last time, travelling best and looking the likeliest winner before faltering on the run-in (beaten five and a half lengths). His weak finishing effort was all his own doing after he'd refused to settle in the early stages, but he should have a bigger performance in him if getting a stronger pace to aim at now back down to two miles. When you consider that he's already proved himself capable of fair form, then this looks a good opportunity for him to open his account over hurdles on his third try for Paul Nicholls.

While the four Tweedy, Browne Funds were up between 23.8% and 29.5% since the March 23rd market lows through September 30, and have recouped much of the ground lost during the pandemic-driven sell-off, they remain in the red year- to-date, and have trailed their respective benchmark indexes. This is largely due to the Funds' value and international orientations. These areas of the global equity markets have lagged their growth and U.S. counterparts. Recent underperformance has compromised the Funds' annualized comparisons over one-, five-, and ten-year periods. Prior to 2013, all four Funds outpaced their benchmarks in most standardized annualized reporting periods. As a result, longer-term comparisons remain quite favorable, particularly for our flagship fund, the Tweedy, Browne Global Value Fund, which over time has ranked near the top of its peer group universe at Morningstar. Following are the Morningstar peer group comparisons for the Global Value Fund and the performance history for all four Funds, including comparisons with relevant benchmark indexes.

Then Schumer said they will ‘change’ America. The ‘change’ they are planning for America is adding justices to the Supreme Court, changing the Supreme Court, giving statehood to D.C. Now, D.C. is not as big as Atlanta, but D.C. is going to be a state if the Democrats get their way. Statehood for Puerto Rico, and making sure they take health insurance away from 153 million Americans and 57 million Medicare enrollees and putting everyone into a Medicaid-style program that is run by the government. They want to implement the Green New Deal, and they want to give felons the right to vote—and that is the plan just for their first 100 days.

Bad times for the world are good times for McKinsey. The firm’s business dramatically expanded after the 2008 financial crisis because corporations and governments were looking for expertise in navigating the disaster and were willing to pay for that advice even as they cut other things, like their workforces. It’s reasonable to think that at this time of extraordinary upheaval in the world, they’re doing brisk business. Who knows what kinds of problems, say, a pharmaceutical company testing a life-saving vaccine, or a government trying to figure out who should get it first, might be asking right now? It’s probably a pretty good bet that McKinsey is in the middle of a lot of those discussions, although we may never know who they are advising or what their advice may be. I should say that, for all the horrible things that have come out about the firm, it is still a repository of an enormous amount of intelligence (in every sense of the word). As much as you might criticize McKinsey’s ethical choices in certain cases, they still appear to be generally excellent at what they do, and maybe that’s who you want to be involved in devising the response to the greatest public health–economic-fiscal-social crisis in living memory. That’s the thing about amorality: It can go either way.

We have a request for President Trump: Broker a deal on a stimulus package.
   
 This might be your last big opportunity of your presidency to show the American people what you're capable of. Please don't waste it. This is the decent thing to do. The right thing to do.
   
 So many people are hurting and could really use the money a stimulus package could provide. The first package came when we needed it most, and we'd like to remind you that another was also promised.
   
 Does the campaign slogan "promises kept" ring a bell? This is something you could be the driving force on. Just get it done.
   
 Can you imagine what that could do for people, Mr. President? It might be the difference for folks having to choose between rent and food. It might mean some folks might have an actual holiday season when they otherwise might not. It might help some people pay off some debt they've accrued since the pandemic or help a millennial pay off a student loan.
   
 Each person has a different circumstance. but everyone has a need.
   
 For small businesses -- the life force of our communities -- it might mean the difference before keeping their doors open in 2021.
   
 No matter what, it would help.
   
 So we'd really like to see you make an effort to get a package delivered to your desk to sign. This is a moment we believe you can meet. You don't have to leave the White House. Start making calls. Tell Mitch McConnell it's a go. Tell Sens. Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran to make it happen. U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall. too.
   
 We have faith you can get it done if you try.
   
 We highly doubt the Democrats will fight you on this, but know that the American people want a stimulus.
   
 To hold one ransom during a pandemic to score political points would be immoral. Show us you know the art of a deal.
   
 Go out with a bang and give the United States the stimulus it needs to keep the economy firing on all cylinders.

However, Tesla is not just working on these two facilities. With their Berlin and Austin Gigafactories working towards production as well, the company will likely see their output nearly quadruple within the next five years. While the production at Austin will likely be below the targeted 500,000 of other facilities, the greater revenue from higher sales prices of the Semi and Cybertruck will make up for the reduced volume. While this wouldn’t equate to an exact 4x multiplication of the revenue, it would likely come quite close. Unfortunately for the company, Tesla’s battery storage business is unlikely to see much growth in the near future as production is reserved mostly for vehicle production. Following the 4x multiplier laid out above, Tesla’s current annualized automotive revenue of $30.444 billion would see an increase to $121.776 and I would expect total revenue to remain somewhere in the ballpark of $120 billion to $160 billion at the end of 2026. However, keep in mind that this is under the assumption that Tesla will continue to sell every car that it manufactures -- far from a guarantee.
 ## Basis of Tesla’s Value
 Now that Tesla’s growth, which is what I believe to be its greatest competitive advantage, is out of the way, I can go on to discuss how the company is being valued. Tesla’s valuation has always been a bit speculative, as is the nature of any growth company, but now it seems that this speculation has become simply unjustifiable. Tesla’s current valuation, as I see it, is based on three major categories: production growth, autonomous vehicles, and their lead in the EV market creating strong demand. In a previous article, I detailed why Tesla’s position as the unquestionable leader of the EV market is coming to an end. This means that the company, which has seen demand exceed production practically since it began producing vehicles, may soon start to face more difficulty selling its vehicles. With demand already showing signs of weakness, especially in Europe where most of Tesla’s challengers are beginning their electric pushes, the future for Tesla looks far less secure.

I guarantee you I am going to be out there working every single day—night and day—to make certain that we win these races. You just think about the people who would be heading these various committees. Do you really want Bernie Sanders chairing the Senate Budget Committee? Do you really want somebody like Elizabeth Warren leading the Senate Armed Services Committee? Do you really want someone like Dick Durbin as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee? Most Georgians would say no I’m not comfortable with that because these are individuals who are too far left for me.

 Go out with a bang and give the United States the stimulus it needs to keep the economy firing on all cylinders.

This is where things start to fall apart. You set your sights on another neighborhood. This one might not even have any established factions, so you’ll sweep your way through to your second neighborhood. A neighboring faction might ask you to help them with their war. You say sure, what do you have to lose? It instantly becomes your war; your ally is all but useless, but it’s only a minor roadblock. You raid your enemy’s safehouse with a new, refined squad. A couple people have sniper rifles by this point, while your demolitionist is chucking grenades and shrapnel and causing a big mess on the dancefloor. And, before you know it, you’re the czar of Chicago, uncontested and without peer. It does feel cool, but also a bit cheap.

The thing that I’m most excited about for Season 2 is that we just really get to explore the black female experience, in light of this past year, with the protests, with COVID, and with the disparities that exist within the healthcare system for poor people and people of color, no matter the economic background, as well as what is happening with Lola as a mother. She’s a woman who is about to become a mom and balance career with motherhood. I’m just really excited about all of the different points that we are looking to explore this season and how those changes affect every relationship. I’m looking forward to seeing the evolution of Mark and Lola’s relationship, as two friends who’ve known each other for 15 plus years, but have a very different experience in America, and what that does.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The light extravaganza tradition called Celebration in the Oaks that is held yearly in City Park has turned into a drive-thru experience as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of visitors usually go to the park every holiday season to see the elaborate light show. It features various scenes and characters made out of lights interspersed throughout the park's trees and landscapes. A scene depicting the retelling of a Cajun Christmas story is a particular favorite of visitors. In recent years, visitors would buy a ticket and walk through a section of the park where the lights are arranged. But this year the coronavirus pandemic has meant some changes. Instead of walking, visitors will buy tickets and drive through the park to see the lights. “During COVID right now, this is a safe thing to do,” Amanda Frentz, director of public relations for New Orleans City Park, told WDSU News. “You drive up through this tent and you put your mask on just to be able to scan your ticket, and after that, you’re in your little pod and with your people. You’re able to move through and have a great holiday experience.” In some ways it's a return to the way things used to be done, Frentz told The Associated Press. Before 2005's Hurricane Katrina, visitors could buy tickets for a walking or driving tour, she said. But the hurricane damaged the park's infrastructure so much that it became strictly a walking tour, she said. Park workers have erected the light creations along the park's roads. Visitors buy tickets ahead of time through the park's website. The event is the park's largest fundraiser.

It seems that nothing ever changes when it comes to hawking insurance to fill the gaps in Medicare coverage for seniors. The fervent sales pitches, the misinformation, and the incomplete and deceptive information continue to proliferate.
 For the last several weeks, I’ve heard ad after ad, particularly on TV news shows, urging older viewers to call 800 numbers to learn about the latest and greatest Medicare Advantage plans. Retired football star Joe Namath says you need to “get everything you’re entitled to.” Namath rattles off a bunch of extra benefits MA plans offer – dental, vision, hearing, prescription drug coverage – “all at no extra cost.” He urges viewers to “call the number on your screen now. It’s free.”
 These are new benefits the government has allowed private insurers to sell in the hope of getting more seniors to leave traditional Medicare in favor of a privatized system. By transferring more costs to seniors, the government saves money.
 Another commercial promises “free eyeglasses and free rides,” presumably to doctors’ offices. Yet another tells viewers they “may qualify” to get $144 added back to their Social Security benefits. The Medicare Part B premium for 2021 is $148.50, which is, presumably, what the commercial promises to save those who choose the privatized system.
 I suspected those ads were misleading and deceptive come-ons, designed to persuade listeners to make the call. So I made some calls. The 800 numbers lead to an insurance brokerage firm or agency that apparently has a network of licensed agents located around the country. Callers are asked to give their zip code and then are transferred to an agent who can give the “free benefits” review.
 I have heard close to 100 Medicare sales pitches over the years and know that those free consultations are meant to result in a sale whether the senior needs the insurance or is really getting a better plan.
 Seldom is there any talk about making sure people are covered for the huge amounts doctors and hospitals sometimes charge that Medicare doesn’t cover. What are the trade-offs, for example, between buying an MA plan, which pays those charges after you satisfy a large annual out of pocket maximum – next year $6,700 per person – or buying a traditional Medigap insurance supplement Plan G, which covers those charges right away? A couple with Medicare Advantage could pay as much as $13,400 a year before their plan would pay for anything.
 With so many choices, what’s a consumer to do? I rang up Bonnie Burns, one of the best Medicare consumer advocates in the country, for advice.
 “It’s just too complicated,” she said. “No wonder people throw up their hands. That’s why people sign up for an Advantage plan with little or no premium and find out what the costs really are as they use benefits through the year.” She added, “It would be so much easier if Medicare Advantage plans and drug plans were standardized so people could figure this out.”
 Congress’ decision not to standardize Advantage plans or drug plans has resulted in today’s chaotic marketplace. Congress wanted to allow every insurer in the universe to throw something out there so the companies could make money and could entice more people to leave the traditional Medicare program. The goal was to reduce the costs to the program, all the while side- stepping any action to control run-away medical costs.
 Note that Congress did standardize Medicare supplement policies – known as Medigap policies — in the early 1990s because that market was as chaotic and misleading then as the MA market is today. I like to think of that action as the high-water mark of consumer protection, and I have no illusions that anything like it will happen again anytime soon.
 One final bit of crucial advice is missing in today’s ads. Even after you enroll in an MA plan, perhaps enticed by a few dollars in savings for a pair of glasses, you can return to traditional Medicare in the future. But in all but four states — New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts,and Maine – state laws prohibit you from buying a Medigap supplement without an insurer scrutinizing your health status.
 If you have developed a pre-existing condition, you may be ineligible for a Medigap policy. I’ve met many people over the years who bought an Advantage plan, got sick, and needed to go to out of network for treatment. They learned the hard way they were shut out of the Medigap market for good.
 What choices have you made for covering Medicare’s gaps?

Crowdstrike has no long-term debt or redeemable preferred stock, securities outstanding, and holds enough cash to cover its current liabilities twice over. As we just discussed, Crowdstrike has recently turned the page on generating operating cash flow. We believe this demonstrates that the Crowdstrike’s current heavy focus on product investments are beginning to bear fruit. The free cash flow will dramatically increase, once the management team believes it can fully leverage the existing model. As of today, the expectations for EBITDA this fiscal year and next year are modest. The Street sits at roughly $50 million of EBITDA this fiscal year and $100 million next. While doubling EBITDA is great, it really is just scratching the surface of profitability. Crowdstrike is at an interesting inflection point. Its revenue growth is extraordinary, but it has not yet become wildly profitable. It generates free cash flow, but the margins have yet to become fully leveraged.
 We fully anticipate free cash flow growth exceeding revenue growth for the next several years. Applying a current or forward valuation to this modest level of free cash flow is still difficult, but at least it is not a revenue multiple. We just believe companies using revenue multiples are often firms that simply don’t generate any free cash flow, something which history has taught us to be concerned with. At this point in time, CrowdStrike has positioned itself in the top spot of cybersecurity software companies. To remain the industry leader, it needs to re-invest large amounts towards R&D and marketing. This essentially allows it to widen its moat and build higher and higher barriers to entry. In the near future, we believe Crowdstrike will be able to open up the free cash flow spigot, as its margins continue to improve.
 ## Metrics:
 As we just talked about, Crowdstrike’s revenue growth is impressive and its margins are beginning to climb. It generates free cash flow, but reported earnings are still underwhelming. In order to frame a valuation, we must look forward, to a time where Crowdstrike is more mature and its business becomes leverageable.

We decided to take a trip down memory lane to examine what happened to some of the most successful dot-com darlings of that era. Many of these stocks had appreciated by 400% to 500% during the late 1990s, greatly surpassing what was a strong period overall for stock market performance. In the chart below, we attempt to illustrate the before and after for a number of those companies. Bear in mind that these companies were not dot-com "airballs," but rather were rapidly growing and profitable companies much like the FAANGs today.
