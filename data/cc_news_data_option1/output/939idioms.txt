HATTIESBURG, Miss. (WDAM) - Southern Miss allowed Saturday’s contest to hang in the balance for most of the afternoon until a three-run sixth inning lifted the Golden Eagles to their third weekend series win of the season.Gabe Montenegro’s two-run single broke a 1-1 tie as USM defeated Little Rock 4-1.“In that situation with less than two outs, you’re just trying to hit it up in the air to avoid that double play," Montenegro said. "When I came in in that inning, I was just trying to get something up in the air so we could score the run.”“Gabe’s been struggling a little bit so to see him come out of that and really put a good swing on that two-run base hit that he got, that was the pivotal point in the game, really,” said USM head coach Scott Berry.Ben Ethridge continued to impress with the third victory of his freshman season. The right-hander allowed just one run on four hits and struck out five in seven innings pitched.The Trojans lone run came in the second inning when Ethridge’s wild throw allowed Miguel Soto to score from third.USM responded in the bottom half of the frame when West Jones’ Dustin Dickerson sacrifice fly to left field scored Danny Lynch. The Golden Eagles (11-3) look for the series sweep on Sunday at 1 p.m.Copyright 2020 WDAM. All rights reserved.

The result: an ability to control an FPS game on the 360 with the Wiimote and Nunchuk attachment. The best part is that the creator's documented the process so you can build your own if you really feel the need to play Halo with a Wiimote (and have money to buy a Samsung UMPC). [Live]

 Trailing 45-42 with under 3 minutes remaining in the game, Philomath High’s boys basketball team needed to dig deep to avoid a major upset against No. 15-seeded Phoenix. Veteran coach Blake Ecker has often found answers to these situations through defensive strategy. And it proved to be the difference again in what ended up as a 48-45 victory Saturday night for the Warriors.
 “We’ve been doing some drills this last week where we have to get four stops in a row,” Ecker said. “That fourth stop is really hard and so we talked about that a little bit here. You’ve got to get those four stops, you have no choice but to get a stop. And they did it, they got the stop and they got some key rebounds when we needed them.”

Kiev, March 8 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 8th Mar, 2020 ) :Ricky, a larger than life golden retriever, wags his tail as he nestles his head on Vasyl's lap. But still the war veteran looks tense.
 Then the dog throws his front paws onto the shoulders of the 47-year-old suffering from post-war trauma, and a smile forms across his face.
 "This is probably the most soothing thing," says Vasyl in the corridor of a large medical centre for veterans in Kiev.
 Vasyl, who along with other interviewees declined to give his full name due to the stigma around mental health in the country, was wounded fighting Russian- backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
 Now, he is one of the participants in an initiative to help soldiers overcome post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the help of therapy dogs.
 In it's sixth year, Kiev's conflict with separatists in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Lugansk regions has claimed more than 13,000 lives, including 4,000 Ukranian troops.
 With some 10,000 soldiers injured in the conflict, one group of volunteers hopes dog therapy can be a resource for veterans whose injuries are hidden.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — SpaceX successfully launched another load of station supplies for NASA late Friday night and nailed its 50th rocket landing.
 The Falcon rocket blasted off with 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of equipment and experiments for the International Space Station. Just minutes later, the spent first-stage booster made a dramatic midnight landing back at Cape Canaveral, its return accompanied by sonic booms.
 “And the Falcon has landed for the 50th time in SpaceX history!” SpaceX engineer Jessica Anderson announced amid cheers at Mission Control. “What an amazing live view all the way to touchdown.”
 The Dragon capsule, meanwhile, hurtled toward a Monday rendezvous with the space station.
 It’s the 20th station delivery for SpaceX, which has launched nearly 100,000 pounds (45,360 kilograms) of goods to the orbiting outpost and returned nearly that much back to Earth since it began shipments in 2012. Northrop Grumman is NASA’s other commercial shipper.
 SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk said it was the windiest conditions ever — 25 mph to 30 mph (40 kph to 48 kph) — for a booster landing at Cape Canaveral, but he wanted to push the envelope. The landing was the 50th successful touchdown of a SpaceX booster following liftoff, either on land or at sea.
 “Envelope expanded,” Musk tweeted following touchdown.

In commemoration of the Battle of Tel Hai, thousands belonging to the Betar Youth Movement gathered at the Roaring Lion Monument in the Upper Galilee this week to mark the centennial of the famous confrontation.
 The event revolved around the heroism of a Jewish defensive paramilitary group and their commander Joseph Trumpeldor.
 The battle, which took place - March 1, 1920 - in the heat of the Franco- Syrian War, began when several hundred Shiite Arabs from Southern Lebanon accompanied by a large contingency of Bedouin villagers from a nearby town besieged the Jewish village of Tel Hai.
 The Arab party demanded to search the settlement for French soldiers, however, the majority of the town believed that they wanted to enter under false pretenses - thinking instead that they were there to drive out the Jewish settlers.
 Upon the request, a Tel Hai farmer fired a shot into the air, signalling for nearby reinforcements stationed at Kfar Giladi led by Joseph Trumpeldor. Seeing that he was greatly outnumbered, when Trumpeldor arrived with his ten men, he initially attempted to send the Arab militia away through negotiations.
 When those failed, he allowed the Bedouin Mukhtar Kamal Affendi into the village to search for French soldiers. While the Mukhtar was in the village a shot discharged and a firefight between the two parties ensued.
 Joseph Trumpeldor was shot in the hand and stomach. He died while being evacuated to Kfar Giladi and has been credited with saying, "No matter, it is good to die for our country." ( _Eyn daber, tov lamut be-ad eretznu_ )
 Six other Jews and five Arab fighters died in the skirmish. The settlers of Tel Hai abandoned the town, and it was eventually burnt to the ground by the attacking Shiite party. Many are unclear if this act was part of the Franco- Syrian War or an escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
 The town was resettled in 1921 after the end of the war.
 "The ethos of Tel Hai was fashioned from the spirit of Joseph Trumpeldor. Only a man who is willing to sacrifice his life for the realization of the Zionist idea will be remembered 100-years after his passing. To always put the fulfillment of the Jewish state before personal interest. This is the heroism of Tel Hai," said head of Betar's international division Neira Meir.
 Yaakov Hagoel, deputy chairman of the World Zionist Organization added that every generation we see a new Trumpeldor. He referred to the example of Roi Klein jumping on a live grenade in during the Second Lebanon War in 2006, a move that saved dozens of his fellow soldiers. He added that he died a hero, and his actions will forever be remembered.
 "You don't have to be killed to be a Trumpeldor, you don't have to die to establish the homeland," Hagoel concluded. " If we are all Zionists, then our country will continue to flourish."

“That’s the lowest scoring half I’ve seen in a long time,” said Virginia head coach Derek Aho. “Proctor came out and I think their plan was to just hold the ball if they got an early lead, even if it was a 2-0 lead. It just slowed us up and that’s not our style.”
 Virginia’s standout senior Jayden Bernard was limited to just eight points in the contest. Aho gave the Rails all the credit for limiting Bernard, as well as almost pulling off the upset.
 “They made us do some thinking at halftime. They did a great job of keeping Jayden out of it all game and after everyone came out flat in the first half, we started to panic and forced our shots.”
 The second half was kinder to the Blue Devils. It took some time, but with four minutes to play, Virginia finally grabbed a lead that they were able to hang on to. Aho gave credit to the Devils’ leading scorer Jack Toman (11 points) for helping push the team over the finish line.
 “We slowly started working our way back in during the second half and I’m proud of our guys for pulling it off. Jack really stepped up for us and played well and hit some big shots. He was definitely our spark plug in the second half and really got the team going.”
 While Aho may not have predicted the style of basketball Proctor was going to play, he said he ultimately wasn’t surprised that they tried something unusual to aid their cause.
 “It doesn’t matter in the playoffs. Teams will do whatever they can when it comes to keeping their season alive. I almost wish you could ignore the seeds next to a team’s name because none of that matters when every team is giving you the best that they have.

 There is often little positive news coming out of war-fatigued Democratic Republic of Congo. This week though, the last patient of the latest Ebola outbreak walked out of hospital, discharged and free of the virus.
 The event was celebrated with jubilation as the medical community in Beni, North Kivu discharged their last admitted patient whom they declared fully recovered.
 Nurses marked the event with song and dance, and awarded the patient, a woman identified as Masiko, a certificate to show that she was free of the disease.   This victory was 19 months and several deaths later.
 According to figures from the Congolese ministry of Health, the latest outbreak had killed 2,264, making it the worst in the country.
 This was the tenth such outbreak in the DR Congo, and medical experts were warning this week there should be no celebration yet of conquering the virus.
 In fact, the World Health Organisation showed cautious optimism, declaring that the last patient discharge was “good news,” but said more will be done to ensure the DR Congo was over the outbreak.

 This team will provide consistency for the family and safe people they can reach out to for help
 “I can identify at least three women on my caseload who fit with this new Safe Babies Court idea,” said April Gubrud-Robertson a Probation Officer at Thursday’s stakeholder meeting. “They live in isolation, some with depression, violence and addiction. Some are single-parents. They feel like they don’t have resources. They don’t trust reaching out for help in case their child is taken.”
 Gubrud-Robertson talked about clients who reached out for parenting help and had their child removed from their care.
 “The goal is to have services in place and a system of communication and community to support families so they do not end up in the courts,” said Lind.
 This team is coordinated by a Safe Babies Court Community Coordinator, such as Cook. “The coordinator will take the big systems to the community and work with the teams,” explained Cook.
 The Safe Babies Court Team will meet depending on the needs of the family. Some will meet several times a week while others may meet on months rotating with court appearances.
 “It was about two years ago that two crazy people, by the names of Kelly Linda and Paula Stocke, approached Judge Anderson and myself and said on our own we can’t address this problem,” said Friday, Thursday to a room full of stakeholders and representatives from organizations throughout the community, “we don’t have the resources to positively impact outcomes.” He said the departments of Public Health and Children and Family Services, as represented by these two women, were willing to stop existing in their silos and work together.
 Friday was honest in the fact that the court and foster care systems are traumatic for children. “It is time to come together as a community, leverage the resources and experiences we have to help our families.”
 He is enthusiastic about transitioning to a trauma and attachment informed model. Its purpose is to decrease trauma to the developing child and increase healthy attachments which help the child grow to succeed.
 Dr. Amy Huffer is a Technical Assistance Specialist for the National Infant- Toddler Court Program and with Zero to Three and she presented to the group of stakeholders on Thursday and Friday.
 A slide in Huffer’s presentation “Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health: What is it? Why Does it Matter?” said, “Attachment is one of the best protective factors against stress and trauma.”
 The idea behind the Safe Babies Court model is that by better nurturing attachment between child and a caregiver, there will be a decrease in trauma.
 “Integrity of the child’s development is not only put at risk when the child experiences adverse situations,” explained Huffer, “but also when dangerous situations threaten those with whom they have attachments, such as when a parent is abused.”
 Although the Virginia model is following that of the Zero to Three organization, Friday said they will focus on those 0-18 months of age. According to statistics presented by Huffer, 55 percent of children, nationally, coming into foster care are under the age of three.
 Thursday’s meeting was full of county workers, foster parents, probation, media, health care, law enforcement. The table is open to others who were not represented such as elected officials, librarians, dentists, daycare providers and lay people.
 During the morning break, a small group gathered to discuss what had so far been discussed.
 In the audience was Eveleth Police Chief Tim Koivunen. “I was invited by the team to learn about this program. It is valuable information and I think we will have more training on these topics in the future.”
 Sherri Teasck, a retired foster parent and county social worker in voluntary services said this is about creating a village around a family to help raise the child(ren).
 “As an agency, we need to continue to engage with families and promote attachment,” said Rachel Koivunen, a court liaison through Saint Louis County. “We should surround people with support and services to establish safety and promote attachment.”
 “We are not asking for perfection from parents,” said Friday in his chambers on Wednesday. “We need parents to meet the needs of their child. We don’t need a perfect parent.”
 As plans go into effect, families will begin to be screened to participate in this program.
 “This is a complete community transformation in how we identify and help families,” said Lind.
 Huffer said that it is important to respond to families in this program with empathy. “Families are not on our radar because they just don’t care...In order to do this work and sit at this table, we have to practice compassion and that begins with ourselves.”
 “We are beginning our baby steps,” said Cook of the change approaching Virginia in the form of Safe Babies Court.

The loss ended Tipton’s season at 19-6. Blackford advances to regional play with a 21-5 record.
 “First of all, congratulations to them. I thought they played very, very well,” first-year Tipton coach Cliff Hawkins said. “I really like their team, but I love our team.
 “I thought we had some of the best leadership that you could have with our seniors. Our underclassmen in the locker room were awfully sad because they realized how good of leaders these guys were. About three of them came over and said they were hurting because of the loss, but they were hurting because they realize those guys are gone now.”
 After Blackford’s fast start, Tipton recovered but Blackford held Tipton at arm’s length the entire first half, leading 18-12 after a quarter and 33-24 at halftime. Tipton had the lead down to three points twice in the first quarter and got no closer than six back in the second period.
 In a battle of go-go teams, defense made a difference. Blackford’s zone defense concentrated on taking Tipton forward Ben Humrichous out of the picture and the Blue Devils turned to their outside game. But Tipton was just 2-of-14 from 3-point territory in the first half, and Humrichous was limited to five points at halftime.
 “I was really worried about their big fella [Humrichous] and then [Noah Wolfe] has been the key to them,” Blackford coach Jerry Hoover said. “If you can hold [Wolfe] under 30% shooting, then they lose the game. And we tried to do both. We weren’t successful with [Wolfe] at all but I felt like we did contain the big fella a little bit and that helped us. [Mylan Swan] is a much better shooter than he showed [Saturday] and that helped us too.”
 Swan had both Tipton’s 3-pointers in the first half and finished 3 of 11 from 3-land for nine points. Wolfe led the Blue Devils with 17 points and Humrichous finished with 12.
 The Blue Devils were 3-of-18 from 3-point territory in the second half, with several coming late as Tipton tried to get close after trailing 50-40 through three quarters.

Jan Swartz, group president of Princess Cruises and Carnival Australia, said, “These include immediately implementing safe social distancing, asking for information and delivering prescription request forms, increasing the fresh- air mix into the ventilation system in the state rooms and providing masks to our crew who are delivering food.”
 “We at Princess have been focusing on the things that are within our control, which is enhancing [guests'] in-cabin experience through significantly increasing the amount of internet bandwidth to the ship, adding 99 more movies and television shows, among many other ways that we have learned to help support our guests,” Swartz said. All passengers are being provided free internet and phone service so that they can keep in touch with friends and family.
 Another initiative being implemented in case Grand Princess is forced to remain at sea much longer will ensure that guests don’t run out of their prescription medications. Passengers were asked to submit their prescription medication needs via an online or paper form, and a list was compiled, prioritized and sent ashore for rapid fulfillment.
 The hope is that the CDC, health authorities and port authorities will be able to find a safe place for Grand Princess to put in very soon so that passengers may disembark either into a quarantine situation at a military base (as has been done before), or for further testing and care before being released to self-quarantine in their homes. Passengers of Grand Princess’ previous Mexico sailing are also being contacted directly by the CDC with further advice and instructions.

“We knew we were going to have a really good team next year, but the reason this team is so successful is because of our seniors. Our seniors bought in and were selfless. Their senior leadership let us expedite the process maybe a year early.”
 The Panthers’ seniors are guard Avery Hayes and inside players Kace Howard and Conner Linn.
 Western (17-7) advances to face Hammond (20-4) in the South Bend Washington Regional’s second semifinal game next Saturday. Hanover Central (23-2) and No. 4-ranked Mishawaka Marian (21-4) are in the first semifinal.
 In Saturday night’s sectional championship, Western got off to a tremendous start with the help of its suffocating defense. The Panthers led 16-1 before West Lafayette (13-11) scored its first basket of the game at the 7:32 mark in the second quarter.
 “The hole was too big. Give them credit because they played great at the start and we had a horrible start,” West Lafayette coach David Wood said. “Obviously a miserable eight or nine minutes. They have a very, very good basketball team. We fought, we fought hard, but against a good team you can’t get down 15.”
 The Red Devils finished the first quarter 0 of 7 from the field with three turnovers.
 “The start gave us some confidence,” Lewis said. “Obviously they have won it three times in a row and getting off to a good start was going to be a key component of the game. I thought our kids locked in defensively and made them really work for stuff.
 “The good start gave us confidence and we kind of held on from there. We talked a lot of this season that we have to have poise and if you don’t have poise in a sectional game you aren’t going to be able to close it.”

A fresh emergency package to be compiled on Tuesday, meanwhile, will likely include such steps as the launch of a zero-interest-loan system for small and midsize companies struggling to stay afloat as the virus scare dampens activities.
 Sports and music events have been cancelled and popular leisure spots such as theme parks closed to reduce mass transmission risks, while many are shunning shopping and eating out. Some economists say consumers are withdrawing even more than after the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, when a mood of restraint slashed spending.
 The economy shrank an annualized real 6.3 percent in the October-December quarter, the sharpest fall since 2014, as a consumption tax hike in October apparently took its toll.
 Martin Schulz, a senior research fellow at the Fujitsu Research Institute, said Japan's economy was already on its way to a technical recession before the coronavirus crisis began but that "unplanned" government actions, such as the school closures, are disrupting it further.
 Negative growth of as much as 1.5 percent is expected in the three months through March before a rebound in the July-September quarter as "the current mood of panic subsides," according to Schulz.
 "The big question is how badly trust in the effectiveness of Abenomics policies has been damaged," he said, referring to Abe's "three arrows" economic strategy.
 Potentially exacerbating economic ills, Japan is taking tougher border control measures to fight COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.
 From Monday to the end of the month, all those traveling from coronavirus- struck China and South Korea, including Japanese nationals, will be asked to stay in designated facilities such as hotels for 14 days, although the quarantine is not mandatory. On top of that, about 2.8 million visas issued to Chinese and 17,000 to South Koreans will become invalid, the Foreign Ministry said.
 The impact of restricting travel could be severe as visitors from the two countries accounted for nearly 50 percent of all travelers to Japan last year. Almost 80 percent of the 6.95 million visas issued in 2018 went to Chinese, with most for tourism purposes, according to ministry data.
 Economists at the Daiwa Institute of Research have estimated a negative impact of about ¥780 billion ($7.4 billion) on the economy, based on the assumption that the number of inbound tourists will fall by 4 million, including 2 million Chinese and 500,000 South Koreans, between February and April from a year ago.
 Uncertainty remains over whether the additional steps Abe has announced will help Japan bring the outbreak under control, while critics and opposition lawmakers say the measures came too late.
 "The right order should be to strengthen border controls first and shift to preventing the spread of the virus in the next phase," said Masato Imai, an opposition lawmaker.
 "Shouldn't the government have taken steps like a 14-day quarantine sooner?" Imai asked Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the top government spokesman, during a Diet session on Friday.
 The travel curbs coincide with the passing of the "two week" period that a government panel of medical experts said would be critical in determining whether Japan can rein in the infections.
 "Mr. Abe is increasingly pressed to do all he can to stem infections and turn the situation around as soon as possible," said Masahiro Iwasaki, a professor of political science at Nihon University.
 To seek cross-party cooperation, Abe in a rare move met separately with five opposition leaders to ask for support for the legal change needed for him to declare a state of emergency.
 Once declared, prefectural governors can instruct residents to stay indoors and ask for the cancellation of sports and entertainment events. They can also demand that medicine and other necessary goods be sold at lower prices or handed over, while urging train and logistic companies to transport medicine.
 Given the suppression of individual rights that a state of emergency would entail, there are calls being made — even within the ruling bloc — to draft clear criteria for triggering such a declaration. The law states that there must be an emergence of nationwide and rapid infections that are feared to have a serious impact on people's lives and the economy.
 "Any emergency declaration would raise public worries and we may see the sort of panic buying that we saw recently," Iwasaki said. "The impact on ordinary people needs to be carefully weighed. Most of all, what Japan does will be closely watched before the Tokyo Games."

The Warriors had practiced for this very situation.
 Trailing 45-42 with under 3 minutes remaining in the game, Philomath High’s boys basketball team needed to dig deep to avoid a major upset against No. 15-seeded Phoenix. Veteran coach Blake Ecker has often found answers to these situations through defensive strategy. And it proved to be the difference again in what ended up as a 48-45 victory Saturday night for the Warriors.
 “We’ve been doing some drills this last week where we have to get four stops in a row,” Ecker said. “That fourth stop is really hard and so we talked about that a little bit here. You’ve got to get those four stops, you have no choice but to get a stop. And they did it, they got the stop and they got some key rebounds when we needed them.”

 Orlando Sentinel
   
 ORLANDO, Fla. -- A day after cruising to the early lead in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, world No. 1 Rory McIlroy was just happy to walk away Friday mostly unscathed.
   
 A 1-over par, second-round 73 was seven strokes higher than McIlroy's opening 66. But at 5-under par, he was just two shots back of leaders Tyrell Hatton and Sung Kang and well in the mix entering the weekend at Bay Hill Club and Lodge.
   
 "It was a grind," McIlroy said. "I think I made it more of a grind than I needed to. But yeah, it was tough. I mean, conditions were tricky.
   
 "But all in all, I'm still right there in the golf tournament."
   
 Many were not so fortunate on a day filled with roller-coaster rounds, blow-up holes and heartbreak.
   
 To many in the 120-player field, Bay Hill must have resembled Mount Everest for golfers looking to scale the leaderboard, stave off the elements and survive a demanding test.
   
 Most people fell off the cliff during Friday's second round of the API.
   
 Palmer's golf course flexed its considerable muscle and might have been the day's big winner.
   
 Tricky winds, thick, three-inch rough and fast, crusty greens combined to bring many players to their knees and led to a Friday scoring average of 74.8 -- the highest since the first round in 2011.
   
 McIlroy guessed the late Palmer would have felt like a proud papa seeing Bay Hill -- long his baby following his 1970 purchase of the course -- challenge every facet of a player's game.
   
 "This is exactly the type of test that Arnold would have liked to see at his golf tournament," McIlroy said. "The weather's cooperated. It's been sort of cool and breezy. The greens have dried out. But the course is in phenomenal shape.
   
 "If you play well there are scores out there. But if you do get out of position you're going to struggle like I did today at times."
   
 During a four-hole stretch to end his opening nine, McIlroy went birdie-bogey- double bogey-birdie. Later after making 5 on the gettable par-5 16th hole, McIlroy said a 20-foot birdie putt on the daunting par-3 17th.
   
 Few avoided such dramatic swings during their rounds, other than players who spent their day in steady decline.
   
 First-round leader Matt Every followed a career-low 65 at Bay Hill with an 83 featuring four double-bogeys to miss the 3-over par cut by a shot.
   
 "Today was rough," he said.
   
 A day after a rock-solid 67 left him two shots behind Every, Talor Gooch shot 80 to make the cut on the number.
   
 World No. 10 Tommy Fleetwood would have traded two 76s for Gooch's first two rounds. A week after he contended at the Honda Classic until the final hole, Fleetwood never had a chance at Bay Hill to end a streak of 48 straight made cuts.
   
 "If you're gonna do it, do it properly and be dreadful on all fronts," Fleetwood said.
   
 Phil Mickelson, Adam Scott, Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson and Bubba Watson were among other big names not to make the weekend at Bay Hill.
   
 When the dust settled on Friday afternoon, just seven players had scored in the 60s, led by a 5-under 67 by Danny Lee, who is one shot back at 6-under.
   
 Joining McIlroy two shots back are 30-year-old American Harris English and 21-year-old South Korean Sungjae Im, who won last week at the Honda.
   
 "This is a really difficult course," Im said. "There is definitely a lot of strategy involved. I hope to play well this weekend."
   
 A day after winds exceeded 20 mph and record temperatures reached 92, the thermometer dipped more than 15 degrees Friday and somewhat lighter winds swept across Bay Hill's fast, firm fairways. Even good drives were ending up in the ankle-deep rough, leaving players with little chance to reach the green.
   
 Weekend forecasts are calling for cooler temperatures and breezy conditions, with gusts reaching at least 20 mph.
   
 "That's going to continue to be pretty tricky going into the weekend," McIlroy said. "You're going to see a lot of guys taking less and less club off tees just to make sure that they're holding fairways."
   
 This style of play could give a decided advantage to McIlroy, the longest and straightest driver left in the field. McIlroy is seeking his second API title in three years and fifth win on Tour since the 2019 Players Championship.
   
 But 10 other players in the top-50 are within five shots of the lead, including the 32nd-ranked Hatton. In 2017, Hatton tied for fourth during his first trip to Bay Hill.
   
 "That would obviously be amazing," the 28-year-old Englishman said. "The kind of next step in my career. We'll just see what happens."
   
 Whatever unfolds the final 36 holes should be interesting, unpredictable and exciting, especially when the leaders are coming down the stretch Sunday.
   
 McIlroy stormed to his 2018 win with a closing 64 during ideal scoring conditions to finish 18-under par for the week. The winner this weekend might have to claw and scratch his way even to reach double-digits under par and sit atop the leaderboard.
   
 McIlroy is confident he can rise to the occasion.
   
 "I think if I shoot two scores in the 60s and get myself to double digits under par, I think I'll have a really good chance," he said.
