Dylan Cuthbert, the lead programmer on _Star Fox 2_ , has provided running commentary on the _Star Fox_ leaks. At first, he was amazed that someone had uncovered a text tool he created almost 30 years ago, but later said he felt the leaks were “intrusive,” as they deal with private source code developed over years.
 It’s hard to overstate the enormity of the appropriately named Gigaleak. We are learning so much about old-school video games and prototypes that, in some cases, it’s completely changing history. Uncompressed _Star Fox 64_ voice files might seem like small potatoes among the huge revelations being dropped on a regular basis, but knowing these files are still floating around Nintendo somewhere does make one wonder why they haven’t been used in updated releases now that space is less of a factor.
 In any case, let’s hear it for my darling son Slippy and the rest of the Star Fox squadron. Your voices are finally, truly, being heard.

Two other formations should be mentioned. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, responsible for the administration of the country’s African population and the TTLs, where most guerrilla activity occurred, increased its military role as Rhodesia became a garrison state. By 1978-9 administration of large areas of the country was possible only in the presence of armed force. Internal Affairs personnel in the districts were invariably armed. The rank and file, made up mainly of District Security Assistants (DSAs), was generally low-calibre manpower, poorly trained, led and equipped (initially with .303 bolt-operated rifles, though they later received LMGs). The DSAs were in close contact with the African population of the TTLs, which meant that they were in close contact with guerrilla operations, with consequently high, morale-sapping casualty rates. The quality of the District Assistants (DAs) and paramilitary DSAs depended largely upon the quality of the District Commissioners who led them. As one police officer who worked closely with Internal Affairs, noted of the DAs and DSAs, ‘They died well and died en masse.’To try to counter insurgency in districts where leadership was poor, Internal Affairs set up the Administrative Reinforcement Unit (ARU). Despite its apparently innocuous name, this white-led force was ‘full of hard men’, according to one Rhodesian military historian. ‘Despite sounding like they checked paperclips, the ARU was very gung-ho and well-equipped.’

Ashish has been working towards participating in the Malle Moto class since 2019. He has been renting motorcycles from various race teams for international competitions that he has taken part in, but felt that they wouldn't work quite well for the Dakar Rally. So he decided to invest in a KTM 450 Rally Replica. He explained "We decided to invest in a rally bike for Dakar, and the KTM Rally Replica was a natural choice. The bike has been sitting in Spain since May, but with worldwide lockdowns and me being stuck at sea, I haven’t got a chance to ride it yet."

Apart from being fast, having quick reactions and navigating their way through the tough course, a top-competitor in the Malle Moto category needs to have a lot of knowledge about the motorcycle they are riding. This is because they will be the only ones responsible for all the repairs and maintenance that the motorcycle will need. "I’m looking forward to getting back out there training, not just on my riding and navigation, but also the technical skills that’ll be required for the Malle Moto. Dakar 2021 promises to be extra tough, let us hope we get back to doing what we love soon!" said Ashish, who is on the final leg of his journey at sea, before he returns to India in August.

Players will be able to inspect other players’ match histories from the next season as well. Anyone who completed their ranked placements in Act 1 will only have to play three ranked placement games in Act 2, instead of the regular 5. “Typically, your Match Rank will land a couple of tiers below where you ended the prior Act, but we’ll be increasing how heavily we weigh performance in your early games so you can quickly improve your matchmaking rank if you play well and win,” Riot says.
 It’ll be fun to see the community have a collective meltdown once Raze, Cypher, Viper and Killjoy all get into a team and start blanketing chokepoints with traps, AOE dots and all sorts of nightmares. There’s no release date on Killjoy just yet, but it shouldn’t be too far away.

If the regular army, police and the RAF were the mainstays of the Rhodesian security forces, the bulk of military manpower was engaged in less spectacular roles. It is a rule of thumb that the larger the formation the blunter the instrument. The major source of manpower for the Rhodesian armed forces was mobilization of reserves. The call-up net eventually encompassed all able- bodied white men between 18 and 60. All white youths between 18 and 25 were liable to conscription. The commitment eventually rose to 18 months, though those who would go on to universities had to serve 24 months since they would enjoy exemption from reserve duties while they were students. Men in the 25 to 38 age bracket were liable to reserve duty in the army, but were increasingly posted to other formations and services. Those who had missed national service conscription were first called up for training. Men over 38 were liable to serve in the Rhodesia Defence Regiment or the Police Reserve structure. The commitments of various groups differed. The most heavily pressed group were men in the 25 to 38 age bracket, who at the height of the war were liable to serve six months a year with their units. The pattern of tours became ‘six weeks in, six weeks out’, but even that was changed to ‘four weeks in, four weeks out’ in periods of acute manpower shortage, such as the traditional guerrilla rainy season offensives.

But it was in the transport of troops that the RAF played its most important role. Helicopters gave the Rhodesian forces the tactical flexibility they needed to control vast swathes of rugged countryside. The basic Rhodesian tactical element, the ‘stick’ of four or five men, was designed around the seating capacity of the mainstay of the helicopter capability of the Air Force, the Aerospatiale Alouette III. This machine was used not only for the rapid development of tracker and fighting teams, but was later the basis of Fire Force operations in the transport, command chopper and gunship roles, as well as being important for the evacuation (casevac) of the wounded. The force of 50-plus Alouettes, many on loan with their pilots and technicians from South Africa, was supplemented by a handful of Alouette II utility craft. Earlier in the war, the RAF had tried to acquire Pumas. Unlike the Alouettes which had been designed for civilian use, the Puma was specifically a military aircraft. As one senior Rhodesian air force officer lamented, ‘The UN mandatory sanctions made the sale of such equipment to Rhodesia impossible–even for the French.’ French technicians from Sud Aviation were nevertheless regular visitors to Rhodesia to advise on helicopter technology. A considerable boost to the airlift capability of the Rhodesian forces was the acquisition in 1978 of seven Bell 205s, the ‘Huey’ of Vietnam War fame, from Israel via the Comoro Islands. With a capacity of 12 to 16 men, each Bell could carry the equivalent of a former Fire Force of three to four Alouette IIIs. Cheetah was the name given to the Bells, which arrived in an appalling state. Without any manuals, they were completely overhauled, after ‘removing tons of sand’, according to a technician who worked on them.

One unsuccessful expedient adopted was that of integrating inexperienced troops with battle-hardened units. The RAR’s battalions were used to try to give a quick patina of combat experience to large numbers of recruits who were given shorter than usual periods of basic training from 1978. This experiment had limited success, but the attempt to integrate the previously all-white Rhodesia Regiment battalions was a disastrous failure. The racial prejudices of the territorial soldiers and the inexperience and unreliability of the African recruits caused morale among the whites to plummet. The white territorials alleged that the Africans displayed cowardice under fire, and resentment against this invasion of a former white preserve was reflected in lower combat effectiveness.

Like all the armed forces, the police suffered from a shortage of quality manpower. This was partly alleviated by the allocation of part of the national service intakes for each year from 1973, and the greater responsibility of reserve units to assist in preventing and detecting crime in urban areas and the safer rural districts. Increasing reliance was also placed on black recruits, who made up the rank and file, and the stretching of white officers’ responsibilities.

One major reason COVID-19 is raging out of control across much of the country: the current system of testing catches only a tiny fraction of people while they are contagious.
 It's now clear as many as 40% of people who contract the coronavirus that causes the disease don't know they have it. Others are contagious a few days before they know they're sick. If more people knew when they were infectious, they would likely stay home and not pass on the virus, slowing or even stopping the outbreak.
 But the test that's most commonly used to diagnose COVID-19, known as a PCR test, requires analysis in a lab using expensive equipment. With the current surge in cases in Southern and Western states, and a shortage of supplies to run the tests, it routinely takes three to five days - often a week or longer - to return results.
 More than 750,000 tests are conducted a day in the United States with more than 50,000 new positives nearly every day this month.
 A growing chorus of scientists argue that while PCR may be a good tool in hospitals to identify precisely how much virus a patient is carrying, it's not enough to stop the pandemic.
 Instead, people need to know they're contagious when they're contagious, which means they should be tested at least a few times a week.
 "That could be one of our most important interventions as we come into the fall to prevent large outbreaks from happening," said Stephen Kissler, a research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
 "I'm on board with (this) thinking," agreed Dr. Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of the clinical virology laboratory at Stanford University. "I think that would be quite useful."
 Someone who tests negative could visit an aging parent or grandparent without worrying about risking their lives. Teachers could walk into their classrooms with confidence, knowing that no one was harboring the virus. The dental chair would get a little less scary.
 "We still are not in a circumstance where we have quick turnaround diagnostics the way we need," Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health said in Friday webinar.
 Making tests faster, cheaper, easier
 A rapid, low-cost diagnostic is technologically feasible and getting closer to reality.
 At Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researchers are collaborating with a team at 3M to develop and scale such a test. Before the pandemic, MIT chemical engineer Hadley Sikes had developed prototypes to detect malaria, tuberculosis and dengue.
 If one for COVID-19 works, it could deliver results within 10 minutes. All someone would need to do is add a bodily fluid to a specially made piece of paper that changes color to indicate a positive or negative. No formal training or fancy machines needed.
 The National Institutes of Health is supporting development of this test and others with money, daily advice and a Shark-Tank-like competition, Sikes said. It's part of a $1.5 billion federal initiative called Radical Acceleration of Diagnostics (or RADx) to speed the pace of diagnostic development.
 "The world needs as many useful tests as possible as fast as possible," Sikes said.
 Her team's goal is to develop millions of these pregnancy-test like diagnostics every day, first in the United States and then around the world. Although Sikes said she couldn't commit to a specific timeline, theoretically, tens of millions of these tests could be produced in time for the start of school in September.
 How much does accuracy matter?
 An early review of this type of rapid test showed it accurately identified people with COVID-19 only about half the time. But it was the right half, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, who has been leading the effort to develop a fast, frequent testing approach.
 This test might miss some people with low levels of virus in their system, but most of those would already be on the road to recovery, with such low levels they'd unlikely be contagious.
 Whether you're infectious or not depends on how much virus your body is producing, Sikes said.
 As someone is falling ill, the virus reproduces incredibly quickly, so they wouldn't stay at low levels for more than a few hours, Mina said on a recent This Week in Virology podcast. Odds are slim the person would test themselves in that exact window and miss a burgeoning infection.
 And even if the test overlooked a few infected people, another test a few days later when they are more infectious would almost certainly be positive, Mina said.
 Dave O'Connor, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said tests can miss lots of people with low levels of the virus and yet have a profound impact on transmission.
 "You'll still have some embers" with a rapid, less accurate test, O'Connor said. But much of the COVID-19 transmission seems to come from super-spreaders - people with extraordinarily high viral loads in a position to infect a lot of other people. "If that's correct, then those are the people you'll need (to identify) to extinguish much of the fire."
 And a rapid test taken frequently should be able to do that.
 There would still be a role, O'Connor and others said, for PCR testing, in doctor's offices and hospitals, where a precise diagnosis could be crucial for treatment. Other types of tests are also in use or under development, each with strengths and weaknesses, suitable in different contexts, said Stanford's Pinsky, who is developing another type of test, as is O'Connor.
 Waiting on regulatory approval
 A big hang-up now is that regulators haven't yet signed off on this type of rapid test, out of concern for its accuracy. And companies are not pursuing approval for such tests, because they don't think the FDA will give its okay, Mina said.
 "No one is stepping forward because the message they are receiving clearly from the FDA is that the tests must approach the analytical sensitivity of PCR," he said. "But this should not be the criteria. It neglects how the tests are used."
 For its part, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it has approved six so-called point of care (POC) tests, which return results quickly - though these cannot be done without a lab or a trained professional.
 "For accuracy/sensitivity of POC tests, the FDA remains committed to facilitating the availability of reliable, efficient diagnostic tests for COVID-19," according to FDA spokeswoman Nicole Mueller. "The agency considers the level of sensitivity in connection with the potential benefits and potential risks of any diagnostic test when evaluating an (Emergency Use Authorization) request."
 Daniel Larremore, a co-author with Mina on the paper reviewing the tests, said regulators may be particularly leery of allowing less sensitive tests because of criticism they faced earlier in the pandemic. To try to relieve a logjam of testing in March, the FDA opened the door to more than 200 antibody tests, later recalling authorization for many that proved useless.
 "There may be some scars there from the past decision," said Larremore, a mathematician and assistant professor at the University of Colorado Boulder's Biofrontiers Institute.
 The FDA's rules are well intentioned, said O'Connor, but providing the highest quality of data may not be as important when so many people are sick and suffering.
 "The enormous burden of cases right here and now and the impact it's going to have on society, especially when schools have a tough time reopening, demands innovation, demands creativity, and demands that the government enable types testing and types of novel approaches that might never be considered under other, non-pandemic situations," he said.
 Nate Grubaugh, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University, said it's unlikely enough rapid tests could be made quickly enough to transform the pandemic. And he worries that while each individual test would be low-cost, doing them repeatedly would end up being expensive, creating another disparity between poor and wealthy communities.
 Fundamentally, "speed and availability of testing need to go up dramatically across the country," said Grubaugh, who is developing a test that relies on saliva instead of sampling from the upper nose as is done with PCR tests. "It'll be a combination of lots of things that get us there."
