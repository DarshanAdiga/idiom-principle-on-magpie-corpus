Despite the off-screen drama at NBC’s Today show and growing buzz about ABC’s success with Good Morning America , the network morning-show ratings so far this season are relatively calm. Season-to-date, NBC is still cock of the walk from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. in households, adults 18-49 and adults 25-54. And it caps the night in the top spot as well, with Leno continuing to dominate. Compared to the same period a year ago, Today is off just a tenth of a rating point to a 4.4 rating/16 share in…

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (WBRC) - University of Alabama System Board of Trustees announced Monday three Confederate plaques that honored former students who served in the Confederate Army were removed to be placed in a more appropriate historical setting.But conversations whether that was the right thing to do could continue for some time.On Tuesday, crews used heavy equipment to remove a huge piece of stone that once had a Confederate plaque attached to it.That sight made Lee Albritton happy. “We are real pleased the Confederate monuments are not here, but all over, are being removed,” he said.Albritton said his grandfather Joseph Neely Miller came to the University in 1865 as a 15-year-old cadet to protect the University of Alabama from Union troops during the Civil War.One of the three plaques that honored cadets like Miller were removed before that stone was taken away.“I grew up in the segregated south. So I know the evils of that. And the south fought the Civil War to keep slavery and he certainly would be totally against that. Some people think the plaques and stone should have been allowed to stay in place," said Albritton.“We can’t crush everything from the past. A lot of it was wrong. Totally agree. But you need to move on. If you start crushing everything you don’t agree with the history of the United States and the world, then you have nothing to look back on, nothing to research history,” Dale Vandagriff expressed.There is now a clear view in front of Gorgas Library with the historical marker gone."Alabama, we’ve come a ways. But we have a long way to go,” Albritton continued.The names of several buildings on the UA campus are also under review because of the backgrounds of some of the people they are named after. A special committee of UA trustees will make a report with recommended changes that will be made before the Board of Trustees at a future public meeting.Copyright 2020 WBRC. All rights reserved.

On June 6, the Y hosted a Greater Lansing Food Bank mobile food pantry, sponsored by DayStarr, with Owosso Rotary Club volunteers helping to feed more than 250 families. The Y worked with the Hunger Network, helping to connect those in need with area food pantries.
 Shiawassee Family YMCA staffers have been making wellness check phone calls to the organization’s older members.
 “(We did it) just to touch base, relieve some loneliness and to offer support if anybody had unmet needs,” Archer said. “We remain committed to actively partnering with other nonprofits in the area to help and support the greater Shiawassee community.”
 Those joining in the Virtual 5K can submit their time and a finish-line photo to be shared with all participants. Registered runners can support the Michigan YMCA of their choice through the entry fee of $35.
 In addition, participants will receive a race bib, and early registrants are guaranteed a T-shirt and commemorative finishers medal. Registration is open until June 15.
 Runners are asked to complete their races by June 30 and share their experience by using #MIYMCA on social media. Signup details are available at michiganymca.org/statewide-virtual-5k.html.
 The Shiawassee Family YMCA is currently closed, but Archer said facility employees are looking forward to the day when members can be welcomed back.
 “We are part of an amazing community — one where folks care about each other and help take care of each other,” she said. “As we deep clean and work on preparing the facility for social-distanced experiences, at least for a little while, what makes us most excited is to have our Y family back together.
 “We’ve missed them and can’t wait to have them join us again!”

ARCHBOLD — The Northwest State Community College Foundation recently awarded $661,000 in scholarships to 282 students from the region. The total dollars awarded surpasses last year’s record totals, offering needed financial help to students through the generosity of donors to the NSCC Foundation.
 The college premiered a virtual reception, to celebrate the accomplishments of the students and offer gratitude for the support of local donors.
 “COVID-19 may have kept us from meeting in person this year, but the foundation was determined to put a great celebration together,” said Robbin Wilcox, executive director of development and the NSCC Foundation. “We wanted to make sure our learners knew how proud we are of their amazing accomplishments, and we wanted our generous donors to know how grateful we are for their support. It is through their generosity that these scholarships exist.”
 Due to COVID-19, the Scholarship Awards Reception was held as a prerecorded, virtual reception which premiered May 28 on the college’s official YouTube channel (YouYube.com/user/NorthwestStateCC). Elements of the video were filmed at the NSCC Archbold campus, as well as other locations throughout northwest Ohio. The event kicked off with opening remarks by NSCC President Dr. Michael Thomson and NSCC Foundation board chairman Peter Beck, each providing congratulatory remarks to both students and gratitude to the donors who make the scholarships possible.
 Adam Freels, NSCC Foundation Board member, provided the donor perspective, noting “It is truly inspiring to witness the great work of our community to make a difference in the lives of our students, who will then go on to make positive impacts with our local businesses and organizations.”
 The NSCC Foundation was established in 1978 to provide support for the students, people and programs of NSCC. For nearly 40 years, the foundation has remained true to its mission to enhance, expand and sustain Northwest State so that NSCC can continue to fulfill its mission of creating opportunities for transformational learning. The NSCC Foundation works diligently to raise much- needed funds for educational opportunities that directly and indirectly impact students.
 "The NSCC Foundation continues to work hard each year to increase funding to support our students through both scholarships and efforts to provide state of the art training equipment," noted Wilcox. "The NSCC Foundation is not only giving more scholarship dollars than ever before, they are also helping the college to develop and expand programs that will help both students and our business partners for generations to come." Additional information about the NSCC Foundation is available at NorthwestState.edu/nscc-foundation.

A boat carrying hundreds of Rohingya that has been at sea four months is off southern Thailand and contains been blocked from entering Malaysia’s waters multiple times, a senior Malaysian maritime official said Wednesday.
 The Rohingya on board the boat have now been supplied with food and fuel by syndicates from Thailand and Myanmar, the chief of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.
 “The boat carrying about 300 people is in Koh Adang island (waters). We believe that the vessel departed from Cox’s Bazar in February together with the one that successfully landed,” said Mohd Zubil Mat Som, the MMEA director- general, talking about a boat towed ashore at Langkawi, an island in northern Malaysia, on Monday.
 The 2nd vessel “made many attempts to enter Malaysian waters previously but failed because it was detected by our patrols,” he said.

 Hazel the terrier mix has been reunited with her family after more than eight days in the wild.
 Ashley Shaw and her boyfriend Jackson Stanton spotted Hazel by the Essex Street ramp to Route 1 Wednesday afternoon and safely corralled her.
 Shaw had spent countless hours over the last week searching for Hazel, who dug under a fence at her Adams Avenue home on June 1 and ran off.
 The Shaw family had received confirmed sightings of Hazel four nights in a row by a guardrail at the Essex Street ramp to Route 1.
 Shaw and Stanton were walking their golden retriever Zoey in that area Wednesday when they all of a sudden spotted Hazel.
 Shocked and overjoyed, Shaw called out to Hazel and asked her softly if she wanted to come home, holding her hand out so she could sniff it.
 Hazel approached the group and Shaw managed to grab her by the scruff, haul her over the guardrail and then clung to her to make sure she didn't escape.
 "I started screaming hysterically and crying, I couldn't believe it," Shaw said.
 Shaw took Hazel right to Dr. Duca at Saugus Animal Center for a checkup, which he offered free of charge. She had a few ticks, scratches on her ear and stomach, lost a few pounds and was running a high temperature likely due to overheating.
 "But she wasn't malnourished at all," Shaw said.
 Once back home, Hazel drained a bowl of water and played for a bit in the yard. Shaw reported she was slowly settling in as the afternoon went on.
 Shaw thanked everyone for their support in helping to find Hazel, including Missing Dogs Massachusetts, the Saugus Police Department, York Ford and McGarvey Towing.
 Special thanks from the Shaw family go out to those who spotted Hazel in recent days, starting with Selectman Corinne Riley and her husband Chris on Saturday night; Tyler Chisholm; Brendan McCabe; and finally James Cormier at about 2 a.m. on Wednesday.
 At last check Hazel was waiting to take a bath that Bobbi at Center Pet Care offered for free.
 Shaw is just happy to be able to hold Hazel in her arms after so many days of uncertainty. The pooch is relaxing and getting lots of snuggles from the family, she said.
 "We never gave up, we followed every lead we could," Shaw said.
