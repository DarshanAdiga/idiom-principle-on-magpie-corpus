During this time of uncertainty, it has become obvious that one of the most significant elements contributing to the anxiety of military families everywhere is the fear of not having enough supplies to eat. “The help that these Soldiers are providing, is making a big difference,” said Maj. Pedro Fernandez, Secretary to the General Staff at the 94th AAMDC. “The patrons who are in line outside the Commissary may not see the work that is happening behind the scenes, but to these Soldiers, it is important that our military families walk out of the Commissary feeling at ease that they have what they need for their families. After all, taking care of each other is a significant characteristic of the military community,” said Fernandez.

These are a segment of the population the government and endowed private sector interests need to succour as tighter curbs are being contemplated to enforce a lockdown aimed at arresting the spread of Coronavirus. They pose a volatile point in the architecture against the viral pandemic because they aren't just highly vulnerable - they do not have the funds to kit up with face masks, gloves and sanitisers and might not even care to report early symptoms of infection - they are to boot irrepressible owing to existential motivation.

Some of my conversations with then President Lee were conducted one-on-one, without interpreter or notetaker, so I could be blunt without forcing him to lose face before others. But my goal was always to avoid embarrassing or humiliating the elected leader of Taiwan, while at the same time making it clear we needed to work together to ratchet down the cross-strait tension this had kicked up. Looking back, I believe Lee was genuinely surprised by the ruckus this had fomented. With the frequent support of his Secretary General of the National Security Council, Ting Mao-shih (丁懋時), we worked out public statements that over time helped to defuse the situation.

Pearl Jam’s newest album, _Gigaton_ , is a collection of different sounds from the grunge icons. The single off the album, ‘Quick Escape’, is vintage Pearl Jam with the distorted guitar, bellowed vocals and political angst driving the song. While ‘Quick Escape’ is certainly the stand out track off the record — especially if you are looking for those angst filled 90s vibes — ‘Comes Then Goes’ is a ballad that deserves just as much attention.

Pritzker originally ordered schools closed through March but extended the order through at least April 7 as the state tried to get a handle on the pandemic by issuing a stay-at-home order through the same day. Chicago Public Schools suspended in-person classes at least through April 20.
 Both Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot have said they do not know when schools may be able to reopen, but Lightfoot predicted Friday that Pritzker’s stay-at-home order will last “deep into April.”
 The state board of education guidance issued Friday says districts should adopt a grading system of “pass” or “incomplete,” and students should be allowed to make up or do assignments over.
