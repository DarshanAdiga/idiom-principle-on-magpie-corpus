“We went into the system at two seconds after 3 o’clock and saw that every tee time until 6:30 p.m. was accessed by somebody,” said Chandler Withington, Hazeltine’s head golf professional. “Throughout the state, every course was packed.”
 Minnesota is a microcosm of the golf boom enveloping the United States as courses have reopened in the past month, a time when the percentage of golf courses open nationwide has surged from 44% to about 88%, according to the National Golf Foundation. There are more than 16,000 golf courses in the U.S. and only a quarter are private clubs. With schools padlocked, fitness centers closed and many parks and playgrounds off limits, golf — with social distancing restrictions — has become a rare outdoor respite that combines exercise, companionship, competition and space.
