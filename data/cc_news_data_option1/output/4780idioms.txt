The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested a 48-year-old MBA graduate for duping at least 22 people of ₹1.03 crore on the pretext of getting them jobs in the Railways.
 Deepak Kumar Sinha was on the run since 2018, when the Kharghar police filed an FIR against him based on a complaint by Mallappa Meti, a resident of Kharghar, that the accused had cheated him of ₹6 lakh.
 Assistant Police Inspector Krishna Mekle, EOW, Unit II, said the accused used to pose as a railway employee and lure job seekers from Gujarat and Jharkhand with posts such as travelling ticket examiner and train motorman. He would make them fill forged application forms and give them fake appointment letters after accepting money. He also cheated people by promising to get their tenders approved. “Though Mr. Sinha hailed from Bihar, he kept moving cities with his family. He also claimed to be a marketing professional. We are verifying these claims,” Mr. Mekle said.

 Development works to the tune of ₹ 2.69 crore, including concrete flooring at the bathing area and providing safety railings works, were completed recently. Works to lay approach roads to the anicut and construction of a wall are in progress. With the State government opening Hogenakkal and other tourism spots across the State with COVID-19 preventive measures, tourists wanted restriction on bathing to be lifted here.
 People who visit Bannari Amman Temple, make it a point to visit the anicut without fail.
 Small traders selling fish fries, snacks, and beverages at the anicut have lost their livelihood and wanted it opened to visitors at the earliest.
 Many traders said that in the absence of income, they had borrowed money at high interest rates, and only regular business would enable them recover from debts.

If the vaccine is successful, fulfilling that demand won’t be easy. In the U.K., a shortfall in supplies of the shot expected by the end of the year casts doubt on how swiftly AstraZeneca will be able to immunize the public. Yet the company has said it’s confident it can begin supplying hundreds of millions of doses on a rolling basis once it gains approval.

BJP activists went on a rampage at the party office at Nampally on Sunday at the denial of ticket to their leader from Gunfoundry division.
 They landed body blows and tore the shirt of Omprakash, husband of official candidate Surekha, when the couple arrived to collect their B-form. They also broke the glass panes of windows and ransacked furniture, eye witnesses said.
 The attackers were supporters of Goshamahal MLA T. Raja Singh, who recommended the candidature of Anitha but the ticket went to Dr. Surekha. Anitha’s husband, Shailender Yadav (Ramu), stormed the party office with his supporters to question the injustice to them.

Many GAA fans expected that Kerry would feature in an All-Ireland final this December, but few could have predicted that it would be the Kingdom’s hurlers heading to Croke Park.
 Victory over Carlow on Saturday afternoon in Tralee secured their place in the Joe McDonagh Cup final against Antrim, which will be a curtain raiser to the Liam MacCarthy decider, next month.
 Kerry boss, Fintan O’Connor, didn’t hide his excitement. “Croke Park is massive for any hurler or footballer around the country, as they dream about playing there. I heard Fionan (Mackessy) at the appeal hearing on Thursday, talking openly to the committee about how getting to Croke Park meant so much to him and how he did not want to cost his team-mates a chance of getting there.
 “So that brought home to me even more what it meant. If someone had offered you the chance to play your last match of the year at home, and then be just 70 minutes away from Croke Park, would you take it?
 “They all said, ‘Yes, we would’, so they went out today and they gave it everything. I am just delighted for them and I am really over the moon.”
 Kerry, thanks to two first-half Daniel Collins goals, led 2-12 to 1-10 at half time, with Jon Nolan getting an early Carlow goal. But Carlow fought back in the second half, due mainly to the free-taking of Marty Kavanagh, and when James Doyle fired over in the 65th minute, Carlow had taken a two-point lead, 1-23 to 2-18.
 But points from Shane Conway, Shane Nolan, and two from Michael O’Leary saw Kerry edge Carlow out by two points and reach their first Joe McDonagh final.

In the Associated Press article "Experts: Police brutality, racism pushing Black anxiety" (Nov. 1), one of the final points made was the need to hold hard conversations and depolarize American politics. However, I find that this is easier said than done, as people refuse to acknowledge that a system that has benefited them is inherently flawed.
   
 As an African American, I grew up being taught how to properly conduct myself if I ever encountered a police officer, and hearing stories from family members about "driving while Black." Now that the country has the mirror placed in front of all its citizens, instead of trying to reconcile the issues that create such a system we are met with rhetoric such as "blue lives matter."
   
 The hard conversations that should be had are cast aside as people do not wish to acknowledge the underlying racism and discrimination that has brought us to this moment.
   
 If we genuinely want to change the current climate, we need to do more than simply remove racially-charged symbols, and have those in power acknowledge the cause for this tension. This includes those whose constituents are composed of white supremacists to admonish this behavior, as well as voice that privilege is a very real concept openly and loudly. When this occurs, maybe we can begin to have these hard conversations that could lead to a less- polarized political environment.

 “No garbage collector has visited our residential colony for the last five days. Garbage bins and baskets are overflowing. We cannot dump garbage on street as it would attract penalty,” says an apartment dweller in SBI Officer's Colony..
 The issue was not confined just to residents of SBI Officers’ Colony. Several residents of Srirangam, Woraiyur and Thennur and extension areas also alleged irregular collection of garbage by sanitary workers.
 After abolition of road side garbage bins in the city about four years ago in favour of door-to-door collection of domestic waste, the residents were asked to segregate the waste into bio-degradable and non-degradable and keep them in two separate baskets.
 To habituate residents to the new practice, the Corporation distributed baskets through sponsors. After teething trouble, the system gradually became a regular practice. By deploying a light motor vehicle for each ward, the sanitary workers visited the households regularly to collect domestic waste.
 At one point of time, the Corporation even introduced a QR code-enabled garbage collection and tracking system to improve the efficacy of the door-to door collection. Though there were complaints of poor coverage here and there, the system had started gaining momentum.
 Now, the residents of several localities alleged that that the system had frittered away gradually due to irregular collection of domestic waste and the inefficient monitoring mechanism.
 Though the daily collection of waste was still in force, many alleged that it was only on paper. There were areas where daily collection of waste was being undertaken. In several other areas, the sanitary workers visited once in three to four days to collect garbage.
 Kalavathi Shanmugam, vice president, Exnora, Tiruchi, said that except some prominent areas, the efficiency of the system had, in general, taken a severe hit. The residents of interior and extended areas had been hit hard due to erratic door to door collection. The time was high for review of the overall functioning of the system. Steps should be taken to review the system in each and every ward.

As the grounded, Blackburn-born teen says, the learning process is ongoing and there cannot be a better engine room to watch from right now than Liverpool's.
 Sometimes accused of being more perspiration than inspiration, the criticism doesn't always stand up when taking a look at the last 12 months of action for Jurgen Klopp's seniors.
 Since June 1 last year, Klopp's men have won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup and stand within two wins of a Premier League crown with a 25-point advantage at the summit.
 But if there is one thing missing from the squad that is currently the world and European champions, perhaps it is a lock-picker in the No.10 role?
 Somewhere for Clarkson to try and make his mark, long-term, perhaps?
 He says: "I'd say I'm quite a technical player. I like to pass the ball, I like to get on the ball all the time, I'm always looking to play my mates in.
 "I'd say I can play a variety of the midfield positions – I can play as a No.6, a No.8 or as a No.10.
 "I played as a No.10 when I was 15 and playing in the U16s and scored quite a lot of goals.
 "Then I started to move back a little bit. But when Pedro Chirivella was playing with us, I was sort of like a No.8/No.10. I'd like to think I can play in either of those positions, which is a lot more helpful than playing in the one role."

Q. I am 35 and married with a 3-year-old kid. I work in the private sector. I would like to retire at 60 with a corpus of ₹3 crore. My present accumulated funds come to ₹38 lakh (including FD, PPF and LIC). I prefer to own an apartment in 5-6 years. Kindly guide me. My current CTC is ₹18.5 lakh.
 A. Mandal
 A. If you can save about ₹40,000 per month over the next 20 years, and allow your present corpus to grow, you should be able to reach your goal of ₹3 crore assuming a return of 7%. You may have to dip into this corpus to pay for buying your apartment. In such a scenario, you will have to increase your savings in later years a bit. Take stock then, after seeing how much corpus depletes when you withdraw to buy your house.

Trial successes from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. have buoyed hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine is coming soon. But much of the world, outside of rich nations like the U.S., is counting on another company’s shot to escape the crisis. Findings from the final stage of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine studies are due to be released shortly, and the stakes for lower- and middle-income nations are immense. The shot developed with the University of Oxford accounts for more than 40% of the supplies going to those countries, based on deals tracked by London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd. The Astra vaccine costs a fraction of the price set by Pfizer and will be manufactured in multiple countries, from India to Brazil. It should be easier to deploy far and wide than other shots that need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures. But if the U.K. partners can’t match the lofty efficacy levels Pfizer and Moderna delivered or roll out their inoculation quickly, the pandemic might continue spreading death and disease in countries relying on it. “There’s a lot riding on the Astra vaccine,” said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. For lower-income countries, “it’s huge.” 79349849 Pfizer applied Friday for an emergency use authorization in the U.S., and may begin the rollout in mid-December. While wealthy nations are in a position to receive the first supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna shots thanks to significant quantities they’ve snapped up in advance, most regions are depending heavily on companies following the front-runners, especially AstraZeneca, Novavax Inc. and Johnson & Johnson. Supplies will likely struggle to meet demand in the months after vaccines arrive, raising concerns about global access. Greater Population “The vast majority of the global population live in low- and middle-income countries,” said Mark Eccleston-Turner, a law and infectious disease specialist at Keele University in England. “It’s not just a problem for people over there, far away from us. This is a problem for most people in the world.” A global program called Covax has made strides in an ambitious effort to deploy future vaccines equitably around the world, getting dozens of countries to join and securing deals for 700 million doses so far. AstraZeneca reached an agreement to supply the initiative, while a collaboration including the Serum Institute of India agreed to accelerate the production of Astra or Novavax shots for low- and middle-income nations, priced at a maximum of $3 per dose, with an option to secure more. A Covax pact with Sanofi and partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc followed last month. The program, led by the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, expects more deals in the coming weeks. Pfizer and BioNTech, along with Moderna, remain in talks with Covax. AstraZeneca has easily been the most active in reaching supply accords. Of all the volumes committed globally, almost a third -- about 3.2 billion doses -- are set to come from the U.K. company, according to Airfinity. More than 50 lower- and middle-income countries would receive Astra and Oxford’s shot, in regions including Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe, along with wealthy governments too, the research group found. If the vaccine is successful, fulfilling that demand won’t be easy. In the U.K., a shortfall in supplies of the shot expected by the end of the year casts doubt on how swiftly AstraZeneca will be able to immunize the public. Yet the company has said it’s confident it can begin supplying hundreds of millions of doses on a rolling basis once it gains approval. Price Advantage One of the key factors behind the reliance on the Astra-Oxford vaccine is the initial price. Astra has said it won’t profit during the pandemic and that the vaccine will cost between $4 and $5 a dose, though health advocates worry what that company and others will charge when the crisis is deemed over. The U.S. agreed in July to obtain the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine in a deal that sets the price at $19.50 a dose, or $39 for a two-shot immunization, a level BioNTech said could become a benchmark for developed nations. Moderna said it’s charging $32 to $37 a dose for smaller deals and less for bigger purchases. “Those prices really risk putting vaccines out of reach for a lot of the world,” said Margaret Wurth, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in New York. Astra-Oxford also has advantages beyond cost when it comes to the rollout in low- and middle- income countries. The global scope of manufacturing eases worries about countries restricting exports, and the product should be easier to transport and store, according to Eccleston-Turner, the Keele expert. The jab importantly can be kept at refrigerator temperatures, while those from Pfizer and Moderna, based on novel messenger RNA technology, require freezing for longer-term storage and transport. That’s why so many countries are eagerly awaiting the Astra results and focusing on the next candidates, including those from China. Russia also plans to produce the Sputnik V vaccine in other countries such as India and Brazil. “All of the wealthy countries are now fairly well positioned,” said Moon, the health specialist in Geneva. For developing countries, “it’s not as if they have been sitting back and saying we’ll see what trickles down to us. They’ve been aggressively pursuing what they can with the means at their disposal.” --With assistance from Riley Griffin and Naomi Kresge.
