Vincent loved to go hunting, especially during deer season, because he loved being outdoors.

Vincent didn’t know any strangers and loved being out and about in the community socializing and helping others. He himself never asked for help and never kept a tally of his generous deeds. He never spoke badly of others. He was a loving husband and doting father.

Giorgio said that he understands why people liked 1997 as it was a delicious vintage that dazzled from the very beginning but that he preferred a wine like the 1996 that may have not been the same showstopper on release but in the right moment it can show a beauty and “elegance” that is beyond one’s imagination. In a way, it is like people - some are superstars that dazzle the world, and there is no doubt that the world needs people like that, but others, who have been doing their essential job for a long time, may not seem as special and perhaps even at times rough around the edges because they need some of that grit to accomplish the things that make the world go round. Right now the world is living in challenging times trying to battle an unfamiliar virus. In these times, the people who have kept their heads down working those jobs that are incredibly vital are being viewed in a new light that makes them the super heroes the world needs in this moment. The world will be forever changed at this point and when it comes to those vintages that last, or those people who are able to continue the grind, we will have a renewed appreciation that goes beyond the dazzle.

“There are many in Pennsylvania for whom English is not their first language, and we have been working to ensure that those individuals and groups are also getting these very important updates,” Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Friday. “If you have a friend or neighbor who needs this information in their native language, please share it.”

  More than 1.3 million people in Pennsylvania speak a language other than English at home, according to census information. Roughly 500,000 people in the state speak English less than “very well," and about half of those people speak Spanish.

NEW YORK -- The number of known coronavirus U.S. cases soared well past 115,000, with more than 1,900 dead, as President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was considering imposing a quarantine on the hard hit New York region.


  American healthcare workers in the trenches of the pandemic are appealing for more protective gear and equipment to treat a surge in patients that is already pushing hospitals to their limits in virus hot spots such as New York City, New Orleans and Detroit.


  Trump told reporters he could order a quarantine on three states, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which between them have recorded at least 64,000 infections and 895 deaths.


  He also appeared to soften his previous comments calling for the U.S. economy to be swiftly reopened. Asked whether he thought the United States would restart by Easter Sunday, April 12, Trump replied, "We'll see, what happens."


  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he had no details on any possible quarantine order for his state, telling a briefing: "I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that would be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don't know what you would be accomplishing."


  He said New York was postponing its presidential primary election to June 23, from April 28.


  As the crisis deepened, nurses at Jacobi Medical Center in New York's borough of the Bronx protested outside the hospital on Saturday, saying supervisors asked them to reuse personal protective equipment, including masks. Some held signs with slogans including "Protect our lives so we can save yours."


  "The masks are supposed to be one-time use," one nurse said, according to videos posted online. "Now, all of a sudden the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is saying that it's fine for us to reuse them. These choices are being made not based on science. They're being made based on need."


  One resident at New York Presbyterian Hospital said they were issued with just one mask.


  "This is your mask forever. You can bring it home with you. Here's how you can clean your mask," said the resident, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. "It's not the people who are making these decisions that go into the patients' rooms."


  Doctors are also especially concerned about a shortage of ventilators, machines that help patients breathe and are widely needed for those suffering from COVID-19, the pneumonia-like respiratory ailment caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus.


  Hospitals have also sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, oxygen tanks and trained staff.


  By Saturday afternoon, the U.S. number of cases stood at 115,842 with at least 1,929 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. The United States has had the most recorded cases of any country since its count of infections eclipsed those of China and Italy on Thursday.


  BLACK MARKET


  As shortages of key medical supplies abounded, desperate physicians and nurses were forced to take matters into their own hands.


  New York-area doctors say they have had to recycle some protective gear, or even resort to bootleg suppliers.


  Dr. Alexander Salerno of Salerno Medical Associates in northern New Jersey described going through a "broker" to pay $17,000 for masks and other protective equipment that should have cost about $2,500, and picking them up at an abandoned warehouse.


  "You don't get any names. You get just phone numbers to text," Salerno said. "And so you agree to a term. You wire the money to a bank account. They give you a time and an address to come to."


  Nurses at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York said they were locking away or hiding N95 respirator masks, surgical masks and other supplies that are prone to pilfering if left unattended.


  "Masks disappear," nurse Diana Torres said. "We hide it all in drawers in front of the nurses' station."


  One nurse at Westchester Medical Center, in the suburbs of the city, said colleagues have begun absconding with scarce supplies without asking, prompting better-stocked teams to lock masks, gloves and gowns in drawers and closets.


  An emergency room doctor in Michigan, an emerging epicenter of the pandemic, said he was wearing one paper face mask for an entire shift due to a shortage and that hospitals in the Detroit area would soon run out of ventilators.


  "We have hospital systems here in the Detroit area in Michigan who are getting to the end of their supply of ventilators and have to start telling families that they can't save their loved ones because they don't have enough equipment," the physician, Dr. Rob Davidson, said in a video posted on Twitter.


  Sophia Thomas, a nurse practitioner at DePaul Community Health Center in New Orleans, where Mardi Gras celebrations late last month fueled an outbreak in Louisiana's largest city, said the numbers of coronavirus patients "have been staggering."


  In the nation's second-largest city, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said spiking cases were putting Southern California on track to match New York City's infection figures in the next week.

RAPID CITY — In an effort to help local healthcare providers overcome a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology is 3D printing masks for Monument Health and other local healthcare providers.


  The project began following a meeting between Mines alumnus Brad Haupt, vice president of supply chain and contract management at Monument Health, Mines President Jim Rankin, and others on March 21. Haupt expressed a concern over the long-term shortage of masks at Monument Health, especially in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, and Rankin offered Mines resources’ to help.


  The effort, which quickly ramped up this week, currently includes faculty and students in the South Dakota Mines departments of industrial, mechanical, chemical, biological, and biomedical engineering as well as chemistry, biology, and health sciences. The departments are printing about 50 masks per day using up to 15 printers running nonstop. “We hope to print as many as we can,” said Jeffery Woldstad, head of the Department of Industrial Engineering at Mines. “Right now, we believe that we have the material on campus for about 1,000 masks. However, we are ordering more materials and will keep going.”

PLAINS TWP. -- This whole self-isolation/social distancing thing, while necessary, can be trying, to say the least.

_This editorial was published by the Post Register of Idaho Falls._


  ———


  In rough times, everyone gets the urge to save. That’s why we’ve seen so much hoarding in recent days.


  But it should be obvious by now how counterproductive that is. With hoarding, an individual or family takes more than they need, depriving their neighbors and causing other people to hoard so that eventually they too are deprived. But stocking up a bit, while leaving enough for others, makes us all better off.


  This isn’t just true at the grocery store. It’s true everywhere in our economy.


  In tough economic times, it’s easy to get the urge to cut your spending down to almost nothing. But any economist will tell you that in the aggregate, total spending is equal to total income. If everyone cuts their spending drastically, they won’t have any customers, and their income will also fall drastically.


  The economic numbers are very concerning right now. In the worst week of the 2008 recession, there were about 655,000 new unemployment claims. There were 180,000 in Pennsylvania this week, and though national figures have not been released, Goldman Sachs estimates there were 2.25 million this week.


  But this is not a permanent situation. This is happening because so many people are unable to work because it is necessary to fight COVID-19. And we will eventually beat it.


  The federal government is starting to react. Unemployment benefits surge automatically to respond to recessions. A massive stimulus package to get money in everyone’s pockets is being developed. Sick leave is being extended throughout the nation. Counties and cities are issuing emergency declarations to make more funds available. Closed schools are continuing to offer kids to- go meals.


  We can only get through this together through mutual aid and mutual support. That means continuing to provide support for businesses you have longstanding relationships with. It means continuing to support charities whose work will be desperately needed — a huge number of local charities have banded together to provide necessities, care and other aid to those in need.


  If you would normally go to a restaurant, see if they offer delivery or to-go service. And tip generously.


  If you would normally be buying something from a company, see if they offer gift cards.


  If you would normally get a haircut, ask if you can pre-pay for a future cut down the road — many of us will be looking a little shaggy before this is finished, and in need of a good trim.


  If you had planned to attend a local concert, don’t ask for your money to be refunded.


  If you have a gym membership, don’t cancel it. ... If you keep paying your dues, they can continue paying their employees.


  Through this crisis, we all need to learn to set aside selfishness. Though we need to maintain social distance, the only way we will get through this is if we come together in ways we never would have considered before.

If you leave your job at age 55 or older, you can take 401(k) withdrawals without penalty from the account at that job. If you roll a 401(k) balance over to a traditional IRA, you'll need to keep the amount in the account until you are at least 59 1/2 years old to avoid a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Transferring funds to a Roth IRA has different implications.

You'll also want to be aware of the tax implications of transferring funds to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Choosing to roll a traditional 401(k) over to a traditional IRA can be done without incurring taxes. The funds placed in a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA are both pre-tax, which means the money won't be taxed until you take a distribution. If you move funds from a traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA, you will usually be taxed on the amount transferred. When you move money into a Roth account you will pay taxes on the contribution now, but the future withdrawals are often tax-free.

 Barbara Syme Grupico Passed away peacefully on March 15th, 2020 at the age of 95 in Santa Rosa. Born to Irish and Scottish immigrants Barbara J. Lyons and John F. Syme in her favorite city of San Francisco on November 7th, 1924, she is preceded in death by her brothers Charlie, John, Francis and her parents. She is survived by brother William Bill, her children Barbara Ann and Brian Charles (Joan) and her beloved grandchildren Seamus, Bridget, William, Vincent, Paul (Alicia) and Steven, nieces Kathleen and Denise, and nephews Bud, John and her great grandchildren. Although Barbara relocated from her cherished San Francisco to Windsor in 1990 to help raise her grandchildren, her heart belongs in San Francisco where the heavy fog rolls in over the hills. In her later years, Barbara enjoyed playing the piano, reading and feeling the sun on her face in her beautiful tree and flower filled backyard. Always known to be a great host and a women of the highest class, Barbara was also a great mother and an even better grandmother. She will be missed dearly, remembered fondly and thought of frequently as she looks down from above, free of the pain she suffered through in her last years. Private Rosary and Requiem Mass will be celebrated at St. Teresa's Catholic Church in San Francisco on April 2nd followed by her being laid to rest at Holy Cross Cemetery with her treasured family, which was her greatest joy and source of pride. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Catholic Charities on her behalf.

“It occurred to us that we had an opportunity to engage the people who know how to sew or are interested on work on projects, something they can do from home,” she said.


  First Freer contacted the medical professionals at Monument Health to determine what sort of specifications would need to be met.


  “One-hundred-percent cotton masks have to be made out a woven fabric like a batik fabric or a high quality quilting cotton because of the weight of the fabric,” she said.


  Freer also encountered a problem with the lack of elastic, which she solved by utilizing T-shirt material.


  “T-shirts are great when they’re cut into strips to be used to hold the mask on,” she explained.


  Once she had a working prototype, she was able to obtain enough material to get the project started. With the assistance of a Spearfish Community Foundation grant, the group purchased 200 yards of fabric and got underway.


  “We saw a group of people coming together to fulfill an urgent need in our medical community. We value our healthcare workers and are so grateful for their service. The Spearfish Community Foundation wants to do anything we can to help them continue to do their job, while helping to keep them safe and healthy as well,” said Liz Manning, Spearfish Community Foundation board president.


  Friends of the Northern Hills Training Center also contributed to the cause, which brought the total up to $4,500.


  “So we’re looking at ways we can partner with the training center, they have a number of people who do sewing there and have been sewing masks so now we’re working to get them the patterns,” Freer said.


  The Salvation Army in Spearfish also reached out to Freer and will be acting as a drop off point for materials.


  “We realized there was a need to clean anything that was donated … so we reduce potential contamination,” Free said.

Most auto dealers and service stations are keeping their doors open during the coronavirus pandemic, saying they should not be forced to close because they provide an essential service.


  Dealers, who have been hit hard by the crisis already, say their businesses are essential to many Americans who need to buy or fix cars to get to their jobs or other critical destinations like hospitals.


  "You have millions of workers who still have to get to their jobs in health care and all types of industries like that, and they need their vehicles," said Marc Cannon, chief marketing officer of AutoNation, the country's largest dealer network.


  To make people comfortable, dealers are practicing social distancing in their showrooms, offering to deliver purchased vehicles, allowing solo test rides and eliminating certain in-person activities to make a purchase.


  They're also offering steep discounts in the form of incentives passed along by the auto manufacturers, which are scrambling to keep selling vehicles. Auto sales are expected to drop sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


  In some states, like New Jersey and Michigan, dealerships have been forced to close their showrooms due to stay-at-home orders but can keep their service departments open. In others, like Ohio, they can keep both operating, according to trade journal Automotive News. Details of each state's so-called shelter-in-place directive vary. In Massachusetts, gas stations and auto repairs are considered essential, and vehicle sales can still happen -- just not in person.


  Most of AutoNation's 325 locations are still open - and recently received shipments of 10,000 hand sanitizers -- but many customers are taking steps to schedule free delivery of vehicles they've purchased or want to test drive, Cannon said.


  At Sonic Automotive, one of the country's largest dealer networks, it's a similar story. Most of Sonic's stores are open, with the exception of certain locations in California, which has a shelter-in-place order.


  "People don't have to worry about coming into contact with our staff," said David Smith, president of Sonic Automotive. "We're disinfecting the cars before and after the test drives, we're disinfecting all the areas in service and sales."


  And, "if somebody wants us to come to their home and deliver a car to them, we'll do that. We can also come to their house and pick up their car for service."


  Smith said it's vital for service departments to remain open to help customers who still need to get to their jobs. But he said it's also important for showrooms to remain open so that customers who need to replace their vehicle can do so, instead of spending thousands on a car that shouldn't be repaired.


  "Can you imagine the panic that would be caused if the public could not get to the grocery store, If they couldn't get to the hospital, if they couldn't get to vital places?" Smith said.


  Sonic is also practicing what Smith called "no-contact sales and service" and is encouraging customers to fill out most of their paperwork online.


  "They can do about 90% of the transaction online on our website," he said.


  Used car retailer CarMax has temporarily closed at least 39 of its more than 210 locations, including all 27 in California. Like many other dealerships, CarMax is offering customers the option to test-drive vehicles alone if they're uncomfortable riding along with a dealership employee.


  At Carvana, which advertises itself as a "car vending machine," "some" locations are closed but customers can arrange for a "contactless delivery" if they live nearby, the company said in a statement. Customers can take delivery of a vehicle without interacting with the person who arrives in the vehicle hauler.


  Auto sales fall off during coronavirus


  Auto sales are expected to drop because of COVID-19, as Americans hold off on major purchases, much like they did during the Great Recession, which triggered the bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler.


  At the beginning of the year, forecasts called for 2020 U.S. auto sales of somewhere in the mid-16-million range. But the full-year figure could drop below 14 million in a "full-blown recession," Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs said in an email.


  The number of people shopping for a new vehicle fell by 25% in the first half of March, compared with a year earlier, according to data source Comscore.


  The National Automobile Dealers Association has asked federal, state and local governments to ensure that their members are not prevented from operating because of shelter-in-place orders. The group also wants Congress to include "short-term liquidity for dealerships" through loan guarantees and other measures in the next stimulus package.


  "Just like every business, business has been off," Smith said. "There's certainly a slowdown but we believe that's temporary."


  Coronavirus car deals


  Automakers have offered a slew of incentives to customers. For example, Ford is offering to make three months of new-car payments on behalf of customers, Hyundai is offering to make payments for six months if customers lose their jobs due to the coronavirus and GM is offering 0% financing for 84 months for certain buyers.


  "The manufacturers have been very supportive. They've come out with incredible offers," Cannon said.


  Autotrader's Krebs said it could be a good time for some people to take the plunge.


  "Great time to buy a vehicle if you dare to venture out," she said. "Sales have fallen off, dealerships remain open and automakers are supporting dealers and consumers to purchase."


  While COVID-19 is a significant crisis for the auto industry, it's also presenting an opportunity of sorts for certain services.


  For example, AutoNation is fielding a surge of interest in its Clorox Total 360 sanitizing service, Cannon said.


  The 30-minute, $29.99 service kills 99.9% of bacteria on hard and soft surfaces inside vehicles. AutoNation is offering the sanitizing service for free to first responders in certain markets.

In most respects, Gamedec looks and plays like a traditional isometric RPG that takes players through a variety of environments ranging from a "deceitful farm-like environment, through dark-noir cyberpunk realities to fantasy-based realms." Here, however, rather than focus on combat, the game tasks players with using only their wits to "gather info from witnesses and suspects, get to the bottom of deceptive schemes, save lives, and investigate the extraordinary relationships between virtual worlds and their inhabitants." Roleplaying is nevertheless a core component, emulating the "nature of a tabletop RPG by focusing on multiple, choice-dependent, character-building scenarios." With numerous decisions to make and professional skills to upgrade, players are "given the freedom to approach situations from multiple angles rather than forcing a single solution &ndash; the choice is yours and yours alone." Of course, for every choice there is a consequence, which could be "immediate, long-term, or stay hidden, surfacing when least expected."

The Shawnee County Jail's inmate population has dropped by 22% in 11 days, at a time when District Attorney Mike Kagay is responding to the coronavirus crisis by seeking to make bond more affordable for nonviolent inmates.


   


  Kagay told The Topeka Capital-Journal this week that his office has been reviewing bonds for inmates being held in connection with nonviolent offenses.


   


  "It is my position that these offenders should be released from the jail, as they do not pose a significant risk to public safety," he said by email. "We are working with the courts and defense counsel in order to accomplish this in an efficient and orderly manner."


   


  The jail had 413 inmates in-house on Friday, compared to 529 on March 15, said Maj. Tim Phelps, of the Shawnee County Department of Corrections.


   


  That decrease comes at a time when inmate populations are being reduced at numerous jails nationwide in an effort to mitigate the potential spread of the coronavirus in confined quarters.


   


  The Shawnee County Jail is not built for social distancing, Phelps said Friday in an email.


   


  "Inmates share cells, including bunks," he said. "We encourage continual personal and area cleaning, as well as social distancing to the extent it can reasonably be accomplished. When inmates are not in their cells, they are encouraged to maintain distance from one another and from staff."


   


  Many of the Shawnee County Jail's inmates have been there since before the coronavirus pandemic was identified in this community, Phelps noted.


   


  "So, the bigger risk we face is the virus coming in with new inmates, staff or visitors," he said. "That's why we screen everyone entering our facility to determine the presence of any risk. We also have medical protocols to be alerted immediately if an inmate reports any symptoms that may look like the work of this virus."


   


  Thankfully, Phelps said, those protocols have enabled jail officials to contain every such inmate until they have been able to rule out the presence of the virus.


   


  "So far, we have been very fortunate and have found no indication of COVID-19 in our population," he said.


   


  Shawnee County Jail officials lack the legal authority to hold or release any person, Phelps added.


   


  "That authority comes from law enforcement, the district attorney and the courts in various respects," he said. "When we're told by the appropriate authority to hold a prisoner, we hold the prisoner. When we're told by the appropriate authority to release the prisoner, we release the prisoner."


   


  Still, Phelps said, jail officials have encouraged law enforcement, the district attorney's office and the courts to arrange during the current coronavirus crisis for the jail to house only those who need to be there for the safety of the community.


   


  Kagay said his office evaluates inmates' bonds on a case-by-case basis.


   


  "However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, I am evaluating the bond on all nonviolent offenders in part because that is our normal course of action, but also because the pandemic has caused delays in cases," he said. "If the offender is not a significant risk I want to ensure they are not being held longer than necessary."


   


  Kagay said he has been personally reviewing cases of many Shawnee County Jail inmates, and seeking input on others from his team of prosecutors.


   


  "We always re-evaluate cases to determine if bond modifications are appropriate," he said. "Every accused is entitled to a bond and it is up to the court to set an appropriate bond. When setting bond, the court should set bond in an amount high enough to assure the accused will appear at future hearings and also ensure community safety (setting a bond high enough to deter further criminal activity)."


   


  Kagay said his office is simply re-evaluating bond amounts, on a case-by-case basis, to determine if modified bonds would be appropriate.


   


  He said his concerns in re-evaluating those amounts are to keep the community safe while ensuring inmates show up for scheduled court appearances.


   


  "Each request for bond modification will be evaluated based on that inmate's individual circumstances, including but not limited to: severity of the crime, criminal history, ties to the local community and history of failing to appear," Kagay said.


   


  He added that he makes a regular practice of objecting to the release of any defendant who poses a significant risk to public safety.


   


  Phelps said county jail officials appreciate that law enforcement, the district attorney's office and the courts are taking into account "the real risk of detention under this global pandemic."


   


  He added, "We appreciate and respect the difficulty in those decisions and we are thankful for the partnerships we have built in this process."

If you remember the PCR works by amplifying minute amounts of DNA. It therefore is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that’s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a few virus kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you you need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can’t determine if a osteogenesis is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.

Giorgio was born and raised in Turin, Piedmont, studied enology in Alba and he has worked his whole career working with Barolo wines and so Barolo is in his blood. As he presented wines from 1996 through 2015, he expressed his opinion about the three different eras of Barolo. “The first was in the 70s where everything happened by chance, no controls, no studies, everything was based on moon phases and the climate was cooler and rainier” Giorgio started off. “The second era was from the 80s to 2000 and all the vintages were expected to be very rich, deeply colored, ready to drink, so everything was standardized and selling Barolo was the main goal of every winemaker and owner” he stated with a knowing look of someone who lived through it “and the third era is all about the farmer and winemaker walking the same path.” In regards to the third era, he noted that the winemaker thought at one time that he was the creator of the wine but that is no longer true today; instead, the winemaker is the person who “preserves at maximum what the grapes can give.” Considering these eras, it is no wonder that 1996 was not considered an initial success across the board and that 1997 was considered the wine easier to sell on release.

An MP called for a chat on Friday morning as he drove through his electorate.


  On one side of the road he passed the local Centrelink office and a queue of the newly unemployed stretching 300 metres.


  On the other, he saw a swarm of police raiding a local brothel, where all concerned were evidently flouting the ban announced this week on such "personal services".


  For some, this crisis is devastatingly real. For others, it doesn't seem to exist.


  There is a fault line, too, when it comes to how best to tackle the coronavirus. A fault line that deepened this week.


  The "lock-downers" argue tighter restrictions are the only way to stop the virus spreading. They also reckon this will mean the least economic cost in the long run. It's a twin argument to save lives and jobs.


  Jacinda Ardern, Boris Johnson and plenty of medical experts fall broadly into this category.


  Anthony Albanese has also been pressing the case for more urgent steps now. "If we think we're going to take action next week, we should take that action today," he says.

The nearly 900-foot-long USNS Comfort, which was once an oil tanker, is a floating trauma hospital designed to care for service members who've been in combat.


  But on this mission, it will essentially serve as a community hospital.


  "What we're bringing to the people of New York is a hospital ship with a maximum capacity of 1,000," said Capt. Patrick Amersbach, the commanding officer of the medical treatment facility aboard the Comfort.


  The ship has 12 operating rooms as well as radiology suites and a CT scanner. It also has ICU beds, a lab and a pharmacy.


  The 1,100 or so medical staff on board are mostly active duty service members from the U.S. Navy, and some reservists, who serve on the East Coast.


  "I really want to thank the families - those who are staying behind," Amersbach said. "Because this is a national crisis. And their loved ones are leaving to go north to help those in New York. I really appreciate what they're doing and the sacrifices they are making."


  The arrival of the oblong ship, with its white hull and red crosses, is often a signal of the severity of a crisis.


  Since the current iteration of the USNS Comfort launched in 1987, the vessel has responded to wars in the Middle East, Hurricane Katrina and New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.


  But the current mission is unprecedented in the ship's century long history, which stretches back to World War I.


  "We've never deployed a hospital ship stateside specifically for a response in a global pandemic," said André B. Sobocinski, a historian for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.


  The closest the USNS Comfort has come to being in a situation like this was during World War I and the flu pandemic, Sobocinski said.


  The ship ferried soldiers from Europe back to the states, and some of the men most likely had the flu. The Comfort also handled overflow soldiers from military hospitals in New York. The difference now is that the ship is handling overflow from civilian hospitals in the city, Sobocinski said.

It’s unfortunate that Markkanen’s future is so murky after the promise he showed to start his career. He enjoyed a stellar rookie campaign, averaging 15.2 points and 7.5 rebounds to earn a spot on the All-Rookie First Team. While an elbow injury cost him the beginning of the 2018-19 season, he played pretty well when he returned in December and then blew up that February.

Relativity, on the other hand, is positioned to focus its adaptive capabilities on meeting customer needs. Using its flexible manufacturing floor of the future, the firm has already demonstrated the ability to quickly scale their launch vehicle size from 5ft to 7ft in diameter in order to accommodate larger payloads. Seeing a growing number of very small launchers like Rocket Lab’s very successful Electron rocket and the soon-to-fly Virgin Orbit air launched system, Relativity decided to move to a bigger rocket. Ellis and Noone saw a sweet spot between the small vehicles and what ULA and SpaceX were offering. Plus, SpaceX appears to be moving upstream to a much bigger system and that could leave a nice hole in the market. Noone says moving to this new market wasn’t hard at all, but rather a matter of, “Just stretching it and making it bigger, but not redesigning everything from scratch.” No other firm could have done that without redesigning the factory, changing their parts manifest and adapting a complex supply chain.

During this time of tremendous economic upheaval, we all understand the desire to jumpstart our economy. But we really hope the president is taking sound advice from medical experts.


  “Any decision we make has to be based on the data,” Fauci said Thursday on CNN’s Global Town Hall, “Coronavirus: Facts and Fears.”

  Ultimately, we all need to stay safe. Consumer Reports is suggesting taking extra precautions when grocery shopping — beyond staying 6 feet apart. Other tips include things such as washing fresh produce and wiping your hands and cart with germicide before and after shopping.


  Cancellations and social distancing are becoming the norm in the short term. Hopefully, this will flatten the curve and stop the pandemic’s spread in the long term.

Benefit from Compounding: Long term investment in Axis Focused 25 Fund allows investments to benefit from the power of compounding. To put it in simple words, compounding in mutual funds refers to the returns earned on the interest or profits made on the profits from your investments. Power of compounding may help smaller investments to grow and fetch better returns in the long run. So, if investors choose to stay invested for longer period of time, they might get more benefit from compounding.

So worry no more about the hassle of getting off your scooter at the fuel pump, opening the seat and then filling fuel.

The coronavirus pandemic has upended the lives and finances of millions. A federal relief package aiming to provide payments to distressed consumers passed Friday — but that money is not likely to land for a number of weeks.


  While you'll have to wait for whatever money you might be eligible for, now is the time to prep your finances and plan. The best use of this money depends on your individual circumstances. Here’s how to think it through.


  DO THIS PREP WORK, REGARDLESS OF YOUR SITUATION


  This is the time to examine your money situation and build savings, if possible. The fallout from the pandemic may continue for some time. Taking even small steps can help you feel empowered and less stressed.


  First, take stock of your regular expenses, such as housing costs, car loans and credit card or other debt payments. A budgeting worksheet can help account for everything and show what’s going to needs, wants and savings and debt. Once you see the big picture, consider trimming where you can because of the current uncertainty.


  “We’re all operating on a limited cognitive load right now,” says Kristen Holt, CEO of the nonprofit credit counseling agency GreenPath Financial Wellness. “Writing everything down and thinking it through first before you spend any of the money out the door would be a good idea.”

The DNA of businesses that are people first is just different, and yes, more resilient. Data from past recessions — including the great recession — show that employee-owned businesses outlast their competitors in business cycle downturns, and that they lay off fewer workers, and rehire them faster. In another part of the world, we see the example of Mondragon Corporation, a $13B cooperative business group in Spain’s Basque region. In 2013, during the Great Recession, their largest manufacturing company went bankrupt. Their response? Repurpose 2,000 employee-owners across their business group of 80,000. Employee-owners came together to take small pay cuts across the board among other strategies to avoid having to lay off big swaths of their employee- owners.

“When you combine them there is a suggestion that people have a less severe course of the disease,” he said. “One of the docs I know in North Carolina starts his patients on Azithromycin as soon as he has a suspicion that they could have the virus. Then he sends a sample to a central lab to be tested to see if the virus is there. If it is, then he adds Hydroxychloroquine to the existing Azithromycin prescription. He can essentially do anything he wants because the drugs are approved and off label use is at the discretion of the health care provider.”


  Doing tests that way can be risky, Andrews said, especially since both of those drugs are used widely, without any good data. Scientists in New York and China are currently studying this drug combination. Currently, Andrews said, scientists in China have 81 other active clinical trials for potential COVID-19 treatments.


  “Hopefully within a couple of weeks we’ll have a good handle on whether these two drugs are effective,” he said.


  But while scientists research treatments, Andrews said the only effective way to slow the spread of COVID-19 is by practicing social distancing and self- quarantine.


  “This is a short disease, if it doesn’t kill you,” he said. “It only lasts for 10 days with symptoms. The problem is you’re probably infectious for a longer period than that, and you don’t know. This disease is severe and extremely contagious. Right now self quarantine and social distancing are the most effective things we can do. They don’t involve drugs, so they’re as safe as you can be sitting in your living room watching television all day. Once we have a treatment that is effective, then we will be able to contain the disease in conjunction with social distancing practices.”


  But Andrews said social distancing may not last until a treatment or vaccine can be developed.


  “We don’t have to wait for a vaccine, which is fine because this epidemic is in full swing,” he said. “We don’t have to have a vaccine if we have a couple of good treatments, and these treatments can be developed within a couple of months.


  “If you listen to Trump, he’s itching to re-open the country by Easter,” Andrews said as he stressed the importance of science over politics. “That’s foolish. We don’t know when to open it up yet. We just don’t know how opening it now would not be a disaster. Trump seems to be the only one who wants to do it. He’s not listening like he should be to his medical counselors, so I’m a little concerned about what decision he’s going to make.”


  Andrews said he personally knows of three different companies in the U.S. that have scientists diligently working to develop treatments, but he expects there are many more.


  “This is pretty much low-hanging fruit because coronavirus hasn’t been around for awhile,” he said. “It’s such a fast disease and the FDA has streamlined their requirements so well that we can do the studies much quicker than before this epidemic. The hope is that we can mobilize the biotech industry into finding effective treatments for us.”

Therefore, to make medical systems more efficient, big IT companies like TCS can provide their technologically skills to upgrade systems. TCS is currently as of date the most valuable Indian company by way of market capitalisation at being valued at around Rs 6.82 lakh crore. It is a global IT services consulting and business solutions company partnering with the world’s leading businesses in their transforming journey. Digital adoption is progressing swiftly at a CAGR of around 40% during the last four years, wherein the ticket sizes are going up and early adopters are also taking up core transformation programmes. The TCS stock has always been a steady performer in the Indian stock markets where it has always hovered around the Rs 2,200 levels for most part of 2019. The recent pandemic onslaught has brought the indices to historic lows and leaving no exception, blue chip companies like TCS have also borne the brunt of seeing the stock touch Rs 1,500 levels. Since then, the TCS stock has recovered by 20% to touch the Rs 1,800 levels on the back of value buying by portfolio investors and mutual fund managers. There will definitely be many corrections in the stock market during the next few months with extreme bouts of volatility, but investors can accumulate the TCS stock in small quantities on a regular basis for long term portfolio gains. One cannot prevent market panics, but one can control the way to react. Dangers are lurking in the stock markets, but these slumps are a chance to buy good quality companies like TCS for building a superior portfolio.

In most respects, _Gamedec_ looks and plays like a traditional isometric RPG that takes players through a variety of environments ranging from a "deceitful farm-like environment, through dark-noir cyberpunk realities to fantasy-based realms." Here, however, rather than focus on combat, the game tasks players with using only their wits to "gather info from witnesses and suspects, get to the bottom of deceptive schemes, save lives, and investigate the extraordinary relationships between virtual worlds and their inhabitants." Roleplaying is nevertheless a core component, emulating the "nature of a tabletop RPG by focusing on multiple, choice-dependent, character-building scenarios." With numerous decisions to make and professional skills to upgrade, players are "given the freedom to approach situations from multiple angles rather than forcing a single solution - the choice is yours and yours alone." Of course, for every choice there is a consequence, which could be "immediate, long-term, or stay hidden, surfacing when least expected."

In many places, booze is also on the list of essentials. Britain at first kept liquor stores off its list of businesses allowed to remain open, but after reports of supermarkets running out of beer, wine and spirits, the government quickly added them.


  "Recent events clearly demonstrate that the process of designating 'essential services' is as much about culture as any legal-political reality about what is necessary to keep society functioning," said Christopher McKnight Nichols, associate professor of history at Oregon State University.


  Countries including India and U.S. states are listing the information technology sector as essential. The world's dependency on the internet has become even more apparent as countless people confined to their homes communicate, stream movies and play games online to stave off cabin fever.


  Several states where marijuana is legal, such as California and Washington, deemed pot shops and workers in the market's supply chain essential. The emphasis has been on the drug's medicinal uses, not enabling cooped-up people to get stoned.


  “Cannabis is a safe and effective treatment that millions of Americans rely on to maintain productive daily lives while suffering from diseases and ailments,” Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in an email. “It is the very definition of essential that these individuals can still access their medicine at this time.”

In many places, booze is also on the list of essentials. Britain at first kept liquor stores off its list of businesses allowed to remain open, but after reports of supermarkets running out of beer, wine and spirits, the government quickly added them.


  "Recent events clearly demonstrate that the process of designating 'essential services' is as much about culture as any legal-political reality about what is necessary to keep society functioning," said Christopher McKnight Nichols, associate professor of history at Oregon State University.


  Countries including India and U.S. states are listing the information technology sector as essential. The world's dependency on the internet has become even more apparent as countless people confined to their homes communicate, stream movies and play games online to stave off cabin fever.


  Several states where marijuana is legal, such as California and Washington, deemed pot shops and workers in the market's supply chain essential. The emphasis has been on the drug's medicinal uses, not enabling cooped-up people to get stoned.


  “Cannabis is a safe and effective treatment that millions of Americans rely on to maintain productive daily lives while suffering from diseases and ailments,” Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in an email. “It is the very definition of essential that these individuals can still access their medicine at this time.”


  Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont added gun shops to his list of essential businesses, generating shock and dismay among families of gun violence victims. His spokesman Max Reiss said Lamont is trying not to overly disrupt commerce or interfere with legal rights.

Further, this data gives us the context to see whether, in fact, we are _flattening the curve_ for the virus. What that phrase really means is slowing the infection rate. We can see that, in the U.S., we have made real progress. Of course, we still have a long way to go, especially compared with other countries that have been hit hard. We are now at the lower end of the spread rate seen this month, despite the increased testing that has likely pushed up the growth in recognized new cases. Based on other countries, we likely will continue to see the spread rate drop as social distancing becomes more widespread over a longer time period. We are making progress, and the chart above shows that.

From an article written by Jason Zweig that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 19, 2020. “Stress is going to make investors less of who they are, an impoverished version of themselves. It causes you to fall back on simpler methods of approaching your world. You have a decreased ability to use your previous experiences and knowledge to make smart choices in new settings.” Peter Sokol-Hessner (cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Denver).


  Of course you are worried. We can help to alleviate this worry by noting that since 1950, the stock market has always been higher three years after a bear market of this magnitude. Moreover, we are working hard to identify those sectors as well as the companies within those sectors that we believe will emerge stronger after this crisis is over.


  We are working diligently to reposition assets, where appropriate, into these sectors. It will be a changed world. All crises create economic opportunity. This will be no different.


  That said, at this time the duration of this healthcare crisis along with the uncertainty is unknown. We anticipate the following to occur. The number of potentially infected Americans will increase exponentially as the virus works its way through our communities and as the number of individuals being tested increases exponentially. This should occur over the next two weeks. As this occurs, the curve that represents the number infected will swell and then hopefully flatten.


  That is to say that the increase in the pace of the number of cases identified will slow. That will most likely also occur within the next one to four weeks. Along, the way epidemiologist will be accumulating statistically meaningful data pertaining to the number tested as compared to the number infected. In addition, they will then begin to develop the ratio between the number of fatalities as compared to those infected.


  Fourth, those going to work in the public domain must be tested to make certain that they are not infected. Finally, we can all hope and pray for a speedy medical solution – an antidote and vaccine. We believe stocks will begin to recover as progress is made along this timeline.


  Looking forward, expect more volatility. Perhaps there will be many bounces and false starts prior to a true recovery. Regardless, when the bottom comes it will be powerful and lasting. We also believe it may ultimately bring with it a rapid period of economic growth and innovation.
