JOHANNESBURG - While the European League is now planning a way forward, there is still no clarity on what the next step is for local South African football.


  The Premier Soccer League (PSL) has been suspended since 16 March with no indication when it will resume, but the board of governors has said they hope to resume the 2019/20 season by June.


  Cape Town City chairman, John Comitis, admitted there will be serious implications if the current season doesn’t end.


  “You cannot expect the clubs that are at the bottom of the Absa Premiership to just accept relegation and the ones that are top of the NFD (Glad Africa Championship) to say, ‘well we’ll just go again next year’ when there are five, six games left,” he said. It will be completely unreasonable. At the same time, you can expect a legal case for damages and losses”.


  As a result of the continued postponement, governing bodies and athletes have been forced to take salary cuts.


  The South African Football Association’s (SAFA) top brass has taken a voluntary 15% cut in a bid to support the fight against the spread of Covid-19.


  But for Cape Town City, Comitis said, for the time being, players and staff will be continued to be paid in full.


  “When you cut salaries, it will still be a lot of money, whether you take 20% or 30%, it’s still a lot of money by normal standards. Everyone has their own commitments. At this stage, we are focused on ensuring we can put food on people’s plates”.


  Comitis also spoke about the financial implications of having the sport postponed. This comes amid rumours that AmaZulu is the first Absa Premiership club to ask players to take pay cuts.


  “We rely on certain revenues that come to the club on the fact that you are active on TV and are able to give exposure to sponsors and that. You don’t know at what point they will pull the plug. In order to survive, you need to take precautions and put scenarios in place”.

And remote learning requires a great degree of self-discipline. Keeping kids off their cellphones is a challenge in and of itself.
 Left to their own devices, well, self-discipline is more fantasy than reality.
 Don’t get me wrong.
 The technology available for remote learning is a fantasy that became reality, and many students have the self-discipline to learn and grow by using it.
 However, for the majority of students, I really don’t think it is a realistic option for any significant degree of remote learning and never will be.
 There simply is no substitute for a class and a teacher, in one room, focused.
 That direct contact, the human to human interaction, is priceless and can never be duplicated on a computer screen.
 In fact, studies are already showing that a reliance on social media has a detrimental impact on learning, from being a distraction to the use of proper language and grammar.
 Everything is short-circuited, tending to lower the tolerance for delayed gratification and minimizing the rewards of the intrinsic value of learning and working toward a goal.
 I know educators are touting the plan in place for remote learning during the pandemic and teachers are doing their best to make it work.
 But my guess is that, for most students, these last two-and-a-half months of this school year will not bring anywhere close to the results that in-class teaching does.
 I was a pretty good student and well-behaved and really wanted to learn.
 If I would have had to rely on my own motivation and focus to learn remotely, though, I just can’t see it happening. I would have learned some, but not even in the ballpark of what I would have learned in a classroom.
 Besides, my poor mother would have been hoarse quickly and without a voice to yell at me, well, I don’t even want to think about what would have happened.
 Nervous breakdown comes to mind.

ANSA) - ROMA, 27 APR - Il Fondo da 100 milioni di euro per il sostegno alle societa sportive "avra piena attuazione questa settimana, compatibilmente con la pubblicazione del decreto che stabilira i criteri per l'accesso, con un regolamento trasparente, una offerta che e una novita per quel che ci riguarda, visto che finora in oltre 60 anni di storia abbiamo finanziato l'80% degli impianti sportivi in Italia ma mai ci eravamo cimentati con il tema della liquidita". Cosi il presidente dell'Istituto per il credito sportivo Andrea Abodi riferendo in un'audizione informale alle Commissioni riunite della Camera dei Deputati in merito all'esame del disegno di legge del decreto n. 23 del 2020, recante, tra le altre, misure urgenti in materia di accesso al credito e di adempimenti fiscali. "Da quando e stata approvata la norma, l'8 aprile scorso - specifica Abodi - abbiano costituito una sorta di banca parallela", grazie all'attivazione di una struttura che opera "con grande abnegazione e senso del dovere" e che, ha sottolineato il presidente dell'Ics, "non era predisposta neanche sotto il profilo tecnologico". Il Fondo sara destinato "a circa 100mila unita, sapendo che potra coprire solo una parte delle esigenze ma e importante che si sia aperto un canale per il sostegno di queste realta". Il tetto per ciascuna assegnazione e stato fissato in "25mila euro, parametrata al 25% del fatturato del 2019, con un finanziamento a tasso zero e senza garanzia". (ANSA).

Ziggler has, however, been labeled by many fans as someone who was never consistently pushed at the level that crowd reaction indicated he should be.

Time after time, I have heard people say, “This is the hardest thing we have ever gone through. But we will be all right because God is with us as never before.” Time and time again I have heard hurting people make that powerful statement: “God is with us as never before.”
 God is always with us in every circumstance of life. But God is uniquely and especially with us when we are hurting, and I think I know two reasons why. First, I think it’s because we are more open to the presence of God when we are down and out. The only way we can trust up is if we have gone down.
 Second, love enables us to see ourselves differently – not as failures or full of fear – but as created from God’s love, filled with God’s love, always moving toward God’s love. The best way to freely give God’s love out to others is if we have first gone inward to receive it.

Coronovirus self-isolation has forced Nigel Osner to get creative with his new podcast for the over 60s.


  The Hampstead Garden Suburb lyricist and performer had originally named it after his latest Edinburgh Fringe show; Too Young To Stay In Too Old To Go Out!


  But just a week later he was confined indoors and decided to change it to a line from one of his comic songs ‘Too Bored to Stay In Too Scared To Go Out’.


  He has even taken to interviewing one of his characters, a prissy spinster named Doreen.


  He explains: “When I came back from the Edinburgh Fringe last year - and had recovered from a toe broken on the suitcase containing my costumes – I decided to develop a podcast aimed at the 60 plus demographic about the problems and opportunities for those no longer young.


  “It looks at some of the challenges that listeners may be facing in their Platinum years but in particular I want to celebrate those who defy the stale expectations of what being older means in largely good humoured discussions.


  “I talk to people and discuss their philosophy of ageing well. Hopefully it will bring a smile to my listeners who will probably relate to the challenges that we are all facing.”


  His debut podcast, recorded just before the lockdown, was a conversation with Carole Stone about friendship and love. Known as the Networking Queen, the former Woman’s Hour and Any Questions producer has set up The Carole Stone Foundation to promote connecting people, exchanging ideas and building global friendships as essential to a fairer society.


  “I recorded my conversation with Carole in a studio but almost immediately I was faced with lockdown, which is particularly restrictive for me as I am over 70,” he adds.


  “In the second podcast I reviewed my current position with Covid and lockdown and rewrote the title song of the show and the podcast.


  “Then I interviewed one of my cabaret characters, who is stuck on a cruise ship outside Sorrento because everyone on board is in quarantine. She is sharing a cabin with a friend she now hates!”


  Osner recorded his schizophrenic conversation on his phone and says the audience response has been very positive.


  “For the next episodes, I will be upping my technological game by setting up a home studio and conducting virtual interviews. Next on my list will be speaking to Maggie Pigott, who has written a book called ‘How to age joyfully.”

This is why it is more important than ever to think outside the box and innovate through collaboration. It is only through thoughtful conversation, trial and error, and varied perspectives that companies will be able to make deliberate decisions that will ensure current and future success for the company.

  “I would like to clarify that at the local level, we are not able to “relax” the Governor’s directives or grant waivers to certain businesses or types of businesses. Local Public Health Officers can only issue local orders that mirror or are more restrictive than the Governor’s Directives,” said Trisha Gardner, Health Officer


  Gardner issued a local health order that mirrors the governor’s message and is still encouraging people to practice good hygiene, social distancing, and disinfecting surfaces using masks and practicing thorough hand washing.

Bill Miller, president of the Monroe County Commission, said he has received the same letter Cabell County did and is just as confused as everyone else.
 The money has yet to be spent for anything as the commission is waiting on clarification.
 “It looks like it just has be for overtime and other expenses,” he said. “I want to make sure we do the right thing with the money.”
 Miller said the county is glad to have it and would like to use some of if for hero pay, but at this point he is not sure if the county can actually spend it on that.
 “I am not going to do the wrong thing,” he said, adding that the letter seems to indicate strict guidelines.
 Justice said spending the money has some “constraints to consider,” but the leaders at the county level should make the decisions on getting the money to the people “who have been looking out for us in every way…”
 But the question remains if counties can disperse the money as a “reward” or just on related expenses.
 In the meantime, the money will remain in the account, Puckett said.
 “We have until December 30 to spend it,” he added.
