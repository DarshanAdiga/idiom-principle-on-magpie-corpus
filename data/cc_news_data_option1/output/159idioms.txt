Charl Schwartzel … Ended a seven-month break due to a sore wrist with a T3 at the Alfred Dunhill Championship on Dec. 1. Equipped with 12 starts on a Major Medical Extension. That may not seem like a significant allotment, but he made just 18-20 starts in each of his previous six seasons. Because he's healthy again, not to mention rested, you have a green light.

China hawks ate up the story and pointed to it as an example of US companies seeking profits over country. AMD denied the allegations and stated it had complied with US regulations, while industry insiders concluded sensitive technology probably did not change hands. In the meantime, Commerce banned AMD from licensing the technology to its Chinese partner. Irrespective of the report’s accuracy, the AMD debacle left a sour taste in Washington, and US companies are likely to face more hawkish sentiment in the media and deeper investigative reporting.

Modernising our power infrastructure will go a long way towards reducing our dependence on non-renewables and helping South-east Asia meet tomorrow's power needs today. However, in order to build a strong foundation for the next chapter, companies must first commit to a thorough assessment of their electrification strategy and invest in the right technologies and partnerships to kickstart this long-term process. After all, it will be essential for businesses to be hyper aware of their impact on the environment and the societies they operate in, as customers increasingly place emphasis on shared values and accountability - whether it is carbon-free cloud services or cleaner everyday utilities. And with much of this technology already commercially viable today, there's no reason not to start in 2020.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Marijuana legalization looked like it was on a roll in the Northeast a year ago. It had already passed in three of the region's states and was a priority for governors in three more, including populous New York. Then legislative efforts stalled, and a vaping sickness stirred new concerns. But the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut still want to make recreational pot legal, and they and Pennsylvania's governor have been comparing notes on how to do it. The states have different approaches and political appetites. And they're facing new questions as both opponents and advocates of legalization point to the vaping scare to make their cases.

It doesn't hurt that he answered his second victory (at the Safeway Open) with four cuts made in five starts worldwide, including a T8 at the Dunlop Phoenix.

"Frozen 2" - produced by Quincy native Peter Del Vecho - got an icy reception when the nominations for the 92nd Academy Awards were announced Monday.
 The blockbuster sequel, the highest-grossing animated film ever, failed to make the cut. It is, however, up for original song, "Into the Unknown." "Frozen 2" added another $5.8 million to its haul this past weekend for a total of $459.4 million, placing it 8th in its eighth week of release. The movie earned recognition from critics groups and nominations from the Producers Guild, Golden Globes and the British Academy Film and Television Arts awards.
 In 2014, Del Vecho took home the Oscar for "Frozen," which also won for original song, the ubiquitous "Let It Go." He is a 1976 graduate of Quincy High School. He also produced the Oscar-nominated "The Princess and the Frog" (2009) and "Winnie the Pooh" (2011).
 No local talent received nominations this year, but there are Massachusetts connections to the 2020 Oscars.
 "Little Women," Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's tale of four sisters growing up in Massachusetts during the Civil War, received six nominations, including best picture. Scenes were shot in and around Boston, including at Fruitlands Museum in Harvard, the Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate in Canton, the Crane Estate in Ipswich and the Old Manse in Concord. Kingston actor Chris Cooper, an Oscar-winner for "Adaptation," and Milton actor Tom Kemp co-star in the film. Many locals appear as extras, including Hingham's Jaclyn Sanford, who was cast in a dance scene.
 The famed Ames Mansion at the 1,700-acre Borderland State Park has a starring role in Rian Johnson's comedic murder-mystery "Knives Out," which received an original-screenplay nod.
 A nomination also went to the documentary "For Sama," produced by WGBH's "Frontline" in Boston. It chronicles a husband-and-wife team operating a makeshift hospital in Aleppo during the Russian bombings of the Syrian city during 2016.
 Robert Richardson, a three-time Oscar-winning cinematographer from Hyannis, is up for his work on Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood."
 Worcester native Scott Silver's "Joker" script was nominated for best-adapted screenplay. He won the original screenplay award in 2011 for "The Fighter."
 Cambridge native Matt Damon, plays race-team leader Carroll Shelby in James Mangold's high-octane "Ford v Ferrari," nominated for four Oscars, including best picture.
 The live-action short "Saria," from Sudbury director Brian Buckley, landed a nomination. It tells the story of two orphan sisters seeking refuge in the United States.
 Winners will be announced beginning at 8 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 9, on ABC.

"A garden that feeds us year round must be fed," the course description says. "This workshop will teach us how to improve soil, increase and maintain fertility, and support soil life for the long term success of your garden. Adding mulch and compost to your garden is a simple way to start, but in the long run, to maintain soil health you will need to increase organic matter and mineral availability. As plants grow, they absorb nutrients in order to produce delicious food for us to eat. Plant growth and development largely depends on the nutrients available in the soil and a deficiency can lead to less healthy plants and therefore, less healthy food. Join us to explore the value of soil care, how to feed your garden with natural nutrients and increase the number of organisms that live in the soil."
