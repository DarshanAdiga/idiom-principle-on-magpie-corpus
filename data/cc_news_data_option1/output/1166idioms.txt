Dan did the right thing by calling to confirm he had met the spending requirement. Bank of America deserves some of the blame because its representatives provided bad information, but unfortunately, that's bound to happen sometimes. To insulate yourself from miscalculations (regardless of who is at fault), I recommend you surpass the spending requirement by a comfortable margin instead of trying to hit it on the nose. The amount you should overspend depends on the card and how you use it, as well as the terms of your bonus offer, but I'd aim for at least a few hundred dollars of breathing room. You should also cross the threshold with time to spare, so you can be confident all your charges will settle before the deadline.

In Seattle, the initial epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, Food Lifeline is struggling. It relies on roughly 18,000 volunteers every year to collect and sort food donations, package boxes and deliver goods. The organization is now telling all but a small core group of volunteers to stay home.
 “We can’t take those food donations because we can’t sort and repack them,” Mark Coleman said. Instead, they’re buying prepackaged food that doesn’t require sorting, at roughly $30 per box. All of this is happening as they expect demand for their services to double, Coleman said. Before the crisis, they packaged 72,000 boxes a month.
 “It’s really tough. The stock market crash in 2008 was tough, but nothing like this,” he said.
 Joe Burns, 69, is among just 20 volunteers still pitching in at Food Lifeline. For the past four years, he’s come four days a week to sort apples, oranges and other fresh fruits and vegetables. That won’t change, he said.
 “People are getting laid off left and right and going on unemployment and very soon aren’t going to have any means for buying groceries,” he said. “There’s a need right now so you just gotta step up to the plate.”
 It’s not just food banks whose volunteer workforce has dwindled.

Among the first to test the new political world will be two rivals for an open seat in a narrowly divided House district in Los Angeles’ northern suburbs.
 Republican Mike Garcia and Democrat Christy Smith face a special election in May, when voters seem certain to still be focused on the virus and the battered economy. As elsewhere, efforts to curb the infection’s spread means campaign phone calls and digital communications are replacing public events.
 Both concede it’s hard to get people’s attention, but each said they are already sharpening their appeals to voters.
 During tough times, people “remember what the important things are, and that’s God, country and family,” Garcia, a Trump supporter and former Navy fighter pilot, said in an interview. “We’re all on the same team.”
 “Patriotism alone doesn’t set food on people’s tables,” said Smith, a state assemblywoman. She said that Trump’s virus response has put the U.S. “woefully behind” the infection and that it’s time for “a reckoning on what effective government looks like.”
 Both parties say it’s too early to know if the virus will be contained and the economy resuscitated by the time voters focus on the fall campaigns — and whether they’ll blame or laud Trump and the GOP for the outcome.
 Either way, Trump is casting himself as a wartime president in hopes of garnering the broad public support that usually goes to national leaders in times of crisis.
 His reelection campaign has been using the emergencies in fundraising appeals that offer supporters autographed “Keep America Great” hats. “Our country is facing unprecedented times right now and President Trump is working around the clock to keep our Nation and its citizens safe,” his emails say.

Folks were just plain thrilled to get their hands on toilet paper.
 “Customers knew we were expecting a delivery at 9 (a.m.) and they were already lined up at the door by 7:30 this morning,” said store manager Jane Brant. “So, toilet paper is our big draw today. People are absolutely ecstatic.”
 Three Arizona Rangers were on hand to assist with crowd control, just in case things got a little crazy.
 “Because of the shortages that stores are going through right now, we’re here to help with the crowd and see that everything runs smoothly,” said Ranger James Howe, who was stationed at the front door where he greeted customers with a cheerful, “Are you here for toilet paper?”
 All toilet paper-seekers were directed to a line at one side of the store, where customers pulled packs out of cardboard boxes and loaded them into their grocery carts.
 No need to stock shelves. The supply of paper towels and toilet paper was gone within three hours from the time it was delivered.
 Ranger Al Hirsch was in the back of the store, where deliveries are dropped off, helping employee Becky Cougot open boxes and shove them out to the line of customers.
 “I’ve been working here for four months and have never seen anything like this at our store,” Cougot said. “When you think about how worried everyone is about getting supplies, our customers have been considerate and respectful through this.”
 RVers Sandra and Paul Saunders stopped by the store for a few items before heading down the road toward their home in Colorado.
 “We haven’t been able to find toilet paper or paper towels anywhere and that includes the big box stores, so we’re pleasantly surprised,” Sandra Saunders said. “We were a bit taken aback to see Arizona Rangers here when we first walked in, but everyone was great. I’ve never seen people so giddy over toilet paper before.”
 Like most of the people at Dollar General that morning, Huachuca City resident Julie Star and her 6-year-old grandson, Jacob Swick, toilet paper was the main attraction.
 “I’m here to buy paper products for my disabled neighbor and my own family, so I’m beyond thrilled about the toilet paper,” Star laughed. “We’ve had a very hard time finding certain items because of this health crisis. I think we all need to take a deep breath and just use our heads through this,” she added. “God will take care of us and we’ll get through this.”
 Within three hours after the delivery, Dollar General had sold out of its paper products.
 “I think this buying panic is going to settle down once people realize there’s no need to hoard supplies,” Dollar General customer Eric Patterson said. “My understanding is that these supplies are not in short supply, but the hoarding has created a disruption in the supply chain, which then accounts for the shortages we’re seeing. Hoarding is a big problem right now.”

With masks, ventilators and political goodwill in desperately short supply, more than one-fifth of the world's population was ordered or urged to stay in their homes on Monday at the start of what could be a pivotal week in the battle to contain the coronavirus in the US and Europe.
 Partisan divisions stalled efforts to pass a colossal aid package in Congress, and stocks fell again on Wall Street even after the Federal Reserve said it will lend to small and large businesses and local governments to help them through the crisis.
 Britain became the latest European country to order a near lockdown, imposing its most draconian peacetime restrictions in one of the world's largest economies.
 It came the same day the head of the World Health Organization warned that the outbreak was accelerating and called on countries to take strong, coordinated action.
 "We are not helpless bystanders," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, noting that it took 67 days to reach 100,000 cases worldwide but just four days to go from 200,000 to 300,000. "We can change the trajectory of this pandemic."
 The scramble to marshal public health and political resources intensified in New York, where a statewide lockdown took effect amid worries the city of 8.4 million is becoming one of the world's biggest hot spots. More than 12,000 people have tested positive in the city and almost 100 have died.
 The governor announced plans to convert a mammoth New York City convention center into a hospital with 1,000 beds. The mayor warned that the city's hospitals are just 10 days away from shortages in basic supplies.
 "This is going to get much worse before it gets better. We are still in the relative calm before the storm," Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.
 In Italy, the hardest-hit country, declines in both new cases and deaths for a second consecutive day provided a faint glimmer of hope, though it is too soon to say whether the crisis is leveling off.
 Italian officials said Monday that the virus had claimed just over 600 more lives, down from 793 two days earlier. All told, the outbreak has killed more than 6,000 Italians, the highest death toll of any country, and pushed the health system to the breaking point there and in Spain.
 The risk to doctors, nurses and others on the front lines has become plain: Italy has seen at least 18 doctors with coronavirus die. Spain reported that more than 3,900 health care workers have become infected, accounting for roughly 12 percent of the country's total cases.
 British health workers pleaded for more gear, saying they felt like "cannon fodder." In France, doctors scrounged masks from construction workers, factory floors, an architect.
 "There's a wild race to get surgical masks," François Blanchecott, a biologist on the front lines of testing, told France Inter radio. "We're asking mayors' offices, industries, any enterprises that might have a store of masks."
 The way US officials respond to the severe pressure on hospitals -- and people's willingness to keep their distance from others -- will prove critical in coming days, public health experts said.
 "Actions taken right now will have a huge impact on the course of this epidemic in the US," said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington. "It's an important moment."
 In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the virus the "biggest threat this country has faced for decades" as he ordered people to stay home and directed shops that don't sell essential goods to shut down. He warned that police would be authorized to break up public gatherings of more than two people. Johnson faced pressure to roll out tougher measures because many have ignored advice on social distancing.
 In the US, President Donald Trump told reporters he believes the American economy, which has been virtually shut down, could be reopened in weeks, not months. Trump wouldn't say when businesses would be up and running but that he wasn't "looking at months, I can tell you right now. We're going to be opening up the country."
 Amid complaints of hospitals running low on masks, gloves and other critical gear, Trump signed an executive order making it a crime to stockpile supplies needed by medical workers. Attorney General William Barr said investigators will go after those hoarding goods on "an industrial scale" and price gouging.
 "If you are sitting on a warehouse with surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door," Barr told reporters.
 China is now sending planeloads of protective gear and doctors to Europe as the crisis kept easing in the country where the virus first emerged late last year. For more than a week, the vast majority of China's cases have been in people coming into the country rather than from community spread, according to the National Health Commission.
 "The US is completely wasting the precious time that China has won for the world," said Geng Shuang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US government's top infectious-disease expert, promised that medical supplies are about to start pouring in and will be "clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most."
 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticized Trump for not using the full force of federal authority to combat the virus.
 "Trump keeps saying he's a wartime president," Biden said in an online address. "Well, start acting like one."
 On Capitol Hill, a nearly $2 trillion plan that would prop up businesses and send checks to American households has stalled. Democrats argued it was tilted toward corporations rather than workers and health care providers.
 Meanwhile, industries big and small kept shutting down. Boeing announced it was suspending production in the Seattle area, where it has two mammoth aircraft plants employing about 42,000 people.
 More than 378,000 people worldwide have been infected and over 16,500 have died from the virus, according to a running tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. More than 1.5 billion people around the globe have been instructed to stay in their homes.
 After just a few weeks, the US has nearly 44,000 cases and more than 500 deaths. Indiana, Michigan, Washington state and West Virginia joined states including California, Illinois and New York in asking or ordering residents to stay home and keep businesses closed -- directives that cover more than one- third of the U.S. population in a patchwork of rules imposed by governors or cities.
 Louisiana's governor urged residents to comply with his stay-at-home order, with New Orleans officials even removing basketball hoops from playgrounds and parks because people were still playing.
 "The virus is here, and everybody needs to act as if they already have it," Gov. John Bel Edwards said.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. But for some older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Over 100,000 people have recovered, mostly in China.
 Former Hollywood studio boss Harvey Weinstein tested positive at the prison in New York where he is serving a 23-year sentence for rape and sexual assault, the head of the guards union said.
 Authorities kept up their push to get people to stay home, but some were not listening. Social media showed snapshots of packed London Underground trains.
 In New York, Cuomo fumed over gatherings of young people, saying, "It's reckless and it's violative of your civic spirit and duty as a citizen, as far as I'm concerned."
 In a city where many people live in buildings with small elevators, a 21-story high-rise in the Chelsea neighborhood posted a notice in the lobby warning that there should be just one person per elevator, and those going to the laundry room shouldn't use a washing machine next to another one in use.
 "People are really only going to get food and going back. That's what we need," said Matt Comet, making a brief dash into the nearly empty streets of his Manhattan neighborhood to pick up a carryout meal.
 "I'm OK to have a book and watch TV for a bit, but if it continues for another month, another two months, it'll be pretty crazy," he said.
 Closures upended life worldwide.
 India took the extraordinary step of shutting down the nation's vast rail system, the lifeblood of the country of 1.3 billion people.
 Nepal has ordered a weeklong lockdown, while Myanmar reported its first two cases of the virus.
 UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate cease-fire in conflicts around the world to tackle the pandemic.
 "It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives," he said.

First things first: Let's talk about Capital One Venture's 50,000-mile sign-up bonus. At the end of the day, miles are a type of currency, just like points. You can use them to book plane tickets — that's something we like to call an "award redemption." In other words, you're redeeming your miles for award space, also known as a seat on a plane that's available to book using points or miles. While travel isn't possible at the moment, things will go back to normal eventually and you'll be well prepared with the miles from this card and the knowledge to redeem them effectively.

Eleven of the 35 occupants of Kalpana Tower where Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor stayed with her uncle on March 13, have tested negative for coronavirus. The reports of 24 persons are awaited.
 Kanika had visited Kalpana Tower to attend the house-warming party of her maternal uncle Vipul Tandon's flat no 902 in the building. District magistrate Brahma Deo Ram Tiwari said, "As many as 56 people had attended the 'grah pravesh' function hosted by Vipul Tandon on March 13.
 Chief Medical Officer Ashok Shukla said 35 samples were collected on Friday and Saturday and the test results of 11 came on Monday. "Eleven people of the family including Vipul Tandon, Radhika Tandon, Meena Tandon, Mukul Kumar Tandon, Nandini Tandon, Yash Tandon, Manvi Tandon, Khyati Tandon, Subhash Mehrotra, Ruchi Mehrotra and Sonal Mehrotra have tested negative and the reports of 24 others are awaited," he said.
 The building has now been sanitized even as number of occupants have moved out for the time being.
 Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor tested positive again in a second test for coronavirus on Monday. The singer's sample was tested again at the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences here after her family members raised questions about the initial test reports. Kanika is reported to be stable as of now.
 The police are tracing all those who came in contact with her in the last few days. Reportedly, 160 persons came in her contact in three parties after she returned from the UK.
 Earlier, the Lucknow police booked Kanika on charges of negligence for attending various social events in the city last week despite being infected with coronavirus and having been instructed by the authorities to isolate herself at her home.
