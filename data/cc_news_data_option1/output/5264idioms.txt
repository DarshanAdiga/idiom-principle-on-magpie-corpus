The coronavirus pandemic is dragging down U.S. consumer confidence during the crucial holiday season, which could make or break a number of retailers, airlines, restaurants and other sectors. The December reading of 88.6 released Tuesday by the Conference Board is a sharp decline from last month, which was revised downward to 92.9, and it is far worse than economists had expected.

At the center of the debacle was a rules-based formula designed to determine the order in which the thousands of medical workers at Stanford should be vaccinated. The tool took into account employee-based variables like age, job- based variables, and public health guidance, according to MIT Technology Review. But flaws in that calculation meant hospital administrators and other employees working from home were toward the front of the line, while only seven of Stanford’s 1,300 medical residents made the list.

Generally require out-of-network service providers to give patients 72-hour notice of their estimated charges. Patients would have to agree to receive out-of-network care for the hospital or doctor to then bill them.
 — Bar air ambulance services from sending patients surprise bills for more than the in-network cost sharing amount. Air ambulance charges have become a bigger problem in states where patients have to travel long distances to get to the best hospitals. However, ground ambulance services will not face the same restrictions, and the legislation only calls for more study of their billing practices.
 The compromise legislation involved two years of work from dozens of lawmakers of both parties and key committees, including Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means in the House, and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions in the Senate.
 Surprise bills hit patients and their families when they are most vulnerable — after a medical emergency or following a complex surgical procedure. Often patients are able to negotiate lower charges by working with their insurers and the medical provider. But the process usually takes months, adding stress and anxiety. Sometimes it doesn't work out and the bills are sent to collection agencies.
 "Our constituents have done everything right at the doctor's office or hospital yet still found themselves stuck with surprise medical bills, sometimes to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars," said Sens. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Bill Cassidy, R-La. "And frequently, they have to fight these bills at the same time they are facing a medical crisis."
 According to the Kaiser Foundation, 18% of emergency visits lead to at least one out-of-network charge for people covered by large employers, as do 16% of in-network inpatient admissions. New York and Texas have among the highest rates.
 The problem is a direct of result of high health care costs. To try to keep premiums in check, insurers set up networks of hospitals and doctors who agree in advance on payment levels. But some high-demand clinicians, such as emergency room doctors and anesthesiologists, have an incentive to stay out of at least some networks, trying to maximize their earning power. That dynamic has grown more complicated as profit-seeking investors buy out medical practices that have greater billing leverage.
 Insurers were cool to the compromise, saying the structure of the dispute resolution process could lead to higher payouts that then feed premium increases. Some Democrats had advocated using a predetermined price list to resolve billing disputes, but that struck Republicans and other Democrats as too close to government rate setting.
 "Our for-profit health care system really allows companies to make money in the different gaps of the system," said Kemp, the health care advocate from Public Citizen. "This is a hopeful day. I thought between the insurers and the providers, there wasn't going to be surprise billing legislation passed."
 Public programs like Medicare and Medicaid prohibit or restrict such billing practices.

When it comes to setting boundaries for yourself at the holidays, MSK psychiatrist Monique James, MD, had some advice about how best to navigate an often demanding time of year. "We all have limited energy and that is true whether you're going through cancer treatment or not, however of course, going through cancer treatment and recovery, our energies are even more limited. So, it is going to be important to prioritize them," she shared.  "Setting boundaries is really being honest with ourselves to know our own limits. I often encourage prioritizing your energies to take stock of the things during the holidays that you really enjoy.  What is it that you want to place your energies in, because you first have to have this kind-of internal dialogue before you give them to your loved ones. So, be honest with yourself, listen to your body."

It added Brussels now appeared willing to accept a reduction in the value of its catch in UK waters of up to 25% over a period of time from 2021.
 Downing Street is not denying the phone call between Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen took place but pointed to commitments made previously that they would stay in touch during negotiations.
 In mid-December, both sides were loudly talking up the prospect of no-deal.
 But after yet more deadlines passed that they said were the points a deal needed to be reached by, public statements from Number 10 and the Berlaymont (the European Commission headquarters) have gone much quieter.
 More speculation a deal could be clinched was boosted by a former Number 10 special adviser on Brexit, who wrote an article for Politico laying out how a compromise could be reached on fish in time.
 There is just over a week to go until the end of the transition period - the arrangement the UK entered into once it left the EU on 31 January.
 Since then, the country has continued to follow most of the bloc's rules while negotiators try to hammer out an agreement.
 Talks appear to be going down to the wire, and with parliament broken up for the Christmas holidays, Sky News has been told it could be recalled on 30 December to approve any last-minute agreement.

Bridges to Independence, a Northern Virginia provider of housing and vital services for at-risk families and individuals, has finalized its merger with the Bonder and Amanda Johnson Community Development Corp., a community-based non-profit with a mission to address the health, education, financial empowerment and social service needs of people living in Arlington’s Green Valley neighborhood.
 “We are excited about moving forward with a strong, unified organization that will ensure people in Green Valley and throughout Northern Virginia receive the support and services they need,” said Bridges’ board president Patrick King. “As our communities and families continue to struggle with the impact of COVID-19, the work of Bridges to Independence and BAJCDC is more important than ever.”
 The two organizations will unify under Bridges to Independence to provide youth education, social service referrals, health and wellness guidance, and financial education – adding to Bridges’ current housing, employment and youth development portfolio.
 Bridges will also maintain operations at BAJCDC’s Green Valley location on South Shirlington Road. Former BAJCDC Executive Director Cecily Whitfield also serves as Bridges’ chief program officer while maintaining her position on the executive committee of the Green Valley Civic Association board.
 Whitfield said, “This merger will bring opportunities to truly support the Green Valley community through programs and resources that can act as a change agent and provide impactful service delivery to the community.”
 The merger was celebrated with a virtual ceremony on Dec. 19.

Still, the package was an extraordinary response to the global pandemic — the second major bill this year — and was negotiated almost entirely behind closed doors by congressional leadership.

The bill combines coronavirus-fighting funds with financial relief for individuals and businesses. It would establish a temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefit and a $600 direct stimulus payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants, and theaters and money for schools, health care providers and renters facing eviction.
 The 5,593-page legislation — by far the longest bill ever — came together Sunday after months of battling, posturing and postelection negotiating that reined in a number of Democratic demands as the end of the congressional session approached. Biden was eager for a deal to deliver long-awaited help to suffering people and a boost to the economy, even though it was less than half the size that Democrats wanted in the fall.
 "This deal is not everything I want — not by a long shot," said Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., a longstanding voice in the party's old-school liberal wing. "The choice before us is simple. It's about whether we help families or not. It's about whether we help small businesses and restaurants or not. It's about whether we boost (food stamp) benefits and strengthen anti-hunger programs or not. And whether we help those dealing with a job loss or not. To me, this is not a tough call."
 The Senate, meanwhile, was also on track to pass a one-week stopgap spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown at midnight and give Trump time to sign the sweeping legislation.
 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a key negotiator, said on CNBC Monday morning that the direct payments would begin arriving in bank accounts next week.
 Democrats promised more aid to come once Biden takes office, but Republicans were signaling a wait-and-see approach.
 The measure would fund the government through September, wrapping a year's worth of action on annual spending bills into a single package that never saw Senate committee or floor debate.
 The legislation followed a tortured path. Democrats played hardball up until Election Day, amid accusations that they wanted to deny Trump a victory that might help him prevail. Democrats denied that, but their demands indeed became more realistic after Trump's loss and as Biden made it clear that half a loaf was better than none.
 The final bill bore ample resemblance to a $1 trillion package put together by Senate Republican leaders in July, a proposal that at the time was scoffed at by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as way too little.
 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took a victory lap after blocking far more ambitious legislation from reaching the Senate floor. He said the pragmatic approach of Biden was key.
 "The president-elect suggesting that we needed to do something now was helpful in moving both Pelosi and Schumer into a better place," McConnell told The Associated Press. "My view about what comes next is let's take a look at it. Happy to evaluate that based upon the needs that we confront in February and March."

Normally I wouldn’t find her plight so enthralling, but on this viewing, as soon as her husband and kids left for the day, I desperately wanted to know what this woman did with her alone time. She wasn’t juggling home school and work during a global crisis, so did she just keep on cleaning? Maybe she mixed herself a clandestine Tom Collins and took a bubble bath. Where were the scenes of her celebrating her freedom by dancing through an empty house, like Jill Clayburgh in “An Unmarried Woman”? Was I projecting?
 Something tells me she was not sipping cocktails and pirouetting from room to room.
 Instead, we see Mother serving up cabbage and meatloaf, which practically makes her a saint in my book. I’ve occasionally handed my toddler son Goldfish and some grapes for dinner over the past year (toddlers are picky!), so at least her uninspired meals are home cooked.
 We also see her washing Ralphie’s mouth out with a huge bar of red soap after he says “the queen mother of dirty words.” My son said his first curse word this year also, only he’s 3 years old instead of 9 like Ralphie. Rather than stuffing soap in his mouth, I looked away to hide my laughter and to avoid giving the word any attention. Mother didn’t have the luxury of reading fancy books by child psychologists instructing her about what to do when kids curse. What she did have was a big bar of soap.
 Mother might not get treated like a superstar, but Dillon received top billing in “A Christmas Story.” She came to the film with a Tony nomination for her Broadway debut in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” plus two Academy Award nominations, for “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “Absence of Malice.” Dillon started out as the first coat check girl at the improv theater The Second City in Chicago, but when her career quickly took off, she was overwhelmed by the prospect of fame. She turned her energy away from acting and toward marriage and kids. The role of real-life suburban mom quickly lost its allure, though.
 “I got buried alive,” Dillon said of her stay-at-home stint in a 1976 interview with The Times. She went back to work.
 Reading that, it’s hard not to imagine that Dillon brought some of those feelings to the role of a woman who, as Ralphie says early on in the movie, “hadn’t had a hot meal for herself in 15 years.”
 She’s not just a meatloaf-baking pushover, though. Mother has mastered the art of outsmarting her husband. She uses stealth tactics to convince him not to turn on the hideous leg lamp he won in a contest, like suggesting he keep it off so they don’t waste electricity (this qualifies as a stealth tactic in my eyes). She later not-so-subtly asserts her authority by destroying the leg lamp in a fit of rage. I cheered her on with every off-camera smash. Deprived of hot meals and cooped up at home, she needs this.

As for there being "too many of us", that's a given. Population growth tends to level off, though, so you'll see anxious articles appearing from economists about shortfalls in the labor market, the need to import labor and so on. (You can't have a tight labor market -- that increases the bargaining power of the workforce.) Religion chimes in here; regardless of the actual belief system they all seem to have a few things in common -- the "sanctity of womanhood" (i.e. as a unit of worker/soldier production), belief in leadership and of course, the perennial "pie in the sky (when you die)" ("its a lie").

 # CoxHealth delivers first vaccines, receives shipment of 7,000 Moderna doses
 Katie Kull
 Springfield News-Leader
 Springfield's CoxHealth reached a major milestone Monday afternoon, inoculating about 300 staff members in the system with Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine.
 "I feel hopeful," said registered nurse Amy Martin, the first person to get the vaccine at Cox South. "The more people that get this vaccine, the better, and hopefully we can see the numbers go down and a lot less death."
 On Tuesday morning, roughly 7,000 doses of Moderna vaccine were delivered at the hospital and will be distributed to Cox hospitals throughout southwest Missouri.
 In a speech before the first vaccines were given Monday, CoxHealth CEO Steve Edwards called the development and delivery of the vaccines a "miracle," and said it would help the hospital protect its employees.
 "Our community has not always been on board (with taking measures to protect you), our region has not been on board, and this is a moment where it doesn't really matter anymore," Edwards said in the recorded remarks. "We're going to give you this vaccine, and it will, with 95 percent effectiveness, be a super powerful shield to protect you."
 Mercy Hospital in Springfield inoculated its first employees last week with the Pfizer vaccine and was expecting to get more doses over the coming days.
 People in long-term care facilities will also begin to be vaccinated in the coming days by employees from CVS and Walgreens, according to the state health department.

Kathmandu [Nepal], December 22 (ANI): Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the newly appointed spokesperson of the Nepal Communist Party, revealed that a vote of no-confidence was planned against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.   Answering questions from reporters about the Central Committee Meeting called by Oli at Baluwatar, Gyawali said that the signatures of lawmakers from the ruling Nepal Communist Party were used to prepare a draft to table the no- confidence motion against Oli.   "What was the unnecessary work that the government tried to do which prompted a rush early in the morning? Use the signatures collected for preparing a draft of vote of no confidence against Prime Minister," said Gyawali on Tuesday.   Sources confirmed to ANI that the vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Oli was registered on early Sunday morning, about an hour after Oli convened an emergency cabinet meeting making recommendations to dissolve the parliament.   Lawmakers from the Nepal Communist Party which included some of the ministers on board the Oli government have also signed the document which was later leaked to the media on Sunday evening.   On December 20, President Bidhya Devi Bhandari later ratified the proposal floated by Oli dissolving the parliament. Oli has also presented the dates for holding elections in April end and early May in 2021.   Elected via General Assembly Election of 2017, Nepal Communist Party, an amalgamation of former communist forces of the Himalayan Nation had a majority of 116 seats in parliament. It had run short of four seats to gain a two- thirds majority in the lower house but was able to form the government with 64 per cent of the votes in favour of Oli.  
 Briefing central committee members, Oli on Tuesday directed everyone to prepare for the forthcoming election when he expects to get a popular vote of 5 million and a complete majority of two-third in the parliament.   "In the election, we should be able to secure at least 5 million popular votes, that too from proportional representation. We secured a total of 116 seats in parliament-- a joint effort of two parties, we won 116 seats that time and now we need to add 4 more into previous numbers and win total of 120 seats," said Oli in his address to Central Committee members on Tuesday.   The Dahal-Nepal and KP Oli faction in the ruling party on Tuesday convened two separate meetings of the Central Working Committee.   The Dahal-Nepal faction, which had a majority on basis of the number of Central Committee Members expelled Oli from the post of chairman, while taking disciplinary action.   The faction led by Oli has claimed that a working committee meeting that isn't attended by the party secretary cannot be considered legitimate.   At a meeting held in the early hours of Tuesday at Baluwatar, the Oli-led faction also expanded the number of Central Working Committee members adding 556 members to the existing 446.   The meeting also decided to hold the party's unity convention from November 18, 2021. Earlier the party's convention was scheduled from April 7 to 12, 2021. (ANI)

Now about 'Marxists'. Will everyone please remember that Karl Marx was an economic theorist from the mid-1800s. He made revolutionary noises but wasn't a revolutionary in the Russian sense (and wasn't even a Russian). His era is that of the Paris Commune, not the October Revolution. His work is interesting and it is relevant today -- at least I'd guess it is by the sheer amoount of effort that goes into to trying to prove its 'irrelevant' or 'won't work' -- but it is mainly theoretical. He did most of his work in the UK (and was financed by a close friend, the Mancunian businessman Fredrich Engels). If you find yourself reviling "Marxism" as some knid of evil cult then you've probably been spoonfed propaganda since infancy -- like any variation of the dismal science Marxism is not evil, its not a cult, it just 'is'. Take it or leave it.

4) The World War I Allies never did immediately send a naval expedition to Petrograd to easily topple Lenin & Bolshevik's November 7, 1917 coup, thereby promptly returning Russia to the war, Russia's involvement in the war being a critical variable for the Allies' victory strategy against the Central Powers, proving (a) that the Allies knew they were going to win the war; (b) that the war was set up to (i) weaken the West's influence in the world; (ii) weaken the West's people's confidence in their institutions and what those institutions stood for; and (c) one objective of the war was to settle into power the first above board Marxist state, with more to follow. In fact, there already was an anti-Marxist force in Russia at the time that if ordered would have conquered all of Bolshevik Russia during this period when the Bolsheviks were very weak. The unit was the 60,000 strong Czechoslovak Legion (soon to be 100,000 strong) but instead of sending the legion 700 miles north to Petrograd, the Allies sent it on a 6,000 mile odyssey across Russia to Vladivostok for evacuation to Europe(!), once again proving the Allies knew they were going to win the war…that the war was a Marxist operation.*

The Los Angeles Sparks extended coach Derek Fisher's contract and appointed him the team's general manager on Tuesday.
 Fisher has guided the Sparks to a 37-19 record in his two years with the team and Los Angeles has reached the postseason both years.
 “I’m honored to be named general manager of the LA Sparks and continue my role as head coach,” Fisher said. “This organization has a dynamic history, the most passionate fans in the WNBA, and an ownership group committed to success on and off the court. I’m thankful for the opportunity and excited to guide this team as we pursue a fourth WNBA title.”
 Five of the 12 teams in the league have a coach also serving as the franchise's general manager. Fisher joked that he separated himself from the negotiation for the contract extension as coach as it was handled by the team's chief operating officer.
 One of his first responsibilities as GM will be to bring back star Candace Parker, who is a free agent. Fisher made it clear that the franchise player isn't going anywhere.
 “We have every intention to re-sign Candace Parker and make sure she finishes her career in LA,” he said. “There is no hesitation or discussion, that is a priority of ours. Our intentions are that Candace never plays another game for any other team.”

 # A plan by Eastern states to cap tailpipe emissions gets off to a slow start
 By Brad Plumer
 The New York Times |
 Dec 22, 2020  at 11:21 AM
 WASHINGTON — An ambitious plan by Eastern states for a regional cap-and-trade program to curb greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks got off to a slow start Monday after just three states — Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island — plus Washington, D.C., formally agreed to adopt it.
 The program’s backers had originally aimed for broader participation and expressed hope that more states might join later. Last year, 11 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, making up a fifth of the United States population, signed on to a draft version of the plan, which would set a cap, to be lowered over time, on the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be released from vehicles that use gasoline or diesel for fuel.

There are rhythms and cycles to the stories that Henriquez tells, first a push then a lull then a push again. To complete her doctorate, for example, there first had to be a period of intense study, then a period of setting the thesis aside, then again a period of intense study and writing.
