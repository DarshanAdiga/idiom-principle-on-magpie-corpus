Auch für die 16 Fachkräfte – darunter Sozialpädagogen, Psychologen, Sozialarbeiter – sei dies eine ungewöhnliche Situation. „Eigentlich beraten wir ,face to face'“, sagt Sabine Bittner, Leiterin der Familien- und Schulberatungsstelle. Da dies aber aktuell wegfalle, bietet das Team telefonische Beratungen an. „Darüber kann ebenfalls eine Menge erreicht werden.“ Die Beratung ist anonymisiert möglich. „Eltern müssen ihren Namen nicht nennen. Die meisten machen es aber.“
 ## Team ruft bekannte Familien an
 Eltern und Familien, die der Beratungsstelle bekannt sind, ruft das Team aktuell schon an. „Wir fragen, wie es ihnen geht und von einigen hören wir schon, wie groß der Stress in den Familien ist“, berichtet Sabine Bittner. Diese hätten zahlreiche zusätzliche Aufgaben. So muss der schulische Alltag nach Hause verlegt werden, Betreuungsmöglichkeiten und Freizeitangebote fallen weg. Kinder und Erwachsene können ihre Freunde nicht sehen. „Der Aktivitätsradius ist eingeschränkt und dazu kommen noch psychosoziale Probleme, die sich durch Sorge um den Arbeitsplatz entwickeln können.“
 Keine Familie sei spannungsfrei. Aber es gelte jetzt herauszufinden, welche Ressourcen man nutzen könne. Fragen wie: „Gibt es einen Garten? Welche Möglichkeiten gibt es, die Lage etwas zu entspannen? Wie kann ich die Kids richtig auspowern, damit sie keinen Lagerkoller bekommen?“ gelte es zu klären. „Strukturen sind sehr wichtig“, erklärt Stephanie Jordan. „Deshalb sollte man Fixpunkte festlegen.“ Das kann Zeit sein, in der die Kinder sich selbst beschäftigen, in der sie etwas für die Schule tun, aber auch Zeit, die positiv besetzt ist. „Viele Familien gehen mit den Kinder spazieren oder Fahrrad fahren.“ Diese Familienzeit, die im Alltag oft zu kurz komme, könne man regelmäßig einbauen.

WASHINGTON -- The World Bank's board is finalizing a package of coronavirus relief valued at up to $160 billion over the next 15 months, the development lender's president, David Malpass said on Thursday.
 "The goals are to shorten the time to recovery; create conditions for growth; support small and medium enterprises; and help protect the poor and vulnerable," Malpass said in a statement issued after a G20 leaders call on Thursday.
 He added that the health crisis hit close to home, as former World Bank U.S. executive director Carole Brookins has died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. (Reporting by David Lawder and Andrea Shalal Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

Even with the Federal Prospects Hockey League shutting down early because of the coronavirus pandemic, league commissioner Don Kirnan says this has been their best season ever.
 With expansion last year, the league grew by four teams to 10 franchises, coinciding with the circuit’s 10th year of existence.
 “It was obviously the best season we’ve ever had, it’s the most fans we’ve ever had,” Kirnan said of the league.
 The league welcomed back one city to the fold in the Danbury Hat Tricks in Connecticut and also took in three others communities in the Delaware Thunder, the Columbus River Dragons in Georgia and the Battle Creek Rumble Bees in Michigan.
 With the new entrants, plus six teams that returned to the league for the season, including the Watertown Wolves, the league drew more than a quarter of a million fans in the shortened season.
 “It was our best season, we drew probably 350,000 fans from a league standpoint, so that’s very successful,” said Kirnan, who added that’s approximately 100,000 more than any other FHL season.
 The Watertown Wolves played at the Elmira Enforcers on March 12 on a Thursday night, and the game proved to be the last pro hockey game to take place in North America as during the game the league announced it was suspending its season. Four days later, the league announced it had canceled its season, as four weeks of the regular season as well as three rounds of playoffs were wiped out.
 “Nobody’s gone through this before,” Kirnan said of the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m older, so I remember when the president was assassinated and we all remember 9/11. This seems to be worse than anything I’ve seen in my lifetime, so it seems to be really crazy times right now.”
 Kirnan and the FPHL saw no other way to continue the league this season and took the lead of the other pro hockey leagues in shutting down.
 “I think as things turned out, we were mandated by the state to restrict capacity and it would have been impossible for us to carry on,” Kirnan said. “We’re dealing in multiple states, like in Michigan, they were allowing nobody until the middle of April and certain other states were restricted down to 100 or 200 people.
 “No. 1, I think that a lot of people were concerned about the safety of going to games anyway and in New York we were at 500 (people allowed) when we shut down, I think it’s down to 50 right now.”
 “We decided it’s just better to suspend operations at the time,” Kirnan added.
 The FPHL sits on the lowest rung of the pro hockey ladder in the minor leagues, behind the Southern Professional Hockey League, the East Coast Hockey League and the American Hockey League.
 “I know some other franchises and teams in the minor leagues have taken a hit of almost a million dollars with the shutdown,” Kirnan said. “So it’s just been a disaster for everybody, really.”
 Still, even with the money lost across the FPHL because of the shutdown, Kirnan was optimistic about the future of the league.
 “It’s never been better,” Kirnan said of the league. “Obviously we’re happy with the direction of the league, it’s going great.”
 Elmira (76,919 total attendance), Carolina (76,425) and Columbus (76,142) led the way, with Elmira and Columbus drawing an average of 3,077 and 3,046 fans per game, and Carolina 2,831, respectively, according to the league website.
 Danbury (30,398), Watertown (22,861) and Danville (22,752) round out the top six, with Port Huron (19,693) ranking seventh in the 10-team league.
 “Carolina’s attendance went up, Elmira’s was pretty much what they had the year before, so we had some strong teams. Getting Danbury was great,” said Kirnan, who also owns the Wolves franchise. “We had some big turnouts and a lot of positives as far as that goes.”
 Kirnan said the Wolves are standing on firm ground as well.
 “Everything is good, everything is solid,” Kirnan said. “The last two years are the only years where there hasn’t been a huge loss.”
 In fact, Watertown has made money the past two years and is one of eight teams in the league to finish in the black this season, Kirnan said.
 “Last year, Mentor didn’t break even, this year it was Mentor and Battle Creek, everybody else was OK,” Kirnan said. “Which is unheard of in minor- league sports where 70 or 80 percent of the teams don’t make money. So this is two years in a row that we’ve done pretty well and Battle Creek was a last- minute entry.”
 “So we’re trying to ramp things up and trying to improve things and make things better for everybody,” Kirnan said. “We’re trying to improve the product all the time.”
 Kirnan is also pleased and encouraged with the attendance in league cities like Columbus, where the Columbus Civic Center sports a capacity of 7,259.
 “The Columbus facility had one crowd over 5,000, which is almost three times what our building seats,” Kirnan said of the Wolves seating capacity of 1,500 at Watertown Municipal Arena.
 At present it’s unclear whether there will be further expansion in the FPHL for next season.
 One prime expansion candidate is in Bloomington, Ill., which would gave the state two league franchises along with the Danville Dashers.
 “That’s a 6,000- or 8,000-(seat) building, too, it’s a beautiful building,” Kirnan said of Bloomington.
 Kirnan says the league will “probably be a 10-team next year,” but said anything can happen in terms of potential expansion.
 “Things have really worked out well and I don’t know if we’re going to expand next year or not,” Kirnan said. “Some of the stuff going on right now, it’s hard to say because everything’s kind of in a lockdown right now, so business is not as usual and we can’t even do normal things right now.
 “So it’s uncharted territory for everybody right now.”
 He was also pleased with the balance of play in the league this season as eight of the 10 teams in the league would have competed in the playoffs.
 “We had several teams that really felt they had a chance to win a championship, so the league was very competitive,” Kirnan said. “And who knows what would have happened?”

For starters, there would have to be The Couch, and of course the backdrop would be Central Perk, the New York City coffee shop where whole gang would hang out (and never actually drink coffee).  
 "I searched everywhere for something remotely close to the _Friends_ couch, and the closest thing was a brown couch," she says.
 It was also $200 and didn't exactly evoke those Central Perk vibes.
 So, she decided to call up her good friend Danielle Shunk, who owns the furniture and home design business Sincerely Danielle Shunk.
 "I asked if she had any ideas of where I could find a couch," Penn recalls. "She goes, 'What if I just made it from scratch?”  
 And just like that, Penn got the perfect mini replica of The Couch. (You can check out how it was made right here.)

Cady said the entire situation, which lasted less than an hour from hold-up to pick up, was a “great example of the interagency cooperation we have in Oswego County.”
 In January, the Post reported Neilly has been busted on more than a dozen charges of allegedly knocking over Chase and Citibank branches in Manhattan during a several-months-long spree in 2019. The Post also reported in the same January article that Neilly was “released… under the controversial new bail reform measures.” New York this year has enacted a number of reforms to the way defendants are treated before jail, with opponents saying the justice system now lets criminals back on the streets too easily.
 Mayor Billy Barlow took the opportunity to decry the legislation, passed last year and enforced starting Jan. 1, 2020.
 “Unfortunately, thanks to New York State’s so-called ‘bail reform laws,’ the constant repeat offender responsible for multiple robberies known as the “Burberry Bandit” was allowed to walk the streets free and venture to Oswego to commit another robbery”.
 According to OPD, the alleged incident began at approximately 1:02 p.m. March 25, when Neilly and two other individuals in a 2003 red Chevrolet Malibu pulled a up to the Chase Bank at 204 W. 1st St., Oswego. Police said the driver of the car was hired by Neilly for a ride to Oswego from Watertown. The third individual was a friend of the driver. Neither the driver or the driver’s friend knew anything of what was about to unfold, police said. As neither have been charged and are not considered suspects (“unwittingly involved,” police said) their names are being withheld.
 Neilly exited the Chevy Malibu, police said, and entered the Chase Bank. He then allegedly passed a note to a teller “demanding money,” police said. With the proceeds allegedly in hand, he then exited the bank and re-entered the car.

We may at this time feel very detached from everything, but in communion with Christ we can never be spiritually isolated from his Church. It is important to remember that all of the Church’s prayer and devotional life links us to the Mass and to the Cross of Jesus. Because the Mass is the source and summit of our faith, all other liturgies and devotions flow from its celebration and are made sense of in their relationship to it. Our prayers, offices and piety can never be detached from the Mass and are, through their relationship to the Mass, rooted in the redeeming work of Christ.

Wall Street gained more ground on Thursday as the record weekly jobless claims came in below investors' worst fears, but added to the case for more stimulus to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to 3.28 million last week as lockdowns across the country brought economic activity to a sudden halt and unleashed a wave of layoffs, but were still below estimates ranging as high as 4 million.
 "It's unprecedented and the highest it's been since the metric even began in the '60s," said Mike Loewengart, managing director, investment strategy at E*Trade Financial in New Jersey.
 "That said, it's no secret that times will be tough on the jobs front for the foreseeable future, so even a number this large is relatively priced in. The real question at hand now is if the current stimulus package is enough to give Americans the support they need."
 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday the central bank would act "aggressively" to keep firms and families afloat, after already announcing an unprecedented policy easing earlier this week.
 Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate passed a whopping $2 trillion stimulus package to aid distressed industries and millions of Americans devastated by the health crisis.
 The S&P 500 is now on pace for its third straight session of gains, the index's longest run since Feb. 12, but has only recouped a fraction of the nearly $8 trillion in value lost since a record high last month as the pandemic showed no signs of peaking.
 Traders expect more wild swings as fears of a deep and lasting global recession and corporate defaults rage amid a breakdown in business activity.
 "This is the beginning of the really bad numbers we're going to see for the foreseeable month," said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.
 The CBOE volatility index fell 4.4 points in early trading, but was still near levels far above those in 2018 and 2019.
 United Airlines, Delta and American Airlines rose between 5.4% and 8%, while Boeing rose 7% as the U.S. Senate aid bill included a $58 billion provision for the aerospace industry.
 At 10:00 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 631.29 points, or 2.98%, at 21,831.84, the S&P 500 was up 75.07 points, or 3.03%, at 2,550.63. The Nasdaq Composite was up 194.36 points, or 2.63%, at 7,578.66.
 All 11 major S&P sectors was trading higher, with a 2.9% gain in technology stocks providing the biggest boost.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners nearly 5-to-1 on the NYSE and 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq.
 The S&P index recorded no new 52-week high or low, while the Nasdaq logged one new high and six new lows. (Reporting by Uday Sampath and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Ross Kerber in New York; Editing by Anil D'Silva, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Arun Koyyur)

I look at my staff and volunteers who continue to come to APL even though they may be afraid and realize how blessed we are to have such dedication and passion. Shelters across the country are facing the crisis of how best to care for their animals in this hard time. We are all trying to figure out how to do adoptions/fosters and yet still be safe.
 Off-site adoptions are continuing with our adoption partners for the time being. As this continues, we can’t help but panic a bit at what may be coming — increased intake and decreased adoptions and animals sent to rescue. Increased intake means more food, vaccinations, medications, etc., which drives up our costs and it also means a drastic reduction in financial donations/supplies until this is over and the economy recovers. We are going to have to be very creative and innovative in the coming months.
 We are trying to take this one day at a time; no matter what happens the animals will need our care and attention. If you are able to foster/adopt a cat or dog that would help us greatly. Go to inapl.org to fill out an application. If you have gone through our volunteer orientation and would like to help, that would be great. We, of course, ask that you do not come sick and follow all our sanitizing protocols.
 Take comfort in your friends, family and pets, and please do not bring your pets to the shelters because you are afraid they can spread the virus. All studies to date say they cannot; so please keep them with you. I know my pets are helping me stay grounded during this difficult time. In the coming weeks and months, I wish you all … enough. Be safe my friends.
