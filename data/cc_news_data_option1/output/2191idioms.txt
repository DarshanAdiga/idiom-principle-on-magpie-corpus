How much time preparing for an event? Upwards of six to eight hours a day behind the wheel. My eyes start to glaze over after 60 minutes in the saddle, but deJong told me this is an acquired skill. "A couple of years ago I could't drive more than a couple hours a day before I stopped taking in information and stopped improving, but now I can pretty much drive for six hours and keep improving."


  Check the video above and you'll see how much I need to keep improving myself. Despite being woefully outclassed, I still learned a lot and, if nothing else, had a great time chatting. You can read more about Mitchell deJong's successes in the virtual Supercup at Porsche Motorsports.

I'd qualified a mediocre 18th out of about 28 early entrants (some of whom ducked out before the frequently delayed race), but after the green flag flew I gained a number of positions, weaving my way through the dented remains of many an Huracan GT3 Evo. It seemed like half the field didn't even make it to the first chicane.


  Later in the race I'd be viciously blocked multiple times, was run off the road by a lapped car who wouldn't let me pass and, suffice to say, I saw a lot of hijinks that left me gesticulating like an Italian myself. I ran as high as 10th and desperately wanted to finish there, but at the end of the day, I was happy to just survive and come home 11th.


  ##  All you need is love and time


  Every mediocre racer needs a colorful palette of excuses and, as you've surely already deduced, mine mostly involve time. Specifically, the lack thereof. Running a site like this and managing the team of talented individuals who make it happen is not a nine-to-five assignment. Finding a free hour or four to sit in a chair with a funny headset strapped to my face is a difficult proposition.


  While there are notable exceptions, sim-racing naturals who are blisteringly quick as soon as they take a seat, I've learned it's generally time invested that separates the really, really good from the merely capable.


  But there's another key factor at play and that's love. Nobody would spend that much time stationary if they didn't love this stuff. As someone who's raced both online and IRL, the adrenaline rush is remarkably similar and just as addicting. Today, two decades on, my affinity for the sport of sim racing is stronger than ever. Opportunities like these just fan the flames.


  So, who wants to school me next?

Word of the fire did not reach government officials in Wisconsin's capital for days, Kahl said. However, help finally began making its way to those in need when Francis Fairchild, the wife of Wisconsin governor Lucius Fairchild, received word of the tragedy.


  The blazes were a wake-up call about the land-use practices of the time as communities searched for answers in the wake of the tragedy. Slash-and-burn lumbering, construction from the expanding railroads and daily use of flame all contributed to the cause of the fires that proved so destructive. But the weather in the months leading up to the blaze also played a crucial factor in creating dangerous conditions that allowed for the disastrous outcome.


  Meteorologists explain that a long period of drought, fierce winds and high temperatures all created fuel for flames -- dry trees, leaves and grass.


  The fire expanded exponentially when a powerful storm over the Plains unleashed strong, warm southwesterly winds of up to 50 mph. The storm was not accompanied by much rainfall and the strong gusts fanned the flames, causing everything in its path to ignite.


  "A powerful area of low pressure in the Plains ushered strong southwesterly winds and they gusted up to 50 mph in some areas, fanning the already ongoing fires and hot spots," AccuWeather Broadcast Meteorologist Geoff Cornish explained.


  These winds also brought very warm and dry air across the region, providing ideal conditions for the spread of pre-existing wildfires and any new infernos that ignited.


  Some may wonder how meteorologists can be certain of the weather conditions that preceded the wildfires nearly 150 years ago. Cornish explained that meteorologists' modern weather analysis is based on data gathered by NOAA, and that in the mid-19th century, the U.S. began seeing the emergence of more reliable weather record-keeping in bigger cities.


  "It became common for weather observers to write down daily weather data such as high and low temps, precipitation amounts and descriptions of the sky," Cornish said, adding that the 1871 data is particularly reliable because official weather records for Chicago were kept starting that very year.

About five more officers and a female all arrived a few minutes later.

With countries under a global lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, and dealing with its outbreak and spread, the one positive quotient that seems to have emerged out of this situation is that it's helped the environment become better. Pollution levels have exponentially reduced, the air has become cleaner, and there's more consciousness about the way forward in everyone's minds. After all, it's when we take care of the environment around us, that it shall take care of us in return and benefit us. World Environment Day is celebrated every year on June 5 to remind people that we should not take nature for granted. The theme for World Environment Day 2020 is 'Celebrate Biodiversity' which shall be hosted in Colombia, in partnership with Germany. The theme is a relevant one in the current scenario because human beings need other living beings to survive and co-exist as biodiversity is important for everyone.On World Environment Day today, a new book tells the stories of 10 Indian conservationists who are striving to solve the most pressing problems on the planet - from climate change to habitat degradation, and from food insecurity to species loss, often facing seemingly insurmountable odds.Authors Bijal Vachharajani and Radha Rangarajan say their book "10 Indian Champions Who are Fighting to Save the Planet" is being published at a time when the world is overheated, and globally, temperatures are rising steadily - the carbon in the atmosphere has crossed 415 parts per million (350 ppm is a safe level), and a million species are at risk of going the dodo way.The authors say when they started work on the book, they were filled with dread at the prospect of picking only 10 people. "We made lists, scratched out the lists, re-did the lists and made more lists. Our first list had the great stalwarts of environment and wildlife, yesterday's and today's - Salim Ali, Indira Gandhi, J Vijaya, Shehla Masood, M Krishnan, Anupam Mishra, Zafar Futehally, Bittu Sahgal." But then they realised they wanted to talk about today and tomorrow, the problems and the solutions and meet these everyday heroes, both young and old. "So we set out to conduct interviews - we travelled to Tamil Nadu to meet Romulus Whitaker; we drank copious cups of coffee with Kavitha Kuruganti and Aparajita Datta in Bengaluru; sneaked out of an elephant fest in Delhi to talk to Jay Mazoomdaar," they say.Vachharajani and Rangarajan want this book to establish that the environment is not the other - "it's a dynamic part of each of us, and we are a part of the environment".Talking about her experience of writing the book, Vachharajani says it was an "adventure, where we got to talk to some amazing nature defenders and listen to them".Rangarajan adds, "We are in the middle of a pandemic, while already being deep in a climate crisis - both of which have been caused by our excessive meddling with the environment. Every expert we spoke to made us hyper-aware of the fact that they still continue to learn new things from nature."\-- with agency inputsFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

Susan Clarkson had no choice but to come clean. When Bransholme police came to her family home in March of 2019 -- after receiving a call for assistance that the children's 39-year-old father, Gareth Clarkson, had gone missing -- they insisted on checking the house first. It was at that point she told them they might find a little something extra inside the house, according to _HullLive_.
 That bit of extra happened to be a cannabis grow in one of the bedrooms, where police found a black tent, growing equipment and 20 marijuana plants not quite ready for harvest. But it was the reasoning for the small grow op that would prove to be a source of sympathy at trial.

Pet Shop Boys было очень гротескное произведение "Go west". Это была в своём роде ода победителям в холодной войне, которые смогли разрушить СССР без единого выстрела. Ранее уже существовала песня с одноимённым названием, смысл которой сводился к тому, что на западе США, в Сан-Франциско, образовалась некая зона для свободной жизни лиц с нетрадиционной ориентацией. И этой песней этих лиц, в общем, агитировали идти на запад. И здесь, очень тонко стебаясь, в группе Pet Shop Boys перехватили сюжет и изобразили в клипе пародию на советских людей, которых освободили, и которые хлынули в западном направлении. Для того времени получилось очень мастерски. Что поделать, такие вот они, артисты. Как там по Фрейду, любая тяга человека к созданию произведений искусства идёт от нереализованных сексуальных потребностей. Возразить нечем. Примеров тому масса.
