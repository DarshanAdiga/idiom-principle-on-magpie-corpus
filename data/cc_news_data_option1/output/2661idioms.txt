He reduced the golf course to a pitch-and-putt with power that got everyone's attention. That was John Daly at Crooked Stick in 1991 when he followed his caddie's instructions — “Kill it!” — on his way to winning the PGA Championship. It was Tiger Woods at Augusta National in 1997, when he hit pitching wedge into a par 5 and won the Masters by 12 shots. Not to be forgotten is J.B. Holmes at the Phoenix Open in 2006. He hit 4-iron from 263 yards — back when a 263-yard shot over water to a par 5 was considered a risk — and finished with a tee shot that took bunkers, water, everything out of play. Fascination with the long ball is nothing new, and the hype gets even stronger when it leads to the lowest score. Bryson DeChambeau took that to another level last week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic. Along with getting the result that matters — the trophy — he had some of the gaudiest numbers golf has ever seen, at least since the PGA Tour developed the statistical tools to measure them. DeChambeau finished with a 367-yard drive at Detroit Golf Club — his fourth-longest shot of the week — that set up a flip wedge to 3 feet for birdie and ultimately a three-shot victory. Since the PGA Tour resumed its schedule a month ago, it was the 29th time he's had a drive go 350 yards or longer. Sixteen of those were in Detroit, where he was able to “unleash the Kraken” far more often than he could at Colonial or Harbour Town. He hit a 374-yard drive on the 13th hole Saturday, which is why in the final round he waited for the green to clear on the 399-yard hole and let Troy Merritt go first. “I don't do that very often,” DeChambeau said. “And hopefully, I can have that going on a lot more down the road. That would be a lot of fun.” Is there no end to how...

(AP) - The heat is on. And for most of America it’ll stay on through the rest of the month and maybe longer, meteorologists say.Widespread and prolonged extreme heat is baking the contiguous United States and meteorologists see no relief in sight, except for a brief time in a corner of the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp;Next week&nbsp;is likely to be worse than this week. And the entire Lower 48 states and Alaska are likely to be warmer than normal for the&nbsp;last two weeks of July,&nbsp;traditionally the hottest time of year, according to the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center.“It’s very widespread and it’s going to be very long lasting,” said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground and now a meteorologist at Yale Climate Connections. “It’s not a record-breaking heat wave, but it is notable for its persistence.”This is a dangerous type of heat where people need to be careful about heat stroke, stay indoors and drink plenty of water, meteorologists said.The National Weather Service&nbsp;warned of excessive heat&nbsp;on Tuesday for 18 million people, but that’s nothing compared to what’s coming up.At the end of this week, much of the nation will likely be passing or flirting with&nbsp;temperatures in the 90s. And it will likely feel even hotter in the South.Charleston,&nbsp;South Carolina, likely will feel 105 on Friday and then 108 on Saturday.&nbsp;Little Rock&nbsp;is forecast to feel like 107 and 109 on Friday and Saturday.&nbsp;Houston&nbsp;should feel like 109 Friday through Sunday.&nbsp;Phoenix&nbsp;is forecast to feel like 108 on Friday and 110 on Saturday and Sunday.Then it goes up a notch more.Next week, while close to two-thirds of the country will be warmer than normal, about 40% of the Lower 48 has a&nbsp;moderate risk of extreme and dangerous heat, said Climate Prediction Center meteorologist Matthew Rosencrans.Next week, Wisconsin could be battling it out with the Southeast for the nation's hottest feels-like temperature — which factors in humidity — with heat indices pushing past 100, Rosencrans said. And the worst prolonged heat looks to be around western Nebraska, Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle, with temperatures approaching 110, but without the sticky humidity.The weather maps are covered in blood red, dark brown and purple — colors signifying much hotter than normal temperatures. Rosencrans said he’s never seen temperature forecast maps like that at the hottest time of the year.A giant ridge of high pressure, parking hot air, is stuck in the Southwest and extends farther east that usual, blocking cold fronts from moving in, Rosencrans said. And the jet stream, a river of air that keeps weather moving, has retreated to Canada, so nothing is pushing the heat along. On top of that, dry weather feeds the heat in a “vicious feedback cycle,” he said.In Miami, which has experienced its hottest stretch on record, an unusually hot Atlantic Ocean is adding to the problem, not allowing it to cool below 80 at night, said Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist for BAM forecasts.Masters said there’s “very toasty water pretty much everywhere,” except near Greenland.Without extensive statistical and scientific analysis, meteorologists can’t say for sure that the heat is due to global warming, Rosencrans said. But this is what scientists expect more of with climate change, he and others said.Going into July, the world already was feeling the&nbsp;second hottest year&nbsp;on record and that’s a base to add natural variable warm weather factors on top of, Masters said.So what about relief? When do long-term forecast computer models show below-normal temperatures for significant parts of the country?Masters scrolled through the simulations. Not the rest of July. Not August. Not September. Not October. Not November.“It does not give us any false hope,” Masters said. “False hope or real hope is hard to come by.”___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at&nbsp;@borenbears___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Recent unrest in North Carolina cities and job losses related to COVID-19 closings are featured prominently in the first general election ad of the governor's race from Republican nominee Dan Forest. The television commercial began airing across the state Tuesday, the day after Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's campaign announced it will have a massive amount of cash entering the last four months of the campaign. The commercial initially shows footage of apparent looters inside a drug store, and Raleigh police sport utility vehicles with flashing lights and police tape. Forest has criticized Cooper for issuing executive orders that have closed certain businesses since March in an attempt to control the spread of the coronavirus, saying his strategy is misguided. He's also blamed the governor for failing to stop damage caused by some demonstrators within broader, otherwise peaceful protests against racial injustice following the May 25 death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police. “With over 1 million unemployed and our state in crisis, it’s time for change,\" the ad’s narrator says. ”Dan Forest will provide leadership, unity and hope for our state.” The commercial does not mention Cooper, or that Forest has been lieutenant governor for 7 1/2 years. But it described Forests's past career as an architect and promised he would “rebuild our economy\" while protecting “our most vulnerable.\" Cooper’s team said he’ll report by Friday’s campaign finance deadline as having raised another $5.5 million during a 4 1/2-month period that ended June 30. The report also will say Cooper had nearly $14 million in his campaign coffers entering July. This cash balance has given Cooper's campaign the confidence to already reserve TV ad time starting in September through Election Day....

ATLANTA (AP) — More than 100,000 Georgians have been confirmed to have coronavirus infections, as the number of people currently sick enough with COVID-19 to be hospitalized pushed past 2,000 on Tuesday. The milestones came as Gov. Brian Kemp urged local officials to join in his push for voluntary mask-wearing in public, even while acknowledging that some local officials want him to go further. “We don’t need a mandate to have Georgians do the right thing, but we do need to build strong, public support,” Kemp told mayors and county commissioners on a conference call Tuesday, according to a statement released by the Republican's office. “Let’s work together — with a unified voice — to remind Georgians what’s effective and important in this fight against COVID-19.” Georgia has averaged more than 20,000 tests a day over the past week, the highest level on record since the pandemic began. That high level of testing could account for some of the increase in new confirmed infections. But the number of cases is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. But an increasing number of people are sick enough to enter the hospital, a number that has doubled to more than 2,000 in the last two weeks. Deaths from the respiratory illness have been increasing more slowly, which could indicate that doctors are getting better at treating the disease, or that younger, healthier people are getting sick. But deaths typically lag hospitalizations, and could increase in the future. The number of confirmed fatalities rose to at least 2,899 in Georgia on Tuesday. Kemp is urging voluntary compliance but has said he won’t order masks to be worn statewide. The city of Savannah has ordered all people inside businesses to...

In it, two handsome young porters carry a Dior dollhouse filled with miniature dresses through an enchanted woodland populated by magical creatures — nymphs, giant snail, living statue, mermaid, Adam and Eve (or some such naked couple kissing in a tree), Pan (or some such beautiful horned fellow) and Narcissus, whose Sophia Petrillo-meets-Horshack hairdo should have been rethought.

On July 2, 2020, Donald Arthur Knowlton of Wooster, Ohio formerly of North Royalton, Ohio left us to join his Heavenly Family. He was born in Warren, Ohio on December 31, 1940 to Arthur E. and Leta (Stern) Knowlton. He grew up in Champion, Ohio, graduating from Champion High School in 1958. He served as Senior Class President and lettered in three varsity sports. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from Bowling Green State University where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. He was awarded a Master's Degree in Political Science, graduating with Honors, from Kent State University. While teaching at Howland High School in 1963, he met and married on December 24, 1964 the love of his life and his partner for nearly 56 years, Nancy Lansdowne Knowlton who survives. In 1967, he began his life career with the National Labor Relations Board in the Regional Office in Cleveland, Ohio. Don became a Supervisory Examiner, and in 1979 was appointed the Assistant Regional Director, the youngest ARD in the country. He served the NLRB for 35 years, retiring in 2002. He was well respected and often praised by his colleagues for his work ethic and the support he offered to them. Don was a true man of God, placing Him first in his life. He was a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Wooster, Ohio, having served as a Deacon. In North Royalton, Ohio, he served as a Deacon and Elder at Parma South Presbyterian Church. His religious beliefs were the guiding force in his life, and always tried to live by the Golden Rule. His true treasure was his family. He leaves his son, David Charles (Andrea) of Wooster, Ohio, Scott Arthur (Elise) of Arlington, Virginia, and Meridith Anne McCarthy (Jason) of Daphne, Alabama, and his precious granddaughters Julia Anne and Lydia Knowlton. His love encompassed his nieces and nephews, Tracy Cope (Tim), Amanda Elampooranar (Kal), Marlena van den Berg (Maarten), Bill Lansdowne (Karen), Jeanne Henrich (Michael), sister-in-law, Sennie Lansdowne, brother- in-law, Tim Wolfe, step-grandchildren, Shaun, Cohen, Araiyah, his cousins who many thought of him as a brother, and best friends from all walks of life. Don enjoyed traveling, especially to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. His extensive Knowlton genealogical research began there and turned into lifelong research projects which led to authoring many manuscripts, including some of his ship building ancestors. Many have used his resources. With his Ohio Family research, he was approved for membership by the Ohio Genealogical Society in The First Families of Ohio for having ancestors living in Ohio before 1821. He loved sports, the Cleveland Indians, the Browns, the Cavs, Ohio State football, and the "Fighting Scots" of the College of Wooster. He was a high school baseball coach and coached his sons' Little League teams. He enjoyed watching all the sports activities of his children and granddaughters. So many memories never to be replicated, but so thankful to have. He will be missed by so many that loved him. Don was preceded in death by his parents, sister, Patricia Wolfe and brother-in-law, Bill Lansdowne. Memorial contributions may be made to the First Presbyterian Church, 621 College Ave., Wooster, Ohio 44691 and The Wilderness Center, 9877 Alabama Ave. SW, Wilmot, Ohio 44689. Because of the world situation, there will be no calling hours. A Celebration of Don's life will be held at an appropriate time. The family has planned a private graveside service. "The Lord has not made a finer man." McIntire, Bradham &amp; Sleek Funeral Home, 216 E. Larwill St., Wooster is assisting the family.
