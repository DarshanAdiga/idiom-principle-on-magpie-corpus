4月の日本ツアーが中止となってしまったボブ・ディランが、3月27日（金）に新曲「マーダー・モスト・ファウル」のデジタル配信を開始した。これは2012年に発表されたアルバム『テンペスト』以来となる自作曲で、ブートレッグ・シリーズや来日記念盤を除くと8年振りとなる新作の発表だ。      ディランが2016年12月にノーベル文学賞を授与されてから初の書下ろしとなる楽曲が発表された。かつてない17分にも及ぶ物語性あるこの曲のタイトル「マーダー・モスト・ファウル」とはハムレットに登場するフレーズ。2012年作『テンペスト』はシェイクスピアの最後の作品『ザ・テンペスト』と同じタイトルであり、ノーベル文学賞受賞時やMusicare Person Of The Yearでも彼はシェイクスピアについて語っている。      第35代アメリカ合衆国大統領であるジョン・Ｆ・ケネディの暗殺から始まるこの歌は、主に六十年代に起きた数々の出来事や時代を彩ったミュージシャン、曲名をコラージュ風に投げかける。ディランの訥々と物語を紡ぐように繰り広げるヴォーカルは静かで穏やかながら揺るぎがない。ジャケットに使われた大統領執務室で写るジョン・Ｆ・ケネディは、1961年1月に43歳で大統領に就任し、1963年11月にテキサス州ダラスで暗殺される。僅か3年にも満たない在任中、東西冷戦、ベトナム戦争、公民権運動、宇宙開発競争など数多くの難問を背負っていた。彼にはマフィアやマリリン・モンローとの噂などもつきまとったが、何よりも平和への希求が高く今でも人気を誇る大統領で、彼に関する数多くの映画や書物が生まれ、度重なる検証にもかかわらず暗殺された背景は今でも謎に包まれている。そんな短くも波乱に富んだケネディの、血に染まった暗殺事件からこの歌は始まる。      ボブ・ディラン コメント   「私のファンと熱心なフォロワーの方々へ、長年のご支援とご献身に感謝を込めて挨拶致します。この度公開するのは以前録音した歌で皆さんに興味を持って頂ける未発表曲です。どうぞ安全に過ごされますように、油断する事がありませんように、そして神があなたと共にありますように」            マーダー・モスト・ファウル      それは63年11月の暗い日   永遠に私の中に生き続ける日   ケネディ大統領は生贄の羊のごとく屠殺された   待て 私が誰か知ってるのか？   もちろん知ってるさ   車に乗ったままの頭を彼らは吹っ飛ばした   白昼堂々、犬のように撃ち殺された   時間の問題だった   借りは返さねばならない   俺たちが集めに行く   嫌悪を持ってお前を殺す リスペクトすることなく   お前をあざけり ショックを与える   お前の後に就く者はいるのだ   何千もの目の前で脳みそは吹き飛ばされた   驚くほど あっという間に 完全な死刑執行   ウルマン（ジャック） ウルフマン（ジャック）   太鼓を鳴らせ ドンドン   これは最も卑劣な殺人      静かに子供たち お前達にはわからない   ビートルズがやってくる 君の手をとりに（to hold your hands)   マージーを渡ってフェリーでやってくる スリルを求め   ボロ布をまとった３人がやってくる   ピースを集めながら   俺はウッドストックにいこう   アクエリアスの時代   そしてオルタモントに行って、ステージの近くに座ろう      窓から顔を出して   楽しもう（Let the good times roll）   ガラス窓の奥ではパーティが始まっている   レンガを積み上げ コンクリを流せ   ダラスがあなたを愛してないとは言わないでくれ 大統領閣下      黒い顔 白い顔   太陽が沈んだら歩かない方がいい   赤線地帯をいく 海岸の警官みたいに   エルム街の悪魔みたいに生きている   あなたの国があなたに何をしてくれるかは尋ねるな      目に見えぬ者を撃てるのか   グッドバイ チャーリー グッドバイ アンクル・サム（アメリカ）   真実はなんだ？ どこに行ったのだ？   オズワルドに聞けば良い   仕事は仕事   これは最も卑劣な殺人      彼らは脳みそをとった   魂はあるべきところになかった   50年間探し続けてきた   自由 自由   言いたくないが、死んだ者しか自由になれないのだ   銃は未知の側溝に投げ捨て 歩き去る   起きろよリトル・スージー ドライヴに行こう   トリニティ川沿いを 目を開けて   ラジオをかけよう ダイアルはそのまま   パークランド病院まであと６マイル   ミス・リジー 僕はめまいがしそうさ（Dizzy Miss Lizzy) 血だらけで   俺は騙されやすい（patsy)人間なんだ パッツィ・クラインみたいに   人を後ろからも前からも撃ったことがない   目には血 耳にも血   ニューフロンティアにはたどり着けない      残虐で意地悪で   目も当てられないほど醜い   彼らは殺した 彼を 1回ならずとも2回も   人間の生贄のように   エアフォースワンがゲートに着く   いつタオルを投げるべきかと生きている   そういうものなのだ   これは最も卑劣な殺人      国の魂は投げ捨てられた   ゆっくりと朽ちている   審判の日まであと36時間   ウルマンジャックが延々と喋ってる   精一杯の声で   曲をかけてくれ Mr.ウルフマン・ジャック   キャディラックに乗ってる俺のために   若死にするのは善人だけ（Only The Good Die Young)をかけてくれ   トム・ドゥーリーが絞首刑にされた地に連れて行ってくれ（Tom Dooley)   クイーン・メアリー キング・ジェイムス   忘れなくないなら 名前を書いておけ   エタ・ジェイムスもかけてくれ Atlant Old Line   ジョン・リー・フッカー Scratch My Back   あとジャックっていうストリップ・バーのオーナーのためにかけてくれ   ギター・スリム Going Down Slow   かけてくれ 俺と マリリン・モンローのため      かけてくれ Please Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood   かけてくれ ファースト・レディのために 彼女 気分が悪いんだ   かけてくれ ドン・ヘンリーを グレン・フライを   カール・ウィルソンのためにも   かけてくれ 悲劇を トワイライト・タイムを   事件の現場へ連れてってくれ   かけてくれ そしてまた一人が命を落とす   かけてくれ Old Ragged Cross 神を我々は信じる   長く寂し死道を 頭が爆発するまで待って立って   彼らは列車に乗りそびれた   ミステリーも見逃した   その男は死んで見つかった 朽ちた木のように   牧師のために かけてくれ   かけてくれ オスカー・ピーターソンを スタン・ゲッツを   ブルー・スカイを ディッキー・ベッツ      かけてくれ アート・ペパー   セロニアス・モンク チャーリー・パーカー   そしてジャンクのすべて（all that junk）   そしてジャズのすべて（all that jazz)      アルカトラスのバードマン（birdman of Alcatraz)のために何か曲をかけてくれ   バスター・キートン ハロルド・ロイド   プリティ・ボーイ・フロイド      Cry Me A River をかけてくれ 神々のために   かけてくれ No. 9を No.6 を   リンジーとスティーヴィ・ニックスのために   かけてくれ ナット・キング・コールのNature Boy   1200万の魂が最後に失われる   かけてくれ Stella By Starlightを レディ・マクベスのために      心配するな 大統領閣下   助けは向かっている   あなたの兄弟がやってくる   兄弟？ どの兄弟だ？   この地獄はなんだ？   俺たちは待っていると告げてくれ   そして捕まえる      愛の畑でタッチダウンをする   でも立ち上がることはなかった   そのあとに続くのは大変だった   誰の二番目でもなく   彼らは殺した 昇る太陽の祭壇の上で      Mistyをかけてくれ Old Devil Moonを   Anything Goesを Memphis in Juneを   かけてくれ ジェリー・ロール・モートンを ルシールを   Key To The Highway、King of The Heart   かけてくれ Marching Thru Georgia   暗闇をかけてくれ 死をかけてくれ それが来た時は   愛をかけてくれ 血をかけてくれ   最も卑劣な殺人をかけてくれ      聞取りと訳：丸山京子   *原詞が無い中、短時間で聞き取ってその一部を翻訳したものです。この大作をいち早く理解する手助けになればと存じます。どうぞご了承ください。               ＜リリース情報＞      ボブ・ディラン   「マーダー・モスト・ファウル」   配信中   https://sonymusicjapan.lnk.to/BobDylan_MurderMostFoul

At 34 years old, Indiana baseball coach Jeff Mercer isn’t that far removed from his playing days. He was the Horizon League Player of the Year in 2009. That season, he hit .357 with 26 doubles.
 So when it comes to the question of what should happen for this year’s set of spring athletes — their seasons cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic — there’s little hesitation from the former Wright State first baseman, now in his second year as the Hoosiers’ head coach.
 “My personal opinion, I’d like to see all of the athletes receive an additional year of eligibility,” Mercer said. “I realize the ramifications. That makes it a very difficult process, and there are unintended consequences that carry on four or five years into the future. But … it just wasn’t that long ago I was playing, and to think about one of my years of eligibility taken away on something that was completely out of everyone’s control, obviously. And, undeniably, they made the right decision.

Sam Segran, chief information officer and vice president for IT at Tech, said the Tech IT Division was already working behind the scenes on tasks that would prepare the university for an all-online format.
 "A lot of the information that we have been working on for the last few years was already towards moving the core pieces to cloud-based services," he said. "So, [Microsoft Office 365] was already on the cloud, Blackboard was already hosted on the cloud."
 Adobe also was moved to the cloud, Segran said. The bandwidth to the university also was increased.
 "But that actually is just a back-up to make sure that we're OK, so we have pretty large bandwidth available," he said.
 As more applications are moved to the cloud and as people go online, Segran said the way data travels will change a little bit.
 "The data is not traveling on the university's bandwidth," he said. "It is going directly from a person's home or their personal device straight to [Microsoft Office 365] or to another cloud-based for Blackboard and things like that."
 Regardless, with multiple people using different online Tech resources, Segran said the systems should run smoothly.
 "We've got pretty robust information systems," he said.
 The Tech IT Division will continue to help faculty members transition to an online format, Segran said. For IT services and assistance, one should call 806-742-4357.
 In addition to reaching out for IT services, faculty may need instruction on how to conduct their courses.
 Micah Logan, associate director of the Tech Teaching, Learning and Professional Development Center, said the center's staff is working remotely to provide guidance to faculty on teaching an online course effectively.
 "For us, thinking about how are we providing that support," she said regarding the challenges people are facing with the transition to online classes.
 People have to rethink that way they do things, whether they be a student, professor or staffer. The TLPDC's main goal in the upcoming weeks is to listen to faculty and help them with their issues.
 "This is a big shift," she said. "In some ways, it's been really inspirational for those faculty, as they've been thinking outside of the box and finding new ways at looking at content," she said. "But it has also been a really big challenge for people who have never thought about testing in a different way or discussing in a different way."
 Every faculty member Logan has spoken to has been very busy trying to translate their classes to an online format, she said.
 For those in need of assistance, Logan said one can visit the TLPDC website and contact a staff member or can visit a web page where faculty can get advice from the Teaching Academy.

“We were going to return eight starters,” Mitchell said. “Obviously, Frontenac was going to be the team to beat, but we felt like we had a good shot this year. We had high hopes. Our seniors were all ready for their last hurrah, and it got jerked from them. I know they’re hurting.”
 In addition to Zoey Mitchell, other seniors are Camryn Compton, Danielle Weaver, Mia Moss, Jayden Phillips and Madison Strup. Compton will play collegiately at Wichita State, while Weaver is headed to Neosho County Community College to play basketball.
 This year’s seniors were freshmen when the Rams won the Class 3A state championship. As sophomores, the Rams went back to state again. Riverton suffered a one-run loss to eventual state champion Frontenac in last year’s regional final.
 “We were three outs away from beating the eventual champion,” Mitchell noted. “We thought we might get over the hump this year and get back to state and win another championship.”
 Now, all Mitchell and the Rams can do is wonder what might have been.
 “We’re trying to cope with everything that’s going on,” he said. “I know my daughter and her classmates are concerned about the other things that are in limbo at this point like graduation and prom. Prom is a big deal for the girls. It is what it is. It’s life. You have to deal with it and go on. And we all just to have to stay safe with our families.”

That contract did not appear on the council's docket for next week, since it was still in the process of being formalized.
 Gusciora, known for jumping the gun in the past, did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment and let his press flack take the fall for the COVID-19 gaffe.
 Ilchert was at a loss to explain how city officials overestimated the number of kits they had allegedly secured.
 If, and that appears to be a very big if, the test center reopens next week, it will likely do so under more stringent protocols.
 All Mercer County first responders who were symptomatic, traveled overseas or to New York or believed they came into contact with someone positive for the virus were eligible for testing.
 But that pool will likely have to be scaled back in the event the city lucks into more test kits.
 Many of Trenton's legislators, usually quick to slam the mayor, did not respond to phone calls seeking a reaction to the unexpected shuttering of the test center.
 At-large councilman Jerell Blakeley said now was not the time for "political posturing."
 "These are definitely trying times," he said. "Everyone wants test kits and there’s only so much to go around. The mayor and his team are going to have to figure out how to procure more test kits for our first responders."
 Meanwhile, West Ward councilwoman Robin Vaughn took to Facebook to blast Gusciora over the fact that Trenton doesn't have a test center for the public.
 She claimed that Gusciora was irresponsible and usurped council by "unilaterally" agreeing to have Trenton contribute funds to open a test center for the public at the Quakerbridge Mall in Lawrence.
 Mercer County Executive Brian Hughes couldn't be reached for comment to confirm as much.
 "How will our community members get to Lawrenceville," Vaughn mused. "They can't go by bus or cab or uber, if they feel the need to go get tested. ...Trentonians, this is not only concerning. It's appalling. Plain and simple, this decision puts the lives of Trentonians at risk."

The Rams also advanced to state during Compton’s sophomore year. Last year, the Rams missed out on state after falling 5-4 in the regional championship game to eventual state champion Frontenac.
 Compton also played basketball and volleyball at Riverton, and she earned all- CNC League honors in both sports.
 “It was a lot of fun,” Compton said of her prep career. “I’ll remember it forever. I have a lot of good memories that we all built together.”
 The daughter of Jim and Debbie Compton, Camryn followed in the footsteps of her older sisters Taylor and Jamee. Taylor plays softball at South Dakota State and Jamee is on the roster at Newman.
 Academically, Compton ranked first in her class with a 4.0 GPA. Compton plans to major in business and accounting at Wichita State.
 “Wichita State felt like home,” Compton said. “I’ll be close to home. My friends and family have backed me up during my career, and I know I’ll still have their support. I think playing at Wichita State is going to be a really fun experience.”
 Compton was heavily recruited before deciding on WSU.
 “Camryn Compton is a strong, powerful athlete that competes in three sports,” Wichita State head coach Kristi Bredbenner said in a press release after Compton signed with the Shockers last November. “Camryn's bat is explosive and she has the potential to be a record-setter at the plate for the Shockers."
 Compton noted she’s been missing everything that goes along with participating in a team sport—not only competing on the field, but also the quality time spent with her teammates and coaches.
 “We were a super close team, so it’s hard not being with my teammates,” Compton said. “We pushed each other every day. We won a state championship our freshman year, and we had winning a state title as our goal for our senior year. We worked really hard these past few years. It would have been really cool to go out with a bang. We would have at least liked to see what we could do.”

Nothing could stop him in those early years, as he set about redefining a sport. But as Bolt’s youth slipped away, so did his frightening advantage. By the time the 2015 World Championships arrived, dissenting voices had emerged – so too had a clear rival to the sport's golden boy: the reviled double drug cheat Justin Gatlin. For the first time in his career, Bolt was under fire from inside and outside his sport. A race which took on a moral dimension - almost becoming a parable of good versus evil - had everything riding on it, and Gatlin was in imperious form, unbeaten in 29 races.

“That’s life,” second-year IU coach Jeff Mercer said. “There are situations that you can’t control and things that don’t come to pass that you wish would have, but what we have to do is learn from what we were able to do and then apply to where we’re trying to go.”
 Highlights of the season included a 17-2 rout of rival Purdue and a 7-2 win at No. 11 LSU during a three-game series to open the season in February.
 “We had kids that worked tremendously hard, that were completely invested into helping the group succeed, that loved representing Indiana, and that were just everything that we want the program to represent,” Mercer said.
 Mercer said based on his knowledge, all of his players are healthy and safe back with their families. The next step, Mercer said, is to message all of his players and formulate an offseason workout plan based on NCAA guidelines. Mercer said baserunning and defense will be two points of emphasis for improvement for next season.
 “I don’t worry about those guys doing the work,” Mercer said. “That’s how they were raised, that’s how they were brought up and that’s the expectation. If you are going to come play at Indiana, the expectation is you are going to walk in with that level of work ethic and you are going to continue those things even in, I would obviously say, less than ideal circumstances.”
 Offensively, IU was paced by sophomore outfielder Grant Richardson, who batted .424 with five home runs and 17 RBI in 14 games.

As such, what COVID-19 is plainly teaching us is that companies, to combat this or really any unforeseen disruption to their supply chain, should move now to implement agile strategies that will make their supply chain more dynamic. Having the ability to quickly shift an order or load to another trading partner who can support it or to make rapid adjustments to their supplier base for more favorable pricing terms, are just some of the value- creation benefits of supply chain agility. Integration plays a key part in this equation. Integration strategies that are pieced together run the risk of faulty integrations that result in businesses not having the goods and materials on shelves to sell to people who might need them, which directly impacts the bottom line.

Like many other companies Disney is feeling the pinch of the entertainment lock down and has been relying heavily on whatever can be salvaged at this time as Disney+ is one of its big draws at the moment. With its amusement parks shut down, the studios unable to keep filming, and money pouring out of the Mouse House like a green river it's likely that the end of the pandemic, whenever it comes, is going to find Disney hurting just as much as anyone in the movie business, but at the very least the streaming network is a bright ray of hope at this time since it's still up and running and it's still drawing people in. Rich Duprey of The Motley Fool has more to say on this matter. But if anyone is thinking that this is the answer to the corporation's woes then they're being kind since Disney+ experienced a severe drop off in subscribers only a few months ago after the first season of The Mandalorian had aired, as people had admittedly been tuning in to see the new live action Star Wars show and not much else.

Rocco posted on Facebook before her death that she was sick and quarantined. Hamilton Township as of Friday afternoon had 19 known cases of COVID-19, none fatal.
 “There have been no reported COVID-19 related deaths in Hamilton,” the superintendent of schools said Friday via email.
 But the Washington Post this week reported that “there already is anecdotal evidence that many deaths that stem from COVID-19 are not being recorded as such. Doctors and nurses have told BuzzFeed News that deaths in the United States are not being correctly reported, in part because overwhelmed hospitals and a shortage of tests meant people died before it was determined whether they had contracted the virus.”
 If Jamie Rocco died of pneumonia, such a death raises red flags in this age of the novel or new coronavirus.
 About three months ago, a pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China, according to the World Health Organization, which first received reports of this mysterious illness Dec. 31, 2019. The WHO later branded the disease as COVID-19.
 Sheller, who developed a good friendship with the late Jamie Rocco, is not sure what had caused her death.
 “Another client of mine who is a nurse said it might have been pneumonia,” he said. “But neither of us really knows. If it was corona, that is extraordinarily sad.”
 “She had texted me on March 13 that she wasn’t feeling well and that her mother was worried,” Sheller added. “She died six days later. I don’t know what happened. But I do know that she hadn’t squared away her health insurance, so a part of me thinks that reluctance to see a doctor might have been because she didn’t have the wherewithal to pay out of pocket.”
 Embracing the path of recovery, “She had become a person she liked,” Sheller said of Jamie Rocco. “I avoid being friends with clients, but for her I made an exception. I’m sorry she is gone. It will be a long, long time before she fades from memory.”

“All of a sudden I had this huge heart for goats,” Leslie McHone said. “My friend had given me a goat calendar and from there I really wanted one.”
 She began researching Nigerian dwarf goats due to their reputation of being companion animals.
 “It’s what they give to people,” McHone said. “Goats are some of the funniest animals and it is hard to have a bad day ... they help with depression and anxiety.”
 To make the dream of having a goat farm a reality, Leslie and Bob McHone purchased a more than 100-year-old barn in Linville and 5 acres of land. Due to the age of the barn and the overall shape of it, the couple took on the project of renovating it to its original appearance.
 New flooring and a new roof were set in August 2019, and plans for the future of the barn are still in the works. Leslie McHone said the Harrisonburg Lowe’s donated cabinets and a sink to allow a kitchen to be built inside the barn. Doors have been donated by a handful of people to help with the project.
 “We hope to have a monthly paint night,” Leslie McHone said. “Little by little, it’s coming along.”
 One of the finished rooms serves as a gathering space for their fellowship group, Celebrate Freedom. Bob McHone provides the discussion for the group and there’s a free meal. Occasionally, one of the many barn cats will join in on the discussion to get some love.
 With their background as volunteers at Our Community Place, a nonprofit organization helping those facing homelessness and other adverse experiences, Leslie and Bob McHone wanted to be able to share their animals with the community.

All Blacks head coach Ian Foster says he will take a pay cut and players will follow suit as New Zealand Rugby cuts expenses while professional competitions are shuttered during the coronavirus outbreak. In a radio interview Saturday, Foster confirmed he and other coaches had agreed to substantial pay cuts as long as New Zealand Rugbys revenues are affected. He did not give a percentage figure.Our coaching group has definitely taken a big cut, Foster told radio Newstalk ZB. Its already been agreed to. With rugby, when theres no games theres no revenue and thats a tough thing. Theres been a lot of shaving of the programs and what its also come down to is cutting salaries. Thats happened for some and happening for others. Foster said he had spoken to several All Blacks players who accept their pay will be cut and are prepared to make that sacrifice while the southern hemisphere Super Rugby tournament is suspended. July test matches in New Zealand and Australia are also in doubt.Its a different sort of process for players but I know that theyre willing to go into that space too, he said. As we go through the next few days that will be finalized. Its a given, they understand that. Its just a matter of working it through so all the different levels of players are dealt with fairly. I havent had one player yet who doesnt know its going to happen or doesnt accept that its going to happen. Players and coaches in many professional sports around the world have already taken pay cuts while leagues are suspended. Foster said New Zealand rugby has been hard hit by the shutdown.Its a dire state when you cant play a game, he said. Were obviously in a high-cost, high-revenue industry and when the revenue dies youre left with high costs. So its a no-brainer. Theres going to be some pain. The head of the Australian Rugby League Commission, Peter Vlandys, said he expected on Monday to announce a rescue package for clubs and players during the coranavirus crisis. The National Rugby League is suspended indefinitely, putting clubs and the sport itself under extreme financial pressure. I will put a package to the commission on Monday morning and then hopefully make an announcement that afternoon that I think the players and the clubs will be happy with, Vlandys told the Sydney Morning Herald.Players in Australian rules footballs Australian Football League Friday agreed to take pay cuts after lengthy negotiations..

Jelly Bean Farm was just a perfect storm of necessary variables finally coming together. That and an urge to add some levity and surrealness to what was coming off a bit aggressive or overly serious at the time. It was also a time when so many amazing unreleased tracks by newer producers were landing in my lap. I’d be playing them out to Los Angeles crowds that were die-hard dubstep, techno or footwork fans and I’d watch dancefloors still go off when I’d drop these tracks. I really wanted to push the sound more over here and try to get those producers exposure any way that I could. At that same time I had been stalking a Berlin-based visual artist named Ilan Katin on instagram that I simply knew that he could create my imaginary escapist world the way it was destined to be. I reached out to him and pitched the project and when he agreed it all clicked in. I reached out the producers through socials and in some cases had my partner Nathan (Squane) introduce me to them. My longtime best friend and music soulmate Lom (Rees) was also on board to take a silent partner type role and to help me out with things my attention span doesn’t handle very well, like setting up accounting spreadsheets. He does also join in on the fun as well, after all it was the first ever Squane x Rees collab "Little Orphan Android" that initially sparked me to create a label.

What about the party conventions? As of now, the Democratic Party is planning to hold its convention July 13-16 in Milwaukee and the Republican Party intends to gather Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte. That’s the idea, at least — and perhaps by summer it will be safe to return to politics as usual. But what if it isn’t?
 Anyone who has been on the crowded, bustling floor of a major-party convention knows that even the most diabolical Bond villain could hardly design a more perfect environment to guarantee the spread of a dangerous pathogen. Attendees come from around the country and spend four days in the closest proximity, sitting cheek by jowl, squeezing past one another, glad-handing with other delegations, cheering and chanting and otherwise expelling whatever happens to be lurking in their respiratory tracts.
 Normally, that’s not a serious problem — some people might go home with colds that they end up passing on to family and friends. But this year? Seriously?
 And then sprint to November is supposed to begin. In a best-case scenario, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 may turn out to be seasonal, like influenza, and new infections could naturally decline during warm-weather months. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday he believes this may be the case. That means we might get a respite. But it also means, Fauci said, that we should prepare for a second wave of infection and transmission when the weather again turns cold.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control, flu season usually begins in October. If COVID-19 follows that schedule, that second wave would begin washing over the nation just before Election Day.
 We have to start imagining a presidential campaign without campaigning. Will there be rallies? Will “pressing the flesh” seem a dangerous bygone practice? Will the battle take place exclusively on television and online?
 It will be challenging to hold a legitimate national election in the shadow of COVID-19. The time to start planning how to do this is now.

HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - In the living room of her Foster Village house, special education teacher Nicola Nakama-Ching sits on the floor at a foldout table, staring at her laptop and cell phone.Like so many others in Hawaii’s workforce she’s now working at home.“We have scheduled meetings, virtual meetings," she said.“I have a constant text group message with my co-workers.”She’s taught in the public school system for 17 years but never under these separated circumstances. “It’s definitely different. I’m such a social person,” she said.Besides work responsibilities, Nakama-Ching is a single mom. Her son and daughter are also adjusting to being apart from classmates and friends.“I miss them a lot. I’m bored around here. There’s no one to talk to,” said her daughter, Alea."My son loves games so it's going to be interesting to get him on a schedule and get him off his Xbox," Nakama- Ching said.Census estimates show just 5% of us worked from home full-time in 2017. That’s skyrocketed under the state’s orders to shelter-in-place and maintain social distance because of the coronavirus.“I’ve been working from home for with my kids for about a year now off and on,” work strategist Kuulani Keohokalole said. She owns a consulting business called People Strategies Hawaii and has produced vlogs about remote work."You really want to create some sort of boundary between your work and personal time," she said. "That way when you leave your space you're either taking a break or you're leaving work."She said you should have a designated work area and a set schedule.For Nakama-Ching, home work is a big adjustment. She misses face-to- face interaction with her students.“I would love to get back to school, but the health and safety of my family and my students is more important,” she said. She knows she’ll be working from home at least through April but it may be longer.Copyright 2020 Hawaii News Now. All rights reserved.

 The U.S. is enacting an even larger and more encompassing bailout than the one I helped oversee as the special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008.
 That means Americans will once again have to grapple with the inherent unfairness of letting the government pick winners and losers, along with the potential for fraud and scandal that always accompanies the distribution of so much money in such a short time.
 I've been one of many critics of the policy failures of the previous bailout. But let's not forget that strong and effective oversight was one of the clear successes of the 2008 program -- or the painful lessons it taught.
 First, strings must be attached to funds handed out to businesses crippled by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, and vigorous independent oversight is necessary to ensure compliance with them. Otherwise there will be no way to achieve the policy goals that the bailout intends to accomplish.
 There was a startling absence of any such strictures in 2008-2009. When the Treasury Department provided hundreds of billions of dollars to U.S. banks, it said that doing so would restore lending and provide relief to struggling homeowners. But it then refused entreaties to establish conditions that would ensure such a result.
 It was only the transparency brought through oversight (including an audit by the special inspector general's office of the banks' uses of funds) that made it clear that the banks did just about everything with their bailout money other than increasing lending or helping homeowners.
 While care must be taken to make sure that any conditions are not so onerous or unrealistic that they defeat the purposes of the bailouts themselves, smart, narrowly tailored requirements will be the difference between failure and success.
 Second, although granting a certain amount of discretion to policymakers implementing the bailout is necessary to allow them to adapt to changing circumstances, giving them too wide a lane can lead to poorly thought-out decisions.
 Examples from the financial crisis identified by oversight bodies included backdoor bailouts conducted in secret and otherwise shielded from the taxpayers funding them.
 One of the worst lapses involved the bailout of American International Group's Financial Products division, in which the government used taxpayer money to secretly pay off the failing insurance company's Wall Street counterparties to the tune of tens of billions of dollars for securities worth less than half of what the government paid.
 Third, agencies will make significant mistakes as they roll out programs, and tight oversight will be needed to correct course given the reluctance in Washington to admit error.
 The Treasury's programs to fulfill TARP's mandate to help homeowners were an egregious example of how badly awry things can go. As originally implemented, they included policies that condoned predatory actions by the banks' mortgage- servicing arms that left many homeowners worse off as a result of participating in the programs.
 Without scathing reports from the oversight bodies and subsequent congressional hearings, those rampant abuses -- which Treasury had characterized as successes -- would have continued unabated.
 Similar revelations provoked by the oversight bodies helped reshape some poorly designed programs and kill others, avoiding what could have been hundreds of billions of dollars of losses. Without truly independent oversight arms, similar errors with potentially similarly devastating consequences will go unchecked.
 Fourth, Congress should create a dedicated inspector general to keep an eye on the various aspects of the bailouts. That's what it did in the previous crisis, recognizing that an overtaxed inspector general already in place couldn't possibly oversee such a massive bailout effectively.
 Three agencies were created to oversee the TARP program: the special inspector general, a congressional oversight panel and the Government Accountability Office.
 The special inspector general's office, an independent agency within the Treasury Department, was both an auditing body and a full-fledged law enforcement agency (think of a mini-FBI for the TARP program). It worked to ferret out and deter those who would seek to criminally profit off of a national crisis, and pushed Treasury to include anti-fraud provisions in its bailout programs to bring criminal efforts to the surface.
 These efforts worked. The combination of robust enforcement and effective tripwires resulted in more than 350 convictions (including bank chief executives and other senior officers), $11 billion recovered, and minuscule losses due to fraud for a program of its size and scope.
 It is imperative that the lessons from the recent past be repeated. Strong policy-driven conditions, an independent inspector general with primary jurisdiction and specified congressional oversight will go a long way toward doing so.

President Donald Trump has issued a Defence Production Act order to force General Motors to produce ventilators for coronavirus patients. Mr Trump said negotiations with General Motors had been productive, &ldquo;but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course&rdquo;.The president, who had previously been reluctant to use the act, said &ldquo;GM was wasting time&rdquo; and that his actions will help ensure the quick production of ventilators to help save American lives.GM has re-purposed its auto electronics plant in Kokomo, Indiana to make the machines.However experts say that no matter how many ventilators companies can crank out, it may not be enough to cover the entire need, and it may not come in time to help areas now being hit hard with critical virus cases.US hospitals currently have about 65,000 ventilators fully capable of treating severe coronavirus patients.But some estimates suggest around 960,000 people in the US will need to be on ventilators at one point or another during the crisis.In the most severe cases, the coronavirus damages healthy tissue in the lungs, making it hard for them to deliver oxygen to the blood.Pneumonia can develop, along with a more severe and potentially deadly condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can damage other organs.GM said Friday it could build 10,000 ventilators per month starting in April with potential to make even more.After Mr Trump invoked the act, GM said in a statement that it has been working around the clock for more than a week to build more ventilators.The president invoked the Defence Production Act soon after a series of tweets on Friday attacking GM and CEO Mary Barra.He also cajoled Ford to build ventilators fast. Ford responded that it is &ldquo;pulling out all the stops&rdquo;.It was a dramatic shift in tone from the night before, when the president told Fox News that pleas by hospitals for more ventilators are exaggerated.&ldquo;I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they&rsquo;re going to be,&rdquo; he said.I don&rsquo;t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,&rdquo; Mr Trump continued.&ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re going to major hospitals sometimes, they&rsquo;ll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;can we order 30,000 ventilators?&rsquo;&rdquo;New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been pleading for 30,000 more ventilators to handle an expected surge in critical virus patients during the next three weeks.US Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said her state is facing a critical need for ventilators.Michigan has gone from three coronavirus deaths a week ago to a total of 92 on Friday.&ldquo;I think we need to let the scientists and the doctors tell us what we need and not people without medical degrees or the background,&rdquo; she said.

Washington’s vote-by-mail system limits the contact voters have, compared with other places – think long lines at polling places in other states.
 As the governor's office considered the issue, some counties had already begun scheduling and spending funds for their elections, said Inslee chief of staff David Postman on Friday. Meanwhile, some local officials already have canceled their elections, meaning there won't be too many taking place.
 “Rather than postponing the special April elections, we are working with Secretary Wyman on what could be done to help auditors manage elections during the outbreak, for April and later in the year,” Postman wrote.
 Wyman on Friday afternoon said she was disappointed by the governor's decision but that her office will work with the counties to make sure they can take proper measures.
 "It's frustrating because the (county) auditors are just between a rock and a hard place," she said, adding later: "I'm disappointed."
 King County will not be participating in the April elections, according to the county's elections office. But some county officials remain concerned voters coming into elections offices or elections workers bunched together could spread COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

 “Last year I started feeling like I’m supposed to do this on a bigger level,” Wainwright said. “I feel like this platform is going to be wasted if I don’t take advantage of it, and so I led two groups, one through the Cardinals, and one a small group of eight guys from home, through the Bible. We had about 20 guys do it.
 “It was so empowering. It was so powerful to me, the accountability that came with leading those groups and having to make sure I was sending something every day.”
 By the end of the year, Wainwright felt he had to take the discussion to an even grander level. So Wainwright took his plan to Pastor David Yarborough at St. Simons Community Church and discussed leading the church congregation through the Bible in one year, quickly amassing a group of nearly 6,000 to join in the journey.
 Wainwright also promoted his mission through his twitter page resulting in another 16,000 engaging in the Word. Anyone can join at @walkingwwaino.
 Near the end of the nearly 40-minute stream, Watson asked each guest to give him one word to share with all the athletes and coaches around the world. Wainwright settled upon the word “encouraged,” based on his belied Christians are called on to be the light.
 “As believers, when we let Jesus completely infiltrate our body, and the Holy Spirit just takes over, we become that light for the world to see,” Wainwright said. “What they’re actually seeing is not us, they’re actually seeing Jesus. And in this time, where there’s a lot of negativity around, I feel like this is a great time that we can spend encouraging others to make us look different.
 “We’re not supposed to look the same as people who aren’t called into Jesus’ service. We’re not supposed to be the same as the people who don’t believe. We’re called to be different. We’re called to be a light, and in this time, when the chips are down, we’ve still got the big man. We’ve still got our Lord, Jesus. We’ve still got our Holy Spirit. We’ve still got God. We’ve still got a lot to be thankful for.”

BIRMINGHAM, AL (WBRC) – Jonathan Robinson has been the owner of Little Professor Book Shop for a little more than month and up until last week, isolation was good for business.“We had about 10-14 days of increased sales, they were up month-to-month,” said Robinson. He added, “Just people buying more books because they expected to be locked down in quarantine for a while.”He stopped letting customers inside his shop in Homewood last week and started doing curbside service, but after Governor Kay Ivey issued a statewide order closing non-essential businesses, he will have to come up with an alternative plan.“We have a website up and people can search our stock. We launched activity boxes for kids, those have been really popular for kids,” said Robinson.He added, “Something hopefully to keep the community engaged and our lights on inside even though our doors are locked.”There are no other options for the Martins, who own The Back Forty, an event venue in Chilton County.Cindy Martin and her husband opened in October and were completely booked through May.“We were actually booking into 2021,” said Mrs. Martin.She added, “Everything was smooth until the closures and we do have half-a- million-dollars’ worth of payments to make to somebody at some point, for furnishings, the building and the property so…”“It is going to be an economic catastrophe for us and lot of other small businesses, not just in the state of Alabama but worldwide.”Martin is hopeful that after the crisis is over, their customers will return.“I just hope and pray for everyone who is dealing with the crisis the way that we are, that their business will be back up and running and the economy will take a turn for the better and we will all able to come together in a year or six months and say, ‘Hey, we made it through this crisis, here we are and we are a testimony to everything works out.’”She and Robinson said they understand the need for these closures and think they will be able to manage through the duration of order, which is set to be lifted April 17.“Most business owners are just trying to throw the kitchen sink at this – so again, we can sort of hang in there for a month or six weeks, but if it starts to be two, three, four, six months, I think it will be detrimental to all of us,” said Robinson.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

Disaster fraud also arises with contractors and vendors, in which companies hired by federal agencies for cleanup and rebuilding try to tip the scales for more profit. Following the 2017 wildfires in California’s wine country, hauling companies that had won a $1.3 billion cleanup contract were paid by the ton of debris they moved. Homeowners began complaining that the haulers were digging up too much, even claiming they’d destroyed driveways, sidewalks and retaining walls in good condition.

 Eddie passed away Wednesday.
 Like many friends do, Eddie and I drifted apart after high school. Hanging out from time to time turned into phone calls every once in a blue moon.
 The last time I talked to Eddie was after Kobe Bryant’s death. I called to check on him, because we both loved Kobe. We talked for a few minutes — he’d gotten out his card collection to look at his Kobe Bryant rookie cards. I ended the conversation by letting him know that I loved him.
 He said, “I love you, too.”
 I already knew that though. I knew it the moment he threw me the ball in junior high.
 Rest in peace, Eddie.

Four in 10 of those new claims were from people in the restaurant or hospitality industries, the sector directly affected by the health board’s earlier ban. The new restrictions will likely spread the pain to a greater number of workers.
 Ivey has so far rejected the notion of a “shelter-in-place” order that would in essence keep everyone at home until the illness is under control. On Friday, Ivey said she stopped short of ordering shelter in place to strike a balance between public safety and the needs of the economy.
 “When a business closes down, it's very, very — almost impossible — to bring it back to life,” the governor said.
 Ivey said it’s too early to estimate how much the closures will add the state’s jobless numbers.
 The announcement likely left some business owners wondering whether they’ll be affected by the ban. Harris on Thursday said gun stores are not on the list of banned retail establishments — though “sporting goods stores” are on the list. The list includes “department stores” but doesn’t specify whether big box stores such as Wal-Mart, which serve as the main grocery store in some communities, would be affected.
 “Unlike other states, we are not trying to designate what is essential,” Ivey said. “Instead, we are trying to designate what is not essential. If it's not on the list, it's not closed.”
 Robert Downing said he’d likely keep his family’s store, Downing and Sons on Gurnee Avenue, open. The shop was once known as Downing’s General Store, but Downing doesn’t think it fits any classification in the closure order. The store sells fabric and garden supplies.
 “People are going to need seeds and plants,” Downing said. He said he’s seen a decline in business since the coronavirus crisis began. He said his customers are well aware of the need to maintain a proper distance.
 “It’s breaking my heart to close this store,” said Patricia Hancock, owner of Book Rack, a used bookstore on Quintard Avenue. Hancock, 75, was already planning to close her 43-year-old shop permanently later this spring, with a $1 per book closeout sale. She didn’t know about Ivey’s order until a reporter told her Friday afternoon. Now she’s not sure whether the closeout sale will happen.
 “What am I supposed to do with all this inventory if I can’t reopen?” she said. “Just put it all on the curb?”
 Ivey and Harris announced the new orders in a televised news conference without an in-person audience — a practice state officials have adopted, they say, because they want to model proper social distancing. They took questions from reporters in advance of the press conference, by email.
 In a Thursday night declaration, Ivey also issued orders allowing notaries and state agencies to conduct business electronically and authorizing cities and counties to allow police to issue summonses for misdemeanors in lieu of arrest.
 Ivey’s order states that “the conditions of jails inherently heighten the risk” of transmission of the disease.

There is tremendous popular support for showing kindness to these students. But the NCAA vote is not a slam dunk. After a recent analysis, USA Today estimated that giving an additional season just to spring-sports seniors could cost public schools in the Power Five conferences anywhere from $500,000 to $900,000. This at a time when the NCAA is reeling financially from the cancellation of March Madness and schools are expecting a decline in donations as the economy teeters.
 Anyway, it isn’t simply a matter of what’s allowed. Most of these seniors were forming their college exit strategies and preparing for life in the world beyond campus.
 “I’ve competed all four years — or 3½. Is it time for me to move on?” wondered Chew, who is on course to graduate in May with a degree in kinesiology and sports management, with a minor in business. “Being a catcher, my body takes a beating. Do I take into consideration my health, and do another year physically? Financial, obviously? Saint Mary’s is a very expensive institution.”
 Chew had been leaning against grad school, at least right away. Now she is considering a Master’s program at Saint Mary’s, partly for a chance to play softball again.
 “I can’t do anything about it until I get answers,” she said. “Hypothetically, if the stars aligned, I’d like to go back and play another year. But the stars don’t always align in life.”
 Rohrer is nearly finished with her criminal justice degree. She had only to knock out a couple of filler courses — a yoga class and an independent study program that involved squad-car ride-alongs. She planned to graduate in May and immediately enter the police academy. She had it all set up. Now it’s on hold.
 “My take on it is that my job will always be there. The workforce will always be there,” Rohrer said. “Of course I would take that next year and play. But at the same time, my parents are sitting over here telling me financially it’s not the right decision, especially with the virus taking a toll on the economy and things like that. It’s hard, because now I have to not only convince myself, I have to convince my family that it’s the right decision.”
 For now, these two former high school rivals and travel-ball teammates (“We competed for the lefty catcher position,” said Rohrer, who used to play behind the plate) are back in their old rooms at their parents’ houses.
 Rohrer has been playing board games with her mother and father, taking the dog for walks, working out on an exercise machine and “doing the dirty work” in the garden with her mom. It has been an especially hard transition for Chew, who prefers to hyper-schedule herself.
 “I was up at 7 (a.m.) and in bed by midnight every day,” she said. “Now I get up, and I go to class online, and I sit and do homework. That takes up like four hours of my day, and then I have another 10 to go. I think I’ve done three or four giant 500-piece puzzles. I started riding a bike to get some cardio in and go out and get some fresh air. Looking at jobs, see if that’s an option.”
 As it turns out, part of what is getting these two through the long hours is long-distance contact with their teammates. Their 2020 quests cut short, the athletes are finding that no one understands what they’re feeling more than the women who shared their softball diamonds the past four years.
 “I talk to those girls every single day, all day,” Chew said. “It doesn’t feel final yet. But it feels like there’s a gap between my former life and now. You never know, I might be back next year. But even so, it’s never gonna be the same team.”

PlayStation is reportedly telling developers that loading games on the PS5 should be as quick and intuitive as picking something to watch on Netflix.
 According to Kotaku's Jason Schreier (via _Resetera_), Sony has been designing the PS5 to appeal to gamers looking to play in shorter increments of time. "They want people to feel more inclined to play in short bursts rather than only wanting to turn on the console when they have a few hours to spare," Schreier wrote.
 Likewise, it sounds like Sony was inspired by the way Netflix makes loading content consistently fast. "One of the pitches [Sony has] been making to developers is 'playing a PS5 game should be as easy as Netflix.' They want to make players feel like they can load up the game immediately and know exactly how much time a given activity is going to take them," said Schreier.
 This is all corroborated by _recent messaging_ from Sony that you'll be able to "jump right into whatever you like." A new _PS5 patent_ suggests more specific applications, like being able to more quickly access different parts of a game. Our own Connor Sheridan uses _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare_ as an example, where you could potentially load from the latest mission in the campaign or matchmake in Warzone from the home screen.
  _If you're worried the PS5 might be delayed due to the spread of coronavirus, there's reason to be cautiously optimistic. Sony recently issued a statement that says the_ _ _PS5 launch is still on track (so far) despite coronavirus__ _._

HORNELL -- Over 100 trips later, the homes damaged by the November fire on Preston Avenue have been demolished and the debris hauled away.
 The City of Hornell Board of Public Works noted the effort at its March meeting. In total, Steuben County trucked away 107 10-wheeler loads of debris, totaling 1,087 tons.
 Once the demolition and cleanup was complete, Hornell DPW delivered gravel for filler where needed, leveling off the ground. The city is now waiting for spring weather, when it will bring in topsoil and seed the grounds.
 The area will become a greenspace for the time being. Property owners deeded the land to the city, which will be placing two new homes on the site in a partnership with BOCES.
 The closure of schools this spring may delay the timeline to place the first home. Students had been at work finishing off a new home for a vacant lot on Front Street.

Dear Dave,   In light of recent events in our country, do you have suggestions for things people should think about and plan for if they get laid off from their jobs?   Sam
 Dear Sam,   It's no secret that things are shutting down all across the world. If your workplace has closed its doors and isn't offering pay, then it's time to regroup and get some things in order. The thought of being without a paycheck can be overwhelming, but a little thought and planning can help you get through times like these.
 Start living on a budget, if you aren't doing so already. Making a monthly budget will show you exactly where your money is going. Without it, you can't use every dollar to its fullest potential, because you don't even know how much money you have to work with. Plus, your budget will show places where you can cut back and save money.
 If you don't have any income right now, make a budget based on the amount of money on hand. If you have $600 left to your name, budget out exactly where each of those dollars will go. It's time to squeeze every last penny out of what you've got. If you still have cash coming in from a spouse's job or some other source, then adjust your budget to reflect that. Maybe the two of you usually bring in a combined $5,000 a month. Adjust your budget to live off that one income for the time being.
 When the going gets tough, you need to focus on the things you really need to survive - food, utilities, shelter and transportation. I call these the Four Walls. If there's any money left over after you take care of the Four Walls, make a list of what else you need to pay, and tackle those in order of importance. Reach out to anyone you can't pay, and explain the situation. They might be able to work something out, but they can't help if they don't know. Be upfront with them, and pray for the best.
 When you're just trying to make it to another day, you don't need to pay extra on debt. Instead, focus on piling up cash. Once life gets back to normal and everything is okay, you can pick up where you left off with your debt snowball. If it's within your budget to keep making minimum payments on your debt, go for it. But the Four Walls come first. This is also the time to sell anything and everything you don't need to make some extra cash.
 With so much being shut down right now, there might not be as many traditional ways to make extra money. So, look into driving for Amazon, delivering takeout food or dropping off grocery orders. Even if one of those doesn't work out, you can still take up odd jobs around your neighborhood. Be on the lookout for opportunities that will add a few extra bucks to your pocket. Don't forget to cut back on unnecessary expenses, either. Stop or pause your subscriptions. Call your cable, internet and cellular providers to see if there's anything they'll do to work with you.
 Finally, in times of real need, don't be too proud to ask for a helping hand. Many churches and community groups in your area exist for situations just like this.
 God bless you all!   Dave

There's a growing national trend of people decorating their yards to distract from coronavirus restrictions. Pocatello resident Veronica Alvarez is one of those home owners getting in on the action. She was inspired after driving around and seeing other houses lit up. She says it's a good way to brighten up community's spirits until this is all over.
 "You know, the things that are going on, it's terrible and Christmas lights always make people happy,” says Veronica, “that's what I think anyway. They make me happy so spread a little cheer."
 Even before Idaho Governor Brad Little signed his stay at home order, local restaurants were feeling the impact made by the coronavirus pandemic. Some moved strictly to carry out orders while others had to close for the time being. Uncle Jim's in Pocatello is currently closed, but decided to help out the local homeless shelter, Aid for Friends, before closing the doors.
 BJ Stensland with Aid for Friends says, "And they've donated their additional food that was in their cooler. So we were able to go over there and get eggs and bread and vegetables. But that's what we're going to continue to need."

I always want to establish friendships and long-term relationships in business and in life. So, the answer is very much yes - but in an open-minded and open- ended way. Maybe in a naive way when I began the compilation, I was expecting that more producers would be on board longer-term. But, I didn’t think about it too far ahead as I was always repeating the mantra “one foot in front of the other, Ganesa, one step at a time!” I like looking back at how it’s all unfolded very naturally. Sometimes producers move on and toward a new direction creatively or they level-up and want to release on a bigger label which is to be expected and I love to see it. Also, my tastes and creative direction for the label are steadily shifting as well. All of this is to be expected and is an exciting part of the process.

The US Naval Institute also reports that the Marines could operate HIMARS and other systems including Harpoon missiles against both land and sea targets. A key advantage is that the Marines could lead strikes on medium-distance targets without the need to employ fighter aircraft, which may not always be available or will have other high priority missions, especially establishing and maintaining air superiority.
 An interesting sidelight to the changes taking place in the Marines, is a decision in the works to reduce the number of F-35B and F-35C stealth fighters per squadron from 16 to 10, reflecting less need to rely on jet fighters if the Marines can carry out their mission with long range precision rocket artillery. Among other things this means smaller squadron sizes on Okinawa.

Like many governmental offices, the Monterey County Elections Department is closed to walk-in traffic and non-essential tasks.
 But employees were able to continue going to work last week as Monterey County's shelter-at-home order took effect in order to certify the results of the March 3 primary election.
 Two candidates for Monterey County supervisor—Luis Alejo in District 1 and Mary Adams in District 5—ran unopposed, and were re-elected with 6,754 votes and 25,728 votes, respectively.
 In the race for District 4, currently occupied by Supervisor Jane Parker, who is retiring, the original margins from Election Day held even as final ballots were tallied. Wendy Root Askew led the four-way race with 45.6 percent of the vote; Steve McShane came in second with 35 percent of the vote. As the top two in the primary, Askew and McShane will face off again in November. Third- and fourth-place finishers Alex Miller and Wini Chambliss are out of the running.
 Local school bonds had mixed results, though the results improved for schools since early returns on Election Day.

The U.S. is enacting an even larger and more encompassing bailout than the one I helped oversee as the special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008.
   
 That means Americans will once again have to grapple with the inherent unfairness of letting the government pick winners and losers, along with the potential for fraud and scandal that always accompanies the distribution of so much money in such a short time.
   
 I've been one of many critics of the policy failures of the previous bailout. But let's not forget that strong and effective oversight was one of the clear successes of the 2008 program -- or the painful lessons it taught.
   
 First, strings must be attached to funds handed out to businesses crippled by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, and vigorous independent oversight is necessary to ensure compliance with them. Otherwise there will be no way to achieve the policy goals that the bailout intends to accomplish.
   
 There was a startling absence of any such strictures in 2008-2009. When the Treasury Department provided hundreds of billions of dollars to U.S. banks, it said that doing so would restore lending and provide relief to struggling homeowners. But it then refused entreaties to establish conditions that would ensure such a result.
   
 It was only the transparency brought through oversight (including an audit by the special inspector general's office of the banks' uses of funds) that made it clear that the banks did just about everything with their bailout money other than increasing lending or helping homeowners.
   
 While care must be taken to make sure that any conditions are not so onerous or unrealistic that they defeat the purposes of the bailouts themselves, smart, narrowly tailored requirements will be the difference between failure and success.
   
 Second, although granting a certain amount of discretion to policymakers implementing the bailout is necessary to allow them to adapt to changing circumstances, giving them too wide a lane can lead to poorly thought-out decisions.
   
 Examples from the financial crisis identified by oversight bodies included backdoor bailouts conducted in secret and otherwise shielded from the taxpayers funding them.
   
 One of the worst lapses involved the bailout of American International Group's Financial Products division, in which the government used taxpayer money to secretly pay off the failing insurance company's Wall Street counterparties to the tune of tens of billions of dollars for securities worth less than half of what the government paid.
   
 Third, agencies will make significant mistakes as they roll out programs, and tight oversight will be needed to correct course given the reluctance in Washington to admit error.
   
 The Treasury's programs to fulfill TARP's mandate to help homeowners were an egregious example of how badly awry things can go. As originally implemented, they included policies that condoned predatory actions by the banks' mortgage- servicing arms that left many homeowners worse off as a result of participating in the programs.
   
 Without scathing reports from the oversight bodies and subsequent congressional hearings, those rampant abuses -- which Treasury had characterized as successes -- would have continued unabated.
   
 Similar revelations provoked by the oversight bodies helped reshape some poorly designed programs and kill others, avoiding what could have been hundreds of billions of dollars of losses. Without truly independent oversight arms, similar errors with potentially similarly devastating consequences will go unchecked.
   
 Fourth, Congress should create a dedicated inspector general to keep an eye on the various aspects of the bailouts. That's what it did in the previous crisis, recognizing that an overtaxed inspector general already in place couldn't possibly oversee such a massive bailout effectively.
   
 Three agencies were created to oversee the TARP program: the special inspector general, a congressional oversight panel and the Government Accountability Office.
   
 The special inspector general's office, an independent agency within the Treasury Department, was both an auditing body and a full-fledged law enforcement agency (think of a mini-FBI for the TARP program). It worked to ferret out and deter those who would seek to criminally profit off of a national crisis, and pushed Treasury to include anti-fraud provisions in its bailout programs to bring criminal efforts to the surface.
   
 These efforts worked. The combination of robust enforcement and effective tripwires resulted in more than 350 convictions (including bank chief executives and other senior officers), $11 billion recovered, and minuscule losses due to fraud for a program of its size and scope.
   
 It is imperative that the lessons from the recent past be repeated. Strong policy-driven conditions, an independent inspector general with primary jurisdiction and specified congressional oversight will go a long way toward doing so.
   
 Neil Barofsky was the special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program from 2008 to 2011.

 Southpark Mall, like many other area businesses, has entered into a coronavirus-induced slumber. But unlike many of those other area businesses, people are too quick to throw dirt on the mall as it sleeps and give it up for dead.
   
 Why? Why are you ready to perform last rites over the shopping center? Why are you already envisioning something else to go there?
   
 Why aren't you as quick to pass judgment on some of the other businesses that have been forced into hibernation or semi-hibernation?
   
 Big Bad Amazon did not huff and puff and blow the mall down. Nor did any economic downturn.
   
 Southpark Mall closed for one simple reason: The governor essentially told it to close.
   
 Gov. Ralph Northam deemed all up-close-and-personal businesses -- grooming services, entertainment venues, fitness centers -- to close. He also said others who offer non-essential services and cannot maintain more than 10 people in the business at a given time should shutter.
   
 Some may consider mall stores to provide essential services. But under an emergency declaration, retail therapy and jingle in the coffers are not seen as a necessity.
   
 Besides, so many retailers inside Southpark, including its five anchor tenants, already had voluntarily closed as a public service to fight the pandemic. Mind you, they did not go out of business because the internet is open 24/7.
   
 Plus, the public's growing concern over moving out and about was keeping many people tucked away safe and sound in their homes.
   
 Will all those stores dark, Southpark was wasting valuable time, money and electricity keeping its doors open. Noble intentions notwithstanding, mall management did the right thing by taking a break.
   
 We were bothered by some of the comments we saw on our social media about Southpark shutting down because of the pandemic. Some of you don't expect it to reopen. Others said good riddance because they felt the mall had become some kind of societal trash dump. It was almost as if they were wishing it away.
   
 Come on, folks. You're better than that.
   
 Southpark Mall is what it is, just like all the other shopping centers around the world. Yes, brick-and-mortar businesses have been pinched hard by Big Bad Amazon and its web counterparts. But show us a traditional business that has not. Lord knows if you are reading this in a traditional print form, you are bearing first witness to an industry hit hard by cyberspace.
   
 However, traditional business has adapted to the changed retail climate, marrying online to inline. Southpark Mall has been around since 1989, bringing millions and millions of dollars into the Tri-City area economies. It easily could have turned its back to the coming online storm and hoped the damage would not be too life-threatening. But it didn't.
   
 Coronavirus pressed the pause button on business. Shoot, it pressed the pause button on life as we know it. However, as we all know, pause is not permanent. Everyone, Southpark Mall included, will emerge from this and hopefully be better for it.
   
 So, please do not toll the funeral bells for such an important contributor to our economy. The only bells we should be listening for are on the alarm clocks waking the area -- all of it -- to a new day.

PAINTED POST | The Corning-Painted Post School District is seeking an extension of the deadline for residents to pay school taxes, with a letter recently sent to Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
   
 "A number of taxpayers have contacted my office, expressing concern that they may not be able to pay their taxes on time as a result of the financial impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic," Superintendent Mike Ginalski wrote in the letter, which was sent at the direction of the Board of Education.
   
 The extension, if granted, would mean residents could pay taxes normally due March 31 as late as April 21 "without interest or penalty."
   
 Ginalski, in a written statement to the press, said he wishes they could provide residents with a longer extension on their tax bill.
   
 "We are in an unprecedented situation and I commend the Board for taking this action," he said. "While we recognize that 21 more days is not much of an extension, it's the only option we have per Real Property Tax Law. If we had the ability to create our own Executive Order, the date for payment would have been pushed well beyond April. Unfortunately that's not an option."
   
 District officials referenced state law that says: "during a state disaster emergency as defined by Executive Order issued upon a request from the Chief Executive Officer of a county, city, town, village or school district in the affected area, to extend up to 21 days the final date for payment of taxes without interest or penalty in such county, city, town, village or school district."
   
 Board of Education President Dr. Dale Wexell said district leadership is aware of how difficult the current situation is for many families -- because they are living through this as well.
   
 He also noted that the board may look for other options if the governor doesn't act on the requested extension.
   
 "In light of the COVID-19 emergency and the financial challenges facing so many families, the Board of Education -- with limited options to deal with school tax -- fully supports the request letter to defer any unpaid tax penalty for 21 days," Wexell said in a written statement. "The Board is also looking at other potential options in the event that the Governor does not act. We are all in this together."

Insistently optimistic, President Donald Trump said of the greatest public- health emergency in anyone’s lifetime, “I don’t think its going to end up being such a rough patch” and anticipated the economy soaring “like a rocket ship” when it’s over. Yet he implored Congress late in the day to move on critical aid without further delay.
 The package is intended as relief for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that’s killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said: “We’ve anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won’t need this for three months.”
 Underscoring the effort’s sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget.
 But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators from states who economies are dominated by low-wage jobs demanded changes, saying the legislation as written might give workers like store clerks incentives to stay on unemployment instead of returning return to their jobs since they may earn more money if they’re laid off than if they’re working. They settled for a futile vote to modify the provision, with a final vote to immediately follow.
 Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said, “I’m telling you, these numbers don’t work.”
 Ardent liberals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were restless as well, but top Washington Democrats assured them that a fourth coronavirus bill will follow this spring and signaled that delaying the pending measure would be foolish. The sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid.
 House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., swung behind the bipartisan agreement, saying it “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people.”
 Working in tandem after days of feuding, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Democrat Chuck Schumer pressed for passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate by the end of the day.
 Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic- controlled House on Friday. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber was unclear.
 House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for Trump’s signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington.
 The package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.
 One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well.
 Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress’ top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure is not an option, nor is starting over, which permitted both sides to include their priorities.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - Tennessee prisoners who have been granted parole may not go home during the COVID-19 pandemic because of access to classes they need to take before leaving prison.Nearly 1,600 Tennessee inmates are sitting in prison right now have been granted parole.Nashville attorney David Raybin wants them to be released now.“I think it’s inhuman to keep people in prison under this circumstance,” Raybin said. “These people have been vetted by the parole board, they’ve been in there a long time, they are going to get out eventually anyway so all I’m asking is accelerate this process in light of this emergency.”Before an inmate can be released and report for parole, they must complete a pre-parole program while still in prison. Many classes are being held only at specific facilities or have been reduced to comply with social distancing.“I’m not advocating they open the doors and let everybody out. These folks have already been granted parole,” said Raybin. “They are waiting for a program that no longer exists.”Raybin and the Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers sent this letter to the Tennessee Board of Parole and to Governor Bill Lee asking these inmates for their safety.“The more people you have in a confined environment, the greater the chances are that there could be an epidemic in a prison,” said Raybin.The Investigators reached out to the Tennessee Board of Parole which said it has "already started to identify candidates who have been granted release but may not be able to complete their required pre-release conditions through no fault of their own.“Raybin hopes the inmates won’t have to wait long.Copyright 2020 WMC.

_Brasilia, 27 mar 23:23 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il governo brasiliano ha annunciato oggi l'apertura di una linea di credito speciale da 20 miliardi di real (3,6 miliardi di euro) destinata a piccole e medie imprese. La misura fa parte del complesso delle azioni messe in campo dall'esecutivo di Brasilia per contrastare la crisi economica causata dalla diffusione del coronavirus. La misura prevede il finanziamento a tasso agevolato per le imprese per coprire il corso del pagamento di due salari per i lavoratori. La società che accede al credito, in cambio, non potrà licenziare il dipendente per due mesi. La misura è stata pensata per evitare di aumentare i costi per le imprese che hanno bloccato le produzioni a causa delle restrizioni imposte ai lavoratori, e perché queste evitino di licenziare i dipendenti creando un effetto negativo sull'economia.

Even before Governor Little signed his "Stay-at-Home" order local restaurants were feeling the impact made by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
 Some eateries moved strictly to carry-out orders while others had to close for the time being.
 Uncle Jim's Family Dining in Pocatello is currently closed, but the restaurant helped out the local homeless shelter, Aid for Friends, before closing its doors to the public.
 Aid for Friends Executive Director B.J. Stensland says, "And they've donated their additional food that was in their cooler. So, we were able to go over there and get eggs, and bread and vegetables. But, that's what we're going to continue to need."
 During the pandemic the shelter is in need of hand sanitizer, alcohol swabs and food. Donations can be dropped of at the shelter's administration offices at 210 E Center St. Pocatello, ID 83201.

The company is still firing on most of its cylinders; otherwise, they wouldn’t announce that they are giving every employee $1,000 to help them through the virus crisis. Management is calm in the face of adversity and investors should follow suit. In a few months, Facebook will go back to being a lucrative cash machine. I have no doubt that if the stock market is higher in the future, FB stock will be leading it. There will be technical resistance at $160 and $170 per share, but eventually the bulls will be able to clear them as the stock is now in stronger hands. Just like forests need fires to create fresh growth, stocks that rally too fast need corrections to transfer ownership into investors with stronger conviction.

RNBWS and I had been exchanging music and little chats on socials for quite some time and I have really loved every single track I’ve heard by him. After years of this I wondered why I hadn’t reached out to him yet to ask if he’d be interested in doing a release. I did and lucky for me he was into it. After sending over music we agreed on a set. Most of the time before a release I communicate with a producer to get a sense of what their EP means to them. This helps me with art direction and what I relay to ilan. It wasn’t until that stage with Maxim I was let in on his inspiration so I conveyed it the best I could through the Jelly Bean Farm lens. I’m not sure Jelly Bean Farm is the project for explicit messages of any type really. I don’t have anything against relaying political messages in the slightest, as politics is always there shaping our lives. It’s just that once anything goes through the Jelly Bean Filter filter it gets abstracted and ends up symbolic in the end. That could change in the future, but as it stands the nature of this label mirrors the music and for me that is about deconstructing, twisting and mashing up inspirations old and new for each person that happens to come across it to perceive in their way.

Monterey County schools were ahead of the curve when it came to flattening the curve.
 The superintendents of all 24 K-12 public school districts jointly announced on March 13 that they would close school for at least the remainder of the month of March—that was before there was a single confirmed case in Monterey County and before Monterey County Health Officer Edward Moreno issued a shelter-in-place order.
 On Thursday, March 26, the Monterey County Office of Education announced that schools will be closed for at least another month, and the earliest possible reopening date is now May 4.
 "With more and more confirmed cases in our county, our state and our nation, now more than ever, it is important communities in Monterey County heed the stay-at-home/shelter-in-place orders to prevent further spread of Covid-19," according to MCOE's statement.
 It's important to note that each district makes its own local choice; all 24 superintendents again have agreed to coordinate and work together on a joint announcement.
 “Schools play a vital role in our communities and balancing that role with the need for keeping our Monterey County residents safe and socially distanced is essential at this time when we have evidence of community transmission in Monterey County,” Moreno said in MCOE's statement.
 During the closures, many school cafeterias are still offering meals for students to pick up. Thanks to a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued on March 25, students themselves no longer need to be present to pick up meals per normal USDA school lunch regulations; parents or guardians may now pick up meals on the kids' behalf.

Their argument is that "the enclosed nature" of jails and difficulties in maintaining sanitary conditions and the recommended social distance within such confined spaces make jails and prisons "perfect breeding grounds" for the virus.
 The issue drew additional attention this week when the Missouri State Public Defenders Office sent a letter to the Missouri Supreme Court requesting an order that the lower courts begin releasing certain categories of inmates from jails because of the pandemic. The letter in particular sought the release of those serving sentences for municipal violations and misdemeanors; those being held pretrial on municipal violations, misdemeanors and nonviolent Class C, D and E felonies; those awaiting probation violation hearings; and inmates in high-risk COVID-19 categories for serious illness or death.
 "Those who will be affected by COVID-19 inevitably entering into Missouri's city and county jails include not only inmates but corrections workers, health care workers, police officers, judicial department employees, attorneys and the families of many of these people," the letter read.
 The Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys countered with a letter of opposition to any "sweeping order" releasing inmates "without considering individual factors that are essential to any fair and just decision."
 "Local authorities, such as sheriffs and judges, after input from prosecutors and defense attorneys, are in the best position to review and make decisions about the release of any individual inmate," the prosecuting attorneys association said in a news release.
 The state's high court has not acted on the matter as yet.
 Beth Riggert, communications counsel for the court, said: "I have no way to predict when or how the court might respond to any particular request, but as with all matters pertaining to the coronavirus pandemic, the court will take whatever further actions it deems appropriate under all circumstances."
 "I don't know that I agree with releasing prisoners in light of (the pandemic)," Jasper County Sheriff Randee Kaiser told the Globe.
 Kaiser said some municipalities in the county already are letting lesser offenders go rather than put them in jail. But with the various measures put in place since the start of the COVID-19 threat in the U.S., Kaiser thinks the risk to inmates at the Jasper County Jail is probably not any greater than the general populace assumes when they make a trip to the grocery store.
 The jail — currently operating slightly over capacity at about 190 inmates — is not allowing any outside visitors other than probation and parole officers and attorneys. Jail vendors are being met at the loading dock and not allowed inside. New inmates are screened for symptoms and placed in segregation for 48 hours, after which they face a second screening before being put in with the general population.
 "Anybody who displays any kind of symptoms gets quarantined immediately," Kaiser said.
 Jail staff members also are being screened and their temperatures taken when they come to work. He said there have been some who have shown up with allergies and other minor ailments and have been asked to stay home out of an abundance of caution.

OLYMPIA – Gov. Jay Inslee's office will let Washington's April 28 special election proceed despite worries among county election officials about safely administering and counting ballots during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Those concerns earlier this month led Secretary of State Kim Wyman and Washington’s county auditors to write a letter to Inslee requesting the election be canceled.
 The April elections are not considered a high-profile affair. Only 18 of Washington’s counties are scheduled to have issues on the ballot. Those elections don’t involve any candidates running for office, but present proposed bonds and levies to voters.

Sixteen months after Mary Barra angered Donald Trump by announcing plans to close several U.S. factories in states the president vowed to revive, the General Motors Co. CEO is back on the outs with the White House.Unlike in late 2018, Trump’s Friday fracas over ventilators caught GM completely off guard, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump first went on a Twitter tirade, accusing the company of taking too long to make the desperately needed medical devices and of trying to gouge the government. By the evening, he dredged up an old grudge, taking another shot at the automaker for closing a car factory in Ohio.Executives at GM -- which had worked around the clock for a week to convert an Indiana parts plant into a breathing-machine factory -- were themselves frustrated over how long it was taking the federal government to finalize terms with its partner Ventec Life Systems Inc., said people familiar with the private deliberations. GM forged ahead and detailed the ventilator deal in a midday statement that didn’t refer to Trump but disputed him by saying it would be “contributing its resources at cost.”Trump followed up his angry tweets hours later with an order that GM accept a federal contract that the company and Ventec had been seeking all along. His missives marked another set of twists and turns in what has been a tumultuous relationship between one of America’s most prominent companies and a president who prides himself on an ability to work with the private sector.Patching things up with the White House will be crucial for a company that is struggling to cope with its plants having to idle amid the coronavirus pandemic. The company is freezing work on new-vehicle programs, deferring pay for white-collar staff and piling up cash to weather a global health crisis and the economic fallout expected to follow for months to come.“The entire GM team is proud to support this initiative,” the company said in response to Trump’s order. “Our commitment to build Ventec’s high-quality critical care ventilator, VOCSN, has never wavered.”Reminiscent Run-InFor Barra, 58, the run-in with Trump is reminiscent of attacks the president waged after she went public in November 2018 with plans to close plants in Michigan, Ohio and elsewhere. Within hours of the announcement, Trump told reporters he had a conversation with Barra. Describing himself as “very tough” with the CEO, he told her “you better get back in,” referring specifically to GM’s plant in Lordstown, Ohio.The next day, Trump claimed his administration was looking into cutting all government subsidies the company received, including for electric cars. He didn’t follow through on the threat.In March 2019, Trump tweeted that GM needed to reopen the Lordstown plant or sell it to a new owner. The next day, he told followers he’d just spoken with Barra and claimed she blamed the United Auto Workers union for supposed intransigence. The next day, he urged the company and union to have talks on the plant immediately rather than when they were scheduled to negotiate a new labor deal in the fall.Barra had a breakthrough in May, when she gave Trump a heads-up that GM was working on a deal to sell the Lordstown factory to a maker of electric pickups. Trump tweeted “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” and thanked “Mary B.” His posts preempted GM’s press release about the still-preliminary discussions by more than an hour.Taking Trump’s SideIn October, GM sided with the Trump administration’s in the legal fight he’d been having with California over the future of fuel economy rules.When other automakers were trying to arrange a compromise side deal with California, they purposely avoided broaching the idea with GM, the Wall Street Journal later reported. The group was worried GM was meeting with the administration and would try to derail their effort, the newspaper said, citing Mary Nichols, the head of California’s Air Resources Board.The same month, GM ended a painful and costly 40-day strike by reaching a deal with the UAW that saved a plant in Michigan the company had planned to close, though not the one in Ohio.Still, the company committed to investing $7.7 billion in U.S. facilities and creating or retaining 9,000 jobs as part of the four-year contract.“General Motors gave us a little hard time with one building, wasn’t happy about that,” Trump said at a December rally in Battle Creek, Michigan. “It was the only building I had a problem with in the whole car industry. Right? Alright, you know the one I’m talking about. I didn’t like that. Anyway, but they’re spending money, you know, what can I tell you.”‘Patriotic’ OfferBy March, as the Trump administration was responding to the coronavirus pandemic, Barra again had a private conversation with the White House, this time telling top economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the company was willing to call back workers to idled plants and try converting them to build ventilators.Kudlow alluded to the conversation during a March 18 interview on Fox News. He praised Barra’s offer to reporters afterward, saying it was made “on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons.”On March 20, GM announced its collaboration with Ventec. In the week since then, when Trump and other officials in his administration were asked why they hadn’t invoked the Cold War-era Defense Production Act and compelled manufacturers to make ventilators, they said companies including GM were already stepping up.‘Extremely Unhappy’That stance changed in dramatic fashion on Friday. Trump referred to “Mary B” again on Twitter, though this time he said it was “always a mess” working with her.During an evening press conference in the White House briefing room, he criticized GM anew for closing the plant in Ohio, which is now owned by Lordstown Motors Corp.“I was extremely unhappy with Lordstown, Ohio, when they left Lordstown, Ohio,” Trump said of GM. “Frankly, I think that would be a good place to build the ventilators, but we’ll see, we’ll see how that all works out.”GM’s wheels were in motion to make ventilators before Trump’s order, and the federal government isn’t going to make the company move any faster than it was already, said Kristin Dziczek, the vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.“Mary seems pretty unflappable, and she’s going to do what’s the right thing to do,” Dziczek said by phone. “She’ll just keep on keeping on and hope to receive some degree of clarity about what it is the customer wants, which is the federal government.”

 HORNELL -- Over 100 trips later, the homes damaged by the November fire on Preston Avenue have been demolished and the debris hauled away.
 The City of Hornell Board of Public Works noted the effort at its March meeting. In total, Steuben County trucked away 107 10-wheeler loads of debris, totaling 1,087 tons.
 Once the demolition and cleanup was complete, Hornell DPW delivered gravel for filler where needed, leveling off the ground. The city is now waiting for spring weather, when it will bring in topsoil and seed the grounds.
 The area will become a greenspace for the time being. Property owners deeded the land to the city, which will be placing two new homes on the site in a partnership with BOCES.
 The closure of schools this spring may delay the timeline to place the first home. Students had been at work finishing off a new home for a vacant lot on Front Street.

“The vast majority of people do not need more toilet paper per day in the coming weeks than in the past,” he said.
 While there may not be as much of it on the shelves, that’s just because people decided to stock up. There is no danger of a shortage. Nearly all the toilet paper sold in U.S. stores is produced domestically. Unlike certain products, such as cranberries, it is not seasonal. And it’s easy to make.
 It’s a similar story for many of the items sold in grocery stores. There is more flour, canned beans and bacon sitting in distribution centers. They’re just missing from shelves because of an unexpected spike in demand.
 So what should people do if a particular product they’re looking for isn’t on the shelf when they go to the store?
 “All I can say is just wait,” Tatikonda said.
 Unfortunately, there are other items in short supply that people cannot wait for in this pandemic. Health care workers in cities across the country do not have enough protective equipment. Manufacturers can’t keep up with the soaring global demand for ventilators. And most hospitals don’t have a lot of extra space to handle a surge in patients who need to be isolated.
 “This is the biggest problem,” Tatikonda said.
 The American health care systems is generally set up to not have too many empty beds or unused equipment in hospitals. It’s considered a waste, Tatikonda said.

“That’s why you see the (transfer) portal the way it is, a lack of patience in realizing that it’s not always better and different somewhere else. Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not. Sometimes they just need to get their rear end in the gym, buy into the staff and program.”
 That’s where Moren says she appreciates the advice her parents gave her any time she called home complaining.
 “They said, ‘You’re not quitting and you’re not coming home, so figure it out,’” Moren recalled. “There’s a stick-to-it-iveness you have to have when things aren’t going your way. It’s not always going to go the way you want it to.”
 But Moren is optimistic about her squad’s direction.
 “I like our group, and I think our freshmen will improve and get better with the right mindset,” Moren said. “All of them want to play but at the end of the day, there are only 200 minutes and it’s tough to believe they’re all going to be happy.”
 That said, Indiana has had its fair share of success mining the transfer portal with the likes of Patberg and Wise, and the hope is that Danielle Patterson can be the next in line.
 The 6-2 Notre Dame transfer underwent knee surgery for a patella injury last summer and hopes to be cleared for running by June. That means shooting has been the extent of her basketball activity.
 “We talk about Brenna departing and moving on. I do see Dani Patterson as being one of those kids who could slip into the role of being a leader,” Moren said. “She had a great temperament and a great pulse on our team as individuals. Just watching her in practice, watching her walk around and talk and communicate with teammates was very special. She stayed very engaged. She’s a talented kid but to say we know how she’s going to come back is still too early.
 “She’s been progressing slowly, her spirit’s been great, a wonderful kid who can shoot the ball. She has been able to do light shooting, so we know we have a kid who could stretch the defense like Brenna. The plan before surgery was to improve her ballhandling, just build her game and grow her game. Disappointed we didn’t get that opportunity, but she’s chomping at the bit. This has tested her patience because she loves the game. We’re excited about her but it’s hard to say we know exactly what we have to look forward to. We won’t know that until she gets go ahead.”
 With Bendu Yeaney and Shaila Beeler transferring out of the program this year, the Hoosiers now have multiple open scholarships if they find someone else in the transfer portal to add for the 2020-21 season.
 “It has to be the right piece, has to fit us,” Moren said. “I wouldn’t speculate on what position that is, but it certainly would have to be the right piece. We feel good about what we have on the roster right now. We feel good about the progress we’ll see from the young kids, but we’re keeping an eye on it for sure.
 “It’s a challenging time right now, so we don’t know. That’s one thing I’m curious about, what are these kids thinking right now when they don’t know if or when they can take a visit. It’s interesting now with the decisions people are making, but we have some time to watch and see who is considering or leaving places. One of the things we have right now is time.”
 The IU staff also found time to do some work on the 2021 recruiting class just before the pandemic dead period left coaches with little to do outside of social media and virtual visits. The Hoosiers will have to replace Keyanna Warthen, Patberg and Penn after next season.
 “At least we got two in-home visits to some top kids before this happened,” Moren said. “We have to do the rest on FaceTime. It will be interesting to see how that pans out. There is still a certain connection with being face to face with players and parents, getting an idea of how the staff and I interact, but the one thing I suppose is good is everybody has to do it the same way. No staff out there has an edge right now. We all have to recruit from a device. There are so many unknowns — don’t know if there’s going to be a summer circuit, if or when you can get visits on campus. We’re all in a holding pattern to see what’s next.”

 Health officer Scott Harris said the state will order the closure of businesses to the public in four categories:
 — Entertainment venues
 — Athletic facilities and activities
 — Non-essential “close-contact” businesses, and
 — Non-essential retail stores
 Harris also said the state will ban gatherings of 10 or more people except in business situations. That tightens an already-existing ban on gatherings of 25 or more.
 The new orders will be effective until April 17, Harris said.
 The move came as Alabama’s numbers of known COVID-19 patients on Friday kept climbing above 500, and the state recorded its second and third deaths from the illness. Harris said Friday that the state is investigating eight more deaths that may be related to COVID-19.

"The great thing about Texas Tech is the majority of our campus already uses Blackboard, so it's not a huge stretch to then start asking people to use Blackboard now for full teaching," he said.
 During the fiscal year of 2020, Louder said there were around 9,500 individual courses. About 8,400 of these courses utilized Blackboard in some way.
 "The transition to online is something that we're working through," he said. "We are recommending that faculty, you know, upload syllabi, of course, to Blackboard, upload lecture materials, powerpoints, very short videos."
 Regardless, Louder said there has to be interaction between students and faculty, whether that be in discussion boards or chat rooms.
 In addition to interaction in the course, some people may be concerned with certain aspects that may not be as effective online.
 Labs are more difficult to translate to an online format, Louder said. But work is being done to see how to effectively complete labs online and to consider the different formats.
 "It's going to have to take a little time working with the faculty members in particular," he said. "There are services that do virtual labs and things like that that we're looking at."
 Regarding performance-based classes and classes that require hands-on design and construction, Louder said there are multiple tools, such as Skype for Business and Blackboard Collaborate that allow students to showcase performance.
 For those concern about managing and submitting large project files, Louder said the use of large file transfer systems may be beneficial for faculty and students.
 "We will work with them to find solutions," he said. "It's not going to be the same because we're not going to be in-person, but we will find solutions to make sure classes are able to continue.
 In addition to learning, Louder said students still can get advised.
 "So, remote advising is available," he said, "and advisers will be using the tools they have available, like Skype for Business and Backboard Collaborate. Advisers are setting up some Blackboard shells."
 Students will be able to enter their Blackboard account and access advising resources, Louder said.

"articleBody" : "One of the biggest challenges during the lockdown period is to get the online supply chain through to the last point, in a vast country such as ours. Online grocery giants have complained of problems in getting supplies delivered. In many cases, trucks with supplies have been stopped and drivers held, the head of one online chain told a prominent media network. He cited the instances of at least two cities where delivery persons were not only detained and vehicles seized, but also beaten by the cops. Most online giants complained of major disruptions in the last-mile supply of food and grocery items. Though the items in question are among those exempted, they are facing problems from local authorities, was the common refrain. In a chain reaction, door delivery of food and grocery items got disrupted in several parts of the country. Delhi was among the first off the mark in putting a mechanism in place, as assured by the chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal. NOIDA, Gurugram and Ahmedabad have also reportedly been proactive in setting up systems for home delivery. Other states have been lagging behind, with lack of clarity on the banned items and exemptions The Centre and state governments have promised to iron out these issues and put proper mechanisms in place. Daily wage labourers are also among the worst-hit. They have been left high and dry with very little to back them up. The government needs to intervene with a relief scheme to save people who are trapped between COVID-19 on the one hand, and abject starvation on the other. In a relief to this segment, it was reported that the government is finalising an economic package which would include targeted money transfer to those in the unorganised sector, including daily wage workers.

Lausanne [Switzerland], Mar 28 (ANI): With the coronavirus pandemic forcing the cancellation of various sporting events, the World Archery has launched a stay at home online archery league to combat the spread of COVID-19.   Every week the apex body will release new short-distance round and accompanying unique target face in A4 and letter printable formats as part of its beat the outbreak Online Archery League.   The round running until March 29 consists of 15 arrows shot over distances of up to five, eight, ten or 18-plus metres.   The target face consists of 15 spots, each with three rings scoring one, two and four points. Inside-out arrows (not touching the line) in the red score three points, in the yellow score five points.   "At the end of each week, the top scorers at each distance and in each bowstyle will be recognised, the apex body said in an official statement.   "The competition is friendly, it's an honesty only rule system and the goal is for archers to compete with other archers, even if it's from the safety of their own homes," the statement further read.

Singapore’s Veredus Laboratories, for example, said it will soon release “Lab- on-Chip” kits to test patients for three kinds of coronavirus within two hours. Four American startups had also launched at-home tests for COVID-19, until the Food and Drug Administration unwisely demanded they stop issuing or testing kits.
 There are many other remarkable developments. For instance, only a few weeks after the beginning of this outbreak in the United States, many pharmaceutical firms worked at lightning speed to develop a vaccine. Last week, the first doses of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine were administered to a group of volunteers. Many companies are hard at work trying to come up with a cure. Whether it’s testing old medications to figure out if they can mitigate the virus’s effects or developing new drugs, the private sector is going full speed ahead to help.
 Americans, especially health care professionals, need face masks. Companies nationwide are shifting resources to produce more masks. The firm 3M, for instance, announced that it “ramped up to maximum production levels of N95 respirators and doubled our global output to a rate of more than 1.1 billion per year, or nearly 100 million per month.” 3M Chairman and CEO Mike Roman added that “more than 500,000 respirators are on the way from our South Dakota plant to two of the more critically impacted areas, New York and Seattle, with arrivals expected starting tomorrow. We are also ready to expedite additional shipments across the country.”

Just three weeks ago, after the Super Tuesday primaries, it looked as if we would know by now who the Democratic challenger to President Donald Trump will be. Former Vice President Joe Biden’s lead in pledged delegates over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was on track to become mathematically insurmountable, and Sanders would almost surely have had to suspend or end his campaign. It was supposed to be all over but the shouting.
 But because of COVID-19, potentially decisive primaries in Ohio, Georgia and other states have been postponed. At this point, with most Americans asked or ordered to practice social distancing, it is unclear when it will be possible to resume the primary process — or how that can be done safely.
 So the Democratic race is in suspended animation. Biden looks like the certain nominee, but this status has not been made official — and Sanders has not dropped out. There was supposed to be another debate between the two candidates in April, but the Democratic National Committee has not yet scheduled it. Sanders has said he is ready and willing to participate; Biden, perhaps understandably, has said that “I think we’ve had enough debates.”
 The primaries, when they resume, will probably look and feel different. There will likely be much more of an emphasis on mail-in voting, which will make it hard or impossible for officials to report results on the night of the primary. That would mean no victory or concession speeches, which is just as well, since those ritualistic appearances would seem pointless in the absence of wildly elated or sorely disappointed crowds. And crowds of any kind, of course, are at this point out of the question.
 If Sanders dropped out, all of the above would be academic — but only for the presidential race. State parties still need to choose candidates for important down-ballot contests, including Senate and House races. Somehow, the primaries have to be held.

The total number of novel coronavirus cases which have tested positive has now reached 706. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's website puts it at 706, out of which 640 are reported as active cases while 66 patients have been treated for COVID-19 and discharged. 16 deaths have been recorded in India and five of them were reported on Monday. The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has announced that 35 labs have been approved for coronavirus testing the country and that the number could be increased in the coming days. Maharashtra and Kerala have recorded the highest number of cases. The gradual spike in the number of cases over the past few days is as per the trajectory of COVID-19 pandemic across the world, experts say. However, some analysts also point out that testing in India has not been as aggressive as other countries such as South Korea, Italy and UK. South Korea has been able to get a grip on COVID-19 outbreak only because of its aggressive testing and tracing strategy, they point out. ICMR, on its part, asserts that the testing strategy it has adopted suits Indian conditions. Officials have also said that more testing would be done if required in the coming days. ",

“It's really important to us not to have to be open to the public,” said Mason County Auditor Paddy McGuire. “And I think it sends the wrong message."
 McGuire is one of the county auditors who has been informed the elections will proceed.
 “I have a three-person elections staff, and if my elections supervisor got sick, I'm not sure I can process and do everything we need to do to get the election done,” he said.
 Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey and Garfield County Auditor Donna Deal also said they’ve been notified the election would go forward. All three auditors had signed Wyman’s letter asking for the election to be canceled.
 Some steps in Washington’s voting process require two elections staffers to work together, such as for verifying the signatures of voters before ballots are counted, according to Deal.
 Now, Deal said she’ll have to find ways to keep those elections workers at least 6 feet apart while they work.
 “I have lots of concerns,” said Deal, whose April ballot has a hospital levy most voters will decide upon. “But that's just how it is.”
 Kimsey said Clark County has only a small number of voters participating in a school district issue on the ballot.
 “However, we continue to be concerned about keeping our staff healthy and minimizing their interaction with the public,” he said.

La Liga MX sigue en negociaciones para poder definir una fecha de regreso ante el paro por el coronavirus, sin embargo, algo que esta definido es que no podra reanudarse el torneo en las proximas seis semanas.Esto lo revelo el periodista David Medrano, quien de acuerdo con charlas entre dirigentes de la Liga con autoridades sanitarias han dejado claro que el reinicio del Clausura 2020 podria ser hasta el mes de mayo.Indico que, en el mejor de los escenarios, a partir del 8 de mayo se permitiria a los equipos reanudar los entrenamientos para que el dia 22 de ese mes se retome la competencia, sin precisar si esto sera con o sin aficionados en los estadios.Si este escenario se aplica, se recurriria a las jornadas dobles para que la Final del Clausura 2020 se celebre el 12 de julio y, una semana despues, comience el Apertura 2020.Ahora bien, en caso de que en las proximas seis semanas no se puedan regresar a los entrenamientos, se estaria manejando un Plan B, que consiste en reiniciar en junio; sin embargo, los tiempos no cuadrarian para el arranque del proximo torneo, pautado para el 17 de julio.Sobre esta posibilidad, no han contemplado el caso de America, Cruz Azul y Tigres, los equipos que estan en la Concachampions, ademas de Rayados y FC Juarez, que disputaran la Final de la Copa MX.

Whether Higgins is still available when the Indianapolis Colts go on the clock with the 34th overall pick on the second day of next month’s draft depends on a number of variables.
 But it’s not out of the question, particularly if several teams prioritize other positions in the first round with the idea they’ll be able to get quality receivers even early into the draft’s third day.
 Colts general manager Chris Ballard keeps his cards close to the vest, so this isn’t a prediction of his leanings in any way. But there are several elements to Higgins’ game that could make him a good fit in Indy.
 His ability to win so-called “jump balls” ranks high on the list.
 New quarterback Philip Rivers struggled in many areas during his final season with the Los Angeles Chargers in 2019. But his most consistent connection came with wide receiver Mike Williams, another big-bodied former Clemson star who isn’t afraid to fight for the ball in the air.
 The Colts don’t have that kind of weapon on their current roster. Higgins could quickly change that.
 Clemson was one of the few schools to get a pro day in this spring, and Higgins ran an unofficial 4.43-second 40-yard dash during the event. That helped prove a point he was trying to make at the Combine.
 He sees himself as a receiver who can stress defenses in a variety of ways.
 “A lot of people thought I was a slow tall guy, but the film speaks for itself,” Higgins said. “I’m not slow. I’m a tall guy that’s got great speed.”
 He’s watched NFL stars like A.J. Green and Julio Jones and attempted to incorporate elements of their games into his own.
 The results are littered throughout beaten defensive secondaries across the nation.
 Higgins caught 59 passes for 1,167 yards and 13 touchdowns last season, and he had 135 receptions for 2,448 yards and 27 touchdowns in his three-year Clemson career.
 He understands the pro game will be a new challenge, and he’ll need to show he can run the full route tree.
 He also firmly believes he’s the top wideout prospect in this loaded class.
 “I feel like I’m the No. 1 guy,” Higgins said. “I feel like I can go to a team and immediately impact that team and help that team get to the Super Bowl.”
