  Museveni was my age when he put (Apollo Milton) Obote on notice’ – regarding the consequences of rigging the election in 1980. He knows what will happen next if the election is rigged.”   That was the Kyadondo East MP and presidential aspirant for the National Unity Platform (NUP), Mr Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, in an interview on a local television station.


  In the run up to the 1980 election, a young Yoweri Museveni of the Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM) vowed to take up arms and fight the government if the election was not free and fair. Kept his word he did and went to the tall grasses of Luweero. The rest is history.


  Whether Bobi Wine intends to follow Museveni’s Luweero history is not obviously stated. It, therefore, would be redundant and unfair to discuss the matter of him leading an armed struggle. What would be of interest is a lesson drawn from recent history, which makes Bobi Wine’s statements very petrifying.


  After Reform Agenda’s (RA) presidential candidate Col Kizza Besigye fled into exile fearing for his life after the bitterly contested election of 2001, a rebel group called the Peoples Redemption Army (PRA) sprung up like a bolt out of the blue.


  Col Besigye was accused of electing to use the bullet after failing at the ballot, using the PRA as his vehicle. Supporters of RA, including Besigye’s younger brother Joseph Musasizi, were arrested and charged with treason.


  ‘Sasi’ as Musasizi was fondly called, died after being freed from a long stint behind the prison gate. A person like Patrick Manenero, who was arrested on July 20, 2002 died in detention.

STOCKHOLM (AP) — Sweden is stepping up its defense activities in the Baltic Sea due to “a deteriorating security situation” as Russia and NATO conduct military operations in the area. The Swedish armed forces said Tuesday that it initiated a “high-readiness action” in the southeastern and southern Baltic Sea due to the “current, extensive military activity” in the region. Sweden is not a member of NATO. The armed forces gave no details about the deployment but said the goal “is to strengthen maritime surveillance in the Baltic Sea at sea and from the air.” Sweden's chief of joint military operations described the activities of Russia and the West in some areas as the most intense since the Cold War.

Government consumption will have to fuel demand till the economy comes out of the coronavirus (COVID-19) shock and regains pre-COVID-19 momentum, the Reserve Bank of India’s annual report said on Tuesday.


  ‘RBI at end of rate-cut cycle, fiscal steps must for recovery’


  Private consumption, which has lost its discretionary elements across the board, particularly transport services, hospitality, recreation and cultural activities, will come in later as “behavioural restraints may prevent the normalisation of demand for these activities”, RBI said in the annual report.


  Going forward, it said, “government consumption is expected to continue pandemic-proofing of demand, and private consumption is expected to lead the recovery when it takes hold, with non-discretionary spending leading the way until a durable increase in disposable incomes enables discretionary spending to catch up.”


  Banks set to restructure up to ₹8.4 lakh cr. of loans: Ind-Ra


  An assessment of aggregate demand during the year so far suggests that the shock to consumption is severe, and it will take quite some time to mend and regain the pre-COVID-19 momentum, it said.


  The Reserve Bank’s survey for the month of July indicates that consumer confidence fell to an all-time low, with a majority of respondents reporting pessimism relating to the general economic situation, employment, inflation and income.


  The respondents, however, do indicate expectations of recovery for the year ahead.


  Urban consumption demand has suffered a bigger blow - passenger vehicle sales and supply of consumer durables in Q1 of 2020-21 have dropped to a fifth and one-third, respectively, of their level a year ago; air passenger traffic has ground to a halt. Rural demand, by contrast, has fared better, it added.


  The RBI expects GDP growth to remain negative this fiscal. The official estimates of GDP for Q1 FY21 by the National Statistical Office (NSO) are slated to be released on August 31.


  Meanwhile, the report said high frequency indicators so far point to a retrenchment in activity that is unprecedented in history.


  “Moreover, the upticks that became visible in May and June after the lockdown was eased in several parts of the country, appear to have lost strength in July and August, mainly due to reimposition or stricter imposition of lockdowns, suggesting that contraction in economic activity will likely prolong into Q2,” it said.


  The total e-way bills issuance, an indicator of domestic trading activity, increased by 70.3% in June 2020 on a month-on-month (m-o-m) basis. In July, however, it increased by only 11.4% m-o-m and remained 7.3% lower than a year ago.


  The report further said the Google mobility trend, which tracks movement of people as a reflection of underlying economic activity, picked up in June 2020 from its levels in April and May.


  Mobility around groceries and pharmacies reached pre-COVID-19 levels, while mobility relating to retail and recreation was around 60% lower than that of February 2020 levels, transit activity was 40% lower.


  In July, however, moderation set in, with retail and recreation mobility stagnant, and some slide in people’s movement around groceries and pharmacies.


  The report also notes that government consumption spending has provided a measure of relief, with Central government’s revenue expenditure, net of interest payments and major subsidies, having risen by 33.7% in the first quarter of the year.


  “Public finances have, however, been stretched by the imperative to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and headroom for continuing support to aggregate demand may be severely diminished,” it said.


  It stressed that the pandemic will inflict deep disfigurations on the world economy. The shape of the future is heavily contingent upon the evolving intensity, spread and duration of COVID-19 and the discovery of the elusive vaccine.


  Post-COVID-19, the overwhelming sense is that the world will not be the same again and a new normal could emerge.


  As in the rest of the world, India’s potential output can undergo a structural downshift as the recovery driven by stimulus and regulatory easing gets unwound in a post-pandemic scenario, the RBI said.

 Government just announced plans to procure tablets for pupils in Universal Primary Education (UPE) schools across the country. The move is intended to facilitate digital learning as a way of improving literacy and numeracy during the Covid-19 lockdown.   From the time Uganda was hit by the lethal pandemic, a lot has been taking place, but the scramble and partition of government resources cannot go unnoticed - all under the cover of curbing the spread of coronavirus. Huge sums of money have been released to us from different donors to effect the same cause. Items such as milk donated by the citizenry reached only a few. Food distribution remained insufficient and mainly those near the city centre had a glance on the Covid food. The distribution of mask does not seem to have been any better! (Are you thinking what I am thinking?).   Shortly afterwards, came a promise of distributing radios and TVs to villages, but even before this promises were fulfilled, plans of procuring tablets has been made. Anyone can testify that Internet charges in Uganda are very expensive, especially for those who operate online. Ideally, this would have been the best time to reduce Internet charges if the government really cares about the common man.   Let’s break down the obvious costs. On average, one needs about Shs2,200 to buy data of about 300 megabytes. That means that a parent must part with about Shs50,000 per month on just Internet charges. Since a parent whose child in a UPE school is likely not be using electricity, the same parent will be spending money on getting the tablet charged at Shs1,000 a day, meaning that about Shs30,000 a month. These are just net costs. Isn’t this like what the Queen of France then Marie Antoinette told her starving peasant subjects during the French Revolution? These are the same schools that lack pit- latrines, proper classrooms, and whose teacher-to-student ration is very high.   How can one plan to buy tablets for pupils whose families cannot afford a meal, school uniform, sanitary pads, etc?   How can one expect such a family to afford Shs3,200 a day? Moreover, it is planned that both parents and teachers will be involved in teaching children how to use tablets. But will parents who do not even have time to talk to their children get time to teach them. And how will children with disabilities be catered for? What if these tablets are mismanaged? A couple of years ago, tablets were given to MPs and it was evident that many of them were mismanaged. Some of the MPs even wanted to be exempted from paying the OTT. If MPs can feel the pinch of OTT, how about ordinary people?   The government and other stakeholders should always make realistic promises. Let MPs ask the masses what can best work for them in terms of education.

 That the Inspector General of Government (IGG) has said they are working on a new strategy to unmask public leaders who hide undeclared wealth behind their children’s names is more than welcome news.   It is welcome because the country is bleeding from many fronts as a result of widespread corruption.   Uganda is the 137th least corrupt nation out of 175 countries, according to the 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index reported by Transparency International. Uganda’s best ranking on corruption was in 1996, when the country ranked 43, reaching an all-time high of 151 in 2016.   Some studies, such as the Global Integrity report, have over the years estimated that more than half of the government’s annual Budget is lost to corruption each year.   It is public knowledge that many public officials who feel their income or duration of employment is not in tandem with the property they own, use such tactics to avoid taxes and skirt financial oversight – and under-declare their wealth.   The tactics may vary. Those at the highest level of government and business usually stash wealth in offshore accounts or use their connections to hide wealth. For instance, recent reports by an international coalition of media outlets on an investigation with the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, brought to light details of offshore assets and services of politicians, businesses and celebrities.   In 2018, the then IGG, Justice Irene Mulyagonja, said most corrupt government officials were “hiding behind” the back of President Museveni and use their connection to the Head of State to defeat or escape justice.   This is why what the Deputy IGG George Bamugemereire said at the weekend needs every stakeholder’s support.   He said the IGG has submitted proposed amendments in the current law to Parliament seeking to expand the breaches, offences and punishment for telling lies and under-declaration of assets.   The Leadership Code Act as amended in 2017, which is in Parliament, seeks revision of some provisions to empower the Leadership Code Tribunal to take tougher action against leaders who under-declare their wealth or hide wealth behind their children or spouses.   We ask Parliament to fast-track this provision and give the IGG enough teeth to bite such public servants.   Corruption deprives the public of services such as health, education, roads, food, and energy. Yet also, illicit acquisition of wealth makes leaders ever yearning to enrich themselves at the expense of service delivery. This must stop.

It was alleged that he had been tortured by security agents on the orders of the late Brig Noble Mayombo, the then head of the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence (CMI).


  Rogue security agents or even impostors and con men had a field day extorting and blackmailing Opposition supporters and business people by threatening to arrest them for being ‘PRA rebels’ or sympathisers.


  There was an air of fear for jail and life by would be followers, which scuttled the mobilisation of members of the Opposition. Col Besigye returned from exile in 2005 to contest for the presidential election in 2006, he was welcomed by treason charges.


  When Col Besigye and his co-accused were granted bail, the High Court was surrounded by armed men in black T-shirts and they were arrested and back to jail they went. The Military Court Martial in Makindye then slapped similar charges against them and kept them in the coolers.


  Col Besigye was granted bail, which prompted many with a seemingly propaganda motive to criticise him for ‘misleading’ other people and leaving them in trouble after cutting a deal with ‘the dictator’ for himself. His co-accused remained there for long spells. Some were only released much later after asking for amnesty ‘confirming’ that the PRA actually existed.


  One of the greatest assets of regimes that have a military background is violence. That is their turf. They will do everything to translate contention into a violent military confrontation. One makes it easy for them if they threaten or imply that they intend to be violent.   It works so well for them because in a situation of violence, the law takes the back seat and there an autocratic regime has the licence to arrest, torture, destroy and kill in the interest of ‘national security.’ National security also comes with good budgets that are under the vote of ‘classified expenditure’ and is very enriching for many involved in security.   One of the first tricks in the book is quoting Opposition politicians who in any way suggest opting for violence. Then they blow out of proportion and context what they said so that it is interpreted as a declaration of war.   This is dressed up and linked to a nice sounding outfit of a rebel grouping complete with ‘prisoners of war’ arrested from the ‘frontline.’   They may also throw in a parade of hitherto armed Sauls turned to Pauls, ‘seeking for amnesty.’ These confess that they “realised that fighting against the government, which has brought a lot of peace and development was futile and only intended to cause suffering of innocent people by misleading selfish politicians.”   So Bobi Wine should weigh his words carefully. Even as a hoax intended to threaten and make one appear serious, putting the government on notice for dire consequences if they do not deliver a credible election or anything else puts the burden on the one who initiates it.   In the 80s under the UPC regime of Obote, Uganda had DP President General Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere claiming that he was compiling a Black Book. In this book, he was documenting and detailing human rights abusers to be exposed when it was safe to do so. It dented his reputation when the book was never published.   In the recent past, Col Besigye has promised a ‘Tsunami’ and other mass actions against the regime, all of which have not amounted to much. Many are now sceptical about his promise to enact ‘Plan B’ after declaring that he will not stand for the presidency.   To be taken seriously and for his reputation and security of his followers, Bobi Wine should either fold up his sleeves ready to go the entire nine yards or forget about it. In these matters of violence, there is no half way house.   It is all or nothing, a yes or a no, anything more than this is a temptation from the devil, that leads one into playing into the hands of the enemy.

  The newlyweds are believed to have had a mini-moon in France, and were also recently spotted on Italy's Amalfi coast with Edo's son, Wolfie. But once all wedding celebrations are wrapped up, what's next for the couple?


  Well, __ it seems there could be a house move on the cards.
