The Clorox Company (CLX) shares on Tuesday's trading session, dropped -4.74 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $222.30 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of $7.36 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $7.95 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is 12.00% and predicted to reach at 3.84% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out- come was 7.50% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 3.99% for the next five year.

I clearly remember the first time somebody brought me here. It was after a rough disco night, and the next day she asked me if I would like to tag along. Ever since, when I'm in Barcelona, I go back. What this building did to me and how I feel about it are so particular--so overwhelming and so soothing. I've spent hours and hours in this place, changing perspectives once in a while and just taking it all in. It's the most peaceful man-made place that I know. And you can't really pull it apart: it's not really a building--it's just a few walls and a roof with pools, a statue, and a chair. There's not much else going on--with Mies van der Rohe being a minimalist. But every detail is perfect.

In the 1700s, there was no Motel 6. If you were traveling, it was the tavern that kept the light on for you.
   
 According to John D. Whitford, a local who wrote articles on New Bern history back in the 1880s, our first tavern was located "near the point where Short street runs into New Street ("Short" is now Linden Street) and called the Bryan tavern.
   
 That's right across the road from where our current historian and character- about-town, Nelson McDaniel, lives. I have stood by Nelson's yard and looked to where Bryan's house of refreshment and rest must have stood, but you really can't picture what was there by looking at it today. There's no resemblance.
   
 "It was on a creek that extended to the lot of the writer (Whitford lived in a house that still stands on New and Craven streets) of this is, while, digging a well a few years ago, a plank wharf was found down in the earth, with cypress shingles of sound condition under it."
   
 Whiford describes the Bryan tavern as if it was in a grand building of some sort.
   
 "A great place of resort in its day," he wrote, "Disputes were either settled there or arrangements made to settle them on the field." One imagines smokey candles or lanterns lighting up glowering expressions of men demanding apologies or explanations, of determinations of how many paces or whether the moment to fire would be determined by a spoken command or a dropped handkerchief.
   
 New Bern is not known for its duels, however. In fact, we only know of one that was definitely carried off in town - the Stanly-Spaight duel of 1802. Perhaps Mr. Whitford is romanticizing, or perhaps there were more that we just don't know about, that didn't stir up the public interest the way that Misters Spaight and Stanly did.
   
 The tavern must have been large, for Whitford remembers "Balls… constantly given there, and many grand dinners did our fathers enjoy in it for years when the rum punch would flow as free as water and that he who would not drink to the bottom was considered no man at all."
   
 The owner, he wrote elsewhere, was a John Bryan. He assigns this Mr. Bryan as a contractor of sorts, who built the city's first courthouse and jail on Pollock and Hancock streets for the sum of $2,400.
   
 I've looked for taverns in the area in the past, digging through newspapers or old manuscripts. In his historical book, "The Home Story of a Walking Stick," Whitford mentions Heiskill's tavern in the 1820s but gives no information about it.
   
 The North Carolina Gazette, between 1796 and 1807, made references to a tavern purchased by one Mitchell Downs, "in the commodious house lately occupied by A. Neale, Esq., in Middle street, near the corner of Pollock street, at the sing of Arms of the United States." He promised patrons "good provisions and a plentiful, stock of the best liquors."
   
 The papers also mention the Eagle Tavern, where one could find a certain Mrs. Douglas who was selling tickets to a play in 1797 - the tickets could also be bought at "Mr. Mitchell's Tavern," whom we will assume is the same Mitchell Downs.
   
 When I wrote "Honour," the musical about the Stanly-Spaight duel, I decided to let Mr. Mitchell own the Eagle as well, and placed much of my action there.
   
 I have also found "Mr. (Joseph) Oliver's Tavern" on Middle Street being described in 1795 and again in 1796. Middle Street must not have been the driest spot in North Carolina at the turn of that century and, with all the sailors in town, I imagine the local sheriff spent a lot of his time between that street and the jail that Mr. Bryan built, dragging bruised and battered men for some drying-out time in the cells.
   
 The taverns were frequently referred to as landmarks. "William Hawley, Merchant Taylor, Begs leave to inform his friends and customers, and the public in general, that he still continues to carry on his business in Middle Street, nearly opposite Mr. Joseph Oliver's Tavern," a 1796 advertisement reads. "The above articles are exposed for sale at the House on Middle Street next door above Mr. Mitchell's Tavern, and nearly opposite the (Episcopal) Church," an 1807 ad notes.
   
 Absolute teetotalers probably had a hard time finding anything if their drinking buddies didn't point them out.

Dear Dave,   My in-laws have very generously offered my wife and me $250,000 to help with a down payment on a home. I know the amount exceeds the IRS's yearly gift allowance, but they want to structure it as a family loan and have already told us they don't care if we pay it back. If we accept, we technically owe them a lot of money. If we say no, they may be offended. What do you think about this and how it might impact the relationship?   James
 Dear James,   Well, it makes sense your wife would be on board with the whole thing. It's her dad making the offer, so of course, she would be a lot more comfortable with the idea than you are.
 This is a big deal, and it's something you two should have a very serious conversation about. Get on the same page in every regard. Also, I'd recommend making sure you get everything in writing. See to it, as well, that it can be forgiven at the maximum allowable annual gift rate.
 In addition, in the event of death, make sure it's included in the estate, it's forgiven and there will be zero call on the note. In effect, that would make it an advance on your inheritance instead of debt. Under no circumstances should they, or any other heirs, have grounds to call the note.
 That's a good question, James. And a nice gift!   Dave
 Keeping the side hustle alive
    Dear Dave,   I have a full-time job, but I also have a side job providing firewood to help pay off debt. I make $600 to $1,000 a month with this project. My log splitter went down recently when a hydraulic line burst and the machine caught on fire. I'm not sure how much it will cost to get it going again. Should I invest in a new one that will increase my productivity and help me pay off debt faster?   Chris
 Dear Chris,   If I'm in your shoes, I'm going to fix the old one. Even if it means duct tape and glue, I'm going to try to find a way to repair it instead of spending a bunch of money or going deeper into debt.
 If you can't do that at a reasonable price out of pocket, I'd be in the market for a decent, used log splitter. And pay cash! I get your line of thinking when it comes to increasing productivity. Splitting wood is real work. But don't try to justify buying an expensive, new piece of equipment when it's just not necessary.
 If you're making that much with a side hustle, you can make your money back on a used splitter in a month or two - three at the most. Be smart about it, Chris!   Dave

santiago. La situación que enfrentan desde hace meses los empresarios hoteleros dista muchos de ser la ideal. Las cifras de julio muestran las caídas que está sufriendo el sector en medio de la pandemia por covid19.
 La Asociación Hostelería Compostela realizó ayer su balance del mes de julio, así como su previsión para agosto con números notablemente inferiores a los del verano de 2019. En el caso de ocupación en los hoteles, la cifra del mes pasado es del 26,30 por ciento, cuando en julio de 2019 rozó el 75 %, con un 74,67.
 En el caso de las pensiones, el balance es similar. El mes de julio dejó un 21,10 % de ocupación, lejos del 75,45 % registrado un año atrás. Julio es, tradicionalmente, un mes bueno para el comercio y el turismo en Compostela por las fiestas del Apóstol.
 En cuanto a la previsión para agosto, la Asociación es positiva, y considera que va a haber un crecimiento. Estima que los hoteles estarán al 33 por ciento de su capacidad, y un 28 en el caso de las pensiones. En todo caso, ambas proyecciones se alejan bastante del 75 % de ocupación del mismo mes de 2019.
 ¿Y qué pasa si cogemos los datos anuales de antes de la pandemia? Pues obtenemos que, incluso en los meses de invierno que son habitualmente menos turísticos, las cifras son mejores que las actuales. En enero, los hoteles de Santiago tuvieron un 34 % de ocupación, y un 40% las pensiones. Después, en febrero, cuando ya resonaban las noticias sobre el coronavirus, la cifra en los hoteles subió hasta el 37 %, mientras que en las pensiones se mantuvo en el 40. En marzo, todas las previsiones se quedaron en eso, porque la realidad se encargó de paralizar los viajes de placer.
 Más allá de estos datos ofrecidos por los empresarios hoteleros, hay un aspecto a tener en cuenta, y es que hay numerosos establecimientos cerrados. Uno de los propietarios de un hotel del casco histórico contaban recientemente que había decidido atrasar su apertura para realizar obras, dado que había menos actividad. Y los que sí deciden mantener su rutina, viven constantes cancelaciones. a.oca

At one point this spring, it wasn't known whether anyone would sprint from the dugout to any softball field.
   
 So as the Cherryville Angels 10-under girls softball team took the field recently ahead of first pitch at the Dixie Softball World Series, Wes Brown made sure to soak the moment in.
   
 "We told them before we left: 'Let's have fun, make memories and win,'" Cherryville Angels softball coach said. "We accomplished all three."
   
 Representing 'The Old North State,' the Cherryville 10-under girls softball team returned home with third-place medals after going 2-2 at the Dixie Softball World Series.
   
 "To say I'm proud of the girls is an understatement," Wes Brown said. "They played their hearts out. … Very few girls have the opportunity to play in the Dixie World Series. This was something these girls will never forget."
   
 After a rude welcome to the tournament via an 11-1 loss to Paxton, Florida, the team rebounded with a 5-0 victory over Belleview, Florida. In the win, pitchers Avery Cruise, Jenny Brown and Zoe Culberson combined to throw a no- hitter.
   
 Cherryville carried the momentum into its next game, scoring eight runs in the first two innings to take a 17-2 victory over Wahneta, Florida. Livi Harmon hit a grand slam as part of the Angels' scoring barrage.
   
 Despite falling into an early three-run hole, Cherryville battled back in its semifinal contest against Ward 10, Louisiana, to tie the game on a Harmon three-run blast before taking a 4-3 lead. The advantage wouldn't last though, Ward 10 having the final say in a 12-4 result.
   
 Jenny Brown, Avery Cruise, Zoe Culberson and Harmon were joined on the team by Addy Carpenter, Georgia Cruise, Blair Culberson, Oakley Herring, Tori Ladd, Addy Morehead and Hailey Vance.
   
 Wes Brown was assisted by Mathew Anthony and Wes Culberson on the coaching staff.
   
 For the Angels, such an opportunity was a labor of love by the Cherryville community, presented as a result of sponsorships, donations and other fundraising efforts.
   
 "On behalf of Cherryville Dixie Softball, we can't thank the community enough for the support given to these girls," Brown said. "We would like to thank all the sponsors, donations, fundraiser participants and many throughout our area for making this truly a dream come true for these girls."
   
 The team will be recognized by the Cherryville community on Wednesday, members riding aboard a firetruck on Main St. at 6 p.m.

It is a lot to consider, but in the minds of our family, the evidence is clear. After considering all the objective criteria and assessing the situation in our own community, we have made the decision to keep our girls out of school for the time being. This was not an easy decision, but one that we believe best respects the science, decreases the risk of further spread and follows the task force criteria. As a compromise, we will allow our children to have a physically distanced orientation meeting with their new teachers so they can meet them in person before starting to interact with them on a screen. And, after two weeks, we will reassess. It will also be important for us to understand what the triggers will be in our school, in terms of newly diagnosed infections or illnesses, that will require a return to virtual learning. Full and honest transparency from everyone will be more necessary than ever.

HARRISON COUNTY, Miss. (WLOX) - Fire departments in Mississippi are getting nearly $1.4 million dollars in federal grant funding to use for safety upgrades.The federal grants provide funds for expenses such as the equipment, apparatus, training and salaries necessary to protect and serve&nbsp;communities. The grants are available through FEMA’s Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program.Of the 12 departments in Mississippi that have received this grant in 2020, Harrison County Fire Services is the only department in the six coastal counties to receive funding. The county received $623,527, which is the largest amount of any of the Mississippi departments awarded grant money through this program this year.That money will be used to replace their self-contained breathing apparatuses, which are used by firefighters every day to breathe safely during fire rescues. Harrison County Fire Chief Pat Sullivan says the much-needed upgrades will protect the lives of firefighters and victims.“So this is replacing our outdated air packs. All air packs have a life span and ours have reached their life span,” explained Harrison County Fire Chief Pat Sullivan. Being able to put this air pack on, go inside, do the search, find the victim, get them out, and get to the seat of the fire... thats the meat and potatoes of what we do. Save lives, protect property.”Under the AFG program, career and volunteer fire departments and other eligible organizations can receive funding through three different grants to enhance a fire department’s/safety organization’s ability to protect the health and safety of firefighters and the public, assist fire prevention programs and support firefighter health and safety research and development, and/or increase or maintain the number of trained “front line” firefighters available in communities.Copyright 2020 WLOX.

URBANA--The December futures price of corn settled in a range of $3.20 - $3.25 over the last few trading sessions. According to University of Illinois agricultural economist, Todd Hubbs, questions regarding a price bottom for corn bubbled up in market discussions.  "A yield-enhancing weather outlook and flattening ethanol production offset large export sales last week," Hubbs says. "A change in the recent corn price pattern involves a smaller corn crop than those formed by current market expectations."
   
 Corn demand presented a mixed bag over the last few weeks. After a steady recovery in ethanol production, the last three weeks saw weekly production level out. Production levels averaged 932,000 barrels a day over the period. While sharply higher than the 537,000 barrels seen at the end of April, the production level sits 10.1% lower than over a similar period last year.
   
 Current USDA estimates of corn use for ethanol sit at 4.85 billion bushels for the marketing year. Through June, corn used in ethanol production totaled 4.02 billion bushels. Based on estimates of corn use using EIA weekly ethanol production, corn consumption for ethanol as of July 31 is approximately 4.43 billion bushels.
   
 "The refinery-operating rate stalled at roughly 80%, yet gasoline stocks continue to grow," Hubbs says. "Gasoline demand remains weak despite being in the summer driving season. If ethanol production levels match totals seen in July over the next month, corn use for ethanol production comes in 10-15 million bushels below the USDA estimate.
   
 "If ethanol production falls back due to lower gasoline demand, corn use for ethanol looks to fall further," he adds.
   
 Export sales to China dominated the positive news for corn demand. Most of the large purchases are for the 2020-21 marketing year. Export sales for the next marketing year sit near 435 million bushels with China accounting for 225 million bushels of those sales, Hubbs explains. "While a positive development, Chinese buying is rapidly approaching the 283 million bushel level set for their tariff rate quota [TRQ] on corn imports from a country."
   
 Purchases above the TRQ level see tariffs jump to 65%. Hubbs says it seems doubtful that China looks to buy more U.S. corn under higher tariff levels given Chinese stocks supposedly sit near 8 billion bushels.
   
 "Flooding, armyworms, and uncertainty regarding corn stock quality in China all support recent purchases and could lead to an increase in the quota level. If all of those sales to China come to fruition next marketing year, the prospect of reaching USDA's projection of 2.15 billion bushels in 2020-21 looks much brighter, if a tad optimistic, in the current economic environment," he adds.
   
 USDA estimates corn exports for 2019-20 at 1.775 billion bushels this marketing year. Exports through June total 1.43 billion bushels, down over 22% from last year over the same period. Accumulated exports through Aug. 6 came in at 1.64 billion bushels. With slightly over three weeks left in the marketing year, an additional 134 million bushels of exports are required to reach the current USDA estimate.
   
 Export inspections must average 37.6 million bushels per week. For the four weeks that ended Aug. 6, weekly export inspections averaged 38.3 million bushels per week. Outstanding sales for this marketing year through July 30 total 200 million bushels with China accounting for almost 50 million bushels. The recent pace of export inspections indicates exports remain on pace to come in close to the current estimate, Hubbs notes.
   
 "Excellent crop ratings kicked speculation on this year's corn crop into high gear. A consensus formed around national yields ending up higher than USDA's forecast of 178.5 bushels per acre. Supply considerations drove futures prices lower as the market priced in a large crop," he says.
   
 The relationship between the seasonal average farm price and the stocks-to-use ratio provides insight into the question of market expectations of crop size. The closing futures prices for corn on Aug. 7 indicated a marketing-year farm price of $3.19 per bushel. For this analysis, a $3.19 average farm price relates to a stocks-to-use ratio of 21.3% for the 2020-21 marketing year. The estimated relationship between price and the stocks-to-use ratio uses data from the last 10 marketing years.
   
 The recent projection for corn use sits at 14.625 billion bushels. The possibility of corn consumption at the projected level remains quite uncertain given economic conditions. By assuming the projected USDA total use for the next marketing year, a stocks-to-use ratio of 21.3% infers ending stocks for the 2020-21 marketing year at 3.12 billion bushels. Using beginning stocks of 2.285 billion bushels and an import level of 25 million bushels during the next marketing year, the corn crop implied by the current market price equals 15.43 billion bushels.
   
 "Assuming the 2020 U.S. corn harvested acreage remains near the June acreage total of 84.1 million acres, a crop size of 15.43 billion bushels implies a corn yield of 183.5 bushels per acre. While a few recent yield projections came in near this total, the potential for a yield below this level seems likely," Hubbs says. "My current yield forecast for the U.S. sits at 180.7 bushels per acre. August weather looks to go a long way in determining the eventual size of the crop. A change in corn planted acreage remains in the picture as well."
   
 The USDA takes their initial cut at the size of the 2020 corn crop in the Aug. 12 crop production report. "An increase from present projections of the corn crop seems in the offing. The magnitude of the change in corn production is the critical component for any scenario were corn prices find a bottom," Hubbs notes.

We all know sunflowers (helianthus), as they are one of the most recognizable flowers. Their brilliant color and rustic charm endear them to young and old, gardener and painter. They grace gardens and fields, blooming in the latter part of the summer. Those tall stalks not only beg our attention, but they also attract birds, butterflies and bees. I will always remember driving on a back road near Baltimore and coming across a breath-taking sight of sunflowers. The countryside was glowing with these bright, canary-yellow flowers that embellished the road for a long way. I have read and seen pictures of the fields in Italy, where you see sunflowers for miles, and I felt I was experiencing that sight.      Each August, I ask my son Will to let me know when his field of sunflowers is blooming. I like to go and just enjoy the site and to pick some for the house. I am always curious which way they will be facing when I visit his field. It is fun to watch the young flowers turn eastward at dawn to greet the sun. Then, as the sun starts to rise above the horizon, these charming flowers begin their romance with the sun as they follow it across the sky. By sunset time, they will be facing west to watch the sun disappear into the horizon. Then by morning, they are all facing east again and are ready to start again.      Sunflowers come in many different colors and sizes. There are the tall ones that come to mind when someone mentions sunflowers. There are also medium- sized ones that grow to about 4 or 5 feet. Today, you can even get dwarf varieties that are quite charming, only growing to about 2 feet tall. Their colors have a wide range of hues too, going from brilliant yellow to rust, brown and amber and shades in-between.      There are also sunflowers that are continuous bloomers. This spring, I was visiting nurseries as I usually do, mask on and keeping a distance of course; I was introduced to some new plants as I roamed the isles. I always want to see what the different garden centers bring in to sell and to see which plants are the most popular.      On my ventures to nurseries, two new annual sunflowers caught my attention. The first one was named SunBelievable or Brown Eyed Girl Helianthus. It has the happy face of a sunflower with multi-branching and dwarf in size. SunBelievable has golden yellow petals that become reddish-brown towards the base and they blend well into a dark brown center. This plant does not produce seed, putting all of its energy into making a constant crop of flowers. They are cheerful looking in the container and I was told that they bloomed all summer long. I was keen to give this plant a try.      When I purchased them, they had a few blooms and I assumed as the plant grew, I would see more. They have looked nice all summer, but now they are about to explode with even more blooms. I was content with the number I was getting, but in a week, I will have a bush with even more flowers covering the plant at a time when other flowers are starting to fade.      Shortly after finding SunBelievable, I was visiting another nursery and I spotted another dwarf sunflower that was bright, clear yellow. It was named Sunfinity. This plant was about 18 inches tall with yellow, daisy-looking flowers that were quite cheerful looking. This plant was developed to give the home gardener colorful, long-lasting sunflower looking blooms that are smaller and bloom over several months. Sunfinity was created to have many stems with a multitude of blooms to flower all season long. This was a unique and different way to look at sunflowers. They do not have the large heads of what I think of as traditional sunflowers - the bloom is only about 3 inches wide. However, the number of blooms and the length of time they have flowers make up for the size.      There are companies that specialize in all the new and exciting sunflowers and catalogs to tempt you. You can save your seeds, but remember that cross- pollination could have occurred and you might not get a flower that is exactly like the one you collected seed from. It is best to purchase new fresh seeds each year if you want a particular looking sunflower. Sunflowers are a joy to grow, and I hope I always have some to greet the morning and to brighten the countryside.

If you missed Friday's edition of 20/20 a few weeks ago, it was quite interesting. It provided an in-depth look at COVID-19 from when it first emerged in China to when patient zero showed up in the USA and the decline of normalcy as we knew it.
   
 One infectious disease doctor made the comparison between this pandemic and the movie Contagion. The ending scene depicts jungles being destroyed by bulldozers leaving animals homeless.
   
 A swarm of bats head towards a populated area finding refuge in the rafters of a hog farm confinement subsequently dropping their feces after which the hogs ate it.
   
 For those not familiar with hogs--they eat anything and everything.
   
 When my late Hubs was a detective in Knox County he investigated an incident where a farmer was feeding his hogs, had a heart attack and fell in with them.
   
 Yeah, he had a stomach of steel and could handle anything I would freak out about. The first few sentences of that trip down memory lane was more than enough for me.
   
 I digress.
   
 I'm not interested in your political proclivities. I can read about those 24-7 on social media.
   
 That being said, President George W. Bush, who many took pot shots at for his frequent speaking gaffes, (personally, I think it's a matter of him not being a good public speaker-he got flustered and the important information he shared didn't make the news cycle).
   
 On 9/11, numerous people applauded him for the way he initially handled the news. He was in the middle of reading a book to youngsters, stayed calm, didn't worry them or scare them and made his exit.
   
 People who took the time to criticize him said he should have left right away, got up and sped out of there.
   
 Yeah, makes sense. He definitely should have scared the bejeezus out of all of those little kids, the teachers, parents, press, so on and so forth. He was scared himself, didn't know exactly what was going on, but knew there was a ton of chaos as well as a lot of loss of life.
   
 Why can't anything ever just be partisan?
   
 Not everything HAS to be freakin' political!
   
 In the summer of 2005 he was at his ranch in Crawford, Texas reading a book about the 1918 flu pandemic.
   
 It literally "freaked" him out.
   
 Written by historian John M. Barry, "The Great Influenza" the book told the story of the 1918 plague that "would kill more people than the outbreak of any other disease in human history."
   
 The issue that bothered G.W. the most was reading a new plague occurs around every 100 years.
   
 Upon returning to Washington, he called a meeting with his top homeland security adviser in the Oval Office and gave her the galley of Barry's book Bush had read in Texas.
   
 President Bush told Fran Townsend, "You've got to read this," 'Look, this happens every 100 years. We need a national strategy.'"
   
 What followed was the nation's most comprehensive pandemic plan--a playbook that included diagrams for a global early warning system, funding to develop new, rapid vaccine technology, and a robust national stockpile of critical supplies such as FACE MASKS and VENTILATORS.
   
 This is according to Townsend.
   
 The effort was intense over the ensuing three years, including exercises where cabinet officials gamed out their responses, but it was not sustained.
   
 Large swaths of the ambitious plan were either not fullly realized or entirely shelved as other priorities and crises took hold.
   
 However, elements of that effort have formed the foundation for the national response to the coronavirus pandemic underway right now.
   
 "Despite politics,despite changes, when a crisis hits, you pull what you've got off the shelf and work from there," Townsend said.
   
 Many of his aides harbored doubts when Bush first told them he wanted to focus on the potential of a global pandemic.
   
 Over several months, cabinet officials got behind the idea. Most of them had governed through the Sept. 11 terror attacks, so events considered unlikely, but highly -impactful had a certain resonance.
   
 Tom Bossert worked in the Bush White House and went on to serve as homeland security adviser in the Trump administration said, "It was not a novel. It was the world we were living."
   
 Bossier, who is now an ABC News contributor, said Bush did not just insist on preparation for a pandemic. He was obsessed with it.
   
 "He was completely taken by the reality that that was going to happen," said Bossert.
   
 In a November 2005 speech at the National Institutes of Health, Bush laid out proposals down to the most minute detail. He described with stunning precision how a pandemic in the United States would unfold. Among those in the audience was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leader of this current crisis response, who was then and still is now the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   
 At the time Bush said, "A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire. If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond out ability to control it."
   
 President Bush recognized that an outbreak was a different kind of disaster than the ones the federal government had been designed to address.
   
 "To respond to a pandemic, we need medical personnel and adequate supplies of equipment," said President Bush. "In a pandemic, everything from syringes to hospital beds, respirators, masks and protective equipment would be in short supply."
   
 Bush told the gathered scientists they would would need to develop a vaccine in record time.
   
 "If a pandemic strikes, our country must have a surge capacity in place that will allow us to bring a new vaccine on line quickly and manufacture enough to immunize every American against the pandemic strain," said Bush.
   
 The government launched a website, www.pandemicflu.gov, that is still in use today.
   
 As time passed, however, it became increasingly difficult to justify the continued funding, staffing and attention.
   
 Bush was asked to comment on the current COVID-19 pandemic, which he perfectly described in 2005, however he declined.
   
 I'm sure he takes no pleasure in being right.
   
 The mistakes that were made, can't be dwelled on, those in charge NEED to focus on the here and now and what they're going to do for US.
   
 The bi-partisan politics has to be the first thing to go.
   
 People are dying while Republicans are fighting Democrats and vice-versa.
   
 And our governor, who, admittedly, I've never been a fan, is sucking the life out of this State, in my opinion.
   
 I, like a lot of other hardworking Illinoisans, are being taxed beyond what is reasonable.
   
 I truly feel as though he's focused more on his aspirations for the office of President of the United States in 2024 rather than what's happening to his constituents at this point.
   
 He's never had to live paycheck-to-paycheck. He's never had to worry about buying groceries or buying much needed medication. That's an issue with a lot of politicians these days. They are so out of touch with the average working person they have no idea; that and the contributions they take from lobbyists which makes them beholden to those creations.
   
 Nothing is 'normal' at this point.
   
 As a society, we're going to have to be willing to do our part to get back to whatever our new normal is going to be.
   
 There is already too much fighting going on and fighting isn't going to solve anything at this point--people are going to continue to die, continue to spread the virus, continue to not take it seriously, etc.
   
 Throughout history our country has asked A LOT more of our ancestors and they gladly stepped up to the plate--fought wars, defended our freedoms, died for our country and more yet, here some of us are with the latest iPhone, getting our medical information from social media, which must be true because, you know, it's social media, then sharing said information all the while complaining about wearing a freakin' MASK.
   
 I don't want to wear one. I'm pretty sure no one is jumping for joy over it, but it's just something we do to help our fellow human being.
   
 If it turns out to be bunk, so what?
   
 What have you really lost?
   
 Nothing.
   
 You can brag all over social media how right you were--there's something to look forward to!
   
 If it turns out to be true--you did your part.
   
 It really is not that difficult of a decision.
   
 I'm sure one of your ancestors who took a bullet in the back at Gettysburg is looking down from Heaven and is extremely proud of you for doing the right thing and wearing a mask.

“It wasn't the (activism) that stood out for us, it was that he grew up in the outdoors,” Boyle said. “His favorite activities to do outside the track is photography, hiking, biking, golf — it's just a natural fit.”
 Columbia is an established brand in active outdoor lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment. It plans to use the deal with Wallace — its first NASCAR driver and team sponsorship agreement — to promote its product lines.
 Finding sponsorship has been difficult during Wallace's career. He joined RPM, co-owned by Hall of Famer Richard Petty, in 2017 but a lack of proper funding has long slowed the team on the track. Wallace began this season with only 16 of 36 races sold to corporate sponsors.
 It has taken time for deals to come together in the months since Wallace found his voice. He signed a personal sponsorship agreement with Beats by Dre in July, a deal announced ahead of schedule when the company responded to President Donald Trump targeting Wallace in a tweet.
 One week later, Cash App signed on to sponsor Wallace for five races.
 “It's just incredible momentum that we have right now,” Wallace told AP. “These are the types of deals that we've always talked about that we needed to be successful on and off the race track.”

Four student summer employees at SEAWA were honored recently with a small order-in pizza lunch in the SEAWA Gallery at the Arcade Plaza on Third Street in Downtown Medicine Hat.
 The students were employed this summer to further the riparian restoration projects started by SEAWA three years ago. Three of the students leave mid- August to return to their studies in environmental sciences.
 It's been a hectic summer, just like the previous summers, primarily taking care of 900 shrubs and trees to keep them alive and thriving in the challenging conditions of a semi-arid climate. Plant care work consisted of weekly watering (but twice a week during a heat warning period), twice a week hand-weeding close to the plants and motorized weeding farther away from plants, installation of plant protection cages, application of wood chip mulch, and spraying of organic fungicides.

I’ve spent hours and hours in this place, changing perspectives once in a while and just taking it all in. It’s the most peaceful man-made place that I know. And you can’t really pull it apart: it’s not really a building—it’s just a few walls and a roof with pools, a statue, and a chair. There’s not much else going on—with Mies van der Rohe being a minimalist. But every detail is perfect.
