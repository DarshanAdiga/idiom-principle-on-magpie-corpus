Prices of the WTI met sellers above the $46.00 mark. Demand concerns re-emerge and weigh on sentiment. The EIA reported US crude supplies dropped by 0.754M last week. After hitting fresh 8-month peaks above the $46.00 mark, prices of the barrel of WTI ease some ground on the back of profit taking and the resumptions of demand concerns on Thursday. WTI meets resistance just beyond $46.00 Prices of the barrel of West Texas Intermediate retreat for the first time after six daily advances in a row. In fact, the knee-jerk in prices follow some profit taking in light of the strong monthly gains, while jitters resurfaced regarding crude oil demand amidst the unabated advance of the pandemic. Earlier in the week, the EIA reported a drop of around 750K barrels in US crude oil supplies during last week, in line with the decrease in oil inventories reported late on Tuesday by the API. Further data from driller Baker Hughes showed US oil rig count went up by 10 during last week to 241 active oil rigs. Despite the ongoing correction, the WTI closed with gains in every week of the current month, gaining around 37% since lows in the sub-$34.00 area on November 1. WTI significant levels At the moment the barrel of WTI is down 1.30% at $45.26 and a breach of $43.04 (high Nov.11) would aim to $40.12 (weekly low Nov.16) and then $37.09 (low Nov.6). On the other hand, the next hurdle aligns at $46.24 (monthly high Nov.25) seconded $48.39 (monthly high Mar.4) and finally $54.45 (monthly high Feb.20).

"It is important to be on the right side of a market trend, it is equally important to book profits at regular intervals and re-enter on dips or corrections," said Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Index Trader and Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal Investments. "The fear that markets might turn at higher levels and see a sharp fall thereafter forces people to unwind their positions when we have a gap up opening or witness a newer high. This happened on Wednesday when the Nifty corrected over 200 points from the day's high. While the trend continues to remain positive and the underlying current is fiercely bullish, traders would like to err on the side of caution and book profits at regular slated intervals."

In his desperate insecurity Gordon Brown famously cussed and threw mobile phones all over the place. Cabinet secretary, Gus O’Donnell, had to take himself aside and warn him not to shout at junior officials. Yet Brown stayed in post until the election. So best not to throw stones too large or too hard at Patel. She will fall for other reasons.

Not many. The Times, the Guardian and Observer, the Sunday Times, occasionally the BBC, FT and Mail. To add insult to injury the private outsourcers preferred instead of the NHS and university networks have got away with calling it “NHS Test and Trace”. NHS is a more trusted brand than Serco.

The municipality of Pala, traditionally a United Democratic Front (UDF) bastion, has become electorally significant over decades not because of itself, but as a showcase of the Kerala Congress’s power.
 During the previous local body elections, the Kerala Congress (M) contested in as many as 20 out of the 26 seats here and won 17. But as the civic body is set to elect a new council next month, the schism in the regional party and the consequent emergence of an alternative political force in the rubber heartland, has put it at the centre of a high-stakes battle.
 With the Jose K. Mani group fielding candidates in 16 wards and P.J. Joseph group in 13, the municipality has become the stage for a direct clash between the splinter groups that were fighting hard to claim the legacy of K.M. Mani — the KC(M) patriarch. Among these, they have squared up to each other in seven wards, including Munnani where two potential chairman candidates — Kuriakose Padavan of the UDF and Anto Padinjarekkara of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) — are fighting each other.
 ## Consolidating position
 A victory will help the respective KC(M) side stabilise its position within the coalition while also showing the other as weak and inconsequential.
 As the contest with respect to the legacy of the KC(M) settled in its favour for the time being, the Mani group that contests under the party symbol ‘two leaves’ has the initial edge. But the UDF too has put up a united front, keen not to lose its position as the traditional favourite.
 The Congress, meanwhile, is the biggest gainer as it contests from 13 seats this time as against six in 2015. The CPI(M), on the other hand, has given up as many as eight seats to accommodate the Mani group.
 “The voters of Pala, who are perdominantly pro-UDF, have a clear understanding on the circumstances that led to the loss of the ‘two leaves’ symbol,” explained Mr. Padavan, a Joseph group strongman. He also exuded confidence over the coalition romping home once again on the back of a slew of welfare and development projects implemented by the previous council.
 The Mani group, on the other hand, regards itself to be in an advantageous situation with the support of the Left coalition, which currently holds the Assembly constituency, including the Pala municipality. “The re-alignment move will only help raise our vote-share while the High Court order allotting the party symbol has given us the initial push,” said Sunny Thekkedam, district president of the KC(M) Mani group.
 Meanwhile, both the coalitions cannot afford to ignore the presence of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is out to prove a point in at least a couple of wards. Though the party had won a seat in the previous council, the councillor later switched sides to the LDF.

Not many people probably had a bet on Stoke City to get promoted to the Premier League in 2008, and those that did would have earned a tidy profit. I am a Stoke fan because this is where my father is from, and I actually did have a bet on Stoke to get promoted that year. After the game that sealed our promotion, I spoke to my father on the phone and he revealed that he also placed a €20 bet on Stoke to be promoted at the start of the season – he had just won €100 profit. I on the other hand, only made an €85 profit. When I asked him where he got such good odds from, he told me that a friend of his had told him about a bookmaker comparison site called betinireland.ie. When I hung up, I immediately checked it out, and it has gone on to help me a lot as I now get much better odds than I did before.
