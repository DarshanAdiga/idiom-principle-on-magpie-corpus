To coordinate innovation activities, the National Economic Council could establish an innovation office, geared toward facilitating interagency, public-private, and international communication and coordination on matters of innovation, as guided by the principles listed above.13As addressed elsewhere in this article, the executive branch has a unique capacity to facilitate information sharing and deconflict projects across public, private, and international domains. The same official in charge of the economic statecraft office at the National Security Council could lead this office as well. By wearing two hats, this person would be responsible for ensuring innovation and statecraft activities work in tandem.

The World Health Organization named leaders of an independent panel to review its response to the Covid-19 pandemic that has been criticized by the US.
 Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia, were selected as co-chairs, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a meeting with member-states. The panel will present an interim report in November.

 WHO has come under fire for its response to the coronavirus outbreak from President Donald Trump who is pulling the US out of the global group, saying that it's too close to China. Tedros has responded that the agency acted appropriately with the information it had and the rest of the world had plenty of time to prepare to fight the outbreak.
 Clark and Johnson Sirleaf, who were chosen in consultation with experts and member countries, will pick the rest of the committee, Tedros said. He suggested that in addition to the interim report, the panel will provide monthly updates. The panel will review the international response to the pandemic, including that of the WHO. The full report is expected in May.
 "It's time for a very honest reflection," Tedros said in the meeting. "All of us must look in the mirror. The WHO, every member state, all involved in the response, everyone. Are we ready to learn the big lessons?"

Equal parts cream and yogurt, and then some lime juice and some salt. Whisk it all together, let it sit, and in the case that you're using all nondairy products, then you hope for the best, which is what I will be doing. Really, it should sit for at least two hours, probably max 12, but I'm, like, trying to get these dumplings done, so I'm gonna let this sit for two hours, and the reason that I know it's kind of close to where I want it anyway is because when I take my spoon and I scoop up some crema and I draw a figure eight on it, it holds on top. So, it doesn't just, like, sink back into itself, so, it's… good enough for now. And so I just really want, I think, enough of this so that it gives the pastrami mix, like, a little bit of a stick to it so that I can make it more of a paste.

I had hoped Aaron Schneider’s “Greyhound” would be a thrilling WWII epic, buoyed by strong performances, rich production values and the best modern special effects to bring this seagoing battle film to life. I wasn’t disappointed on any of these counts.
 But what I hadn’t anticipated was that the film would have me longing and envious for not having experienced a seemingly simpler time populated by morally honorable men who were able to put their differences aside in order to unite against a common threat.
 Set in early 1942, Commander Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) has been assigned an unenviable task; he is to shepherd a convoy of ships across the North Atlantic that contains vital supplies necessary for the growing Allied war effort. Nearly 100 seacraft are his responsibility, and he faces an array of dire challenges. The weather is bitter, cold and cruel, they are being pursued by a small, dogged group of Nazi U-boats, and there is a 50-hour period in which they will be stuck in the Black Pit, a remote stretch of the ocean where the convoy will be at its most vulnerable without air cover. That this is Krause’s first crossing seems a minor consideration in light of all the other challenges.
 The script, adapted by Hanks from the novel “The Good Shepherd” by C.S. Forester, is lean and straightforward, reflective of the films from the World War II era in that it wastes little time in setting up the basic premise, introducing the characters and rapidly progressing from one dire event to the next, relentlessly increasing the tension as the stakes rise. Schneider does a masterful job of steadily building the suspense throughout, taking a page from the Steven Spielberg playbook where the primary threat of the film is concerned.

BARABOO, Wis. (WMTV/Gray News) - The search for a missing 10-year-old Wisconsin girl came to a tragic end late Tuesday morning when her body was discovered in a rural farm area, not far from her home.According to the Baraboo Police Department, Kodie B. Dutcher was found dead in a field near County Hwy. T and 12th Street, which is less than a mile from her home.An Amber Alert was issued for her after she was last seen Monday afternoon.An initial search of her home turned up indications that Kodie may have been threatening to harm herself. A spokesperson for the Baraboo Police Department, Lt. Ryan La Broscian, could not confirm if the pills the family believes Kodie took had anything to do with the cause of her death.“I didn’t know the little girl, but [she was] right across the street,” said Jennifer Dominguez through tears. “I have a 9-year-old, who plays here, a granddaughter. I feel so sad for this family. I can’t even imagine what they’re going through.”Officers, joined by members of the Baraboo Fire Dept. and the Wisconsin Dells K-9 force, immediately began searching the area around the apartment complex and were later aided by drone teams from the Sauk Co. Sheriff’s Office and Middleton Fire Dept.On Tuesday, with the help of scores of volunteers who came to help out in the effort, searchers started a secondary search of the immediate area.“If my kid were lost, I would want somebody else to out there looking for them,” said Baraboo search volunteer, Shawn Hulett.During a news conference earlier Tuesday, La Broscian said Kodie and her family moved to Wisconsin in April, and she was only in school for about two weeks before the coronavirus pandemic forced classes to be canceled. Her mom told police that, “Kodie was happy here,” and even mentioned she was looking forward to a camping trip.La Broscian noted that Kodie had a Snapchat account, but there was nothing out of the ordinary posted to it and nothing has been uploaded since the time she disappeared. Previously, authorities had noted that Kodie had left her cell phone and shoes at home.Copyright 2020 WMTV via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

“The eventual return of employees to their jobs was not unexpected, but the speed of the return may have caught forecasters off guard,” Varner wrote.
 The May boom was followed by a June explosion, a gain of 4.8 million jobs.
 As good as that news is, it’s important to keep it in perspective. The jobs gain of 7.3 million jobs in May/June still doesn’t come close to equaling the loss of 20 million jobs in April.
 “(The improved numbers do) not mean that the economy is in a good place or could not tumble further. The economy remains well below its peak,” Varner wrote.
 Why is that? For one obvious reason: The pandemic and the economy are inextricably linked. If efforts to control the pandemic fall short of hopes and expectations, so will the economy.
 More ominously, circumstances can change in a hurry.
 Before the pandemic hit, 6.13 million Illinoisans were working. By April, the payroll numbers dropped to 5.32 million.
 Not only is that devastating to the individuals who lost their jobs, it’s cataclysmic for units of government that depend on the taxes those workers pay to fund public services.
 The state’s overall decline of $1.1 billion in revenue from the 2019 Fiscal Year to the 2020 Fiscal Year is just one manifestation of a nationwide problem that has stricken government at all levels.
 That’s why the good news cited by Varner isn’t as good as everyone would like it to be.
 The national and state economy is slowly being opened, too fast for some and too slow for others. But further progress is not guaranteed because, Varner said, “threats associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continue to weigh on the economy.”
 So there it is. News on the nation and state’s economic recovery isn’t as good as it can get. But it’s as good as it is going to get as long as the threat posed by the coronavirus hangs over people’s heads.

The announcement follows strong criticism by US President Donald Trump's administration, which accused the WHO of being "China-centric", and US formal notification on Tuesday that it was withdrawing from the UN agency in a year's time.
 Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf have agreed to head the panel and chose its members, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual meeting with representatives of WHO's 194 member states, which was webcast.
 "This is not a standard report that ticks a box and is then put on a shelf to gather dust. This is something we take seriously," Tedros said, adding that the panel would provide an interim report to an annual meeting of health ministers being reconvened in November.
 Clark, addressing the meeting, said that the assignment "could only be described as exceptionally challenging".
 Tedros noted that in May, WHO's member states adopted unanimously a resolution put forward by the European Union calling for an evaluation of the global response to the pandemic.
 More than 12 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 548,429​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.

We remain mindful of the risks inherent to innovation policy. Close public- private partnerships can become politicized, introducing cronyism and preferential investment. But those risks, and the potential for inefficient capital allocation, can be mitigated somewhat through clear decision criteria, transparency, and oversight. However, risk does come with the territory. If the government wants to create a step change in U.S. innovation, it will have to expect and, more importantly, accept failure, as any entrepreneur can attest. Congress will have to give research and development projects some freedom to fail and learn from those failures, and the government will have to enforce ethics accountability. It will also need to ensure America has the human capital necessary to support continued innovation and dynamism.
