Life goes on. Over the years, we moved, and the house on North White Street was bought and sold several times. The tree remained, a proud symbol of strength and vitality.
 That is, until May 14 of this year. At 9:30 p.m., Mario Carapia Ruiz was getting ready for bed. It had been a rainy day. There was a loud explosion that rocked the house. His wife, Viridiana, and two sons, gathered in the living room, wondering what happened. There was a knock at the front door. It was a neighbor. “Hey, your tree has been hit by lightening! There are branches all over the street. The explosion knocked pictures off the wall at our house.”
 The police were called and, once again, Bill Maddy of Maddy’s tree service was summoned. He informed Mario that the tree had to come down. Mario agreed. They were lucky to be alive. Maddy’s Tree Service was awarded the job.
 A stump that measures 9 feet across is now the only remnant of the once stately tree. A hollow trunk revealed its weakness.
 I have a pine cone from that tree. It sits on our windowsill, a reminder that nothing is too big to fall.

Zuckerberg has been coming under fire in recent days for his inaction on several Trump posts after Twitter fact-checked one of the same posts and slapped another with a warning saying it violated its rules against glorifying violence. Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout on Monday over Zuckerberg's policy towards Trump's posts, and some have resigned. Facebook "is on the wrong side of history," one staffer wrote in a resignation post.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional.
 From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets.
 But the deadlines aren't hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest.
 A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations.
 New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down.
 “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said.

Although we don’t know yet, the EU may follow suit. The EU and especially Germany has previously tried to balance in the US-China conflict, to put its own economic interests first, but now most Western governments are lining up in a rather loose and internally conflicted anti-China bloc. This is not just over Hong Kong but also other issues like Huawei and technology. They are blocking Chinese companies from taking over companies in the EU. The pandemic has pushed other capitalist governments closer to the US position that China needs to be contained, pushed back. Historically such imperialist conflicts have usually led to war. This time it is economic warfare.

But the pandemic-driven shutdown turned Zoom into a tool for employees who once worked alongside each other, but have been doing their jobs from home during the past few months.
 Zoom ended April with 265,400 corporate customers with at least 10 employees, more than quadrupling from the same time last year.
 Although Zoom remains focused on servicing its corporate customers, Yuan is hoping to figure out ways to make money from the all the socializing and learning that is happening on the service, too. Some analysts have speculated that eventually may involve showing ads on the free version of Zoom, although the company hasn’t given any indication it will do that.
 If it hopes to continue to expand, Zoom also will also will likely have to do a better job of protecting the privacy of its video conferences. To help achieve that goal, Yuan has been consulting since April with Alex Stamos, a highly respected online security expert who previously worked at Yahoo and Facebook. Both those companies encountered their only security and privacy problems, too.
 Zoom’s success is also drawing stiffer competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook.

There was an explosion, followed by a crackling. The hair on the back of my head stood up. I was in the basement, working on my laptop computer. My son, in the next room, hollered, “What was that?!”
 We went upstairs, where my family was gathering, and looked out into the front yard. Tree bark littered the ground.
 The year was 1995. It was an overcast Sunday afternoon, the air heavy with humidity. Lightening had struck the 110’ tall Norway Spruce that was in our front yard on North White Street in Mt. Pleasant. It was a registered tree, the second tallest Norway Spruce in Iowa. We called Bill Maddy of Maddy’s Tree Service. Mr. Maddy came right over. He inspected the mammoth tree. There was an ugly lightening gash that swirled around the trunk of the tree from top to bottom. All the pine cones were blown off.
