However, this tweet is a bit confusing. Because what she's retweeting is someone pointing out that _Wonder Woman 1984_ will be arriving simultaneously in theaters and on streaming. And even though she says "Correct," about the tweet in question, in the same breath, she definitively says "direct to streaming is not even being discussed." So what's the deal here?

“What we’re doing is bringing a new industry straight to the place where West Virginians once mined,” said Jay Walder, CEO of Virgin Hyperloop One, at an announcement with the governor and state’s U.S. senators.
 Missouri had hoped to land the project for an ultrafast Hyperloop track that would transport passengers between St. Louis and Kansas City in 30 minutes. State lawmakers earlier this year passed a bill that would give the Missouri Highways and Transportation Committee the authority to form a public-private partnership to build it.
 Delaware, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Washington state were also in the running for the facility, according to a Virgin Hyperloop news release.
 The company did not say if any financial incentives were offered in West Virginia’s proposal. Mike Schneider, a vice president at Virgin Hyperloop, said the company was not “looking for gigantic tax breaks.” A spokeswoman said that the project is expected to be financed by private and public funds.

Nate gave a shout out to HK47 from Knights Of The Old Republic, obviously. KOTOR is one of our best RPGs and best ever PC games of all time. There was a fan remake in the works before it got shitcanned by lawyers, but earlier this year there were rumours that EA are going to dip their toes back in the KOTOR water. I'm suspicious of that, though, since KOTOR is technically part of the Star Wars universe that no longer exists after the Disney retcon.

I did struggle to understand how a lot of these Winamp skins even work (did we really just memorise all the button locations?) and would go spare if my dayjob involved twiddling digital chrome dials on fake wooden panels. But I will confess I have put a big, distracting photo of a forest on a critical piece of RPS collaboration software, because I like the picture.

_" Niente di nuovo sotto il sole di Napoli, nel senso che quello che a più riprese ho sostenuto lo rispiego. Parlo a nome mio e non a nome della FIGC. Le considerazioni sono assolutamente chiarissime. Secondo me, in questo momento, non si sta facendo altro che alzare del gran polverone - perché il caso c'è stato ed è eclatante - con comportamenti poco chiari. Poco chiaro perché si è voluto a tutti i costi affermare un principio in cui la legge la faceva il protocollo. Non tenendo però presente che il protocollo ha mostrato delle lacune. Ci sarebbe da dire che, con questo COVID-19 che sta avendo una recrudescenza preoccupante, è stata fatta una scelta: quella di gestire le situazioni. Si è deciso di gestirla facendo prevalere il protocollo ma evidentemente c'è stata una mancanza"._

There’s nothing casual about Wright’s songwriting, however. Craft and care are reflected in the way he packs clever rhymes and wordplay into concise tunes. The set is half an hour long, and one song — the delightful “I’d Be Good” — runs a minute.
 Wright’s last album, 2018’s “Dust,” was filled with compelling dark dramas, and not everything here goes for a grin. The love song “Sure Wanna Stay” and the topical “Wonder If the World Can Wait That Long” showcase his yearning tenor.
 But Wright sings with tongue in cheek — a nifty trick — about logic, losing at love, cash flow woes and, on “Rhymes With Bucket,” a philosophy for life. He offers a tonic for a pandemic on “Cheer Up,” singing, “Probably going to be here awhile — smile.” This album can help us do just that.
