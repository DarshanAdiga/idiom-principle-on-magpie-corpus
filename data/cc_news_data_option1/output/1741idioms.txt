The news of the positive tests is unfortunate timing given that the league is hoping to get the green light to resume from Chancellor Angela Merkel's federal government on Wednesday.

Releasing some prisoners early -- which could include elderly inmates eligible for parole, people close to finishing their sentences or those who have already been granted parole but are still behind bars -- is a decision that falls to Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, but neither has indicated any plans to do so.

BARNES: Yeah, absolutely. Particularly with _Shadow and Bone_ , it’s something where I was like, “I would love to do this, but it would be great if I could be involved in how this character comes across.” I’ve been involved in the production of a couple of the smaller films that I’ve done, like _By the Gun_ , and things like that, but I’m definitely now moving towards that area. As you go on in your career, you want different things. You want your stories to have a point to them, and you might want to work in a particular genre or tell a particular story, which you feel there aren’t enough of now, or something like that. It’s just having some semblance of control, which you never really feel like you necessarily have, as an actor. So, I’m started to look at books and short stories, and things like that, which I read and I’m nudging towards trying to get made. That’s a very difficult realm to get into, but I’ve definitely always got my eye out for stuff, which might feel right for me. I do really enjoy that part of it. I’ve done some writing, but I’ve never particularly felt like a from scratch ideas person. I did an English literature degree, and I feel like that critical analysis part of my brain is something which I’ve been honing for the last 20 years, so I just would love to use it, as much as I can, to help make the best versions of things.

The new coronavirus is fully entrenched in the Texas prison system, confirmed to have infected more than 1,600 inmates and employees at dozens of units. At least 25 infected prisoners and staff members have died. But, like in the rest of the state, the scope of the virus' spread behind bars is still largely unknown because testing has been limited.
