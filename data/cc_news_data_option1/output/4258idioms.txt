SPRINGFIELD - Two more of the 11 regions of the state's COVID-19 mitigation plan have reached a threshold necessitating increased restrictions, joining two other regions which remain above the key metric.
   
 Will and Kankakee counties in Region 7 and DuPage and Kane counties in Region 8 will be closed for indoor service at bars and restaurants and will see capacity limits of 25 people or 25 percent of maximum occupancy among other restrictions. The mitigations will take effect Friday.
   
 "Numbers throughout most of the regions are trending in the wrong direction," Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said at a news conference Tuesday in Chicago. "If your region does have the implemented mitigation measures, please, let's get on board and help our community to get back on track. It's been done before - we did it together as a state to get to Phase 4 (of the state's reopening plan). Let's do what we can to progress further."
   
 She encouraged Illinoisans to get a flu shot to avoid further stresses on hospital systems, wear a face covering, keep a six-foot distance from others, wash hands regularly and keep to smaller groups.
   
 The governor and health officials announced the mitigations as COVID-19 positivity rates remained on an upward arc in every region, including Region 1 of the reopening plan. That region, from Winnebago County to the state's western border in northern Illinois, hit an 11.8 percent positivity rate - a new high - after its second week of increased mitigations.
   
 Region 7 previously had mitigations in place from Aug. 27 to Sept. 18 after rising above 8 percent on Aug. 19 then falling to 5.2 percent on Sept. 28. After that, the rates began increasing in the region and statewide.
   
 Asked why bars and restaurants continue to be hardest hit by economic restrictions, Ezike said they remain a key venue of spread, according to contact tracing efforts.
   
 "When you look at the top three places that come up over and over, region to region statewide, it comes up as people's workplace, it comes up as school, it comes up as restaurants and bars," she said. "So we're not going to not have people go to school - we're letting the local health departments and the school administrators decide for themselves what's appropriate regarding school. And then in terms of workplace, there are people that… cannot work for home.... So the next thing that we can actually act on is the bars and restaurants."
   
 Gov. JB Pritzker said guidance previously provided to schools by the Illinois State Board of Education should continue to be followed. That requires masking and six feet of distance.
   
 Existing guidance for high school and recreational sports also remains in effect, while Pritzker said "we are going to be very careful about whatever guidance gets issued for school sports for the winter."
   
 The governor also said he is not considering a statewide stay-at-home order.
   
 The regions that will be subject to greater mitigations by the end of the week include 33 counties and more than a quarter of the state's population. Other mitigations include a ban on party buses and closure of casinos and gambling venues at 11 p.m., among others.
   
 Region 5 in southern Illinois, which will see increased mitigations starting Thursday, remained above the mitigation threshold at an 8.5 percent rolling positivity rate, decreasing from 9.1 percent the two days prior. Any region must remain below 6.5 percent for three days to have mitigations lifted.
   
 Three other regions - Region 3 at 7.5 percent in west-central Illinois, Region 6 at 7.6 percent in east-central Illinois and Region 9 in northern suburban Lake and McHenry counties at 7.5 percent - are all within a half point of the mitigation threshold after increasing, according to Tuesday's data.
   
 Region 4 in the Metro East area on the Missouri border increased to 7.4 percent, Region 10 in suburban Cook County increased to 7.1 percent and Region 11, which consists of only Chicago, had the lowest positivity rate at 6.7 percent. Region 2, which includes Peoria and several surrounding counties, remained level from the day before at 6.9 percent, while Region 6 in east- central Illinois has been flat at 7.6 percent for four days.
   
 On Tuesday, the state reported another 3,714 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 among 59,077 test results reported. Another 41 COVID-19 individuals died over the previous 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 9,277 since the pandemic began.
   
 The statewide COVID-19 test positivity rate crept upward for the 16th straight day Tuesday, hitting 5.6 percent as the metric once again pushes levels not seen since June.
   
 Hospitalizations also continue to increase, with ventilator usage jumping by 9 percent overnight as 195 ventilators were in use by COVID-19 patients as of Monday evening. While that left 77 percent of ventilators unused across the state, it's the highest COVID-19 usage of the machines recorded in a single day since June 26.
   
 Hospital bed usage by COVID-19 patients jumped 8 percent overnight to 2,261, and the number of intensive care beds in use by COVID-19 patients jumped by four to 489. That left 37 percent of beds and 39 percent of ICU beds available statewide.

Where the film does excel is in its two leads. The couple Jack and Su, played by John Paul Reynolds and Sunita “Su” Mani, respectively, are fantastic together. The two have great chemistry, but the film also makes it clear that they have some work to do on their relationship. The characters feel real, and each has their own distinct personality and interests. Su is the planner and realistic thinker, while Jack is lazier and more content to sit back and relax. This dynamic is effectively explored as the film progresses and Jack and Su’s relationship is simultaneously strained and strengthened by the ultimate test of survival. Reynolds and Mani play their roles to near- perfection. Mani specifically is the backbone of the film.
 The film is a comedy, but it employs its humor in a way that’ll leave audiences quietly chuckling more than laughing out loud. The couple spends the first half of the film unaware of the alien invasion, and the movie uses their ignorance as a source of humor. The second half relies mostly on the fish-out- of-water scenario that arises when the two hipsters get stuck in the woods with no technology. The film is funny, but not hilarious.
 Overall, “Save Yourselves!” is a humorous film with a good heart. Flaws aside, it is evident this indie comedy was made with a whole lot of passion and love. Some of that earnestness bleeds through into the film, making it into an imminently enjoyable experience. The film isn’t great, but Jack and Su are delightful enough to make spending an hour and a half with them worthwhile.

But the service struggled to reach viewers, despite a 90-day free trial, as short videos abound on the internet and the coronavirus pandemic kept many people at home.

What we can't do, though, is let COVID-19 take us by surprise as it did last spring. This season gives us, as winter sports enthusiasts, the opportunity to prove both on and off the mountain that we're not just in it for personal thrill.

The Commission, nonetheless, brought two claims premising on a violation of the freedom of establishment and of the freedom to provide services respectively. Whereas this may be criticised as shadow boxing, the Commission’s infringement proceedings challenged Hungary’s reform _in toto_ and therefore could not have been limited to the case of the CEU.

BOISE — Boise State athletic director Curt Apsey is leaving his role and will be reassigned to a university-level fundraising position.
 Senior associate athletic director Bob Carney will serve as interim athletic director as a national search is conducted for Apsey’s replacement.
 Boise State made the surprising news Wednesday in a press release.
 “It has been a privilege for me to be a part of Boise State Athletics for the past 21 years, both as an athletic director and senior level administrator,” Apsey said in a statement.
 “I will be stepping away from the duties of athletic director and focusing my energy on the financial challenges we currently face by continuing to advance our fundraising efforts at Boise State.”
 The Boise State athletics department is facing big budget issues stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. A shortened football season — and one without fans in the stands — is leaving the department with significant losses.
 The baseball and swimming and diving teams were disbanded in July because of budget shortfalls, and the department implemented furloughs and salary reductions this fall.
 Apsey had less than a year remaining on his contract. He initially signed a five-year agreement when he arrived at Boise State 2015 and had one year added to that in February 2019. His deal was set to expire in June 2021.
 It appears telling that Boise State president Dr. Marlene Tromp, who has been on the job just 16 months, had yet to give him a contract extension with the end of the deal approaching.
 The timing of the announcement also somewhat is odd, given the first football game is just three days away.
 Many other factors including the move to a newly created fundraising position would suggest this was not solely Apsey’s decision. A prominent Boise State booster told the Idaho Press on Wednesday “this has been in the works” because, in part, “a lot of of donors and coaches are frustrated with him. No vision.”
 Asked how long he knew the changes were coming, Carney said, “I don’t know that the timeline is important as part of this conversation today.”
 Apsey started at Boise State in 1998 as a senior associate athletic director and was responsible for the fundraising and completion of several new athletic facilities and improvements. According to Boise State, that list includes the Caven-Williams Indoor Sports Complex ($10 million, 2006), the Stueckle Sky Center ($37 million, 2008), the Arguinchona Basketball Complex ($3 million, 2011) and the Bleymaier Football Center ($22 million, 2013).
 He left to become the athletic director at Carroll College for the 2014-15 season before returning as athletic director in 2015.
 Apsey recently was honored as a finalist for the Sports Business Journal’s athletic director of the year. Under his leadership, Boise State finished as the top athletic department from a Group of Five school in the Learfield IMG College Directors’ Cup in each of the two years before the pandemic.
 “On behalf of our entire Boise State University community, I want to thank Curt Apsey for the tremendous role that he has played in helping our student- athletes achieve unparalleled successes over the past five years,” Dr. Tromp said in a statement. “In this new role, he will continue to work on behalf of our athletics department but also can put his tremendous skill set to work for our entire university during this critical time.”
 One potential candidate is senior associate athletic director and football chief of staff Brad Larrondo. Sources said he has strong support from boosters after being in various roles with the athletic department since 1993.
 Carney, who has held various roles with the athletic department since 2005, declined to say whether he hoped to be a candidate for the job.
 “Right now, as mentioned, it’s going to be a national search for the position and that will be the focus, to be supporting the University and trying to help (it) find the best person for the job and we’re not sure who that’s going to be at this time,” Carney said.
 Carney was promoted to his current role of senior associate athletic director for strategic planning and capital projects in July 2018. He has a bachelor’s degree in business administration and a master’s in athletic leadership from Boise State.
 “It’s definitely a challenging time to step in, but I’m excited to take on this opportunity and the challenges,” Carney said. “One of my goals was to be a Division I athletic director, so it’s a great opportunity to sit in that chair and get a good feel for it and learn from it.
 “It’s definitely been a goal of mine for the last four or five years so it’s kind of a bittersweet opportunity because I’m friends with Curt and appreciate all he’s done, but at the same time I’m excited for it. It’s a challenging time, but I think I’m up for the challenge.”
 A text message to Apsey seeking additional comment was not returned. Tromp also was not available for additional comment.
 “I am extremely grateful to have been able to work with such incredible people while serving our amazing student-athletes that wore the Blue and Orange,” Apsey added in the statement. “I want to thank each of them for being so committed to the student-athlete experience both academically and athletically. With Dr. Tromp’s leadership and the University administration’s commitment to innovation and growth, Boise State and Bronco Athletics will continue to rise to the next level.”

“Save Yourselves!” is a new indie comedy written and directed by Alex Huston Fischer and Eleanor Wilson. The film follows a hipster millennial couple as they take a weeklong technology-free vacation at a remote cabin in the woods. Unfortunately for them, their plans to relax and better themselves are interrupted by a global invasion of cute, yet deadly, aliens.
 “Save Yourselves!” is a slow burning film. Its sparse plot is drawn out and its humor is subdued. The extent of the alien threat isn’t fully revealed until halfway through the film, and the action doesn’t pick up speed until it’s nearly over. Instead, the film keeps an intent focus on its two main characters, using the premise of alien invasion to explore their relationship.
 As the pair tries desperately to survive in an unfamiliar place without the internet or any people around to guide them, they come to realize some hard truths about themselves and their lifestyle. But they also come to realize how much they mean to each other.
 All things considered, this film isn’t particularly well put together. The plot feels very drawn out, and not enough happens to make the film’s short one-hour, 33-minute runtime feel justified. The story also feels a tad off- the-wall, with certain events going unexplained or coming out of nowhere. If you’re expecting a suspenseful disaster film or a meticulous sci-fi alien invasion backstory, this film is not for you.

The fruits in this dark, agreeably chunky wine from Pauillac are just beginning to soften and surrender a little meaty fullness on the nose, while the palate is deep, earthy, close-textured and satisfying. The tannins will continue to soften for another half-decade, and the wine will continue to offer ample knife-and-fork pleasure as they do so.

Bloomberg) -- The U.S. monopoly case against Alphabet Inc.’s Google is likely to trigger an onslaught of private antitrust lawsuits riding on the allegations in the government’s complaint.
 The deluge of litigation has the potential to force the search giant to pay billions of dollars in settlements, according to legal experts.
 The Justice Department’s case filed Tuesday will be “followed by a wave of private cases,” said Patrick J. Coughlin, a lawyer who has represented consumers in class actions against companies such as Apple Inc., Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. “Every antitrust law firm in the country will be involved in some way or another.”
 The parties in a 2005 class action lawsuit over MasterCard’s and Visa’s swipe fees, which included 12 million merchants, settled for $5 billion, noted Coughlin, who was involved in the case, parts of which are still on appeal.
 In addition to the legal resources Google will have to muster to defend the cases, they can be financially onerous because antitrust laws allow private parties to recover triple damages if they prevail. The complaints likely will be filed in venues scattered across the nation and many will eventually be consolidated into a single case before one judge, experts said.
 “Within a week, there’ll be a hundred private cases filed,” Coughlin said. “There’s no waiting.”
 Google, which controls about 90% of the online search market in the country, is now facing the biggest U.S. monopolization complaint since the government sued Microsoft Corp. more than 20 years ago. The Justice Department, which was joined by 11 Republican state attorneys general, alleged that Google paid billions of dollars for exclusive deals with mobile phone-makers and wireless providers to dominate search and lock out competition. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington. No trial date has been set.
 Google called the government’s case “deeply flawed” and said it could raise phone prices.
 More state-led cases are in the pipeline. States including Colorado, Iowa, and Nebraska are also probing Google’s search practices, while Texas is investigating the company’s position in digital advertising.
 The private lawsuits may be brought both by rival companies and consumers claiming they’ve been harmed by the same conduct alleged in the federal or state cases. The suits often piggy-back on those cases, incorporating facts and allegations that officials have unearthed or won court judgments on.
 For instance, AOL Time Warner sued Microsoft Corp. in 2002 after a federal court had found that the software giant had illegally crushed the Netscape web browser, which AOL had acquired in 1999 during the 78-day trial of the government’s landmark antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.
 Microsoft paid $750 million to settle the AOL suit the following year. At one point, Microsoft faced more than 150 class-action lawsuits by consumers over its conduct, in addition to lawsuits by other competitors.
 Spencer Weber Waller, a professor at Loyola University Chicago’s law school, said he expects Google to face a similar scenario to Microsoft. Waller, who consulted on a Canadian case against Microsoft, said Google could also be exposed to private claims from abroad.
 Rivals may be more likely than consumers to follow the Justice Department’s case, while both consumers and competitors might want to follow state cases that are still in the works, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie.
 The Texas case, which is expected to be filed in the coming weeks, may emphasize how Google’s dominance can lead to higher prices, which could attract consumer claims, said Rie.
 “Wherever there’s a dollar sign, that’s where we’re going to see the private plaintiffs,” Rie said.
 Google faces an unrelated antitrust lawsuit from Epic Games Inc. over the 30% commission it charges developers on the Android Play store. The Epic suit has already launched follow-on complaints, including a consumer class action that was filed on Tuesday.
 Some lawmakers are trying to make it easier for such lawsuits to be filed. Earlier in October, a Democratic-led House subcommittee that’s been investigating competition in big tech recommended that Congress consider strengthening “private enforcement” by eliminating barriers to private lawsuits.
 Waller said that antitrust plaintiffs attorneys have likely been studying how to bring lawsuits against Google that could last years.
 “I think they’re thrilled that the government has brought this case,” he said.

Escape artist and magician James Randi, who spent decades investigating and debunking faith healers, mind readers, psychics and other fraudsters and charlatans who claimed paranormal powers has died, his foundation said. He was 92.
 "We are very sad to say that James Randi passed away yesterday, due to age- related causes. He had an Amazing life. We will miss him," the James Randi Educational Foundation said in a brief statement.
 Born Randall Zwinge in Toronto, Canada, in 1928, Randi was a child prodigy with an IQ of 168 and interested in magic from a young age, The Washington Post said.
 From the 1940s he worked as a stage magician and escape artist, eventually calling himself "The Amazing Randi".
 As an escapologist he had held two Guinness World Records -- for beating Harry Houdini's time for being sealed in an underwater coffin, one hour and 44 minutes, and for being encased in a block of ice for 55 minutes.
 While he enjoyed amazing audiences with his feats of escapology and sleight of hand, Randi had no time for so-called psychics and faith healers, exposing numerous fraudsters with his inside knowledge of a magician's tricks.
 As public fascination with the paranormal grew in the 1970s, Randi, along with sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov and astronomer Carl Sagan, co-founded what is now known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to investigate claims of paranormal phenomena and promote scientific inquiry.
 One of his most famous targets was Israeli self-professed psychic Uri Geller, who claimed to be able to bend spoons with the power of his mind.
 In 1973 Johnny Carson invited Geller on "The Tonight Show" and asked him to demonstrate his powers on a range of props but the flustered Geller was unable to, claiming he "didn't feel strong."
 Ahead of the show, the skeptical Carson, who had been a magician himself, had asked Randi for advice to expose any trickery.
 "I told them to provide their own props and not to let Geller or his people anywhere near them," Randi said.
 \- 'I'm a charlatan' -
 On a radio show in 1964 Randi had offered $1,000 to anyone who could show scientific evidence of paranormal powers.
 The sum grew over the years and through his James Randi Educational Foundation, the debunker offered $1 million to anyone who could demonstrate evidence of paranormal abilities under scientific scrutiny.
 "The difference between them and me," Randi told The New York Times in July 1981, "is that I admit that I'm a charlatan. They don't. I don't have time for things that go bump in the night."
 In 1980s Randi also famously exposed so-called faith healer Peter Popoff, showing that the televangelist was secretly using a radio earpiece to receive specific information about members of the congregation and their illnesses which he then claimed was revealed to him by God.
 Fellow magicians and skeptics paid tribute to Randi.
 "My inspiration, my hero, my mentor, my friend. I will talk to him the rest of my life and my memory of him will answer," illusionist Penn Jillette, of Penn and Teller, said on Twitter, with a picture of himself with the bushy-bearded Randi.
 "At some personal risk he bravely unveiled psychic and clairvoyant con-artists who claim mystical powers in order to scam the public. He did it with style, grace & humor," theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss said on Twitter.
 "We've lost one of the greats. He left the world better than he found it," said Bill Nye, "The Science Guy."
 Randi wrote several books debunking paranormal phenomena and other hoaxes. A documentary on his life exposing fake psychics and con artists was released in 2014, titled "An Honest Liar."

Ecco qui, la trasformazione e compiuta. E Di Maio e li, a rivendicare un posto per l'ex partito del Vaffa, nei salotti buoni del riformismo italiano ed europeo.

The disappointment of the Atlanta Braves getting a few runs away from their first World Series in 21 years will linger. They obviously haven't gotten that close in a long time, and while we doubt it will take that long again, it's still painful to know the Braves are finished for 2020.
   
 How can you complain, though, considering what this team went through? If we had said, as we watched the starting rotation crumble one pitcher at a time throughout the summer, that they would play the best team in baseball to a seven-game NLCS, we would have taken that every day of the week.
   
 There is a feeling of inevitability for this Braves team that they are going to win it all. The last time many of us had this feeling was in the early-1990s when the Braves lost two straight World Series and then a NLCS in 1993. It stung, but you knew their time was coming. It did in 1995.
   
 And after watching more young talent show potential the last few months, you know it's true again. The Braves have an excellent chance at getting deep into the playoffs once again and winning the next time around.
   
 Fans can't stop drooling over the starting rotation for next year. Injured starter Mike Soroka was so pumped up about 2021 that he met the team in the clubhouse Monday when they arrived back from Texas. The team will have to control him, but Soroka will be ready on or near Opening Day.
   
 It's easy to wonder what the Braves could have done with Soroka in the playoffs - having just one more good starting pitcher. But add Soroka to Max Fried, Ian Anderson and perhaps Kyle Wright or Bryse Wilson next year and you've got the makings of a great rotation.
   
 You can certainly count on general manager Alex Anthopoulos bringing in a veteran starter to the mix. The money will be available, and while top free agent Trevor Bauer may be a pipe dream, it's worth dreaming about.
   
 Add a solid veteran (one that's not hurt like Cole Hamels was) to this group of young pitchers and look out. The Braves could go from having a rotation in shambles to one of the best in baseball.
   
 Everybody wants the Braves to bring back Marcell Ozuna, and again, the money should be there to make that happen. We're not sure what the ownership will allow Anthopoulos to spend, but how could they pull back after the team got so close? That wouldn't make sense.
   
 It's difficult to project to what extent fans will be allowed in the stands next season, so you hope Liberty Media doesn't use that as an excuse. But over half of this year's payroll could come off the books, which could allow Anthopoulos to pursue a big-time starting pitcher (Bauer?) and bring Ozuna back.
   
 You can go ahead and pencil Cristian Pache in the lineup at center field. He showed enough to give the Braves confidence he will be good to go in 2020. These other young kids, like Austin Riley, will have another year under their belt. And you can expect some extra baserunning drills in spring training for Riley and Dansby Swanson after what happened in game seven.
   
 But even that is hard to gripe about. Yes, it was a horrible play that possibly cost the Braves a chance at going to the World Series. If those two runners had scored instead of running into an out, the score would have been 5-2 Atlanta. Yet you've just got to remember the Braves had no business there in the first place.
   
 Think about it. Soroka got hurt. Hamels stayed hurt. Both Mike Foltynewicz and Sean Newcomb were so bad they stayed at the alternate camp. Felix Hernandez opted out. Touki Toussaint was inconsistent. The rotation literally fell apart with the exception of Fried.
   
 Anderson saved them with a tremendous rookie showing and an historic postseason run. Plus, the emergence of Wright and Wilson must give the Braves hope they are ready to turn the corner and show consistency in the starting rotation.
   
 How can a team survive that debacle and make it to within a few runs of the World Series? It was crazy, just like this year has been. But after you get over the pain of watching the Dodgers play this week in the World Series, just remember how bright the future is for this Braves team.
   
 They'll be back in the NLCS, and next time the results could be very different.

The United Nations Secretary-General on Wednesday called upon the armed separatist group "the Polisario" and its militia once again to leave the buffer zone of Guerguerat and not obstruct regular civil and commercial traffic in this area.      "We recall that regular civil and commercial traffic must not be hampered (in Guerguerat) and that no measure must be taken which could represent a change of the status quo in the buffer zone" of Guerguerat, said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, at his daily press briefing in New York.      The spokesperson deplored that the members of MINURSO noted this Wednesday that a group made up of "fifty individuals", belonging to the Polisario and its militia, were in Guerguerat and they "obstructed traffic in the region".      "We urge all the concerned parties to show restraint and take all necessary measures to ease tensions," Dujarric said.      He also said that MINURSO has mobilized "more of its elements this morning in the area to help ease any tension and unblock civil and commercial" traffic, adding that MINURSO will continue to closely monitor the situation.      The UN Chief had repeatedly ordered the Polisario and its militia to stop obstructing civil and commercial traffic in Guerguerat, including last September through his deputy spokesperson in New York.

Lisa Garrison, Class of 1991 and a two-year member of Aggie Hostesses, said the group of about 60 women supported the athletic program and played a role in hosting football recruits on game days. Garrison said without the internet and exposure to the culture of different universities, their ability to answer recruits’ and their families' questions was a big part of connecting with prospective students.
 “We would go sit with the family during the game and do on-the-field things like pre-game press stuff,” Garrison said. “I just think it’s invaluable that when athletes are brought onto campus, you see someone they can ask questions to, someone close to their age and in the student realm.”
 In addition to learning what it took to run a football program of such high caliber, Garrison said her favorite part of her involvement with Aggie Hostesses was getting to know some of the football athletes and seeing them be successful on the field.
 “You know, you have that personal relationship, you just want the best things to happen to those athletes,” Garrison said. “I think that’s what I valued most, serving in an organization and watching people be successful.”
 In 2016, the organization rebranded itself and became the Aggie Elites in order to “better represent our members as strong, empowering, influential and successful women,” according to the team’s website.
 Chloe Shelby, Class of 2020, joined the newly renovated organization her freshman year, which allowed her to serve former A&M athletes in the Jackie Sherrill Lettermen's Lounge on game days, as well as help with the spring football game and various athletic reunions. However, Aggie Elites didn’t last long as the football coaching staff change in 2017 resulted in another rebranding of the organization.
 “With the coaching staff change that year, everything was up in the air with the entire athletic department,” Shelby said. “That’s essentially why we transitioned. Coach Fisher had a similar support group at Florida State and wanted to have that at A&M.”
 Shelby was one of the few members of Aggie Elites that continued in the organization and helped establish Team 12 in January of 2018. When comparing the two groups, Shelby said Team 12 is much more professional and well- respected under the new athletic department leadership.

Government has taken away my life
 Dear Government,
 I am 24 years old and a member of the Z generation. Today I lose my job, perhaps permanently. I live with my parents. Presently I am not allowed embark on a relationship, go to a pub, restaurant or gig, meet my friends or go on holidays. In short, I have no life. Sometimes I wonder is there any point in getting up in the morning.
 And all for what? To protect an inadequate healthcare system for which you and your previous administrations are directly responsible.
 And, of course, it is my generation that will have to foot the bill for these borrowed billions.
 Thank you for taking away my life.

Of course this isn’t a level playing field
 You’d do well to have friends in high places as we enter Level Five of the Covid-19 restrictions.
 While I accept the need for tough measures to tackle the virus and save lives, it does jar a bit when I think of the activities that are permitted to continue, as if they had some intrinsic or incalculable value that set them apart.
 Dr Tony Holohan says that people need something to look forward to at this time, and that’s fine, but isn’t the man or woman struggling to keep the local shoe shop or delicatessen open as deserving of a sporting chance as any hurler or footballer? It will be a crime for the next six weeks to have a cup of coffee downtown with a friend or acquaintance, but perfectly in order for horse and greyhound racing to proceed. A surprise exemption to the no-sport rule has been live hare coursing; a “sport” that is a criminal offence in the rest of Europe, apart from Spain.
 At any time this organised animal cruelty is abhorrent, but for the government to facilitate it right now is mind-boggling.
 I ask: Does a visit to the gym pose a greater risk to public health than organising a hare coursing match?
 Is a meticulously sanitised hair dressing or beauty salon to be deemed less hygienic than a muck entrusted or rain-sodden animal-baiting venue?
 Our leaders have now decreed that in the middle of this pandemic it’s acceptable to arrange for horses or dogs to run in circles for gambling purposes and for humans to set dogs on hares for the craic... while the rest of us are expected to abide by rules that will turn our lives upside-down, possibly affect our mental health, and decimate the national economy.

It consolidated a watchful approach with regard to limitations to fundamental rights and motivated an expansive interpretation of academic freedom as a fundamental right guarantee. As such, the requirement of institutional autonomy is a welcome clarification to Article 13 of the Charter. It will be interesting to see whether this standard may raise questions of compatibility with respect to other higher education institutions in the EU. For the time being, however, the judgment signals the Court’s commitment to protect academic freedom in the EU – and that is, after all the misery that the CEU was put through, a positive development.

The problem is the lack of humanity in how models and algorithms are developed, considered, and used. Too often they are developed behind closed doors and become impervious to dissenting voices. Surely someone must have thought recalibrating grades was a bad idea, particularly given the bias against individual schools and stress on young people already caused by the crisis? And surely someone from one of the three central testing labs must have wondered why positive test cases had stopped increasing nationally in early October, despite what they were seeing locally? And surely many people think, as we do, that the figure of 7% behind the reluctance to introduce airport testing is unrealistically low?

Team 12’s primary advisor and assistant director of Letterman’s Association, Lindsey Quisenberry, Class of 2008, said making the group co-ed was one of the main purposes and most significant changes of the transition from Aggie Elites to Team 12.
 “Team 12 is more of an event-based organization that we wanted to be able to help with multiple events throughout the event department,” Quisenberry said. “We wanted there to be more jobs available instead of just that generic, cute girl greeting a football player.”
 Quisenberry said Team 12 is the first friendly face guests see, whether they’re a former athlete returning to campus for an event or visiting for the first time as a prospective student-athlete. The team’s members are assigned tasks such as door holding, registration check-in, and directing the flow of traffic.
 “As a staff member, I’m able to rely on the group, which makes my game day job easier because I know the duties and tasks we’ve assigned them are getting done,” Quisenberry said. “I don't have to micromanage.”
 When asked what her favorite memory is from her involvement in the organization, Shelby said that although she enjoyed game days a lot, she loved the behind-the-scenes moments even more.
 “I really just loved the small, quiet moments like working football camp and getting to know the staff on a personal level,” Shelby said. “On social media you see these people with the verified check mark and in all the limelight, but we got to see them for being humans and get an inside look at the struggles that went on in practices and all.”
 Additionally, as the daughter of former A&M football player Jimmie Shelby, Chloe said it would make her day to see who was on the list of former athletes coming to the Letterman’s Lounge each game. She said getting to meet people and hear their stories influenced her decision to pursue a career in student- athlete development.
 Team 12’s current president, junior Peyton Liebler has a similar passion for the organization and for making people’s experience in Aggieland the best it can be.
 “I always explain to people that one cool thing about Team 12 is we see both sides of the field, but also two sides of a player,” Liebler said. “They start out as a recruit, to a letterman, and it’s an amazing process to see how people who bring so much to this university can start as well as continue their journey.”
 Liebler said getting to make the Aggie Spirit happen is a remarkable experience.
 “I can tell you I have literally never felt more value, praise and fulfillment in something that is solely about experience for other people,” Liebler said. “It’s so cool just to understand that we have the ability to make the Aggie experience for people on both sides of the field — whether you’re a recruit or someone that’s long graduated from A&M that are lettermen.”

 The disappointment of the Atlanta Braves getting a few runs away from their first World Series in 21 years will linger. They obviously haven't gotten that close in a long time, and while we doubt it will take that long again, it's still painful to know the Braves are finished for 2020.
 How can you complain, though, considering what this team went through? If we had said, as we watched the starting rotation crumble one pitcher at a time throughout the summer, that they would play the best team in baseball to a seven-game NLCS, we would have taken that every day of the week.
 There is a feeling of inevitability for this Braves team that they are going to win it all. The last time many of us had this feeling was in the early-1990s when the Braves lost two straight World Series and then a NLCS in 1993. It stung, but you knew their time was coming. It did in 1995.
 And after watching more young talent show potential the last few months, you know it's true again. The Braves have an excellent chance at getting deep into the playoffs once again and winning the next time around.
 Fans can't stop drooling over the starting rotation for next year. Injured starter Mike Soroka was so pumped up about 2021 that he met the team in the clubhouse Monday when they arrived back from Texas. The team will have to control him, but Soroka will be ready on or near Opening Day.
 It's easy to wonder what the Braves could have done with Soroka in the playoffs - having just one more good starting pitcher. But add Soroka to Max Fried, Ian Anderson and perhaps Kyle Wright or Bryse Wilson next year and you've got the makings of a great rotation.
 You can certainly count on general manager Alex Anthopoulos bringing in a veteran starter to the mix. The money will be available, and while top free agent Trevor Bauer may be a pipe dream, it's worth dreaming about.
 Add a solid veteran (one that's not hurt like Cole Hamels was) to this group of young pitchers and look out. The Braves could go from having a rotation in shambles to one of the best in baseball.
 Everybody wants the Braves to bring back Marcell Ozuna, and again, the money should be there to make that happen. We're not sure what the ownership will allow Anthopoulos to spend, but how could they pull back after the team got so close? That wouldn't make sense.
 It's difficult to project to what extent fans will be allowed in the stands next season, so you hope Liberty Media doesn't use that as an excuse. But over half of this year's payroll could come off the books, which could allow Anthopoulos to pursue a big-time starting pitcher (Bauer?) and bring Ozuna back.
 You can go ahead and pencil Cristian Pache in the lineup at center field. He showed enough to give the Braves confidence he will be good to go in 2020. These other young kids, like Austin Riley, will have another year under their belt. And you can expect some extra baserunning drills in spring training for Riley and Dansby Swanson after what happened in game seven.
 But even that is hard to gripe about. Yes, it was a horrible play that possibly cost the Braves a chance at going to the World Series. If those two runners had scored instead of running into an out, the score would have been 5-2 Atlanta. Yet you've just got to remember the Braves had no business there in the first place.
 Think about it. Soroka got hurt. Hamels stayed hurt. Both Mike Foltynewicz and Sean Newcomb were so bad they stayed at the alternate camp. Felix Hernandez opted out. Touki Toussaint was inconsistent. The rotation literally fell apart with the exception of Fried.
 Anderson saved them with a tremendous rookie showing and an historic postseason run. Plus, the emergence of Wright and Wilson must give the Braves hope they are ready to turn the corner and show consistency in the starting rotation.
 How can a team survive that debacle and make it to within a few runs of the World Series? It was crazy, just like this year has been. But after you get over the pain of watching the Dodgers play this week in the World Series, just remember how bright the future is for this Braves team.
 They'll be back in the NLCS, and next time the results could be very different.

The Annawan Police Department has a new home at 110 South Depot St., the former location of Unity Point Clinic - Family Medicine.
   
 When Unity Point outgrew its space and moved into a larger office in Annawan, their original location was donated to the Village of Annawan. The new clinic is Hammond-Henry Urgent Care.
   
 Mayor Tim Wise and the Village Board decided that space would become the Annawan Police Station and the six part-time officers and one full-time officer (Chief Elliott) moved into their new home near the end of September. Annawan Police Chief Doug Elliott is very happy with the larger space and said, "We love the size of our new station."
   
 The police department previously was housed in what Elliott refers to as "a closet. We had one room, probably about 15 ft. by 5 ft. in a back closet of the Village Hall and there were no windows."
   
 The Village Hall is located in a building at 200 North Meadow Lane in Annawan.
   
 "All the credit goes to Mayor Tim Wise and the village board," Elliott said. "About three years ago when Mayor Wise became mayor, he came into the station and said, 'We are going to get you a new police station'. He looked around our (former space) and he had been police chief in Annawan so he knew how inconvenient the small space was. But I thought that is just one of those things and maybe one of these days, right….And it is now a reality. I have been a policeman for 33 years and really didn't think this would happen this soon."
   
 Elliott served on the Rock Island Police Department for 25 years before joining the Annawan Dept. as Police Chief seven years ago.
   
 There are seven rooms and two bathrooms in the new location of the Police Dept. and moving into the new space didn't come without work, and Elliott explained, "We completely gutted the whole thing. It had a flat roof and we put a slanted roof on, replaced all the wiring, put in new water pipes and new duct work, central air, new furnace, new water heater, new generator and installed new carpeting. And we have absolutely no debt."
   
 "The building was donated to us and all of the renovating and remodeling was done with TIF money and through grants received with the help of State Senator Dan Swanson," Elliott said. "I love showing off this building."
   
 Wise also is proud of the project and said, "It was a combined effort by village employees, private donations and special use funds that allowed us to do this project debt free."
   
 "We are happy with this space as there is now proper evidence storage space and work space for Doug and the part-time officers that work for us," Wise said. "It also provides privacy for meeting with victims and witnesses."

The second limb of reform concerned the requirement that only those universities may be authorised to operate in Hungary that provide education in their State of origin. It is noteworthy that this provision draws no distinction as to whether the institutions have their seat in a Member State of the EU or outside the Union. Against this background, the Court first focused on those institutions that have their seat outside the EU, thus assessing the compatibility of the reform with Article XVII of the GATS. The Court’s reasoning on this point mirrors the arguments developed with a view to the first limb of reform. The national measure constituted a deterioration of the situation of foreign education providers; Hungary claimed it was necessary for public order reasons but failed to provide evidence to that end and the Court – once again – did not buy it. As a corollary, the Court found the second limb of Hungary’s reform to equally violate the GATS, and thus, an integral part of Union law (paras. 152-156).

Next, as to the substance, the Court first recalled the concept of freedom of association defined by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). According to this concept, freedom of association constitutes one of the essential bases of a democratic and pluralist society. Inasmuch as it allows citizens to act collectively in fields of mutual interest and, in doing so, to contribute to the proper functioning of public life (see ECtHR cases _Gorzelik and Others v. Poland_ and _Tebieti Mühafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov v. Azerbaijan_). In light of this case law, the Court of Justice of the European Union found that the Hungary’s Law, by its systematic obligations, creates a deterrent effect for donors’ residing in other MSs and, thus, hinders the proper functioning of public life. Therefore, the Law infringes upon the freedom of association enshrined in Article 12 (1) Charter.

A second problem with the EU’s response to democratic backsliding is that so far it has focused on deploying punitive measures – either via the Article 7 mechanism, infringement procedures or financial pressure. For instance, in May 2018, the Commission put forward a proposal to enable it to reduce or suspend EU funding if a Member State did not respect the rule of law. But there are concerns among independent experts that the draft regulation fails to make a solid connection between the objective of protecting the EU’s financial interests and deficiencies in the rule of law in a Member State. While the EU has various sticks to punish those that flout the rule of law, it has yet to develop any carrots to help encourage public support, and to increase understanding of why it cannot turn a blind eye on the rule of law violations. The Report could be a step in the right direction since, it explicitly covers both negative and positive rule of law developments, highlighting both challenging and reassuring reforms in the member states and indeed, emphasizing positive developments, so as to encourage member states. As pointed out by Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice and Consumers, it provides a way to both share good practices and pre-empt challenges before they become entrenched.
