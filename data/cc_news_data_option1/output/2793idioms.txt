FRANKFURT - The European Central Bank has left its monetary stimulus programs unchanged ahead of a key meeting of EU leaders on a recovery plan meant to help the economy bounce back from the coronavirus shutdowns.


  The ECB held off providing new measures Thursday after unleashing massive doses of monetary stimulus in recent weeks that have helped keep borrowing costs for companies and consumers at roughly pre-virus levels.


  At its last meeting June 4, the bank’s 25-member governing council increased its pandemic emergency bond purchase program by 600 billion euros to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.7 trillion), a step which pumps newly created money into the economy with the aim of keeping credit cheap and abundant for those who need it.


  One big goal for central banks such as the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve is to prevent the public health crisis from creating panic on financial markets that would constrict financing for companies at a time when many are struggling to stay in business due to restrictions on activity or reluctance by consumers to risk infection through face to face interaction.


  The next big policy news in Europe will come on Friday, when leaders of the 27 EU countries discuss a proposed recovery fund backed by common borrowing. The ECB has urged governments to help support the economy through their spending policies.

“It’s just about putting in the time and tinkering with your setup until you find what works,” Spencer said. “Once you get a few fish under your belt, you start to figure out how they like the lures jigged.”


  On a good day, Spencer will catch four or five fish, though he’s landed as many as 15. To date, his personal best is a 44-inch monster that weighed 38 pounds. That was before Idaho Fish & Game instituted the catch-and-release record program—the current record is a 41.5-inch whopper landed by Dylan Smith in 2018 (also at Payette Lake, but during summer).

A longtime costume shop will no longer display its black limo hearse or spooky inflatables out front in the fall along St. Andrews Boulevard in West Ashley.


  Hokus Pokus has moved, leaving empty the former aisles filled with bagged costumes, multicolored wigs, pirate coats, ruffly tutus and so much more along a busy stretch of suburban Charleston.


  It can now be found at Citadel Mall, taking over the former space of lingerie purveyor Victoria's Secret. The costume store is still being set up, but look for an opening around Aug. 1, generally the three-month launch ahead of the busy Halloween season.

"I started [sports as a young girl] with dance, and I got really good in tumbling," Hutson said. "I was on a tumble team, and that led to gymnastics . . . which gave me all my body awareness [that came in handy in diving and vaulting].
 "I didn't really have goals," Hutson added, "I just wanted to win at anything. When I won those McMillan Awards I was clueless — I had no idea of the prestige involved."
 And when she got to Indiana State, Hutson took off — literally.
 "It all started with her being an all-around good athlete," said Jeff Martin, ISU's current associate head coach who is in charge of jumps. "She had a great high school coach in Mike Dason, who used her in multiple events [including, Hutson no doubt recalls, quite a few more 400s] and built a very good foundation. And Travis Herb did a good job teaching her [in vaulting].
 "She was able put all her focus in just pole vault, and when she was on the pole she knew no fear," Martin continued. "I just tried to stay out of her way."
 "It was just my drive," Hutson said in explaining her improvement as a Sycamore. "Jeff Martin was my pole vault coach, and we created goals together. Then it was just a matter of getting better year by year. I wanted to be the best, I just didn't realize I could be the best."
 "I just wanted her to be the best and win one [national championship]," Martin said. "Four? I was lucky enough to ride the wave with her."
 Hutson continued to compete after college, but fell short of her ultimate goal — a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. "I had a back injury that made me give up that dream," she said.
 She currently works as a marketing and acquisitions analyst for a real estate firm in the Phoenix area (her competitive drive hasn't abated, she said). She doesn't know if her athletic history is a help, but added, "When people Google me, at least it's not something bad."
 She was married in October to Jake Conn, who was also a pole vaulter at ISU. "I never beat his best jump," she said in mock regret. "He's cleared 16-feet- plus, and my best was 15-7."
 • Other notables — North has had seven female McMillan Award winners, won by five girls. Three-sport star Amy Hogan was the first, followed by distance runner Angie Draper, then Hutson twice, then tennis star Brittany Farmer and finally distance runner Chanli Mundy, also twice.
 The Patriots have also had an Indiana Miss Softball in Megan Ciolli and individual state champions in gymnast Hickory Roesch, high jumper Karen Byrd and cross country runner TaPring Goatee.
 Other Patriots standouts, alphabetically, include Nicole Anderson, Kayla Alexander, Amy Borgnini, Burdick, Dorsett, Elsey, Grimes, Rachel Gutish, Amy Hamilton, Jennifer Macke, Missy Mankin, Chloe Mason, Kelly Meggs, Tonya Nation, Amanda Royer, Jenny Somerville, Weatherford, Lindsey Wells and Molly Williams.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

But in the Miata, none of that matters. What matters is that in the year 2020, you can get virtually the same wonderful car that came onto the market in 1989 -- simply adapted for modern comfort and design.
 Stepping into a Miata isn't like stepping into a time capsule; it's like stepping into a time that never truly changed, and stepping out of a world that can't help changing by the second, even in a pandemic. The 2020 Miata is the same car my mom brought home in 2002, and it's the same car she traded it for, twice, in the decades following. It's the same car I spent countless days dizzying myself in as a child in the passenger seat, and it's the same car as the 2004 Mazdaspeed that lives in my garage.

But sometimes, defanging profanity just doesn't quite hit the mark. In her research on swearing, Emma Byrne, author of "Swearing is Good for You," finds that "the frisson of taboo" is required for the therapeutic qualities of swearing like pain relief. As Byrne reports, learning swear words early on in one's native language has a measurable physiological effects. Cursing helps relieve pain, raise the pulse, and sharpen the memory.

Egyptians should comprehend that despite their historically adopted aggressive approach to the flow of the River Nile and their utmost desire of sticking to the undeserved privileges and the so-called "acquired rights" of the colonial brokered treaties of the 1929 and 1959, however, upper streamed countries no longer forced to place themselves under the mercy hand of Cairo to implement their development plan on the Nile and its tributaries. No power can force them to subject their national development plans to the inspection and supervision of Egypt again. The historical right of Egypt on the Nile has gone with the wind of colonialism. And there is no such thing called historical right in the international water laws.
