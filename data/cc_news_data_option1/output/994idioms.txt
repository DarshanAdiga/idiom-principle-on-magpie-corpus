The neighboring country Germany is going another way. Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn described the demand for a comprehensive closure of schools and kindergartens as "lighthearted". It is right to temporarily and occasionally close facilities in suspected cases, said the CDU politician. "I am very reserved across the board." If children had to stay at home and need care, this affects nursing staff, doctors, police officers or bus drivers who are important for the maintenance of public life. Spahn also doubted that the most vulnerable group, namely the elderly, would be better protected by comprehensive school closings. In the past few days, it had emerged that children rarely contract the virus, but they can spread it further. He was not sure that all the consequences would be considered, Spahn said.

Many employees are occupied with appeasing the predilections of superiors, or meeting narrow KPI assessments, and as a result, fall short of prioritising customers. Should an uncertainty or risk arise, those same employees will habitually shirk responsibility to layers of superiority, or simply turn a blind eye. These are the features of bureaucracy, or the 'Big Company Disease', an insidious parasite that slowly eats away the vitality of an organisation.

TUPELO, Miss. (AP) — A contentious school conference between a student, her parents and a school principal has finally come to a head, 10 years after the meeting. Former Lee County Middle School principal Steven Havens, 52, was charged with attempted aggravated assault, after he called a man on Wednesday to say he was coming over to “whip the man's posterior,\" the Daily Journal reported. The victim told the paper that he hadn't spoken to Havens in at least 10 years. When Havens arrived to the victim's home, the man said he told Havens to leave but instead Havens threw a punch and the two men started fighting. The victim pressed charges against Havens Thursday. Havens, who surrendered to authorities Friday, was the Guntown Middle School principal from 2007 until 2016 and retired from the school district in December 2019. The two men had exchanged words in February 2010 after a conference about the victim's stepdaughter, according to a lawsuit filed by the victim in July 2011. The suit said Havens called the victim's stepdaughter to his office to ask whether she posted a message on Facebook encouraging her classmates to violate the school's dress code to make him mad. When the student admitted she had, Havens told her she would be held responsible for the other students if they listened to her, the lawsuit said. A conference with Havens, the student, her mom and step-dad ended when the man called Havens a coward, the suit said. Havens called the police, demanding the victim be arrested for disturbing the peace, the lawsuit said. Charges brought against the man were dismissed in March 2011, court documents said. The man filed a lawsuit and it was dismissed with prejudice in February 2013. The man and school district settled. Havens was released on a $25,000 property...

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- After a disappointing end to the regular season with losses to teams who played in the SEC Tournament's Wednesday of Woe, otherwise known as the opening round, there have been numerous post-mortems written about the University of Alabama basketball team, with a surprise ending.
   
 There's still at least one game to play.
   
 The game will go on, but it won't be played in front of fans. The league announced after Wednesday's opener between Georgia and Ole Miss that fans will not be in attendance for the remainder of the tournament.
   
 Fans did attend the opener and the later session between Vanderbilt and Arkansas.
   
 Earlier Wednesday the NCAA President Mark Emmert announced the NCAA men's and women's tournament will also be played in front of no fans. Only "essential staff and family family attendance" will be able to view the games.
   
 The decision also affects all campus sports activities, according SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey.
   
 "In light of recent developments beyond our control related to the spread of the coronavirus, including a recommendation from the NCAA COVID-19 Advisory Panel, and after consultation with our member universities, we have made the difficult decision to hold the 2020 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament in Nashville without spectators beginning with games of Thursday, March 12," Sankey said Wednesday. "Effective immediately, the policy will also apply to other SEC Championship events and on-campus regular season games scheduled through at least the end of March."
   
 The Crimson Tide opens its Nashville run in a familiar spot, as the No. 9 seed against No. 8 seed Tennessee. A win would lead to a matchup with top-seeded Kentucky but Alabama coach Nate Oats isn't looking that far ahead.
   
 "Let's get back to playing good basketball," Oats said at his Tuesday media opportunity in Tuscaloosa. "You'd like to be playing your best basketball when the SEC Tournament comes around and last week (in losses to Vanderbilt and Missouri), we just weren't, for numerous reasons."
   
 One of those reasons was injury. Junior forward John Petty Jr. missed the Vanderbilt game with an elbow injury and returned but was ineffective against Missouri. Without his perimeter shooting, along with Herb Jones' injured wrist, the Crimson Tide was unable to spread the floor with shooters and the result at Missouri was the worst offensive output of the year.
   
 "Petty being back is great," Oats said, indicating that he expected more production from the junior forward. "He looked much better in practice today, he was hitting threes in practice so hopefully he looks much better on Thursday than he did (last) Saturday."
   
 Jones was absent in Alabama's regular-season loss to Tennessee, a game which the Crimson Tide led by as many as 15 points in the first half but lost 69-68 after the Volunteer' inside game dominated the second half.
   
 "(Yves) Pons is the (SEC) Defensive Player of the Year and I think he's the best athlete in the league," Oats said. "But he had eight offensive rebounds against us, went for 14 (points) and 14 (rebounds.) John Fulkerson had 22 points. They rebounded 56 percent of their missed shots in the second half. They destroyed us on the boards. We can't have that.
   
 "Herb being back should help (with the rebounding) but we need a better effort from everyone. We need more from (Alex) Reese. He's as frustrated as anyone with the way he's been playing and he's looked a lot better in practice."
   
 Alabama has won its first game in SEC Tournament play for four consecutive years going into Thursday's noon contest.

"Never pleased to finish second, but overall I was struggling pretty much all day, just with bike setup and not really feeling comfortable with the track," said Sexton. "It was more outdoorsy than I really expected. On a supercross setup, we just didn't really feel comfortable. Just kind of struggled. In the heat race, I had a crash, ran over a rider, and then got back to third. I really felt like I rode pretty well. For the main event that put me in not a very good spot on the gate. I was pretty far outside. I just tried to give the best effort I could and got into the corner first, but I went too far wide. Made a few quick passes. Garrett was out front. I knew he was going to be tough to beat. He was riding good all day. I put my head down and tried to close the gap a little bit, but overall he was riding really well. I can't take anything away from him. I just didn't have it tonight. Going back into Indianapolis, my home race, with an extended points lead, feels good."

The US dollar is in free fall, as are commodity currencies while the CHF and yen catch a bid across the board following the US President's address to the nation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic being termed so by the World Health Organisation. At the time of writing, DXY is trading at 96.16 having travelled between a high of 96.66 and a low of 96.14. The World Health Organization has declared the worldwide outbreak of the new coronavirus a pandemic, with more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and 4,291 deaths. "We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday. In response, US markets plummeted with the DJIA closing in bearish territory for the first time in a decade.The Dow DJIA fell following apowerful decline of 18% in shares of component Boeing Co.
