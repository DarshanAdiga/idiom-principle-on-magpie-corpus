For someone with a commanding voice who was able to lead groups of 100 or more, a diagnosis of a rare neurological voice disorder was devastating news.
 Susan Beck, of Louisville, was diagnosed back in 2016 with spasmodic dysphonia after noticing strange symptoms earlier in the year. She was 56 at the time. She had spent a large portion of her early career as a software instructor and had developed her “teaching voice” during this time, she explained.
 But by the time spring 2016 rolled around, she was having trouble projecting her voice and being heard. It was like her voice would break, like she was nervous.
 “I knew I wasn’t nervous,” she said. “I had done this hundreds of times before, so I actually found it to be quite embarrassing that I couldn’t make my voice work.”
 Beck struggled for the next few months and even tried self-diagnosing; she tried every type of allergy medication available. Nothing worked. Her next step was to see a doctor who was able to tell her what was wrong.
 She was told she had a vocal fold nodule and spasmodic dysphonia. The nodule healed with the help of steroids, but her spasmodic dysphonia grew worse. Beck was sent to a specialist at Vanderbilt Voice Center in Nashville for botox treatments.
 Spasmodic dysphonia is a neurological voice disorder that involves involuntary spasms of the muscles in the vocal cords, causing interruption of speech and affecting the voice quality. SD causes the voice to break up and sometimes will make the voice have a strained or strangled quality.
 The botox injections are working for Beck, who travels to Vanderbilt every 10-12 weeks for treatment. The injections are placed in her vocal cords and relax the muscles that are constricting them.
 There is no known cause or cure for SD. It is estimated that SD affects about 50,000 people in North America, but the number could be higher due to misdiagnosis or undiagnosed cases. The age of onset is usually 40 to 60 years old and there are more women than men with the disorder.
 Beck said her diagnosis was even more frightening than when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer 10 years earlier. “The cancer was caught early enough that surgery was the solution and I haven’t had any other problems since then,” she explained.
 It was after her diagnosis that Beck started looking for more information about her condition. She found the website for National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association, which was very helpful, Beck said. She became a board member for NSDA and also development director. She also started a support group in Knoxville after discovering there wasn’t one.
 “NSDA has made a huge difference in my ability to deal with my voice problem,” Beck said. “I want to do everything I can to make sure that we are improving the lives of people affected with spasmodic dysphonia and related voice conditions through research, education, awareness and support.”
 She looked for ways to be able to give back and found it with her father, the late Paul Long, and his artwork. Long lived in Friendsville for years and had his own art gallery. He was known for his oil and watercolors of rural landscapes, home portraits and historic buildings, including the Blount County Courthouse.
 The self-taught artist was born in 1927 in Tellico Plains but moved to Friendsville in 1990 and stayed until 2008. He was even vice mayor of Friendsville for a few years. He passed away in December 2015. The World War II veteran was a resident of the Ben Atchley State Veterans Home in Knoxville. His career as a physicist was spent at Y-12 Nuclear Weapons Facility in Oak Ridge.
 Many pieces of Long’s art are in collections throughout the U.S. and several foreign countries. Some are on display at the East Tennessee Historical Society in Knoxville and the Charles Hall Museum in Tellico Plains.
 To raise money for the NSDA, Beck is donating for sale fine art prints by her father. The watercolor and oil paintings are from the 1970s through the 2000s. They are priced from $50 to $100.
 “Daddy grew up loving to express himself through his artwork,” Beck said. “I have some of his sketches from his early years which he made into a 4-inch bound volume of an action hero comic book. He did a lot of his earlier paintings in oil and later one expressed himself in watercolors. He also loved woodworking and carved beautiful Santa Clauses and turned goblets and interesting bowls on his lathe.”
 Beck said her favorite painting by her father is one he did in 1964. It is of Beck and her older brother, David, in a haunted house with a cat. It hangs in Beck’s foyer.
 Long probably was most proud of the East Tennessee courthouses that he painted, his daughter said. He also was proud of his painting of the Battle of Campbell Station that hangs at Farragut Town Hall.
 That she can share her father’s talent while also raising funds and awareness for spasmodic dysphonia gives Beck a feeling of hopefulness. Getting a diagnosis like this is devastating. Having a support group and the NSDA on your side means everything, she said.
 “I know firsthand how important it is to find someone to talk to about this mysterious disorder,” Beck explained. “The NSDA was a lifesaver for me. ... There may be so many more people out there that have SD but they never found a doctor that could give them the correct diagnosis. I know it seems strange in 2020 that this could happen, but it still does.”

It's also hilarious because I'm the one who keeps pointing out there's an ethical quandary in choosing as #1 a prez who presided over internecine warfare as a solution to national problems, and instead if waging it on the defensible principle of "it's immoral to own slaves", he did it in the principle that "you just left a dysfunctional relationship four score and 7 [5] years ago, so now you're stuck with this one forever". But to his defense, there's probably no way he could have gotten a clear mandate to launch the war based on eliminating slavery, and certainly not black voting rights/full citizenship, when he couldn't even do it with border states, and northern states outside New England didn't give blacks much in the way of voting rights much less full equality.

I now discuss in a wider perspective the unifying influence of Islam. Through religion, opposed both to the disruptive force of clanship and of European colonialism, some precedent for national patriotism exists. Despite the high degree of cultural homogeneity of the Somali as a whole effective national unity is so slight that the appeal to unity is framed in terms of Muslim solidarity. The hostility between clans and clan-families is normally such that despite the community of culture and language the only permanent bridge along which unity may be established is religion. The call to pan-Somali nationalism is to a large extent founded on the Islamic ideal of the brotherhood of Muslims within the Somali community. As we have seen, all the national parties stress the brotherhood of Somali as Muslims, which is only to be expected, since the Somali are deeply attached to Islam which permeates all aspects of their life. We have noted that in the organization of the national parties and in that of the Somali Dervish Orders there are common features. Both possess uniforms or distinguishing features of dress, religious slogans, and a hierarchal administrative structure. As the national parties now advocate, the leaders of the religious orders have always preached the ideal of the equality of Somali irrespective of lineage affiliation. And the forces of agnation and custom which have opposed the realization of this ideal have weakened the strength of the Sufi _tariiqas_ just as much as they now also undermine the strength of national party solidarity. Lineage-groups among the Samaale nomads are still stronger than Dervish Order or political party. A man may belong to a political party and to a _tariiqa,_ but his primary allegiance is to his lineage of birth. Nor in the present economic conditions is this surprising. Nevertheless, the doctrine of Muslim unity propagated by the Sufi Orders has to some extent prepared the ground for the emergence of nationalism, and this is true even when the Somali religious orders have themselves habitually been at loggerheads and constituted a dividing force in the country. Already, particularly in Somalia, the religious rebellion _(jihaad)_ led against Christian Colonialism by Sayyid Mahammad `Abdille Hassan (the so-called ' Mad Mullah' of the Saalihiya Order) from 1899 to 1920, is beginning to be viewed as a turn of the century expression of Somali nationalism. Somali who recall the struggles of their forefathers in the medieval wars between the Sultanates of Awdal and Christian Abyssinia regard these also as nationalistic in scope. At the present time, none of the nationalistic parties has adopted the banner of _the jihaad_ in summoning popular support, but a strong religious element persists in all their activities and could assume this character, particularly in Christian Ethiopia. The degree to which Islam may play a significant part in reinforcing internal Somali nationalist aspirations seems to depend largely upon the role adopted by Ethiopia, and, to a lesser extent, on future French policy in the _Cote des Somalis_ and on British policy in Kenya.

Elements in the black community also seem to find wokeism congenial, because the idea that they are a colonized population makes it possible to argue that all the problems that they face in the larger American society are due to the structural racism inherent in it. That implies that they are owed something in addition to equality of opportunity, because of what was taken from their ancestors by slavery and continues to be taken from them by institutional racism. Unfortunately, the anti-Jewish aspects of woke culture fit in with the historical antisemitic bias of the black community, which was introduced by the Nation of Islam as early as the 1930s, and today is represented by Louis Farrakhan. The racial disturbances and controversies of the 1960s (like the New York teachers’ strike) sharpened the differences between blacks and Jews in urban areas.

Colorado's wins came against South Dakota and Kansas State without D'Shawn Schwartz, who tested positive for the virus before the game against the Coyotes. Contact tracing within the program led to the game against the Sun Devils to be postponed because the Buffaloes were under the minimum of available scholarship players.
 Originally, Colorado was slated to play Colorado State on Tuesday but the Rams shut down basketball activities Nov. 20 due to COVID-19 concerns. The Buffaloes then scheduled a game with Division II Colorado School of Mines but pivoted when the matchup against Tennessee was set.
 The game was in the works for a few days but if Washington State was able to play Sunday, Colorado would not have traveled to play the Volunteers.
 Schwartz should be available to play against the Volunteers, coach Tad Boyle said, though the team has yet to play at full strength.
 "We were not at full strength against South Dakota. We weren't at full strength against K-State. And we will not be at full strength against Tennessee," Boyle said. "But we're going to go hook it up and see what happens. In (Schwartz's) workout (Saturday), he was probably in better shape than we thought he would be and he shot the ball well.
 "One thing about D'Shawn, he's a senior, he's a veteran. You expect him to pick up where he left off, but we'll see how the next few days unfolds, where he's at."

Regulations have to protect consumers and hence supervision has to keep that as the philosophy. Unless we can improve regulatory supervision to be proactive and predictive in assessment, we cannot afford corporate groups ending up owning banks. In the same breath, even banks owning other financial services companies is a peril, as it puts core capital and group-lending exposure at risk. In this, we need regulators to have same set of guiding principles, sooner than they wish to. And in this journey, let them show compassion (for consumers) in regulation and passion (for fiscal stability) in supervision. After all, reliability of our institutions is a comfort that consumers derive, so far.

  “They were very nice, kind, thoughtful, generous,” she said. "And Adan, he always had a smile on his face and it brought joy to all the people. He was amazing. Every time I’ve seen him he always had a joke up his sleeve. He was was really, really nice and I enjoyed seeing him around.”


  She recounted one time when she was playing football with a group of friends and she fell.


  “He helped me and picked me up. He was a very good sport about things, too,” she said.


  Her brother Eddie also has fond memories of playing football with Adan during recess.

"(Hofstra coach) Joe Mihalich referred to him as a Rodman-type player," Young said. "Mutts is a good basketball player. We're going to do some more things with him offensively around the basket. He's a lot stronger than he looks and can get up over the top of folks and score the ball."
 Interim head coach Jim Ferry, who was promoted when Patrick Chambers resigned in October, prefers for Penn State to get out and run past folks. The Nittany Lions like to push the ball after misses and makes as everyone except the ballhandler finds a place outside the 3-point arc to spot up.
 Penn State built a 29-10 lead in the opening nine minutes Sunday night against Seton Hall by drilling 7 of 11 of its 3-pointers -- each one by a different player.
 But the Nittany Lions' lack of size and depth eventually was exposed. Seton Hall outscored Penn State 54-30 in the paint for the night, yet the Nittany Lions still held an 8-point lead with just under two minutes to go.
 "We've got to learn how to finish games," Ferry said. "We should have won in regulation. We can't just outscore people. We have to defend and rebound. When we do that, I think we can be very good.
 "I thought we were playing so tight (in the first half) making extra passes -- making great passes for each other. Then, all of a sudden, guys started looking for shots for themselves. We missed some layups, we turned the ball over."

If watching your family shovel roast dinner into their mouths via Zoom doesn't appeal, get the same vibe in a more structured way with tasting menus. Simply buy the same cheeseboard or dessert platter and sample it together over Zoom, or buy an organised tasting experience for each participating home, with options from cheese and chocolate to gin or wine. It'll give you something to talk about and share, plus you'll get fed.
 ## Playing together
 Some board games translate well to Zoom, but others really don't. If you need a shared pot of anything, such as _Scrabble_ letters or cards in _Ticket to Ride_ , it's not worth the trouble. But simpler games can work. _Yahtzee_ only requires each location to have a set of dice and to draw out the score card, while _Monopoly_ can be managed from a single location, with players directing the host with the moves they'd like to make. To share a view of the board, you'll need a camera with a top-down view; it may be worth investing in an overhead smartphone tripod kit to hold your phone.
 Alternatively, find your favoured game on a digital platform such as Tabletopia or Board Game Arena. Simpler games such as Charades or Pictionary can easily be managed using an online topic generator, while there's web-based Scattergories category makers.

This is especially harmful because even if they are not littered directly on the beach, they often get washed into the ocean. According to Hamilton, 80 percent of marine plastic pollution comes from onshore sources.
 “You don’t have to go to the beach to conduct a clean-up. Throughout COVID, we’ve been advocating for our members to practice solo community cleanups or physical distance cleanups where they go to their favorite park or their neighborhood or the alley way adjacent to their home and clean up,” Hamilton said. “If the trash doesn’t get removed there, it’s invariably going to end up on the beach after the first rain of the season.”
 The Surfrider Foundation advocates for people to not only get involved in plastic clean-ups, but to also change their consumer choices toward reusable goods. Although California and Santa Monica—as well as Malibu—have been pioneers in the fight against plastic, part of that progress has been lost over the course of the pandemic.
 “Plastic has infiltrated vertically every nook and cranny of our planet, ranging from the purest air in the world in the Alps to the lowest level of the marine food web in phytoplankton. We are finding plastic in our table salt, we are finding it in our municipal water, we are finding it throughout marine food webs,” Hamilton described. “The impacts of the plastic pollution pandemic cannot be overstated.”

HUNTINGTON — Three men have pleaded guilty in federal court this week for unrelated drug and firearm offenses, one of which included the illegal sale of a firearm to a minor.
 Kelly Ray Ingels Sr., 46, of Huntington, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm and transfer of a firearm to a juvenile.
 According to U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart, Ingels sold a firearm to a juvenile for cash and marijuana over Facebook on May 20. During an investigation surrounding that sale, officers obtained a search warrant for his home at 920 ½ 23rd Street in Huntington. During the execution of that search warrant, officers located about 11 grams of meth and digital scales.
 During an interview, Ingels admitted to possessing the meth for sale. He said he suffers from substance use disorder at the time he possessed and sold the gun to the juvenile.
 He faces up to 31 years in prison at his March 1 sentencing.
 In an unrelated case, Kevin Holmes Jr., 31, of Huntington, pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.
 According to Stuart, a Huntington police officer pulled a vehicle Holmes was operating over Dec. 22, 2019, around the intersection of 20th Street and 6th Avenue in Huntington. After finding there were warrants for his arrest, the officer asked him to exit the vehicle. However, Holmes fled on foot. He was quickly captured and arrested.

It’s a little early for a celebration, but I think starting early is appropriate (assuming we celebrate over a Zoom call or observe social distancing while doing so). It’s not so much that I am ready to ring in the pending new year as much as I am eager to say goodbye to this one. It’s been a doozy.
 As we all have adapted to this thing we are calling the “new normal” - you know - where you fearfully enter restaurants, forego going to movies (are the theaters even open?), where concerts and events have been suspended and where sectors of the economy have been devastated. I’ve faced a number of setbacks of my own. Taken together with a contentious election, a greater rift between Americans over politics than ever before, where members of Congress have become less and less collegial and seem to get swept in based on who yells the loudest, and where a stimulus bill to help Americans was DOA due to a pending election, it’s been maddening.
 On the personal front, I faced a pretty severe health scare in September. It’s the usual stuff that middle-aged men who don’t eat right, who don’t exercise right and who don’t take care of themselves and work in high stress occupations face, but let me say unequivocally, it’s not the usual stuff when it happens to you. So, after three heart stents courtesy of an amazing cardiologist with the Tennova Healthcare system and his qualified team, I dodged the proverbial bullet – for now anyway.
 But the hits kept coming. My parents are not particularly well and need more care than ever before. My retired brother (who is not known for his tolerance or patience) has really stepped up to the plate. It’s been challenging for him as he thought he was retiring early enough to enjoy some travel and do the things he enjoys, but he finds himself in the kitchen cooking meals, cleaning dishes and washing clothes and cleaning constantly for three.
 As much as it pains me, I may nominate him for sainthood. He’s dealing with our parents, after all, and if the Catholic masses knew our parents, I think they’d approve the nomination (despite the fact that we’re Methodists, and really bad ones at that). St. Scott has a nice ring to it, too.
 Though 2020 has been particularly unpleasant for our family, I mustered up the strength to express thanks last week that at least I still have my parents, and that I was in the right place at the right time when my ticker lost its timing. I have a job I am thankful for and people I am happy to be able to work with, and a great support team in my wife and daughters. In many ways, there are others who had it worse in this unprecedented year.
 I think about the restaurant owners, the restaurant workers, the gig economy workers who can’t play on Music Row, who can’t host art shows, who can’t sell concessions at concerts and ball games.
 I think about the families who lost loved ones and who couldn’t convene with their fellow family members to bury their loved ones.
 I think about empty collection plates at church as people stay home to avoid interacting with others to protect themselves and their vulnerable family members.
 I think about the school kids, devastated by rolling closures and the lost educational and socialization time. I think about the parents of those kids, struggling to come to terms with how to provide for their children who have to learn “remotely” while they must go to work to provide.
 I also think about the soaring rates of alcohol and drug abuse and the havoc that is inflicting on families.
 Yes, as bad as 2020 has been I can count myself lucky.
 So as the year roars to its long-awaited, much anticipated demise, I am going to celebrate like it’s St. Patrick’s Easter de Mayo Fourth of Christmas Year’s Eve day in my Halloween costume. Who’s up for joining me on the Zoom call?

  # Council meets, appoints members to Housing Board


  Angie Talken


  Linn County Leader


  At a recent meeting of the Marceline City Council, the council voted unanimously to appoint two new members to the Marceline Housing Authority Board.


  Deana Maag was appointed to fill Dean Enyeart’s seat, which will expire May 31, 2022; and Jackie Schmitt was appointed to fill Paul Stark’s seat to expire May 31, 2024. Those appointments were effective immediately.


  The council also approved a bid for items to be covered with CARES Act funds from the county.


  City officials had sought bids for touchless hand dryers, along with soap and hand sanitizer dispensers to be installed in all city facilities. City staff will install the new items.


  The bid was accepted from Heartland Environmental for $37,342.40 to cover the cost of supplies only.


  Another bid for $7,193 was also accepted from Grand River Solutions for repairs to the roof at the Marcelin Business Complex. During the meeting, City Manager Richard Hoon noted the county has agreed to pay $5,000 and the city will cover the remaining costs. The bid covers repairs to the under-roofing and a rubber membrane underneath.


  The council also discussed the county’s health advisory, which asks residents to wear masks and continue to practice social distancing.


  Last Monday was the deadline for applications for city attorney.


  City Clerk Lindsay Krumpelman said that City Attorney William Devoy stepped down from his role as city attorney on Nov. 19.


  On Oct. 22, Gov. Mike Parson appointed William P. Devoy as associate circuit judge for the 9th Judicial Circuit, to fill the vacancy created by the death of Judge Scot T. Othic.


  Devoy, a Brookfield resident, was an Attorney at Elson & Devoy, P.C. His appointment became effective Dec. 1.


  Krumpleman said Devoy and his late law partner, Jeff Elson served the city since January 2015.


  The December council meeting will also be held at the Marceline Fire Barn to allow for social distancing.

Most Scrantonians won’t notice the difference directly if the school district and the city government follow through on restructuring business taxes. But the issue is far from abstract because the taxes involved are paid by employers.
 Scranton, because it remains a distressed city under the state’s Act 47, has the ability to switch from widely loathed business privilege and mercantile taxes, which are based on gross business receipts, to a tax based on a business’ total payroll.
 A referendum for such a switch passed easily two years ago and Lackawanna County Senior Judge Thomas J. Munley approved it Nov. 30 following a hearing at which no one opposed it.
 The Cognetti administration and many small businesses favor the switch because it widens the net for tax collection — including banks and manufacturers, for example, which are exempt under the current regimen — without increasing tax rates. The Pennsylvania Economy League, Scranton’s state-designated recovery coordinator, also favors the switch. Several analysts have said that the tax will produce more revenue without higher rates as payrolls grow. And, because it entails fewer variables regarding business activity, the tax is easier than the existing taxes to calculate and collect.
 But the switch is not problem-free. It would impose a new burden on many hard- pressed manufacturing businesses, for example, which already have substantial property tax burdens. And it could act as a disincentive for increased hiring, which is the last thing the city needs.
 To Mayor Paige Gebhardt Cognetti’s and school President Katie Gilmmartin’s credit, they have taken a cautious approach, ensuring that no change will be made before 2022. Cognetti has empaneled a commission to study the city’s entire structure, of which Gilmartin is a member, and it will include the business tax issue in its deliberations.
 There is no doubt that the city and school district, which share a common tax base, need to modernize the tax structure to improve fairness and increase revenue without further stressing an already strained local economy. They both deserve credit for a careful approach.

Gonzaga, the top-ranked team in the country, announced more schedule changes Sunday that go beyond the postponement of Saturday's showdown game against No. 2 Baylor.
 Because of a positive COVID-19 test to an unnamed Gonzaga player, as well as member of the team's traveling party, four Bulldogs home games now will be canceled, starting with a nonconference matchup against Tarleton on Tuesday.
 Gonzaga also will not play Thursday against Southern, Saturday against Northern Arizona and Dec. 14 against Idaho.
 Saturday's game, which was halted after the positive tests were revealed within the Gonzaga program, is expected to be rescheduled but no date has been selected.
 The Bulldogs have paused all team activities with a return date to practice unknown. The next game on Gonzaga's schedule is now a Dec. 19 matchup at Sioux Falls, S.D., against Iowa and potential player-of-the-year candidate Luka Garza. The Hawkeyes are currently the No. 3-ranked team in the country.
 Gonzaga is off to a 3-0 start this season with two victories already over top-25 teams. The Bulldogs defeated No. 7 Kansas 102-90 in their Nov. 26 opener, then topped No. 11 West Virginia 87-82 on Wednesday.

For the worst reason imaginable, President Donald Trump has threatened to veto the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act, the principal defense appropriations bill.
 Trump is upset because Republicans have let stand a provision in the bill that would mandate renaming 10 military installations that now are named for Confederate traitors who took up arms against the United States in the Civil War, and oversaw the killing of hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops —all in the cause of maintaining human slavery.
 The posts in question are Camp Beauregard and Fort Polk, Louisiana; Fort Benning and Fort Gordon, Georgia; Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Lee and Fort Pickett, Virginia; Fort Rucker, Alabama, and Fort Hood, Texas. The installations were named primarily during the south’s Jim Crow era.
 Beyond honoring people who tried to destroy the United States, Trump’s stance is odd even by his own personal standards, in that he often invokes an aversion to those he derisively calls “losers.”
 Constituents of representatives and senators of both parties have enormous stakes in the defense bill. Those legislators should not be deterred in passing the bill for the sake of those constituents and everyone’s stake in national security.
 Trump also has threatened to veto the bill unless Congress changes liability standards for social media platforms, one of his pet peeves. Those standards should be modified, but that is a separate matter that has nothing to do with defense.
 Congress should call the lame duck Trump’s bluff, pass the defense bill and prepare for an override if he vetoes it.

Oropesa was already in Milan and two weeks into rehearsals when the fall virus resurgence shut down theaters. Even before the partial lockdown in Lombardy, the theater had been hit by a virus outbreak that eventually infected 43 chorus singers and 18 musicians. That made staging the full opera —even to an empty theater as other theaters have done — too big a health risk. Management opted for a gala evening of star singers and ballet dancers, mostly recorded in segments in advance.
 “By the time you get to the rehearsals as an opera singer, you have done 90% of the work,” Oropesa said. “We were doing a version of the role I have never done before in different keys higher than I usually sing. To get there, and start digesting the staging, and the costumes and to stop it midway is like cooking the turkey for Thanksgiving, and someone turns it off halfway done.”
 Oropesa counts herself lucky she is working at all in a season of rolling theater shutdowns that has left many singers and musicians struggling to get by.
 After about a decade at the Metropolitan Opera, where she was part of the young artists program and made her debut at age 22, she shifted her career toward Europe. Her knowledge of Spanish helped ease her into the Italian repertoire, and her New Orleans upbringing boosted her with the French. Oropesa’s international breakthrough role was as Lucia di Lammermoor at the Royal Opera House in London in 2017, and since then she has performed in Madrid, the Paris Opera and La Scala, while keeping up ties at the Met.
 In 2019, she was the recipient of two prestigious opera awards — the Beverly Sills Artist Award for rising young singers and the Richard Tucker Award.
 But 2020 has been different for everyone. Oropesa was four performances into a six-date run as Violetta in “La Traviata” at the Met when it closed due to the virus last spring. And she sang at the Vienna Staatsoper in October just before Austria’s lockdown put the season on hiatus.
 Friends back in the United States, where theaters have been on a tight shutdown all year, have had it tougher, she said, generating income when they can with singing lessons and virtual concerts, but also as Uber drivers and construction workers.
 Oropesa said her career was just established enough to help her find work more easily.
 “I was fortunate enough to kind of be in the right place at the right time,’’ she said. “I lost a lot of things, too. I lost Lucia in Milan. I have lost New Year’s eve stuff.
 “You lose one, you get another. If you are lucky you break even.”

This win was both hard-fought and character-driven after a very poor opening 30 minutes with the visitors looking comfortable on both sides of the ball. It didn’t help matters that, somehow, Ireland missed a scarcely believable 15 tackles in that period alone.
 Then, out of nowhere, it appeared as if Ireland flipped a switch and played their best rugby for some time, full of attacking intent and bristling with a continuity that forced the visitors into a concession of penalties in their defensive zone. In the circumstances, it was inevitable that a yellow card would be brandished by English referee Matthew Carley with Scottish centre Duncan Taylor the deserved victim.
 Ireland used that period well, racking up eight points which served to set the tone for a far more positive half-time debrief. However, a big worry for Farrell has been a succession of poor performances in the third quarter of games which, in recent seasons, had always been consistently rewarding.
 How welcome then to see Ireland sprinting out of the blocks with two tries in six minutes immediately after the break, complementing the first of a brace from the excellent Keith Earls in the dying embers of the first half. In effect, that 12-minute blitz finished the game as a contest.
 It was also pleasing to see Ireland not only play with far greater width to their game but to recover their composure after a lapse of concentration from Rob Herring off a defensive ruck which gifted Duhan van der Merwe a cheap try, at a time when they looked as if they were about to step up to another level.
 This has been a hugely demanding and intense period of international action with six tests in seven weeks. That doesn’t happen very often and was made even more challenging by the necessity to live, for all intents and purposes, in isolation for nearly two months. That in itself is exhausting without having to deal with the demands of hitting peak performance on the back of so little rugby over the previous five months.
 What the period has confirmed is that, right now, Ireland are the best of the rest with a fifth-place world ranking behind England and France on this side of the world along with South Africa and New Zealand. I’m sure Australia and Argentina, in sixth and eighth place respectively, would fancy their chances against us right now.
 To his credit, Farrell has handed opportunities to 42 different players in his first year in charge and, of more importance, introduced 11 new caps to the demands of test rugby.
 That will stand to him in the forthcoming Six Nations when, hopefully, the likes of Tadhg Furlong, Dave Kilcoyne, Dan Leavy, Garry Ringrose, and Jordon Larmour could all be available for selection after injury.
 After a tetchy week in camp, with Farrell clearly irked by the fall-off in performance in a really disappointing second half against a very average Georgian side that yielded just three points, the pressure was on Ireland to finish this campaign on a high.
 As captain, Johnny Sexton threw the gauntlet down to his players when he came out swinging in his press conference during the week, insisting that serious progress has been made over a very productive period working together.
 In the circumstances, you can be certain coach and captain highlighted the need to explode from the traps to sow seeds of doubts in the minds of the Scottish players who, despite an appalling record against us with only one win from the last nine tests between the sides, always appear to believe they have a divine right to beat Ireland.
 In the circumstances, the composure Ireland displayed in not only absorbing the poor start, but the defensive shortcomings early on and the concession of that soft try scored against the run of play, showed ample character when dominating proceedings from that moment onwards.

Giuliani's son Andrew tweeted Sunday that his father was "resting, getting great care and feeling well." Andrew Giuliani, who works in the White House, tested positive for the virus late last month.
 The Trump lawyer's diagnosis was also a day after the president, who long played down the severity of the pandemic and even mocked those who wore masks, held his first big political rally since the election — before a tightly packed crowd of thousands of largely unmasked supporters in Georgia.
 White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx expressed frustration Sunday at anti-mask sentiment in the US.
 "I hear community members... parroting back that masks don't work," she told NBC's "Meet the Press."
 "They are wrong."
 The United States — the country with the most coronavirus cases and deaths in the world — has seen a dramatic resurgence in its epidemic in recent weeks.
 For the third day in a row, the United States on Saturday notched a record number of coronavirus cases in 24 hours, reaching nearly 230,000 new infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
 A series of members of Trump's inner circle have contracted the disease since the president himself caught it weeks before the election.
 They include his wife Melania, his son Donald Jr., his son Barron, his press secretary, some of his advisers, his campaign manager as well as several Republican members of Congress.
 Many of them, including Giuliani, followed Trump's example, often ignoring health experts' guidance and attending White House and political events without masks.
 David Gergen, a senior adviser in four US administrations, noted on CNN that while dozens of people around Trump had now contracted the virus, only one or two in Biden's camp had done so.
 The lesson, Gergen said: "The cavalier attitude taken by the Trump people is only going to get you closer to catching this stuff...
 "It's just as plain as it can be."

The bases, the report added, are highly vulnerable to ambush, given their remote locations, and could be targeted by both US and Japanese long-range missile systems, or by naval forces in the region. And even were the islands themselves not attacked, they would be simple to blockade, starving forces of their supplies.
 "Island shelters lack vegetation, natural rock and soil and other coverings, and the altitude is low, while the groundwater level is high. Personnel and resources cannot be stored underground for a long time," the report said, adding that any shelters built on the bases would have "very limited" anti- strike capabilities.
 There are also other issues which make defense of the islands exceptionally difficult, said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst in defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
 "The harsh environmental conditions in the South China Sea -- salt water corrosion, poor weather -- make it almost impossible to deploy anything on the islands in a manner that could allow them to defend these bases," he said, adding that hugely expensive, complicated aircraft would be next to unserviceable "within a week or so on these islands."
 He said that while some islands may be effective as shooting platforms, they would be among the first targets if a conflict was to occur in the South China Sea, and it is "just physically impossible to build an island that is essentially defensible" given the type of reefs and sandbars originally there.
 "What the Chinese are trying to do is annex an international maritime space, to control and own international waters, and to do that they need to have a permanent presence there," Davis said. "But it is becoming evident that while they may have been enough to make the territorial claim, they're actually not a practical step in the long term because they can't actually defend those bases."
 Of course, Beijing may rely on the fact that any attack against a base in the South China Sea -- even an outpost considered illegal under international law -- would be tantamount to an act of war against a nuclear power with vast military resources. The threat of retaliation may be sufficient to prevent the island bases from facing any attack.
 Nor would China be the only country with vulnerable bases far from its mainland that are could be taken out by early strikes. The US island of Guam and the Japanese island of Okinawa, where there are major US air bases, are both within range of Chinese missile attack, something Beijing has reminded Washington of in the past.

A top 10 of the AP college football poll with Indiana and Iowa State is something never before seen.


  The eighth-ranked Hoosiers and No. 10 Cyclones both moved up two spots in the Top 25 on Sunday, heights those programs have not reached in decades.


  The last time Iowa State cracked the top 10 was 1992, when the Cyclones reached No. 9 after a 6-1 start to the season that included an upset of Nebraska. Iowa State finished that season 1-6 and unranked.


  The regular season is over for these Cyclones (8-2). Their next game will be in the Big 12 championship game against No. 13 Oklahoma.


  It has been even longer since Indiana was ranked this highly. The Hoosiers peaked at No. 4 in 1969, when they last played in the Rose Bowl. That prize is off the table this season because the Rose Bowl is hosting a College Football Playoff semifinal. The Big Ten championship game could still be within their reach, depending on what happens with Ohio State and the conference's minimum games rule.

  Triple H continued discussing the matches on the show praising the storytelling of the War Games matches surrounding the action and spots. He also gave his praise for the other matches on the card as well.


  "I was just saying to talent backstage that it's hard to perform in this environment and this timeframe with where we are in the world, with limited fans and everything else," Triple H noted. The storytelling, to me, is where it's at. That last War Games match, these things are always trainwrecks. When the story is great, and this last one was very story driven, it was about all of these interactions between these talents and their story. And that's what I loved about it. It wasn't just about the spots, and that's what makes it.


  "To me, I thought the women had an unbelievable night, maybe the greatest division anywhere. Tommaso Ciampa-Timothy Thatcher put on a clinic. [Dexter] Lumis and [Cameron] Grimes, what a hell of Strap Match. It was very physical different, and then Leon [Ruff], Damian [Priest] and Johnny [Gargano], again, telling an amazing story that I don't think you can all the way through. And Johnny's making history becoming a three-time champion. Leon being made. Damian Priest putting on another monster performance. Everybody got over tonight across the board."


  Candice LeRae appeared to be injured during the women's War Games match. Triple H confirmed that LeRae was getting checked out during the time of the call, and he suspected that she suffered a broken arm. He noted that there were mainly bumps and bruises for the other talent, which he called a success considering the dangers that can come from these types of shows.


  "Candice is getting checked out now," Triple H said. "Getting checked out and getting an x-ray so I don't have status update yet on that, but you are correct. It looks like possibly a broken arm. We're not sure yet, but we'll see where that goes. Bobby Fish got a little bit of laceration on his elbow, but we're not exactly sure. But it's just the elbow, so we're kind of just waiting and seeing, but other than that, just bumps and bruises. I hold my breath on this kinds of shows every single time. If that is the extent of it, then we did well."

Netflix said that it has no plans to add a disclaimer to its flagship series, The Crown, stating the show is fictionalised, as per reports.


  Oliver Dowden, United Kingdom’s Cultural Secretary had called on Netflix to label the drama focusing on the royal family as “fictional,” as per reports.


  In an interview with the _Daily Mail_ , Dowden urged Netflix to put a disclaimer at the beginning of the episodes of "The Crown" alerting viewers that the royal drama was "a work of fiction."


  Dowden had also written a private letter on the matter. Netflix had replied to the letter privately, _Variety_ reported.


  The media giant said that it has no plans to add a disclaimer claiming that the drama series is a work of fiction as it is “broadly based on historical events,” as per the report.


  “We have always presented ‘The Crown’ as a drama – and we have every confidence our members understand it’s a work of fiction that’s broadly based on historical events,” a Netflix spokesperson told Variety. “As a result we have no plans and see no need to add a disclaimer.”

To start a group, you'll need to be watching on a browser or in the mobile app, but you can join a movie party on your smart TV once someone invites you via the app. Amazon Prime has a similar tool called Watch Party.
 Netflix doesn't have that feature built-in, but Teleparty – formerly known as Netflix Party – and Metastream will sync streams and start a chat group for Netflix and other streaming services. For all these options, each viewer will need their own subscription. It's worth noting these third-party apps will only work in a browser, not on your TV. If all of this sounds like a bit of effort to fall asleep watching _Home Alone_ , it may be simpler to start at roughly the same time and just chat over a messaging app instead.
 If your traditions are more theatrical, there's a wide range of pantomimes and other stage shows that have gone virtual, offering live streaming or watch on demand. Shakespeare's Globe is offering its _Christmas at the (Snow) Globe_ show in both formats, and there's an interactive version of _Cinderella_ from a service called PantoLive that has singalongs and a costume contest.

The proposal is expected to include the $300 per week in bonus federal unemployment payments, providing relief just as emergency aid payments at regular benefit levels are set to expire at year's end. It would extend a freeze on evictions for people who cannot pay their rent and reauthorize the Paycheck Protection Program to give a second round of subsidies to businesses struggling through the pandemic.
 Still, potential sticking points remain.
 Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said last week they wouldn't support the $908 billion proposal if it did not include checks for families, and were joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are also against shielding businesses from lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks, a provision pushed by Republicans.
 While favoring the $1,200 checks, Biden said the emerging compromise was "immediately needed" and that additional assistance could follow later.
 On Sunday, lawmakers involved in the negotiations said the direct payments would have to wait until after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. At that time, Biden will face a new Congress as vaccines are being distributed, with a narrowed Democratic majority in the House and a closely divided Senate potentially split 50-50 if Democrats are able to prevail in two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.
 Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Sanders was not involved in the negotiations and "his characterization is just not accurate" about the potential liability protections for businesses. The direct payments, he said, will be a task for Biden.
 Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said the bipartisan group was focused on extending the most urgent aid for the next four months.
 "Every indication says more money is needed; we see that," he said. "This gets us through basically the lifelines that people need and the small businesses that can survive and not go under."
 Manchin said Biden's team, when in power, "can put together a different proposal that takes us further down the road for more recovery."
 Durbin spoke on ABC's "This Week," Cassidy appeared on "Fox News Sunday," Warner was on CNN's "State of the Union" and Manchin was interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press.

A series of hauntingly beautiful photographs - of deserted crossroads, empty marketplaces and places of worship without their worshippers - adorn the walls of the Italian Embassy Cultural Centre giving viewers a glimpse of a Delhi they have never seen before.A stark reminder of the early days of the coronavirus-induced lockdown in the national capital, the India- Italy photo exhibition titled "Present Absent" showcases 18 works by Delhi- based photographer Parul Sharma.Sharma has captured the tall columns of the Connaught Place drawing longer shadows in the corridors, a quiet Jama Masjid standing in wait for its usual gatherings, and the posh Khan Market in south Delhi among other iconic places in the national capital.She stepped out to capture Delhi in its isolated self and ended up with over 10,000 photographs of the time when the country was only at the beginning of a global pandemic.For her, it was either to sit at home and be inspired by other photographers' work or live the reality of the situation to be inspired."I decided to live the reality. It was almost like a warlike situation, going out, interacting with people while not knowing when you may contract the virus," Sharma told PTI."And, I have seen a Delhi not many have ever seen," she added.A nostalgia of growing up in Old and New Delhi around the vintage photo collection of her grandfather inspired Sharma to capture the photographs in black and white."Looking at these photos you can't say they are Delhi 2020 or Delhi 1950, because Delhi looked like this and there were fewer people back then," she said.With the "Present Absent", the Italian Embassy Cultural Centre has opened the gates for public for the first time since the lockdown.Apart from Sharma's tableaux of photographs, the exhibition has also showcased nine works by different Italian photographers that show famous squares from Italian cities including Florence, Rome, and Vatican during the lockdown period.Part of an original project conceived by Marco Delogu, director of the Fotografia festival in Rome, the nine photographs of the Italian squares are accompanied by texts by Italian writers including Pulitzer Prize-winning Indian-origin author Jhumpa Lahiri, who lives in Rome."These pictures show places that are very crowded throughout the year. It was only because of the lockdown that we had an opportunity to capture the stillness," said Andrea Baldi, director of Italian Embassy Cultural Centre.The exhibition will come to a close on December 10.
