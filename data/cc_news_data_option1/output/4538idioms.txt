And all of our bolt-ons are pointed towards how do we help great agents do more business through efficiency and the use of big data. So that's really what we've been working on behind the scenes quite extensively and everything from the first app to - on the Motto side with wemlo where we control lot of the efficiencies, we control a lot of the information behind the scenes in order to help our agents do what they do best which is that work with the customer in a highly emotional process of the home buying and selling situation as well as being that expert counselor during that process and leading in and out of that process.

Paul has used the downtime to master brow-blocking and winged eyeliner and perfect his foundation technique. Like a lot of drag artists, he uses a few different shades of Kryolan TV Paint Stick to contour and highlight his face. The range provides great coverage, he says, but it tends to cake around his nose. The trick, he recently discovered, is to use MAC Studio Fix foundation on the nose and under-eye area, and TV Paint Stick on the rest of his face. “I’m overjoyed to have learned that little trick,” he says, “because it was knocking my confidence when I was doing drag or TV work.”

Yeah Doug, we'll have some preliminary small markets in the first quarter, but we won't have poor - it'll be the third quarter before we have a major market up and running probably the worlds can touch and feel a little bit that to see what we're doing. But I think the big picture Doug, is that we're running pretty fast internally. That's not visible obviously to all of our investors and to the Street and it's not - there's so much detail and so many things that go into it. We've strategically said we're focused on just getting the job done. And we - there's not great forums for us to communicate in the world of COVID because we're - for us to show you what we're doing, you really got to see it. It's not a PowerPoint presentation.

It doesn’t matter how ugly a team wins a game, it’s still chalked up in the W column when it’s all said and done.
 And the Wisconsin Dells prep football team stands by the mantra because the Chiefs threw three interceptions – two in the red zone – a block in the back penalty that negated an interception return for a touchdown and one turnover on downs during Friday’s non-conference game against Viroqua.
 But even with all the mental mistakes throughout the game, the Chiefs still prevailed, edging the Blackhawks 8-0 at Wisconsin Dells Middle School.
 “A battle in the trenches – sometimes they get ugly, but, yeah, definitely not pretty,” Wisconsin Dells coach Mike Janke said. “It was turnovers, turnovers, turnovers, which is relatively characteristic for us this year.”

Our customers don't want to pay more money. So we fight for our customers. And you never have a discussion about how you can build a better product for the customer where maybe the programmer can make more money and we can give a better product to the customers. And we're - I think we're going to be able to do that in the wireless business. And it's kind of a breath of fresh air. And when - the only reason I say that is the timing gets muddier in terms of - we know where we have to be. And if we can't get there with somebody will - but at some point, we know that as we get better and better, more and more companies will take a chance on us because of our successful they're in the driver's seat. And now somebody's got to prime - the next guy's going to prime out with driver's seat.

Tree leaves are most-recognized and appreciated when they go through their fall color blitz that we enjoy every year. But they should also be recognized for all they do throughout the year, including creating food and fiber through the miracle of photosynthesis, and when dead on the ground they supply the raw materials needed for next year’s growth of new leaves. Going from dead leaves to nutrients that can be taken up by the tree requires a recycling system of decomposition.
 Plants need certain chemicals to grow and produce food that sustains the entire forest ecological system. Calcium, nitrogen, phosphorous, and many other elements are taken up from soil by plant roots. These elements enter the soil through the recycling of dead vegetation, animal carcasses, and animal wastes that accumulate on the ground as organic litter. A complex community of bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and many other kinds of micro-beasties that live in the soil carry out the vital task of decomposition that ultimately leads to what is called biogeochemical cycling. This is where organic material is finally broken down to individual atoms that can move from the soil and be taken up by plant roots.
 The carpet of dried leaves, twigs, and other debris that covers the forest floor is called the litter layer, and here is where recycling begins. If you dig into it you will note that the upper layer is made up of leaves that are more or less intact. Newly fallen leaves contain a great deal of potential food energy that is tapped by the many inhabitants in the soil.
 As you dig deeper in the litter layer, the leaves will become increasingly moist and flimsier. Deeper still the leaves become increasingly skeletonized, where all the softer tissue has been broken down, leaving only the tougher veins and stem. Decomposing leaves become darker in color and feel slimy due to a coating of microorganisms. If you look closer you may notice thin, white threads growing on the leaf surfaces, produced by the many fungi that consume dead material. On down the leaves become broken up and unrecognizable. The litter here is dark, gritty, and moist. This is the humus layer and is where organic matter from formerly living things finally becomes the simple chemicals that can be taken up by plants to make them go.
 I do not mean to sound overly profound, but in the forest, death is as important as life. And while decaying things may smell bad and are often shunned by us humans, without this important recycling process, life as we know it could not exist.

Thank you. Charlie, in the other days, you said that you were not going to start building a network until you knew who you're building it for that you would ultimately partner up with an anchor tenant that would be the sort of the first user of the network. Is that still the case? And if so, I think initially you said you needed to get a commercial trial up and running before you sort of selected one of those anchor tenants. Is that something you would do after running a couple of small markets in the beginning of 2021? Or is it something that has to wait until later during the year?

We have spent a significant amount of money this year under $100 million, but approaching $100 million on stock repurchases. We have done and Kevin ticked off some of this, spent in the upper hundreds of millions on small deals and non-television station acquisitions that are all accretive across the Board, and yet, we are going to be in a position to close the year out with, as I said, close to $0.75 billion in cash.

First of all big question, yeah, hey, I think we are cash flow positive in the wireless business this quarter. So at least in the retail side, so - and that was unexpected - I set out a challenge to our team for the first year with boost to basically break even, we obviously have - the way we run our business with an input - when we pay for a network versus perhaps [indiscernible] would be - there are differences, sorry, there are customers that are not economical to us. And obviously, we have to get that - we are now on a lot of sprint systems, we got to put those systems in ourselves. And John and team are working on that. So I think that the retail business - big pitcher is retail business could be a profitable business, shouldn't be negative –should not be a negative business. I'm not saying one has the months and bounds to get there. But it should be a part of - should actually be a very profitable business.

These chatty, candid individuals are mostly not professionals but simply skincare boffins. They follow the likes of established beauty blogger Caroline Hirons, the 51-year-old Londoner who has won millions of fans thanks to her honest, no-holds-barred assessment of products and affable personality. Skinfluencers like Hirons and this new clutch of Tik Tok stars have the authenticity factor in spades, something that big brands are scrambling to attain as the glossy veneer of the beauty industry wears thin. With salons and spas closed for much of the year, they’ve also filled the gap for consumers who aren’t able to consult with the professionals, with the result that skincare-related videos have surged by more than 1000pc on Tik Tok, year on year.

So Charlie, thank you so much. That helps a lot. But I think another piece of the puzzle that the people are wondering about is where the money comes from? If you don't really have more than one big market up and running by third quarter next year, then you need to prove out the technology or you need to burn in the commercial go-to-market strategy. And then maybe money comes in to support this in 2022, like, what's the financial -

It's all levels of their companies and they're taking a chance on us and we recognize that and - but we all are in there, and is this going pay dividends for them. And we all take the approach that we're going to help make their business better, and they're committed to help make our business better. So we're building a great team of partners and vendors. And then we're planning our build out. Behind the scenes that - it's published, and we have one tower up, but we're planning it and a really good network starts with planning. And while we wish we had supply of radios today, because we are ready to deploy in certain markets. We're dependent on those, O-RAN radios from Fujitsu. Those don't arrive in mass till the second half of next year. So in the meantime, that allows us to get our planning done our permitting done and then it'll appear to you, second half of next year, they're running pretty fast. But making it behind the scenes running fast now are putting all those things in place to do that.

I know my limitations.
 I can change a light switch, but I cannot install a breaker. I can carry a tune, but I would never subject you to listening to me sing. I can do all kinds of math in my head, but I never took calculus.
 Mental math. Yes, that’s my talent. Abracadabra.
 And until last week, I thought I was perfectly capable of buying jeans.
 That turned out not to be the case.
 I don’t have to try on jeans anymore before I buy them. I always get the same style and size. I’ve been wearing the same style and size for several years.
 It’s not often that I actually buy any. I’m not too rough on them. And nowadays, the worse they look, the more they look like they came right off the shelf.
 Still, I do like to try and buy jeans that at least look like they didn’t participate in the Normandy invasion.
 Back when I was a kid, we all wore Tuf Nut jeans. They were navy blue with reinforced knees and were as stiff as a board. You could lean them up against the wall.
 I’m not an advocate of going back to the Tuf Nut days by any means. But something between them and the way the average pair looks would be fine with me.
 During my latest shopping experience I found one pair that would do fairly quickly. And not too long after that, I found another.
 Bingo. Case closed for at least 18 months.
 I wore the first pair, and they fit exactly the way they should fit.
 The day I pulled out the second new pair to wear for the first time, I knew something was wrong as soon as I touched them.
 They were stretchy.
 Now I don’t mind a little give. (Are you listening, Tuf Nut?)
 But this is ridiculous.
 They might as well be one size fits all, like a knit skull cap or a pair of socks. Don’t we have clothing sizes for a reason?
 Though I haven’t tried, I have no doubt whatsoever I will be able to put them on and take them off without ever unbuttoning them.
 Maybe the fire department could invest in some to speed up their response time.
 And when I wear them, they just feel… wrong for lack of a better word.
 I mean comfort is one thing, but I think I would enjoy a kilt more than this.
 They have no backbone, no will, no character. They’re a pushover.
 They’re yoga jeans for heaven’s sake.
 I could shoplift a piano.
 Maybe I could start a Saturday morning kids’ show and call it “The Misadventures of Mr. Rubberpants.”
 I thought about taking them back, but oh, no. Just like a 9-year-old, I tore the tags off before I ever put them on.
 But in my defense, I wasn’t expecting them to fit like long johns.
 And here’s what I predict. I will never get the first stain on them. My phone will never rub a hole in the back pocket. They will never get frayed around the back of the hem.
 They will be indestructible. They will last forever.
 And if I know me, I’ll wear them forever.

Health measures are loosening in several COVID-19 hot spots today as Ontario's new tiered system takes effect.
 The colour-coded system -- which classifies each public health unit as a red, orange, yellow or green zone based on caseload and transmission levels -- came into force at midnight, as previous measures imposed on a handful of hot spots were set to expire.
 Only Peel Region, which has seen rising cases in recent weeks, was deemed a red zone, while other hot spots such as York Region and Ottawa were labelled as orange.
 Regions in the red category have, among other things, indoor restaurant dining limited to 10 people and gyms limited to 10 people indoors.

Although aggressive measures and occupation by the Israeli regime across the Palestinian territories are nothing new, settlement projects in the West Bank lands, which are even labeled by the UN as Palestinian, have always been a point of controversy. The settlement is so important in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict that the UAE officials in formalizing their normalization with the Israelis said that they have agreed to a thaw with Tel Aviv under the condition that the Israelis will end settlement projects and West Bank annexation. But now an official announcement about a new project in West Bank by the Israelis shows that despite the normalization with the Emiratis, Tel Aviv has no plan to halt settlement construction in the Palestinian region that would be a prelude to annex West Bank to the already-occupied territories.

As it relates to the T-Mobile sites that we're getting visibility off, that is a rolling forecast where T-Mobile is providing that on a rolling basis. As they look at decommissioning those sites. They're giving us visibility of those sites. And we take that into consideration as we evaluate market-by- market, site-by-site, we look at search rings that is not a prerequisite for our design, we actually do our design. We do our plan independent of that. But then we take it into consideration as we look at candidates for those sites to see if they're a better option than what we otherwise have. So that's the approach that we take.
