Legendary shooter Abhinav Bindra believes once the coronavirus pandemic subsides, it could be a blessing in disguise for Indian sports due to absence of much foreign exposure."The post-COVID-19 world could be a blessing in disguise for India. There may not be so much foreign exposure and this may allow India to build proper sporting infrastructure. We need to build our own coaches and our own support staff," Bindra said on Monday.The entire sporting calendar has come to a grinding halt across the world due to the coronavirus pandemic. Major sporting events, including Tokyo Olympics and Wimbledon, have either been postponed or cancelled. Bindra, India's only individual Olympic gold medallist, alongwith Nandan Kamath, lawyer and managing trustee GoSports Foundation, on Monday addressed the newly-appointed assistant directors and other senior officials of Sports Authority of India (SAI) during a special session.Bindra said that as sports administrators they need to work towards creating an alternate skill development programme for athletes to ensure their well-being in the long run. "We need to look after athletes because the very nature of sport is that more will fail than succeed. It is important that athletes have backup plans in case their sports career doesn't work out," he pointed out. Bindra further said that sports administrators need to understand the psychology of an athlete to be able to build them up because athletes pass through different phases because of the nature of sport and the probability of failure. "An expert can give a larger overview of the various elements that go into sporting performance and that's where you will understand where performance is built and what are the various elements that go into performance and then you will start to have a better and deeper understanding of where performance is built. Results at a competition cannot be the only denominator when planning for an Olympic Games or an Asian Games," he added.Bindra spoke at length on his experience as an athlete and also on the future of sports in India. "The one per cent (of athletes) makes all the difference in sport, and as our sports ecosystem starts maturing, we need to start focussing on that one percent for all athletes," he said.Stressing on the need to build a strong talent identification and nurturing programme, he added, "Getting foundations right is important, a lot of work on that has already been started with the Khelo India programme and also emphasis placed on junior programme of different sports.

After speaking to Arvinder Khurana, President, All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA), it became clear the government has decided that instead of letting offline shops open during the lockdown, they would rather have both the models unavailable to the consumers to buy non-essential items. The retailer body said they had written a letter to the country's MInistry, requesting them to allow service, repair and sale of mobile devices through the offline retailer. Khurana explained that, through this letter, they are reaching out to the government with their grievances, as the offline mobile sector is running losses to the tune of Rs 1,500 crore, which includes the accessories business as well.

The Asia-Pacific MICE industry generated revenue of $229.0 billion in 2017, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% to reach $441.1 billion by 2025. The growth of the Asia-Pacific MICE industry is driven by the massive increase in business activities such as client meetings, brand promotions, employee training activities & others, due to rapid rise in the tourism and hospitability sectors and surge in presence of corporate industries. Other significant factors that promote the growth of the market are rise in business travel coupled with change in lifestyle of business travelers to seek leisure trips, rapid urbanization, and increase in disposable incomes. Moreover, surge in government initiatives to promote SMEs and liberalization of market entry to increase FDIs are anticipated to further boost the growth of the industry. However, high cost associated with MICE events and uncertain geopolitical conditions hamper the market growth.

 TOPEKA -- Locked-down businesses, surging unemployment and consternation about a possible coronavirus recession Monday prompted downgrading of Kansas' tax revenue projections in the next two years by $1.3 billion to force state lawmakers into the position of contemplating cataclysmic budget cuts.
   
 The group of economists and analysts responsible for revising state revenue estimates predicted tax collections in the fiscal year ending June 30 would be down by $815 million. In the fiscal year starting July 1, tax revenue was expected to drop off $549 million because of damage caused by COVID-19 in Kansas.
   
 These are record adjustments to tax revenue forecasts in Kansas and will wipe out most of the $925 million surplus in the state treasury. The bearish projections exceed the revenue collapse anticipated in 2016 due to income tax cuts signed into law by Gov. Sam Brownback.
   
 In anticipation of a bleak revenue forecast, Gov. Laura Kelly said she instructed state agencies Friday to eliminate discretionary spending, shelve requests for salary increases and leave vacant job openings not required during the pandemic. She requested fee-funded agencies of state government follow the same preemptive moves.
   
 "These initial steps are just the start of what will likely be needed to ensure long-term fiscal stability," the Democratic governor said.
   
 The Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, which met in private to update state government revenue projections last adjusted in November, pointed to anticipated decline in sales, income and oil-and-gas tax revenue. It was a sharp pivot from the group's expectations five months ago when their consensus was Kansas could expect steady employment, rising wages and economic growth into 2021.
   
 The 2020 Legislature and Kelly traditionally rely on the April updates of revenue forecasts to sort out budget details for each fiscal year starting July 1. It isn't clear whether the House and Senate will return next week to Topeka as scheduled to address the revenue shortfall or delay action until May or June when risk of infection may not be as great.
   
 "There's some tough decisions going forward," said Larry Campbell, the governor's budget director.
   
 A wildcard in the financial and political debate will be the amount of federal aid the state receives to soften economic fallout from COVID-19. It is also unclear when Kansas officials will authorize reopening of economic activity.
   
 "Lost jobs, business uncertainty and this unprecedented shortfall is a call for action," said Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita. "We need a plan to open up safely and we need it soon."
   
 Chamber's input
   
 The state's most prominent business advocacy organization recommends the plan for loosening and eliminating stay-at-home, mass-gathering and other statewide coronavirus restrictions set by Kelly must be keyed to public health metrics and accompanied by tax and regulatory relief.
   
 The Kansas Chamber, which represents businesses interests, endorsed a 40-point proposal that would condition movement back to normalcy with a requirement that the state's health care system be equipped to treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care.
   
 The state also should be able to test everyone with symptoms of COVID-19 and monitor confirmed cases and contacts, the chamber said. In addition, the organization said the decision on initiating commerce beyond essential business activities ought to be linked to a two-week reduction in case volume.
   
 "Kansas businesses closed because of the statewide stay-home order as well as those who have had to lay off or furlough employees are anxious to reopen and get back to work," said Alan Cobb, president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber, which has often been at odds with the governor on tax and budget policy. "But the health and safety of their employees and customers are a top priority."
   
 The chamber's list included a pause on state tax audits and a state tax break on coronavirus loans and grants to businesses. It ought to feature suspension of state or local inspections required to reopen a business temporarily closed because of COVID-19, Cobb said.
   
 He said the state should give business and residential property owners a 90-day extension on property tax payments. Consideration needs to be given to a tax credit to defray costs of out-of-pocket medical expenses for treatment of the virus. Business owners need liability protection from allegations by patrons who blame companies for contracting the virus, he said.
   
 The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported Monday that 100 Kansas residents have died and 1,986 have tested positive for the virus. Infection has been documented in 69 of the state's 105 counties, KDHE said.
   
 The outbreak at Lansing Correctional Facility widened to include 47 staff and 40 inmates, the Kansas Department of Corrections said. The agency also reported the first confirmed COVID-19 infection of a staff member at Topeka Correctional Facility, the prison housing women felons. In addition, a Wichita work release inmate who tested positive was transferred to Lansing.
   
 Virus 'body blow'
   
 David Toland, secretary of the Kansas Department of Commerce, said unraveling of the state's economic fabric occurred with speed and without exception.
   
 "Like most states," he said, "the Kansas economy has taken a body blow from COVID and that extended from the ag sector to manufacturing to the service sector, professionals. Everybody has been hit. It's urban, rural, suburban across the board."
   
 The state commerce department distributed $5 million in bridge loans to almost 350 hospitality businesses. The no-interest loans were designed to help bars, coffee shops and motels stay afloat until U.S. Small Business Administration loans became available or individual businesses could restructure bank debt. Demand for the state program called HIRE exceeded available cash: 1,000 applicants didn't get a piece of that pie.
   
 He said the federal Paycheck Protection Program in the SBA delivered forgivable loans to 20,000 Kansas businesses that averaged $187,000.
   
 That money won't have to be repaid if used to keep staff on the payroll during the pandemic, Toland said.
      
 The $350 billion earmarked nationally for PPP is gone, but congressional Democrats and the White House worked Sunday on a new relief package that included $300 billion to replenish the PPP fund. The legislation also is likely to contain $50 billion for the SBA's disaster relief fund, $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing.
   
 Toland said a separate federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan offered businesses working capital at an interest rate of 3.75%. There have been complaints EIDL dollars aren't moving to businesses quickly enough, he said.
   
 "We've been hearing a lot of frustration from folks who have not been able to tap these dollars," he said.
   
 A work in progress
   
 Kelly, who has issued two dozen executive orders related to the pandemic since March 16, said she would reveal an economic-transition plan by early May.
   
 She said an outline of action proposed by President Donald Trump, who has spurred interest in protests to pressure governors to flip the switch, included broad testing as a prerequisite.
   
 "One of the things that it says right at the very beginning is that we've gotta have the testing and the contact tracing in place before we can take the second step," she said. "I'm working with state public health officials, our emergency management team and an assortment of other experts to explore how we can tailor this guidance to Kansas."
   
 She said the restart in Kansas could be phased in a way that reflected differences in how severely COVID-19 impacted communities.
   
 Sixty-nine Kansas counties have reported at least one positive test for the virus, but 10 counties account for more than 80% of the 1,849 total. Half of these cases are in Wyandotte, Johnson and Sedgwick counties. COVID-19 has claimed 92 lives in 14 counties, but three-fourths were residents in Johnson or Wyandotte counties.
   
 The full extent of the virus's spread in Kansas is unknown because the state ranks near the bottom nationally in per-capita testing.
   
 "We will be moving back to normal as the science allows," Kelly said.

He solved some of the hardest problems, was a qualified architect and received three patents. On May 18, 1991, he married Juanita Anderson and several years later adopted their beautiful daughter born May 15, 2007. Mike was a devoted father, liked golf, played video games, played board games with his family and loved playing the occasional poker game with his childhood friends. He also loved his dog, Abigail who he found comfort with her when he wasn't feeling well. Mike was a humble man and loved helping friends and family. He was a spiritual man and believed in a higher being. He will be deeply missed by his friends and family and all who knew him. I would like to thank the staff at Wilson CVICU and Albany Medical Center for their exceptional care of Michael. Due to COVID-19, there will no calling hours, just family at the cemetery. A celebration of life will be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers a donation can be made in Michael's name with American Diabetes Association.

Citing an example, the actor elaborates: " If the film ‘Khuda Kay Liye' were about glorifying the Taliban I would have not come on board to be part of the story. Coming from a very orthodox Muslim family, as a child I was told that Islam is the greatest religion and all non-Muslims are 'kaafirs'. But those thoughts used to disturb me as a growing adult. I was like, ‘but my friend KC Singh is such a nice fellow, it was not his decision to born a Hindu, so why would he go to hell?' We do not choose our parents and the religion we are born into'. Why should music be banned? All those questions were addressed in ‘Khuda Kay Liye'. So, as an actor, I had to agree with the ideology that the story was showing, not necessarily the character that I was portraying."
