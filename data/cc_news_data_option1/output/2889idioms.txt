The traditional annual events are important fundraisers for WAEF, in addition to recognizing students and scholarship donors. This year, the foundation has provided a Text to Give option for those that want to support student success. By texting the word “Apple” to the number 56512, those interested in donating to WAEF are taken to a website where contributions can be made and/or the film can be viewed.
 Funds raised through these annual events support student success at college. It is the goal of the foundation that their scholarship recipients not just enroll in college but that they graduate on time and prepared to launch their careers. To that end, throughout the year WAEF hosts career development workshops, provides care packages, organizes campus and regional networking events, and cultivates a supportive student community. These activities happen with the assistance of about 200 volunteers from the tree fruit industry and fruit growing communities.
 The Scholarship Celebration Luncheons are presented by Northwest Farm Credit Services. Additionally, sponsorship support this year came from AgroFresh, Alegria & Company, Allan Brothers, Chelan Fresh, CliftonLarsonAllen, CMI Orchards, Columbia Valley Fruit, Conover Insurance, Cowiche Growers, CPC International Apple Company, Crunch Pak, Gilbert Orchards Inc., Good Fruit Grower, GS Long, Heritage University, Homchick Smith & Associates, HR Spinner Corporation, Kershaw Companies, Key Bank, Legacy Fruit, Matson Fruit, McDougall & Sons, Moss Adams LLP, North Cascades Bank, Northwest Farm Credit Services, Orchard-Rite, PayneWest Insurance, Sage Fruit, T&G Global, Tree Top, USI, Valley Tractor & Equipment, Washington Fruit & Produce, Wells Fargo Commercial Banking, Yakima Pomological Club and Yakima Valley Community Foundation. All sponsors stayed on board with their support of WAEF even though the traditional in-person events were not able to occur.
 The Washington Apple Education Foundation supports more than 300 students annually with scholarship support in excess of $1 million. Funds for the scholarships are raised through annual donations from fruit growers, packers, suppliers and interested community members. For information, visit waef.org or call 663-7713.

She got very upset and told me I was being disrespectful to her by even passing it on to her. I should add that we met online and have been talking on the phone with each other for only a month during this shelter-in-place time.
 This incident nearly ended our new relationship. Was I wrong to send her the video? And what should I do now to save what I think is the most wonderful relationship I have ever had in my life?

S]tudents are likely to return in fall 2020 with approximately 63-68% of the learning gains in reading relative to a typical school year and with 37-50% of the learning gains in math. However, we estimate that losing ground during the COVID-19 school closures would not be universal, with the top third of students potentially making gains in reading. Thus, in preparing for fall 2020, educators will likely need to consider ways to support students who are academically behind and further differentiate instruction.

We are not positive but neutral when it comes to the construction or infrastructure space, said Fund Manager, MOAMC. Let us take stock of the earnings so far. Post Axis Bank’s moratorium confusion, it seems like the Street has absorbed the earnings well. I cannot comment on individual stocks but if we look at the sector, obviously in the last couple of months, there has been a lot of debate as to what the moratorium number is going to be. So if we look at the banks which have come out with their numbers so far, HDFC Bank came out with its numbers wherein it disclosed morat book of only 9%. So that was positively taken by the Street. Now again, Axis Bank has also revealed 9.5-10% morat book number. So again, that is a positive for banking as a space overall. But till now, there is confusion about how different banks are reporting the morat numbers. So there is no consistency in that. Again, if we look at Federal Bank wherein they disclosed morat book of 24%, how they calculated the morat-2 number was; for people who paid the entire amount of money, they removed those from the morat-2 book but in the case of other banks like Axis Bank, that is not the case. People who have not cleared dues in morat-1 still have not been taken into morat-2. So obviously, the number 9-10% on the overall book looks a much better number but at this time, one cannot draw the full conclusion of what the ultimate credit cost is going to be. The only thing we know right now is that the tail risk of the banking space has come down because a couple of months back the credit cost for these banks used to be 1.5-2%. We did not know what the range is going to be for this year; whether it is going to be 5-6-7-8%. So with these numbers, obviously that band has come down wherein the credit cost could be 2.5-3%. Let us see because ultimately it is the 10% customers which will decide what the ultimate credit cost is going to be. The only thing is, we have seen the economy bounce back very sharply. It moved from a 35-40% run rate basis to 80-85% at this time which obviously means that there are companies and individuals who will default much lesser. So from that perspective, things look much better for the banking space overall. It is only when things are bad for the sector that the sector makes money over the next 12 months. Case in point being pharma. One year back people were not looking at pharma as a space but pharma has been the best performing sector over the last 12 months. Similarly, if we look at IT, two years back, IT did very well when valuations were very attractive. Same thing right now is for the financials space overall. A lot of these high quality private sector banks are available at closer to one time price to book. So from that point, I will be very positive on financials as a space over the next 12 months. Also, if we look at Nifty, it is right now at 11,100-11,200. So it is broadly 10% lower than its highs of 12,400. If we break down how has that 10% lower come from, it is entirely on account of financials as a sector because financials as a space is still down 30% from the top with a weightage of over 30% plus. This means it is 9-10% down overall on the Nifty side. So net-net, overall on the valuation side, things are improving on the asset quality side. I would bet money on these larger private sector banks if I have to choose one sector over the next 12 months even though the shorter term narrative will be quite negative and it is the most unloved sector at this hour. So that will be my views on financials as a sector. What about pharma? Pharma is a sector which is well-discovered by the market. Do you think time has come to book profit or would you say pharma is a story which is here to stay for the longer term? Pharma is again a very evergreen sector from that point of view. So there can be tactical underperformance or outperformance as a function of the economic environment. But this sector for a long period of time will continue to be an attractive sector. If we go back slightly into history, over the last 12 months, the pharma index has been up 35%. It has been the best performing sector but prior to that, the last three to five years were pretty bad for the sector. So last year’s performance was a catch up of the underperformance the sector had seen through over the last few years. From that point, one should not extrapolate last year’s performance going ahead from that point. Within the pharma sector, you can break down the sector into two parts -- one is the India-focussed companies and the other is companies which are focussed more in the European market. So the Indian pharma market is a market very similar to a consumption market. It is a Rs 1,15,000 crore market. It is steadily growing at 10-12% on a sustainable basis. Top-most companies over here make 35-40% margins and ROC in this business is 50% upwards. I cannot name companies here but the India pharma market continues to be an attractive space for any long-term investor. Coming to the other part in terms of companies which are more dictated by the US market, obviously in the last three to four years, we have seen the US market become slightly unattractive because of the number of approvals which came through for every molecule. Hence competition increased and the pricing power came down. Also, there was consolidation among the suppliers. So net- net, the supernormal margins which a lot of these US-based pharma companies were making over the last four to five years had come down over the last 18 months. So going ahead, that supernormal profit is not going to come back because the structure of the market has changed but obviously the price erosion has come down to 5-6% which was the case two to three years back. So it will be a case of again a steady revenue base for a lot of these companies. Again, I cannot name companies here but in the US markets, the pharma market will continue to be volatile because you do not know how the pricing power shapes up as more molecules being granted approval will lead to a loss of pricing power from that side. So you need to have a mix of companies which are strong both on the Indian market side and also some companies which are very strong on the US side. Also, a lot of these pharma companies over the last three to five years have seen their cost base go up drastically. The R&D; spending had also gone up. So now a lot of these pharma companies are introspecting whether the US market needs so much of investment and they are trying to cut down in terms of the R&D; spend and also the overhead costs which they had put up to support the growth in the US market which has not come through. So you are seeing margin improve for some of these pharma names. So net-net, pharma continues to be a very attractive sector in the longer term. There will be periods like the last one year where the sector did very well because of previous years’ underperformance and also because of economic investors wanting more defensives in their portfolio. But on a longer term, this sector will continue to give a 15% compounding return over the medium to longer term. What exactly is it that you are pencilling in about L&T; or about the capital goods sector as a whole? I cannot talk on L&T; as a stock. But again, if we look at the sector, when does a capital goods sector do well? It is only when the utilisation levels across companies are running high so that a company is forced to put up a new capex. So the things were anyway bad pre- Covid in terms of capacity utilisation. With Covid, it takes it the entire sector a couple of years behind. So even though capital goods as a sector has done very badly, if you look at the index, it is down 25% on a one-year basis versus Nifty, which is down only 1%. But I would not be very positive on capital goods as a sector overall. But again, if we break up the capital goods sector, there will be companies that are well-positioned and a lot of the infrastructure spent is being done by the state government and the central government. I know the balance sheet of the government is weak but whatever we can the government is prioritising a lot of capex in terms of infrastructure spend, be it roads, irrigation or affordable housing, that is one sector which has a high multiplier in terms of the economy; be it the cement demand, the steel demand or be it in terms of employment among the construction workers. So I think on the construction side or the infrastructure side, I will not exactly be positive but neutral on that space. But we have to look at a lot of these names. It is a consensus this sector will not do well but the valuation of a lot of these names factors in those things. So again, it is going to be a call between being patient in some of these stocks and especially the leaders in the space and holding it for the next few years because we never know when things will look up in the entire space. So I will not be very positive on the sector but in case one has to play a name or two in the sector, probably you can play a leader especially focussed on the infrastructure side rather than the private sector capex side in the sector.

KINGSTON - If not for the cancelation of high school spring sports, the Silver Lake softball team would have likely won its ninth straight Patriot League Keenan Division title in 2020, and 13th of the last 14 years, with its two returning senior all-stars, Ari Sylvester and Bri Belfort, leading the way.
 "They were really poised to compete and to keep Silver Lake where it's always been, which is contending for a league championship and a South Sectional title," Head Coach Tony Pina said. "Those two seniors were really ready to lead us."
 Sylvester, the starting third baseman as a junior, was set to switch to catcher, where she would serve as Belfort's batterymate. "As a junior, Bri kept the train rolling and she was absolutely poised to do that again [on the mound]," Pina said. "With those two seniors and with underclassmen who saw a lot of playing time last season, I definitely expected us to be at the top of the Patriot League, to defend our title successfully and to make some noise in the tournament."
 Four other Lakers also saw their careers end prematurely. All played junior varsity last season and would have been competing for starting jobs this spring in the outfield or infield. They were Mia Dawson and sisters Morgan, Kendall and Jordan Healey. "They're all very versatile and could have played anywhere," Pina said.
 Projected to start at shortstop was junior Lily Gustafson, who played second base last season. Junior Delaney Callanan would have been at first base, with junior Julianna Harvey and sophomore Jaymee Carr in the outfield. Junior Alexis Stadelman would have also been in the mix.
 Pina said it is difficult to project what the 2021 Lakers will look like, but he expects Carr, who was the backup pitcher last season to Belfort, to be in contention for the top spot on the mound along with a few newcomers who have shown promise.
 "I feel confident we will continue to be very strong pitching-wise," he said.
 He said the key to future success will depend on how his players respond to missing an entire season.
 "It really comes down to the work ethic of the individual players and what they do on their own," he said. "I place a lot of trust in our returning players to continue working hard and to seek out opportunities to play softball this summer, because of what this gap due to the pandemic has done is level the playing field."

 The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association on Tuesday announced its long-awaited plans for the upcoming high school sports season. Schools in the Big 9 and Caribou Trail League are heavily impacted because the plan requires counties to move forward in the governor’s reopening plan before games could take place.
 For instance, in order to have a fall season, schools must be in Phase 3 for low-risk sports like cross county and Phase 4 for high-risk sports like volleyball and soccer. Chelan, Douglas and Yakima counties are in Phase 1.5 with high number of COVID-19 cases.

CHICAGO — Amid a surge in gun violence and protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, the nation’s third-largest city is on edge, awaiting possible greater tension in the form of a plan by President Donald Trump to dispatch dozens of federal agents to Chicago.
 The White House plan emerged days after a downtown protest over a statue of Christopher Columbus devolved into a chaotic scene of police swinging batons and demonstrators hurling frozen water bottles, fireworks and other projectiles at officers. Then, on Tuesday in another neighborhood, a spray of bullets from a car passing a gang member’s funeral wounded 15 people and sent dozens running for their lives.
 Tension in the city has climbed to a level that, if not unprecedented, has not been felt in a long time.
 “I’ve never seen things worse in this city than they are right now,” said the Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Roman Catholic priest and longtime activist on the city’s South Side.
