This 1990 musical is loosely based on the 1896 novella of the same name written by Robert Louis Stevenson and features a book written by Leslie Bricusse and music and lyrics written by Frank Wildhorn, Bricusse, and Steve Cuden. It premiered on Broadway in 1997 and starred Robert Cuccioli, Linda Eder, and Christiane Noel. A revival of the show opened on Broadway in the spring of 2013 and closed shortly after. In March 2019, it was announced that Alexander Dinelaris will write the script for the upcoming film adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde, and it will be produced by Lexicon. The show follows talented physician Dr. Jekyll's descent into madness as he creates an alternate evil personality for himself, Dr. Hyde. Throughout the show, one man tries to juggle both polar opposite personas and rid himself of the evil Dr. Hyde. This show features a pop-rock score including songs like "This is the Moment," "Someone Like You," and "In His Eyes." Go listen to the soundtrack on Apple Music or Spotify and watch this gripping tale's film adaptation this Halloween.

NEW YORK — Wall Street rallied Monday as hopes for economic aid from Washington helped it recover all its knee-jerk losses after learning President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus.
 The S&P 500 jumped 60.16 points, or 1.8%, to 3,408.60 amid widespread gains, with nine out of 10 stocks in the index rising. Energy producers and tech companies led the way.
 Treasury yields, stocks overseas and oil all climbed after Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi both noted the importance over the weekend of additional support for the economy. The market's rally accelerated after Trump tweeted in the afternoon that he'll leave the hospital, though his medical team said he "may not entirely be out of the woods yet."
