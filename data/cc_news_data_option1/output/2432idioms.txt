Between them the four mothers fell into rent arrears, defaulted on council tax, incurred bank overdraft charges, borrowed money and even become reliant on food banks to make ends meet.
 One of the mothers had to decline a promotion and put her professional aspirations on ice because of the way the universal credit system treated her earnings.
 Another felt compelled to give up her job to look for alternative employment where there was no clash between her pay date and UC assessment period . __
 Lady Justice Rose said that Danielle: "expresses her doubts whether she will ever be able to get back on top of her finances and worries that cash flow problems will mean she is unable to pay her rent, jeopardising her tenancy."

In 2018, single mother Danielle Johnson, along with three other mothers supported by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), took the DWP to court over a flaw in the universal credit claims period that she argued left her - and other mothers - significantly out of pocket.
 When calculating universal credit, the DWP has set assessment periods for each person to look at how much they earn - from the 1st of the month to the end of the month, for example.
 But lawyers for the mothers said a problem arises when claimants are paid by employers on a date which "clashes" with their assessment period.
 Danielle, a school-dinner lady is paid on the last working day of each month and her benefit assessment period runs from the last day of the month to the penultimate day of the following month.
 This means in some months, due to a weekend being at the end of a month, her wages are deposited in her bank account a day or so earlier than in other months.
 The universal credit computer system interpreted this as Danielle having earned twice as much in one month and none in others, so her universal credit payment would be calculated accordingly. __
 It resulted in extreme fluctuations in her income and, and in several months she lost the work allowance part of the universal credit payment, meaning she was around £500 per year worse off.
 __In 2019, Danielle won her case in the high court of appeal, however in May this year, the DWP appealed it.
 However, today, judges dismissed the Government's appeal.
 They said it was irrational for the DWP's system that accommodates universal credit benefit claimants’ regular monthly pay dates when they are paid early because pay day falls at a weekend or bank holiday. __
 The variation in Danielle’s benefit award caused her severe cash flow problems.

A State-wide agitation has been planned against the recent amendments to the Land Reforms Act, 1961, that paves way for direct purchase of farm land from farmers by non-agriculturists.
 Farmers across the State will hold a series of agitations staring June 23 and will entail gheraoing the district-in-charge Ministers followed by protests in front of the residences of the local MLAs. The agitation plan also includes laying siege to the residence of Chief Minister in Bengaluru on June 29.
 This was stated by the Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar here on Monday. He appealed to farmers belonging to various organisations to join hands and support the agitation and said the amendments to the Land Reforms Act will break the back of the farming community.
 He said the both the Central and the State governments “have become subservient to industrialists and corporate lobby and were enacting laws that were beneficial to them while ignoring the farmers”.
 Questioning the rationale for easing the norms for purchase of agricultural lands by non-agriculturists, Mr. Shanthakumar said by the same logic unqualified persons should also be appointed as doctors and engineers.
 Responding to the remarks of various Ministers that over 2.4 lakh acres of agricultural land had been converted for non-agricultural purpose during the last few decades, he said the onus was on the government to fix responsibility on those who had allowed the conversion. “If the law has been broken then the guilty should be prosecuted but instead they are overthrowing the original Act and paving way for the sale of agricultural land.”
 The Association office-bearers said at a time when the country was reeling under COVID-19 and agricultural activity too had been affected, the government should take measures to strengthen the hands of the vulnerable sections including farmers. But it had passed a series of amendments strengthening the hands of the corporates while weakening the farmers, they opined.

HONG KONG, June 22, 2020 - (ACN Newswire) - While the pandemic has led many to believe remote work will become the norm, concerns about lagging creativity and loneliness demonstrate that there is still a role for the office in a post Covid-19 world, according to The Executive Centre (TEC). While there are advantages to working from home, such as reduced commuting times, costs and pollution, there are also disadvantages for businesses and employees. In a video produced in association with Business Reporter, Paul Salnikow, founder and CEO of TEC, discusses what the future of work could look like.      "Being one of Asia's largest premium flexible workspace operators give us a good insight into how companies have been adapting," he says. "Once our centres reopened, we found our members were looking forward to coming back as they missed the social interaction their office provided." Other disadvantages to remote working include a disruption to creative thinking and the additional logistical steps required to ensure business can continue as usual.      The situation has also made it difficult for companies to accurately predict headcount. "What we're seeing now is a re-evaluation by organisations of their office strategy," Salnikow says. "The current market uncertainty is creating huge demand for the flexible workspace sector as companies try to manage costs and become less willing to commit to long-term leases." Vast resources are wasted paying leases for real estate businesses simply don't need. Flexible working spaces are a vital way of ensuring that no longer happens.      "Every healthy business needs to consider what mix of traditional and flexible is right for its teams and their work," says Senior Development Director of TEC, Todd Liipfert. "Sales teams who need to work both remotely and in different places will benefit from flexible access to broad networks. Creative teams that use the office as a place to spark ideas need more permanent and fixed spaces."      The workspace of the future must be agile and versatile to adapt to unprecedented and unpredictable challenges that are becoming more common in our society. Wherever and however, businesses choose to move forward post Covid-19, there will be a workspace trend where professionals place higher value on their flexibility.

"Tonight let's talk about a few things: Why the coronavirus has spread so rapidly behind bars, the impact that has on absolutely everyone, and what we can and should be doing about it," Oliver said. "And I know that if you are fortunate enough to have little to no familiarity with the prison system, it can be easy to ignore this problem. And that attitude is actually reflected by some in local government." But among other things, he said, because about 445,000 people work at prisons — at least 9,100 of them have contracted COVID-19 — and jails are revolving COVID-19 incubators, "coronavirus doesn't stay behind bars, it travels easily."
