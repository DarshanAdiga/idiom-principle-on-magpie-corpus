I provvedimenti governativi di questi giorni hanno disposto la chiusura delle scuole ma non delle fabbriche e degli uffici; si annunciano tutele per i genitori ma al momento nessun provvedimento e stato messo in pratica». Comincia cosi un dispaccio di fuoco diramato oggi 11mmarzo da Maria Teresa Turetta, responsabile provinciale per il vicentino del sindacato autonomo Cub, la quale prende in esame la situazione nel mondo del lavoro alla luce della emergenza coronavirus. «I datori di lavoro - si legge - sono stati invitati ad imporre le ferie ai propri dipendenti. Le imprese che hanno visto rallentare le attivita procedono con licenziamenti di massa.  È evidente che questo e un governo che non vuole dare fastidio al capitale, scaricando di fatto tutto il peso dei provvedimenti anti coronavirus solo sui lavoratori». Poi c'e un altro passaggio. «Nelle grandi fabbriche la Cub ha proclamato scioperi ad oltranza. Nel pubblico impiego cio non e possibile per i noti accordi di limitazione degli scioperi sottoscritti dai sindacati confederali alla fine degli anni '90\. Tuttavia al sindaco di Vicenza Francesco Rucco chiediamo di farsi portavoce nei confronti del governo per chiedere: chiusura di tutte le fabbriche, di tutti gli uffici, di tutti i servizi, tranne quelli essenziali per i cittadini, salvaguardando stipendi e posti di lavoro. Questa e l'unica prevenzione da fare e serve farla subito perche il diritto alla salute va garantito a tutti».

Wesley Smith, 37, had been released from hospital after taking an overdose but Norwich Magistrates Court heard Smith, who stays with his parents, returned home, angry and 'abusive'. Anna Crayford, prosecuting, said he picked up a knife and stabbed it into the table before making threats to hurt himself. He 'held the knife to his throat' suggesting he was going to hurt himself and was acting like he had 'lost it'. Smith's father was standing just a couple of feet away during the incident which happened on Monday (March 10). When interviewed by police, Smith told officers he had drunk a bottle of vodka and told his parents to go away before picking up a knife. His drinking stemmed from a relationship breakdown three years ago which means, as a result, that he only sees his children some of the time. Smith, of Stanley Close, Cantley, appeared via videolink from Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre (PIC) and admitted criminal damage. He also admitted driving with excess alcohol and no insurance which followed an incident on January 26 this year when he was stopped by police while driving a Jaguar car in Brundall. He was found to have 131 microgrammes in 100 mililitres of breath. The legal limit is 35. John Rutherford, from the probation service, said that Smith, who was represented by Natalie Myers, was a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character largely due to drinking a litre of neat vodka a day. He said Smith's drinking was down to the breakup of his relationship three year ago since when things have gone 'downhill badly' adding he had embarrassed himself and his family but wanted to show his parents he could beat it. Chairman of the bench Jim Agnew said drinking that much a day was 'suicide'. He was given an 18 month community order including alcohol treatment requirement, 20 days rehabilitation activity requirement, 40 hours unpaid work and £80 costs. He was also banned from driving for 36 months.

DUBLIN -- The Irish government will not prioritize a particular part of its economy in its fiscal response to the coronavirus epidemic, the finance minister said on Wednesday after calls from the hospitality sector for help.


  Ireland also recorded its first death from the outbreak on Wednesday, an elderly woman with an underlying illness, national broadcaster RTE reported.


  The confirmed cases of coronavirus in Ireland rose to 34 on Tuesday from 24 a day earlier, the health department said in a daily update.


  Although Ireland is in the early stages of the outbreak, the government has set aside 3 billion euros to deal with the economic fallout, primarily through boosts to sick pay.


  With hotels and restaurants already reporting cancellations, the Restaurants Association of Ireland has called for a temporary cut in sales tax for the sector and a halving of social insurance contributions.


  "In the coming days and weeks…we will feel and will hear many different parts of our economy indicating the acute challenge that they are going to face," Paschal DonohoeDonohoe told a news conference.


  "It wouldn't be appropriate to begin to be prioritizing a particular part of our economy given this will be an economy-wide challenge."


  A 2011 cut in the VAT rate for hotels, restaurants and other tourist businesses to 9% from 13.5% helped lift a sector reeling from Ireland's financial crisis to a boom in recent years that continued past the resoration of the sales tax rate in 2019.


  However the Restaurant Association said its members reported that 80% of their corporate booking had been canceled, and that was before all St. Patrick's Day parades around the country - big draws for tourists each March - were called off this week.


  The National Trasport Authority reported a 5% dip in daily users of public transport as more workers opt to stay at home.


  Jim Edwards', the oldest restaurant in the southern tourist coastal town of Kinsale that Tuesday was the quietest non-weather related day it had experienced in March during 49 years in business.


  Donohoe said the package announced on Monday were designed to support all businesses - in particular 200 million euros in liquidity support for affected firms - but that the government would keep the measures under review and see if there are others they should implement.

In a matter of weeks, coronavirus has spread from China to close to 100 countries worldwide, including the United States. Although the risk in Massachusetts at press time is low, the numbers continue to climb and many people are panicking. In some ways, people are acting like the world is going to end.
 News reports on television, online and in print are feeding public fears with overwhelming coverage and constant use of the words, "deadly," "death toll," "epidemic," "outbreak." It seems like many people think if they get the virus, they will die.
 In this time of a global health crisis, it seems to be every man for himself at pharmacies and supermarkets. The shelves are no longer stocked with little things we use to take for granted, antibacterial gel, soap, wipes and sprays. Every time a new shipment arrives, the stock is depleted within hours.
 People are also hoarding toilet paper and water. Amazon may have these hot commodities but they are being sold at ridiculously inflated prices.
 Is it reasonable to prepare for the worst or better not to panic and wait for instructions of what we should be doing should the crisis get progressively worse?
 Many people are still going about their daily business, but some of our behaviors have drastically changed. Some of us may no longer shake hands when we meet someone. If we hear someone cough, some of us may run in the opposite direction. Some of us may be avoiding Chinese restaurants and in some cases, Chinese people. Some of us may be avoiding large crowds and public transportation or wearing masks even though we are healthy.
 There's no doubt coronavirus is to be taken seriously, especially if you are elderly, immune-suppressed, or have an underlying health condition. Many public institutions such as schools and churches are making changes to prevent further spread of the disease.
 Parishioners who attended Sunday liturgy on March 8 at Taxiarchae Greek Orthodox Church in Watertown were informed about some changes being made to protect them from coronavirus.
 Holy bread is no longer distributed by the priest to parishioners from his bare hands. Instead, individuals have the option to help themselves to the community basket of bread at the end of the service with their bare hands.
 All the prayer books normally stored on the shelves in the pews are now gone. Parishioners are being asked to bring their own books.
 Instead of kissing icons to show respect, parishioners are being asked to bow to the icons.
 There are hand sanitizing stations for parishioners to use on their way into the church. There are signs posted reminding parishioners to stay home if they are sick.
 However, what hasn't changed in the Greek Orthodox Church is the way parishioners receive Communion (a mixture of wine, which represents the blood of Christ, and bread, which represents the body). They will still be given Communion with a common spoon from a common cup shared by everyone.
 Reverend Athanasios Nenes said the procedure for this holy sacrament is not changing because, "the virus does not come from Christ."
 Many parishioners, young and old, proved their faith by lining up to receive holy Communion.
 Have faith, everyone. This too shall pass. We cannot live in a bubble. But we can remember to wash hands more frequently, especially before eating and cooking; and, we need to try not to touch our faces.
 Eventually news of the virus will subside and everyone will finally calm down. Shelves will once again be stocked with antibacterial hand and household cleaners and we should all be able to sleep easier at night. In the meantime, think about re-financing because interest rates are going down.

That open line of communication was used to perfection on Tuesday as the Eagles cruised to a 48-34 victory over Onekama in the nightcap of two regional semifinal games at Traverse City Central. McBain Northern Michigan Christian outlasted North Bay 48-43 in the first game of the evening.


  "It's not just me making decisions, I lean on them in the huddle," Fischer said. "I think that makes them feel more comfortable and more positive and willing to speak up so they can adjust well."


  The Eagles (23-1) took their time finding their way on offense but wasted no time shutting down the Portagers post players Colleen McCarthy and Sophie Wisniski. Bellaire flew to a 10-0 lead before McCarthy finally found some breathing room for two buckets in the final minute of the opening quarter.


  Onekama's zone defense worked well for the first few minutes of the game but once the Eagles had a chance to analyze why they weren't getting shots up, they were off to the races.


  "We adjusted stuff on the fly and it worked out well," Fischer said. "They are so smart. Everyone talks about their talent, which is rightfully deserved, but their basketball IQ is off the charts."


  Bellaire continued to pile on the points in the second, using quick and accurate passes to break the Portagers zone defense and force Onekama into man-to-man in the second half.


  The Eagles held a 21-8 lead at half and extended it to 39-19 before the final quarter.


  "The ball wasnt dropping for us and we weren't executing as well as I would have liked," Portagers head coach Tracy Bennett said. "Once you are in a hole by that much, it's hard to dig back out.


  "They kept punching and they never stopped ... what more can you ask?"


  The Portagers outscored the Eagles 15-9 in the final quarter but the deficit was already too large to overcome — growing to as many as 21 points in the third. McCarthy ended with 11 points while Wisniski had 10.

Q2 GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.57 per share, which included the following significant items. First, we incurred restructuring, acquisition and integration-related expenses of $0.55 per share. Second, as I previewed on our last call, we took a $0.19 per share non-cash pension settlement charge for the lump sum payout program completed in the quarter. You'll recall, this reduced the number of participants and associated assets and liabilities in our single-employer pension plan by approximately 30% and lowered the present value of future PBGC premiums and planned administrative costs by $17 million. And third, we had $0.58 per share in expense for store closures within disc- ops, primarily related to the initial group of Shoppers stores that have been or will be sold or closed. Together with two smaller items, the tax treatment of these items and the GAAP tax rate, these adjustments totaled $0.89 per share, which when added to our GAAP EPS results in adjusted EPS of $0.32 per share. This adjusted EPS figure includes the negative impact of approximately $0.44 per share in after tax expense resulting from the three customer bankruptcies.

With Jack gone it is time for Ralph and Holly to take on El Cuco in its underground lair. After the fast paced gun battle this confrontation does come across as a slight anticlimax. The creature is cunning and has lured the duo into a trap. The unstable cave system means that any loud noises could cause a collapse, firing a gun is a definite issue. So instead we get a battle of words and wits. Holly has many questions which are countered with even more questions by the creature that now almost completely resembles Claude Boulton, and indeed it is Claude who decides to cut all this short and risk everything with a blast of his shotgun.<br

"This book is a rare example of a crime novel all of us here at Murder By The Book agreed was fantastic! It topped many of my staff's Best of 2019, and was my favorite book of last year as well. Clare is a literature teacher at a British school, where she specializes in Gothic fiction, including the story 'The Stranger' by R. M. Holland. When one of Clare's colleagues is found dead — with a line from that particular story left near the body — Clare gets wrapped up in the investigation. Things take an even darker turn when she receives a mysterious message. This book has the perfect blend of compelling voice, suspense, tight plotting, gothic overtones, creepy scenes, and a page- turning story — in other words, something for everyone." —owner McKenna Jordan

All of the bags and totes at the store have a direct nautical theme. The material provides durability and water resistance.


  “All of our product is made from old, recycled sails,” Hoff said.


  Retail store locations serve as collection points, Gori said. Sails are sent to Portland, Maine, where the sails are cleaned and then turned into items for sale.


  Hoff said it takes about 10 people to make a bag from start to finish.


  The company estimates that since it began in 1999, it has collected 8,800 sails — which has kept more than 700 tons of material out of landfills.


  “That’s a pretty good fact,” Hoff said. “We use every single piece of the sail.”


  Gori said the green focus of turning old items into new is one of the cornerstones of the company. The other emphasis is “Maine first, New England second and U.S. third.” The company also strives to be good stewards in the communities where they operate.


  “There’s a definite emphasis on ‘Made in the USA’ and supporting other local businesses,” he said.


  The tote bags run $150-160 for a medium bag and $170-180 for a large. Custom add-ons are also available. Rope handles are hand-spliced.


  The company also makes and sells specialty items like a diaper bag, and a beer tote that holds a six pack on ice with a hole in the bottom for water run-off. There’s also a guestbook tote, which allows event participants to sign an item stitched inside of a bag.


  “That is one of the biggest item for gifts, because they know no one else will have it,” Hoff said.


  Sea Bags offers a Sail Trade Program. Anyone donating a sail receives a free item. It can be a custom bag with a number or logo, or store credit for an existing item, which provides more immediate gratification.


  Hoff said there’s a two- to three-week turnaround for custom items.


  “Anything you can imagine, we can put on a bag now,” she said.


  Gori said the Traverse City Sea Bags store will be open five days a week until the full sales staff is in place. Hoff said at full staff the store will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week, with some extended hours during the peak summer season.

The OECD’s very recently forecast 0.8% growth, may also be optimistic – it is certainly out of kilter with the fall of roughly 20% in the FTSE 100 since January.

“I thought compared to other actual online classes I’ve had before I think it was honestly a better situation because you can still see the teacher and there’s like a chat feature where you can communicate with them,” Lustgarten told BuzzFeed News.


  Instead of adapting, some professors have chosen to cancel classes altogether.


  “For two of my classes, we were just supposed to have presentations this week and they both said that they thought it was too difficult to get everyone on Zoom to,” UW sophomore Selma El-Badawi told BuzzFeed News.


  El-Badawi, a history and political science major, said all four of her classes were canceled after the university announced it was ending in-person instruction Friday through March 20, when its winter quarter ends.


  “I mean on one hand I’m fine with not having to present, but on the other I already kind of made my presentations,” she said. “I just kind of wish I hadn’t spent as much time on that.”


  Shannon Gibson, an associate professor in political science and international relations at the University of Southern California, which is doing a three-day test of online teaching this week, said she was disappointed to hear that some faculty aren’t embracing the opportunity.


  “I think it’s a combination of faculty wanting the academic freedom to teach the way that they want to teach and I think there’s also a level of technological intimidation,” Gibson told BuzzFeed News. “I think some of them are just hoping the test is all there is.”


  She added that regardless of whether USC administrators decide to end in- person teaching on a more long-term basis, “I feel like we’re all sort of one earthquake away from having to do this anyways.”


  “It’s a good opportunity to get on board,” Gibson said.


  Although the University of Iowa has not yet moved to online-only instruction, Juan Pablo Hourcade, an associate professor in computer science at the Iowa City college, began to give students the option of attending his class online two weeks ago, so that he could figure out how to use the software in case he is forced to later.


  “It’s helped me work through a few things with the software that we use with the process and it’s also helped some of the students start to figure out how to do things,” Hourcade told BuzzFeed News.


  He encouraged other faculty to test out the technology now and not wait until they have to use it.


  Universities have made tutorials and training available to faculty to help them make the transition. Educators across the country, including Hourcade and Wong, have also offered their own advice in Twitter threads on how to keep students engaged and other technical tips to set up the best live broadcast.

Nuno has put the Wolves team in lockdown, refusing to attend the scheduled pre-match press conference and he and his players will also swerve after match interviews and fly straight home.
 The virus threat has been amplified by Olympiakos and Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis revealing he has tested positive and is self-isolating.
 Molineux boss Nuno is adamant the game should not be played but insists the safety of those travelling is his No1 priority.
 Nuno said: “We appreciate that even though the match is going to be behind closed doors, we know that there are going to be fans here in Athens and we want them to be safe and try to enjoy the journey.
 “But my main message is to be safe. We appreciate it, and then when we come back, we can be reunited again and celebrate together.”

MANCHESTER - Mayor Joyce Craig delivered a “State of the City” address Wednesday morning that highlighted her first term in office while unveiling several new initiatives, including the formation of a housing task force to address the lack of affordable housing in the Queen City and a new multicultural advisory council.
 “Over the last two years, we rolled up our sleeves, and worked together to move Manchester forward,” read Craig’s prepared remarks. “We’re strengthening our schools to ensure all students have the opportunity to succeed. We’re strengthening our economy to help our businesses thrive. We’re strengthening our community to provide a better future for our residents. The state of our city is strong, and our future is bright.”
 Craig presented the first “State of the City” address of her second term in office Wednesday morning before a sold-out breakfast meeting of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.
 Craig reminded those in attendance Wednesday that she got into public service “because of my passion for education,” saying strong schools are foundation for thriving communities with better jobs, safer neighborhoods, and higher property values.
 Over the past two years, Craig said, officials have put Spanish and French classes back in Manchester middle schools, decreased class sizes in the elementary schools, and launched a course where high school students are building a working airplane.
 “Thanks to many of you in this room, Manchester Proud produced the first-ever, community-based, strategic plan as a roadmap to better engage and meet the needs of our students, to support our educators, and to break down barriers so our district is truly equitable and inclusive,” said Craig. “With the adoption of the Manchester Proud plan, a new school board that’s focused on policy, and a superintendent, Dr. Goldhardt, who’s vision is focused on raising the bar and lowering the barriers for all students — things are coming together.”
 Craig cited “bold goals” school administrators have set for the district, including a 100 percent high school graduation rate, having all students reading at or above grade level by 3rd grade, and increasing enrollment in advanced placement and college enrollment courses by 25 percent for students of color or whose families fall below the poverty line.
 Craig announced a $10,000 donation from Brady Sullivan to ensure students enrolled in AP courses, who may not otherwise have the financial means, can afford to take the AP tests.
 “I believe we're experiencing the most exciting time for public education our city has ever seen,” said Craig. “In the coming years, we’ll continue to design innovative programs and drive new ideas. And I’m confident, under the leadership of Dr. Goldhardt and his team, we’ll soon have a fair and sustainable contract for our educators.”
 Craig said since 2010, energy and sustainability initiatives have reduced Manchester’s CO2 emissions by more than 30 percent. On Wednesday, she announced the Queen City has established a goal of 50 percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030.
 “Through energy-efficiency projects we’re working to keep energy costs down, reduce our city’s carbon footprint, and help to conserve our natural resources,” said Craig.
 Craig announced she is launching a housing task force to examine the affordable housing crisis in the Queen City.
 “Rental costs are at a historic high, while rental vacancy rates are near an all-time low,” said Craig. “Through research, discussions, and community and stakeholder engagement, the task force will provide recommendations that respond to both the assumptions and the realities of affordable housing in Manchester.”
 Citing diversity as one of the city’s greatest strengths, Craig announced the formation of the Mayor’s Multicultural Advisory Council.
 “This council will serve as a link between city government and our community to enhance engagement, strengthen relationships, and ensure all residents feel welcomed, respected and accepted,” said Craig. “Diversity is a critical factor for a thriving, prosperous city, and I look forward to working with this council to ensure that intentional efforts are made to further support all of our city’s residents.”
 The breakfast forum featured a question and answer session between Craig and chamber president Mike Skelton.
 Skelton asked the mayor for any updates regarding the city’s planning efforts regarding the potential impact of COVID-19.
 “We had a briefing last week with all of the department heads to give everyone a briefing from the health department perspective, but also to talk about what we need to do in the event that we all can’t come to work,” said Craig. “So thinking about our individual departments - which I would encourage all of you to do for your businesses as well - identify essential employees, think about what we can do online, and think about communication, which is key in all of this.”
 Craig reiterated there have been no COVID-19 cases identified in Manchester, at least as of early Wednesday.
 “It’s all about common sense right now and doing what you feel comfortable doing, and knowing that the city is hoping for the best while preparing for the worst,” Craig said.
 Skelton also asked the mayor about the issue of crime in the city, specifically domestic violence calls. Statistics released last week by Manchester police show violent crime in Manchester was up 6% in 2019, fueled by jumps in homicides and aggravated assaults. The statistics also show a 6% drop in property crimes — including burglary, theft and auto theft. Because property crime outnumbers violent crime 5-to-1, the overall serious crime rate dropped 4% in 2019.
 Skelton asked Craig what the city is doing to address cases of domestic violence, which he said constitute nearly 25 percent of reports to Manchester police. Craig said that over the last two years city officials have approved the hiring of 15 new police officers, with another 10 coming on board this July, resulting in the largest compliment Manchester police has had.
 “It’s absolutely heartbreaking to hear those numbers,” said Craig. “By increasing the number of police officers on our force, I am confident that we will be able to address these needs and other needs within the community. We have SRO’s (school resource officers) in all of our middle schools and high schools. Our community policing officer should help, but again it’s communication. It’s making sure that individuals know when this is happening and need to feel comfortable calling the police. It’s the relationships that the police have with the community, and increasing the force that I believe will help.”

Hey, Thomas, thanks for the question. With regard to your question on recovery, I would say that it is too early yet to assess the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak. During this period, our priorities are still with our users, merchants and ecosystem partners. So as discussed, we plan to continue subsidizing the SME merchants on our platform, and to focus on improving the user experience. As we noted, we believe the investments today and by standing behind our users will accrue value for the shareholders in the long run. That said, I will note that as we launched at the end of February, a three-day campaign on RMB10 billion subsidy shopping festival on the theme of people returning to work, we have sensed a recovery on consumer demand. So, during the first half-hours of that campaign, we sold over 50,000 iPhones on our platform and 20,000 MAC lipsticks. That give us confidence that the longer-term demand for the industry remains unchanged.

Smith, of Stanley Close, Cantley, appeared via videolink from Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre (PIC) and admitted criminal damage.
 He also admitted driving with excess alcohol and no insurance which followed an incident on January 26 this year when he was stopped by police while driving a Jaguar car in Brundall.
 He was found to have 131 microgrammes in 100 mililitres of breath. The legal limit is 35.
 John Rutherford, from the probation service, said that Smith, who was represented by Natalie Myers, was a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character largely due to drinking a litre of neat vodka a day.
 He said Smith's drinking was down to the breakup of his relationship three year ago since when things have gone 'downhill badly' adding he had embarrassed himself and his family but wanted to show his parents he could beat it.
 Chairman of the bench Jim Agnew said drinking that much a day was 'suicide'.
 He was given an 18 month community order including alcohol treatment requirement, 20 days rehabilitation activity requirement, 40 hours unpaid work and £80 costs.
 He was also banned from driving for 36 months.

Margaret Veszpeller is a businesswoman with an entrepreneurial spirit. Catering “on the side” while her children were young, catering for Marie Callender's in Los Angles, she then opened Mill Street Kitchen nine years ago using the TehachaPie kitchen.
 Margaret “inherited” TehachaPie when its owner decided to move out of the area. She confesses that at that time she “never made a pie before in her life.” Margaret had observed Marie Callender's pie-making operation and learning from TehachaPie’s creator, she made all the pies for one month before Charlie handed the original recipes over to her almost five years ago.
 Margaret jumped from having never made a pie to making hundreds of pies for Apple Fest and 400 pies for her first Thanksgiving after taking over TehachaPie. TehachaPie is a big hit at Apple Fest and Thanksgiving, now averaging 700 pies each.
 All pies are made from scratch using a 1940s pie press. Asked what she loves about pies, Margaret says, “Pies give opportunity for creativity.”

The well-spring of human ingenuity does not skip the boating fraternity. Each year new gadgets, designs, and features drive boaters to trade in, trade up, or just turn their heads and appreciate the coolest new thing. In 2020 local dealers will be promoting toys for riders and dockers.      On the Water   Two sports similar to waterskiing, wakeboarding and wakesurfing, each work best with specific shaped wakes. Boats capable of custom tailoring the wake for each watersport are now available, according to Ryan Moriearty, retail manager at Wake Effects by Big Thunder Marine.   These watersport boats are all lumped under the general heading of "tow boats" meaning they are not only designed to gain the maximum performance advantage for the person riding the wake, but also to provide the safest environment for those in the water behind the boat. This generally means a V-drive instead of an outboard motor or even an inboard/outboard setup. With a V-drive, the propeller is located under the hull, safely away from lines and legs. Having the prop under the hull means steering is accomplished with a rudder instead of an outdrive unit. More responsive rudder steering means the craft's handling characteristics are more like a car than a boat.   Tow boats have very specific spots where ballast can be added to keep the bow higher in relation to the stern creating more wake at the speeds required for wakeboarding or wakesurfing. This ballast movement is accomplished by pumping water from one tank to another to create the specific wake desired and is automated from the control station.   In addition, Ryan points out, brands like MasterCraft tow boats handled by Wake Effects are equipped with plates on the transom to shape the wake to a specific profile custom designed for each rider being towed. MasterCraft's Gen 2 Surf System automates this process with push-button ease and can be changed on the fly without tussle or tools. And to ensure maximum performance, the plate system is specifically designed for each model of MasterCraft boat.   Docking and parking assist, common on larger cruisers, are now available on tow boats, too. Some even include a bow thruster for total joy-stick maneuvering during docking. In addition, cruise control on tow boats allows the captain to focus more on the person in the water and neighboring craft instead of the throttle.   On the electronic side of boating, many of the new model tow boats come with Bluetooth capability to fully integrate the helm station screens with action cameras such as GoPro. Some even have the camera already built into the hull design.   Trista Vossman, of Big Thunder Marine, says one of the coolest comfort features this year is really designed to keep the boater cool through a misting system producing a fine water mist from above for those on board.   Trista also points to the growing use of counter rotating props on many models in order to reduce the effect of torque steer on the boat created by a single prop rotating. New in 2020, Big Thunder offers the Crest tri-toon Continental model equipped with two Suzuki 350 HP outboard motors utilizing twin counter- rotating prop technology.   Chad Neubauer, of Formula Boats, sees more custom colors being offered as the innovators at Formula are pushing the envelope on color choices. In addition, Chad says custom lighting and remote control of convenience features through smart device apps are gaining popularity. In fact, the higher-end Formula boats come with an iPad now for this purpose.   The growing trend to more custom features includes an array of lighting options ranging from custom LED lighting under the tri-toon deck, underwater LED lights, to on-board lighting such as walk-way, cup holder, helm station and mood lighting in a rainbow of color options custom controllable by touch screen.   While a joy to look at and use, it is important to keep in mind that any exterior lighting is illegal while the boat is underway as these beautiful light displays tend to mask the visibility of required navigation lights. Such lights inside the vessel are legal while the boat is moving. All custom lighting options are safe and legal while anchored or docked.   Trevor Gardner, of Premier 54 Boat Sales, the number-one Chaparral dealer world-wide in 2019, points to the new Infinity Power Step on the Chaparral 257, 277, and 297 SSX series boats. Push-button operation deploys a set of steps extending 20 inches below the swim platform.   Also new this year, the Chaparral 280 OSX is designed for rough water. As a hybrid center console, the 280 OSX offers a large open bow, seating, and amenities for a large group of people.   The trend toward center console boats will only continue according to Big Thunder Marine Sales Director Thad Jameson. He explained that as popularity grows, manufacturers are rapidly adapting new and innovative ideas for this boat layout. In what was once the go-to boat for fishermen, equipped with bait stations as well as tackle and rod holders, the center console now sports summer kitchens and luxurious lounge seating. Cabins are also more luxurious, and upholsteries richer. Thad says Chris Craft, Fountain, and Statement have all "raised the bar" on this boat layout because of the rapid growth for this segment of the market.   High-tech innovations continue to grow across other segments of the boating market, including tri-toons. Joy-sticks and rear-facing cameras simplify the difficulties of docking. Touch screens at the helm station not only include GPS plotters but now link to the engine management systems allowing the captain to monitor engine function at the touch of the screen.   Teresa Riley, Marketing and Event Coordinator at MarineMax, says remote monitoring is gaining in popularity. It provides security by notification to a smart device in case of boat movement due to anchor drift or attempted theft. Owners also receive notifications about maintenance issues such as battery condition, bilge pump monitoring, and engine hours tracking. Boat Fix, available at MarineMax, provides (in addition to the above list) mechanical and technical assistance on a live telephone call if needed.   According to Teresa, MarineMax also handles Seakeeper, an anti-roll gyro that can be retro-fitted to almost any boat or ordered as an option on a new boat. Seakeeper is installed on all Azimut yachts sold by MarineMax. Measuring approximately two feet by two feet by two feet and weighing slightly over 400 pounds, the smallest Seakeeper unit is designed for boats from 27 to 35 feet. While not an inexpensive option, the Seakeeper eliminates up to 95 percent of roll, both side-to-side and front-to-back. Any Saturday morning on the lower end of the Lake would demonstrate the advantage to a boater. A busy afternoon coving out will be calmer.   Whether controlled by a cell phone app or a touch screen at the helm, boat decks are virtually awash with technological innovations in boating. It appears most of the new trending innovations in the boating world are electronic in nature.      On the Dock   While amenities abound on the water, life on the dock for both boat and boat owner have some cool stuff trending at the Lake. Safety, convenience, comfort, and fun drive the innovations on docks.   Theresa Fears of Aqua Pest Solutions describes the growing popularity of their chemical-free pest control solution for boat docks. Utilizing a blend of essential oils, this product beats back the spider hoards on Lake without the use of dangerous chemicals.   Shelby Burns at Rough Water Docks says the growing popularity of their custom- built swim-up dock steps prove their value again and again. Giving not only an easier path back on the dock, the steps offer additional seating for those wishing to dip their toes in while sipping a glass of wine and slowly watching the sun set on the Lake. Since a dock sits up high off the water, these steps get you closer allowing you to hang out without having to get all the way into the water -- a great way to enhance the lake-life experience.   According to Angie Schuster at Summerset Boat Lifts, docks and lifts have changed to match the growth of boats on the Lake. When smaller boats are on wider lifts, reaching or stepping to the boat can create a hazard. Summerset installs custom walkways providing ease of access for loading, covering, or maintenance. Walkways can be installed at the rear of the boat to access the motor or drive units. Although not a new concept in 2020, this useful option has seen great growth at the Lake.   When the sun hits the water, and the boats come out to play in 2020, there will be plenty of new ideas and new gadgets causing boaters to say, "I gotta get me one of those!"

Addie Nagel leads Charlevoix in blowout win


  CHEBOYGAN — Addie Nagel wasted no time letting Oscoda know who was moving on in the Division 3 regional semifinal at Cheboygan on Tuesday.


  Nagel scored the first seven points of the game for Charlevoix, jolting the Rayders to a huge early lead and helping them coast to a 65-29 victory over the Owls.


  Oscoda (20-4) entered the game on a 14-game winning streak but Nagel’s 20 first-half points were too much for them to overcome. The Rayders held a 43-18 halftime lead and were able to hold the Owls to only nine second-half points with their second string in.


  Nagel finished with 22 points while Elise Stuck added 18 on four 3-pointers. Abby Cunningham snagged eight rebounds and scored eight points and Taylor Petrosky had seven points, five assists and three blocks for Charlevoix (19-5).


  Charlevoix will move on to face Ishpeming Westwood at Sault Ste. Marie on Thursday at 7 p.m. Ishpeming Westwood was responsible for defeating Charlevoix in this same spot in 2019 and the Rayders have not forgotten.


  “That is the team that beat us last year in the regional final,” Charlevoix head coach Marc Sroufe said. “We didn’t shoot well in that game and everybody in Charlevoix thinks we could have won.”


  “Everyone is keen on beating them in the regional final.”

While some faculty have already adopted online teaching, other instructors are having difficulty making the jump, especially on such short notice.


  Benjamin Golden decided to record the audio for her lecture on Zoom, the video conferencing service, and upload it to the school’s online course management system Monday night for students to access on their own rather than hold a live, remote lecture at their regularly scheduled class time.


  She said it didn’t seem “feasible” to hold a live class with her 37 students on Zoom.


  “I know that's possible, but I'm not sure how,” she said.


  Educators who have tested out online classes or who have been teaching remotely for years have found that instructors have to change the way they teach their classes.


  “Certain pedagogies that might work really well in your face-to-face classroom you’re going to have to adapt for an online environment,” said Melissa Wong, an adjunct lecturer in information sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.


  Wong, who has been teaching online courses for nearly two decades and currently teaches all of her courses from her home in California, said she has found that breaking up the class into 10- to 15-minute chunks where she goes back and forth between lecturing and facilitating a class discussion helps keep students engaged.


  “You can do amazingly great stuff, but you have to spend a little time figuring that all out,” she said. “It's going to be a learning curve, but it's also a great chance to model to our students that we can learn new technologies [and] we can take on new challenges.”


  Online conferencing services like Zoom or Blackboard, allow participants to “raise hands,” share screens, message the host and other attendees, and break off into smaller discussion groups. Instructors have found that with smaller classes it’s relatively easy to have students ask questions verbally, but it’s important for everyone to use headsets or headphones in that situation to avoid feedback and echos.


  Maya Lustgarten, a senior at the University of Washington, said it was a bit harder to interact with her Korean language teacher through Zoom on Monday, but the experience overall was good considering the circumstances.

The rise in value happened during a career transition when I wasn't making any new contributions. The increase was 100% market gains. I had bought low by continuing to purchase shares during the recession. As the stock market bounced back, my shares grew in value.

 ## The genius of a balanced investment strategy
 If it was up to me, I would evaluate the funds in my investment accounts by their recent performance and trade the poor-performing ones for the funds with faster growth. In fact, a couple of years ago, I started to do this. When I mentioned this to my financial planner, she told me to cut it out in no uncertain terms. Now I see why.
 My investment accounts are held in a mix of stock funds and bond funds. My financial planner chose the funds and amounts to invest in each to balance my risk. This balanced investment strategy has given me more protection from market volatility than I expected. I had looked at my accounts right before the crash but was too scared to look again until today. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw, thanks to those balanced investments.
 While the markets have seen massive losses since the beginning of the year -- the Dow Jones, for example, lost about 8% in one day this week -- my balanced investment accounts have gone down by about 2%. Some bond fund holdings have actually increased in value.
 My retirement savings are held in more aggressive investment funds, since retirement is quite a few years away for me. When I started writing this article, that account had lost less than 4% of its value. Since then, the account page updated to include today's trading (March 9, 2020), which involved the markets falling off the edge of a cliff. My year-to-date losses more than doubled in a day, to 8.58%. Still, that additional 4.5% is better than the markets, which dropped 7.6%, a day now dubbed "Black Monday."
 Even after Black Monday, though, I refuse to worry. In fact, I think it's time to buy.

The mother said that on the day her teenage daughter was caught shoplifting in Broadmead and she received a phone call from the store's security team.
 It was after this conversation she asked the ward staff for a cigarette and lighter, before walking out of the doors.
 Instead of having the cigarette, the mum claims she waited for about a couple of minutes and then got into a taxi.
 The woman - who was diagnosed with a serious mental health condition as a teenager - says she went to the store to pay for what her daughter had stolen before taking her to McDonald's for a sit down chat about what had happened.
 It was at this point she rang the hospital and told them she would be back by 9pm.
 "I left the hospital at about 4pm and rang them at about 6pm," she continued. "They had the police out looking for me, but I should never have been allowed to walk out of the wards in the first place because of my mental state."
