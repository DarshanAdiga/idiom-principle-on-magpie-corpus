Maybe McCaskill was just bitter because all the fawning coverage she received from the establishment media leading up to the election could not put her over the top. The day before the 2018 election, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski said that she was "obsessed" with the then-senator, according to News Busters.

Gipson attributes his success partly to hardworking parents -- a father who was a truck driver and a mother who was a domestic worker -- who did not spare him from discipline. They taught him to respect others, and neighbors also looked out for him and told his parents when he was out of line.

If all you saw were the highlights of how Collin Morikawa beat back the biggest names in golf and walked off with the PGA Championship, you’d conclude he did it the old-fashioned way.
 The 23-year-old Californian delivered a 6-under 64 in the final round, including a signature shot that fans will be talking about for decades. He hit more fairways and greens, and picked up more strokes with the putter over four days than anyone else in the field. He even arrived at TPC Harding Park with some built-in advantages, in top form after winning twice on tour during this re-jiggered season, and he knew the course well from his days playing college golf at nearby Cal-Berkeley.
 He parlayed all that into a two-shot victory Sunday over third-round leader Dustin Johnson and Paul Casey. Two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka talked a good game, but crashed in his effort to three-peat with an uncharacteristic closing 74. After a turn-back-the-page opening round, Tiger Woods finished tied for 37th, feeling all of his 44 years and heading home before the fireworks on the back nine exploded.
 What Morikawa said afterward sounded familiar, too. Asked whether he expected to win his first major this soon, he looked puzzled for the first time all day.
 “Of course,” he began. “Why not? If you believe in yourself — and I believe I can do it —why not have it as one of my goals?
 “It’s crazy,” Morikawa added a moment later, “because it feels like this is where I’m supposed to be.”

_Grace Kelly_ , _Love Today_ ,  _Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)_... weinig artiesten regen de successen zo aan elkaar als de Brits-Libanese zanger Mika (36) in 2007. Zijn grootste hit in Nederland,  _Relax (Take It Easy)_ , was dat jaar zelfs de bestverkochte single van een buitenlandse artiest. Dankzij fan Paul de Leeuw kwam hij hier daarna nog wel op tv, maar hits bleven uit.

A government commission that studied the cause of the rebellion called for better police-community relations and more low-income housing, along with better schools, more job training, more efficient public transportation and better health care. While some gains have been made, those who live here say the area has a long way to go to overcome decades of neglect.

If his rookie season is done, here are the final numbers: 22.5 points and 6.3 rebounds per game on 58% shooting, albeit in only 24 games. There are many rookies over the years who averaged more points and grabbed more rebounds, but none of them scored as much, rebounded as often and shot as well — the big difference — as Williamson this season.
 Williamson was asked Sunday what he learned from a year that included injury, frustration, a pandemic and racial strife.
 He took several seconds before answering.
 “Just live life, moment by moment,” Williamson said. “Learn from each moment, learn from each experience and just take those lessons and apply it to your life.”
 It was not an unsuccessful season, at least not by all measures. Williamson is a rookie of the year finalist along with heavily favored Ja Morant of Memphis and Kendrick Nunn of Miami, though isn't expected to win the award simply because he didn't play in many games.
 “Zion, he would have won the award, the numbers he's putting up, if he played the whole season," Turner Sports analyst Kenny Smith said Saturday when the award finalists, including rookie of the year, were revealed.
 Williamson will now have at least a couple months off -- the earliest next season is expected to start is December -- to get healthier and continue working on his body. He seemed to be laboring at times Sunday, and the long wrap on his right leg doesn’t exactly suggest everything is well.

After the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis in May, a media narrative about following mask and social distancing mandates to the letter was suddenly replaced to a large degree by support for demonstrations from much of the establishment media and from Democratic lawmakers.
