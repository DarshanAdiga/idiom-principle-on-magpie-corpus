Gia, Pjanic ha metabolizzato tutto durante il lockdown e sogna di salutare la Juventus, dove si trova tuttora benissimo, con la doppietta scudetto- Champions. Il 30enne ex romanista si sta dimostrando abile e professionale nel gestire presente e futuro. In un certo qual modo e un'esperienza che ha gia vissuto nel 2016, quando ha disputato gli ultimi mesi con la Roma ben consapevole del fatto che in estate sarebbe diventato juventino. Per Arthur, invece, e tutto nuovo. E in particolare la sua separazione dal Barcellona non e stata serena come quella di Pjanic con il mondo bianconero. Tanto che il brasiliano, adesso che ha testato la Juventus di persona, non vorrebbe aspettare la fine di agosto. Avesse potuto, si sarebbe fermato a Torino gia ieri e in giornata si sarebbe presentato alla Continassa agli ordini di Maurizio Sarri. Del resto Arthur e anche il primo colpo "sarriano" e segna l'inizio dell'opera di abbassamento dell'eta media (il blaugrana ha 6 anni in meno di Pjanic) e del monte ingaggi della rosa juventina.
