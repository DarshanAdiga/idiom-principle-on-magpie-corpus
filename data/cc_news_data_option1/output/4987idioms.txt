With the Xbox Series X/S console working with past headsets, you may already have everything you need—but for anyone looking, the Razer Kaira Pro is a fantastic and easy-to-use offering. With the ability to pair at the press of a button, and matching the sleek black and green aesthetic of the Xbox Series X/S; the Razer Kaira Pro is that new headset you did not know you needed. The Razer Kaira Pro sounds fantastic: providing rich, clear sound in all types of makes and media. The headset will last for 20 hours on a single charge, is comfortable to wear, even during long gaming sessions; and is Bluetooth-ready allowing for use with your PC or mobile phone with the flick of a switch. And for anyone only interested in audio, the microphone can be removed anytime it is not in use. For people who don’t need all the bells and whistles, the Razer also offers the Kaira that lacks the removable microphone and Bluetooth if you can live without these features, or want to save some money.

The city has recorded the lowest number of dengue cases and deaths in the last five years. Dengue cases year have dropped by 86.3% in Mumbai this year compared to 2015. The death rate has also dropped, with only two deaths from dengue reported this year so far. According to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 873 dengue cases were reported between January and November 2015, which increased to 1,130 during the same period in 2016. In 2017, Mumbai witnessed a slight drop in cases when the number fell to 1,102 in the those eleven months. In 2018 and 2019, the caseload further dropped to 884 and 881 respectively. This year, the city has recorded the lowest caseload -- 119 -- for the corresponding period. Civic officials said the fall in numbers is due to preventive measures taken during the pandemic. "Since the starting of the pandemic in March, we initiated disinfection work in public places. On a larger scale, we carried our sanitation and fumigation work. We also oiled the stagnant water to destroy breeding grounds of mosquitoes," said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. According to data procured from the insecticide department, compared to last year, more breeding grounds of aedes mosquitoes, which spread dengue, were destroyed this year. While 51,509 breeding grounds were destroyed in 2019, BMC increased its tally to 62,872 this year. The most breeding grounds were found in E (Byculla) and G/South (Elphinstone) wards. A senior officer from the insecticide department said, "Our whole department was given the responsibility of disinfection and sanitisation in societies with infected patients. Despite working round the clock, we paid equal attention to take precautionary measures for mosquito-borne diseases, which helped to control the [number of] cases." Another reason for lower numbers may be the restricted movement due to lockdown. Dr Manjusha Agarwal, general physician at Global Hospital, Parel said, "During this ongoing pandemic, people have tried to maintain a clean environment and focus on improved sanitation. Also as people are spending less time outdoors due to the restrictions imposed in the lockdown, it could have resulted in fewer dengue cases."Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist from Khar said, the pandemic had helped to diagnose patients early, which in turn may have prevented fatalities. "As the symptoms of dengue are similar to Covid-19, many dengue patients were diagnosed early at fever camps. This helped to provide treatment without delay," said Dr Srivastava. Despite the improved figures for dengue, doctors advised that the authorities should not let down their guard. "On a regular basis, the civic body should keep removing the scrap materials and tyres which turn into breeding grounds," said Dr Srivastava.

Reputation matters. It's why China is so incensed that Australia has had the temerity to criticize it. Why do we trust Canberra more than Beijing? Because the Australians are free and accountable. They've admitted their war crimes and agonized over them. The Chinese have never acknowledged their far more massive human toll. Even without going back to the Great Leap Forward — the most devastating catastrophe in China's history, causing between 18 million and 45 million starvation deaths — we have the Tiananmen massacre within living memory, the rape of Tibet, and, of course, the widespread infanticide accompanying the One Child policy.

As of May 2020, countries worldwide are taking no chances with COVID-19 and have unveiled stimulus packages worth billions of dollars to salvage their battered economies. While it may seem that the PET Preform Equipment industry will be irreparably damaged, all is not yet doom and gloom. Major companies in the PET Preform Equipment market may decide to adopt a wait and wait approach. In conclusion, the PET Preform Equipment market is ever changing at the moment, but the long-term prospects are likely to be bright. Organizations are advised to view the current global scenario as an opportunity and not a crisis to push the necessary changes to secure their long-term prosperity. Companies that fail to do so would only have themselves to blame if they fall behind their nimbler rivals more attuned to the direction in which the COVID-19 winds are blowing.

“With all the challenges America has right now, (Republicans) think COVID relief should be on the floor, but instead, the Democrats put cats and cannabis” on the House floor, said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. “They’re picking weed over the workers. They’re picking marijuana over the much-needed money we need to go forward″ to address the pandemic.
 McCarthy’s comment about cats referred to a separate bill approved by the House to ban private ownership of big cats such as lions and tigers, a measure boosted by the Netflix series “Tiger King.″ That bill, approved by the House on Thursday, would allow most private zoos to keep their tigers and other species but would prohibit most public contact with the animals.
 Democrats said they can work on COVID-19 relief and marijuana reform at the same time and noted that the House passed a major pandemic relief bill in May that has languished in the Senate.
 The vote comes at a time when most Americans live in states where marijuana is legal in some form, and lawmakers from both parties agreed that national cannabis policy has lagged woefully behind changes at the state level. That divide has created a host of problems — loans and other banking services, for example, are hard to get for many marijuana companies because pot remains illegal at the federal level.
 Four states, including New Jersey and Arizona, passed referendums allowing recreational cannabis. Voters made Oregon the first state in the nation to decriminalize possession of small amounts of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine.
 Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., called the House bill an important racial justice measure. Lee, who is Black, said the bill is the product of years of work by a range of advocates and is long overdue.
 The bill “is a major step, mind you, a major step toward ending the unjust war on drugs and racial inequities that are central to these laws,″ Lee said.
 The bill also would open up more opportunities for marijuana businesses, including access to Small Business Administration loans to help ensure that minorities can take part in an industry dominated by white famers and growers. “This is a job-creating industry, and (the bill) also provides economic opportunities for minority-owned business owners,” Lee said.

The bill, which passed 228-164, now goes to the Republican-controlled Senate, where it is unlikely to advance. A related bill that would give pot businesses access to traditional banking services has languished in the Senate after being approved by the House last year.                     Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, said GOP lawmakers have been pushing for weeks to bring up a bill that allows small businesses to receive another round of Paycheck Protection Program loans. Many small businesses are struggling or have closed as a result of the pandemic.                     If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brought the GOP bill to the House floor, "it would get over 400 votes,″ Scalise told Fox News. "And yet, she's actually focused more on legalizing pot this week than on helping those small businesses with PPP loans. It's just unbelievable how tone deaf (Democrats) are to these small businesses and the jobs, the families that are tied to them."                     Among its provisions, the legislation would authorize a 5% sales tax on marijuana products to fund programs aimed at assisting people and communities harmed in the so-called war on drugs, such as job training and legal aid. It also would require federal courts to expunge prior marijuana convictions.                     The Big Cat Public Safety Act also is unlikely to move forward in the Senate.                     Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, criticized Democrats, saying in a tweet that they are moving to "Prosecute Tiger King" rather than address issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"None of these important goals are partisan in any way, and we hope the Senate will follow suit quickly to make it into law,″ said Baskin, CEO and founder of Florida-based Big Cat Rescue.

NAGPURThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered a setback in elections to six seats of the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC). The ruling three-party coalition, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) won four seats, while the BJP won one. An independent candidate is leading in the sixth seat and is likely to win. To make it worse for the BJP, it lost Nagpur graduates' constituency which was its stronghold for decades. The constituency was represented by Union minister Nitin Gadkari as well as former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' father, late Gangadharrao Fadnavis. Congress' Abhijit Wanjari won the seat comfortably by defeating Sandeep Joshi, former Nagpur mayor and a close aide of Fadnavis for whom it was a prestigious election. Three graduates' constituencies from Aurangabad, Nagpur and Pune (in which graduates who had enrolled themselves as voters for these elections voted), two teachers' constituencies from Pune and Amravati (in which teachers enrolled as voters) and local bodies constituency in Dhule-Nandurbar (which has elected representatives in local government bodies voted) went to polls on November 1. Out of six seats, four are bagged by the MVA. An independent candidate, Kiran Sarnaik, is leading in Amravati teachers' constituency. The result in the constituency is not announced yet. Of these seats, Nagpur and Pune seats were considered a stronghold of the BJP. The defeat in Nagpur, the hometown of both Fadnavis and Gadkari, is considered significant for the party. All the pre-poll arithmetic, organisational strength, meticulous campaign and the party's stronghold did not help BJP candidate Sandip Joshi as he lost to Abhijit Wanjari (Congress) by 18,910 votes. This is for the first time a candidate from BJP or its previous avatar, Jansangh, is defeated in this constituency since its inception. A sizable section within the BJP, on conditions of anonymity, pointed out that Nitin Gadkari group didn't work whole-heartedly for Joshi, as the sitting legislator from the constituency, Anil Sole, a protege of Gadkari, was replaced by Sandip Joshi at the eleventh hour. Joshi had worked as chief election co-ordinator for Fadnavis in his Assembly elections from Nagpur south-west assembly constituency and the former chief minister made it a prestige issue to get Joshi the ticket and his victory. However, neither Fadnavis nor Joshi succeeded to convince the rank and file the reasons for the denial of ticket to Sole, an ex-college teacher. Moreover, Sole, who knows the constituency well as a sitting MLC and being a campaigner for Gadkari when he represented the region, was not visible during the campaign. He was even not entrusted any election responsibility during the campaign. Besides, Wanjari of Congress also managed to polarise the OBC voters against Joshi, a Brahmin candidate.Both Fadnavis and Gadkari were camping in Nagpur for a week to campaign for Joshi. Sole, however, said that the defeat of the BJP candidate was shocking for them. "Late announcement of the candidate may be one of the reasons. Anyway, we will certainly analyse the reasons and consolidate our base in the constituency in next elections," he said. Nagpur city BJP chief and party legislator, Pravin Datke said that they could not guess the undercurrent among the voters this time. "The Congress candidate succeeded to polarise the OBC votes against us and it led to the defeat," he added. The defeats of Pune and Nagpur Graduate Constituencies were an outburst of rank and file of the BJP against the two top BJP leaders of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis and the state BJP chief Chandrakantdada Patil, who have marginalised party leaders, like union minister Nitin Gadkari, Eknath Khadse, Vinod Tawde and Sudhir Mungantiwar said Dilip Deodhar, along-time RSS observer, based in Nagpur. The former editor of Tarun Bharat, the mouthpiece of RSS, Vinod Deshmukh, felt that the entire election was polarised on caste- basis. "In Nagpur, the election was virtually Joshi versus OBC," he pointed out and claimed that even some Congress leaders, including a cabinet minister, openly said during the election campaign that why people should vote for Joshi, a Brahmin, and appealed to vote for Wanjani, an OBC. Moreover, delay in announcing the candidate by the BJP was another reason for the defeat of Joshi, who could not cover all the six districts in a short period of 20 days. On the other hand, the Congress had given a node for the candidature of Wanjari two years ago, Deshmukh further pointed out.In 2014 elections, Sole of BJP had defeated Baban Taywade of Congress with a margin of 31,259 votes. From 1988 to 2014, the constituency was represented by BJP's Nitin Gadkari, who later won the Lok Sabha polls from Nagpur, to become Union Transport Minister in the Narendra Modi-led NDA Government at the Centre. Gadkari had emerged victorious from Graduates' constituency for five times in a row. Before Gadkari, Gangadharrao Fadnavis, father of Devendra Fadnavis was elected from the constituency as Jansangh initially and later as BJP nominee. Following the death of sitting member Gangadharrao Fadnavis, the vacancy was caused and Gadkari was elected in 1988. Both Pune seats were bagged by NCP (Arun Lad in graduates' constituency) and Congress (Jayant Asgaonkar in teachers' constituency) defeating BJP candidates on their turf.NCP's Satish Chavan won from the Aurangabad graduate constituency for the third time in a row. He defeated BJP's Shirish Boralkar.The lone seat the BJP won was Dhule-Nandurbar local bodies constituency. Party candidate Amrish Patel defeated Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi's Abhijit Patil by 234 votes. Patel polled 332 votes, while Patil got 98 votes. Congress leaders expressed surprise over defeat as MVA has 213 members in local bodies, while BJP's strength is 199. Patel had changed sides to join BJP by quitting Congress ahead of Assembly polls last year.In Amravati teachers 'constituency, independent candidate Kiran Sarnaik of Washim was ahead of his nearest rivals Shrikant Deshpande of Shiv Sena with a comfortable majority.Thursday results are seen as a significant victory for the ruling MVA which has announced to contest all the elections including that to the local bodies together in the future.Ruling party leaders said it is a token of the acceptance of the leadership of MVA. "BJP has been decimated in 24 districts in the state during the council elections which were fought directly from the people. This is 'Maharashtra Express' of MVA," said former chief minister, public works department minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan."The results are not as per our expectations as we were expecting more seats to win. We miscalculated the combined power of the three ruling parties under MVA," said the leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi's (MVA) candidate Arun Lad's victory in the elections to the Pune graduate constituency on Friday has brought much confidence to the MVA camp - leaders and workers - and has forced the BJP on the backfoot.Chandrakant Patil, BJP Mumbai's unit president, who earlier represented this constituency, said, "Three parties come together and contested against a single party. Shiv Sena is helping the Congress and NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) but is getting nothing in return. Sena must think about it."NCP leader Ajit Pawar said, "The victory of Arun Lad is the answer to the Opposition party leaders making allegations. Now it is proved that graduate voters also support the MVA."Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, "We failed to estimate the power of the three parties unitedly." BJP's member of Parliament (MP) Girish Bapat accepted the defeat of the BJP candidate and said, "We must do an analysis."NCP leader Sharad Pawar said, "The results show that the citizens are expressing confidence in the MVA. The climate is changing in the state."

As of May 2020, countries worldwide are taking no chances with COVID-19 and have unveiled stimulus packages worth billions of dollars to salvage their battered economies. While it may seem that the 5G Base Station Unit industry will be irreparably damaged, all is not yet doom and gloom. Major companies in the 5G Base Station Unit market may decide to adopt a wait and wait approach. In conclusion, the 5G Base Station Unit market is ever changing at the moment, but the long-term prospects are likely to be bright. Organizations are advised to view the current global scenario as an opportunity and not a crisis to push the necessary changes to secure their long-term prosperity. Companies that fail to do so would only have themselves to blame if they fall behind their nimbler rivals more attuned to the direction in which the COVID-19 winds are blowing.

Pelosi said a bipartisan, middle-of-the-road plan being finalized by a diverse gaggle of senators that she has endorsed as a foundation for the relief bill is a good effort, even though it’s a significant retreat from where Democrats stood before the election.
 “It’s a good product,” Pelosi said. “It’s not everything we want.” Pelosi had dismissed an even larger package floated by moderates in September as inadequate, but said that the looming arrival of vaccines and President-elect Joe Biden’s victory are a “game changer” that should guarantee more aid next year and the elimination of the pandemic. She called the bill a bridge “until the inauguration and the emergence of the vaccine.”

(CNN) – Two U.S. pharmacy chains are preparing to give out COVID vaccines as soon as there’s a green light from the Food and Drug Administration.Health care workers and long-term care facility residents will be the first to get the vaccinations from CVS and Walgreens.“Our plan is to be ready to go as early as Dec. 15, waiting for the state approvals,” said Dr. Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer at CVS Health.In October, the Trump administration announced agreements with CVS and Walgreens to vaccinate residents of long-term care facilities nationwide.The pharmacy chains already have a list of those organizations.“We’ve basically got 31,000 locations where we’re going to have to be doing the vaccination and that’s about 2 million patients,” according to Brennan. “We’ll know who it is; where they are and how many patients there are.”CVS plans to send teams to each of the facilities three times in the coming months. An average team will consist of two vaccinators and one support staffer.Brennan said they’re already working out details for vaccine distribution within each state.“Once we get into sort of general distribution, I suspect that not only ourselves and Walgreens, but there’s going to be a number of other pharmacy chains and grocers who will be involved in it,” he said.“I think that using all those various outlets, we’re going to have very good penetration across the United States.”Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.

Cutajar said that while he’s pleased to see these problems he's been flagging for years finally get addressed, Xemxija Hill should be rebuilt from scratch.

The city has recorded the lowest number of dengue cases and deaths in the last five years. Dengue cases year have dropped by 86.3% in Mumbai this year compared to 2015. The death rate has also dropped, with only two deaths from dengue reported this year so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     According to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 873 dengue cases were reported between January and November 2015, which increased to 1,130 during the same period in 2016. In 2017, Mumbai witnessed a slight drop in cases when the number fell to 1,102 in the those eleven months. In 2018 and 2019, the caseload further dropped to 884 and 881 respectively. This year, the city has recorded the lowest caseload -- 119 -- for the corresponding period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Civic officials said the fall in numbers is due to preventive measures taken during the pandemic. "Since the starting of the pandemic in March, we initiated disinfection work in public places. On a larger scale, we carried our sanitation and fumigation work. We also oiled the stagnant water to destroy breeding grounds of mosquitoes," said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     According to data procured from the insecticide department, compared to last year, more breeding grounds of aedes mosquitoes, which spread dengue, were destroyed this year. While 51,509 breeding grounds were destroyed in 2019, BMC increased its tally to 62,872 this year. The most breeding grounds were found in E (Byculla) and G/South (Elphinstone) wards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A senior officer from the insecticide department said, "Our whole department was given the responsibility of disinfection and sanitisation in societies with infected patients. Despite working round the clock, we paid equal attention to take precautionary measures for mosquito-borne diseases, which helped to control the [number of] cases."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Another reason for lower numbers may be the restricted movement due to lockdown. Dr Manjusha Agarwal, general physician at Global Hospital, Parel said, "During this ongoing pandemic, people have tried to maintain a clean environment and focus on improved sanitation. Also as people are spending less time outdoors due to the restrictions imposed in the lockdown, it could have resulted in fewer dengue cases."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist from Khar said, the pandemic had helped to diagnose patients early, which in turn may have prevented fatalities. "As the symptoms of dengue are similar to Covid-19, many dengue patients were diagnosed early at fever camps. This helped to provide treatment without delay," said Dr Srivastava.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Despite the improved figures for dengue, doctors advised that the authorities should not let down their guard. "On a regular basis, the civic body should keep removing the scrap materials and tyres which turn into breeding grounds," said Dr Srivastava.

Just days after her passing, family, friends and members of the community attended Domer's initial court appearance seeking justice for her death — showing how much she impacted her community.          Staubs, a 1950 Martinsburg High graduate, was described as having a passion for the military — having worked for the Army Air Force Exchange Service in the USA and abroad — and was active in her Christian faith.          If the case were to have proceeded to trial, the state said it could prove that at approximately 9:18 a.m. Sept. 2, police were dispatched to a theft of a gray Chevrolet passenger car at a residence on State Circle in Martinsburg. Police were also advised of a head injury; however, once on scene, Staubs had already been transported to Berkeley Medical Center for her injuries.          Witnesses told police that they observed Domer getting into the victim's car, backing away and the car door striking the victim. He then sped toward Hack Wilson Way.          Officer Lehman with the Martinsburg City Police located the victim's vehicle at a Faulkner Avenue residence, where Domer was said to be found hiding in a closet. Officials said Domer was located with the victim's identification card and credit cards.          Since these events, Domer has been housed in the medical unit at the Eastern Regional Jail without bond. Shortly after his arrest, he became paralyzed due to an abscess on his spine that became infected. No reports of the cause of the abscess have been released.

His research on reprogramming old mice’ epigenetic information to restore vision and show its effect on reversal of ageing was on the cover of Thursday’s edition of Nature, a renowned peer-reviewed scientific journal.

HINESVILLE, Ga. (WTOC) - A statewide task force is watching the roads in Hinesville to help remind you to focus.Spend just a few minutes at Highway 84 and General Screven Way and you’ll see people holding their phones while driving or not wearing seatbelts or showing signs of possible impaired driving. This task force hopes they can put a dent in that this weekend.The yellow vests were hard to miss, but so were the blue lights. Officers stood at the corner and spotted people breaking the law and radioed police or troopers to deliver the ticket. Members of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety brought their Rolling Thunder task force to Hinesville Thursday.They say because of the high number of people hurt and even killed in wrecks here so far this year, and not just at night.“In the daytime, traffic’s heavier. So, people need to pay more attention. It’s all about trying to get them to put on that seat belt and put down the cell phone,” said Roger Hayes, with the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety.On Thursday, they wrote 110 seat belt citations and 38 for distracted driving.“We can see these violations. The texting and driving, distracted driving. We’re always on the lookout for that. During the daytime, but also at night. And DUI same thing,” Georgia State Patrol Task Force Sgt. Dustin Stone said.Both say they deal with DUI’s even in the middle of the day - often from prescription pills and other drugs. They plan to monitor spots like this through Saturday night. They hope people spot them, and change the behavior, before they spot them.Copyright 2020 WTOC. All rights reserved.

The city has recorded the lowest number of dengue cases and deaths in the last five years. Dengue cases year have dropped by 86.3% in Mumbai this year compared to 2015. The death rate has also dropped, with only two deaths from dengue reported this year so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     According to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 873 dengue cases were reported between January and November 2015, which increased to 1,130 during the same period in 2016. In 2017, Mumbai witnessed a slight drop in cases when the number fell to 1,102 in the those eleven months. In 2018 and 2019, the caseload further dropped to 884 and 881 respectively. This year, the city has recorded the lowest caseload -- 119 -- for the corresponding period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Civic officials said the fall in numbers is due to preventive measures taken during the pandemic. "Since the starting of the pandemic in March, we initiated disinfection work in public places. On a larger scale, we carried our sanitation and fumigation work. We also oiled the stagnant water to destroy breeding grounds of mosquitoes," said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     According to data procured from the insecticide department, compared to last year, more breeding grounds of aedes mosquitoes, which spread dengue, were destroyed this year. While 51,509 breeding grounds were destroyed in 2019, BMC increased its tally to 62,872 this year. The most breeding grounds were found in E (Byculla) and G/South (Elphinstone) wards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A senior officer from the insecticide department said, "Our whole department was given the responsibility of disinfection and sanitisation in societies with infected patients. Despite working round the clock, we paid equal attention to take precautionary measures for mosquito-borne diseases, which helped to control the [number of] cases."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Another reason for lower numbers may be the restricted movement due to lockdown. Dr Manjusha Agarwal, general physician at Global Hospital, Parel said, "During this ongoing pandemic, people have tried to maintain a clean environment and focus on improved sanitation. Also as people are spending less time outdoors due to the restrictions imposed in the lockdown, it could have resulted in fewer dengue cases."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist from Khar said, the pandemic had helped to diagnose patients early, which in turn may have prevented fatalities. "As the symptoms of dengue are similar to Covid-19, many dengue patients were diagnosed early at fever camps. This helped to provide treatment without delay," said Dr Srivastava.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Despite the improved figures for dengue, doctors advised that the authorities should not let down their guard. "On a regular basis, the civic body should keep removing the scrap materials and tyres which turn into breeding grounds," said Dr Srivastava.

It’s always possible that the president will choose to pass on his legacy to someone who is not biologically or legally related to him. There will be plenty of aspirants to the role of being an Honorary Trump. “Conservative populist” Senator Josh Hawley seems especially well-positioned, though Trump’s former 2016 rivals Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have had their noses up the presidential posterior for a long time now, and other up-and- comers from media star Tucker Carlson to the grim young right-wing pol Tom Cotton are in his orbit. But by and large, Trump’s moves are best understood as following the patterns of crime bosses, for whom family is the best hedge against betrayal. It’s likely his second option will be someone in the family photo above. Donald Trump’s first option, of course, will be to stay in charge of his political enterprise as long as he is alive and not in the hoosegow.

If you're new to _Destiny 2_ altogether, the revised "New Light" campaign gets new characters up to speed quickly and efficiently. If you've tried the franchise in the past and disliked it, however, this expansion probably won't win you over. Destiny is still Destiny, despite these changes; it may have been expanded, but the core game remains.

"It was not an easy decision to take but one which is necessary under the circumstances. We need to work hard to deal with the human factor in the examination system.

"Large events in the heart of a busy market town are never dull, as we know only too well here in Stradbally. A crisis emerged last night when we found out that our Festoon Lights for Main Street had been pallet delivered to Waterford, with no guaranteed delivery for tomorrow. Huge thanks to Niall Walker for driving late last night to get the pallet and set us up for our day of major operations. Niall has been a powerhouse and main driver in sourcing, pricing and getting discounts on these commercial lights ever since Ann Simpson’s Go Fund Me page was set up three weeks ago. Not only this, but Niall has been working tirelessly behind the scenes to secure more funding for Stradbally Christmas Lights from Laois County Council.

As of May 2020, countries worldwide are taking no chances with COVID-19 and have unveiled stimulus packages worth billions of dollars to salvage their battered economies. While it may seem that the Excavators industry will be irreparably damaged, all is not yet doom and gloom. Major companies in the Excavators market may decide to adopt a wait and wait approach. In conclusion, the Excavators market is ever changing at the moment, but the long-term prospects are likely to be bright. Organizations are advised to view the current global scenario as an opportunity and not a crisis to push the necessary changes to secure their long-term prosperity. Companies that fail to do so would only have themselves to blame if they fall behind their nimbler rivals more attuned to the direction in which the COVID-19 winds are blowing.

Unfortunately, not all songs hit the mark, with the track ‘Driverless Cars’ acting as almost instantly forgettable filler.
