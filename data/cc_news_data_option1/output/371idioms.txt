JALANDHAR Six years after Divya Jyoti Jagriti Sansthan (DJJS) head Ashutosh Maharaj was declared clinically dead by doctors, his body continues to be preserved in a freezer at Nurmahal, around 34 km from here, and his disciples and the dera management still believe that the self-styled godman is in 'samadhi' (deep meditation) and will return on his own.On the night of January 29, 2014, a team of doctors was called from Satguru Apollo Hospital in Ludhiana after the dera head suffered uneasiness. Later, he was declared clinically dead.Even as eminent political leaders were given the message about the last rites of Maharaj, the dera leaders who arrived from Delhi started claiming the next morning that their spiritual guru was not dead but had gone into meditation.NO ACCESS TO EVEN VIP VISITORSThe room where the dera head's body has been kept is guarded by a group of followers round the clock and the people are not allowed to go inside it. The Punjab Police personnel are deployed around the dera.Even the VIP visitors are kept away from the closely guarded room, dera insiders revealed.Chief ministers of Haryana and Himachal, Manohar Lal Khattar and Jai Ram Thakur, and Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh's wife and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur were among the eminent leaders who visited the dera last year. Only three to four persons from the top management of DJJS are allowed to go inside the room. Besides, government and private doctors go there for routine check-ups after three months, dera sources said. 'NO SIGNS OF BODY DECOMPOSITION'Jalandhar civil surgeon Dr Gurinder Kaur Chawla, who is part of the doctors' panel, told HT that there are no signs of decomposition of the body yet.The check-ups are conducted on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court, which had allowed the dera to keep the body in a freezer."Temperature is maintained regularly in the freezer and we have been told that DJJS functionaries apply some medicines on the body on a regular basis," a doctor who visited the dera said, on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, sect members remain busy in various chores at the 50-acre dera and some shops situated inside its premises.Some disciples told HT that they have firm belief that Ashutosh Maharaj will return from his 'samadhi' despite the fact that he has been declared clinically dead. Some others, however, said that they are only concerned with his teachings. Swami Narinder, a dera functionary, said Ashutosh Maharaj had announced during his discourses that he would go into 'samadhi' and will return later to spread his message around the world.Meanwhile, Narinder denied that a rift in the management over controlling the dera was behind the decision to keep Maharaj's body in a freezer. There are around a dozen members of the management that runs the DJJS affairs, he said. He claimed that all followers are still associated with the sect "as they know that Maharaj will return."However, some insiders admitted that that there has been a slight dip in the followers of DJJS. PRO-MODI APPROACHMeanwhile, the biggest change DJJS has witnessed in the past four-five years is that its top functionaries strongly defend the policies and decisions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and support Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on key issues. Dera spokespersons are often seen on TV debates and social media extending whole-hearted support to Modi and his government.

With three days left for Swachh Survekshan-2020 to conclude, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), which is eyeing the top ‘Swachh’ spot this time, is keeping its fingers crossed and is hoping Mysureans go all out to vote for Mysuru for improving its chances.
 As on today, about 66,000 citizens have voted for Mysuru. In the next three days, the MCC hopes to garner at least 50,000 to 60,000 more votes to put Mysuru in a “comfortable” position among cities vying for the national recognition on the cleanliness front.
 Citizens can vote for Mysuru in the survey by going to the webpage https://swachhsurvekshan
 2020.org/Citizen
 Feedback
 “The citizens’ response was not on the expected lines but the voting has gained some traction now. We have now reached the 66,000-mark. People can spare a minute, vote for Mysuru even now and share their feedback. Hopefully, lots of Mysureans make use of the next three days to vote to the maximum to see their city top the list of ranks,” said MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde.
 Speaking to _The Hindu_ , Mr. Hegde said Mysuru did not get the feedback as expected even in the past, and cities such as Indore and Ambikapur overtook Mysuru as they received maximum votes from their residents. “We slipped in ranking although we obtained a good score in other parameters. I am still hoping to see the votes to cross 1.50 lakh if the citizens make up their mind and vote,” he stated.
 Pourakarmikas have entered the field, making door-to-door visits in their wards and requesting the people to vote. “They know people in the wards as they go there daily for cleaning and collecting garbage. Their involvement is making a difference as the voting has seen a jump. After their work too, they are going in groups seeking votes for Mysuru. Our health teams too are interacting with the citizens, sharing the ward issues with them,” said MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj.
 He told _The Hindu_ that the pourkarmikas, numbering around 2,000, have taken up this campaign on their own.
 Expressing confidence of garnering more votes in the next three days, Dr. Nagaraj said the entire MCC staff is on the job and making team effort to maximise the votes.
 The teams have targeted educational institutions to increase the votes, engaging the students. JSS Mahavidyapeeta alone has about 31 institutions and a vast student base. The staff and students have promised to give their feedback, he added.
 Dr. Nagaraj said the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) has given a LED- mounted vehicle to encourage its customers to vote for Mysuru in the survey.
 The vehicle goes around its 20-plus outlets all over the city and the outlet staff requests the customers to do their job.
 Some NGOs have sent their volunteers to the campaign to urge the citizens to vote for Mysuru.
 “Let’s Do It Mysore has roped in college students for the job. Others too have chipped in,” he said.
 The college students, numbering about 150, have been tasked with getting as many citizens as possible to participate in the effort to put Mysuru in a better position this time.
