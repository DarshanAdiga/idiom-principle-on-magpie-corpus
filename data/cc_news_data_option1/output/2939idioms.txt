According to Anderson, the two of them had wanted to make a new _Dune_ trilogy for a while but were busy working on the upcoming movie, and actually came up with the idea while the movie was being filmed. Their goal is for this new trilogy to be just as accessible for new readers as it would be for hardcore fans — to help audiences understand the characters and world before reading the first book or, perhaps, seeing the upcoming movie.
 “We might be getting a lot of brand-new readers, so we didn’t want to do something that was in a very obscure timeframe. We wanted something that could be easily accessible and familiar to anybody who’d just read the first _Dune_ novel,” Anderson said during the panel. “It’ll be a familiar way to get everybody right up to speed to reading _Dune_ and seeing the film, so we felt this was the right time for bringing this story.”

International expressions of disappointment and regret won’t result in anything except an eventual acceptance of Turkey’s decision. With the exception of the Greek government and some Christian clergymen, the Hagia Sophia’s reclassification is not expected to entail a serious political wave. The Western media will resume its ideologically-charged campaign by claiming that Turkey intends to reinstate the caliphate. Political leaders will occasionally employ certain symbols but ultimately focus on real interests and calculations. From their perspective, Turkey’s moves in Syria, Iraq, Libya and the Eastern Mediterranean will be the only steps worth considering. Symbols and ideological labels will only be invoked to resist those moves. At the end of the day, Ankara won’t stop trying to protect its national interests proactively just because some people describe Turkey’s policy as neo- Ottomanist or Islamist.

House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn will offer legislation Monday to rename a House-passed voting rights bill after the late Rep. John Lewis, who was brutalized in the 1960s during efforts to secure voting rights for African Americans.
 "Congressman Clyburn is offering legislation to rename H.R. 4 The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act tomorrow. The name change is expected to pass by unanimous consent," Clyburn's spokeswoman, Hope Derrick, said in a Sunday statement.
 The House passed the measure in December that would restore a key part of the historic Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court struck down in 2013. Democrats have pushed the Republican-controlled Senate to take up the legislation following the passing earlier this month of Lewis, a longtime Georgia congressman and icon of the Civil Rights Movement.

The Hagia Sophia’s reclassification as a mosque and last week’s Friday prayer, which drew around 350,000 people, including Turkish statesmen, continues to make waves. No, this piece is not about reactions to that decision. I will not delve into its international reception, Greece’s response or the significance of that ancient temple serving as a mosque again for Turkey. Instead, I intend to reach certain conclusions about Turkish foreign policy on the basis of the Hagia Sophia’s reopening. I will also analyze what kind of strategic initiatives Turkey can take when it is absolutely necessary.

During the SDCC panel, Anderson said it was one of the first books he and Brian Herbert worked on together, and he and Herbert were excited to see how the younger versions of these iconic characters were visually represented (for example, Baron Harkonnen is _a lot_ leaner than his _Dune_ counterpart). _House Atreides_ is actually part of a trilogy, the others being _House Harkonnen_ and _House Corrino_ (they’ve also gotten reprints in anticipation of the graphic novel series). No word whether they’ll be creating graphic novels based on the other books in the trilogy, though I’m sure it’s possible given everything else they have in the works. Herbert expressed joy at all the projects they have in development, including some computer games, but emphasised the importance of keeping the integrity of his father’s work alive.
 “ _Dune_ , like our universe, is expanding, but we’re very conscious that we don’t want to expand it too far,” Herbert said. “We don’t want to come up with material that the hard-core _Dune_ fans will not appreciate, because _Dune_ above all is a very high-quality work, and we struggle to maintain that quality.”

Saturday, several “transpotainment” companies kept operating with adjustments saying the Mayor was setting a double standard for certain businesses.
 Some party barge owners said looking at the mayor's Order 9, they felt if they stopped allowing alcohol on board, they were not acting any different than tour trolleys.
 “It’s a sight seeing tour with music and fun,” said Nick Lyons, owner of party truck company Hell on Wheels Nashville.
 Lyons told NEWS4 he’s keeping his party truck business open.
 “It just genuinely seems like there’s a lot of double standards happening. What’s the difference between six people on a bike peddling or 10 people on a truck partying and 30 people on a trolley sight seeing?” asked Lyons.
