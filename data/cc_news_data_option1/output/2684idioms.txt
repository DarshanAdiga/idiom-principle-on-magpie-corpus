"He was obviously excited. Said he was planning on traveling like the Michelin Man today through the airport," Francona said.
 DeShields is in his first season with the Indians, who acquired him in December from Texas in the trade involving ace Corey Kluber.
 In Oakland, right-hander Mike Fiers returned to the field for workouts after being delayed by what manager Bob Melvin referred to as a "pending issue," which wasn't injury-related. Fiers pitched his second career no-hitter last season and was the whistleblower in the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal last fall.
 The defending AL champion Astros were without infielder Alex Bregman on Wednesday because his test results were delayed.
 "He's probably frustrated because I know how hard Alex works and how dedicated he is to getting off to a good start," manager Dusty Baker said. "There's nothing that we can do about it."
 The Cubs have thus far avoided any positive tests, a development outfielder Kyle Schwarber insists cannot be attributed to mere luck.
 "You see some names around the league who have got the virus and you're surprised, and to see the way that we haven't had any tests come back positive, I mean, that's unbelievable," Schwarber said. "I think it's just a testament to what our guys did off the field taking this serious, knowing that we can do something special here and we're going to need every single guy in it at the end of the day."
 With the start of the season just over two weeks away, several teams held intrasquad games as the next step in gearing up for the real thing.
 Washington ace Max Scherzer threw 48 pitches at Nationals Park and made quite an impression on manager Dave Martinez.
 "We wanted to keep him at 50, three full innings, but he looked good," Martinez said. "The key now is his turnaround. Let's see how he feels (Thursday)."
 Carter Kieboom, the rookie who's the favorite to replace Anthony Rendon at third base for the defending World Series champions, said it was his first time facing Scherzer since spring training in 2018.
 "Same outcome as today," Kieboom said. "I struck out."
 Tampa Bay's Charlie Morton allowed two runs and four hits over four innings in a simulated game at Tropicana Field. Lefties Blake Snell and Ryan Yarbrough and right-hander Trevor Richards also pitche.
 "It was nice to get the guys in the box, get them some live looks and also try to ramp up the intensity," Morton said.
 The Detroit Tigers had their first intrasquad scrimmage on at Comerica Park with no fans in the stands. The crack of the bat and pop of the ball hitting the mitt were often the only sounds on a scorching afternoon.
 "We're just happy we got back on the field," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said.
 The Orioles were poised to hold an intrasquad game under the lights at Camden Yards without shortstop José Iglesias, who has a sore back.
