After an incredibly long and tumultuous road to the screen, movie fans can finally sit down and watch Dave Bautista's new action comedy, _My Spy_. The film was originally supposed to come out in August 2019, but was ultimately delayed for a March 13th release earlier this year. When the coronavirus delays began, _My Spy_ was moved back to April, before being pulled from the theatrical release schedule altogether. Amazon eventually bought the distribution rights from STX and announced plans to release it exclusively on Prime Video while movie theaters remain closed. Just a couple of weeks ago, Amazon revealed that _My Spy_ would debut on the service on June 26th.
 That premiere date has finally arrived, giving audiences the chance to check out the movie that some have been waiting to see since last summer. _My Spy_ was supposed to be released almost a year ago in theaters, and it's just now getting its debut online and in some drive-ins across the country.
 Amazon and STX have not released the particulars of the deal to acquire the film, so it's anyone's guess as to how much the streaming service paid for the _My Spy_ rights. The film cost about $18 million to produce, so it's clear that STX felt it could make back more of that money by selling to a streamer like Amazon, rather than moving it to the fall, which is now shaping up to be a very crowded season at the theater.
  _My Spy_ stars Bautista as a spy who goes undercover to watch a family, only to be foiled rather quickly by their nine-year-old daughter, played by _Big Little LIes_ ' Chloe Coleman. The girl then blackmails Bautista's character into teaching her how to be a spy. The film is directed by Peter Segal with a script from Jon and Erich Hoeber.
 Chris Bender and Jake Weiner produce _My Spy_ alongside Bautista, Segal, Jonathan Meisner, and Gigi Pritzker. Rachel Shane and Adrian Alperovich are executive producers.

In another first-in-the-nation move to tackle climate change, California will require automakers to sell more electric trucks starting in 2024. The measure, approved unanimously Thursday by the California Air Resources Board, says that by 2045 all new trucks sold in the state should be zero-emissions.
 The new rule aims to improve air quality and help the state achieve its aggressive climate goals. At least seven other states and the District of Columbia may follow suit.
 Some industry groups opposed the move, but a growing number of automakers have announced plans to make electric vans or trucks. And in a sign of advancing battery power technology, this emerging market even includes electric big rigs — the heavy duty trucks that transport freight across the country.

With most film and TV projects halted for months by the novel coronavirus pandemic, voice actors and animators have been among some of the hardest- working people in show business this spring. Sony Pictures Animation chief Kristine Belson thinks that, with demand for content not slowing down and an uncertain future for many productoins, the film industry could see a surge in animation projects intended for adult consumption. In an animation industry that was already starting to move toward a more diverse slate of content, Belson believes the pandemic will accelerate that process, according to statements she made yesterday at the Collision From Home virtual conference.
 That is not to say that we're going to go straight to seeing slasher movies animated. Sony seems to feel that Disney, Dreamworks, and others have saturated the market for kids' content, and that the way to increase their footprint is to diversify their audience.
 "I don't think you're going to see more family animated movies because that's very saturated," Deadline quotes Belson as saying. "There will be more R-rated animated movies....There are a couple we're working on and we're really excited about releasing our first one. I think you're going to see PG-13 animated movies, which is something you haven't seen before. Harder action- adventure sort of stuff."
 The conversation touched on a number of ways that the pandemic has impacted the way animation is being made, ranging from the positive (voice actors and animators being able to rig their work at home) to the negative (the creative process is hampered when everyone else is muted so you can't get a sense for how people are reacting).
 The idea of animation moving into a more adult area is not new, obviously; in addition to decades of highly-visible Japanese and indie animation that has consistently done action, romance, and other non-kids' themes, we have years of _The Simpsons_ and Adult Swim at this point, normalizing for almost everyone in America that cartoons with a grown-up sensibility aren't an strange, even if they are an outlier in the market. With the artistic cred lent by _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_ and, as Belson noted, competitors who have a lock on the hearts and minds of the younger audience, it seems Sony believes its best shot at becoming a powerhouse in the animation space is to adopt this new model -- and the pandemic is almost providing proof of concept.

How June 26 came to be marked as National Beauticians Day is unknown but stylists and beauticians or cosmetologists have been around for many many years. It is only fair that they get a day all to themselves considering the fact that they put their lives on the line everyday to make people look good. They have to deal with potential health risks from the many chemicals that are present in salon products that are used for treating hair and nails.

Poi De Luca spiega come e stato individuato il focolaio e le fughe dalla zona rossa: "Una donna di nazionalita bulgara ha partorito a Sessa Aurunca - ricostruisce - ogni paziente viene sottoposto a tampone ed e risultata positiva, il bambino non contagiato. Scopriamo cosi l'assembramento nelle 5 palazzine a Mondragone e le mettiamo in quarantena. L'isolamento durera 15 giorni".
