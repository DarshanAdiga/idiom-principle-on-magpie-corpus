Twenty-five years ago this month, country music was turned upside down when Canadian singer Shania Twain released her second studio album, "The Woman In Me." It made her one of the most popular stars in the genre and also served as a stepping stone to what would become an impressive international career.      "The Woman In Me" was not a typical album by an up-and-coming artist. Rather, it was a testament of the human spirit. Twain wrote or co-wrote each of the album's 12 tracks with rock producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange. For those who follow music, Lange probably is best-known for his work with Bryan Adams and Def Leppard.      Twain's album went on to produce eight charting singles and sell an impressive 20 million copies.      Twain had a love for rock 'n' roll, while Lange's interest in American country music was growing. The two bonded and Twain's sound began to evolve. Her record company was somewhat caught in the middle, but were pressing her for an album. Despite feeling her new sound was "less country," Polygram/Mercury opted to move forward and let Lange produce the album.      The album's first single, "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?," fell along the lines of country, while the follow-up single, "Any Man Of Mine," became a massive crossover hit. It quickly topped the Billboard Country Singles chart before crossing over to Top 40.      "Any Man Of Mine" was a major success on both the country and pop radio formats. Twain's star grew by leaps and bounds.      I remember the first time I heard the song and thought, "What?! This is country music?" I liked it.      "The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You)" followed suit, hitting the country chart. In this case, Twain made her way onto the Adult Contemporary chart, too.      Next, Twain and Lange had recorded two distinct versions of the singles "(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!" and "You Win My Love." Each were recorded differently for country audiences and pop-rock audiences. Can we say brilliant?      Remixed songs were nothing new 25 years ago, but if you were a country performer, it was new territory. Twain was about to become globally known.      ″(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!" and "You Win My Love" both hit No. 1 on the country chart, but "I'm Outta Here!" lived up to its title. The song became a global smash.      "No One Needs To Know" and "Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore)" continued her hit streak.      By that point, the world knew Twain. Listeners also were learning a little more about the woman behind the music. Her life was not glamorous before. In fact, it was quite sad. She lost both her parents in a tragic accident and was left to care for her siblings. She put off her dreams of being a singer to do so.      The last single to come from "The Woman In Me" was "God Bless The Child," an a cappella prayer she said to herself after her parents passed away. The heartfelt song was the last track recorded for the album and perhaps the most personal.      "The Woman In Me" was named ACM and Billboard's Country Album Of The Year. It also earned Twain her first Grammy for Best Country Album. And it was the pre- cursor to Twain's massive album, "Come On Over," which made her a superstar.      David T.

Running mate Luke Frazier, who will play for Dayton next season, scored 18 points and added five assists, two blocks, six rebounds, and four steals.
 The Cougars had won 10 straight games coming in, and did everything they could to pull this one out, but it wasn’t meant to be this time.
 “I thought what really helped (Glenville) is that were very patient with what they were doing offensively,” Lake Catholic coach Matt Moran said. “They hit shots after running off 20 or 30 seconds, and that got us out of our game a little bit. Hat’s off to them for being disciplined.”
 Eller, sitting dejectedly at his locker afterward, wasn’t happy with the call that went against his team, but reflected fondly on his time at Lake Catholic.
 “I purposely threw it off the rim, and they said it was a lane violation, that I went too early,” Eller said. “I disagreed, but it’s the ref’s call.
 “It’s been a pleasure playing with all these guys, and I’m sure gonna miss it. I just want to thank Coach Moran for all that he has done for us.”
 Malchesky added 11 points, and Fitzgerald had nine for the Cougars. Along with Eller, Frazier, and DeMitro, the Cougars will lose eight seniors to graduation.
 “This is the closest our team has been in all four years,” Frazier said. “It’s like a brotherhood, and that’s what I’m going to miss the most. I’m going to miss Luka, he’s like my brother. I’m going to miss playing with him.”
 Malchesky, Fitzgerald, and Gavin Davenport will be key returnees for Moran and the Cougars next season. Lake Catholic won a NCL title for the second consecutive season, quite an accomplishment considering the strength of that league, which will disband after this school year.
 But it will be awhile until Moran and his charges get over this one, and are able to sit back and enjoy the memories from this unforgettable season, in which they finished as the No. 1 team in The News-Herald Top of the Crop.
 “The last eleven games everything seemed to go our way, and today just wasn’t one of those days,” Moran said. “It is what it is. We can’t hang our hat on this last game. What these guys accomplished for this school and this community, can’t be taken away. I think those things will always outweigh this loss.”

Consumer appliances company Somany Home Innovation Ltd (SHIL), which sells its products under the brand name Hindware Appliances, is looking to set up its first company-owned plant at Hyderabad for manufacturing water heaters. The estimated capacity of the proposed plant is likely to be close to six lakh units per annum.
 According to Rakesh Kaul, CEO and Whole-Time Director, SHIL, the company which is primarily into three categories – water purification system, air purification system and kitchen chimneys – depends on third-party manufacturing at present.
 “We have bought land (for setting up the plant) in Hyderabad and we should be able to firm up on our plans for the unit, including the estimated investments, in the next two months,” Kaul told _BusinessLine_.
 The water heater market in India is pegged at close to 3-3.1 million units annually. SHIL holds approximately 8 per cent of the market share with sales of around 2.5 lakh units per annum.
 “We hope to be able to raise our share in the water heater market (in India) to 12 per cent in the next two years,” he said.
 The plant, once operational, would also help the company cater to SAARC countries, particularly Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The company recently started exporting some of its products to Nepal and Bhutan.
 SHIL has a strategic partnership with Groupe Atlantic, a Europe-based company known for its heating solutions segment. The tie-up with Atlantic will help the company scale up its presence in international markets, particularly SAARC countries, he pointed out.
 ## Growing business
 The consumer business vertical, which was a part of HSIL in 2015 with a turnover of ₹18-20 crore, was demerged in August 2019 and placed under SHIL. In financial year 2019-20, SHIL is expecting to clock a turnover of around ₹540 crore.
 “We have been growing at a CAGR of around 45 per cent in the last four years. We have seen good growth in our kitchen appliances, which now accounts for nearly 40 per cent of our business, air coolers (around 20 per cent) and water heaters (close to 18 per cent),” he said.
 Water purifiers and air purifiers are expected to be some of the emerging categories for the company going forward because of the low level of penetration of these in the country, he said.
 The company is expecting 35-40 per cent growth in business in the next financial year, backed by addition of new product categories. SHIL recently forayed into ceiling fans under the brand name ‘Hindware Snowcrest’.
 It is also in the process of considering the roll-out of one or two more products shortly. It is also betting big on IoT-enabled connected appliances. The company already has smart (IoT-enabled) kitchen chimney, water purifier and water heater. It is looking to bring internet connectivity to other range of products.
 SHIL also has retail stores under the brand name Evok, which is into home furnishing products ranging from furniture, home décor and modular kitchens, among others. It currently has 10 company-owned stores and 15 franchisee outlets. It hopes to take this to 50 stores in the next two years, primarily via the franchisee model.

PAGO PAGO, American Samoa (AP) — What does more than $500 million get you? For Mike Bloomberg, it was 175 winning votes in this U.S. territory — a group of Pacific islands with lush vegetation and stunning coastlines some 7,200 miles (11,600 kilometers) from where he once served as New York City's mayor.
 Bloomberg's lone primary victory in American Samoa, population 55,000, was an unorthodox and inauspicious culmination to a much-hyped but short-lived Democratic presidential campaign marked by unprecedented spending designed to make a splash in Super Tuesday states.
 In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, he did it.

SIDNEY, Iowa — Warmer than normal weather is bringing a short-term dose of good news to those worried about spring flooding along the Missouri River. But in the long term, the risk remains elevated.
 The warmth is melting the thick blanket of snow in the eastern Dakotas that forecasters feared would magnify flood risks if it melted in the midst of a rainstorm. Even better news: The odds favor continued warm weather into mid- March, and there are no obvious large, northern storms in the offing.
 “It’s a really, really good thing that we’re going to lose a lot of this snow,” Kevin Low, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service’s Missouri River Basin Forecast Center, said during a monthly phone briefing on river conditions. “It lessens the immediate threat.”

USD/JPY pair remained under some heavy selling pressure amid the global flight to safety. Collapsing US bond yields, Fed rate cut speculations continued weighing heavily on the USD. Bearish traders seemed unaffected by extremely oversold conditions ahead of the NFP report. The USD/JPY pair lost some additional ground on the last day of the week and tumbled to over six-month lows, below the 106.00 round-figure mark during the Asian session. The pair added to its recent heavy losses and remained under some heavy selling pressure for the second consecutive session on Friday. The downfall marked the pair's third day of a negative move in the previous four - also the fifth in the last seven - and was sponsored by the coronavirus-led selloff across the global equity markets. Bears remained in control Growing market concerns that the virus outbreak will have a bigger than previously estimated impact on the global economy weighed in investors' sentiment. The nervousness was evident from a fresh wave of risk-aversion trade, which provided a strong boost to the Japanese yen's safe-haven status and kept exerting pressure on the major. Apart from the global flight to safety, firming market expectations that the Fed will again have to cut interest rates by 50 bps for the second time this month resulted into a plunge in the US Treasury bond yields. This eventually aggravated the prevailing bearish pressure surrounding the US dollar and further collaborated to the pair's downfall.
