“It was a lot of fun last year,” said Supervisor Rod Litzel. “The Scouts were pretty regular in bringing in bags of weeds, and they’d get a little money at the end of it. Plus they knew they had done something good for the environment.”


  The spread of all three species can be effectively controlled through pulling, as long as you do so before they go to seed in late August, said Thad Berrett, rangeland management specialist for the Bighorn National Forest.


  Pulling is often preferable to spraying because there are not the added risks of killing desirable plants in the area.


  Berrett said that residents pulled 3,350 pounds of weeds last summer – no small feat. But the impact grows exponentially considering that those weeds prevented tens of millions of seeds from being dispersed.


  The invasive species are probably familiar to anyone who gets out for a walk regularly. The species can be easily found throughout the county, including along the Clear Creek trail system, at the Mosier Gulch day-use area and at the Bud Love Wildlife Management Habitat area, as well as BLM and state lands around the middle fork of the Powder River west of Kaycee.


  The Weed and Pest District will provide maps of potential weed-collecting locations, Litzel said. Organizing a weed-pulling outing for groups or clubs can be a good fundraiser, Berrett said, and Weed and Pest is happy to direct groups to big patches of weeds. Private landowners are also encouraged to look for the weeds on their properties.


  Keeping weeds in check in Johnson County is a herculean effort. The county is bigger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined, so just knowing where a weed outbreak may occur takes more eyes

The Australian arm of IBM has made its financial results for 2019 available, reporting net profit of AU$109 million, slightly down from the AU$119 million made a year prior.


  Total revenue for the year, however, decreased by over AU$300 million to just shy of AU$2.6 billion, the cost of sales was reduced by around the same amount from AU$2.25 billion to AU$1.93 billion, while the company's selling, general, and administrative expenses remained steady at AU$453 million.


  All of IBM Australia's segments submitted weaker revenue across the board year on year. This consisted of a AU$1.04 billion contribution from its global technology services, down from AU$1.16 billion; AU$622 million from its cloud and cognitive software, compared to AU$726.7 million; global business services chipped in AU$33 million less with AU$503 million in revenue; intercompany services and sales provided AU$299 million, AU$15 million less year on year; while its systems sales earned AU$111 million, a AU$61 million drop from the year prior.


  Tax-wise, IBM Australia decreased its income tax payments from AU$52 million last year to AU$41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.


  Unlike last year, when the Australian arm of Big Blue paid a AU$150 million dividend to its parent companies, the company also declared that no dividend would be paid for the 2019 financial year.

The cast also found themselves questioning their previously held beliefs about the coughing major. Both remember the story, but embodying Charles and Diana allowed them to reflect on how it wasn’t just tabloid fodder — it was real people being taken to task by the media and the public as well as the courts.


  “The big question for me is whether or not they should have a criminal conviction,” says Clifford, who met Diana briefly on the last day of shooting. “That’s very serious and has impacted their lives immeasurably and negatively. I certainly question a lot of what I saw before. I don’t think we answer any of the questions we raise in the show — I think we leave it still pretty open- ended — but we do give a voice to a side of this story that’s never been told.”


  “There’s a real pile-on thing, certainly with social media, where everyone seems to jump on board things,” Macfadyen adds. “There’s very little nuance or real, careful thought. People rush to judgment, and they rush to knowledge. They need to know what the truth is, and it’s either black or it’s white. Life isn’t like that, I don’t think.”

Just after sunup, they had installed four new fire rings at the North Crandall trailhead, in the Sunlight District. The heavy duty fire rings were purchased by the club and carry a club brand, done by a club member with welding equipment, in case someone tries to steal them.


  It would be a chore to take; each is secured by several large steel pins locked into place with concrete.


  The back country group also reclaimed 30-foot-long timbers, cutting them into transportable-sized sections to build stanchion floors at Dead Indian. Over the years, horses have beaten the floors down until they dissolved into the earth, said project manager and Powell-area resident Frank Fagan.


  “We cut them down, recycled them, put a bolt through them and welded them back together so we could repurpose them back to this trail head,” Fagan said.


  It took a tractor and four men to move the new floors into place. But first they had to dig out the area below the heavy duty horse stanchions by hand. The moisture may have softened the soil a little, but the close quarters and work with spades was still hard on the back.


  Many of the jobs the group accomplishes are done deep in the hills. They spend days in the saddle removing fallen trees, fixing washouts, clearing bushes and overhanging limbs, removing old fences and marking trails.


  This chapter is the busiest in the U.S. The well-seasoned volunteers have cleared thousands of miles of trails in the Shoshone one obstruction at a time. Their contract with the Forest Service is to clear 100 miles a year, but they often do an extra 50 miles — and have more than once doubled their contracted yearly total.

With the first road trip and overnight stay of the season, also came a bit of slow start Sunday, Perleberg said. Still, the Roughriders scored two runs in the first inning, four in the second and the score was up to 12-2 before the damage was done.


  Mason Powell continued his big season at the plate with four RBI’s, including a bases-clearing double in the bottom of the third inning to make it 9-0. Cole Swisher also drove in pair of runs, one in the first and one in the second inning, and Jason Fink had an RBI in the fifth.


  Kaden Race picked up the win on the mound, pitching four innings, surrendering two runs and striking out four. Garrett Lynde closed out the final inning, after the Roughriders scored three in the bottom of the fifth to end the game 12-2 on the run rule.


  “It was nice to see us put a team away, especially in the heat like that and conserve some energy,” Perleberg said. “Then in Game 2, we faced a really good arm. And (Hayden) Sylte was a dude on the mound for us. He really threw the ball well.”

The Kodak story would have been different had the leadership been informed enough about new trends in the industry. If that had been the case, the invention by one of its engineers would not have been discountenanced and the company would have been the pioneer of the digital technology. Leaders need to understand that in the current dispensation, knowledge becomes obsolete at the speed of light. The implication of this is that what once worked will no longer work. What was once the latest and best technology will soon be worsted by a new one. A new normal will always emerge but only those who are prepared for it will be able to seize the accompanying opportunities. The key to understanding this is to be unrepentantly committed to self improvement. Those who are unrelenting about self improvement are always the first to know when the trend is about to change and they take advantage of it before others even get wind of the change.

During an ensuing custody battle, Reade said she feared Dronen would beat their daughter if left alone with her for too long.


  An official evaluation attributed Dronen’s eruptive anger to a tumultuous childhood, but suggested that Reade was exaggerating the threat, describing her as having “personality characteristics that predispose her to dramatically respond to a variety of situations.” Reade’s fear for her daughter, the evaluator wrote, was based less on a realistic assessment of risk than on her “unresolved anger towards her ex-husband.”


  Dronen did not dispute Reade’s account of the violence on Feb. 21, calling it inexcusable. But according to the court record, he asserted that Reade had previously hit him in the face and, at one point, made a false allegation to get his probation revoked, resulting in the issuance and then withdrawal of an arrest warrant. (Reade denied doing so in a court declaration, and said she never initiated violence.)


  In short, Dronen declared, “abuse, sexual harassment and other traumatic incidents” in Reade’s life were the “underlying psychological reason” she was “making me out to be some sort of monster.”


  Reade would go on, actually, to describe him as a potential murderer. Dronen’s probation officer, she told her friend Wendy Dale, with whom she briefly worked on a biographical project a few years later, had warned her that her life was in danger, and that she should flee the state and change her identity. (The probation officer declined to comment.) Later, Reade would write that she learned her ex-husband’s “DNA was collected by the FBI for two missing women’s cases.”


  Apparently because of his record with Reade, Dronen was in fact among scores of local men questioned in the disappearance of two local women, two people familiar with the investigation said. But within weeks in 1999, police had traced the women’s murders to a convicted serial killer, Rex Allan Krebs; a senior investigator said DNA was used only sparingly and was not collected by the FBI.

Call it providence, or just straight-forward human compassion; but for the 11 migrant workers from Odisha, who had walked for over 48 hours from the outskirts of Tiruppur hoping to find a way back home, Krishnagiri was where they could find help to head back home.


  Having walked for a little more than two days, after they set out from the outskirts of Tiruppur on Friday, Malya Ghantayat and 10 others, including a woman, were spotted by a journalist with an evening daily while walking on the highway in Krishnagiri.


  He took them to a nearby eatery and arranged for their food. He also posted a photo of their plight in the local news group prompting immediate action from the District Collector S. Prabhakar.


  Dr. Prabhakar sought out their contact number and arranged for them to be brought to the Collectorate. In the meantime, he also alerted the Collector of Tiruppur. Incidentally, there was train for migrant workers leaving for Odisha from Tiruppur on Sunday night. Immediately, Dr. Prabhakar arranged for a vehicle for the 11 workers, and sent them off to be dropped off at Tiruppur, some 230 km away.


  Malya Ghantayat’s voice quivered with emotion over phone as he along with the 10 others were being driven back in a comfortable van. “I can’t express how happy I am now. We never imagined we would see our families this soon. We left by foot because we had no information on trains. Every time we went to the Collectorate, police sent us back because of overcrowding. So, we decided to walk to Odisha,” says Mr. Malya. They were employed in a vest printing unit in the outskirts of Tiruppur town until the lockdown. “When the lockdown came, we were paid, and we ate with that money. Soon, we ran out of money. We survived with rations given to us,” he says.


  As they journeyed, they were filled with gratitude for the sudden turn of fortune that saw them on foot, hungry and thirsty during the start of the day, and then being driven back to a train back home hours later.

Bernie Sanders did not catch fire because he sees class as the big problem. The black people telling white people that race is not important in things like the coronavirus pandemic, for example, are lying to gullible white people. The fact the whites elected Trump angers many black people. Trump's response is adding fuel to the fire. This is all about race. Class is a secondary issue when it comes to the anger.

  Cook for 20 to 30 minutes until the pies are puffy and golden.


  The recipe delighted other home cooks who said they couldn't wait to try it.


  'Thank you for this recipe, I would have never tried it in a slow cooker!' one woman said.


  'Well done making a recipe from scratch, your pies look absolutely delicious. I am going to try this recipe myself to the letter. Thank you!' said another.


  The woman who created the recipe said she used the Breville 'Fast Slow Cooker', which is currently reduced from $329 to $249 at Myer, but similar devices are available from other retailers for a fraction of that cost.


  Kmart sells five litre pots for just $19 while online retailer The Good Guys stock a 3.5 litre Russell and Hobbs machine for $35.

HOLLAND -- On Saturday morning, hundreds of people lined River Avenue in front of Holland City Hall to call for justice for George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck earlier this week.


   


  Holland's peaceful protest came after a long night of protests across many major cities in the U.S., including Detroit and Chicago, during which police and protesters clashed and hundreds were arrested.


   


  In Holland, about 350 people held signs with messages like "Justice for George Floyd" and "Black Lives Matter" along both sides of River between 10th and 12th Street. Cars honked in support of the protesters as they drove by.


   


  Although the Minneapolis police officer who was filmed with his knee on Floyd's neck has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, protesters in Minneapolis and elsewhere are calling for the arrest of three other police officers who were present.


   


  "They watched. They had every opportunity to stop what took place. If you choose not to I think you're just as guilty as if you keep your mouth quiet and turn a blind eye to something," said Henry Cherry, who attended the protest with his family Saturday.


   


  Cherry said showing up Saturday was not just about George Floyd, or about showing support for protesters elsewhere. Holland has racial issues of its own, he said.


   


  "I think it would be easy because we don't see the things happening in Minneapolis happening here now, so we don't think problems of injustice exist here," Cherry said.


   


  "If you look at it from a city standpoint, we have gentrification going on here, we have housing issues going on here. All this stuff is issues that we deal with and it all centers around race."


   


  The protest was organized by Gordon Wiersma, a pastor of Hope Church in Holland.


   


  "I felt like it was important for there to be a presence, a statement in Holland of awareness and solidarity and advocacy for justice," Wiersma said.


   


  Several local faith leaders participated in Saturday's demonstration, including Bryan Berghoef, pastor of Holland United Church of Christ and a Democratic candidate for Michigan's Second Congressional District.


   


  "I felt it was important to express solidarity with people of color in Holland and West Michigan and nationally, and to do so in a peaceful manner, and show that there's a large number of us that want to work toward racial equity and healing," Berghoef said.


   


  Word of the protest spread among Holland's faith communities, although people also said they joined spontaneously when they saw River Avenue lined with protesters.


   


  Wiersma said he was concerned about holding a protest in a pandemic but said he emphasized staying safe and was pleased to see most participants wearing masks and keeping their distance from one another.

The day is set aside to remember and honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice while serving in the nation’s armed forces. It is not about “the dead”, but the “war dead.” A huge disparity considering that only 7% of the American population has served in the military. Those killed while actively serving to defend the nation from enemies both foreign and domestic amounts to less than 1% of the nation’s 330 million summer starved Americans.


  It is an exclusive fraternity that no one joins by choice, and where so many of them gave the nation much more than they ever received.


  This unique group of Americans in eternal rest are too often forgotten, dismissed, or overlooked in the quest for a three-day weekend marking the summer solstice that is still nearly a month away.


  Lost on many is that each year on Memorial Day a national moment of remembrance takes place at 3 p.m., local time.


  Too often, Memorial Day is confused with Veterans Day that has its own specific and separate day in November for historic and traditional reasons that are also unfamiliar to many Americans. Veterans Day has yet to be compromised into a three-day weekend via the Uniform Monday Holiday Act and with good reasons.


  I often wonder what would be the response of those who gave their lives for our liberty about what makes American news’ headlines today.

A leader should also imbibe the attitude of gratitude. The easiest way to show that an individual is valued is to express gratitude to him. When this comes from the leader, it enlivens the people and encourages them to put in more effort. But showing gratitude, especially for activities that are regarded as run of the mill, does not come naturally to many people. Most leaders wait till a team member achieves an earth-shattering or a record- breaking feat before showing them appreciation. That is not quite right because it is capable of sending a message to the team that their efforts are not valued. However, while accomplishment of tasks that are regarded as outstanding may attract incentives, those that fall into other categories should be noted and commended, even if verbally. Gratitude should be the second nature of a leader. It should flow freely from him and the leader should show how every activity that is appreciated contributes to the overall objective of the organization so that the appreciation may be fully appreciated by the recipients.

One step led to another, they all blended into a rhythm, and last week Ridley hired Boyd to be the general manager of his Delco Desperados, the expansion team set to begin play this season in the new-look ABA, a men's professional league with a distant connection to the major league that once forced a merger with the NBA.


  A 2005 grad of Archbishop Prendergast High, Boyd was raised in Darby, Yeadon and Upper Darby, and for the last seven years has resided in Folcroft.


  As for Ridley, who owns the Desperados, he's confident the new general manager he hired is ready to face the music in a sprawling, 175-team league for former and aspiring basketball pros.


  “Coach Chrisheena is Delco born and raised,” Ridley said. “She was born there, raised there, lives there, runs business there, graduated from Neumann University. And she has always been involved peripherally with sports. Is she a sports junkie? No. She is a business owner. She is a professional, licensed, Christian life coach and a licensed school counselor.


  “She's a leader of people.”


  There are many ways to run a pro sports operation, and the Desperados have their vision of the sturdiest corporate tree. The Yeadon Kings, also scheduled to open play as an ABA expansion team in November, were quick to trust the basketball side of their operation to a longtime basketball coach and player, appointing noted Penn Wood High basketball alum Monique Boykins as general manager. The Desperados chose Boyd not as much for her deep basketball background, but for her business savvy and life-coaching skills.


  A former basketball and football player at John Bartram High who played some tailback at Howard University, Ridley is confident in his own eye for sports talent and likely will have the deepest impact on the Desperados' roster.


  “I am extremely excited for this opportunity that he saw fit to give me,” Boyd said. “He is giving me a chance. I am very optimistic. I am excited to see what this year and this season will bring.”


  It was not without an awareness of a continuing pandemic and the challenges it may present to any professional sports franchise that Ridley was careful to hire a general manager with a background in business. Boyd is the founder of “I See You”, a life-coaching concern. It is where she earned the nickname “Coach Chrisheena,” and where she came to become Ridley's business associate. A financial planner known as the “Wealth Builder,” Ridley finds Boyd's touch with helping clients adjust to changing life situations helpful.

Lucara's planned capital spending program for 2020 is largely focused on the initiation of our Karowe underground expansion project and was previously designed to ramp up in Q3, funded entirely from cash-flow, under a budget of $53 million. Given the present uncertainty related to our 2020 revenue forecast, this program is being re-scoped and reduced to focus on critical- path items through the remainder of the year. The underground expansion program has an estimated capital cost of $514 million and a five-year period of development. The Company expects to finance part of the capital cost with debt and the balance from cash flow generated by operations. In light of the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is also reviewing its original estimates and assumptions for the quantum and timing of cash flows expected from the current operations against the anticipated financing requirement for the underground expansion program.

Wine is not just a treat for the taste buds. It is also a feast for the eyes; from the deep berry colours of red wine to the delicate dance of bubbles in a glass of sparkling wine. When it comes to white wine, it should look nothing less than crystal clear. Yet winemakers are in a constant battle against protein haze; cloudiness that persists in wine, which must then be treated. Traditionally wine has been treated with a natural clay-like material called bentonite. The negatively-charged bentonite particles and the positively- charged proteins are attracted to each other and fall out of solution when they combine, so they can be filtered away from the final product. However, as bentonite is full of tiny pores, it also sucks up wine like a sponge, which reduces the volume available for sale.

With respect to the talk of the Indian ban on diamonds, I am not sure that it is needed now or right. Time has moved on from when it was originally talked about and the larger producers are or have already stopped or reduced their production and amending usually strict requirements for clients to purchase goods. It would make no logical sense to put a ban over the top of actions already being taken by these larger commercial producers to stem supply and reduce adverse impacts on the sector. It is important to note that, many producer countries rely heavily on the diamond mining sector and they too are suffering severely from the impact of COVID-19 - it is important for the diamond sector to open up as soon as it can so that those countries can start to rebuild their economies.

An Antioch University Seattle spokeswoman, Karen Hamilton, said McCabe had taken classes, but not enough to receive a degree; nor had she worked as an online instructor, as she claimed on resumes.


  The law school, where she received a degree in 2004, has declined to comment on her status in light of that revelation.


  After law school, McCabe took a job at the Snohomish County Center for Battered Women, where she was credited with creating a system to help victims navigate the courts.


  But a legal career would not come together. She did not pass the bar exam and by 2006 was back in California, working in the domestic violence program at the YWCA of Monterey. Soon, she was also testifying as an expert in domestic violence cases.


  “She was meticulous and caring and sensitive,” said Ayres, her former co- worker and friend. “She always had that very calm demeanor about her. Her voice is such that it puts you at ease.”


  But she frequently appeared at work late and had difficulty managing money as she tried to establish an upper-middle-class veneer for her daughter, Ayres said.

In a normal season, conventional wisdom had the Indians shipping Lindor at the July 31 trade deadline this summer if they were not in the playoff race. At the latest, he would be traded next winter while the Indians could still get something for him before he walks in free agency.
 Major-league teams will be uncertain how to proceed next winter no matter how 2020 unfolds. Players arbitration eligible, including Lindor, will have to get creative arguing they deserve a huge raise.
 Teams could be more hesitant to trade for Lindor on a one-year, 2021 rental if lost revenue from this season makes them unable to sign him long-term for the kind of money he wants. Lindor won’t announce his figure, but a conservative starting point would be the 10-year, $300 million deal the San Diego Padres gave Manny Machado in 2018.
 There is one way this messy situation could be beneficial to the Indians. Baseball could need two seasons to stabilize from the financial hit COVID-19 is causing.
 If Lindor’s agents conclude the free-agent contract Lindor seeks won’t be there after the 2021 season, maybe he could sign a one-year extension to play with the Indians in 2022 and then strike it rich in free agency when the baseball economy stabilizes.
 Lindor’s 2020 contract was for $17.5 million. Even in economically stressed times, a one-year contract for Lindor in 2022 would probably cost the Indians at least $22 million. Expecting the Indians to pay one player that much money for one year might be wishful thinking, just as excepting this season to meet the target to play on July 4 is starting to look like wishful thinking.

WHATEVER made Olubadan to have Adedibu/ We also have Omisore…(Oun t’ó m’Ólúbàdàn t’ó fi l’Ádédibú/ Àwa náa l’Ómísore)” This song was popular at Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rallies in Osun State some years ago. The rhythm there is in the strong, no-nonsense characters of Alhaji Lamidi Adedibu and Otunba Iyiola Omisore, two former chieftains of the PDP. Bold, brave, popular and go-getting, they were never afraid to pursue whatever they wanted. There was no fire those two could not quench with the strong breeze of their nostrils. You would understand my drift when you recollect that the late Ilorin songster, Odolaye Aremu, celebrated Adedibu as “son of a witch” who is also “half of Ibadan that is mistaken for a single human being.” And can we count the millions of humans inhabiting the high and low lands of Ibadan and divide the number by two? Whatever energy oozes from the answer we get approximates what Adedibu was at the height of his reign. Just across the eastern gates of Adedibu’s Oyo State was Omisore whose Emperor Shaka-like persona was enough to soak foes in their own urine. A lot has, however, changed since that song reigned at political carnivals. Adedibu died 11 June, 2008, twelve years ago. Senator Omisore moved over to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) exactly two years ago and was a decisive factor in Osun State’s governorship election of that year. Today, there is quiet in Adedibu’s Molete palace in Ibadan; the lair of the lion in Ile-Ife is on silent retreat too.

“After that first time I played there this fall, their recruiting coach texted me and we started chit-chatting back-and-forth at least twice a week. I went up there for a visit and they showed me around the school and the town.”


  Bower was hooked following the official visit.


  “I’m originally from a small town being from Headland and I wasn’t looking to go to any big cities where I would get lost or anything like that. I want to keep it simple and play the game I love,” Bower said. “I just fell in love with the city and the campus. That’s what finalized my decision of where I wanted to be.”


  The versatile Bower played first base during his freshman season at Coastal, but moved to left field as a sophomore.


  “I played in the outfield whenever I was 13 and 14 every now and again,” Bower said of his past experience. “I think the hardest thing with me was making sure whenever I got under the ball that I was staying with it in case the wind was moving it. I enjoyed it though.”


  Though recruited as a first baseman by West Alabama, Bower is open to playing the outfield if needed.


  “They recruited me to play first, but I’ve been talking to the coaches a lot and they told me that as long as I’m hitting the ball, there will be a spot for me on the field,” Bower said. “I work on hitting more than I work on anything, but I try to make sure that I do something fielding-wise at least once a week so I can be ready for anything that comes my way.”


  Bower believes the two years at Coastal Alabama certainly advanced his game.


  “The thing about Coastal was that everybody there was trying to be the best they can be there, while also helping one another be the best they can be,” Bower said. “You know, everybody was trying to push each other so we could excel and win and play to the best of our ability the entire season. I think I made an extremely good decision of where I wanted to go my first two years.”


  Bower has been home since March after COVID-19 caused college campuses to halt in-person classes and switch to on-line classes instead. He’s tried to stay sharp with his baseball skills.


  “I couldn’t get my hands on any weights, so I’ve been doing a bunch of push- ups and sit-ups and hitting off the tee in my backyard,” Bower said. “Just making sure that I’m doing something baseball related every day, and that way whenever the time came back around that I could get back on the field hitting and fielding ground balls that I would be still in the swing of things.”
