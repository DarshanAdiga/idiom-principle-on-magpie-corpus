Four of six people reported missing in a landslide in the Southeast Alaska town of Haines have been found safe, according to Alaska State Troopers. Two others are still missing, but rescue crews from Juneau have arrived in Haines.
 The landslide was caused by two days of torrential rainfall, unusual even in the temperate rainforest that makes up most of Southeast Alaska. The landslide on Beach Road destroyed four houses and covered the ground with about 9 feet of mud and downed trees, according to a troopers news release.
 Residents of several neighborhoods were evacuated Wednesday as other mudflows cut off roads, including the Haines Highway and the road to the local airport. Turbulence kept rescue helicopters from flying to the area on Wednesday afternoon.

Still, all Democratic senators voted against his nomination, making it an unusually close vote to confirm a Fed governor. Fed officials typically seek to remain above partisan politics. Waller had won some Democratic votes when the Senate Banking Committee approved his nomination in July.
 In contrast to Shelton, Waller is a conventional respected figure among economists. As an executive vice president of the St. Louis Fed, he has attended dozens of meetings of the Fed’s interest rate-setting policy committee, of which he will now become a voting member. His research has focused on how the Fed’s communications affect financial markets and on the benefits of an independent central bank. His term on the board will last through January 2030.
