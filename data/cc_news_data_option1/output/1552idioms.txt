At one point, some wondered if Burrow would try and leverage his way out of going to the Bengals, similar to the move Eli Manning in 2004, when he forced the San Diego Charges to trade him to the New York Giants.
 But Burrow appears poised to selected first in Thursday’s virtual draft, and to a team that needs more than a quarterback. Peyton Manning told Burrow treat it like a marathon, not a sprint, because he may lose more games in 2020 than in his college and high school career combined.
 “So that’s what I tried to encourage Joe and all the other rookie quarterbacks, that your rookie year is not going to be the same as your senior year in college," Manning said. "But if you learn how fast the defensive backs are, how soon you have to get rid of the ball, understand defenses, you can become a better player and really get it going the year or two after that.”
 As for the NFL record Manning set his rookie season ...
 “I threw 28 interceptions my first year. That’s still an NFL record,” Manning joked. “If Joe wants to break that, I’d be OK with that. We’d still be friends.”

So, teams are relying more on college game tape than ever before.
 A fortunate few, however, are sharing their stories through slick social media presentations thanks to a fortunate connection with Panini America, the trading card partner of the NFL, NFLPA and Collegiate.
 What began as a documentary series following five NFL draft hopefuls through their journey from college to the pros took on greater importance when the COVID-19 outbreak torpedoed the usual evaluations that take place between the scouting combine in late February and the NFL draft later this week.
 “Being able to have them get my name out there and share my story -- knowing not many have the same opportunity -- is a great feeling,” said Arizona State running back Eno Benjamin. “I’m grateful for that relationship.”
 The refocused “docu-series” also chronicles the paths of Utah State quarterback Jordan Love, Georgia running back De’Andre Swift and wide receivers Jerry Jeudy of Alabama and Antonio Gandy-Golden of Liberty University (whose episode drops on Monday).
 “We’ve had to audible quite a bit,” said Jason Howarth, vice president of marketing for Panini America. He said the original plan was to chronicle the five prospects’ journeys from the combine to draft night and arrival in the NFL, followed by the NFLPA Rookie Premier, the company’s annual photo shoot in May, which also has been canceled.
 “But our goal all along was to really tell the stories of five players in a compelling and meaningful way that showed and spotlighted who these players were,” Howarth said.
 That hasn't changed.

And, finally, it's important to note that all of this monstrous activity isn't limited to Birmingham. In 2015, a dead python - fourteen-feet in length - was found in Lancashire, U.K. The _Daily Mail_ newspaper ran an article on the story titled "Snakes on a Lane!" The story began: "The body of a giant 14ft python has been found by horrified walkers after it was dumped by a Lancashire canal. Local ramblers spotted the reticulated python near the High Street canal bridge on the Leeds and Liverpool canal in Rishton. It is not known whether the reptile, which is one of the biggest species of snake in the world, was drowned in the canal." It may well have been dumped by someone who had the huge snake as a pet - and that got out of hand. It is, however, intriguing that all of the cases we have addressed revolved around canals, which makes me wonder even more about the possibility of pythons finding ways to survive against the odds and living in our canals - for a while, at least.

“Last year was a good year in terms of a bunch of rookies coming in and having a lot of success, but if you look over the last several years, that second- and third-round receiver group has arguably been better than the first-round group,” said NFL draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah.
 “The challenge in scouting the position is it’s almost like two different games for college and the NFL in terms of what routes you’re asked to run, which are very limited at the college level,” Jeremiah said.
 “You watch a college game on Saturday you’re going to see a bunch of slants, hitches and go’s. It’s very limited in terms of what they ask them to do, very limited in terms of them having to read coverage and sight-adjust their routes. They don’t see very much press coverage.”
 Reading and reacting to coverage and keeping defenders from knocking them off their routes can prove difficult even for receivers who dominated college competition.

 We’re also presented with general manager Jerry Krause lighting the fuse to ensure this remarkable group will scatter at season’s end.
 Krause’s relationship with coach Phil Jackson has badly frayed, so Krause has insisted this will be Jackson’s last season with the team even though Jordan, the NBA’s best player, has said he will not play for the Bulls under anyone else. So Jackson has dubbed the season “the last dance.”

 33 The apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power, and they were all accorded great respect.
 34 None of their members was ever in want, as all those who owned land or houses would sell them, and bring the money from the sale of them,
 35 to present it to the apostles; it was then distributed to any who might be in need.

Under uncertain circumstances, the leading group of 29 organizations pushing for voters to have another option to make a change to the Illinois constitution this fall has lost some momentum as the coronavirus has placed the General Assembly on hiatus.
   
 But CHANGE Illinois is continuing to push through the deadline that is unlikely to be met.
   
 The Illinois House and Senate have until May 3 to approve a joint resolution that would change the process of how congressional and state legislative maps are drawn in Illinois. Each house would need to approve with a three-fifths vote -- 71 votes in the House and 36 in the Senate.
   
 Gov. JB Pritzker campaigned on reforming the redistricting process, often saying he would veto any map he thought was unfair.
   
 Maps are redrawn every 10 years with new census data and are currently drawn by legislators behind closed doors with no input from the public.
   
 The process has fueled skepticism from some in the public and in many government reform organizations, likening the process to lawmakers choosing their voters rather than voters choosing their lawmakers.
   
 As long as one party controls both houses, currently Democrats control Illinois, some lawmakers doubt that any change will happen regardless of the coronavirus or any deadlines.
   
 "It's a difficult bill to get at," said Sen. Steve McClure, R-Springfield. "Quite frankly it's because the Democrats have overwhelming power and why would they want to make maps fairer? It doesn't serve their interest, it just doesn't. ... And quite frankly, if Republicans were in power, they probably would do the same thing."
   
 Under the proposal, maps would instead be redrawn by an independent commission that would be "demographically, politically, and geographically representative" of Illinois. It would be transparent by releasing all communication and any data that went into making maps, and require at least 30 public hearings on the proposed maps before a final vote.
   
 Brad McMillan is co-chair on the board of directors for CHANGE (Coalition for Honest and New Government Ethics), a nonpartisan, nonprofit group. He said the coalition modeled the changes after other states, particularly California, which has turned the process over to an independent commission and, in his eyes, has been successful.
   
 One objective outcome of fairer maps is more competitive elections. Almost half of Illinois state legislative races in 2018 consisted of incumbents with no opposition, while over 80 percent of the races were "uncompetitive" -- where the winner receives over 55 percent of the vote.
   
 A combined 47 legislators are sponsors of the amendment and many are at least for tweaks to the process, but they also are cognizant of the General Assembly having no return date in the foreseeable future.
   
 "It'd be a shame if we didn't have an opportunity to debate that (fair maps amendment)," said Rep. Mike Murphy, R-Springfield. "If the May 3 deadline holds, in which I believe it probably will, if it holds it's going to be very difficult for us to get that accomplished."
   
 Sen. Andy Manar, D-Bunker Hill, supports the concept, but thinks the current proposal needs modification.
   
 "It's very narrow, but it's important and I think it needs to change slightly in order to best reflect the people of the state and the needs of the diverse communities in the state," Manar said. "But having said all that, I think it's going to be a challenge to act on any number of things for us and this would be one of those."
   
 The May 3 deadline must hold, however. There is no option for an extension because under state law, for a constitutional amendment to appear on the general election ballot, it must be approved by the legislature at least six months before that election, which this year is Nov. 3.
   
 But McMillan said the group hasn't given up on May 3 yet.
   
 "We haven't given up hope because it really just takes the leadership in the House and the Senate and the governor to decide that this is important enough," McMillan said. "What's unclear is whether they're going to try to convene at all before May 3 and if they don't convene before May 3, then it's a moot point."
   
 Time is running out, but the coalition and lawmakers respect the fact that Pritzker has much bigger priorities at the moment, leading the state's response to COVID-19.
   
 "Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and historic and everything rightfully has taken a backseat to everyone doing their best to curb the spread of the virus and protect and save lives," McMillan said.
   
 Therefore, the outlook for meeting the May 3 deadline is grim.
   
 "It's already very difficult to pass, now when you're having these deadlines coming upon us and you might not even be in until May 1 at the earliest, it's just almost impossible," McClure said.
   
 Rep. Tim Butler, R-Springfield, reminded that changes can still be made if the legislature misses the May 3 deadline. He said lawmakers can take matters into their own hands and pass bills that would make changes to the map-making process.
   
 "There's nothing stopping us from doing it," Butler said. "That's one of the things that I've always been amazed with. We talk a lot about the constitutional amendment. We don't talk about the fact that we can do this on our own. We don't need a constitutional amendment to implement a system that sets up fair maps."
   
 A constitutional amendment would be required, however, if lawmakers want to make the sweeping changes that 29 organizations are calling for -- an independent commission drawing maps and not legislators.
   
 The current structure of drawing maps is in the constitution, so an amendment is needed to fundamentally change that structure. Small changes, however, can be made legislatively -- like requiring more transparency, public hearings. But in the end, lawmakers would still have the final draw, and not an independent group.
   
 McMillan said CHANGE has been "so focused on the May 3 deadline" that it hasn't taken the time yet to look at possible legislative changes, but if the deadline passes, then they will shift to advocating for those changes.
   
 In that case, changes wouldn't likely come until next year's General Assembly because any bill proposals now would be wiped clean with the start of the new session.
   
 It is unclear when exactly legislators will meet privately to draw the new maps next year, but they will be finalized by fall 2021, in time for the 2022 elections.
   
 Lawmakers may be able to salvage some modifications to the process next spring, but it's becoming increasingly unlikely that an overhaul of the fundamental structure to congressional and legislative map drawing will have to wait another 10 years.

Israel's former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, who agreed Monday to form an emergency government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is widely seen as defined more by pragmatism and opposition to the right-wing premier than concrete policies.
 The 60-year-old has been in the public eye since first declaring political ambitions and running for office in December 2018.
 Within months, his centrist Blue and White party shocked Israeli politics by matching Netanyahu's right-wing Likud in polls last April and then edging slightly ahead of it in September.
 But neither party was able to gain the support of more than half the 120 MPs in the country's proportional system, forcing yet another election on March 2, the third within less than a year.
 After the vote, anti-Netanyahu forces, despite their deep divisions, unanimously rallied behind Gantz and recommended him to form a government.
 But when the anti-Netanyahu camp forced the ouster of parliament speaker Yuli Edelstein last month, Gantz put himself forward as a replacement in a surprise move and was elected speaker on March 26.
 In his first remarks after that election, Gantz called for an emergency unity government, saying "these are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions".
 Monday's deal will allow Netanyahu to stay in office for 18 months, with Gantz taking over for another 18 months before new elections.
 \- 'Benny-huta' -
 Gantz was born on June 9, 1959, in the southern village of Kfar Ahim, which his immigrant parents, both Holocaust survivors, helped establish.
 He joined the army in 1977 and went on to command Shaldag, an air force special operations unit.
 Standing well over six feet (1.82 metres) tall, he earned the military nickname "Benny-huta", a play on a word meaning "no rush" and reflecting his relaxed character.
 In 1994, he returned to the army to command a brigade and then a division in the occupied West Bank, before serving as Israel's military attaché to the United States from 2005 until 2009.
 He was the army's chief of staff from 2011 until his retirement in 2015, working closely with Netanyahu.
 In 2014, he commanded the army's operations in the war with Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas and has boasted of the number of Palestinian militants killed and targets destroyed.
 Blue and White is often hawkish on security and includes a number of Likud defectors in senior positions, but it lost several members after Gantz said he would seek a deal with Netanyahu.
 Through the latest campaign, Gantz sought to keep voter attention on the corruption charges against Netanyahu.
 \- 'In tandem' -
 Gantz has kept his positions vague in several key areas, including the moribund peace process with the Palestinians.
 Like Netanyahu, he was quick to endorse US President Donald Trump's controversial peace plan, viewed as overwhelmingly pro-Israeli and firmly rejected by the Palestinians.
 But while calling it a "historic milestone", he also seemed to hint at reservations.
 "Immediately after the elections, I will work toward implementing it from within a stable, functioning Israeli government, in tandem with the other countries in our region."
 Some saw the idea of "in tandem" with neighbouring Arab states and the Palestinians as a tactic to bury the plan indefinitely.
 But security hawk Gantz, like Netanyahu, has insisted the West Bank's strategic Jordan Valley must remain under Israeli control.
 As the COVID-19 epidemic intensified following the last election in March, calls mounted for Gantz and Netanyahu to unite and offer the country a rare period of political calm as it battles an unprecedented health crisis.
