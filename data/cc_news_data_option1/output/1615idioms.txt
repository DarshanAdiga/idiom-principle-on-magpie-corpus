Today marks launch day for the all-new and highly anticipated iPhone SE. Those needing a new smartphone have been holding out for something that wouldn't break the bank will want to check out a deal that Visible has going right now. At Visible, the normal price for the 64 GB Apple iPhone SE 2020 is $384. Currently, some versions of the device appear to be sold out, which is not uncommon on launch day for an Apple device.If you purchase the base version, it's currently available in white or red colors, and the $384 purchase price represents a slight $16 discount off the MSRP. The big savings comes in that when you purchase the phone and port number to Visible; you also get a $200 prepaid MasterCard. The prepaid card brings the total purchase price of the phone down to $184, which is a smoking deal.If you want more storage, the $200 prepaid MasterCard deal is good on the 128 GB and 256 GB smartphones as well. The catch is that the 128 GB model is sold out. However, the 256 GB version is available in white or red for $528. That means you can get the biggest 256 GB version for a bit less than the regular MSRP for the 64 GB smartphone after the card.The smartphone has a 4.7-inch Retina HD display and Touch ID. It is water-resistant to one meter for 30 minutes and uses the same A13 Bionic processor that the higher-end iPhone models use. The smartphone is good for up to 13 hours of video watching on a single charge. One caveat to this $200 prepaid MasterCard deal is that users do have to pay their first two months of service to qualify for the card. Presumably, that means the rebate will show up somewhere around the third month. A recent iPhone 12 leak suggests that the smartphone will stick with the Lightning charger.

The Dutch football federation (KNVB) called an end to the 2019-20 season on Friday, as the Eredivisie became the first top European league called off due to the coronavirus pandemic. No team will be declared champions after Ajax and AZ Alkmaar were left level on points at the top of the table with nine games still to play. "Unfortunately, given the measures (banning large-scale gatherings) taken by the government, it became impossible to finish the 2019-2020 season," the KNVB said in a statement.
 "Public health always comes first. This is not just a football problem given what the coronavirus is doing to society. Nonetheless, the professional football committee is aware that the decisions today are going to cause great disappointment for some," it added.
 Leaders Ajax, above AZ on goal difference, will qualify automatically for next season's Champions League group stage, according to the KNVB, which will await a definitive verdict from UEFA on May 25.
 AZ will likely enter the competition's qualifying rounds, with Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven and Willem II set to compete in the Europa League based on the final standings.
 The KNVB announced its intention to scrap the season on Tuesday following the Dutch government's decision to extend a ban on mass gatherings until September 1.
 Matches behind closed doors were said not to be an option as they are considered events which require a permit and police presence.
 The final decision was made following a meeting with the clubs on Friday. Next season will begin with the same 18 teams that started the aborted Eredivisie campaign.
 "There will be no relegation, nor promotion," said the KNVB, which is expected to face legal action from SC Cambuur and De Graafschap -- the top two clubs in the second division.
 The Belgian Pro League is expected to take a similar decision to that of their neighbours next week, with Club Brugge to be awarded the title.
 Football in Europe ground to a standstill in mid-March following the spread of the virus across the continent. However, Germany is preparing to resume the Bundesliga on May 9 behind closed doors, if the government gives the green light.
 Players in France could begin to return to training starting May 11, if lockdown restrictions are eased, while La Liga is also planning for clubs to resume training early next month.
 No potential restart dates have yet been announced for leagues in Italy or England.
