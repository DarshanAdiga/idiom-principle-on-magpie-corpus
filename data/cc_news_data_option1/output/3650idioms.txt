As Leary fought to regain the position, Stockon nipped Leary again at the line under the crossed flags indicating halfway to completion of the 30-lap feature. Nonetheless, Leary was undeterred, digging in to supplant Stockon from the top of the throne once again by a single car length at the line. That proved short lived as Stockon gained a big drive off the bottom of four to re- corral the race lead once and for all on the 17th circuit.

It was a fitting end. Before the event, Osaka was unsure of what the outcome of her amplifying police violence and anti-Black killings would be, yet her actions have challenged journalists to cover anti-Black racism in the same breath they cover her relatively unimportant matches. She has inadvertently held a mirror up to the sport itself, exposing cluelessness on racial issues even as a record 12 Black players populated the women’s singles draw. After her quarter-final win, an interviewer gleefully explained how she was guessing the name of the next (dead) person to appear on her mask every day. Later on in the week, her activism was pitted against Serena Williams as she asked to comment on why Williams, who once boycotted a tournament for 14 years due to racism, had not “made any statements or support of the movement.”

The body of a Bharatiya Janata Party worker was found hanging from a tree in West Bengal’s Hooghly district on Sunday, PTI reported.
 The police found the body of the man, identified as Ganesh Roy, in Khanati area near the district’s Goghat railway station. Unidentified police officials told the news agency that they were investigating the cause of his death.
 Roy’s family, meanwhile, alleged that he had been murdered by his political rivals. The BJP also blamed Trinamool Congress for its worker’s death. The party’s members blocked the Goghat-Arambagh Road as they staged a protest but were dispersed by the police.
 BJP’s state president Dilip Ghosh accused workers of the Mamata Banerjee-led party of leaving Roy’s body hanging to create panic in the area. “It has become a new trend to hang to death BJP workers,” he said. “We will launch a strong resistance. TMC [Trinamool Congress] is scared of the growing support for the BJP.”
 BJP MP Raju Bista accused the Trinamool Congress of turning Bengal into a “killing field”. “Another murder of a BJP worker by TMC goons, Ganesh Roy from Goghat, Arambagh,” he tweeted. “TMC has turned West Bengal into killing fields of opposition party workers and leaders. Democracy is getting mangled in broad daylight everyday.”
 The Trinamool Congress, on the other hand, denied the accusations. “No one from our party is involved in his death,” Trinamool Congress MLA Manas Majumdar said. “The truth will come out after investigation.”

 According to the letter, the KAS Rules 1979 did not provide for utilisation of leave and training reserve vacancies for making induction to the time scale in favour of those for whom slots were not available in their respective feeding departments.
 “Yet the induction of eligible officers was delayed despite availability of slots and 49 undeserving officers were inducted despite non-availability of slots,” it reads.
 J&K has formulated a seniority list of 138 KAS officers “as per the new tweaked rules”, which is likely to push many officers from the 1999 batch down.
 In another representation made to the GAD, an officer pointed out that the Committee constituted by the GAD in April had “envisaged to adopt a new set of principles for re-drawing the seniority list of the members”.
 ## “Bound to create new tensions”
 “This is bound to create new tensions, new disruption; and a logical consequence thereof would be generation of a new set of affected and disgruntled members,” the representation reads.
 Another principle laid down by a government committee has relied upon for determining the seniority the parameter of age. “Many shortcomings of this [age] parameters have been highlighted in our earlier representations...The solution has to be found in terms of the rules which are currently in vogue and in a manner which is just, fair and reasonable, both in letter and spirit,” it said.

 Two days back, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had asked IndiGo to take “appropriate action” after it found alleged violation of safety and social-distancing protocols by mediapersons in the airline’s Chandigarh-Mumbai flight that had actor Kangana Ranaut as a passenger.
 According to a video of the incident that took place inside the flight on September 9, reporters and cameramen were jostling and bunching up to get a comment from Ms. Ranaut, who was sitting in one of the front rows of the plane.
 The DGCA order on September 13 “clarified that a bona fide passenger travelling in an aircraft engaged in scheduled air transport services may do still and video photography from inside such an aircraft while in flight; take off and landing” as per its circular dated December 9, 2004. “However, this permission does not include use of any recording equipment which imperils or compromises air safety; violates prevalent norms; creates chaos or disruption during operation of flight or expressly prohibited by crew,” the order noted.
 Action may be initiated against those persons found in violation of above guidelines, the order added.
 The September 13 order is a clarification on top of the September 12 order that said, “It has been decided that from now on, incase any violation (photography) occurs on any scheduled passenger aircraft - the schedule of flight for that particular route shall be suspended for a period of two weeks from the next day (of the incident).”
 The September 12 order stated that as per Rule 13 of the Aircraft Rules 1937, no person is allowed to take any photographs inside a flight except when permission is granted by the DGCA or the Civil Aviation Ministry.
 As per the DGCA rules, an airline can put an “unruly passenger” on its “no-fly list” for a certain period of time after an internal enquiry.
 About the Chandigarh-Mumbai flight incident, a DGCA official said on September 11 that the prominent issues with the incident were related to “photography on board in violation of Aircraft rules 13, violation of COVID-19 protocols and certain actions falling within the purview of unruly behaviour on board”.
 The Shiv Sena, which heads the alliance government in the State, and Ms. Ranaut had engaged in a war of words after she likened Mumbai to Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK) and said she feared Mumbai Police more than the alleged movie mafia.
 On September 9 morning, a team of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished the alterations allegedly made without the civic body’s approval at Ms. Ranaut’s bungalow in Pali Hill in Mumbai.
 Ms. Ranaut arrived in Mumbai the same day after the demolition through the aforementioned IndiGo flight.
