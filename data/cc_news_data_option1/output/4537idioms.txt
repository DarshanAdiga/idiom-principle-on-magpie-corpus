DVB – It is imperative to zero in on a competent and honest astrologer because that his/her predicitons can mean the difference between life and death, success and failure for the client. There is no dearth of astrologers who start playing with the clients' horoscopes just after finishing their elementary studies in the subject. So, you need to refer to my answer to the first question to locate the right Astrologer for your needs. Here, I would like to borrow from our scriptures that ascribe the following words to Lord Vishnu – That person, who has had the experience of analyzing at least 50,000 horoscopes, can be termed a competent astrologer! So, you see, it requires a lot of hard work, perseverance, patience, and experience to be called a "Good Astrologer". You can also seek reasonable opinion from others about a particular astrologer, before consulting him. An astrologer, who can boast of sufficient third-party references, either through word-of-mouth or social media references, can be safe to consult, to say the least.

CATAWISSA — Winning a district championship is a big deal for most teams, and a celebration usually begins when the clock hits zero.
 Southern Columbia winning its sixth straight district title seemed to be a routine night for the Tigers — a lopsided win followed by a postgame message to get ready for next week.
 Southern Columbia defeated South Williamsport 49-14 on Friday night to win the District 4 Class 2A title.
 “I told the team they might not look at this as a big deal, but this is a district championship,” Southern Columbia coach Jim Roth said. “There was a time when there were big celebrations for winning the district title. Obviously, our goals are higher than that but it’s a stepping stone. We probably appreciate it more as coaches. These players haven’t experienced anything other than winning a district title.”
 No player on the Tigers’ roster has lost a high school football game. The win marked not only the Tigers’ 28th district title in the last 30 years, and their 57th consecutive win dating back to the beginning of the 2017 season.
 This one — like many of the previous 56 — was over early. Gavin Garcia scored four touchdowns on six carries in the first half, and finished with 168 yards as Southern Columbia (9-0) led 42-0 at halftime.
 South Williamsport picked up a first down after receiving the opening kickoff, and then went for it on a fourth-and-1 from their own 48. Zack Miller was stripped of the ball on the play, and Southern took over at its own 45. Two plays later, Garcia burst around the right side for a 40-yard touchdown.
 Southern took over near midfield on its next possession, and needed just two plays to make it 14-0 on Wes Barnes’ 55-yard touchdown run. Barnes burst through the middle and eluded several would-be tacklers on his way to the end zone.
 Nick Zeigler then picked off a long pass near midfield on the first play of South’s next drive. Garcia’s second touchdown of the night, this one from 4 yards, made it 21-0. A 37-yard screen pass to Barnes was the big pickup of the drive.
 The Tigers turned it over on their next drive at the end of the first quarter, but responded with three more touchdowns in the second quarter to take a 42-0 halftime lead. Garcia touchdown runs of 26 and 76 yards sandwiched around a Braeden Wisloski 1-yard touchdown run. Wisloski’s score followed a blocked punt by Derek Berlitz.
 While Garcia and the Tigers were running all over South’s defense to the tune of 274 first-half rushing yards, Southern’s defense was once again giving its opponent fits. After South’s initial first down on its first drive, the Mounties only managed one more first down the remainder of the half, and that came after they already trailed 35-0. The Tigers held them to just 48 total yards in the first half.
 “Southern Columbia has one of the greatest programs in the country, but I’m just so proud of our team and what we did to get back here (to the district title game), especially with everything we’ve had to deal with this year with COVID and missing scrimmages and games,” said South Williamsport coach Chris Eiswerth.
 Southern added one more touchdown to its point total on its first drive of the second half as Barnes capped a 122-yard night with his second touchdown of the evening.
 “He’s a really good player. He’s got that combination like Gavin with size and speed. Probably doesn’t use the moves quite as much as Gavin, but he will change direction and has good acceleration and quickness and he runs hard and breaks tackles,” said Roth. “He had a strong game, and that’s a key because our passing game has been kind of hit-or-miss. Barnes makes it hard for teams to just line up and key on Gavin.”
 South Williamsport later scored a pair of touchdowns on two Miller touchdown runs in the fourth quarter.
 With the win, the Tigers advance to the state quarterfinals next week, where they will face District 6 champion Richland for the second straight year in the state tournament. Last year, Southern defeated Richland in the state semifinals en route to their third straight state title.

You may be wondering why the Space Telescope Science Institute is using Hubble as opposed to a telescope located here on Earth. The simple answer is that Hubble is located above the Earth's atmosphere, where it is exposed to the Ultraviolet light of nearby stars. Here on Earth, telescopes cannot observe that same Ultraviolet light due to the atmosphere filtering most of it out.

A family of good Samaritans prepares and sells variety rice for ₹5 a serving in the city, to help labourers and students.
 C. Pushparani can be seen serving variety rice to her customers in Khajamalai Colony, near the Government Law College campus. A signboard says the plate of rice costs just ₹5. While serving, Ms Pushparani likes to ask her customers about their day, whether they work or if they are studying and if they are taking care of their health. “Many of them are so busy with their work that they forget to eat, forget to take care of themselves,” she says. The initiative to serve food was her husband R Chandrashekhar’s, she notes.
 Mr. Chandrashekhar works as a welder, and says he understood the struggle for food during the COVID-19 lockdown period. He was on-duty welding at a site when the lockdown was announced, and was unable to get a bus home, or buy a meal. “I walked for an entire day to reach home and there was no food available anywhere. I decided on that day that I would serve food for anyone and everyone,” he says.
 With the support of his wife and his eldest son, he set up the affordable food stall in Khajamalai near the Anna Stadium in September. “We did not want to distribute for free but also did not want to price the food too high,” Ms. Pushparani, who handles the stall says.
 The menu includes sambar rice, lemon rice, pudina rice, tamarind rice, tomato rice, brinjal rice and curd rice. “We serve five varieties of rice a day. While the curd rice and sambar rice are available daily, the other varieties are made on a rotational basis,” Ms. Pushparani said. Food is served at lunch time from Monday to Saturday.
 Ms. Pushparani begins cooking at 6 a.m., before which the vegetables are chopped and the masalas are ground to a paste. By 10 a.m., the food is prepared and ready to serve. “We set up our stall by 11.30 a.m. and by 2 p.m., we run out of all varieties,” she says.
 The food is not served to earn a profit but as a service to society, says Mr. Chandrashekhar. “We are also struggling to earn money but when one’s stomach is filled, one can take on the world,” says Ms Pushparani.
 Groceries used to prepare the food are purchased in bulk using the daily earnings. Shop-owners, wholesale vegetable vendors and grocery stores reduce the price when Ms. Pushparani goes to purchase. This is their way of contributing to our cause, she said.
 On Friday, two more stalls, one outside the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital and another at the Palpannai junction were set up. “We want to reach as many people as possible. Nobody should go to work or to sleep on an empty stomach,” Ms Pushparani says.

NEW YORK (AP) — Weatherman and morning TV co-host Al Roker has revealed that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer and will be undergoing surgery to have his prostate removed.“It’s a good news-bad news kind of thing,” Roker said Friday on NBC’s “Today.” “Good news is we caught it early. Not great news is that it’s a little aggressive, so I’m going to be taking some time off to take care of this.”Roker revealed he got the diagnosis Sept. 29. It began with a routine physical when his doctor discovered he had an elevated prostate-specific antigen in his bloodwork. That led to him getting an MRI, followed by a biopsy, to confirm his diagnosis.The 66-year-old TV personality urged others at risk — particularly Black men — to ensure they see a doctor and get the proper checkups to stop a cancer that is very treatable if detected early.“The problem for African Americans is that any number of reasons from genetics to access to health care, and so we want to make it available and let people know they got to get checked,” Roker said.Roker, a father of three, was by himself when he received the diagnosis. That made his wife, ABC News correspondent Deborah Roberts, upset. “I feel badly, because I didn’t tell Deborah to come with me,” he said. “In hindsight, boy I wish I’d told her to come.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
