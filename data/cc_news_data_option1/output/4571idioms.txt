Milano, 9 nov. (Adnkronos) - Il Comune di Milano ha notificato a tre operatori di monopattini elettrici in condivisione la revoca dell'autorizzazione a effettuare attività sul territorio di Milano. Lo comunica Palazzo Marino. Dall'inizio della sperimentazione dello sharing di monopattini, il Comune ha avviato un monitoraggio dei veicoli messi a disposizione dei cittadini e del rispetto delle regole definite nell'avviso pubblico. A fronte di diverse rilevazioni di irregolarità a carico degli operatori e di reiterazione di comportamenti non conformi alle regole definite negli avvisi pubblici, si spiega, si è reso necessario arrivare la revoca che impone ai tre operatori la cessazione delle attività e il ritiro dei veicoli entro metà novembre. In particolare sono state riscontrate anomalie sul sistema di moderazione della velocità e della sosta.
 "I monopattini consentono spostamenti agili e capillari, si integrano con la rete del trasporto pubblico e rappresentano un sistema innovativo e sostenibile -si sottolinea dal Comune- ma gli elementi a favore della sperimentazione attuata dal Comune di Milano non prescindono dalla sicurezza del mezzo e dall'utilizzo regolare del veicolo".

A talent drain in the ACC, transfers and a pandemic. All bets are off this hoops season


--DocBreak--
WILMINGTON, Del. — President-elect Joe Biden signaled on Sunday he plans to move quickly to build out his government, focusing first on the raging pandemic that will likely dominate the early days of his administration.
 Biden named a former surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, and a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, David Kessler, as co-chairs of a coronavirus working group set to get started, with other members expected to be announced today.
 Transition team officials said that also this week Biden will launch his agency review teams, the group of transition staffers that have access to key agencies in the current administration to ease the transfer of power. The teams will collect and review information such as budgetary and staffing decisions, pending regulations and other work in progress from current staff at the departments to help Biden’s team prepare to transition. White House officials would not comment on whether they would cooperate with Biden’s team on the review.
 “People want the country to move forward,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden deputy campaign manager, in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press, and see Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris “have the opportunity to do the work, to get the virus under control and to get our economy back together.”
 It’s unclear for now whether President Donald Trump and his administration will cooperate. He has yet to acknowledge Biden’s victory and has pledged to mount legal challenges in several closely contested states that decided the race.
 Biden adviser Jen Psaki pressed for the Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration to quickly recognize Biden as the president-elect, which would free up money for the transition and clear the way for Biden’s team to begin putting in place the transition process at agencies.
 “America’s national security and economic interests depend on the federal government signaling clearly and swiftly that the United States government will respect the will of the American people and engage in a smooth and peaceful transfer of power,” Psaki said in a Twitter posting.
 A GSA official said Sunday that step had not been taken yet.
 A bipartisan group of administration officials from the Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton administrations on Sunday called on the Trump administration to move forward “to immediately begin the post-election transition process.”
 “This was a hard-fought campaign, but history is replete with examples of presidents who emerged from such campaigns to graciously assist their successors,” members of the Center for Presidential Transition advisory board said in a statement.
 The statement was signed by Bush White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt as well as Bill Clinton- era chief of staff Thomas “Mack” McLarty and Obama Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.
 Biden aides said the president-elect and transition team had been in touch with Republican lawmakers. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest allies, opened a Cabinet meeting on Sunday by congratulating Biden, a former vice president and longtime senator.
 “I have a long and warm personal connection with Joe Biden for nearly 40 years, and I know him as a great friend of the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said. “I am certain that we will continue to work with both of them in order to further strengthen the special alliance between Israel and the U.S.”
 George W. Bush, the sole living Republican former president, also wished Biden well.
 “Though we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country,” Bush said.
 Biden faces key staffing decisions in the days ahead. The always-frenzied 10-week transition period before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 already has been shortened by the extra time it took to determine the winner of Tuesday’s election.
 The second Catholic to be elected president, Biden started his first full day as president-elect by attending church at St. Joseph on the Brandywine near his home in Wilmington, as he does nearly every week. After the service, he visited the church cemetery where several family members have been laid to rest, including his late son, Beau.
 Beau Biden, a former Delaware attorney general, died in 2015 from cancer. Before his death, he had encouraged his father to make a third run for the White House.
 Joe Biden said Saturday in a victory speech that he would announce a task force of scientists and experts today to develop a “blueprint” to begin beating back the virus by the time he assumes the presidency. He said his plan would be “built on bedrock science” and “constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern.”
 Murthy, who had advised Biden during the campaign, was named to a four-year term as surgeon general in 2014 by President Barack Obama. Murthy was asked to resign by Trump months into the Republican’s term. Kessler was appointed as FDA commissioner by President George H.W. Bush and served in the position through President Bill Clinton’s first term in the White House.
 Biden senior adviser Ted Kaufman said the transition team will focus on the “nuts and bolts” of building the new administration in coming days.
 Biden may not make top Cabinet choices for weeks. But he built his presidential run around bipartisanship and he has spent the days since Tuesday’s election pledging to be a president for all Americans. That suggests he could be willing to appoint some Republicans to high-profile administration positions.
 Many former Republican officeholders broke with Trump to endorse Biden’s campaign. Biden’s selection of some of them to join the new government could appease Senate Republicans, who may have to confirm many of Biden’s choices for top jobs. The GOP could retain control of the chamber after two special elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.
 Still, too much across-the-aisle cooperation could draw the ire of progressives. Some already worry that uncooperative Senate Republicans could force Biden to scale back his ambitious campaign promises to expand access to health care and lead a post-pandemic economic recovery that relies on federal investment in green technology and jobs to help combat climate change.
 “I think there will be a huge misuse of the word ‘unity’ to imply that we need to water down the ideas that Joe Biden just campaigned on,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. He said the country was more united around bold solutions to big problems than small-scale efforts.
 Biden’s efforts at bipartisan reconciliation could still be derailed by Trump’s refusing to concede the race.
 Symone Sanders, a Biden campaign senior adviser, said that while several Republican lawmakers have been in contact with the president-elect in recent days, the campaign has yet to hear from White House officials.
 “I think the White House has made clear what their strategy is here and that they are going to continue to participate and push forward these flailing and, in many — in many respects, baseless legal strategies,” Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
 Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said Trump had a right to pursue recounts and legal challenges. But he noted that those efforts will unlikely change the outcome and he urged the president to dial back his rhetoric.
 “I think one has to be careful in the choice of words. I think when you say the election was corrupt or stolen or rigged that that’s unfortunately rhetoric that gets picked up by authoritarians around the world. And I think it also discourages confidence in our democratic process here at home,” Romney said on NBC.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many business owners to scramble for new ways to keep themselves afloat.
 Mood Food Events was launched in August 2019, just a few months before the coronavirus hit, and owner Melissa Peralta found herself having to come up with a whole new game plan.
 "Mood Food Events was an event-based business focused on creating carefully curated in-person wellness experiences designed to help create more positive associations with healthy habits," said Peralta, a Scituate resident.
 After it became apparent that the temporary restrictions due to the pandemic, including social distancing mandates, would become a part of our "new normal," Peralta said the business shifted its focus to projects that had been placed on the back burner. This included launching a blog, and establishing an online Mood Food Marketplace and monthly subscription boxes featuring all natural products made without dairy, gluten or refined sugar.
 "We needed to adapt our business model to accommodate the new needs of our community, which ultimately led to our pivot from Mood Food Events to Mood Food Wellness Co.," she said.
 Peralta and her team have made a major effort to bring the carefully curated experiences that were created at the in-person events to an online community.
 "This will help people at home realize how easy it is to integrate healthier choices into their everyday life," she said.
 A focus has been on partnering with local brands like The Hale Bone Broth, Duxbury Saltworks, New England Rock Moss, AMG Snacks, Uprise Foods and Ms. Fresh Organics to make their wholesome local products available for purchase in The Mood Food Marketplace, Peralta said.
 "Once those local partnerships were in place, I began reaching out to small brands from throughout the country that are producing clean food, wellness and lifestyle products aligned with the Mood Food mission. I spend hours researching all of the products and ingredients to ensure they are of the highest quality and made with the cleanest ingredients possible. I love having this platform to share my discoveries with the community."
 Different ways to healthy living
 The blog shares easy seasonal recipes, and also explains how followers can create their own Mood Food events at home.
 "This month we will be sharing a blog feature on how to recreate our dairy, gluten and refined sugar-free Thanksgiving feast at home with all natural products from #moodfoodapproved vendors and a variety of local vendors," Peralta said.
 The monthly subscription boxes offer two options for subscribers to discover new products from #moodfoodapproved brands and receive different full size products from The Mood Food Marketplace each month.
 "This winter we will also be launching The Mood Food Apothecary which will feature a handcrafted line of all natural herb and root powders, and related content about herbal remedies and the benefits of plant medicine," Peralta said.
 She has also launched a new community initiative "Nourish Your Neighbors" to help bring health conscious foods to the food pantries in an effort to meet increased demand for specialty food items for people with medical conditions and dietary restrictions.
 "I really thrive on being forced to adapt, and have really loved the freedom that the pandemic has created to try new things without fear of failure," Peralta said. "The way so many small businesses and members of the community have banded together to support each other through this difficult time has been so uplifting and such a source of inspiration for me."
 Additionally, Peralta also owns a custom catering, private chef, bespoke event and concierge coordination company, Suddenly Simple Events, and brings all of her expertise in those areas to creating custom Mood Food wellness experiences and events for clients in the safety, comfort and convenience of their own home.
 "We offer meal prep, farm-to-table food shopping, clean ingredient sourcing, dinner parties, micro events and in-home retreats," she said. "We are available for private bookings of all kinds."
 Mood Food is not a program or diet plan, Peralta points out.
 "We simply believe that once you experience the food and mindset at our events, you'll discover that you can still enjoy all of the things you love without having to experience the negative physical effects associated with popular indulgences, and will organically want to integrate more wellness focused experiences, content and consumables into your everyday life. I have definitely noticed an increased public interest in health and wellness and more requests for kid friendly recipes too."

A spokesman for Germany’s Interior Minister said Monday that police in Leipzig had decided to pursue a strategy of “de-escalation” in light of the size and composition of the protest.

And finally, our business is also underpinned by very high-quality products in strong demand and growing customer support and training activities, adding further resilience. We have a leadership position in key market segments like helicopters, with very good products and resilient customer support and training business. For example, despite a 50% slowdown in civil activity, we are seeing only 15% slowdown in civil customer support because our helicopter fleets are flying and are used by our clients, both in civil and military fields. Our continued technological innovation, leveraging our core competence is driving new business opportunities. And all of this is giving us resiliency and competitive advantage across the board. So COVID-19 is just a slowdown of the speed and timing of our growth plans, but we are fully confident in our fundamentals and our strengths as it makes us very well positioned for the medium, long term.

Andrew, I think it's a very good question, and I don't want to pretend that, I can forecast the dollar rates. It's hard and we have seen this huge volatility. Hopefully, the biggest volatility we have witnessed from Q3 to Q4 moving from $1.10 average to $1.17. Now, there is some U.S. I would say, vola post the election. It was a debate internally. But instead of going now to $1.175, we said we do either $1.15 or $1.20. We decided to go to $1.15. And you are right the rule of thumb is €14 now per $0.01 on the revenue side and $0.04 on the profitability side.

It has not yet achieved the objective of providing an even spread of education to its people – the hills remain deprived in many ways – but the overall quality of schools is good.

The prospect of some kind of hope for the future feels good, but the markets have been optimistic since it first began to look like Joe Biden would win the White House last week. Pfizer’s positive outlook for its vaccine is likely just feeding into that overall feeling of greater stability — there’s still a long way to go. A peer-review of the data from the Pfizer vaccine trial has not been published yet, but scientists told the New York Times that the initial data is encouraging and exceeded their expectations of effectiveness.

So we've been doing it kind of slow for now. But so far, the response has been good. I mean, we saw a good response when we switched our fuel tanks to a different brand. So replacement isn't really a brand, right? It's just what we decided to call the product years ago. And so when we switch it to a brand, we do see an uptick, but we have a long way to go to build awareness for all of these brands and to translate to the consumer what it actually means when they buy these branded products. So we have things like warranty, and we'll be offering other things to stand behind the product. But we do have to build awareness for all of our brands.

And when you take a step back, this category likely would have existed last year at this time, had not every LP been short on supply. Every CPG category that I’m familiar with has a value hierarchy, and we think that the value category is here to stay. Big question will be what’s going to happen with value category pricing over time? I’m of the opinion that it will continue to move around, but over time, it’s going to start to tighten up. But, time will tell on that. The key is making sure that we’ve got the right production strategy behind each tier of product, which ties into my earlier remarks, which is making sure that every one of our facilities is purpose-driven to make sure that we’re growing the right product for the right category out of the right facility and hitting the right cost. So, we believe, even at the price points that you see in the market, we can hit our margin targets with Twd being a third of our business over time.

Milano, 9 nov. (Adnkronos) - Il Comune di Milano ha notificato a tre operatori di monopattini elettrici in condivisione la revoca dell'autorizzazione a effettuare attività sul territorio di Milano. Lo comunica Palazzo Marino. Dall'inizio della sperimentazione dello sharing di monopattini, il Comune ha avviato un monitoraggio dei veicoli messi a disposizione dei cittadini e del rispetto delle regole definite nell'avviso pubblico. A fronte di diverse rilevazioni di irregolarità a carico degli operatori e di reiterazione di comportamenti non conformi alle regole definite negli avvisi pubblici, si spiega, si è reso necessario arrivare la revoca che impone ai tre operatori la cessazione delle attività e il ritiro dei veicoli entro metà novembre. In particolare sono state riscontrate anomalie sul sistema di moderazione della velocità e della sosta. "I monopattini consentono spostamenti agili e capillari, si integrano con la rete del trasporto pubblico e rappresentano un sistema innovativo e sostenibile -si sottolinea dal Comune- ma gli elementi a favore della sperimentazione attuata dal Comune di Milano non prescindono dalla sicurezza del mezzo e dall'utilizzo regolare del veicolo".
