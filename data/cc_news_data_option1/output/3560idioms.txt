Like the professor warned, the public will turn on a dime if the protests aren't peaceful, especially if the Dems don't speak up soon and silly co- opters like that group. There's worse ones out there aren't even anti- colonialists, just taking advantage of the ability to vandalize public property for the hell of it or because they have some grudge against a celebrity depicted. It's way outta control. Every night there's one. They've got to start going through proper channels if they really care (like with the TR statue) and stop the random vandalism and calling the media to come see their performance....

Tokyo, Sept 8 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 8th Sep, 2020 ) :Yoshihide Suga, the man expected to become Japan's next prime minister, is a farmer's son with a reputation for inscrutability, who has become a key government adviser, spokesman and policy enforcer.
 The 71-year-old is widely expected to win the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race, which kicked off Tuesday, and be endorsed by parliament to replace outgoing premier Shinzo Abe.
 If he succeeds, the election will cap a career that has seen Suga serve in key political roles, including most recently as chief cabinet secretary -- an office that involves coordinating policy and bringing government agencies and the bureaucracy to heel.
 He has also effectively been the face of Abe's government, serving as its top spokesman and defending decisions in daily press conferences, including in sometimes testy exchanges with reporters.
 While the role has in the past been a stepping stone to the prime minister's office, Suga had regularly said he was not interested in the top job.
 But not long after Abe announced in late August that he would resign over health issues, Suga emerged as the leading choice to succeed him, with key LDP factions throwing their support behind him.
 Suga has earned a reputation for wielding his power to control Japan's sprawling and powerful bureaucracy and help push through government policies.
 As a government spokesman, he has not often given much insight into his personal ideology, though he has championed some initiatives, including a special taxation scheme, seen as important for revitalising rural areas.
 Unlike many in the conservative LDP, Suga is not a political blue blood, and grew up the son of a strawberry farmer in rural Akita, in northern Japan.
 He moved to Tokyo after high school and worked odd jobs to put himself through night college, before being elected to his first office in 1987, as a municipal assembly member in Yokohama outside Tokyo.

It’s a lot of hard work that he’s putting in behind the scenes when nobody’s really paying attention.”

The state as a whole is just not liberal! Just not a world that fits in any shape or form. They like their Democrats sensible, down to earth, not liberal, Reagan Dem style though not as hard and fast as Michigan. Joe does fit the bill I've got to say. Plenty of them voted for Obama both times, another sensible, not liberal type of guy. The "no drama" thing a big plus as well I would imagine. (Obama's grandparents that helped raise him were actually sounded like Wisconsin type people).

Paris views itself as "an honest broker" to do this in a time when tensions are at a peak between Washington and Tehran.
 Observers say France is one of the only Western powers to have maintained direct contact with Hezbollah, pointing to the role of the current French ambassador, who formerly held the same post in Tehran.
 "There has always been direct contact between Paris and Hezbollah," an Arab diplomat in Beirut told AFP.
 And as Washington is caught up in preparing for the US presidential polls, it appears to be giving France some leeway on Lebanon.
 "The Americans have set as a condition that Hezbollah not take part in the (next) government, but they could turn a blind eye to them remaining if there were a deal and reforms," the diplomat said.
 \- Hezbollah 'cannot be trusted' - US Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker, also visiting Lebanon last week, told Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar that the US appreciated the French initiative, but differed on a few details, including that Hezbollah was not a legitimate political organisation but a "terrorist" group.
 He did not meet with key political figures, instead seeing army chief Joseph Aoun, lawmakers who resigned after the port blast, civil society activists and Shiite figures opposed to Hezbollah.
 One such Shiite figure told AFP that Schenker said during their meeting that Hezbollah "cannot be trusted" to lead reforms.
 "Hezbollah has been given ample opportunity since 2005 to really involve itself in the state and has not changed its behaviour," the source reported Schenker as saying.
 The United States has demanded Hezbollah lay down its weapons, but also echoed the call of a political minority in Lebanon that the country be "neutral", meaning that it break ties with Iran and distance itself from the region's conflicts.
 Most Lebanese political sides, however, have accepted that the Shiite movement is a military force to contend with and a political actor present in all branches of state, which, with its allies, currently dominates parliament.
 Responding to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling for Hezbollah's weapons to be dealt with as a priority, Druze leader Walid Jumblatt in a televised interview last week responded that the solution would come through politics.
 "Let Pompeo forget the rockets for now. That matter will be solved through politics when the time is right," he said.

Pole-sitter Stephen Donahue got the jump to regain the lead, forcing Therrien to sit back for a bit. On lap 56, Therrien snatched the lead back from Donahue, with defending Thunder Road champion Jason Corliss in hot pursuit. Corliss slipped underneath Donahue to take over the second spot just before the fourth and fifth yellow flags on lap 68.
 Following a tangle involving Dylan Payea and Chip Grenier on the restart, Corliss outgunned Therrien to take the lead. As the race neared the halfway point, Barre’s Nick Sweet made it a three-car tango at the front by slicing through slower traffic.
 After the 10th and final caution flew on lap 140 for debris, Therrien decided it was time to make a move. He got the jump on Corliss, his 2020 Thunder Road championship rival, and continued to ride the outside after taking the lead. Therrien got faster as the race progressed, running some his best laps at the end.
 Sweet passed Corliss to take over second place on lap 161. Even though Sweet made a big push to take over the top spot in traffic, Therrien was too much to handle. Therrien put all but six other drivers a lap down as he locked up his second win of the season at the Barre track.
 Corliss wound up third and maintained his Thunder Road points lead with one event remaining. Scott Dragon placed fourth, while Graniteville’s Christopher Pelkey recorded his career-best ACT effort in fifth.

 Therrien secured the top spot for good from Barre’s Jason Corliss on a lap-140 restart and stormed into the sunset for the victory. The Hinesburg driver captured his fourth ACT victory and has also prevailed four times at Thunder Road during his career.
 Therrien started sixth for the 200-lap endurance test and put on a charge early. The 2018 Thunder Road Lade Model champ moved around Matt White into the runner-up spot on lap 22 and went to work.
