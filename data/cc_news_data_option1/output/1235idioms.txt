As I write this in late March of 2020, the world is under attack from a deadly strain of coronavirus called COVID-19. Thus far, there have been around 18,000 deaths world-wide, including 550 deaths in the United States where I live. My country has come to a halt: schools and businesses are shut down and people have been warned to stay in their houses or apartments hunkered down in the face of this menacing enemy. We’re in a war, that’s how it is being described in the media. The president has said he is like a war-time president.

When a Zambian couple that travelled to France were reported as the first officially tested victims of the Corona Virus in the country, the Zambian social media machinery went full throttle to insult them, instead of taking a compassionate stance for the couples’ situation. The couples’ pictures were uncontrollably shared all over social media by many Zambians that took it so personal, without considering the trauma the couple were going through. Of course, a lot would argue that the couple were irresponsible to have travelled abroad during this period. Nevertheless, in critical situations like this, how one contracted the disease is immaterial, but how the disease could be contained, and how the victim could come out of danger as quickly as possible without endangering others matters most.

Politicians love to promise to clean house in Washington. For a change Friday, they followed through when the actual U.S. House of Representatives confronted the coronavirus outbreak with the biggest stimulus bill in history. The vigilance fit the perilous moment for humanity, as well as the specific threat to people over 60 who control the nation's legislature.

The California Horse Racing Board told the track it must operate under the sanction of local health authorities. Gov. Gavin Newsom had already issued a statewide stay-at-home order, resulting in businesses shutting down or dramatically scaling back to protect against the spread of the virus.

Each individual flower has a pistil, the long three-lobed pollen receptor and a cluster of stamens, shorter than the pistol that are the pollen bearers. These reproductive parts are in the center of each amaryllis flower. The stamens, the pollinators, will mature before the pistil is ready to be fertilized.
 While the stamen are heavy with pollen, the pistil will be turned downward, after a few days the pistil turns upward and the tip opens up and separates into a three-lobed pollen receptor.
 To pollinate the pistil, rub pollen bearing stamen you have pinched or cut off of another plant on the three-lobed receptor, transferring pollen on to the sticky lobes. You have just pollinated the flower and started the process of seed forming.
 Do not pollinate every flower on the scape, producing seed is hard work and you do not want to deplete your bulbs. Pollinate two out of each four flowers on the scape. The seeds will begin to form and in the next few weeks will grow into a walnut-sized pod.
 The pod will be green as the seeds grow and mature inside it. When the pod becomes ripe it will turn a beige color and a small slit will open at the top of the pod to assist the seed in drying. When the split appears in the beige pod, you can pinch the stem to the pod off. Pinch the stem off as close to the scape as possible.
 After gathering the seed pods, place them in a dish or bowl inside for a few days, allowing them to finish drying. After the pod splits open, you can rub the seeds and they will fall out and the pod can be thrown away. The seed are flat, black and very silky feeling, about the size of a dime. Unlike many other seed, amaryllis seed cannot be held long before planting, the sooner you plant them the higher the germination rate will be.
 Plant the seeds where they will not have to compete with other plants. Chop up your patch of dirt and scatter the seed over the surface, sprinkle more soil to partially cover them and gently water well. Do not let the germinating seed dry out for even one day or it will die.
 This is a very simple process; when you have done it a few times, you can tell from looking at the amaryllis from several feet away if they are ready to be pollinated. Pinching stamen off the pollen donor and dusting the pistil with pollen takes less than one minute. To prevent insect pollination, it is best to do this in the morning.
 I plant my seed in flats lined with newspaper and filled with potting soil these have to be kept watered almost daily, but they can stay in the shade until after the little green sprouts of foliage come up.
 The foliage will look like grass coming up and after about two months a small bulb will have begun to form. Leave the small amaryllis plants where they were planted for at least one year or possibly two years, at that time they can be placed in containers or transplanted into your garden if they are not smothered out by larger plants.
 With good sunlight and proper feeding, you will have flowers from the seeds within about five years. I have a flat of seeds that are about four years old and this spring two of the bulbs have run up scapes and are about to bloom. I look forward to seeing what they will be.
 Out of space, see you next week.

Pritzker originally ordered schools closed through March but extended the order through at least April 7 as the state tried to get a handle on the pandemic by issuing a stay-at-home order through the same day. Chicago Public Schools suspended in-person classes at least through April 20.

Airtel was in the dock some time ago for opening payment bank accounts for its customers without their say-so. Utilise this technological capability. Ask every phone operator, whether it already has a banking licence or not, to open bank accounts for every customer. Identify the poor from their average revenue per user. Prioritise the owners of phones that have moved across state boundaries. Transfer money to these accounts. Be liberal, say Rs. 2,000 to begin with, with a message to share the resources with their cohorts without a phone or with phones that have not been recharged.

There could have to be further revisions to the revised budget Kemp signed for the current year, which cut $159 million amid already slowing revenues. That spending plan took $100 million out of Georgia's $2.8 billion savings account, but England and Hill said revenue may fall short again.

Londoners defied Hitler’s bomb raids by attending the theatre. Picasso found the powerful statement of “Guernica” in the horrors of war. John Steinbeck’s travels during the Great Depression inspired “The Grapes of Wrath.”
 Vincent Van Gogh’s colorful paintings defy the suffering of his life.
 In mankind’s distant past, when our ancestors possessed little hold on the earth, humans hunted and battled by day then sung songs and painted figures on cave walls by night.
 Some may be tempted to sound the old Roman phrase of bread and circuses regarding the arts in times of uncertainty.
 Instead, we should view our area’s art events as wellsprings of hope, faith and perseverance, as a sign of mankind’s indomitable will to make sense of madness.
 In times of trouble, in times of chaos, we need the arts more than ever. The arts offer a balm to the troubled, an inspiration to overcome disasters and order in the midst of fear and illness and potential ruin.
 Humans can transcend their circumstances through the arts. May the arts continue to express and transcend and persevere as certainly as we will in the days and weeks to come.

Interestingly, Syria finds itself on the same page as the UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Russia in opposing the Turkish intervention in Libya as well. Recently, the Libyan warlord General Khalifa Haftar’s faction (which opposes the Turkey-backed government in Tripoli) was allowed to take over the Libyan embassy in Damascus.
