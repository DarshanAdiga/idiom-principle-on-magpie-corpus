A HUGE BOUQUET OF roses to the local Salvation Army for requiring masks be worn by everyone shopping in their thrift stores, except those people showing their medical exemption letters. In the days leading up to this, the S.A. reminded all its customers verbally and through signage what was coming before rigidly enforcing it. I was especially impressed with how one of the Sally Ann cashiers at the Kilpatrick Avenue store handled a customer who came into the store without wearing one. She reminded her about the rule and then handed her a disposable mask so she wouldn't have to leave. See, it is possible to be kind and protect the public at the same time. Hopefully all other local businesses will follow suit and actually enforce their mask-wearing regulations.

The first national color show (the 1954 Rose Parade tournament) in the United States took place on January 1, 1954. For the next ten years, most network broadcasts and almost all local broadcasts continued to be broadcast in black and white. A color transition was announced for autumn 1965, in which more than half of all network prime time programs were broadcast in color. The first all-color peak season came just a year later. In 19402, the last holdout of daytime network shows was converted to the first full color network season.

FAYETTEVILLE Since senior running back Rakeem Boyd missed Arkansas' most recent game on Nov. 21 versus LSU among the many Razorbacks held out because of positive COVID-19 tests and contact tracing, Arkansas Coach Sam Pittman implied his absence changes nothing for Arkansas' next game Saturday at Missouri.
   
 Having to postpone last Saturday's game vs. Missouri because positive COVID-19 tests and contact tracing quarantines plus football related injuries put the Razorbacks under the SEC healthy roster protocol, Arkansas, 3-5, and Mizzou, 4-3, kick off at 11 a.m. Saturday on the SEC Network at Faurot Field in Columbia, Mo.
   
 The Razorbacks do so without Boyd, Preseason All-SEC for amassing 1,133 rushing yards in 2019 despite former Arkansas Coach Chad Morris' Hogs wallowing 2-10 overall/0-8 in the SEC, now opting out for the season's remainder after missing two of Arkansas' eight games (one for injury and one apparently because of covid) to concentrate on preparing for the 2021 spring NFL draft.
   
 "Well, the tailback situation looks exactly like it did last game against LSU, with adding Dominique Johnson ( the freshman running back withheld last week). Pittman said on Wednesday's SEC Coaches/Media teleconference. "So, Trelon Smith will be our starting tailback and you have TJ Hammonds and you have Dominque and you have (Donte) Buckner."
   
 Asked Wednesday his thoughts about Boyd opting out, Pittman replied, "The thoughts on Rakeem, he opted out, so opting out means that you're concerned about the covid virus and because of those concerns he opted out."
   
 Smith, the sophomore redshirted at Arkansas in 2019 after transferring as a 2018 freshman letterman at Arizona State, has been Boyd's backup for six games and started the two that Boyd missed. Though previously considered the backup, Smith leads the 2020 Razorbacks in rushing, 89 carries for 469 yards and two touchdowns, and behind wideouts Treylon Burks and Mike Woods is Arkansas' third-leading receiver, 20 catches for 134 yards and a touchdown.
   
 Senior Hammonds of Little Rock Joe T. Robinson, opened the season as a spare running back/ receiver now operating full time at running back. He popped a 29-yard run in his lone carry in the 27-24 loss to LSU in Fayetteville.
   
 Johnson, 6-1 240 on scholarship from Crowley, Texas, has logged no 2020 stats.
   
 Nor has Buckner, a freshman walk-on from White Hall.
   
 Though not practicing the Razorbacks beyond walkthroughs last week theorizing "If you don't have enough to play you probably don't have enough to practice," Pittman and his staff did get an extra week of prepping for Missouri.
   
 In contrast the Tigers of first-year Mizzou coach and Alma native Eli Drinkwitz, played their earlier postponed by covid game against the Vanderbilt Commodores. They vanquished Vandy, 41-0 in Columbia.
   
 Barry Odom, Arkansas' first-year defensive coordinator, was Missouri's head coach from 2016-2019. He bequeathed Drinkwitz a stout defense which Pittman knows well having coached Georgia's offensive line from 2015-2019 in the Bulldogs' annual SEC clash vs. Mizzou, the lone SEC East team that SEC West member Arkansas plays annually.
   
 "You go on the defense, they've got some guys now over there on the D-line," Pittman said. "You know I was at Georgia and had the opportunity to play Missouri every year, and they always give you fits on the defensive line. And of course Nick Bolton, in my opinion, is as good a linebacker as there is in the SEC. So they're hot right now and they're very well coached by Coach Drinkwitz and his staff."
   
 Drinkwitz, whose staff includes former Greenwood state high school champion coach Rick Jones as an analyst, was asked on Wednesday's SEC teleconference to compare Butkus Award finalists linebackers Bolton of Mizzou and Arkansas' Grant Morgan, the senior former walk-on from Greenwood leading the nation with 104 tackles.
   
 "I mean they're both tremendous linebackers," Drinkwitz said. "They both make a lot of tackles. And you can tell leaders of the defense on both sides of the ball."
   
 He discussed both as individuals.
   
 "Nick, I think I'm so impressed with his life off the football field as I am his life on the football field," Drinkwitz said. "He shows up early, works out all the time and has a 3.4 GPA. Just does everything the right way. Has got great manners. His parents have obviously raised him the right way. I think the same can be said for Grant."
   
 Drinkwitz has a history with the Morgan family back when he was an Arkansas State assistant coach and Drew Morgan, Grant's older brother and former Razorbacks prolific receiver, was starring for Jones at Greenwood.
   
 "Obviously knew Grant from my time recruiting his brother Drew when I was at Arkansas State," Drinkwitz said. "He's just got great work ethic. You can tell it matters to him. I think the most impressive thing about Grant when he makes a tackle he runs back to get lined up on defense. It's very rare to see that. Always impressed with his hustle and work ethic. He's going to be a tough one to go against."

A BEEF TO THE Town of Comox for allowing fireworks in our community, a community that has a large number of serving military and veterans who need our support, empathy and understanding as many struggle to come to terms with the sounds associated with their most difficult experiences. Why not restrict this activity in Comox at least, an activity that is merely a moment of fun for a few, but can have devastating internal repercussions to so many. Added to the obvious similarity to the sound of explosions and gunfire is the surprise element to those who hear them, those who, due to the nature of their PTSD, cannot speak for themselves. The respect we show our veterans and military, as well as their families, can take many forms and should not be limited to one day set aside in November each year.

Whether it's expensive meals out, pet hair in the car or mailing packages safely, my readers are always anxious to share their best tips, tricks and ideas for ways to save time and money.
   
 Restaurant Eats, Cheap
   
 My husband and I just got back from our anniversary vacation in San Francisco. (It was a gift from my in-laws, God love 'em!) I went to eBay ahead of time and typed in "San Francisco, California" and found some great deals from a website called restaurant.com. I got three $25 dining certificates for $5 each. We were able to enjoy some amazing meals without me worrying so much about the bill coming at the end. -- Kimberly
   
 Laundry Savings
   
 I put a piggy bank on the shelf above my washer. Whenever I find money in the washer or dryer, I put it in there. I figure that by the time I need to buy a new washer or dryer, I'll have at least a good down payment. Nobody has ever missed the money they left in their pants. -- Kate
   
 Pronto Pet Hair Pickup
   
 If you have a dog who enjoys frequent car rides, as mine does, I'm sure you know firsthand what a pain all that dog hair can be to clean up. For a quick fix when there's no time to drag out the vacuum, simply slip on a latex- covered gardening glove, and run your hand across the upholstery. Trust me, it works like a charm! -- Cindy
   
 Storage Boxes
   
 At age 72, my sight isn't the best. So, I have decided to put pictures of the content on the front of my storage boxes instead of writing on them. For example, if I have stuff for Easter, I would put an Easter card or something else that reminds me of Easter on the front. That way, I know that box has Easter stuff inside. -- Catherine
   
 Track Credit Spending
   
 Make a register, similar to the register in your checkbook, for each of your credit cards. Get lined 4-by-6-inch index cards. Mark the width of the credit card and twice the length on the lined side. Draw a vertical line about 1/2 inch from each side, leaving a wider column in the center. You will be able to cut two of these from each card. Fold the register you have just made around your credit card, and store it in your wallet. Each time you charge an item, log it on the register. Add the amounts up periodically. This way, there will be no surprises when the bill arrives. -- Frances
   
 Sock Washing
   
 Like most bachelors, I hated sorting clean laundry. Worst of all was trying to match up socks. I came up with a solution: When I take socks off, before throwing them into the hamper, I safety pin them together at the toe. This keeps them matched up during the washing and drying process. I also found that pinning my dryer sheets to a set of socks keeps the dryer sheets from being caught up against the lint trap. -- Jim
   
 Free Packing Material
   
 I hate storing packing peanuts, and I refuse to pay for them! Instead, I use plastic grocery shopping bags, which are still readily available in many areas. Just bunch them up and tuck them in around the item you're shipping. They're easy to store, always handy and best of all, free! -- Bianca

States drafted plans Thursday for who will go to the front of the line when the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine become available later this month, as U.S. deaths from the outbreak eclipsed 3,100 in a single day, obliterating the record set last spring.
 With initial supplies of the vaccine certain to be limited, governors and other state officials are weighing both health and economic concerns in deciding the order in which the shots will be dispensed.
 States face a Friday deadline to submit requests for doses of the Pfizer vaccine and specify where they should be shipped, and many appear to be heeding nonbinding guidelines adopted this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to put health care workers and nursing home patients first.
 But they're also facing a multitude of decisions about other categories of residents — some specific to their states; some vital to their economies.
 Colorado's draft plan, which is being revised, puts ski resort workers who share close quarters in the second phase of vaccine distribution, in recognition of the $6 billion industry's linchpin role in the state's economy.
 In Nevada, where officials have stressed the importance of bringing tourists back to the Las Vegas Strip, authorities initially put nursing home patients in the third phase, behind police officers, teachers, airport operators and retail workers. But they said Wednesday that they would revise that plan to conform to the CDC guidance.
 In Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said health care and long-term care facility workers are the top priority, but the state was still refining who would be included in the next phase. A draft vaccination plan submitted to the CDC in October listed poultry workers along with other essential workers such as teachers, law enforcement and correctional employees in the so-called 1B category.
 Poultry is a major part of Arkansas' economy, and nearly 6,000 poultry workers have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began, according to the state Health Department.
 "We know these workers have been the brunt of large outbreaks not only in our state, but also in other states," said Dr. Jose Romero, the state's health secretary and chairman of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
 Plans for the vaccine are being rolled out as the surging pandemic swamps U.S. hospitals and leaves nurses and other medical workers shorthanded and burned out. Nationwide, the coronavirus is blamed for more than 275,000 deaths and 14 million confirmed infections.
 The U.S. recorded 3,157 deaths on Wednesday alone, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. That's more than the number of people killed on 9/11 and shattered the old mark of 2,603, set on April 15, when the New York metropolitan area was the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak.
 The number of Americans in the hospital with the coronavirus likewise hit an all-time high Wednesday at more than 100,000, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The figure has more than doubled over the past month. And new cases per day have begun topping 200,000, by Johns Hopkins' count.
 The three main benchmarks showed a country slipping deeper into crisis, with perhaps the worst yet to come — in part because of the delayed effects from Thanksgiving, when millions of Americans disregarded warnings to stay home and celebrate only with members of their household.
 Keeping health care workers on their feet is considered vital to dealing with the crisis. And nursing home patients have proven highly vulnerable to the virus. Patients and staff members at nursing homes and other long-term care centers account for 39% of the nation's COVID-19 deaths.
 As authorities draw up their priority lists for the vaccine, firefighter groups asked the Minnesota governor to placed in the first group. The Illinois plan gives highest priority to health care workers but also calls for first responders to be in the first batch to get the shot. Other states are struggling with where to put prisoners in the pecking order.
 Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said he wants teachers to get priority so schools can stay open. Two California lawmakers asked for that, too, saying distance learning is harming students' education.
 "Our state's children cannot afford to wait," wrote Republican Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham and Democratic Assemblyman Patrick O'Donnell. "This is too important to overlook or sweep aside."
 Texas is putting hospital staff, nursing home workers and paramedics at the top of the list, followed by outpatient medical employees, pharmacists, funeral home workers and school nurses. Nursing home patients did not make the cut for the first phase.
 Likewise, Utah officials said Thursday that frontline health care workers will take top priority, with the five hospitals treating the most COVID-19 patients getting the first doses. State health officials said that additional doses likely will be available in February and March for more hospital workers, and essential workers — including police officers, firefighters and teachers — also will be prioritized.
 Advocates strongly expressed frustration over the way some states are putting medical workers ahead of nursing home residents.
 "It would be unconscionable not to give top priority to protect the population that is more susceptible or vulnerable to the virus," said John Sauer, head of LeadingAge in Wisconsin, a group representing nonprofit long-term care facilities.
 He added: "I can't think of a more raw form of ageism than that. The population that is most vulnerable to succumbing to this virus is not going to be given priority? I mean, that just says we don't value the lives of people in long-term care."
 Iowa, which expects to get 172,000 doses over the next month, will make them available first to health care workers and nursing home residents and staff, while an advisory council will recommend who comes next to "minimize health inequities based on poverty, geography" and other factors, state Human Services Director Kelly Garcia said.
 For example, prison inmates and residents of state institutions for the disabled aren't in the first round but will be put ahead of others, she said.
