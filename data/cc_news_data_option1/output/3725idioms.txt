Roughly 7 in 10 Americans think the nation is on the wrong track, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It's an assessment that poses a challenge for Trump as he urges voters to stay the course and reward him with four more years in office instead of handing the reins of government to Democrat Joe Biden.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Brandon Nimmo took a couple of slow steps and gawked at the winning homer he smacked to right.
 The kind of reaction was a bit out of character for Nimmo.
 That kind of crushing, ninth-inning blow was to true to form for the Phillies bullpen.
 Nimmo had a two-RBI tying triple in the sixth inning and hit the go-ahead solo homer in the ninth to lead the New York Mets to a 10-6 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday night.
 Nimmo’s eighth homer of the year landed in the right field seats off reliever Brandon Workman (1-3) for a 7-6 lead and was the latest big hit against the beleaguered Phillies bullpen.
 “It’s the slowest he’s come out of the box in his career,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said. “He had that big smile running the bases and coming into the dugout.”

LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - Like with other services, such as electricity or garbage pick up, opinions vary greatly when it comes to the United States Postal Service. Now, many have concerns and questions about mail delivery after Hurricane Laura. “I’m missing some debit cards that were mailed to me,” said Keina Harris as she waited in line. “I guess it’s over here from what I know, that’s what they said.” It’s been three weeks since Hurricane Laura, and Thursday, Harris waited in line at the downtown Lake Charles post office hoping to get her mail. However, she wasn’t alone. The parking lot remained full as people waited to pick up their mail, though USPS Communications Specialist Nikki Johnson says delivery service is up and running. “We are delivering mail services where it is safe to do so. We can proudly say that out of the 28 units that were initially impacted, we’re down now to five [closed],” Johnson explained. While some are getting mail delivered, others still haven’t received anything in weeks. Johnson says it may be because of a damaged mailbox or a dangerous street. “...Where their mailbox is maybe just totally missing or gone, or it’s just unsafe to access, we ask that if possible, if they can replace the mail receptacle, they definitely can do that,” Harris said. “Their mail is being held at the local Post Office or the alternate site.” Others were at the post office to forward mail to a temporary address or even request the office hold their mail, something Johnson suggests. “We want to make sure that their mail follows them. They may not have their locations set at that time, but we do offer temporary forwarding orders.” As far as post office locations, most are operational, while others have been replaced with temporary buildings, P.O. boxes and package centers. Additional staff is also being brought in to help carry the load, Which has some people like Linda Glaude pretty excited. “Oh my gosh I got so much mail! Look at all this mail,” she said as she ran toward our cameras, unzipping her bag, excited to get mail and a small bit of normalcy back in her life. “The lady that was in there telling us to be calm, be patient, treat everybody right - It was well worth the wait."Copyright 2020 KPLC.

A British insurance marketplace in business since 1871 will pay up to $25 million of wildfire costs in Oregon under the state's one-of-a-kind wildfire insurance.
 The policy with Lloyd's of London calls for the state to pay the first $50 million in costs, then Lloyd's pays the next $25 million. Anything above that would be covered by the state, along with federal assistance.
 According to the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center, a logistical center for regional fires, Oregon has spent over $53 million on firefighting during the current fire season. That would trigger the insurance policy.
 Jim Gersbach, spokesman for the Oregon Department of Forestry said he couldn't confirm the NICC estimate. He outlined the policy's amounts, limits and history.

It’s Julio Urías’ dominance from the second inning onward that makes his struggles in the first so confounding.
 That season-long trend was exemplified Thursday night, as the Dodgers starter allowed two runs in the opening frame against the Colorado Rockies before shutting down their lineup down over the next five.
 The latter stretch was good enough to help the Dodgers win 9-3 at Coors Field, bringing their magic number for an NL West title down to five. The former, however, only added to the last big question mark hovering over the left- hander with the start of the playoffs less than two weeks away.
 Urías ran into trouble from the start, missing the zone with three straight fastballs to begin the game. He eventually worked that opening at-bat to a full count but surrendered a payoff pitch single to Raimel Tapia. Trevor Story doubled in another full count after that, allowing Charlie Blackmon to open the scoring with a sac fly and Kevin Pillar to make it 2-0 on an RBI single. By the time the inning ending, Urías had thrown 26 pitches.

Jon Gosselin spoke with _Entertainment Tonight_ on Wednesday, delivering a public message to ex-wife Kate Gosselin and opening up about abuse allegations that have floated around against him. Gosselin has denied the claims made against him and was reportedly cleared of the allegations after an investigation by police.
 Kate Gosselin called her ex-husband a "violent and abusive person" amid the controversy surrounding a deleted post alleging that Jon Gosselin was physically abusive toward him. Gosselin spoke directly to his ex while on _ET_ Wednesday.
 "Kate, the message to you is to stop," Gosselin said. "Unless you don't want to have any ounce of any relationship with your children in the future. You're ruining that. It's not about me, It's about how they have to live their life by you making false accusations about things that never occurred."
 Gosselin also expanded on the incident that led to the suspected child abuse, which had been found as "unfounded" according to a letter from Pennsylvania Children and Youth Services. The embattled father seems to be sticking close to his role as a caregiver to his son and his sole custody of Collin and his daughter Hannah.
 "It escalated into something, you know, I had to restrain him and I've done that a couple times. I didn't think he would call the police but he wanted to get his way and the police did their investigation and there were no charges or citations filed," Gosselin details to the outlet. "I've gone to all his therapy sessions. I've put him in school. I've walked him through everything. He's got a job, stuff like that, and Kate hasn't talked to him in five years. I mean, Kate didn't show up for his custody battle when they awarded me sole legal and physical custody. So now I find it interesting that she's so concerned about a child she doesn't even talk to. ... I mean, I find that interesting, so everyone can make their mind up of what she's trying to do."
 Kate Gosselin has also been accused of abuse in the past, with authorities never finding anything. She quickly hit out against her ex-husband after allegations against him hit the headlines, claiming she was "done hiding" and called Jon Gosselin "abusive."

 "The police need to do their jobs. I am so sick of Jon's abuse being disguised as everything but. I don't want my children around him. Enough is enough," Kate Gosselin said. Her ex-husband has stated numerous times that he doesn't have contact with his reality star wife or his children on that end. In turn, she reportedly hasn't spoken to her son Collin in 5 years and didn't show up to his custody hearing, prompting Jon Gosselin to get full custody. For him, he does want happier times to return according to his interview.
 "My wish is that all my kids would just be together, like, hang out together," he told the outlet. "Kate and I don't live that far away from each other and I feel like there's an invisible wall. They should just be able to just get together. I mean, I have no qualms about it. If they wanna go meet each other, just go ahead. But I feel like it's more on the other side."
