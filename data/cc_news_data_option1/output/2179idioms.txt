The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Thursday sought views of its member-lawyers on the resumption of regular courtroom proceedings in the court which has been holding virtual hearings since March 25 when the COVID-19-induced lockdown was imposed.          A three-judge panel, comprising Justices N.V. Ramana, Arun Mishra and U.U. Lalit, would review on Friday the functioning of the Supreme Court in light of the surging pandemic cases in Delhi and the adjoining area, and the views of the SCBA has been sought for on the issue.           The review meeting would take place amid rising demands from bar bodies, including the Bar Council of India and the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA), to resume physical courtroom hearings on various grounds including that the virtual court system was not working well in favour of many lawyers.

So many shows lose me as an audience because they become so preachy and on the nose. They take a protagonist and they define them by their struggle, whereas I don't think anyone in life is merely defined by their struggle of being a minority, their sexual orientation or their mental illness. I think comedy replicates life a little bit more than drama does. There are things that we all go through, but we learn to laugh about a lot of them and brush it off. There are also very serious issues tackled in the show, but it's not so on the nose and preachy that it just defines everyone. So I think that's a little note that everyone can take,  that in real life there's no person, I believe, that is fully defined by their struggle.

Just because stocks have scrambled nearly all the way back to their record heights doesn’t necessarily mean the market is in the clear.           Stocks have a long history of making big gains within long-term down markets, only for the bottom to give out again. Such mini-, ultimately futile rallies were regular occurrences during the Great Depression, and they’ve been recurring in some of the most recent downturns. They’ve happened often enough that Wall Street has a name for them: bear market rallies.           While many analysts say they don’t expect stocks to fall all the way back to their lows set in March, much of Wall Street says the recent surge of nearly 40% for stocks may be setting investors up for disappointment, with rougher times likely to come.           “There’s no question that it’s going to be a choppy recovery,” said Rich Weiss, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies for American Century Investments. “I have no doubt there will be setbacks.”          At first, it was massive rescue programs by the Federal Reserve and Capitol Hill lifting the market, and more recently it’s been hopes that the worst of the recession has already passed or will soon as businesses begin to gradually reopen across the country. And at each step of the way, many professional investors have said they think the rally has been too much, too fast.           A little more than two thirds of fund managers say this is nothing more than a bear market rally, according to the latest monthly survey by Bank of America conducted in May.

ATLANTA (AP) — In the wake of nationwide protests over police brutality, Georgia Tech wants to make sure its athletes take time to vote in November.          The school said Thursday that nine teams, including football, will cancel all mandatory activities on Nov. 3 to recognize the importance of casting a ballot.          Geoff Collins was one of the first Power Five football coaches to express his support for those protesting the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.          That officer and three others present were fired  and have since been charged in an incident that sparked widespread protests  and rekindled the debate over the country’s injustice toward African Americans.          “I need to find a way to lend my voice to what’s going on in the black community,” Collins, who is white, told reporters this week on a video conference call. “It matters to me. For far too long, I’ve been an internal guy, sending my thoughts and prayers and really seeing how this impacts guys on a daily basis my entire career.          “It was on my heart to step out with a small statement, lend a small voice, share my voice and try to find a way to help the healing process, make this world a better place. I want to let my guys know and the black community as a whole know that your experience matters. You matter. Your hopes matter. Your dreams matter. Your life matters."

The static nature of sanctions not only makes them toothless; it also produces harmful effects on U.S. policy. Because sanctions are rarely lifted, they tend to accumulate over time at a steady, if intermittent, pace. As sanctions snowball, so do their objectives, worsening the convoluted problem outlined above. The net result is that, almost by default, nearly every sanctions program eventually aims for regime change. (It’s hardly surprising that one of the only times America has ended a sanctions program in recent history—when President Obama did so with respect to Burma in 2016—came after Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League of Democracy won a majority of seats in Burma’s parliament.) With a tortuous web of sanctions and policy objectives, most adversary regimes rightly assess that the only way out of sanctions is to call it quits. But no government will commit political suicide to undo sanctions.

All state and municipal leaders need to know about controlling riots is obvious from a cursory review of the history.          Consider the worst disturbance in recent times, the L.A. riots. They began when about two dozen cops retreated before an angry crowd after the Rodney King verdicts, some of them literally running away. The mob descended on the intersection of Florence and Normandie, and began beating Anglo and Latino motorists, completely unmolested by the authorities for hours. Some police reported being ordered to leave the area — and then being ordered not to return. A couple of squad cars drove through the intersection without stopping.          The rest is history — days of violence, more than 60 people killed and 2,000 injured, and in excess of $1 billion in property damage. By the end, thousands of federal troops were in the city.          Back in 1970, in his classic book on domestic unrest, The Riotmakers, Eugene Methvin identified police absence or pullback as the accelerant on riots. It was a huge factor in the Watts riots in 1965. The same dynamic held in a Philadelphia riot the year before (an officer there expressed exactly the same sentiment as a retreating LAPD officer in 1992, “The hell with it. Let them do what they want”). In Detroit in 1967, cops retreated and the authorities underestimated the forces they needed as a riot devastated the city.          It is simply not true that rioters will be quickly sated if they are allowed to break and burn things freely. Disorder feeds on itself. Looting one store, overturning one police car is never enough.          There is no alternative to imposing curfews, zealously enforcing them, arresting violators and calling out the National Guard if there’s not enough police manpower for the job. This doesn’t escalate the violence, it stops it.          Over the weekend, Minneapolis finally got more serious about policing itself and saw a drastic diminishment of destruction. Anyone who doesn’t want American cities to burn should take note.

Manuse said the mandated restrictions are killing the economy, causing more harm than the virus. As of Tuesday, there had been 4,749 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in New Hampshire with 3,071 people recovered and 256 deaths.          John Nyhan, president of the Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce and a member of the governor’s task force, said he understands the group’s frustrations. He said the task force and governor want to see the economy fully reopened, too, but they want it done safely and based on recommendations of public health officials.          “I think we are doing everything possible (to reopen),” Nyhan said. “Everybody would love to be back to normal, but I believe we have to comply with public health because it’s not normal.”          He said the new beach rules are temporary and were made so the beaches could safely reopen to the public after being closed for two months.          Manuse said they wanted to bring a rally to the beach because they believe the restrictions are “arbitrary edicts” and question the science behind them.          “Gov. Chris Sununu thinks it is OK for us to stand and watch our children play in the water, but it is not OK to lie or sit down on a beach towel,” Manuse said.          He said the rally will be peaceful, but they will not be following the beach rules. “We’re going to sit down on the beach and enjoy everything it has to offer,” Manuse said. “We may even build a sandcastle. We will definitely draw a line in the sand. We’re asking folks to bring footballs or Frisbees to play catch, a shovel and bucket, as well as their beach towel to sit on, or dry off if they’re feeling bold.”          JR Hoell, treasurer of ReopenNH, said they plan to declare New Hampshire is open statewide.          “It is time to say, ‘No more,’ ” Hoell said. “No more stay-at-home orders, no more lockdowns, no more arbitrary rules, no more junk science used to justify poor public policy, and no more state of emergency.”

          Remember the turtle and the hare?          All right, it was actually a tortoise in the fable, but the lesson still applies.          Slow and steady wins the race.          That's something to remember this time of year when we see turtles slowly, slowly, slowly make their way across local roads in search of food and to nest.          They're coming off hibernation and in a hurry. That is, the turtle version of hurry.          MassWildlife recently issued its accustomed warning for motorists to keep on the lookout for the slow-steady creatures.          \"From mid-May to early July, thousands of turtles throughout Massachusetts travel to new areas to find food and nest. You may find turtles on roadways, in your backyard, or other unexpected locations as they move across the landscape to find resources they need to survive.\"          These are important lessons to learn. But there's also a deeper lesson involved in seemingly suicidal turtle meanderings.          I learned a few years back around this time of year that the lesson involves the power of fate.          I was on a morning commute along a very busy two-lane, east-west highway.          The posted speed limits along this stretch ranged from 45 mph to 65 mph, which many motorists seem to view as the state's way of saying travel at least 70 mph.          Eighteen-wheeler trucks hauling everything from gravel to seafood rumbled along.          My attention was drawn to one of these jumbo trucks on this particular morning. It was approaching in the opposite direction.          And that's when I noticed the snapping turtle, slowly, slowly, slowly walking onto the highway with the obvious intention of crossing over to the other side - across both lanes.          You could have timed its progress with a sundial.          The traffic was so heavy here and the roadway so narrow that to pull over for a rescue would be dangerous to the would-be Good Samaritan, passing vehicles and the turtle, as well.          That is, if the snapper decided to docilely cooperate with rescue efforts, a behavioral response not to be expected in the species.          So why was the snapping turtle attempting to cross the road?          Yeah, yeah, to get to the other side, right. But at this time of year it was probably because she was a female looking for a sandy spot to lay her eggs.          This momma snapper (which I assumed her to be) was a fairly young one judging by the size - maybe 15 pounds. The path nature had predestined for her was extremely perilous.          I don't think even that speedy loud-mouthed hare could have made it across that road.          I drove on, already cringing at the gruesome sight I anticipated viewing on my return trip that evening.          I proceeded to work and soon forgot about the momma turtle and her march to oblivion.          It came back to me, of course, on the drive home as I approached the area where I'd spotted her that morning.          I didn't want to see the result of her bad fortune in picking a route, but I couldn't help looking.          But there were no grisly turtle remains to be seen.          I turned around and traveled back along the opposite route to make sure the reckless reptile's remains were not elsewhere.          Lo and don't behold.          No squished turtle.          So now we come to the lesson part:          Should we gather that fate is immutable, as in Greek tragedy?          Or that perseverance can conquer all, as in a morality play?          You make the call.          Of course, it could also mean that we really shouldn't read a whole lot into turtle behavior.          Because I doubt those hatchlings could have made it back across.           _Courier & Sentinel Editor Frank Mulligan can be reached at fmulligan@wickedlocal.com_          "

Protestors embrace during a rally in response to the recent death of George Floyd in Miami, Florida on Tuesday. Photo: AFP                        What is happening in the US did not come out of the blue.               America is a sick society, in more ways than one. The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic was not a fluke and not President Donald Trump's fault alone. For generations, the US health care system has not adequately served the majority of Americans. Even before the novel coronavirus spread, Americans were afflicted with a bevy of diseases caused by poor diet and other preventable factors. Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases had already reached epidemic proportions. Many of the elderly were shunted off to nursing facilities to wait out their final days.               US' long-neglected minorities have been especially vulnerable. Native Americans, blacks, and Latinos have the worst health outcomes, on a par with emerging nations, while working-class whites are not far behind. Hospitals have been privatized and many communities lack any sort of primary health care, so when sickness or injury occurs they must rely on local emergency rooms for rudimentary care. All these got compounded when the pandemic struck. Advisory bodies had warned of the potential for a pandemic wreaking havoc on the US health care system, and their dire predictions came true, with minorities, the elderly, and the poor being the primary victims.              But the sick society has even deeper roots. Racism and poverty are endemic and even after over 50 years of attempts at remediation very little has changed. Still today, the poverty rate hovers at about 12 percent, but the majority of Americans of all backgrounds live paycheck to paycheck, with hardly enough money to pay for a $400 emergency.               Black and Latino communities are ravaged by high rates of un- and under-employment. Minority youth receive an inferior education with resources siphoned off to the wealthier suburbs, leaving them unprepared for the job market and having low-end, dead-end jobs. The attraction of easy money from selling drugs that serve as a palliative for the trauma of living in communities ravaged by poverty and addiction is too great a temptation for many, resulting in one-third of minority men facing incarceration and a lifetime of discrimination as a convicted felon.              Minority communities are occupied territory with the police acting as local bullies, terrorizing the black community with wanton violence. So add a pervasive social sickness to the health crisis that pervades American society.              An economic crisis brought about by COVID-19 has exposed the underlying weakness of the American economy, characterized by extreme wealth disparities and a lack of well-paying jobs. Many white youths, burdened with exorbitant loans for their college education find themselves with no other work than service jobs of one sort or another, with low pay and few if any benefits              On top of it all, the ruling elites in the US can find all the money they need for armaments and military adventures abroad and more than enough money to bail out corporate America and billionaire moguls, but ironically not enough to rebuild a decrepit infrastructure or fund basic social services.              All these underlying tensions exploded with the brutal police murder of George Floyd. The visceral rage that people of all backgrounds held within them boiled over. After months of social isolation and economic deprivation, people erupted, shouting "I can't breathe" - a primal scream that reflects not just George Floyd's final exclamation, but the feelings of abandonment and oppression felt by millions of Americans.              The old America of racial inequality and capitalist exploitation at home and imperialist aggression abroad has come to a tipping point. But out of its current dystopia what will emerge? What will the birth pangs of a new society produce? That is the question that all Americans must now face.               _The author holds a doctorate in anthropology from the University of California, Berkley, and conducted archaeological and anthropological research in China throughout the 1980s and 1990s and taught at the college and university level for over 35 years. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn_

This move was critical because while the CARES Act was built on the hope that most businesses would be up and running by now, the reality is that many bars, restaurants, hotels and other businesses are nearing the end of their initial 8-week covered period only to remain partially or fully suspended by state or local order. More time to incur forgivable costs is essential, and Congress has supplied just that.

"The action taken to restrict media was to comply with social distancing regulations as a means to combat the spread of Covid-19," The Presidency said in a statement. "The incident happened as result of miscommunication between the Presidency Media Team and the Ministry of Health and Social Services and is highly regrettable. The RSVP list was a precautionary measure in light of the health regulations under the state of emergency and subsequent actions of the security officials were not of ill intent or deliberate, but simply enforcing compliance to regulations. We would like to reassure the media that the Presidency values the important role of the media in a healthy democracy and will continue to ensure media freedom as guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Namibia. The Presidency media team extends its most sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused by this incident."

Luszey said her feelings are “definitely mixed” about being able to get back to work. She said knowing she works closely with people — not in a way that accommodates social distancing — puts a lot of pressure on her as a provider to make sure her clients are safe.          “There’s a lot of responsibility we have to take on,” Luszey said. “Making sure that our clients haven’t been exposed, or are experiencing symptoms, and are safe while they’re here. That’s a big responsibility on all of us service providers. Even though the guidelines seem excessive, it’s just to protect us and the clients.”          After all, Luszey said, there’s not really a frame of reference for the current situation.          “Because we haven’t gone through anything like this before, [the state guidelines] are erring on the side of caution, and personally, I’m for that, rather than potentially putting myself and my clients at risk.”          But while businesses are opening up again, it’s not completely business as usual, even setting aside precautionary protocols. Smith said the European Aesthetics tea room is shut down, and they aren’t offering certain services which would require the customer to remove their face mask, such as lip waxes and — one of their most popular services — facials. Luszey said some of her regular services, such as eyelash extensions, are off the table for the time being.          Luszey said she’s also had to adjust her prices, to accommodate the extra protective equipment she uses with every client — which are still hard to come by and expensive when she finds them, she said. Also, most of her supplies have risen in price compared to the start of the year.          Vaillancourt said she is still charging her usual rates, but said the additional time she’s working before and after appointments to sanitize is going to impact the amount of clients she sees in a day for the foreseeable future.          “There a definite and significant impact that some of us are really trying to wrap our heads around at this stage,” Vaillancourt said. “So much of our local economy comes from local businesses, and it’s hard not to see how this won’t have a long-term impact, but it’s such unknown territory.”          However, even with limitations, providers said they’re eager to get back to work.          “It’s amazing, and if feels good to be able to safely provide for people who have been going without all this time,” Vaillancourt said.

The prevention study was dreamed up by David Boulware at the University of Minnesota. "This is not my day job," he says. "My normal research is doing clinical trials in Africa for fungal meningitis of the brain."                       He remembers thinking somebody needed to do something to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and the he realized, "I think that's us."                       So he got his team together, and they put together this study of hydroxychloroquine. "Within eight days, we basically had the trial up and running," including all the necessary regulatory approvals." Remarkably, fewer than three months from the day was conceived, he had a paper in a prestigious medical journal.                       Researchers have been interested in the possibility of using hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat COVID-19 because it seems to impair the virus' ability to infect cells in the lab. The drug's effectiveness in treating hospitalized patients is still an open question, but if there is a benefit, it is most likely a small one.                       Now it appears the drug is not effective at preventing disease in people who have been exposed with minimal or no protection. It remains an open question whether it might be effective in preventing the disease in people who have used appropriate protective gear to prevent exposure. There is currently a multi-center study underway intended to enroll 15,000 people to answer that question.

OPELIKA, Ala. (AP) — The family of the stepdaughter of a UFC fighter found dead last year was emotional as a police detective testified about how the Alabama college student was found. Auburn Police Detective Josh Mixon testified in a Lee County courtroom Wednesday that a witness said he was with Ibraheem Yazeed when Yazeed appeared to drag a body, wrapped in a comforter, into the woods near Shorter, Alabama, news outlets reported. “Tell me that’s not a body,” Mixon testified the witness as saying. “Yazeed replies, ‘It won’t come back on you or your family,’” Mixon said. Yazeed is charged with capital murder in the death Aniah Blanchard, 19. Blanchard, the stepdaughter of UFC fighter Walt Harris, was found dead in a wooded area in Macon County last November. “I can’t imagine what her family is going through,” Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes told WRBL-TV. “Murder cases are ugly. You have to talk about these things. You have to talk about these things in somewhat of a dispassionate way.” Police previously said Yazeed was seen forcing Blanchard into her car at a gas station last October. Mixon testified that Blanchard came into contact with Yazeed at a gas station and they left together, according to news outlets. Blanchard and Yazeed then stopped at a second gas station where he went inside and while she remained in the driver's seat. He returned to the passenger's seat and they both left, Mixon said. Yazeed’s attorney, William Whatley Jr., said Blanchard willingly allowed Yazeed into her car, news outlets reported. Whatley said there's no evidence a crime was committed in Lee County since her car was found in Montgomery and her body in Macon County.

Some in the Hmong community argue "you can't be both pro-Hmong and pro-black," she says.                       For the Twin Cities' Hmong community, the debate over anti-blackness is mostly being talked about behind closed doors. But much of the rest of Asian America seems to be experiencing a more public reckoning, with discussions erupting online over not just anti-blackness sentiment but also communities of color and solidarity.                       While many Asian American activist groups, including Thao-Urabe's, were quick to condemn Floyd's death, come out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and even take to the streets — including the mother of Fong Lee, a young Hmong man shot and killed by Minneapolis police in 2006 — many Asian Americans don't agree.

Election Day comes four days before Georgia Tech’s football team is scheduled to host Duke.          Other teams that pledged to refrain from any mandatory activities on Nov. 3 include men’s and women’s basketball, both of which will be preparing for the start of their seasons, along with women's volleyball, men’s swimming and diving, and the men’s and women’s teams for tennis and indoor track and field.          In addition, the women’s swimming and diving team has a meet scheduled for Nov. 3 but is working with its opponent to hold the competition on another date.          “I am very proud of our student-athletes and coaches for identifying a great way that they can take action to make a difference in our communities and society,” Georgia Tech athletic director Todd Stansbury said in a statement. “It is our responsibility to provide student-athletes with an environment that promotes civic duty.”          Women’s basketball coach Nell Fortner and men’s basketball coach Josh Pastner began pushing the idea after meeting with athletes to discuss ways to make a difference. According to the school, other coaches quickly signed on to support the initiative.          “I lead a group of strong, young women, student-athletes from all backgrounds and nationalities,” Fortner said. “To my African American players and staff, I stand behind you and beside you as our nation continues to find its way for total equality for African American people. On Nov. 3, 2020, all of our voices can be heard and I will encourage my student-athletes to be heard.”

Personally, I'm in the first camp; I think it needs the M Sport package to look halfway decent. There's no getting around its crazy looking grille. No package or add-on is going to change the fact that the new BMW 4 Series has a grille like Steve Buscemi. So the rest of the car needs some crazy, too. I'm personally of the belief that you can't just take a sophisticated looking car, slap a giant grille on it and call it a day. Design needs to be cohesive, so the rest of the car should match the outrageousness of the grille.

“Self-love has been on the back burner these days,” Smith said. “So to be able to just have a time-out is wonderful. We have a heart in what we do, and we receive by giving, and that’s something we’ve really missed.”          That preparation meant emptying the shop of a lot of the atmosphere that makes the shop what it is — comfortable pillows and blankets for example. It’s a blow to have to make those adjustments, Smith said, but she knows it’s in the name of safety.          “I feel really safe,” she said. “Our clients respect us, and they’re not going to take a risk with us or themselves. We want to preserve their health.”          Like many by-appointment services now, personal care services are limited to having only as many customers in their stores as they have technicians, with waiting rooms being relegated to individuals in their cars in the parking lot or waiting outside for their turn. Both customers and providers are instructed to wear face masks, and providers are to disinfect between clients.          Heather Vaillancourt, owner of Monadnock Therapeutic Bodyworks in Peterborough, said massage therapy is a service that likely could have been operating safely earlier, or been considered an essential service. Many of her customers are referred to her through chiropractors or physical therapists, who were deemed essential and never shut down. She said when she officially announced her June 1 opening date, her online booking system was flooded with requests.          “It was overwhelming to see how many were ready and willing to come in. There were many more than I had anticipated,” Vaillancourt said.          Michelle Luszey, who owns Nail Trends in Jaffrey, said she’s back at work as of Friday, taking a few extra days to ensure she’s got her protocols in place. She said she’s content to start a little slower, with mostly just her regulars, to test the waters and make sure everything is working as it should.

Marc Rebillet was supposed to be on tour this summer, playing electronic music at festivals throughout the United States and Europe.                       "Of course, those have been canceled," the New York City-based musician said.                       As COVID-19 sweeps across the world, musicians have been forced to postpone, reschedule or cancel tours altogether, leaving countless artists struggling to maintain their livelihoods.                       For Rebillet, bidding farewell to live shows means he is not only losing ticket sales, but also the force that fueled his work.                       "I'm a one-man show," he said. "I make up songs from scratch. And I rely a lot on my audience to give me the energy to do that."                       The coronavirus crisis has emboldened artists to come up with solutions. Rebillet was already hosting live-stream performances from home, but those are difficult, he said, because "you're still just alone in your apartment." He was looking for a way to recreate his improvised show amid the pandemic: a show with no plan, no set list and no preparation.                       Rebillet was on the verge of despair when he got a call from his agents. They told him that a musician in Germany was doing live shows at drive-in movie theaters, which left Rebillet feeling inspired. He thought it was a bold way to go on tour in the midst of a pandemic, so he and his team booked nine venues for a summer tour starting next week that will take him from Baltimore to Houston.

For the last few years, our team at Vanderbilt University, Gustavo Goldman's team at Sao Paulo University in Brazil and many other collaborators around the world have been collecting samples of fungi from patients infected with different species of Aspergillus molds. One of the species we are particularly interested in is Aspergillus nidulans, a relatively common and generally harmless fungus. Clinical laboratories typically identify the species of Aspergillus causing the infection by examining cultures of the fungi under the microscope. The problem with this approach is that very closely related species of Aspergillus tend to look very similar in their broad morphology or physical appearance when viewing them through a microscope.

The State government of Maharashtra has appointed a nine-member committee to understand the impact of COVID-19 on cooperative credit systems in the State. There are more than two lakh cooperative organisations in the State and they will need financial assistance in the post-lockdown period if they are to function at all. The committee has been tasked with making recommendations to ensure they get this. State Cooperative Commissioner Anil Kawade will chair the committee and hand over its report within two months.                          The cooperatives operate on a three-tier cooperative credit system, and have a total membership of 5.5 crore and more than three lakh employees. Their floating capital is Rs.3.5 lakh crore. The three-tier credit structure has the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) at the helm, followed by District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) and the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) that operate at the village level. The apex MSCB is responsible for refinancing and the DCCBs provide the actual agricultural and crop loans to farmers.                          The structure works in a top-down manner with the Central Financing Agencies Department of the MSCB looking after the finance aspect of the DCCBs for providing agricultural and non-agricultural advances under various refinance schemes of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). The final disbursal of funds is through the PACS and sometimes the DCCBs.                           The coronavirus crisis will affect banking across the board, so the government has set up a committee to monitor the COVID-19 impact on urban cooperative banks and urban and rural non-agricultural credit organisations. This committee will be chaired by Vidyadhar Anaskar, who is the president of the Maharashtra State Urban Banks Federation, and will also submit its report in two months.

ATLANTA (AP) — In the wake of nationwide protests over police brutality, Georgia Tech wants to make sure its athletes take time to vote in November. The school said Thursday that nine teams, including football, will cancel all mandatory activities on Nov. 3 to recognize the importance of casting a ballot. Geoff Collins was one of the first Power Five football coaches to express his support for those protesting the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. That officer and three others present were fired and have since been charged in an incident that sparked widespread protests and rekindled the debate over the country’s injustice toward African Americans. “I need to find a way to lend my voice to what’s going on in the black community,” Collins, who is white, told reporters this week on a video conference call. “It matters to me. For far too long, I’ve been an internal guy, sending my thoughts and prayers and really seeing how this impacts guys on a daily basis my entire career. “It was on my heart to step out with a small statement, lend a small voice, share my voice and try to find a way to help the healing process, make this world a better place.

The Indian Council of Medical Research has released a validated list of IgG ELISA kits to be used for serosurveys to understand the proportion of population exposed to COVID-19 including asymptomatic individuals. The IgG ELISA kits are the first indigenous antibody detection kits for coronavirus. The apex health research body has so far approved three batches of lsquoCOVID Kavach ELISA IgG kitsrsquo developed by Zydus Cadila Healthcare Ltd, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Besides, one batch of Euroimmun Anti- SARS-COV-2 ELISA IgG manufactured by Euroimmun US Inc, USA, and a batch of Erbalisa COVID-19 IgG ELISA manufactured by Calbiotech Inc, USA have also been approved. The Indian Council of Medical Research ICMR also mentioned the batch number, stating responsibility for batch to batch consistency lies with the manufacturer. The IgG ELISA tests are recommended for serosurveys to understand the proportion of population exposed to the infection, including asymptomatic individuals. Depending upon the level of seroprevalence of infection, matching public health interventions can be implemented for prevention and control of the disease, the research body said. Further, it should be used for survey in high-risk or vulnerable populations like healthcare workers, frontline workers, immune-compromised individuals, individuals in containment zones, to know who have been infected in the past and have now recovered.

TALLAHASSEE -- Florida counties are pushing Gov. Ron DeSantis to release nearly $1.3 billion in federal money that has been sitting in state coffers for more than two months, as local officials struggle to keep their communities afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.                           Twelve Florida counties with populations greater than 500,000 -- Brevard, Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Lee, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Orange and Volusia -- received $2.47 billion in direct payments from the U.S. Department of the Treasury through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the CARES Act, in March.                           But the other money -- $1.275 billion -- remains unspent, as counties increase pressure on the Republican governor to distribute funds to rural areas that have suffered since DeSantis and local officials shut down most businesses in March to prevent the spread of COVID-19.                           In recent days, counties have amped up their campaign to get DeSantis to release the funds, even as a disagreement appears to have died down over whether the federal act requires states to hand over the money to local governments.                           Counties and cities have been "drastically hurt" due to the COVID-19 epidemic, Florida Association of Counties spokeswoman Cragin Mosteller told The News Service of Florida in a telephone interview.                           "The CARES Act is an opportunity for these counties and cities to have additional resources that are needed in a global pandemic. So it is right to make sure they have those resources. It should not become a battle between governments. This is the federal government stepping in to make sure the citizens are cared for. And the state is holding onto that, rather than making sure that those funds go to our communities so they can take care of our citizens," Mosteller said.                           But a DeSantis administration official told the News Service on Wednesday that "everyone's been trying to get this money out as quickly as possible."                           The state wants to ensure that the funds are going to be properly distributed and used, said the official, who agreed to an interview on the condition of not being identified.                           "Anything that a city or a county misuses these funds on … we are responsible for repaying it to the federal government," the official said. "That's been the biggest concern that we've had, to make sure we get it right."                           There also "initially was a lot of confusion" about what the money could be used for, the official said.                           Following the passage of the CARES Act, the Treasury Department issued several sets of guidelines to help state and local officials figure out how the funds could be spent and distributed.                           The federal law allows state and local governments to make payments for programs that "are necessary expenditures incurred" because of the public health emergency, "were not accounted for in the budget most recently approved as of the date of the enactment" of the act on March 27 and were incurred between March 1 and December 30, 2020.                           Guidelines issued by the Treasury Department on April 22 also said the money could be used for "second-order effects" of the pandemic, "such as by providing economic support to those suffering from employment or business interruptions due to COVID-19-related business closures."                           The federal agency's latest guidelines, issued last week, resolved many of the questions DeSantis administration had about the program, according to the official.                           Okeechobee County Commissioner Terry Burroughs said his community wants to use the funds to issue $5,000 to $10,000 grants to local businesses that have suffered financial losses after being shuttered for more than two months. Such a program would mirror grants offered by some large counties that received the stimulus money directly from the federal government, Burroughs said.                           "Our biggest issue is trying to get our businesses up and running," Burroughs said in a telephone interview this week.                           Many businesses in Okeechobee County, which has a population of about 41,000, derive their annual income from the December-to-May tourist season, when visitors come to the lake area to fish, the commissioner said.                           The grants would be available to county-based businesses that have a maximum of 25 employees, Burroughs said.                           "We want to make sure they have a brick-and-mortar in Okeechobee County," he added.                           As the governor begins to reopen the state, the Florida Association of Counties and the Small County Coalition, comprised of 39 largely rural counties, continue to push DeSantis to release the money.                           "People are hurting. There are needs now," lobbyist Chris Doolin, who represents the Small County Coalition, told the News Service on Wednesday. Twenty-nine of the counties in the coalition are considered "fiscally constrained," based on the amount of money generated by local property taxes.                           The small counties are frustrated that neighboring large counties received the federal money more than 60 days ago, while "their economies are being totally decimated," said Doolin, who regularly issues updates that include a countdown of the number of days since the state received the CARES funds.                           Other states, including Missouri, Massachusetts and Kentucky, have released CARES money to local officials.                           Senate Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley, a Fleming Island Republican whose district includes a large swath of rural North Florida, said this week he understands that "everyone is understandably eager and anxious to spend" the federal funds.                           "Unfortunately, like other federal taxpayer dollars returning to our state, CARES Act funds come with significant strings attached," Bradley said in a prepared statement.                           Bradley urged local governments to "document and submit" their records to receive Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements, which are separate from the $1.275 billion cities and counties are trying to receive.                           "I join with local governments who are seeking to be made whole financially and whose residents are counting down the days until we can fully return to the quality of life that has made our state the envy of the world. In my view, the situation is still evolving, and additional data and information is needed for state government to make responsible decisions regarding such significant levels of funding," he said.

Workers with spray bottles and cloths wiped down the hand rails of flat-escalators leading into the parks and Citywalk, the resort's restaurant-entertainment complex that has been open for more than two weeks.                                                       “We feel like all the precautions were up to snuff.

After two months of relatively sound leadership, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray needs to steady his nerves even more as Maharashtra opens up after the lockdown. This is the moment the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been waiting for. Over the last many weeks, the party has kept up a steady political pressure against the ruling coalition, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), and especially against the Chief Minister.                          It is no secret that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar has been the guiding force in the six-month-old MVA, which consists of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress. He engineered the unusual alliance with the three parties, worked out a deal where Uddhav Thackeray would be the Chief Minister and Ajit Pawar of the NCP the Deputy Chief Minister, and after that went on to lead the government from behind the scenes.                           The BJP has ridiculed the Chief Minister for being a puppet, but the more accurate assessment is that Uddhav Thackeray has shown a least expected but warmly welcomed maturity in listening to experienced advice. His willingness to learn and discuss is completely against the widely understood “constitution” of his party, but it is this very difference that has earned him praise from Shiv Sena detractors.                          This is a testing time for Uddhav Thackeray and for his government because the staggered manner in which the State is being opened up could offer the BJP a last-ditch attempt to try and discredit the MVA. The BJP is waiting for a nervous Uddhav Thackeray, who is inexperienced in active politics and policy decision-making, to bungle. They also know that he would hate to be ousted from his post because it would be a feather in the BJP’s cap.                          But the BJP is fully aware that it is up against a formidable adversary in the form of Sharad Pawar. He has been persistent about opening up key areas of activity so that the economy can be kickstarted. But Uddhav Thackeray has resisted this. A mid-level bureaucrat in Mantralaya, requesting anonymity, said that the Chief Minister was “desperately worried” about the spread of infection if he opened up the State and the “impact it would have on his government politically”.                          The bureaucrat said that so far decision-making had not been difficult because there was “little option but to lockdown”, but now, with the need to open up again, the government needed to “consult varied experts right from doctors to trade associations” to understand the “dynamics of the State and how to go about getting back to normal”. He said the coordination required to get “Mumbai and the State moving again” was not yet in place.                          In a similar vein, a Pune Municipal Corporation official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “We are trained for this sort of administration. Now we have to put it into place.” He said ideally small hubs of commerce needed to be opened up and they should become like isolation facilities in themselves. For instance, workers in a factory should be checked for the virus and those free of it would have to live and work in the factory for whatever period was required. The factory owner would be responsible for their board and lodge. The plan sounds feasible, but even the official has doubts whether it will be put into operation. Mumbai is called the COVID hotspot of the nation, with 62 per cent of all cases reported in the State being from the city. It also has the highest number of deaths in the country. Rising numbers and the certainty of an extension of the fourth lockdown led to restlessness, which was freely expressed on social media.                           On May 23, the Maharashtra Police issued a prohibitory order which banned any criticism of the State’s decisions. It threatened action against anyone for posts that may create “mistrust towards government functionaries and their actions” in fighting the virus and causing panic and confusion or targeting any specific community. The gag order must also be seen in the context of the BJP’s constant attack on the MVA, especially on social media. This has ranged from calling for Uddhav Thackeray’s resignation to an outright call for Governor’s rule.                          The condition of the public health system in the State, especially in Mumbai, has been dragged into full public view by the coronavirus. This remains the actual crux of the issue, and the political game that is being played around it is just shadow boxing.                          ## Focus on Mumbai                          Trying to address this, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said he was focussing on beefing up public health care infrastructure. He said testing and the number of ambulances had been increased and a more proficient helpline had been instituted. He said the administration was aggressively “chasing the virus”. He was referring to increased testing, which would naturally show a rise in the numbers. Chahal said that until May 27 more than 1.7 lakh people had been tested in the city. The positivity rate has been 18 per cent and 15,800 of the active cases in Mumbai are asymptomatic. Whether or not these people were in self-quarantine was not known.                           Sticking to the same script, Uddhav Thackeray said on television that the State had increased its number of COVID-19 test laboratories from two in March to 72 on May 27. He said the State-level task force of 11 expert doctors had set a protocol on treating the patients. “We have succeeded in bringing down the COVID-19 fatality rate to 3.3 and the recovery rate to 31 per cent. The doubling time for the number of patients has increased from three days in April to 14 days in May end,” he said.                          Chahal said Mumbai had 75,000 hospital beds of which 44,000 were in dedicated COVID hospitals, dedicated COVID health centres, and COVID Care Centres that are meant for mild and asymptomatic patients (a BMC press note of the same date said there were only 18,000 beds for COVID cases). The Commissioner said the city would have 1,50,000 beds by June 15.                           Chahal also raised a point of concern. Hospitals were working with 40 per cent or less of their staff. The reality is that there are hundreds of health care workers who just cannot get to work because they stay in far-off suburbs. This is one example of the poor coordination the bureaucrat spoke of. “We obviously can’t open up the suburban train network fully. But we can selectively run trains and allow only essential services personnel to use them just like it was done with the BEST [public bus network].”                           While the Chief Minister has asked the Railway Ministry to start some suburban trains, the silence from the Centre is reminiscent of early April when he had asked for trains to repatriate people to their home States. The Centre had refused and the migrant worker matter exploded into a crisis where the State had to bear the blame.                          The problems of doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have never been a priority. In the early days of the virus, nurses were sent with only a cotton mask to examine potential coronavirus cases. Even after the pandemic declaration, health care workers have not received regular access to personal protective equipment (PPE), masks or gloves. They have been subjected to social ostracism, with some housing societies refusing to let them back even to claim their possessions.                          On May 6, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research called on the services of the city’s 25,000 licensed private doctors, saying all those under 55 would have to work for two weeks in COVID hospitals or lose their licence. The offer of insurance and payment for their time did little to lessen the anger at the diktat, but the BMC says 3,700 doctors have joined active duty and 570 of these doctors are reportedly willing to work in four of the dedicated jumbo COVID hospitals.                          Then the BMC turned its attention to private health care facilities. On May 19, they were threatened with criminal action if they failed to restart their hospitals, clinics or nursing homes. This was after they had been forced to close down just weeks earlier. The move was a precursor to demanding the reservation of 100 beds in private hospitals for coronavirus patients, including 10 ICU beds. On May 21, the BMC capped hospitalisation charges and took over 80 per cent of the beds in private hospitals. On May 25, Kerala was asked to send medical personnel for a 600-bed COVID hospital in Mumbai.                           More is yet to come. State Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta said initial projections saw 1.5 lakh cases by the end of May in the State. But on May 27, he said, “We won’t reach anywhere close to that number.” He said as on that date, “nearly 66 lakh people, or 6 per cent of the State population, have been screened by 16,000-plus squads”. He further said the doubling of cases had now gone up to 14 days.                           The monsoon will bring its share of seasonal ailments such as dengue and malaria. The curve is still rising and, by all accounts, the spike is expected around July.

Remember the turtle and the hare?          All right, it was actually a tortoise in the fable, but the lesson still applies.          Slow and steady wins the race.          That's something to remember this time of year when we see turtles slowly, slowly, slowly make their way across local roads in search of food and to nest.          They're coming off hibernation and in a hurry. That is, the turtle version of hurry.          MassWildlife recently issued its accustomed warning for motorists to keep on the lookout for the slow-steady creatures.          "From mid-May to early July, thousands of turtles throughout Massachusetts travel to new areas to find food and nest. You may find turtles on roadways, in your backyard, or other unexpected locations as they move across the landscape to find resources they need to survive."          These are important lessons to learn. But there's also a deeper lesson involved in seemingly suicidal turtle meanderings.          I learned a few years back around this time of year that the lesson involves the power of fate.          I was on a morning commute along a very busy two-lane, east-west highway.          The posted speed limits along this stretch ranged from 45 mph to 65 mph, which many motorists seem to view as the state's way of saying travel at least 70 mph.          Eighteen-wheeler trucks hauling everything from gravel to seafood rumbled along.          My attention was drawn to one of these jumbo trucks on this particular morning. It was approaching in the opposite direction.          And that's when I noticed the snapping turtle, slowly, slowly, slowly walking onto the highway with the obvious intention of crossing over to the other side - across both lanes.          You could have timed its progress with a sundial.          The traffic was so heavy here and the roadway so narrow that to pull over for a rescue would be dangerous to the would-be Good Samaritan, passing vehicles and the turtle, as well.          That is, if the snapper decided to docilely cooperate with rescue efforts, a behavioral response not to be expected in the species.          So why was the snapping turtle attempting to cross the road?          Yeah, yeah, to get to the other side, right. But at this time of year it was probably because she was a female looking for a sandy spot to lay her eggs.          This momma snapper (which I assumed her to be) was a fairly young one judging by the size - maybe 15 pounds. The path nature had predestined for her was extremely perilous.          I don't think even that speedy loud-mouthed hare could have made it across that road.          I drove on, already cringing at the gruesome sight I anticipated viewing on my return trip that evening.          I proceeded to work and soon forgot about the momma turtle and her march to oblivion.          It came back to me, of course, on the drive home as I approached the area where I'd spotted her that morning.          I didn't want to see the result of her bad fortune in picking a route, but I couldn't help looking.          But there were no grisly turtle remains to be seen.          I turned around and traveled back along the opposite route to make sure the reckless reptile's remains were not elsewhere.          Lo and don't behold.          No squished turtle.          So now we come to the lesson part:          Should we gather that fate is immutable, as in Greek tragedy?          Or that perseverance can conquer all, as in a morality play?          You make the call.          Of course, it could also mean that we really shouldn't read a whole lot into turtle behavior.          Because I doubt those hatchlings could have made it back across.          Courier & Sentinel Editor Frank Mulligan can be reached at fmulligan@wickedlocal.com

“The Gospel is the ongoing story of the Triune God redeeming broken and imperfect people through the cross and resurrection of Jesus and restoring them into the perfect and complete image of Jesus.”          I believe your lack of peace reveals the brokenness of our world. When God put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, there were no viruses. Threats like the coronavirus reveal how sin has affected all of God’s creation, including our emotional state. And I believe the death and resurrection of Jesus was God’s method to defeat the brokenness and begin restoring God’s Kingdom within us and around us.          Please hear me: I am not trying to dismiss any chemically- or biologically-based anxiety or depression you may be fighting. But what I am proposing is that for many of us, our lack of peace comes from keeping our eyes on the brokenness of the world around us and within us, rather than pondering the story of God’s plan to redeem and restore us from the sin that seeks to destroy us and our world.          The cross of Jesus reveals God’s love and His resurrection reveals God’s power. And if God can love us enough to send His One and Only Son to die for our sins AND has the power to raise Him from the dead, then God can love us through this pandemic and has the power to work through the pandemic.          So even though I know I am not in control, knowing God is in control brings me peace. As the Christian cliché declares, “I may not know what my future holds, but I know Who holds my future.”          If you find yourself with a lack of peace, may you look to the cross and the empty grave. Look to the Gospel, and let it remind you that God is in control, even when it doesn’t feel like it. And let this truth bring you a peace that surpasses understanding.

The Falkner football program has found its new head coach.          Pending board approval, Jeff Anglin has been hired to lead the Eagles. He comes to Falkner after serving as the defensive coordinator for three years at Biggersville. While on staff with the Lions, he also coached receivers for a year and offensive line for two years.          Before being at Biggersville, he spent six years at Ripley as an assistant defensive coach and he led the junior high team for five of those seasons. Before that, he had stints at Thrasher and Tishomingo County.          “I’ve sort of been itching about trying to move up for a while,” Anglin said. “I want to put my plan into play and see what I can do with the reins. You never know until you try. I consider myself a player’s coach, and I’ve always had a good relationship with players wherever I’ve been.”          Over the last three seasons, he helped lead Biggersville to a 30-8 record. In 2018, Biggersville made the playoffs for the first time in over 20 years, and in 2019, won its first division championship.          Anglin’s defense allowed 15.17 points per game in 2017, 12.64 ppg in 2018 and 14.08 in 2019.          Anglin will be the Eagles’ third football coach in as many years. He is replacing Ty Priest, who resigned in April. Falkner went 2-8 last season, 2-5 in Division 1-1A, and missed the playoffs.          Anglin is planning to meet his Falkner players on Thursday morning and will see what type of players he has before he decides what kind of offense he implements.          “I’m an old-school type of coach,” Anglin said. “Everyone says they have a playbook, and I do, but it really depends on what the kids are able to do. Time will tell what we are able to do with the kids we have. …”          “I’ve coached defense all of these years and learned the ins and outs of offenses, and I know what it takes to crack that wall or stop an offense. In a nutshell, if you’re a good defensive coach then you understand offense, and vice versa.”

A través de la disposición 3696/2020, la administración prohibió el uso y la comercialización en todo el territorio nacional, en todas sus presentaciones y contenidos netos del producto: «Lolet alcohol en gel- desinfectante para manos».      Según explicó el organismo “la firma LABORATORIO NEW ZEN SOCIEDAD RESPONSABILIDAD LIMITADA fue dado de baja y se señaló que “se verificó que el producto se encontraba inscripto a través del Sistema de Cosméticos grado 1 mediante tramite Nº 3845/2016, declarándose como elaborador contratado a la firma LABORATORIO SHE SOCIEDAD ANÓNIMA legajo Nº 2641, y como titular a Matías CERBINO”.

As if the coronavirus pandemic wasn't bad enough, forces are combining to reduce flying in the future because of its environmental impact. A growing number of university professors -- especially those involved in climate research -- had already been pushing back on flying. A single round-trip flight from Toronto to London has been calculated to roughly equal the CO2 emissions of an entire year of driving. That's for each of the passengers on board the plane. To many academics, that level of contribution to global warming was both unacceptable and hypocritical.

Residents sign a petition in support of the national security legislation at a street stand in Hong Kong, south China, May 29, 2020. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)                        US President Donald Trump's latest volley of threats at China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is unlikely to intimidate savvy businessmen into a withdrawal from the city, regional affairs watchers said.              Trump said last week that he would take "meaningful" action to eliminate Hong Kong's trade privileges under US law. Although most market watchers believe Trump's move is more bark than bite, his words suggest that Washington may consider imposing the same tariff rates on Hong Kong as in the Chinese mainland.              Results of a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong showed Wednesday that nearly half of the respondents voiced pessimism about the city's medium- to long-term outlook.              On a positive note, 70 percent of the respondents have no relocation plans. Those planning to move capital, assets or business operations are considering South America, Singapore, the US and other possible locations, according to the results.               Dong Shaopeng, a senior research fellow at the Changing Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, predicted that if the US canceled Hong Kong's special trade status, it would only backfire on US companies, some of which may consider moving directly into the Chinese mainland where markets are opening in a gradual manner.              "Hong Kong is an entrepot. Most American firms open offices in Hong Kong to tap into the Chinese mainland as well as Southeast Asian markets. If they retreat from Hong Kong to Singapore or back to the US, that will incur millions of dollars in losses. They will also be cut off from the world's fastest-rising market," Dong said.              For the US, Hong Kong is the third-largest wine export market, the fourth-largest beef product export market and the seventh-largest market for agricultural exports, media reports said.               "In the past decade, the US trade surplus with Hong Kong has been the biggest among all its trading partners, with a merchandise trade surplus totaling $297 billion from 2009 to 2018.               "In 2019, that surplus dropped from $31.4 billion in the preceding year to $26.4 billion as a result of US-China trade tensions," a spokesman for the HKSAR government said last week.              "Should any sanctions be contemplated in other areas like services and investment, the interests of the 1,300 US corporations based in Hong Kong will be shortcut," the spokesman added.              China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Thursday expressed steadfast support for Hong Kong's push to maintain its status as a separate customs territory.              The legal basis for Hong Kong's customs status derives from the WTO agreements and is confirmed by the Basic Law of the HKSAR as well as recognized by WTO members, said Gao Feng, a MOFCOM spokesperson.               "If the US turns a blind eye to basic principles in international relations and adopts unilateral measures [against Hong Kong] based on its domestic laws, [its move] would be a violation of WTO rules and not in the interests of the US," Gao noted.               If the US moves to control capital flows into and out of Hong Kong and demands that US firms withdraw from the city, international market sentiment regarding the city would inevitably take a hit. But meanwhile, such moves would deal a blow to the US, said Liang Haiming, chairman of Guangzhou-based China Silk Road Valley Research Institute.              Assets held by US financial institutions in Hong Kong total roughly $148 billion, according to Liang, adding that over 800 funds globally manage nearly $2 trillion in assets and about 25 percent of those assets are invested in Chinese shares, mostly Chinese stocks traded on the Hong Kong market. US pension funds are estimated to hold $250 billion worth of Chinese shares.              In a statement posted on its website on Thursday, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said that the just-approved national security legislation would help consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub and won't affect the legitimate rights of foreign investors in the city.               With a sound legal system, a stable financial regime, a massive number of financial professionals, solid economic fundamentals and a world-class business climate, the city holds $440 billion in foreign reserves and over HK$1 trillion ($129 billion) in fiscal reserves, rendering it fully capable of handling various risks and challenges, the CBIRC said, stressing that the city's financial market maintains stable operations and its Linked Exchange Rate System is well-founded.              A major business of many US financial institutions in the HKSAR is IPO underwriting for companies in the Chinese mainland that seek to list on the Hong Kong bourse, and that makes it hard for them to leave the market, industry insiders said.              "It has become a trend for more Chinese mainland-based companies to raise funds in Hong Kong amid the US crackdown. As the importance of Hong Kong rises in the capital market, US financial firms will stay. Otherwise, they will be severed from the market and lose competitiveness," a manager of the Hong Kong branch of a Beijing-based financial institution, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Global Times on Thursday.              The national security law will curtail anti-government forces and contribute to Hong Kong's stability, while cementing the rule of law and the HKSAR's position as a free trade port. "It will make the city a hot target for foreign investment in the long run," the manager added.              In the words of the banking and insurance regulator, there are no abnormal capital outflows and "Hong Kong's tomorrow will certainly be more beautiful."

It’s a lesson for all of us who read, teach, study and preach the Bible, while attempting to live according to its truths. The Bible may be “God’s Perfect Treasure of Truth,” but not one of us is a perfect interpreter of that truth. Truth is, the history of Christianity is replete with examples of those who, claiming to be absolutely right about the Bible, turned out to be terribly wrong about the gospel. Those who insist that biblical inerrancy is the only way to avoid the “slippery slope” of heresy had best reread Richard Furman’s “Exposition” and its “biblical” support for the slippery slope of slavery.

This is partly how she got her name, but it is also because of her adoption circumstances. Marucci found her when he was getting a tattoo on his shoulder. He saw the five-week-old kitten take a dive at a pit bull, and he was hooked.                  He adopted the brave kitten, her brother and her mother. The other two have since moved on, but Tattoo remains.                  “She’s worth her weight in gold when you have somebody in here that’s lost somebody,” Marucci said. “No matter where we’re working, she’s beside us.”                  She has also been known to make her rounds throughout the neighborhood, getting food from such places as the Manor Steakhouse and the Dove Center.                  Tattoo is good at rodent control throughout the cemetery. She also serves a purpose as an icebreaker when families come in to make arrangements.                  “She’s very, very friendly, likes everybody and has to be the center of attention,” Marucci said.                  The cat can come and go as she pleases through a special door in the garage, and also enjoys sitting on the warm bronze on the memorials in the cemetery. Every morning, she runs to greet Marucci when he arrives at the office.                  The cemetery has been in the family in Oakland for nearly 60 years. It was first started around 1959 by Cemetery Management Corporation, which had memorial parks throughout the tri-state area.                  At that time, Marucci’s father, Alfred “Blue” Marucci, ran Shorty’s, which was a grocery store, gas station and beer garden.                  “The two brothers who owned Cemetery Management Corporation stopped for a cold beer and a ham sandwich at Shorty’s,” Marucci said. “They convinced my dad he should go to work for them selling cemetery lots in Fairmont.”                  For the next several years, Blue Marucci traveled Route 50 each day to Fairmont, parked the car, and walked door-to-door selling cemetery lots.                  “My brother and sister would be in school, and he’d take Mom and I to the gas station first,” Marucci said. “Then he’d come back and we would go home while he stayed to close Shorty’s. Then he would come home and do it all over again the next day.”                  After about three years of that, Blue Marucci was able to purchase the cemetery. His son grew up in the business.

Another important consideration to bear in mind is that where someone has an event that inhibits their ability to perform their contractual obligation, they will need to look at the exact wordings of the contract to see if this was specifically provided for in the force majeure clause. Usually, the force majeure clause will list specific events. However, we often find broad and unambiguous language being used when drafting these clauses as so to capture a wide variety of instances.

The charges join the previous ones for Derek Chauvin, 44, the former officer who was seen with his knee firmly planted on the back of Floyd's neck. Chauvin's murder charge was also upgraded to second degree, and he faces a manslaughter charge as well. The three other officers -- Thomas Lane, 37; Tou Thao, 34; and J. Alexander Kueng, 26 -- face charges on on aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second degree manslaughter.

ATLANTA (AP) — In the wake of nationwide protests over police brutality, Georgia Tech wants to make sure its athletes take time to vote in November. The school said Thursday that nine teams, including football, will cancel all mandatory activities on Nov. 3 to recognize the importance of casting a ballot. Geoff Collins was one of the first Power Five football coaches to express his support for those protesting the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. That officer and three others present were fired and have since been charged in an incident that sparked widespread protests and rekindled the debate over the country’s injustice toward African Americans. “I need to find a way to lend my voice to what’s going on in the black community,” Collins, who is white, told reporters this week on a video conference call. “It matters to me. For far too long, I’ve been an internal guy, sending my thoughts and prayers and really seeing how this impacts guys on a daily basis my entire career. “It was on my heart to step out with a small statement, lend a small voice, share my voice and try to find a way to help the healing process, make this world a better place. I want to let my guys know and the black community as a whole know that your experience matters. You matter. Your hopes matter. Your dreams matter. Your life matters.\" Election Day comes four days before Georgia Tech’s football team is scheduled to host Duke. Other teams that pledged to refrain from any mandatory activities on Nov. 3 include men’s and women’s basketball, both of which will be preparing for the start of their seasons, along...

George Floyd was killed in 8 minutes and 46 seconds by a white police officer in Minneapolis on May 25.          His death has rocked the nation, leading to protests, riots, looting, political unrest and more as protesters have gone to the streets to bring awareness to what has been termed as a racially motivated killing of yet another black person by police.          Although the violent protests have been filling the news, what aren't being told are the stories of peaceful protests, prayer vigils and movements to bring awareness to Floyd's death and racism in the United States.          George Floyd, 46, was arrested by police after a local convenience store called in a possible purchase with counterfeit money. According to a New York Times report of the incident, Floyd lay unconscious on the street with Officer Derek Chauvin's knee pressed on the back of his neck. According to the report and video, Chauvin's knee did not move from Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds – the last minute even as paramedics were on the scene and onlookers were crying out for him to stop. Chauvin and three other officers were fired and are facing charges in the case.          In Northeast Kansas, there has been unrest concerning the incident, but also peaceful events. In Topeka, Kansas City, Lawrence and Manhattan, local media have told of protesters becoming agitated and violent, stores closing early and barricading windows and doors against possible looters. In some communities, however, there have been very powerful events in the name of George Floyd as local residents want to remember him and bring awareness in his name, but to do so without violence.          In Hiawatha, peaceful protesters lined the sidewalk in front of the Brown County Courthouse Sunday wearing medical masks and holding signs “Justice for George,” “Black Lives Matter” and “We Can't Breathe” - the last a reference to what onlookers say were George Floyd's last words “I can't breathe.”          Also in Hiawatha, a prayer vigil and peaceful protesting event “Hiawatha Believes Black Lives Matter” is set for Thursday evening around Korthanke Fountain, adjacent to the Hiawatha Police Department in downtown Hiawatha, starting at 5 p.m.          Community members were invited to join a prayer vigil “as our nation grapples with our history of systemic racism and its impact on our friends, family, and neighbors. Help us come together to mourn the experiences of BIPOC and pray to offer hope for equality for all.” according to the Facebook event post. As COVID-19 is still a threat, organizers recommend masks and maintaining social distancing. Speakers for the event include a prayer by Pastor Andrew Finch, comments by Brooke Grier, prayer by Shug Cadue and comments by Jason Thomas, both of the Kickapoo Tribe.          Other people have expressed their emotions through other ways. Cindy Kersenbrock Bicker, former art teacher with Hiawatha schools, is now teaching at Gardner Edgerton High School and also is an instructor at Lawrence Arts Center.          Earlier this week, she took her emotions to the canvas. Bicker, who is also a yoga instructor, said she painted a portrait of George Floyd in four hours, noting she did it as her meditation to help her cope with the horrible tragedy of his death.          While police have been the focus of many violent protests, local law enforcement want the community to know they support these local peaceful events and are outraged over the killing of George Floyd.          "I am excited for the prayer demonstration scheduled for tomorrow evening at our fountain. I plan to attend in support of my community," said Chief John Defore. "I have been a member of this community going on 8 years. My family has made this our home and as such we are proud to be a part of Hiawatha. Hiawatha is a progressive town with family values. Amiee and I have always felt welcome in this community. Our son married Morgan Ward and gave us a beautiful granddaughter that we plan to watch grow up here in Hiawatha."          Chief Defore said, as a police officer, he is saddened by all of the hate in our country.          "As a police department, we do our very best to fight crime in all its forms, but hate crimes of any form are exceptionally bad," he said. "Nobody likes a bully and all hate crimes are bullies acting out against others, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation or anything else. I was reminded today by someone that I respect very much, In God’s eyes we are all the same. "          On Saturday, an organization called Atchison United sponsored a “Justice For George” Unity Walk that started at LFM Park, circled through the Farmers Market, downtown Atchison and back to the park. There was a shorter route from LFM to Lincoln School for elders and those who could not walk long distances. One of the organizers, Sean Crittendon, said an estimated 200-300 people came out for the walk, drove behind them or met them en route to show support.          “This is a new organization that was born during and created after the walk for Amahad Arbery,” Crittendon said. Arbery was a 25-year-old black man killed in February in a south Georgia community after being chased down by white men, who were arrested just a few weeks ago. “We did not want to just come together as a community over tragedy, we wanted to create an organization where we could have constructive dialogue and create understanding regarding our differences and celebrate our commonalities,” he said. “We have a founding committee that created our mission, purpose, and focus. We now have opened things up to anyone that wants to join us.”          Saturday's event included speakers, prayer and the singing of “Amazing Grace," and as one participant noted together they celebrated diversity and commonality.           Also in Atchison, Atchison United youth held a demonstration Wednesday evening downtown at the police station. Police Chief Mike Wilson spoke, along with others, and the crowd knelt with more than 8 minutes. There were more than 100 in attendance.

Twenty-two years later, Mohler’s remarks resurfaced, prompting an interview about them with journalist Jonathan Merritt published last month by Religion News Service. To his credit, Mohler repudiated his earlier assertions. “It sounds like an incredibly stupid comment, and it was,” he told Merritt. “I fell into a trap I should have avoided, and I don’t stand by those comments. I repudiate the statements I made.”

Totuși, pentru această sărbătoare România și-a ales ziua națională la 1 decembrie 1918, fiindcă atunci s-a hotărât unirea de facto a Transilvaniei cu României. Pe 4 iunie 1920, Tratatul de la Trianon doar a confirmat juridic această situație. Între cele două momente istorice, Ungaria nu a recunoscut unirea, iar după acceptarea situației prin Tratat, politicienii Ungariei interbelice au considerat că la Trianon a fost vorba despre un dictat și au contestat felul în care a fost trasată frontiera dintre România și Ungaria. De altfel, Miklos Horty, fostul amiral austro-ungar, care devine regent al Ungariei și conduce țara de la 1 martie 1920 și până la 15 ocptombrie 1944 s-a aliniat statelor revizioniste, nemulțumite de aranjamentele de la finele Primului Război Mondial.

The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Thursday sought views of its member-lawyers on the resumption of regular courtroom proceedings in the court which has been holding virtual hearings since March 25 when the COVID-19-induced lockdown was imposed.          A three-judge panel, comprising Justices N.V. Ramana, Arun Mishra and U.U. Lalit, would review on Friday the functioning of the Supreme Court in light of the surging pandemic cases in Delhi and the adjoining area, and the views of the SCBA has been sought for on the issue.           The review meeting would take place amid rising demands from bar bodies, including the Bar Council of India and the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA), to resume physical courtroom hearings on various grounds including that the virtual court system was not working well in favour of many lawyers.          SCBA president and senior advocate Dushyant Dave asked the lawyers to give their response to seven questions which included whether they wanted regular court hearings to restart or not.
