The presidential election is creeping toward a Biden-Harris victory amid accusations that the Democrats have stolen the election.
 From all over the country, but especially in swing states, reports are coming to light about trashed mail-in ballots (interestingly, when found, almost always marked for President Donald Trump), ballots marked and mailed to election officials by non-citizens and dead people, ballots miscounted to give Joe Biden the edge in many key voting districts, "glitches" in ballot counting software that switch Trump votes to Biden, ballot totals far exceeding voter registration totals, and the like.
 These reports do not promote citizens’ confidence in our election system, and will further cause division and animosity between the left and right. We don’t know which of these reports is accurate, if any, but considering the viciousness of the constant daily unrelenting attacks over four years on a sitting President, including the impeachment based on a Democrat-fabricated, false "dossier," it is no wonder that we suspect these reports may well be true, as they would be right in character for the blue party.

All eyes were on this speedster named Jasprit Bumrah, who had played a stellar role in Gujarat's successful Vijay Hazare Trophy earlier that season. He bowled accurate lines and lengths, dismissing the run-machine Steve Smith as well. His unique action became a topic of heated discussion, but four years down the line this bowler has gone from strength to strength. Scrambled seam, yorkers and slower balls have laced Bumrah's whirlwind career so far, fetching him 68 and 108 wickets in Tests and ODIs respectively.

Even if a China expert like Lyle Goldstein were to be appointed to a top administration position, he would be a lone voice. The best to hope for in this situation is Blinken’s preferred mix of containment, and engagement. “China poses a growing challenge, arguably the biggest challenge, we face from another nation state: economically, technologically, militarily, even diplomatically,” he told CBS. “And, you know, the relationship has adversarial aspects, competitive aspects, but also cooperative ones.” At least the secretary of state is open to win-win scenarios.

To a lesser extent, the starting center position is not publicly settled, and Montrezl Harrell is a good deal more productive and has a higher salary than Marc Gasol, who is turning 36 this season. While Rob Pelinka described Harrell as “a terror and a beast to play against,” his game is oriented inside the paint, which crowds the floor offensively in lineups with Davis. Gasol, who has an outside shot and can move the ball adroitly around the court, looks on paper like a better fit in the starting lineup.

Sydney [Australia], December 6 (ANI): Pacer Mitchell Starc has withdrawn from the Australia T20I squad on compassionate grounds and will miss the remaining two games.   The left-handed bowler left the Australian team bio-bubble having been informed about a family illness and it hasn't been confirmed yet when he will rejoin the squad.   Australian Test squad is due to link up in Adelaide next week ahead of the pink ball match which gets underway on December 17.  
 "There is nothing in the world more important than family and in this case, Mitch is no exception," cricket.com.au quoted Australian men's team Head Coach Justin Langer as saying.   "We will give Mitch all the time he needs and welcome him back into the squad with open arms whenever he feels the time is right for him and his family," he added.   Earlier, star batsman David Warner and bowler Ashton Agar were ruled out with injury while pacer Pat Cummins was rested to prepare for the Test matches.   On Saturday, Nathan Lyon was added to the T20 squad. However, no replacement for Starc has been made given Andrew Tye and Daniel Sams are already in the side.   India made a winning start to the three-match T20I series as they beat Australia by 11 runs in the first T20I in Canberra on Friday. The second T20I between the two teams will be played at Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday. (ANI)

"We picked up what they were trying to do and adjusted our play calling a little better,'' Severin said. "We forced them into a passing game and they are not a passing team. Everybody stepped up and did a good job. The defense came to play.''
 The Tiger defense got a safety when Eskew was tackled in the end zone for a safety by Dylan Schlup in the fourth quarter. Timberlake had been stopped on the Buffalo one the series before.
 Timberlake's offense relied on the big play to separate themselves from the Bison.
 On the Tigers' second series, Jenlink hit Pippin on a screen pass on a third- and-long from the Timberlake 48. Pippin would out run the Bison defense to tie the score.
 Timberlake would go 51 yards on seven plays on its next series after forcing a Buffalo punt. Jenlink hit Judd on a 16-yard pass for the score and connected with Judd on the two-point conversion.
 Timberlake got a break on the next series when a bad snap on a punt gave the Tigers the ball on the Buffalo eight. Pippin would score on the first play to put Timberlake up 20-6.
 "That gave us some momentum,'' Severin said.
 Jenlink, with nine seconds left before half, connected with Judd from 69 yards out. He threw a two-point conversion pass to Colton Lormand off the swinging gate to make it 28-6.
 "We saw an opportunity there and Ethan did a good job,'' Severin said. "He put the ball right on the money. That was a big momentum gift for us.''
 After Schlup tackled Eskew for the safety, Judd returned the free kick to the Buffalo 36. Three plays later, Leirerer scored from 28 yards out. Jenlink hit Judd for the two-point conversion.
 "The safety gave us some more momentum,'' Severin said. "I was really proud of them.''
 Timberlake and Tyrone played last season in District C-1 play with the Tigers winning, 54-6.

After separating from her husband in 2007, Katie Marcoux and her two young daughters moved in with her parents for financial reasons. She expected to stay a year at most.
 Thirteen years later, Marcoux -- now remarried -- still lives in the house, along with her parents and one of her daughters.
 Such arrangements are increasingly common in the US, where one in five people now live in a "multigenerational" household, according to Pew Research Center.
 The phenomenon has been on the rise since the 1980s, when immigrant families arriving from Asia and Latin America tended to reside in households that ran the gamut in the age of residents.
 There was another rise starting around 2009 when the Great Recession brought the number of adults living in their childhood homes back to levels last seen in the 1950s.
 Now, with the upheaval of Covid-19, many are turning to the playbook again.
 \- New directions -
 When she moved in, Marcoux, now 49, was working part-time for the school system and "not in a very good financial position," she recalled.
 But living with her parents allowed Marcoux to maintain a part-time work schedule while raising her daughters, who were adjusting to new schools and their parents' divorce.
 She was assisted by mother Judy Kristensen.
 "When the girls were little, we were able to help Katie out by driving them places and stuff so she could work," Kristensen, 78, said.
 Meanwhile, Marcoux was able to progress professionally and now works full time.
 "One of the things that it has afforded me big time is a financial freedom that I was able to recover," said Marcoux.
 Eric Marcoux, husband to Katie, felt "very at home" with his in-laws, "so I sold my house and moved in," recalled the 47-year-old former cartographer, who brought his dog, Jazzman.
 Still, Marcoux, his wife and two stepdaughters, then teenagers, were forced to share one bathroom, an arrangement that "wasn't ideal," he said.
 The situation improved immeasurably after a home improvement project added a second master bedroom and another bathroom.
 Dana Scanlon, a real estate agent in the Washington region, said more young parents are taking a similar approach during the pandemic.
 "We have seen many couples with young children move in with their parents, into the large homes they grew up in -- something they never imagined they would do," Scanlon said.
 "This allows them the opportunity to have in-house babysitters or 'Zoom school supervisors' while they work from their laptops."
 \- Golden years -
 Another factor behind the shift has been the aging of the overall population, with many baby boomers still vigorous but looking ahead to a future when mobility will probably be more difficult.
 Marcoux's parents appreciate the buzz of company when many of their contemporaries rue their solitude and they don't expect to have an empty nest again.
 Staying with the parents is "definitely our plan," Marcoux said.
 "When we did the modifications to the house, we also redid their bathrooms so that it was more accessible for elderly."
 Marcoux has two older brothers in the area, "but it is just kind of an understanding that I will take care of them," she said.
 Marcoux's youngest daughter, Jenna, 19, moved to New York for college, but Eva, 20, is living in the home as she studies graphic design.
 "It really benefits me because at the end of the day I have a really strong support system," Eva said.
 The arrangement has also worked well for grandfather Dano, 80.
 "We have a very close relationship with all of our grandchildren," he said. "But it's special when they live with you."
 Richard Fry, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center, said there has been a "sharp rise" over the last decade in young adults living in multigenerational households.
 In 2016, the number of 25-29 year-olds living in such homes rose to 33 percent from 23 percent nine years earlier.
 A common challenge for millennials and other young Americans has been the burden of student loans.
 "Clearly what this reflects is that there's a segment of young adults who are simply having trouble earning enough to be able to live independently," Fry said.

INDIANAPOLIS — Coaches Mark Few of Gonzaga and Scott Drew of Baylor scheduled Saturday’s game for all the right seasons.
 They wanted their teams to have another early-season test and play in front of a national TV audience. The game on CBS between the nation’s top two college basketball teams figured to draw excellent ratings.
 For now, No. 1 vs. No. 2 is off.
 Less than 90 minutes before tip-off, the teams announced the postponement because of two positive COVID-19 tests in the top-ranked Bulldogs program. In a joint statement, the schools said one player and one nonplayer in the Gonzaga travel party tested positive. The unidentified player didn’t play Wednesday against No. 11 West Virginia.

When Chadwick Boseman died this past summer, we heard that he had one performance left in the can, a starring role in a film version of August Wilson’s Tony-winning play _Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom_. Last month, the word started to leak out that his performance was indeed great. I was skeptical, but only because I and everyone else wanted so much for that to be true. I was afraid that our grief over his early death might color our judgment. Then I saw the film in question, and from the first moment he appears on screen, you can tell that he has not been oversold. After playing so many heroes over the course of his short career, here he shows you what he’s like outside of that, moving with liquid grace and exuding sexuality, menace, and cocksuredness of a young man who knows exactly how good he is. While he did much the same when he played James Brown in _Get On Up_ , this is a better turn, because it’s in a movie that’s worthy of it. Amid this cursed pandemic, _Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom_ opens this week in the Cinemark Theatres in Mansfield and North East Mall before it comes to Netflix. If you want to say farewell to this actor at the cineplex, you can, and it will be worth it.

Vasco (Goa) [India], December 6 (ANI): After suffering a defeat at the hands of NorthEast United FC, SC East Bengal head coach Robbie Fowler said it was his side's 'worst performance' so far in this season but is confident that they will get things right.   NorthEast United FC continued their strong start to Indian Super League (ISL) 2020-21 with a 2-0 victory over SC East Bengal at the Tilak Maidan Stadium in Vasco on Saturday.   "It is when you have lost a couple of games. Tonight was our worst performance in terms of the games we have played so far. But we still should have won the game. We know that we have got something to work with. We have lacked a little bit in the final third but we will get it right," Fowler said in the post- match press conference.  
 With three defeats in three games, SC East Bengal are the only side that is yet to open their account in ISL 2020-21. Fowler said they are 'massively disappointed' with the result.   "We are massively disappointed with the result, but we can take something out of the match. We played okay but we lost the game so that's all that matters," Fowler said.   Despite an unfavourable result, the Englishman spoke highly of midfielder Sehnaj Singh, who made his first start for SC East Bengal. "Sehnaj played very well. We know what type of a player he is and we just wanted to see him playing in that position. He put in a performance that he can be proud of," he said. (ANI)
