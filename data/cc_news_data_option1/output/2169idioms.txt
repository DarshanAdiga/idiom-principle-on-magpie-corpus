Firms that help Hong Kong residents apply for British visas have seen a surge in interest. One firm, British Connections, said that 120 people had applied for British travel documents between May 22 and May 31, compared with 67 in the same period last year.
 Hong Kong residents have also explored other options, including Canada, Australia and Ireland. Those departures could deprive the city of talent and embarrass Beijing to boot, which is perhaps why China reacted furiously to Britain’s announcement.
 “All Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals,” Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said at a news conference, adding that China could take unspecified countermeasures.
 China’s response has suggested Beijing is willing to sacrifice Hong Kong to get its way. Other Chinese cities, like Shanghai and Shenzhen, have pledged to make investor-friendly legal and financial reforms to fight for Hong Kong’s business. The resort island of Hainan has promised to turn itself into a free trade port like Hong Kong.
 More broadly, China sees the risk as limited.
 In the face of Trump’s threat, for example, China is calculating that he is bluffing. U.S. business interests in Hong Kong are extensive. If the White House took the more dramatic route of limiting Hong Kong’s access to U.S. dollars, Chinese banks have other ways to access the global financial system, said Victor Shih, an expert on the Chinese financial system at the University of California, San Diego.
 China also holds more than $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury bills, which accounts for more than 4% of the U.S.’ total debt. While China cannot quickly sell that debt without making major problems for itself, such a move could cause disruptions globally.
 Chinese officials also believe that Hong Kong’s business elite, historically a moderating force on Beijing, has been successfully persuaded or pressed to go along. Many have extensive business holdings in the mainland.
 “We probably need not overinterpret it,” Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest man, said of the law in a statement.
 Some of Hong Kong’s biggest investors contend that business will continue as usual.

“Well I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country,” Brees said. "Let me just tell you what I see or what I feel when the national anthem is played and when I look at the flag of the United States. I envision my two grandfathers who fought for this country during World War II — one in the Army and one in the Marine Corps. Both risking their lives to protect our country and to try to make our country and this world a better place. So every time I stand with my hand over my heart, looking at that flag and singing the national anthem, that’s what I think about. And in many cases, it brings me to tears thinking about all that has been sacrificed. Not just those in the military, but for that matter, those throughout the civil rights movements of the ’60s and all that has been endured by so many people up until this point. And is everything right with our country right now? No, it’s not. We still have a long way to go, but I think what you do by standing there and showing respect to the flag with your hand over your heart is it shows unity, it shows that we are all in this together, we can all do better, and we are all part of the solution."

RENTON, Wash. (AP) — Speaking to the media for the first time since the end of last season, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson didn't care to talk about the game that’s helped make him famous. “To be honest with you, I don’t even want to talk about football right now,” Wilson said during a video conference Wednesday. “You know, that’s a thing that I don’t even know what that looks like down the road or anything else. I think that none of that matters. I can’t compare football to life and what the black community is going through right now.” Wilson’s 35-minute session was as emotional as he’s been in any formal media setting during his eight previous seasons in Seattle. He relayed stories from his youth in Richmond, Virginia, and about raising two kids now with a third on the way. At times in the past, the conversation with Wilson may have centered on offseason changes to Seattle’s offense and whether Wilson has enough weapons for the Seahawks to contend in a challenging NFC West. But Wilson didn’t want to talk Xs and Os, personnel changes or even the strange virtual offseason. His tone was similar to how Seattle has run its team meetings since last week following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the nationwide protests that have followed. A white police officer has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed. Prosecutors on Wednesday expanded their case against the officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death, charging three of the officers with aiding and abetting a murder and upgrading the charges against the officer who pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck. “A guy was murdered last week. There needs to be a change. There needs to be a change. It’s not overly...

By 1892, commercial fishing for white sturgeon had peaked, with a harvest of nearly 5.5 million pounds, according to a 2011 report released by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. By 1899, regulations were introduced — a minimum size limit, a four-month fishing season. But it was too late; the fishery collapsed. Just seven years after the peak, less than 75,000 pounds of sturgeon were harvested.
 Just a few decades later, in the early 1930s, construction began on the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams. In 1975, the last major dams in the basin were completed.
 Today, the Columbia River is more a chain of reservoirs, a reverse archipelago. Nearly half of the hydropower electricity generated in the United States comes from more than 270 hydropower dams that segment the river and its tributaries. The Bonneville Lock & Dam alone generates enough electricity to power about 900,000 homes, or a city the size of San Francisco.
 Irrigation canals spider out from the reservoirs into the fertile Yakima Valley, watering grapes for wine and hops for beer. Much of the food grown in the basin — Idaho wheat and potatoes, Washington apples — is then loaded onto boats and shipped down the river, lock by lock, to the Pacific Ocean.
 Of all the fish imperiled by the dams, salmon have received the most attention and protection. Before 1850, experts believe, up to 16 million salmon and steelhead trout returned to spawn each year in the Columbia River basin, according to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. This year, the Idaho, Oregon, and Washington fish and wildlife agencies predict only 1.2 million fish will return.
 For decades, experts have tried to stem the decline with fish ladders, which allow the salmon to swim upstream to spawn. But $16 billion worth of recovery efforts have not stopped the loss, and salmon numbers remain troublingly low.
 The funds have not helped the sturgeon, either, as the large fish cannot always climb the ladders built for salmon. As a result, different sturgeon populations are walled off from one another, which limits genetic diversity.
 Dams also slow the flow of the river, endangering babies. Once, eggs were dispersed over miles, tumbling in the currents. Now, they clump together in the slow-moving water, an easy snack for predators.
 Spiritually, many members of the Yakama Nation are committed to protecting the river system. From creation stories to contemporary struggles over fishing rights, the nation’s identity is intimately linked to the health of the ecosystem.
 “If they disappear, we will disappear,” said Gerald Lewis, the chairman of the Fish and Wildlife Committee of the Yakama Nation Tribal Council. “We’re pretty much tied together.”
 Miller carries this philosophy with her. She was born into a community where disputes raged over treaty fishing rights. Her mother remembers playing on the rocks as Miller’s grandfather fished for sturgeon at the now-submerged Celilo Falls.
 As an adult, Miller earned a degree in fisheries resources at the University of Idaho. She spent time working in other tribal, state and commercial hatcheries along the basin, juggling her work in conservation with the responsibilities of caring for her family.

“There is a need for collaboration, team building, common business cultures and a continuous desire to have social contact within a business,” O’Donnell said.
 The building is 80% leased ahead of its August opening. One tenant signed for 40,000 square feet of office space at the height of the lockdown, which O’Donnell took as an encouraging sign.
 The building is already being adjusted to meet post-pandemic needs, something O’Donnell said newer structures were better able to do. Amenities are being updated to be touch-free. And owners are talking with tenants about walk- through thermal imaging to monitor workers and visitors for fevers.
 The pandemic will result in a demand for more office space, not less, said Paul H. Layne, chief executive of the Howard Hughes Corp., a national commercial real estate developer based in Houston. Developers will move away from the industry-standard 125 square feet per person toward roomier workplaces.
 But others say it is too early to tell when demand for office space will return. Jamil Alam, managing principal of Endeavor Real Estate Group, said the situation would vary by city.
 “There will be winners and losers,” Alam said, explaining that he thinks denser metro areas like New York and Boston, which have been ravaged by the coronavirus, could find their luster lost in favor of smaller markets.
 Endeavor, which is based in Austin, Texas, has a portfolio that includes 15.6 million square feet of commercial real estate in cities like Dallas, Denver and Nashville. One of its projects, the 20-story Gulch Union, will be the largest office tower in Nashville when it opens in August with 324,254 square feet of office space.
 Smaller markets like Nashville are well-positioned for companies wishing to pull up stakes from major metropolitan areas with higher density and costs, Alam said. Gulch Union has leased 27,000 square feet, and four more deals totaling 40,000 square feet are near completion.
 “Deals are still being done,” he said.
 There will be an appetite for urban, walkable, mixed-use office environments, Alam said, and changes will need to be made in buildings over time, like fewer touch points on handles and elevator buttons.
 But projects that have not been started yet will be paused, said Chris Kirk, managing principal of the Salt Lake City office of Colliers, the commercial real estate brokerage firm.
 “If you are a developer or landlord or CFO, you are concerned,” he said. “Everyone is feeling the impact.”
 Salt Lake City is in a better position to weather the crisis than other markets, he added, because Utah has had fewer coronavirus cases than most states and has not been under a statewide lockdown.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Wednesday he opposes using military forces for law enforcement in containing current street protests, tamping down threats from President Donald Trump, who had warned states he was willing to send troops to "dominate" the streets.
 Less than 48 hours after the president threatened to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to contain protests if governors were not able to get a handle on unrest, Esper said it should be invoked in the United States "only in the most urgent and dire of situations." He declared, "We are not in one of those situations now."
 Esper, at Trump's encouragement, had already authorized the movement of about 1,300 active-duty Army units to military bases just outside the nation's capital, but they have not entered the city — and defense officials said some of the troops were beginning to return to their home bases Wednesday.
 White House officials indicated even before Esper's comments that Trump was backing away from invoking the Insurrection Act. At the same time, the president was taking credit for the deployment of federal and other law enforcement officers to the nation's capital, saying it offered a model to states on how to stop violence accompanying some protests nationwide.
 Trump argued that the massive show of force was responsible for protests in Washington and other cities turning more calm in recent days and repeated his criticism of governors who have not deployed their National Guard to the fullest.
 "You have to have a dominant force," Trump told Fox New Radio on Wednesday. "We need law and order."
 Esper, in his Pentagon remarks, strongly criticized the actions of the Minneapolis police for the incident last week that ignited the protests. In their custody, a black man, George Floyd, died after a white officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck for several minutes. Esper called the act "murder" and "a horrible crime."
 Esper himself has come under fire from critics, including retired senior military officers, for having walked from the White House on Monday evening with Trump and others for a presidential photo opportunity in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, which had previously sustained damage from protesters.
 Esper said that while he was aware they were heading to St. John's, he did not know what would happen there.
 "I was not aware a photo op was happening," he said, adding that he also did not know that police had forcibly moved peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square to clear the way for Trump and his entourage.
 Trump put a political spin on his criticism of states with violence. He said, "You notice that all of these places that have problems, they're not run by Republicans. They're run by liberal Democrats."
 The Defense Department has drafted contingency plans for deploying active-duty military if needed. Pentagon documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed plans for soldiers from an Army division to protect the White House and other federal buildings if the security situation in the nation's capital were to deteriorate and the National Guard could not secure the facilities.
 But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters' First Amendment rights.
 The situation in Washington had escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump's policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls.
 The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had gone to the White House bunker during Friday's protests.
 In a Monday address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence to tamp down the protests. If they didn't, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history.
 On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They were stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, were on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to documents reviewed by the AP.
 Administration officials were privately acknowledging that Monday's events didn't serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said Trump had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church.
 "There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police," said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. "But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop."
 Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, "I just wish he opened it once in a while."
 It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene. He verbally gave the order at that time.

3. Keeping this in mind, the superficial ground movements by the Indians are simply a cover for the real _casus belli,_ which is actually to scuttle the CPEC thus denying China a strategic advantage and at the same time benefiting the United States by forcing the Malacca Straits to remain relevant. The rewards for India appear tempting, i.e. regional dominance, containing Chinese super power status, getting international recognition as a world class player leading to a permanent seat to the Security Council with US support.  
     4. In my reckoning, the Indians have made a serious miscalculation and a strategic blunder. First they have forfeited the offices of the UN and the Security Council by their own unilateral actions of abrogating Article 370 and their continual violations of the UN Resolutions on Kashmir. Will the Indians now address it as an internal matter? It is now a bilateral issue as the Indians love to address Indo-Pak disputes; maybe even a trilateral one now.   Secondly, the Indians have lost a high moral ground and the Chinese appear to be responding to an Indian initiative of constantly creeping ahead with their activity and disregarding UN Resolutions.   Thirdly, if the Indians try to respond to the Chinese intrusion, they are likely to be thoroughly exposed to be what they are - an antiquated force with grand visions.   Fourth, this will give a fillip to the internal resistance in Kashmir and finally it will strengthen Pakistan's position on CPEC and Kashmir.  
     5. What is likely to happen is that India will try to find a narrative where they can diffuse the situation but the ground situation will not change. The Chinese will not return territory. That would mean that the Karakoram Pass would always be under threat and a link up with Pakistani troops and the Chinese at Kargil would be a real possibility for all times to come. This ground reality, as it exists now, allows for the only place where a Chinese and Pakistani military collusion is possible. If such a collision ever comes to pass, it will open the Srinagar Valley to Pakistan and totally cut off Siachen from India. This probability will remain a huge Indian vulnerability, forcing them to address it thus consuming resource and manpower. India would have to back down and negotiate a more permanent and lasting three-way solution to Kashmir or else address the matter militarily. The latter is not likely. So the situation is likely to diffuse and lead to a negotiated settlement. A lot of facesaving narratives will be forthcoming, new diplomatic initiatives by the Indians and the smiling Buddha radiating peace may be the line that will be taken by the Indians but not war. There maybe some saber-rattling, troop build-up and concentration of force with some brinkmanship, but probably nothing more. Nevertheless, in the event political rhetoric and aggressive posturing do force Indian Armed Forces into a reluctant military adventure, India would be terribly exposed. India, trying to live beyond its potential with illusions of grandeur, trying to see itself as a legitimate challenge to China as a regional power would be a theory permanently put to rest after any such physical conflict.  
     6. This is a revolutionary development with far reaching consequences. In the realms of international power projection, nations must always live within the limits of their potential. If they try and go beyond their own capacity, the world will clip their wings to size. This is a natural phenomenon. India has been suffering from grandeur illusions based upon a self-inflicted exaggerated opinion of itself. It has even managed to sell this image through song and dance and sell it well. However, such falsities are easily exposed in time and the fall is usually not only terrible but it has unintended consequences.
