Because even though three of them are captains, and the other four are commanders (and of those four, one is ready for command and the other was until very recently a first officer of a starship), they're all being assigned to the same ship in the same positions they were in two (or more) rank grades ago. Because that totally makes sense. (It makes no kind of sense.)

As Negan leads Alpha to a shack where Lydia is kept prisoner, Alpha reveals that she believes it is her destiny to kill her daughter. Once the gruesome deed is done, Alpha can die and pass on her leadership to Negan. "I want you to become a lion" she tells him. Negan actively tries to dissuade Alpha from her plan by detailing his wife's losing battle with cancer. "When she was gone, I didn't feel much anymore…that was my strength," he admits. But he accuses Alpha of being a pretender, that it is impossible for humans to act like animals with no emotions. "You still love her" he begs. But Alpha is sticking to her "destiny" schtick, even implying that it was Lucille's destiny to die from cancer and be "set free." They reach the shack and Alpha opens the door, ready to make Lydia a permanent member of the undead. But Lydia is not kept there. A confused Alpha turns around as Negan quickly slashes her throat. He gently kisses her goodbye as Alpha chokes and gasps her last breath.

The falls on share markets come as investors worry that the world's biggest central banks may now have very little ammunition left to deal with the effects of the coronavirus if the global economic climate continues to worsen.


  "They pulled out whatever weapons they had and my sense is I think it may help initially but I don't think it goes much further because this is still a developing issue. They used up basically all their ammunition and we're down to sticks and stones," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Slatestone Wealth.


  Earlier the US Federal Reserve cut its interest rates by 100 basis points to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would offer at least $700bn for support to the markets in the coming weeks.


  Speaking after the announcement Fed chairman Jerome Powell said "The virus is having a profound effect."


  Alongside the Fed, five other central banks - the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank - also announced measures to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets.


  The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay for US dollars, which has surged in recent weeks.


  New Zealand's central bank also lowered interest rates by 75 basis points as it prepared for a "significant" hit to the economy.


  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Adrian Orr said the virus was expected to have a severe impact on the economy over the coming year.

I am quite disappointed with the performance of our South South zone and to be honest, the inability of our leadership to bring the benefits of democracy to our people. If it is not one fight, it’s another. A struggle for supremacy, a competition for villa access or key leaders getting in each other’s way. As a result of this, we have suffered a mixture of intra and inter state disharmony which has left us in one case, without candidates in a whole state, in another - losing a governor elect while in Edo State, a National Chairman and a Governor are in open warfare. This alone calls for drastic change at the highest level and for those of us that know who did what and when, the buck stops at the table of the suspended National Chairman. For us to make progress, he has to step aside. Even then, the leaders have to sit down and get their acts together. Enough is enough. We have a President who can move mountains for us if we sing from the same hymn sheet, but instead we are self isolating like coronavirus suspects. The rank and file are not happy with the leadership and if it continues like this, they will make life very uncomfortable.

  Over the last four years, we’ve seen the Trudeau government continuously weaponize critical topics for political gain. These include racism, inequality, same-sex rights, indigenous relations, and climate change.


  At the same time, we have begun to see a simple but worrying pattern. While the Liberals never hesitate to demonize those around them, they continuously fall short of expectations.


  Reconciliation with indigenous peoples? In theory, sure. But the government will still take children to court because $40,000 in compensation for a lifetime of abuse is, perhaps, “asking for more than we are able to give right now.”

Northfield Public Schools announced Sunday it would not immediately begin e-learning days on Wednesday after Gov. Tim Walz announced all public schools would close from at least Wednesday to March 27 due to the coronavirus pandemic.


  Northfield Superintendent Matt Hillmann said the district is planning the closure with Prairie Creek Charter, Arcadia Charter and St. Dominic Elementary schools. Those schools will also close Wednesday.


  Families may opt to keep their students at home, and that would be an excused absence. The district advised families inform them if they do so.


  After school continues Monday and Tuesday, there will be no school or e-learning days for Northfield Public Schools students Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Afterschool activities, practices, events and building rentals are canceled beginning Monday until at least March 30, including Community Education programs.


  "This is an adaptation of our e-learning plan based on this emergency situation and it will allow teachers time to prepare longer-term online learning approaches should school closures extend beyond this initial period," the district stated.


  Students will be able to check out as many school library books as they would like during the closure and over spring break. Students in grades 3-5 are expected to bring school iPads home on Tuesday and will receive additional instructions from the district. KidVentures and EarlyVentures will use a regular schedule Monday and Tuesday and will not be available between March 18 and March 30. Students with a need can access free meals Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. The district will provide detailed information about available food service Monday.


  Child care for parents who are health care workers or emergency workers will be provided.


  "Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to provide additional services to families in other professions," the district states. More information on child care services will be available Monday.


  Charter Spectrum is providing free access to families impacted by school closures during the period. Families are advised to contact spectrum.com/browse/content/spectrum-internet-assist.


  Walz ordered public schools to temporarily close to provide administrators and teachers time to plan to switch to distance learning as the number of people with COVID-19 increases, while health officials confirmed the state’s first cases of community transmission.


  Minnesota’s case total rose to at least 35 Sunday, up 14 from Saturday. They included three cases of community transmission, in which the patients had no recent travel outside of Minnesota and no known exposure to an infected person.


  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover within weeks.


  The district is compensating regularly scheduled employees for lost time due to the closure. The National Association of School Psychologists has prepared guidance for parents to speak with their children about COVID-19.


  This is a developing story. Look to the News for more information Sunday night.

OTTAWA -- After three decades in the industry, a Franklin County native has brought her barbering savvy to a historic shop on Ottawa's Main Street.


   


  "It sometimes throws people off, me being a female barber," said Leisa Price. "When I took the shop over, there were some clientele who were skeptical. I think I've won them over."


   


  Price is the owner/operator of Cut-N-Up Barber Shop, 411 S. Main St. in Ottawa. A Williamsburg native, Price bought the shop -- formerly known as Palace Barbershop -- in July.


   


  "I have a barbershop in Garnett. I've had that barbershop for eight years and I still run it," Price said. "I go down there three days of the week, and I'm here the rest of the time.


   


  "I love getting to be a part of the growth in downtown Ottawa. I see new business is coming in and I hope that it continues."


   


  Price is excited to write the next chapter in her establishment's history, which goes back decades.


   


  "It goes back to the '50s and even earlier; I haven't been able to find a confirmed date," she said. "We have an obituary displayed of a guy who used to shine shoes in the shop. I like the old, nostalgic barbershop feel."


   


  Price's own experience in the barbering industry also goes back decades, to a time when she "stumbled" into the profession.


   


  Price's mother decided to go to barber school but didn't want to go through the program alone.


   


  "I hated what I was doing at the time, and she said 'Would you go with me?' " Price said. "I said, 'Sure, let's do it.' "


   


  Price graduated barber school in 1988 and was immediately recruited to work at what is now Amyx Barber Shop North on Massachusetts Street in Lawrence.


   


  "I was the only the second woman ever to work at that barbershop, and I had a terrible time getting these guys to sit in my chair," she said. "I would get so frustrated. The guys would be busy, and we would have people lined up, and I will be sitting there with an empty chair. I felt so embarrassed."


   


  Price wouldn't give up, though.


   


  "Finally, I bought this old-fashioned, button-up-the-sides, banded-collar white barber smock, like Floyd the barber in 'The Andy Griffith Show,' " she said. "I wore that thing every single day for a year solid. I hated it, but it worked. People started sitting in my chair."


   


  Price's persistence over her extensive career has yielded what she sees as the best part of her occupation.


   


  "I get to see people's transformations," she said. "Especially folks that get a more significant change -- when that person gets complimented, they feel better about themselves, and I love that -- that's probably the most rewarding part."

Nine months after 20 Democratic candidates gathered for the first debate of the 2020 primary season, it has come down to two candidates - Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.


  Given the circumstances, one might expect a sombre mood with respectful disagreements. Instead it was an at-times feisty affair, with Sanders going on the attack in a way he never did four years ago in his unsuccessful presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton.


  If the Bernie revolution is on the ropes, the candidate - who just a few weeks ago was considered the front-runner - isn't going to go down without a fight.


  Both candidates discussed the personal steps that they - as at-risk elderly individuals - were taking to avoid contracting the coronavirus, including limiting their public contacts, having their staff work remotely and holding online rallies and forums.


  Both septuagenarian candidates also had a few flubs. Biden referred to the 2009 swine flu as N1HI, not H1N1. Sanders at one point repeatedly referred to coronavirus as "Ebola".

As Major League Baseball figures out how to best handle the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the league issued a memo to all 30 teams Sunday with updated guidelines that includes a strong recommendation to stop organized team workouts and practice social distancing.


  “The risk of a player in a club facility contracting the virus is real, and we must implement protocols to protect the safety and well-being of our players and staff members,” the league memo, which was shared by The Athletic’s Evan Drellich, says. “In addition, we must recognize that there is the potential for further federal and state restrictions that will impact our operations, including restrictions on travel.”


  The memo came Sunday as a Yankees minor leaguer reportedly tested positive for coronavirus, the first known case in baseball. The Yankees said that player, whose name was not released, has been reporting only to the team’s minor league’s facility and has not been in contact with anyone in its major league facility.


  MLB suspended all league operations last Thursday, following the lead of several other sports leagues in the wake of the pandemic. On Friday, MLB and the players association agreed to allow major league players to return home, stay in their spring training cities, where facilities remained open or return to their team’s home city.


  The memo issued Sunday said 40-man roster players must still be allowed to stay at their team’s spring training site, “but we anticipate that may change in the coming days as events continue to unfold and players become better educated about current conditions.”


  It’s unclear how many Red Sox players have chosen to stay at their spring training camp site in Fort Myers, where they’re allowed to report to the facility and conduct individual workouts, but the team said Friday it would make those accommodations as safe as possible.


  “For players who want to stay here, we will have the facility available to them if they want to stay here and obviously we’re going to continue and intensify all the precautions taken to make sure this is a clean and safe environment for everybody here,” Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom said on a conference call. “We’re all adjusting on the fly here as we learn more about what this means for the country and what it means for our industry.”


  All non-roster players, however, were recommended to return home to their offseason residences, according to the memo. The clubs were told to work with the players to find suitable accommodations if leaving wasn’t feasible.


  MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred is expected to hold a conference call with all 30 teams at noon on Monday.

Minnesota Timberwolves big man Karl-Anthony Towns on Sunday announced he is donating $100,000 to the Mayo Clinic to help with improving and making more abundant tests for COVID-19, the strain of coronavirus that has led to a global pandemic.
 Towns, 24, is the latest NBA star to donate money to a cause related to coronavirus, as virtually all of the sports world is on pause for at least the next two weeks -- and likely much longer. Kevin Love, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Blake Griffin and Zion Williamson are among the players donating money to help pay arena employees' wages during the stoppage in play.
 The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is one of the nation's leading centers in disease research and is the largest employer and health care provider in Minnesota.

This is not to suggest that none of the above are currently in the works. Each and every day, new information emerges about the virus and what people are doing for the national response. When there isn’t an emergency, certain kinds of surprises can be nice such as an unexpected cake or a little extra avocado on the toast. However, during a public health emergency, minimizing surprises, even good ones, is important. Think of the country as gigantic basketball team, with over 327 million people on the court against an even bigger team of viruses. Even if you make the nicest pass, it won’t help if your teammate isn’t looking for the pass and gets bopped in the face instead.

Whether it’s the destruction of freedom in Hong Kong, holding Canadians hostage, putting millions of Uighurs in concentration camps, forced organ harvesting, or the Orwellian surveillance state, Canadians are looking at China and seeing a country that simply doesn’t share our values, and is in many ways hostile to Canada itself.
 There was a time when someone like Brian Bowman could have gotten away with his fawning Tweet, but that time has passed. Sooner or later, Canada’s elites will be forced to realize that they can’t hide the truth about China’s government, and they can’t suppress the real views of Canadians.
 The pressure is mounting for a tougher approach to China, for reducing our reliance on China, and to move towards a political and economic decoupling from the ruthless communist State. Whether it starts happening now or down the road, the demands of the Canadian People will be translated into policy one way or another.

Ok. We are looking at two separate issues which are the cause and affect of each other. The first is the coronavirus which is impacting and will impact the global economy, resulting in negative growth across the board. Nigeria is no exception. Current forecasts put our expected growth rate to hit 2 per cent as opposed to the 2.5 per cent earlier predicted. The second issue is the Saudi - Russia crude cuts debate and the impact of a crude war. That sent the price stumbling. But Russia has since indicated a willingness to talk so the oil price is recovering slowly again. It’s important not to panic. Oil prices will go above our estimated oil price of $57, but it may take a while for that to happen and we are losing time. The government will be under pressure to devalue the Naira, but it shouldn’t subscribe to knee jerk reactions. One month from now, things will be a lot clearer. In the meantime, our handling of the coronavirus issue is our biggest currency.

The Liberals have already been moving in a more and more dangerous direction. Their $600 million media bailout was a clear effort to make a large portion of the media subservient to the state. Then, with Unifor head Jerry Dias—who represents thousands of unionized journalists—taking an active partisan role in the election, the line between the government and the media blurred even further.
 And now, with the Liberals pushing for media to register, that line risks being erased entirely. As a result of this growing threat to Canadian freedom, everyone who values the free press must stand up and be counted.

School officials at Pinkerton Academy in Derry and Chester Academy in Chester sent notices to families of students this weekend reporting incidents involving potential exposure to coronavirus at both schools.


  Officials at Pinkerton Academy reported Sunday an individual from “our daily school community” tested positive for COVID-19, while Chester Academy officials warned of possible COVID-19 exposure to young children involved in the YMCA aftercare program.


  According to a notice sent by Pinkerton Academy headmaster Tim Powers, officials with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) notified the school Sunday the department is conducting a contact investigation to identify anyone who may have come in close contact with the infected person.


  “This individual has not been on campus since Tuesday, and we anticipate the exposure has


  been limited,” writes Powers. “However, this is the time period when symptoms might start showing for those who might have had close contact which is defined as several minutes of face to face interaction. Please monitor your students for symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and chills.”


  Any person who is identified as a close contact to this person will be notified directly by DHHS. Anyone who is not directly notified is considered at low risk and should monitor (self-observe) their health for fever or respiratory illness.


  “At this time, this is the only information we are able to share,” writes Powers. “While we understand this will heighten concerns in the community, we ask that you refrain from speculation and rumors. Instead, let us rely on each other to respond to this latest challenge. Please remember to keep us informed regarding the health of your students. It will take the cooperation of us all to get through this.”


  Also on Sunday, SAU 82 Supt. Darrell Lockwood posted a notice on the Chester Academy website saying he was notified by state authorities that the individual who had contact with the YMCA aftercare program last week has tested positive for COVID-19. DHHS has requested contact information for parents of children who attended the program on Monday 3/9 and/or Tuesday 3/10.


  “We will work with the YMCA program to provide this information based upon their attendance sheet,” wrote Lockwood. “The NH DHHS will be contacting those parents directly. They have requested that parents keep children who attended the program on these dates at home until they make contact with you. It is times like these that challenge our ability to remain strong and positive. However, our response must be one of collaboration and cooperation as we navigate and respond to the challenges before us. We will need each other as we move forward.”


  Anyone with questions or concerns is asked to contact their healthcare provider or DHHS at 2-1-1.

 The rule of law is one of the most important legal principles on which Canada is based. Along with the supremacy of God, it is mentioned in the very first words of the _Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms_ : “Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law.”
 The rule of law means that we are ruled by laws, not by the whims of a King, or the clamouring of a mob. The rule of law also means that the law applies to everyone, even the King; there can be no exemptions for the King or his favourites.
 Countries which practice and uphold the rule of law tend to thrive economically, socially, politically and culturally. Countries which uphold the rule of law become wealthy because people can work, buy, sell and trade in the knowledge that their property and their person are protected by law. Economies thrive when people know that the law will be enforced, and that the law will be applied to everyone, even to the King and his favourites. The rule of law provides investors, foreign and domestic, with confidence to invest their money in business projects.

 It is a well-known fact that the moment one steps out of line in their social group, consequences will inevitably occur.
 However, in this age of social media, coupled with an increasingly aggressive progressive politics, “stepping out of line” now simply means speaking realities and truths that cause the slightest discomfort to the “group.” Consequences can often be dire.
 Without question, a modern social line that is absolutely not to be crossed is that of sex and gender. Anything from expressing concerns about the safety and future of children being pressured into hormone therapy, to simply asserting the biological reality of differences in sex are met with immediate hostilities and extreme abuse.

What could have been his 200th was scheduled for 6 p.m. Tuesday at North Myrtle Beach.


  But in the aftermath of the sports season (games and practices for private and public schools) not resuming until April 1, Gainey and the Red Foxes must wait.


  “I guess I’ll have to stew on it for a bit,” Gainey said with a laugh.


  Gainey was then asked how he will spend his sudden free time.


  “I hadn’t had a spring break in 19 years, since I’ve been a part of this program,” Gainey said. “My yard looks terrible, and my wife (Tina) tells me if I spent as much time working on my yard as I do on our baseball field, it wouldn’t look as bad as it does.


  But after two or three days, I’ve got to see my guys,” he added.


  It’s those guys in the Red Fox dugout with whom Gainey thinks he has a special bond.

  It’s those guys in the Red Fox dugout who Gainey believes can win a state championship after runner-up finishes in 2014 and ’15.


  “I just want to win. I love winning. The ultimate prize is winning that last one,” Gainey said. “I just have not gotten to do that yet. We lost to two really good teams (A.C. Flora, Belton-Honea Path). It was nothing we did. They just outplayed us. I’d love to get back and get another shot.


  “I’ve got a good feeling about this team and love the chemistry. The atmosphere in the dugout is just very positive. They’re kind of overlooked by the outside baseball gurus, but that’s fine. I just want us to keep winning.”


  For now, Hartsville’s record will have to remain 5-0.

GUATEMALA CITY/BUENOS AIRES/LIMA -- G uatemala logged its first fatality from coronavirus on Sunday as nations in South and Central America ramped up measures to contain the infection, with Panama banning entry of non-resident foreigners and Honduras closing its borders to passenger traffic for a week.
 The leaders of Argentina and Peru also announced border closures on Sunday to curb coronavirus. Argentina will close its borders for 15 days to non- residents, President Alberto Fernandez said in a televised press conference.
 Public and private school classes would also be suspended until March 31, Fernandez said. National parks would be closed.
 A day earlier, Argentina published a decree establishing a 30-day ban on entry to non-residents who have traveled to a country highly affected by coronavirus in the last 14 days.
 The country has also temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from the United States, China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Britain and many European countries.
 Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra said later on Sunday that Peru would also close its borders, suspending air and sea transport. He called on citizens to self-quarantine for 15 days to help slow the infection.
 In Guatemala, Health Minister Hugo Monroy told a news conference the dead man was a 85-year-old who had recently returned from Madrid without showing signs of illness.
 Doctors confirmed he had the virus early on Sunday, Monroy added. He later died in a private hospital.
 Panama, which has been the hardest hit in Central America, reported its first coronavirus death earlier this week. Panama's health minister Rosario Turner said the number of confirmed cases in the nation rose to 55 from 43 on Saturday.
 From 11.59 p.m on Monday night, only Panamanians and foreign residents would be allowed to enter Panama, security minister Juan Pino said alongside Turner at a news conference.
 Panama has ordered communal areas in hotels, discos, bars, and casinos and elsewhere closed, Turner said.
 The government has also ordered shops in the country to be shut except supermarkets, pharmacies and medical centers. In addition, Panama has suspended elective surgical procedures and limited hospital visits by outpatients, Turner said.
 On Sunday, Honduran police moved people off beaches and out of shops and cafes to enforce an order issued by the government on Saturday to prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people.
 President Juan Orlando Hernandez said in a televised address that from one minute before midnight on Sunday, the country's borders would be closed for a week to all traffic, aside from the movement of goods.
 All businesses in Honduras with a few exceptions including supermarkets, pharmacies, medical centers, hotels, gas stations and banks would be closed for the time being, Hernandez added.
 Costa Rica's government has ordered the closure of all bars and discos as the tally of coronavirus infections in the country rose to 35, the health ministry said on Sunday.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Reserve slashed rates back to near zero, restarted bond buying and launched other measures from its crisis-era toolkit, along with other central banks, to put the floor under a rapidly disintegrating global economy assailed by efforts to contain the escalating coronavirus pandemic.


  “The effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to lower the target range,” the Fed said.


  The Fed cut rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would expand its balance sheet by at least $700 billion in coming weeks.


  “The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,” the Fed said.


  In other moves, the Fed encouraged banks to use the trillions of dollars in equity and liquid assets built up as capital buffers since the financial crisis to lend to business and households whose balance sheets and lives have been upended by the virus.


  The Fed and five other major foreign central banks also cut pricing on their swap lines to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. The Fed, the Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank set up swap lines in the financial crisis. The Fed cut interest rates by half a percentage point on March 3 at an emergency meeting, the first rate cut outside of a regularly scheduled policy meeting since the financial crisis in 2008.

Once the gruesome deed is done, Alpha can die and pass on her leadership to Negan. “I want you to become a lion” she tells him. Negan actively tries to dissuade Alpha from her plan by detailing his wife’s losing battle with cancer. “When she was gone, I didn’t feel much anymore...that was my strength,” he admits. But he accuses Alpha of being a pretender, that it is impossible for humans to act like animals with no emotions. “You still love her” he begs. But Alpha is sticking to her “destiny” schtick, even implying that it was Lucille’s destiny to die from cancer and be “set free.” They reach the shack and Alpha opens the door, ready to make Lydia a permanent member of the undead. But Lydia is not kept there. A confused Alpha turns around as Negan quickly slashes her throat. He gently kisses her goodbye as Alpha chokes and gasps her last breath.

President Donald Trump's proclamation on Wednesday largely restricted entry into the United States for non-citizen European residents is leading to a reduction in flights across the Atlantic and airlines potentially losing a large number of passengers affected by the ban.
 The ban not only prevents European travelers to enter the US but also those who pass through the US to points to reach destinations in other parts of North America, the Caribbean, South America, or Oceania.
 Unlike most countries in Europe as well as neighboring Canada, the US doesn't allow for airside transfers between international flights. The regulation requires all travelers to enter the country before connecting to a flight to a third country, even if the traveler has no intention of staying in the US.
 While most Europeans can enter the US under visa-waiver programs, the requirement to enter the country has ruled out American cities as transit points for those who require formal visas for entry.
 Despite the US government's rules, three French airlines use the Californian cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco as stopover points for flights from Paris to Papeete, French Polynesia, a French territory in the South Pacific better known as Tahiti. Almost directly located under the near-8,500 nautical mile route, California is the ideal stopover point for the route that allows aircraft to refuel and restock before continuing the journey over the Pacific.

Canada has been mostly neutral on this plan from the get-go. Besides a brief statement by Minister of Foreign Affairs, François-Philippe Champagne, that did not endorse the plan but did not directly go against the plan. Other G20 countries who at least at the UN, seem to be more critical of Israel have offered their support, such as Australia, the UK, France, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, and the previously mentioned Saudi Arabia.
 It is in the best interest of the Canada-Israel relationship for Canada to endorse this plan to stand on the right side of history, even though this relationship has been disfigured recently with Canada voting against Israel at the UN last year.
 Trump and his administration have offered an opportunity that does not come around often, or even at all for that matter. The plan is of the best interest for everlasting peace in the Middle East, for both the Israelis and the Palestinians. For the Jewish nation, in particular, it is a gift that no other world leader has ever offered and is both generous and reasonable.

The assumption is with the new collective bargaining agreement passing for the NFL, that’s good news with respect to a possible Tom Brady return to Foxborough, Mass.


  The new CBA opens the door for the Patriots to push money into future years. That would be beneficial in Brady’s case. Instead of having all his money draining the cap this year, it can be spread out.


  So in theory, that’s a huge positive. It allows the Patriots to still be in the hunt for the GOAT. They still have a chance to lure Brady back into the fold.


  Once again, on paper, that would seem to be the narrative.


  Now for the big but — all of that supposition gets blown out the window if Bill Belichick continues his hard line stance. The newly gained flexibility with contracts won’t make a difference if Belichick still isn’t willing to bend. Even if the Hoodie is in a better position to give Brady a better deal from what was originally pitched during a recent phone call, it won’t matter if he stays the course.


  According to a WEEI report, Belichick told Brady that given his dead cap hit ($13.5 million), the Patriots could afford to give him only a one-year deal at less than the $23 million he made last season.


  As it was, prior to the CBA passing, the Patriots didn’t have a lot of cap space to work with if the intention was to sign Brady, and also gather the necessary pieces to compete for a Super Bowl.


  They did, however, have some avenues if they really wanted to sign Brady. Now they have even more, even though the salary cap for 2020 ($198.2 million per club) is lower than anticipated.


  According to cap guru Miguel Benzan of the Boston Sports Journal, the cap space for the Patriots with a $200 million ceiling was $25.4 million. Still not a lot.


  But the Pats can now cut that dead money hit in half to $6.75 million, which would be tacked onto whatever the new cap figure would be with Brady re- signing before hitting free agency.


  So does Belichick make another run at Brady with a new set of rules, and the ability to maneuver a little better?


  Even with some prospective teams dropping out of the running — the Titans have reportedly agreed to terms to re-sign Ryan Tannehill to a multi-year deal — Brady probably doesn’t want to make that call back to the Patriots. After being put off by the initial dialogue with Belichick, he’s happy to wait. Or head out to free agency after the 18th, if free agency is still on, get an offer, and see what the Hoodie has in mind after that.


  The Titans were a destination Brady would have strongly considered. They were a real possibility, but they’re apparently sticking with Tannehill, which is another positive toward Brady returning to Foxborough. That doesn’t mean there aren’t other teams out there willing to court the six-time Super Bowl champion. The Chargers, Raiders and Buccaneers should be in the mix, with the 49ers the wild card, although they appear to out of the Brady Sweepstakes, too.


  So the ball’s in Belichick’s court.


  Did he indicate to Brady or imply his initial offer was solely based on not having a new CBA, and if that would change with a new agreement passed. That’s certainly possible. Brady seemed pleased with the new agreement, applauding NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith for his work getting it done.


  Will they speak again? That’s not out of the question prior to free agency opening. The Patriots can exclusively negotiate with Brady until noon Monday, assuming free agency is still on Wednesday.


  The guess here is there will be more discussion between the two GOATS. How do you let the best player in franchise history walk when there’s no viable solution as a replacement?


  Maybe there’s another offer out there from Belichick. Maybe Brady will give the Patriots more latitude, given New England remains the best option for him going forward.


  Or, it will be more of the same, continuing to indicate Belichick is ready to cut bait with the icon. It’s also possible Brady has already moved on from the Patriots after the previous phone call with Belichick.


  We’ll know soon enough which direction it goes.

I wish he knew how much Amaechi has defended him. From the days of Magnus Abe to now, Amaechi has been telling us that he trusts Oshiomhole and that if he has any flaw, being a puppet to another man’s negative agenda is not one of them. When people told him Magnus was working with Oshiomhole, he said they were wrong, when they told him Oshiomhole was working with Governor Nyesom Wike, he told them to relax. The list goes on. In fact I had to do this interview without his knowledge because he would not want me to. That’s how much he tries to stay away now from the politics. Especially in the South South. His influence became a threat to his fellow South South leaders, so he decided to focus on his ministry and mind his business. Look at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Amnesty Programme and even the issue of National Chairman, no interest. Until recently when Oshiomhole tried to replace Giadom. Amaechi has learnt that you can struggle to place people somewhere today and those same people will deny you tomorrow, so why make unnecessary enemies? Just live and let live.

The exorbitant cost of index options, thanks to extraordinarily high volatility, is deterring traders from taking aggressive bets on the Nifty or the Bank Nifty even as derivatives experts are advising retail investors and traders to avoid the F&O; market for now. Volatility, one of the chief determinants of an option’s price, has surged this month following the carnage on DStreet. India Vix, a volatility index based on Nifty option prices, has rocketed 122 per cent to 51.47 so far this month, coinciding with the 11.12 per cent fall in the Nifty to 9,955.20 Friday. For e.g., an at-the -money (ATM) 9,950 straddle (call and put combined) on Nifty options expiring March 19 costs Rs 712 a share, 3.5-4 times above the normal rate . “Given this high level of volatility even the straddle buyer, who is agnostic market direction, might not make much money,” said Chandan Taparia, derivatives analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Let alone making money, for the straddle buyer to break even, the Nifty must expire at 9,238 or 10,662 from the current 9,950 level. That’s 14 per cent movement over four days. “An option buyer or a seller could lose his shirt, given the sharp gaps at which the market has been opening on cues from global indices such as the Dow Jones, which trade after our markets close,” said Rajesh Baheti , director, Crosseas Capital, who adds “it’s best to stay away for the time being.” If the market rises sharply, as it did on Friday, a call option buyer would gain handsomely but a bearish option seller would lose substantially amid exceptionally high volatility. Also, when the market falls steeply a put option buyer would profit hugely at the cost of a bullish seller. “The problem is market movement can’t be predicted accurately, given the surfeit of news, real and fake,” said SK Joshi, ED, Khambatta Securities. “At such times, traders should avoid taking F&O; bets.” Foreign portfolio investors, one of the mainstays of Indian markets, trimmed their heavy short positions on index futures and index puts Friday. This helped the market recover. However, their cumulative net shorts on index futures are still at a substantial 1,18,819 contracts while cumulative index puts are at 1,89,049 contacts.

In another article, which reads even more bizarrely, the comedian Stewart Lee asks “Can it be right to silence Toby Youngs?” Although I’m tempted to think the misspelling is a clear sign of the author’s lack of writing skills, it’s possibly a comedic tool, or a get-out-of-jail-for-free card – he can pretend he wasn’t talking about Toby Young, but some fictional character. “Toby Youngs is a tragic fly, floating on flimsy wings of unearned privilege and family connections, banging repeatedly into the same windowpane of failure, all the while wishing he were the soaring eagle of legend, instead of something that vomits on to its own food and sucks it back up into its mouth.” Bravo. Once again, the _Guardian_ is showing utter contempt for its political opponents. But at least, when speech is free, crassness and ignorance are free to be ridiculed in plain sight.
 It’s telling that the _Guardian_ is just as bad at ad hominem—perhaps worse—than the British gutter press it loves to deride. Just last week, it published an article condemning the tabloids, particularly the Sun, for their “media frenzy” in the months before TV presenter Caroline Flack’s suicide. Putting themselves on a pedestal in this instance is easy when the target of relentless media attention is a young woman. A white, middle aged, “privileged” (I hate that word) man such as Toby Young is fair game, however. I can’t for one minute imagine slurs found in these two articles – and there are more like them – being used against a woman. Especially not a woman on the left. Imagine the uproar if, say, Afua Hirsch, black feminist and author, was ridiculed in the same way by the Telegraph or the _Daily Mail_.

  According to _the _Toronto Star__ , Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Trudeau government has not ruled out increases to the nation’s carbon tax. In fact, Wilkinson increases were possible as the government prepares to set “legally binding” five-year plans to reduce emissions.

Before parting ways, Falvey said pitching coach Wes Johnson touched base with the pitchers on his staff about their throwing programs. A lot of the team’s starting pitchers were at three to four innings in their progressions and Falvey said the hope would be that they could maintain that level through bullpens to keep their arms as fresh as possible, even though they won’t be in game situations.


  Falvey said he anticipates players would work out a few times a week in the interim and his expectation would be that the team checks in with players fairly regularly throughout the next week or so and continue to evaluate from that point.


  Designated hitter Nelson Cruz posted videos of himself working out on social media Sunday with bands, urging people to work out but avoid gyms, eat healthy and wash their hands.


  “We have a way of electronically communicating to make sure those guys are giving that feedback,” Falvey said. “But the further you get out, and as weeks go by and you don’t have true game activity and baseball activity, we certainly feel like we would need another extended ramp-up, so to speak, to get back and ready to play games.”


  When a spring training part two would actually happen is obviously still up in the air as MLB consistently monitors the situation. The longer the break stretches on, the longer the ramp-up period might need to be.


  MLB has officially delayed the start of the season by two weeks to April 9 and has yet to make a subsequent announcement, but the expectation is that it will be much longer than that, leaving players in limbo for the time being.


  “We’ll be attentive to each player, whether they’re here or not,” Falvey said. “We’ll be attentive to what their weekly plan looks like and what resources they need for those plans.”

BARCELONA, SPAIN - New travel restrictions and border closures reverberated Sunday across Europe and beyond as daily life increasingly ground to a halt to try to keep people apart and slow the spread of the coronavirus. Americans returning home faced chaos at airports as overwhelmed border agents tried to screen passengers.


  Public worship was curtailed as Muslim authorities announced that the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City would be closed indefinitely, and the Vatican said next month's Holy Week services would not be open to the public.


  The number of new coronavirus cases surged in hard-hit Italy to nearly 25,000 and it recorded 368 more deaths to bring its overall toll to 1,809. With the country under a nearly week-old lockdown, Pope Francis ventured out of the Vatican to visit two churches in Rome to pray for the sick, a spokesman said.


  In Spain, long lines for food and police patrols marked the first day of a nationwide quarantine. In the Philippines, soldiers and police sealed off the densely populated capital of Manila from most domestic travelers. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced plans to limit movement nationwide, following Italy and Spain in barring people from leaving their homes except for essential errands or work.


  Ireland ordered all pubs and bars to close for two weeks - including on Tuesday, St. Patrick's Day - and urged people not even to hold house parties. Two pub industry groups had warned of the "real difficulty" in keeping people apart in the country's famous watering holes.


  With new infections dwindling in Asia, Europe has become the main front line of the fight against COVID-19. The virus has infected 156,000 people and killed over 5,800, but nearly 74,000 people have already recovered.


  China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Spain have the most infections. For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.


  People should go out "only alone or with the people who live in their apartment," said Austria's Kurz, whose country has 800 infections.


  That was echoed by one of America's top infectious disease experts.


  "I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing," Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told NBC's "Meet the Press.''


  Travelers returning to the U.S. after the Trump administration imposed a wide-ranging ban on people entering from Europe faced hourslong waits for required medical screenings. Videos and photos on social media showed packed arrival halls and winding lines.


  "This is unacceptable, counterproductive and exactly the opposite of what we need to do to prevent #COVID19," Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth tweeted.


  The U.S. has seen 61 deaths and more than 2,900 infections.


  Italy, the worst-hit European country, reported its biggest day-to-day increase in infections - 3,590 more cases in a 24-hour period - for a total of almost 24,747.


  "It's not a wave. It's a tsunami," said Dr. Roberto Rona, who's in charge of intensive care at the Monza hospital.


  Italy's transport ministry banned passengers from taking ferries to the island of Sardinia and halted overnight train trips, which many in the north had used to reach homes and families in the south.


  Even as authorities pleaded for people to stay home, Pope Francis visited St. Mary Major Basilica, near Rome's central train station, to pray for the sick, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.


  The pontiff then walked to another church with a crucifix that in 1522 was carried in a procession during a plague afflicting Rome. In his prayer, Francis has ''invoked the end of the pandemia that has stricken Italy and the world, implored healing for the many sick, recalled the many victims of these days" and asked for consolation for their family and friends.


  The Vatican said it would close all Holy Week ceremonies to the public with the start of Palm Sunday on April 5. It said that until April 12, when Easter Sunday is celebrated this year, all the general audiences on Wednesday and Francis' Sunday noon prayer will be streamed.


  Holy Week services usually draw tens of thousands to Rome but, with Italy at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, tourism has vanished.


  Spain joined Italy on lockdown after the government declared a two-week state of emergency.


  "From now, we enter into a new phase," said Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, whose wife has tested positive. "We won't hesitate in doing what we need must to beat the virus. We are putting health first."


  In Barcelona, people who ventured out formed long lines to buy bread. Police patrolled parks and told people who were not walking their dogs to go home. The Las Ramblas promenade, the heart of the city and a tourist magnet, was eerily empty.


  The state of emergency "is necessary to unify our efforts so we can all go in the same direction," Mayor Ada Colau said.


  For now, the number of cases is still rising steeply. Spain's Health Ministry said the country has recorded 288 deaths, up from 136 on Saturday. The number of infections rose to 7,753 from 5,700.


  The Netherlands ordered all schools, day-care centers, restaurants and bars to close until April 6. The new restrictions cover the country's famed marijuana-selling "coffee shops" and sex clubs.


  Elsewhere, Morocco suspended all international flights, and Turkey set aside quarantine beds for more than 10,000 people returning from Islam's holy sites in Saudi Arabia.


  In China, where the virus was first detected in December, those arriving on overseas flights were routed to an exhibition center for initial checks before being shuttled to their homes or other quarantine locations.


  Even as social life largely halted - the German capital of Berlin closed bars, cinemas and other facilities Saturday evening - some attempts at keeping up public life persisted.


  France, which has 4,500 infections and 91 deaths, went ahead Sunday with nationwide elections to choose mayors and other local leaders despite a crackdown on gatherings. The government ordered unprecedented sanitary measures, with election organizers having to keep a 1-meter (3-foot) gap between people and provide soap or sanitizing gel and disinfectant wipes for voting machines.


  In Germany, which had reported nearly 3,800 cases and eight deaths, the state of Bavaria also held municipal elections, with poll workers wearing protective gloves. Germany is preparing to close its borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Denmark on Monday, and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said people will no longer be allowed to enter or leave Germany without a valid reason.


  Britain, which has not yet restricted everyday activities, said it plans to set out emergency powers this week, including potentially requiring people over 70 to self-isolate for up to four months and banning mass gatherings.


  "We will do the right thing at the right time," Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC. "We will publish the bill this week coming."


  With the virus having reached 25 of Africa's 54 countries, sweeping restrictions were announced. Kenya is banning travelers from countries with infections and closing all schools for three weeks.


  Senegal and Mauritania also are closing schools. Senegal also banned all public gatherings for a month, stopping cruise ships from docking and suspending Muslim and Christian pilgrimages.


  Muslim authorities announced that Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third- holiest site, would be closed indefinitely, with prayers being held on the sprawling esplanade outside.


  Dalia Samhouri, a regional official with the World Health Organization, said both Iran and Egypt, two of the most populous countries in the Mideast, were likely underreporting cases because infected people can still show no visible symptoms. Iran says it has nearly 14,000 virus cases and 724 deaths, while Egypt has reported 110 cases, including two fatalities.

“I think it’s one of those things where we are trying to make a decision…[when everyone is] affected right now because of anxiousness, and concern, and worry,” Dr. Arnel said. “The second part [of this decision] will be when it hits. If it hits, how bad will it hit, if we just have two percent of our student population out and one or two percent of our faculty out, we’ll probably just continue to go forward. We really have to monitor to what extent it causes illness and what extent our students and faculty have to be quarantined, so really it depends on that, so we’ll react once we hit a certain threshold.”

Liberals may be thinking that this expanded government power will be used against media organizations, journalists, and commentators that they don’t like. But if the power exists, it will be used down the road by governments who may go after the very media figures the Liberals currently love.
 And all of us, regardless of ideology, can agree that government corruption must be exposed. And we can agree that all politicians will have a huge incentive to give government protection to people who do what the government wants, while also having an incentive to punish those who report things or say things they don’t want the public to hear.
 That dangerous incentive is why the power of government must be shackled when it comes to exerting control over the media. Without a free media, without a clear line between the state and the press, a country is not really free.

Sophomore Parker Fox, who earned an All-Region selection, concurred with King saying the Wolves were playing their best basketball at the right time


  "We were hot, coming out of the NSIC and getting ready for Southern," Fox said. "It sucks when you have a team as close as we were and as deep and talented, and you know you can make some noise and then you can't. It was a quiet ride home after that."


  Trying to take any solace in a situation like this is difficult. For Dahl, the stop in Saint Joseph did provide him and the rest of the team one significant opportunity.


  "We did get to have practice, which as it turned out, was our final practice together," Dahl said. "Guys were going hard, getting up and down the floor, just going full speed, like we had all year. I'm glad we had (practice). We could have just gone to the hotel and rested, got ready, but we wanted to get out on the court as a team. I'll take that (memory) with me."


  None of these three players in anyway downplayed what has and continues to happen concerning the spread of this virus.


  "Yeah it hurts, but it was the right decision," King said. "This is pretty serious and (coronavirus) seems to be getting bigger. You want to try and stay ahead of it and keep as many people safe from it. It's bigger than basketball"


  Fox agreed, and noticed a change as soon as they team boarded the bus.


  "Our bus driver had bottles of hand sanitizer up front and in back and said 'There's more where that came from,'" Fox said. "I've never been through anything like this. There was the Ebola (virus) scare, but this is pretty serious. We went to Kesslers the day before we left and toilet paper was flying off the shelf. People are freaked. It just doesn't seem like the world I'm used to."


  Now the task of not being around one another has presented itself. With an extended spring break applied to the Northern State campus, and the very real possibility of the rest of the semester being completed online, the suddenness of the season coming to an end, along with his college career about to close, means time is running out for Dahl and his teammates.


  "That's the one really special thing about this group," Dahl said. "Yeah, we hang out when we're in the gym or working out, but outside the locker room we're just as tight. We like to stick together. Lot of team don't have that. It's a rock solid group that's been that way for four years since I've been here. We have fun, we play hard and we've always done that. That's going to be what I miss the most."

The final story revolves around Bernard Lowe who’s been working at a meat- packing plant laying low and constantly testing himself. He’s devised some kind of device that can turn him on and off. He can interview himself and ask if he’s done anything without his own knowledge. Given how often he was used in the past two seasons, how often his own memories were tampered with, this is a sensible precaution.

Former chairman of Nagari Municipality and YSRCP leader K.J. Kumar, along with his followers, on Sunday created a flutter by barging into the chamber of the election officer (for Nagari Municipality) at Nagari and finding fault with him for accepting the B-forms from candidates seeking to contest for the post of councillor.


  As per information, Mr. Kumar and his followers barged into the election officer’s chamber in the morning, much before the State Election Commission announced the postponement of elections to the local bodies.


  Mr. Kumar was said to have questioned the officer as to how he accepted the B-form from another YSRCP candidate when he had already submitted his nomination papers from the ward concerned.


  A video footage of the incident that went viral on social media platforms allegedly showed Mr. Kumar and his followers moving menacingly towards the officer and using abusive language against him.


  “As per the guidelines, the issue will be viewed seriously. Based on the complaint from the election officer, a case will be booked against the accused,” said Nagari CI. Party cadres observed that it was becoming difficult for Mr. Kumar to have his say after R.K. Roja won the Nagari Assembly seat in the 2019 elections.

London, March 15 (Jiji Press)--Greece's Hellenic Olympic Committee said Sunday that a ceremony slated for Thursday to hand over the Olympic flame to the Tokyo Olympic Games organizing committee will be held behind closed doors due to concerns over the new coronavirus.
 The ceremony in Athens, though with no public in attendance, was planned to be open to the media, but restrictions will be imposed on journalists other than those from the official television station, according to the HOC.
 From Japan, Saori Yoshida and Tadahiro Nomura, who won gold medals in three straight Olympic Games in the women's wrestling and the men's judo, respectively, are scheduled to attend the handover ceremony at Panathenaic Stadium.
 The Olympic flame was lit at a ceremony without a live audience in Olympia, the birthplace of the ancient Olympics, on Thursday, kicking off the Greek leg of the torch relay.
 As spectators crowded the relay route in southern Greece, however, the HOC called off the remainder of the relay in the country following consultations with the Greek Health Ministry and the International Olympic Committee.
