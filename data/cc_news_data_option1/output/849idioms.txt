In terms of value, SEAP and China will continue to spearhead the global air brake reservoirs market, followed by Western Europe. Further, in the coming years, a study suggests that Europeis expected to remain at the top in the growth stakes, just edging ahead of Middle East & Africa. In terms of growth, Russian and Rest of Eastern Europe are set to plunge due to well-developed and mature nature of the rail market. The Indian and other developing countries’ railway network has been growing significantly. Investments and developments in India’s railway sector proliferate new opportunities for the rail component manufacturers. In China, the railway maintenance market is to see substantial growth in the next years. In a nutshell, public policies are bolstering the air brake reservoirs market. North America has a robust manufacturing infrastructure for heavy commercial vehicles. In the coming few years, the growth of the air brake reservoirs market will be mainly driven due to an increase in the production of commercial vehicles, such as trailers.

It could be a challenging transfer window for Mikel Arteta.
 Mikel Arteta has delivered some Arsenal FC transfer news that none of us wanted to hear, but that will hardly come as a big surprise.
 Following our Europa League exit on Thursday night, we now face an uphill struggle to find any other way into the Champions League, with winning the Europa having looked a little more realistic on paper than a late run that could propel us into fourth in the Premier League table.
 It’s clear that another season out of Europe’s top club competition is going to hit us financially, and Arteta has admitted it could mean he has some tough decisions to make when it comes to rebuilding his squad this summer.
 As quoted in a report from Goal, the Spanish tactician doesn’t explicitly say this means he’ll have to sell before he can buy, but it sounds like that’s what he’s alluding to with his comments as he admits our budget will be restricted.
 “The damage caused by the club not being in the Champions League for the third season is really big,” he said.

The belief in the retirement label probably results from the fact that there so exist some retirement-specific savings routes like EPF and NPS which have some characteristics that are specifically designed for retirement savings. By and large, the tax laws offer a simple trade-off for the products that are labelled as tax saving: lock in your money till after you retire and you will have to pay less tax. Some of the tax saving comes from having to pay less tax now, when you save, and some comes from having to pay less (or no) tax after you retire and start using the money. Either way, lower tax serves as the major incentive for retirement savings, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that way.

Elise Cone is involved in athletics, the arts, volunteering, and still maintains a 4.0 grade point average.
   
 It is no surprise that Bartlesville High School officials describe her as a well-rounded student.
   
 For her involvement in and out of the classroom, Cone has been selected as the Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise, Patriot Auto Group, and Truity Credit Union February Student of the Month.
   
 Each month, 12 participating schools in northeastern Oklahoma submit seniors who have an excellent grade point average, display community leadership qualities, active volunteerism and high moral integrity. A panel of judges reviews the submissions and selects two students of the month.
   
 "I'm very blessed and honored. I'm just thankful that my hard work has been noticed. There are so many great students who are involved and intelligent, and I'm just very grateful and thankful," said Cone, a BHS senior.
   
 She has plans to attend a small Christian college to play basketball and major in physical therapy.
   
 "I've narrowed it down to John Brown University, Tabor College or Harding. All of them are small and Christ-centered universities and have strong academics and a good culture," she said.
   
 She became interested in physical therapy following a basketball injury.
   
 "I was interested in sports medicine and then I tore my ACL, so I had to go through physical therapy for six months, and that really gave me an insight into physical therapy and I really love it," she said.
   
 She is now an intern with Peak Physical Therapy and also stays active on the track and golf teams. She is involved with the arts through orchestra, theater and musicals and is always willing to offer support to teammates and peers, according to Leslie Sexson, college and career counselor at Bartlesville High School.
   
 "Elise leads by example. She is the first one to carry a box, sweep a floor, ask to help someone. She practices servant leadership, and prefers that to standing in front and directing others. As a team captain, she stays until the last person has left, makes sure things are cleaned up, and makes sure people have rides home," Sexson said.
   
 She added that Cone shows compassion to those who are less noticed.
   
 "At last year's basketball camp, Elise made a point of focusing on one shy girl who was not extremely skilled. She cried every day when her parents left her," Sexson said. "Elise paid attention to her and helped her feel valued and successful. … Elise receives her greatest rewards by working hard and committing to the good of others."
   
 Volunteerism is second nature to Cone, too. She is involved in Run the Ville, Dodgeball Lighthouse, Salvation Army, YMCA, Home of Hope, Heart of a Child, Jane Phillips Elementary, Grace Community Church, SPCA, Agape, Concern, Bruin Basketball camps, mission trips to underserved areas in other cities, Backpacks for Bruins and more.
   
 "Elise is dedicated to her studies, activities, and friends without drama or personal gain. Elise is humble. She prefers to work behind the scenes and help without recognition," Sexson said.

 The event will begin at 7:45 a.m. with a silent mini-auction, with a complimentary breakfast at 8 a.m.
   
 Guest speakers include Lori Fullbright, KOTV News on 6 award-winning news anchor, and Jessica Woods, a 2013 Rogers State University alumna and past scholarship recipient.
   
 Woods began her college career at Barnsdall High School as a high school student, completing concurrent high school courses for college credit. She said she chose RSU because it was close to home and family, and offered the degree she was seeking in the criminal justice field.
   
 Woods graduated RSU in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science in Justice Administration, working full-time at ConocoPhillips while completing her degree. Over the past seven years, she has held several positions at ConocoPhillips and currently works with Information Technology.
   
 "Scholarships kept me from taking out loans for part of my college career. I graduated without any debt, and I am grateful for scholarships and those who support them," Woods said. "Their financial support helped relieve the financial stress associated with going to college."
   
 Proceeds from the annual fundraising event will provide scholarships for local degree-seeking RSU Bartlesville students. All funds raised stay local.
   
 The 2020 event sponsors include the Arvest Foundation, Arvest Asset Wealth Management, AEP/PSO, Bartlesville Chamber of Commerce, Bartlesville Rotary Club, Vicki and Bill Beierschmitt, John H. Bond, Corky and Charlie Bowerman, Cherokee Nation Businesses, ConocoPhillips, Diversified Systems Resources, Senator Julie Daniels, Vanessa and Ford Drummond, Karen and Martin Garber, Debbie and Mark Haskell, Keleher Outdoor Advertising, John Mihm, Jeri and Mike Moore, John Mansfield (of Wymer, Brownlee, Mansfield), Phillips 66, Stride Bank, Tate Boys and Tires, Angie and Scott Thompson, Tri-County Technology Center, and Truity Credit Union.

ERBITUX(®) is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of ERBITUX(®) is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Based on in vitro evidence, ERBITUX(®) also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR-expressing tumor cells (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [ADCC]).

Christina White was elated when she found out she would return to shortstop for her senior season with Maryville College’s softball team.
 The Alcoa High School graduate intended to play middle infield when she signed with Maryville, but once White got on the team it was clear she was needed in the outfield. It went well for three seasons, but for her, there is nothing quite like backhanding grounders in the hole or running toward second base and throwing to first base across her body. This year she finally is getting an opportunity to do that, and she has been thrown into a fire hotter than she ever could have imagined.
 It is virtually impossible to throw out any of her teammates.
 “I’ll get grounders and they will beat me out nine times out of 10 and coach (Leah) Kelley just shrugs because she knows every other offense is not going to be that way. They beat me by one step then I am going to beat (a player on) another team by six steps.
 “I would say (my success rate throwing out teammates) is pretty decent, but honestly they show me up a lot. It humbles me.”
 The Scots’ opponents are feeling White’s pain so far this season. They can’t keep them from scoring runs. Maryville swept visiting Methodist Sunday afternoon 8-5 and 13-5 and now has scored at least 10 runs in five of six games this season. The Scots (5-1) did that seven times in 40 games all of last season.
 They averaged 5.6 runs per game last season. So far this year they’re scoring 11.7 per game. Last year Maryville was more likely to drive in a run with an extra-base hit. This year the Scots are better suited for putting the ball in play and beating out ground balls. The lineup is full of those type of players.
 It starts with White at the leadoff spot and continues with freshman Courtney Deck, a Heritage High School graduate who was named the USA South Athletic Conference’s Rookie of the Week last week for a productive weekend that included a 5-for-5 performance and is still hitting .550 after Sunday’s doubleheader. The bottom of the lineup is comprised of speedsters Kennedy Richardson, Amaya Goodloe and Ashton Hayden. None of them have to hit it out of the infield to reach base. Usually they just have to hit it to the left side.
 “One of the biggest things is speed doesn’t slump,” coach Leah Kelley said. “They’re going to consistently put the ball in play and consistently put the pressure on the defense. It’s really working to our favor right now.
 “Our hitters are doing an outstanding job of being consistent in the box. Their pitch selection is really good as well — hitting pitches they know they can put good contact to.”
 There is plenty of power in the middle of the lineup with freshman Jazmine Geary, another Heritage graduate, Taylor Campbell, Reid Ballard and Morgan Brewer. Campbell already has three home runs, including a two-run shot to the opposite field in Sunday’s second game, after leading the team with nine last season. Kelley said she expected the offense to be potent even before the season began, noting that the Division III opponents they’ll face more often than not will struggle to throw out Maryville’s players that have Division I-caliber speed.
 A great offense is the best friend of a team’s pitchers, and that is especially the case for Maryville this year. The Scots lost reigning USA South Pitcher of the Year Kaitlyn Smith when she enrolled in the school’s nursing program after last season, and they are using four freshmen this season.
 Hannah Bruce and Danielle Abell lead the way with a combined record of 5-0, but Abell’s team-leading ERA of 3.42 is hardly scintillating. The pitching situation is not a surprise for Maryville, and Kelley praised pitching coach Kadey Robinson’s work with them in the early going.
 “With freshman pitchers they are always going to be teachable moments,” Kelley said. “They’re doing a really good job of executing. Every now and then they’re going to give up hits. I told our offense and our defense as long as we score more runs than we give up we will win every single game. That’s our ultimate goal.
 “We know some runs may be scored, but as long as we score more then we win the game.”
 Winners of the last two conference titles, Maryville has its eyes set on a third in a row and another try at the NCAA Tournament. Kelley has been vocal about raising Maryville to a high level, and if it keeps piling up the runs like it has so far this season, that could happen as early as this season.
 “I’m really proud of everybody,” White said. “We lost a few seniors, but we’ve come back like we’re the same team.”

Adam Nagy was still a little wasteful in possession but I have to say he was always looking to do the right thing and did try and keep the side moving forward.
 Jamie Paterson, Callum O’Dowda, Andi Weimann and Famara Dièdhiou all worked hard but couldn’t find the moments of quality to open up Millwall. Our attacking threat and creativity is still a concern at the moment.

Unsurprisingly, Johnson made a number of changes to his starting line-up.
 I read after the game that he has made 87 alterations to his starting line-up this season, with only Charlton Athletic boss Lee Bowyer making more. Injuries and illness come into that but it does also beg the question as to whether the head coach knows his best XI or formation.
 To be fair, I don’t. The biggest concern for me is how players come in, play some of a game and then are out of the squad altogether.
 How a creative player like Kasey Palmer wasn’t able to get on to the pitch at Huddersfield on Tuesday is beyond me and Kasey found himself out of the squad altogether on Saturday.

Don’t despair – top four is very much up for grabs.
 Most Arsenal fans will likely still be feeling gloomy after our shocking Europa League exit, but results in the Premier League this weekend should lift all our spirits.
 Firstly, Liverpool finally lost a game of football! Ignore what some of the haters are saying, this shows just how remarkable our Invincibles achievement was – many great teams have had a stab at it and always come up short. I’ve seen some mocking us on Twitter for celebrating the fact that we drew at home to the likes of Birmingham, Portsmouth and Fulham that season, despite the fact that Liverpool just got battered 3-0 by relegation-threatened Watford. Way to miss the point!
 Anyway, while it’s a nice little boost to be able to celebrate the immortality of that legendary 2003/04 side for another year, it doesn’t do much for our current side’s immediate future.
 Still, we have Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham to thank for that as they all stepped up to drop points in their league games this weekend.
 First, Chelsea continued their recent slump as they only managed a 2-2 draw away to Bournemouth. Having taken the lead, they later found themselves 2-1 down and had to claw back a late equaliser. The Blues were far from convincing, and it’s a minor miracle they still occupy that fourth spot: Frank Lampard’s side have won just one of their last six in the Premier League, and in truth it’s hard to see them staying there. We just need to make sure we can be the ones to take advantage.

As he explains: “Seeing is believing. We can simulate solar activity and make predictions using data and computers, but this is the first time we have been able to see high resolution images of the activity taking place on the surface of the Sun. For the team here at Northumbria the real excitement will come in a few months’ time. Once we have a series of images taken over several weeks and months, we can use the software we have developed to track the changes taking place on the Sun’s surface. This will really allow us to look at the Sun in ways we simply haven’t been able to before now.”
