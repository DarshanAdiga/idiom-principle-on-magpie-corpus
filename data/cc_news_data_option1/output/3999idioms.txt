Roosevelt played football as a youth and later tried to make the Harvard squad, but his nearsightedness kept him off the varsity. He believed that strenuous activities were good. After all, he was a Rough Rider for the First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry.
 As New York City police commissioner, Teddy helped revive the annual Harvard- Yale football series. It was canceled for two years following the 1894 game known as “the bloodbath at Hampden Park.”
 Roosevelt used the bully pulpit — and his “big stick” philosophy — to bring change to the game. In October 1905, he invited the head coaches of Harvard, Yale and Princeton — the nation’s premier collegiate powers — to the White House and urged them to reel in the excessive violence and set a precedent for the rest of the nation.
 The game only seemed to get more violent. The Chicago Tribune referred to the 1905 season as a “death harvest.” It reported that there were 19 player deaths and 137 serious injuries around the nation.
 Teddy, a frequent visitor to Colorado Springs before during and after his presidency, went as step further and invited other college leaders to the White House after the 1905 season and demanded more radical rule changes. The forward pass was legalized. Mass formations were abolished. First-down distance was increased to 10 yards, with three downs to gain the necessary yardage.
 Fatalities declined to 11 per year in both 1906 and 1907, and injuries also fell dramatically. More rule changes to make the game safer were adopted over the next several years, and in 1920 the NFL was formed as the American Professional Football Association (APFA). It renamed itself the National Football League for the 1922 season.
 As for Teddy and his connection to the Pikes Peak region: My friend, Don Moon, is one of the best Teddy Roosevelt impersonators in the nation. Don tells me that Teddy journeyed to Colorado Springs “some 20 times” to visit his friend Philip Stewart. Teddy also became friends with Edwin Nichols, owner of The Cliff House in Manitou Springs, and stayed there on numerous occasions.

Is anything in life free from potential fraud?
 "No" was Steven Kerrigan's answer.
 Kerrigan is Marlborough's city clerk, a job he's held since May, after serving seven years as assistant clerk.
 When it comes to mail-in ballots in Massachusetts, Kerrigan said, "I feel relatively certain the system is secure."
 That statement diverges from President Donald Trump, who continues to claim mail-in ballots are ripe for fraud, and could render next month's presidential election vote tally an exercise in illegitimatacy.
 To get a clear understanding of how the mail-in ballot system works in Massachusetts, the Daily News also spoke with Amy Neves -- Milford's town clerk since 2007 -- and Christopher Latimer, chairman of the political science department at Framingham State University.
 Neves said she and her staff are doing their best to ensure the mail-in ballot process is safe by following the rules set by Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin's office.
 Latimer made his point directly: "Mail-in ballots are not ripe for fraud."

 The Massachusetts mail-in ballot process begins with a postcard sent by Galvin's office to every registered voter, asking if they want a mail-in ballot. Some other states automatically send ballots to all registered voters.
 Kerrigan said that's an important distinction, because the process of requesting ballots establishes a tightly-managed paper trail to prevent fraud.
 Massachusetts voters who want a mail-in ballot sign the postcard and mail it back to the municipal clerk's office in their community. They can also drop it off in person, or place it in a locked drop box. Most communities have drop boxes at town/city hall. Others can be found at post offices and other public spots.
 Marlborough received more than 8,000 postcard requests, as of Tuesday. Milford received 6,000 postcards.
 Staff in clerk's offices throughout Massachusetts enter each voter's postcard information into the state's voter registration system. That allows voters to track the status of their mail-in ballot through the state's "Track My Ballot" online portal.
 Marlborough and Milford await the arrival of ballots from Galvin's office. The deadline for Galvin to get those ballots to clerks statewide is next Friday. When ballots do arrive, staff will mark each one as received and mail them to the voters who requested them.
 When voters receive a ballot in the mail, they mark it, sign it, and return it to the clerk's office, where they are marked as received and entered in the state's voter registration system. They are then locked in a municipal vault until Election Day (Nov. 3).
 Marlborough has a central tabulation facility where poll workers on Election Day process the ballots.
 In Milford, police deliver the ballots to polling locations where staff feed them into a tabulation machine. After polls close at 8 p.m., Milford police return them to Town Hall, where they are put in the locked vault.
 Mail-in ballots received up to 5 p.m. on Nov. 6 -- three days after Election Day -- will be counted, as long as they're postmarked by Nov. 3, according to state law. All ballots must be counted by Nov. 18 in order to be certified by Galvin's office.
 State law says all ballots must be held in a secured storage area for 22 months after Election Day, and then they can be destroyed. Marlborough and Milford historically try to hold onto ballots longer than 22 months, until they reach the point of running out of storage space.
 Latimer, of Framingham State, mentioned verification of voter signatures can sometimes be a challenge, especially for absentee ballots arriving from overseas. A voter's handwriting changes over a lifetime, so comparing a signature on file with a present one isn't always easy.
 Claims that mail-in ballots can be tampered with after they're put in public drop boxes are unfounded, Latimer said. He said the only way that could be done is removing a box from its bolted-down position -- an unlikely scenario.
    6% of voters in Milford mailed-in ballots in 2016. 87% did in June. What does that mean for November 2020?  
 The coronavirus pandemic contributed to a spike in mail-in ballot requests, because some voters don't want to go to the polls and run the risk of infection. Latimer has a health condition, and hasn't decided whether to vote in person or by mail-in ballot. He'll wait to see what the COVID infection rate is in his community in the days leading up to Nov. 3 before he makes a decision.
 Meanwhile, Latimer said he's concerned about the amount of time it's going to take election workers to count the expected avalanche of mail-in ballots. Each one must be verified by a Republican, Democrat and nonpartisan representative, according to Latimer, a painstaking process that is magnified by this presidential election.
 "It's going to take time," Latimer said.
 As for the risk of increased fraud connected to mail-in ballots, Latimer said it's "almost non-existent."
 "You can never be 100% sure, but I'm pretty sure, close to 100% sure, that there will be no fraud," he said.
 "Can I say mail-in voting is devoid of fraud? No, I can't make that claim," added Kerrigan. "The clerks and the Secretary of the Commonwealth have worked as hard as they can to make this mail-in voting as fraud-free as they can make it."

“We’ve made the difficult decision not to do a fourth season of ‘Glow’ due to COVID, which makes shooting this physically intimate show with its large ensemble cast especially challenging,” a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement. “We are so grateful to creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, Jenji Kohan and all the writers, cast and crew for sharing this story about the incredible women of ‘GLOW’ with us and the world.”
 The show had been renewed for its last season last year. Production had begun on Season 4 earlier this year but was shut down early on due to the pandemic. With no sign of when the series, which involves most of the lead actresses being in close proximity to each other in the ring, would be able to safely resume production, Netflix decided to pull the plug. According to an individual with knowledge of the situation, all of the series regulars have been paid in full for Season 4.
