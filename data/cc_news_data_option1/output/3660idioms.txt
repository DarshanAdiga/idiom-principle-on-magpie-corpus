“It just hasn't really hit me yet,” the 28-year-old said. “It's kind of crazy, I didn't even know how to celebrate. Just something that all came together today. Obviously a memory I'll have forever."
 Mills (5-3) threw 114 pitches and hardly had any close calls in Chicago's 16th no-hitter. Avisail Garcia almost got to him twice, hitting a line drive to right in the first and nearly legging out an infield hit to shortstop in the sixth. Garcia crossed first and immediately called to the Brewers dugout for a review, but after a very brief stoppage, the Brewers opted not to challenge.

It rained the entire time. But there sure were a lot of smiles. So many smiles.
 Many smiles came through a handful of miles down the road over at MacPhail Field in Scottville. There, it was a double-whammy of youth football practice and equipment pick-up and the second annual Kira Bell Softball Tournament.
 While the kids were getting a bit slick on the grass, the softball tournament doubled as a human mud bog. Were the players frowning as their shoes and cleats sank deeper and deeper in the infield? Nope. Smiles, smiles and smiles.
 And the smiles were there for the Herliens, too. They helped to run the concession stand as well as a couple of raffles. They shared a lot of laughs and smiles. Kira, the daughter of Matt and Katie Herlien, passed away last winter from complications because of cystic fibrosis. The couple’s daughter, Keelie, also suffers from the disease.
 But it was a good time with lots of laughs. It also came with a bit of tears of joy.
 There may have been those tears, but man, there were a whole lot of smiles in the mud and muck.
 Saturday seemed like it was a pretty rotten day if you kept looking outside your window and saw nothing but dark skies and rain.
 If you got out and about, though, there was so much beaming in our communities. It didn’t take much to find it, either.

"Brad is an extremely likeable guy on and off the ice, he's very easy going and doesn't let anything get on top of him. He moved past mistakes with ease and was probably the calmest goalie I've worked with. You don't win without good goaltending, this re-signing will give us all a lot of confidence and add belief to   the team in front of him. I’m delighted he will be back for a second season.”
