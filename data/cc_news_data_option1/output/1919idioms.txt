“Wherever you are, I think it’s your feelings and thoughts, the wish to pray, that’s what’s important,” Zama said. “Whether online or offline, I don’t think it matters.”


  For Ono, praying in the sacred shrine is still better. He said he hoped people will visit the shrine for a real experience when it reopens. The shrine ended the online prayers last Sunday to prepare for its upcoming annual festival.


  Shinto is Japan’s indigenous religion that dates back centuries and it literary means “the way of kami,” which refers to Shinto gods or spirits. It’s a form of animism that believes in sacred spirits residing in living things and nature, including wind, rain, mountains, trees, rivers and fertility.


  Purification is key to Shinto rituals to keep away evil spirits. Worshipers can also make a wish for traffic safety, good health, success in business or exams, safe childbirth and many other things.


  There are about 80,000 shrines in Japan. Revered as the most sacred is Ise Shrine in central Japan that venerates the sun goddess Amaterasu, the mythological ancestor of the emperor.


  Not everyone in the conservative religion agrees with the departure from the traditional in-person prayers.


  Naomi Shiba tweeted six prayers at the online shrine, in the hopes of an early end to the pandemic, for her two sons to be able to resume their work and studies, and for herself to lose some weight.


  “Perhaps this is the way to do it in the current age,” she said.

It should be axiomatic that scientific integrity is crucial to public health decisions. Government scientists _must_ be able to carry out and share their research without fear of reprisal. Advisory committees that provide recommendations to federal agencies should be staffed with experts and their work should be transparent.


  The country’s level of preparedness should also be transparent, so that public health systems, state and local governments and businesses large and small can better address another health crisis. The strategic national stockpile should be audited regularly, with reports of quantities and quality of life-saving medical supplies reported to Congress and governors. The methods and formulas used to distribute supplies from the stockpile should also be transparent to ensure all states can access supplies fairly and to ensure that political decisions do _not_ influence which states will be eligible to receive federal support.


  Transparency, coordinationCorporate interests should not undermine public health decisions, especially during a pandemic. Shortages of medicines or vaccines should not be deemed confidential commercial information and companies receiving taxpayer funds for a pandemic response should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Whistleblowers who report on the misuse of funds should be protected from retaliation. Data transparency should be a condition of federal funding for clinical research.


  As was the case after 9/11, siloed information and the failure of agencies to communicate with one another has put the public at risk. The dissolution of the National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense left a void where there should be a clear structure and strategy for coordinated pandemic preparedness and response. A robust mechanism is needed to ensure decision-makers across federal agencies and states are on the same page.


  In the midst of this crisis, much remains unknown. Will we get sick? Are our jobs secure? What will our communities look like when it is safe to return to some semblance of normal life? But where there is information that should be known — facts related to the science of the virus, our preparedness and the impact of the outbreak — it is incumbent upon our leaders to inform the public.

And while it has been deemed un-American to criticize public education (won’t somebody think of the children?) it’s worth asking why they still do things as they did in 1950. The costs of failing to adapt to modern efficiencies have become too great to ignore. Why are we still worried about classroom size? Why do we even need classrooms?


  The virus has the power to destroy not just health, but brick-and-mortar education. As colleges are forced to teach online, motivated young people are bound to find out that a good and free education is already to be had on the University of YouTube. Once employers come to grips with the fact that these kids are just as qualified — and have no debt, thus lower salary demands — as someone with a fancy sheepskin, the tweed-jacket world of higher ed could crumble.


  Even health care itself is being shaken to the core as coronavirus is breaking the habit of knee-jerk doctor and emergency room visits. You can spend $3,000 at the ER or $20 for a telehealth consultation. What are you going to do? And what are hospitals going to do when this cash cow dries up?


  What happens to us long-term is largely beyond our control. The virus will have the last word. If Trump is right and it all disappears by midsummer, it will be back to business as usual. If the scientists are right and we get hit by wave after wave of COVID, we will be forced to rethink everything. Because, saddled with trillions in debt, we will be forced to.


  All the institutions, public and private, that have feathered their nests with easy cash and stacked the deck to prevent assault on their temples, will be brought to bear, their emperors made to account for their lack of clothes.


  It has been America’s great fortune to stumble ahead over the past 50 years without even trying. But this economic and social autopilot has allowed us to get soft, and for charlatans to infect our systems just as surely as the virus. It’s been awhile since we’ve rolled up our sleeves and gotten serious. We’ve always had the capability; coronavirus may finally give us the will.

Justice said he won’t hesitate to order businesses to close their doors again if the state starts to see new outbreaks of COVID-19 cases.


  “If the numbers start to move a little bit against us, don’t get upset with me if we have to shut back down,” he said. “At the drop of a hat, we’ll shut it back down in order to be able to protect our people.”


  Dr. Clay Marsh, the state’s COVID-19 czar, has said he believes the state will be able to reopen businesses in a safe manner.


  “As we open up, we’re going to have more risk of people getting infection with the COVID virus,” he said. “We know that we have certain parts of our state that have more connection to other parts of the country — particularly the Eastern Panhandle, the Northern Panhandle, Mon County — where we may see more cases because of those border counties.


  “But if West Virginians do what you’ve done so far and continue to protect yourself, protect your neighbors, protect your community, continue to keep the curve flat and protect the health-care workers as we have done and are doing now, then we can continue to open, to flourish and be beacons for the rest of the country.”


  The state also has released a new COVID-19 alert plan that will allow public health officials to identify areas of the state with increasing rates of COVID-19 and implement measures tailored to individual counties to mitigate further transmission of the disease, according to State Health Officer and Bureau for Public Health Commissioner Dr. Cathy Slemp.


  The new plan will be data-driven and will help identify areas experiencing increases in cases of COVID-19, Slemp said.


  “The system we’re putting in place identifies when disease activity is increasing in ways that warrant more aggressive asserted public health action. It’s based on thresholds,” she said.


  The state will now use a rolling seven-day sum of new cases, excluding “outbreak or facility outbreak cases,” Slemp said.


  When the “threshold,” which varies depending on a county’s population, is met, it will trigger a rapid assessment looking at “additional data, understanding what’s actually happening in the community and getting a more detailed understanding of that,” Slemp said.


  Once the assessment is complete, the governor may then assign that county a “high alert status” if data suggest an increase in community transmission, Slemp said.


  “Essentially, it’s an opportunity to trigger action by many. Depending on the local needs and issues uncovered, the actions to be taken would include such things as strongly reinforcing or potentially increasing community mitigation measures. It could include providing additional resources and supports — additional contact investigation and tracing support, expanded lab testing, education and enforcement supports — to really reinforce or strengthen community mitigation measures,” she said.


  Once on the heightened alert list, a county will stay on it until there is “a consistent decrease in community spread of COVID-19” based on data and in collaboration with the local health department, according to a news release from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services.

The News & Advance was unable to identify or contact any relatives of the victims.
 According to a plea agreement dated March 1991, Burnette pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, one for each of the two victims, as well as one felony count of arson for setting on fire the home of the two victims. A second charge of arson was dropped as part of the plea.
 According to testimony, Virgil S. Fox Jr., Virgil Fox III’s father, hired his son and Burnette to beat the women and burn down their home in exchange for $5,000. The younger Fox testified he clubbed his aunt repeatedly in the head with a piece of taped metal pipe while Burnette watched, according to Nelson County Times archives.
 Burnette, who had started a small fire in the basement of the home only days prior to the fatal blaze, assisted in the death of Carolyn Fox.
 Upon responding to the blaze, firefighters found charred remains of the two women in March 1990. A medical examiner testified in the case that Carolyn Fox sustained three skull fractures while Lillian Fox suffered one skull fracture, according to archives.
 The medical examiner also testified to evidence of soot and burns in the breathing passages of the two women, indicating they were alive when the fire started.
 Tommy Harvey, Nelson County Board of Supervisors chairman, was with the Rockfish Valley Fire Department when the fatal blaze and earlier fire occurred.
 Now chief of the department, he did not comment on Burnette’s release, but he did recall responding to both fires.
 “I remember that very well,” he said. “It was a very gruesome scene. You get that smell of a burnt body, and it takes forever to get rid of it. It sticks with you for quite a bit of time.”
 After a nine-day trial in 1992, a Nelson County jury opted to give Virgil S. Fox Jr. life in prison rather than the death penalty.
 Burnette was convicted before Virginia’s General Assembly abolished discretionary parole in 1995. According to the Virginia Department of Corrections website, inmates convicted prior to 1995 are eligible for parole if they meet certain conditions.
 The Virginia Parole Board, the website says, is the body responsible for handling all parole policies, decisions and rulings.
 Burnette’s attorney at the time, according to court records, was Michael T. Garrett, who since July 2015 has presided as a circuit judge in Amherst County and until last year regularly sat over cases in Nelson Circuit Court.
 His office declined to comment, saying he would not speak on a past case.
 “This was a dastardly deed, one which cannot be explained as an emotional crime or a random crime,” former Nelson Circuit Judge David Berry said at the elder Fox’s April 23, 1992, sentencing hearing, according to archives. “It’s a dumb crime. Just plain stupid and probably induced by drunkenness.”
 Court evidence revealed the elder Fox lapsed into a two-month drinking binge before the murders.
 Former Nelson Commonwealth’s Attorney Joseph Serkes, who later served two decades as a Nelson General District Court judge, prosecuted the case. The retired judge was quoted in the May 7, 1992, edition of the Nelson County Times as saying he was satisfied with the outcome and thought Burnett was the least culpable.
 “I feel that justice was served,” Serkes said shortly after Burnette’s sentencing.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Saturday said he needs “more guarantees” before the green light can finally be given for the resumption of Serie A after a two-month lockdown due to the coronavirus.


  Clubs have already suggested June 13 as a date for the championship to restart while group training will get underway on Monday.


  However, there are splits over how to proceed.


  “Before starting the season, we need a few more guarantees and, speaking to Minister for Sport Vincenzo Spadafora, we don’t have those at this moment,” Conte told a televised news conference.


  “I hope they can be achieved as soon as possible.”


  Many clubs consider that the health protocol, painstakingly drawn up by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), following recommendations of the government’s Technical and Scientific Committee, is impossible to enforce.


  Two points are proving particularly problematic.


  The first concerns the logistical difficulties for clubs to try and organise a two-week group training period from Monday.


  Players would theoretically have to train together, then eat and sleep at the training centre or a hotel entirely available to the team to avoid any risk of contagion.


  Many clubs do not have these facilities.


  The second concerns the government insistence on quarantine for the entire team and staff, in the event of a positive test.


  Italian clubs favour the German model, where only the infected person is quarantined.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Toni Gibbs-Vanzant remembers walking through sliding glass doors in hospitals to prepare for countless 12-hour shifts as a nurse in the intensive care unit. Vanzant, 65, of Jackson, spent many days and nights for nearly 41 years caring for critically ill patients. “I absolutely loved my job,” Vanzant said. “I helped save lives and I always felt like I was making an impact in society. “It was no better feeling to know that my work made a difference.” Now, Vanzant, along with one of her sisters — Rebecca Gibbs — look to provide the best health care to the most important person in their lives — their 90-year-old mother, Lettie Gibbs, who was diagnosed with dementia. In the midst of the pandemic, it’s what matters most to them. ‘SHE WAS THE NEIGHBORHOOD’S MS. LETTIE' Vanzant and Gibbs are two of their mother’s seven children. When younger and even into their adult lives, their mother’s house was the life of the Washington Addition neighborhood in west Jackson. “She used to make biscuits, bake cakes from scratch like caramel, chocolate and Italian cream, sew clothes and work in her garden,” Gibbs said. “She was the neighborhood ‘Ms. Lettie’. Everybody hung out at our house. We always said we did not have much, but we always had enough food to feed everybody because my mother made sure that we did.” Gibbs, who also lives in Washington Addition, worked as a manager at the Hudspeth Regional Center in Whitfield from 2004 to early 2018 before joining her sister to take care of their mom. Gibbs had planned to work a few more years before retiring. “He (God) shattered my plans and I had to step up to the plate to help my momma,” she said. “You never know what life is going to throw at you.

Editor:


  I just have to point out a slight misconception of a letter writer on Sunday (May 3), expressing opinion as to whether Obama could or could not be our president again. Amendment XXII, Section 1, certainly does say, "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice." However, the key word that catches my eye is "elected."


  If, as the original letter writer pointed out, Obama were vice-president, and the need for the presidential line of succession were upon us, the vice- president would, according to the U.S. Constitution, become president. Certainly not so easily written off by Amendment XXII, Section 1. If nothing else, it opens up an interesting debate.


  Also, to the letter writer worried about "fake" mail-in ballots, I implore you to research the mail-in ballot process, or the voting process in general, for that matter. I find it telling this writer seems to believe this type of behavior is seemingly perpetuated by Democrats. One need only to look back to the 2018 elections in North Carolina to read about Republican voter fraud.

The third period was characterised by an unbridled display of British national aggrandisement. As an economic, political, and military power, Britain was in the ascendant in the world. She had completely recovered from the humiliation which she had suffered about a century earlier in America, and had established a new and satisfying economic relationship with the latter. She had, since the loss of America, conquered or acquired new territories like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, all of which remained loyal to the mother country. She had subjugated India and a few other Asian territories. In a predatory alliance with France and America separately, she had compelled China and Japan, by force of arms, to do business - sometimes bad business, but lucrative for the British, as in the case of the opium trade with China - on her terms. The threats which the French revolution and its aftermath constituted had been dispelled. Napoleon Bonaparte had long since been defeated at Waterloo, and the long era of peace under Queen Victoria was in full swing.

Germans with holiday homes in Mallorca are clamouring to return to the sun- soaked island as the coronavirus lockdowns ease, but Spanish authorities are pushing back.


  Several hundred Germans have in recent weeks sent pleading, sometimes angry letters to the regional government of the Balearic Islands asking them to allow foreign property owners to return to their second homes.


  The campaign was started by German national and Mallorca resident Ralf Becker, 55, who believes the travel restrictions aimed at halting the pandemic are "completely over the top".


  "Tourists have to come to Mallorca this year, or else the island will be poorer. Almost everything here depends on tourism," he told the weekly Der Spiegel in late April.


  The protesters have warned that keeping them away from their properties could make them think twice about their investments on the island.


  Mallorca has long been one of the most popular destinations for Germans abroad, so much so that it is sometimes jokingly referred to as Germany's "17th state".


  Some 4.5 million Germans visited Mallorca last year to enjoy its idyllic beaches and bustling nightlife.


  \- 14-day quarantine -


  But the Spanish government is refusing to budge, wary of moving too quickly as it cautiously relaxes lockdown measures in one of Europe's worst-affected countries.


  To limit the risk of a second wave of infections, Madrid has limited air and sea arrivals to Spanish nationals and permanent residents only, as well as people in certain professions.


  All international arrivals also have to self-quarantine for 14 days.


  The quarantine measure is expected to stay in place for the duration of Spain's state of emergency, which Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez aims to extend until late June.


  The new rule deals another blow to the country's battered tourism sector, and to second-home owners itching to get back to their place in the sun.


  The question of when foreigners can start to return "is one we ask ourselves every day", Francina Armengol, the regional president of the Balearic Islands, told reporters on Thursday.


  She said she hoped that some tourists could return "in a controlled way" in July, as well as those who owned holiday dwellings.


  "But unfortunately I can't give any guarantees," she added.


  Lufthansa's budget airline Eurowings this month resumed flights between Dusseldorf and Palma de Mallorca, but with services running "at less than 10 percent" of the usual capacity, it said.


  The passengers so far have been mainly residents, business people and those with urgent reasons for travel, according to Eurowings.


  \- 'Not an amusement park' -


  German lawmaker Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, from the liberal Free Democrats party, shared the frustration felt by German second-home owners as they face an uncertain wait.


  "The many EU citizens who have for years paid property taxes in the Balearic Islands should be treated differently from those who are only popping in as tourists," he said.

  A letter of April 15 was right on the money. If you want to serve this country you should be subject to a few rules. It seems that they have forgotten why they were elected instead trying to impeach a president with rigged proof, completely disregarding legislation for the people who elected them.


  Then they have the nerve to constantly send us letters asking how we feel about abortion, battered women, child molesters, etc., etc., with the implication that they will find a solution if you will reelect them and that requires that you must send them money!


  Now we have a choice $10, $25, $50, $100, $500 or more! Why do we support these dinosaurs — many who have been in Congress over 20 years a few even longer! A recipe for corruption! It's time they are paid for what they accomplish and not for what they promise.

"You know. It's like family. We'll just sit around and talk about what's going on in the world that day."


  The afternoon crowd stays until around 7 p.m., and then the "nighttime" regulars arrive.


  "They'll shoot pool, do things like play jukebox," Gilkey said. "On the weekends, we get different groups of people — younger people."


  The Owl's Club is a social anchor for Gilkey and the regulars. When one regular customer died in 2017, his family mentioned The Owl's Club in his obituary.


  "Every once in a while, you get something new, but not often," she explained. "It's usually the same group — (from) Oak Hill, Fayetteville, mainly."


  Since March 18, the day after the governor's directive, the club has sat quiet and empty, but Gilkey said she has not let go of any of her employees, thanks to the SBA loan.


  Bartender Chris Lambey, 38, applied for unemployment on March 29 but had not received it by Friday.


  He is not alone. Since early March, over 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment, setting a record for the biggest spike of joblessness in the nation's history.


  In response, states have paid a record $48 billion in unemployment benefits to people out of work. According to an analysis by One Fair Wage, a nonprofit that advocates for restaurant workers, 56 percent of those who have applied for unemployment insurance are getting benefits. Meanwhile, 44 percent are still waiting.


  In April, Lambey said he loves his job at The Owl's Club, where he has worked for around four years.


  The hardest part of being out of work for a month has not been the loss of money, said Lambey.


  "I hate it because it's hurting me, not getting around my friends," he said. "Financially, I've set back money, of course.


  "I'm not saying I'm a genius, but I know how to do that stuff, just in case of times like this.


  "But it's terrible. I'm not a homebody," explained Lambey. "I just enjoy hanging out with (patrons).


  "It's my favorite job because I get to hang out with my best friends. They're considered family to me."


  He said he enjoys having a cold beer waiting on a regular or mixing their favorite drink, before they ask. He also considers The Owl's Club job "the best job" he had ever had, and the owners are his friends.


  Lambey said he has spent his days since March 18 at home, "just sitting around," as he waits for word that the bar will re-open.


  "I'm just riding it out, like everybody else is," he said. "I tell you what, it's driving me crazy. I'm ready to go, right now."


  Gilkey said she believes that the pandemic — the first one in The Owl Club's history — will change bar operations.


  "I don't think it's ever going to be the same again," she said. "I do believe that.


  "I think we're going to have to take different regimens. We're going to have to, maybe, not have as many people," she predicted. "I don't think everything will get back to normal.


  "This will be our new normal."


  She expects the changes could last a couple of years.


  "We'll have to be more careful with everything," said Gilkey. "If they do decide to let us open up soon, we can't just go full force back all at once."


  Gilkey said the bar has been cleaned and that the alcohol has been preserved. She and the staff are just waiting to get the go-ahead to open the doors and let in the customers.


  "We will be ready," she said.

CAMDEN — Camden County’s property tax rate will remain at 75 cents per $100 valuation if county commissioners give final approval to next year’s $13.5 million budget.


  The budget, which commissioners have tentatively approved, also does not raise water or sewer rates and keeps the county’s solid waste fee at $75 per household.


  Operational funding for the Camden County Schools is slated to stay at $2.6 million, the same as in 2018-19 and 2019-20. The Camden Board of Education had requested an increase in local current expense funding.


  School officials have submitted two local expense options to the Camden Board of Commissioners for the 2020-21 year. One option asks for an additional $441,687 and the other seeks an additional $188,854.


  The request that school officials are calling “version two,” which asks for an additional $188,854, is designed to allow the schools to continue the staffing and services they currently have, except for two intervention teachers.


  The “version one” request for an additional $441,687 is designed to keep the two intervention teachers and add an online learning facilitator at Camden Early College.


  The current version of the budget includes $405,878 for school capital outlay, which is the same amount as in the 2019-20 budget. School capital outlay in the 2019-19 budget was $295,000.


  State law requires counties to adopt a balanced budget by June 30.


  A tax increase of some kind is likely within the next couple of years in order to cover the cost of building a new high school for the county.


  Camden Schools officials and Camden County officials are working toward placing a bond referendum for a new high school on the ballot in November.

The Z Flip's beautiful but cursed display


  I love and hate this display. When it's clean, the tall narrow screen is amazing and vibrant. Videos look outstanding. The 21.9:9 aspect ratio is also really wide, so there are black bars on the sides of most videos. I watched widescreen films like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, though, and they fit the display incredibly well.


  But once in a while, the plastic polymer coating got in the way of the screen's beauty, especially when there were fingerprints on the screen which the coating seems to attract endlessly. When I wipe smudges clean with my shirt sleeve, they don't come off as easy as a phone without plastic polymer on it.


  Then there's the crease. Ah, the crease. One thing I noticed after three months of using it is that I physically feel the crease constantly with my fingers. The Z Flip's crease cuts across the middle of the screen and if I scroll through apps like Instagram or Twitter, my finger goes over it like a car rolling over a seam in a concrete driveway. But this doesn't particularly bug me and because it's a horizontal crease instead of the vertical one on the Galaxy Fold, I actually see it less. To me, the crease is like background music at a restaurant. I notice it but forget about it after awhile. Just like how I got used to notches on phones, I am now used to the crease.

Tokyo, May 17 (AP) Shinto shrines, a go-to place for many Japanese to pray for good health and safety, have largely shuttered during the coronavirus pandemic.


  But one Tokyo shrine went online for those seeking solace.


  Onoterusaki Shrine in downtown Tokyo was livestreaming prayers on Twitter during a May 1-10 holiday, allowing those stuck at home to join rituals.


  The shrine also accepted worshippers' messages, which were printed on a virtual wooden tablet and offered to Shinto gods to keep away evil spirits and the epidemic.


  "I thought about how people can pray and have a peace of mind at a time everyone is feeling uneasy about all the news and going through major changes in their life but still cannot go out to pray. The idea is to provide a chance for people to pray from home," head priest Ryoki Ono said.


  For Machi Zama, a freelance writer, that's just what she needed. Zama prayed for her friend who recently had surgery, and everyone else experiencing difficult times, as well as for an early end to the global pandemic.


  Watching the priests perform the purification rites, she felt as if she was at the shrine, Zama said. When one of the priests faced the screen and waved a religious paper streamer, she would bow. It was like her prayers were answered, she said.


  "Wherever you are, I think it's your feelings and thoughts, the wish to pray, that's what's important," Zama said. "Whether online or offline, I don't think it matters."


  For Ono, praying in the sacred shrine is still better. He said he hoped people will visit the shrine for a real experience when it reopens. The shrine ended the online prayers last Sunday to prepare for its upcoming annual festival.


  Shinto is Japan's indigenous religion that dates back centuries and it literary means "the way of kami," which refers to Shinto gods or spirits. It's a form of animism that believes in sacred spirits residing in living things and nature, including wind, rain, mountains, trees, rivers and fertility.


  Purification is key to Shinto rituals to keep away evil spirits. Worshipers can also make a wish for traffic safety, good health, success in business or exams, safe childbirth and many other things.


  There are about 80,000 shrines in Japan. Revered as the most sacred is Ise Shrine in central Japan that venerates the sun goddess Amaterasu, the mythological ancestor of the emperor.


  Not everyone in the conservative religion agrees with the departure from the traditional in-person prayers.


  Naomi Shiba tweeted six prayers at the online shrine, in the hopes of an early end to the pandemic, for her two sons to be able to resume their work and studies, and for herself to lose some weight.


  "Perhaps this is the way to do it in the current age," she said. (AP)

MLB and the union agreed to a March 26 deal in which players would get a prorated share of their salaries during a shortened season. As part of the agreement, $170 million in salaries are being advanced through May 24. If the season is scrapped, players are guaranteed service time equal to what they accrued in 2019, a key to gaining eligibility for salary arbitration and free agency.


  Now that plans have been formulated to possibly start the season in early July in disinfected stadiums with no gate revenue, at least at the start, MLB says the current economics are not feasible. Players have said they already made a deal and see no need for change.


  But that deal is contingent on playing in front of fans at regular-season ballparks. The agreement committed both sides to “discuss in good faith the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate neutral sites.”


  Players traditionally have questioned team accounting on what counts as a baseball revenue or expense. Cincinnati pitcher Trevor Bauer speculated this week over whether an owner could increase prices of a parking garage near the ballpark the owner also controls and generate money that would not be included in the club accounts.

Also: Hertha Berlin won 3-0 at Hoffenheim in coach Bruno Labbadia’s first game in charge; Freiburg drew at Leipzig 1-1; Paderborn drew at Fortuna Düsseldorf 0-0; and Wolfsburg won 2-1 at Augsburg, where the home side’s new coach Heiko Herrlich was forced to watch from the stands after breaking quarantine to buy toiletries. Herrlich will only return after twice testing negative for the virus.


  Celebrations were muted throughout, with only Hertha’s players overstepping calls for restraint.


  “Goal celebrations are part of soccer. We’re tested so often I think they can be allowed,” Labbadia said in defense of his team.


  Even though the stadium contained less than 300 people, one of them — a camera operator behind the goal — still managed to be hit on the head by a wayward shot from Leipzig’s Ademola Lookman.


  Leipzig was grateful to VAR for ruling out what would have been a winning injury-time goal from Freiburg's Robin Koch.


  They were the first games to be played in the league since March 11.


  Earlier Saturday, the second division resumed with four games, also without fans present and amid strict distancing measures.


  South Korea midfielder Lee Jae-sung scored the division’s first goal for Holstein Kiel in a 2-2 draw at Jahn Regensburg. He celebrated by giving teammates fist bumps.


  Goal celebrations in other games were also marked by fist bumps and elbow-to- elbow touching.


  The game’s authorities were keen to restart the country’s top two divisions with several clubs, including Schalke, facing severe financial difficulties because of the suspension in play.


  Numerous polls showed a growing majority in Germany were against the resumption of the leagues. Fans are also critical.


  “Soccer without fans is nothing,” read a joint statement from several Bayern Munich fan groups after the league decided on May 7 to resume.


  Cologne fans accused authorities Saturday of prioritizing money over people’s health. A banner at Augsburg’s game against Wolfsburg said, “Soccer will survive, your business is sick!”


  There was criticism too from players over health concerns and the threat of injury with games now packed into a tight schedule.


  Players and staff have been subjected to regular testing for COVID-19. Three cases were found at Cologne, while second-division Dynamo Dresden was ordered into 14 days of quarantine after two more positive results brought its total to three last Saturday. Dresden’s game against Hannover on Sunday was called off, and the team cannot train during the quarantine period.

FORT LAUDERDALE -- The official start of hurricane season may get shifted into May in coming years, after several consecutive seasons produced storms before the current opening date of June 1.
   
 A low-pressure system near the Bahamas has been given a 80% chance of forming a subtropical storm or depression later this week. If it does, this would be the sixth year in a row to see a storm form before the official start date.
   
 Dennis Feltgen, spokesman for the National Hurricane Center, said the possibility of shifting the opening date into May is being discussed, in light of the series of pre-season storms. Nothing formal has been proposed, he said, but the increase in early storms has led to conversations on the pros and cons of an earlier start date.
   
 "NHC has taken note of the formation of named storms during May 15-31 in about half of the past 10-15 years," he said in an email Wednesday. "But, it is also aware of the lack of any such activity during May 15-31 in the preceding 30 years. NHC Is weighing the potential advantages and disadvantages of changing the official start date of the Atlantic hurricane season based on the possibility that the recent uptick in late May storms will continue."
   
 Hurricane season used to be a month shorter. In 1935, when the predecessor of the National Weather Service set up a hurricane warning network, it established a special telegraph line that operated from June 15 through Nov. 15, Feltgen said. The five months during which the telegraph line operated was hurricane season.
   
 In 1965 the season was extended to the current dates, June 1 through Nov. 30. About 97% of Atlantic tropical storm activity takes place between these dates, he said. Storms have formed in all the other months of the year, he said, with May being the most active of the non-season months.
   
 John Nielsen-Gammon, professor of meteorology at Texas A&M; University and the Texas State Climatologist, said much of the Atlantic is unusually warm now, creating conditions that would normally prevail about two weeks later in the year. But he said it's unclear whether it would be worth it to discuss an earlier start date for future seasons.
   
 "The storms don't care," he said. "The only thing that matters really is it tends to kick off people paying attention to hurricanes. That may be somewhat less relevant, since we've gotten saturated with weather forecaster information, The Weather Channel and so forth. I could understand not wanting to do it because you'd suddenly get all these existential political arguments about oh, they're just doing that because of climate change or something."
   
 The prospect of a longer hurricane season may not be the best news these days, especially when we're already getting prepared to deal with a different "new normal."
   
 But of course, nature will do what it will do, regardless of official start dates. And scientists point out that early-season storms are typically weak. They tend to form fairly close to shore, almost never reach hurricane strength and bear little resemblance to the potential monsters that form near Africa later in the season and gather power during their long journey across the Atlantic. No one expects a Dorian or Andrew to form in May.
   
 Dan Kottlowski, chief hurricane forecaster, for AccuWeather, said scientists have discussed extending the season about 15 days into May. Although initial conversations weren't that serious, he said the parade of early-season storms has changed that.
   
 "A few years ago, they were joking about it, but over the last five years or so, I've seen more serious discussion," he said. "If you look at the past 30 or 40 years, it doesn't really make sense right now. But if this continues over the next five years or so, then maybe statistics will force us to do that."
   
 Each year since 2015 has seen a storm form prior to the official date. Last year Subtropical Storm Andrea formed May 20 far out in the Atlantic, barely held subtropical storm strength of 40 mph and fell apart a day later without threatening land. A particularly early storm arose in 2017, when Tropical Storm Arlene formed in the northern Atlantic and reached a top wind speed of 50 mph.
   
 Although early storms are typically unimpressive, an exception took place in 2018 with Tropical Storm Alberto. The storm formed May 25, achieved a wind speed of 65 mph, just 9 mph short of hurricane strength, and struck Cuba and the Florida Panhandle, leaving 18 dead.
   
 Phil Klotzbach, research scientist for Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project, said there's little reason to move up the start date. One reason we're seeing more storms early in the season, he said, is improved technology that allows scientists to better detect weak storms that quickly dissipate.
   
 "I don't think it's worth extending the hurricane season, since the continental U.S. has never witnessed a hurricane landfall prior to June 1," he said. "Also, we've only had two years in the satellite era (since 1966) where the Atlantic has had a hurricane prior to June 1: 1970 and 2016. Most of these pre-June storms are quite weak."
   
 Any change in the start date would involve discussions among the National Hurricane Center, other governmental agencies and the World Meteorological Organization.
   
 Is climate change a factor in the increase in early-season storms? It's unclear. Many scientists think global warming could lead to stronger hurricanes, but they also think it could lead to fewer of them. Warmer water fuels hurricanes, making them stronger. But climate change could increase periods of high-altitude crosswinds that tend to prevent hurricane structures from forming.
   
 David Nolan, chairman of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami, said, the warm ocean water fueling the potential storm is the result of a short-term heatwave, not the slower, longer-term effect of climate change.
   
 "Global warming and a trend in hurricane activity has not been established," he said. "You can guess, but scientifically the evidence is not there. There's no evidence we're going to have more April or May tropical cyclones because of global warming."
   
 Since most studies on climate change and hurricane predict stronger, but fewer, storms, he said, "That would actually suggest less storms than April or May."

Every section of this country knows what they need. Those of us in the Middle Belt have been struggling right from the Independence under a yoke which has become burdensome. We want states for our people. Look at Nasarawa, since it was created some people outside the state determine who becomes the governor and the indigenes hardly move to the seat and this is happening all over the place. People are coming in and killing others at will and no arrest is made. When you cry, nobody listens to you. People like us in the North want more states where our people can express themselves and live peacefully. Secondly, we want state police where our people can protect themselves appropriately. Even this resource control, there is nothing bad about it. All the federating units in this country are viable; they have adequate mineral resources that they can fall back on. If we can follow this, Nigeria will be better for it.

Bars have still not received permission to reopen.


  Food and beverage workers have been among those most hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.


  According to Homebase, a free scheduling and time tracking tool for small businesses, the total number of hours worked at establishments in the food and drink sector around the nation had dropped 40 percent by March 17 — the day that Justice and other governors issued their orders.


  Overall, hourly workers in the U.S. had already declined by 45 percent on March 17, taking a toll on the country's hospitality workers, many of whom were barely making enough to cover their month-to-month bills.


  "The food and beverage industry is not even paycheck to paycheck," Kathryn Lott, the executive director of The Southern Smoke Foundation, told Rolling Stone magazine. "It's shift to shift."


  Lott's nonprofit organization supports those in need within the food and beverage industry. It is one of multiple agencies and businesses which are providing relief funds to help out-of-work bar, restaurant, delivery and service workers as they struggle to make ends meet during the COVID-19 shutdown with no pay or severe cuts in pay.


  Gilkey said Friday that she applied for and received unemployment to help support her family while the government forced the bar closed. She also received a federal emergency loan that has kept the bar afloat.


  She declined to say the amount of the loan.


  "We didn't get much," she reported.


  She added that bars typically get $3,000 to $5,000.


  But running a small business – and a bar at that – is not always about the money.


  The hardest part of the coronavirus outbreak for Gilkey, she said, has been thinking about her regulars. She goes into the empty bar to make repairs and updates — and she thinks about them.


  One Owl Club regular is a retired Collins Middle School coach who, more than 30 years ago, was Gilkey's health teacher.


  "I don't really call them customers," Gilkey explained. "I call them my friends.


  "They really make the place. That's who makes the club. It's the people."


  She spends much of her time at her home with her 8-year-old daughter, trying to stay busy.


  "I've been praying a lot," said Gilkey. "I'm seeing a lot of things on Facebook, reading up on everybody else's lives, how they're doing.


  "I'm hanging out with my daughter, playing games, just trying to keep myself busy."


  Like all small-town places that have outlasted generations of local residents, The Owl's Club is an institution. It has its niche in local lore. It was a skating rink in 1933 and first opened as a bar, called The Tip Top Tavern, in the 1940s, she said.


  By the late 1950s, the establishment had become The Owl's Club — the kind of neighborhood bar that draws the same loyal patrons, day after day, year after year.


  Along with her well-known twin brother, local musician Randy Gilkey, Candy grew up in the Oak Hill area and graduated from the local high school.


  She bought The Owl's Club from her boyfriend, longtime bartender and owner Mark Matulis, in 2015. The couple operate the bar together and employ one full-time bartender.


  The trio know what to expect at The Owl's Club, starting at around 3:30 p.m. when the Happy Hour regulars begin to trickle in.


  "They'll just all sit around, just talk about their day," said Gilkey. "A lot of them will do trivia questions.

Twenty-three associate degree nursing students received their nursing pins at College of The Albemarle’s 48th annual pinning ceremony on May 7.


  Two graduates — Winborne Evans and Virginia Shackelford — received the Dr. L. Everett Sawyer Award, presented to the student who most exemplifies conscientiousness and zeal for learning.


  Five graduates — Brianna Borst, Holly Burcker, Jamie Mazzenga, Emily Uperti- Patti and Melissa Vann — were recognized for earning the Dr. Zack D. Owens and Martha Anderson Owens Nursing Endowment Scholarship. Students have to be enrolled full time and maintain at least a 2.5 grade-point average.


  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s pinning ceremony was held as a drive-through event. Opening remarks were provided by COA President Jack Bagwell and Lauren Judge, president of this year’s associate degree in nursing graduating class.


  Each graduate and their family members arrived in one vehicle and remained parked until the graduate’s name was called. The student then got out of their vehicle and walked up the campus’s main driveway to a table where they picked up their rose and pin. As they did so, Katie Miller, department chairwoman of the associate degree nursing program, read the student’s written message of thanks to their family and friends.


  Once all students received their pins, they each lit their Nightingale Lamp and recited the International Council of Nurses Pledge. The ceremony was broadcast via live audio stream as well as by Zoom.

Thanos was locked up most of his life since the age of 15 and spent a considerable amount of time at the Maryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown.


  In 1971, he escaped for a time from that facility by hiding in a laundry cart placed on a truck.


  As I worked the prison cell blocks back then, I often had the opportunity to talk with inmates.


  Thanos was one of them and was mentally damaged far beyond repair.


  His life had been filled from the cradle to the grave with unbelievable struggles. He grew up in Dundalk, Md.


  Thanos’ father was reported to have been abusive. The word love was most likely not used very much in his home.


  He was considered a weak inmate among the prison population because of his small stature and his tendency to dress in a feminine way. He was a prime candidate for abuse from other inmates.


  Tired of life, he attempted suicide on several occasions.


  Since Thanos was most likely victimized throughout his life, I suspect he had learned that role well and victimized others during a crime spree in retaliation.


  As our conversations mostly occurred on corridors or in cell blocks, it was obvious to me that his life was likened to some caged animal.


  B.F. Skinner, a psychologist, believed if an individual was provided with the right elements of positive reinforcement from birth, appropriate behaviors could be developed; but when those reinforcers were absent, some serious emotional disorders could occur.


  Take for instance the example of a dog. If dogs are treated well, fed well and loved, they are some of the best companions a person can have — man’s best friends.


  But imagine for a moment a dog that ends up in an environment where he is not properly nourished, is mistreated, beaten or exposed to negative situations. Soon meanness and hate become a part of that dog’s behavior, and he acts out in a vicious, unfriendly and threatening manner.


  Thanos’ nickname for himself was the “hound of hell.”


  I suspect that John Thanos did not arrive or plan to become a killer out of his mother’s womb, but somewhere along the way he would become a dangerous person.

Hertha Berlin player won’t be punished for hugging and kissing as they enjoyed a much-needed victory when German football resumed on Saturday, the Bundesliga confirmed after the match.


  In order to obtain the political green light to resume this weekend, the Bundesliga agreed strict rules to avoid the spread of coronavirus.


  Yet, while players in other games celebrated with elbow taps or solo dance routines, Hertha’s players hugged and kissed as they won, 3-0, in Hoffenheim.


   _Also read:Weird but amazing_


  Hertha started the game 13th in the table with only seven wins in 25 games and under new management.


  Their Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata kissed team-mate Marko Grujic on the cheek after their team’s first goal.


  “The fact is that this is part of football,” said Bruno Labbadia, who was named as Jurgen Klinsmann’s replacement during the lockdown. “We’ve been tested so many times that we can allow it.”


  “If you can’t celebrate anymore, the whole thing breaks down. I’m just glad that the team had reason to cheer today.”


  “Emotions are part of the game.”


  The German Football League (DFL) had presented the German authorities with a 51-page document, which convinced the federal government and regions that football could be allowed to resume behind closed doors.


  In an accompanying document sent to clubs, the DFL said hugging and hand contact in celebration of goals should be avoided and that preference should be given to “elbow or foot contact”.


  But on Saturday, a DFL spokesman confirmed there would be no punishment, as it had only offered “guidelines” on how goals should be celebrated.


  “For celebrations, only advice has been given and therefore there can be no sanctions,” a DFL spokesman said.


  As part of its programme to ensure a safe return, the DFL has tested players and coaches regularly for the virus and teams have been in quarantine for the past week.

I’m wearing a mask in public these days and staying six feet away from folks when possible.


  This I do to protect myself, although it might save you from coronavirus catastrophe, too. In my extended family, I am known as “Typhoid Larry,” the guy who never gets sick, but carries germs and viruses to the rest of the clan.


  My mask seems like an inexpensive investment in my health during the current pandemic — no guarantee, mind you, but an act that tilts the probabilities in my favor.


  We live in a world of probabilities, not certainties. If you consistently stack the probabilities in your favor, you will achieve a good result in the end. Seat belts and bicycle helmets come to mind, along with consigning the saltshaker to a closet and eating fruit for dessert or dollar-cost-averaging investments and never buying a stock whose business you don’t understand.


  Yes, you could still perish in an automobile accident, die of a stroke or suffer major financial setbacks, but it is less likely.


  Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin laid out a probabilistic approach to life in his 2003 volume, “In An Uncertain World.” Rubin made a fortune trading bonds for Goldman Sachs on Wall Street, then joined the Clinton administration as Treasury secretary where he helped to engineer the last budget surpluses ever achieved in Washington, D.C.


  Rubin found that the same probability evaluations he used to pick one bond over another were equally useful in calculating which economic policy was preferable to another.


  Twenty-five years later health experts in Washington encourage us to wear masks and to socially distance while awaiting a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. I think the economy should be opened sooner rather than later, but masks, plexiglass barriers, health screenings and social distancing likely will be a part of the new order. Get used to it.


  To mask or not has become a political act. Anti-maskers seem to view them as a sort of Star of David, an “e-mask-ulation,” a precursor to the government sending black helicopters to take away guns, livelihoods and other liberties.


  Maybe. But probably not.


  This is the same federal government which claims it doesn’t have my bank information for the stimulus check even though the routing and account numbers appear on the checks I send them every quarter.


  Pilots of government black helicopters might weigh the probability of surviving their missions after viewing the citizen with the anti-aircraft bazooka in the Raleigh Subway store last week.


  President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence should remember that if both are disabled by COVID-19, Nancy Pelosi becomes president.


  There is enough grist for the conspiracy mill to fuel suspicions of masks and future vaccinations. Yes, Dr. Anthony Fauci has 12 virus patents. Three Russian doctors working on the COVID-19 virus have “fallen” from windows. A Chinese coronavirus researcher perished in a “murder-suicide” recently.


  But if you seriously believe there is a “deep state” ruse to steal your freedoms, then raise the probability that you will survive to vote in the Nov. 3 election by wearing a mask.

Jim Justice joined dozens of other governors in ordering bars and restaurants to offer take-out or delivery only, in an effort to slow the spread of the fatal virus.

An employee of Seattle-based Trident Seafoods, tested while undergoing a quarantine, is the first person confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 in Dillingham, Alaska, a Bristol Bay community where many residents have been concerned that seasonal fishing industry workers could spread the disease to their region.


  The test results came Friday as the Trident worker was under a quarantine, required by the city of Dillingham for new arrivals there, according to Alaska's Unified Command. He was lodged in a house shared with four other workers, according to a Trident official.


  Trident arranged Saturday for that worker to leave the region. The four others have tested negative, but because they were in a house with that worker, will remain quarantined for two more weeks.


  "We are pleased that our response plan prevented this individual from interacting with the public," said Stefanie Moreland, Trident's vice president for government relations.


  Trident Seafoods is a big employer of processing workers in the Bristol Bay region, where a sockeye salmon run in the summer brings in thousands of people, many from Washington, to catch and process the fish.


  Trident does not have a processing plant in Dillingham, but the five workers are employed by Trident to support company vessels.

Beijing, May 17 (PTI) A speeding bus turned turtle after crashing into a guardrail in southwest China's Sichuan province, killing six and wounding 20 people, local officials have said.


  The accident took place on Saturday when the vehicle overturned after crashing into the central guardrail on a highway connecting Xichang to Chengdu, Sichuan provincial public security department said.


  Among the 36 people on board, two were killed on the spot and four died after being taken to a hospital.


  All the 20 injured are undergoing treatment in the hospital, including three in critical conditions, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.


  Road accidents are common in China, where traffic regulations are often flouted or go unenforced.


  Violations of traffic laws were blamed for nearly 90 per cent of accidents that caused deaths or injuries in 2015.

  For high school seniors, spring of their final high school year should be a series of special celebrations - proms, group outings and other significant moments leading up to commencement - a transition from one chapter of life to the next.


   


  Unfortunately, this has been anything but a routine semester. Everything changed just before spring break in March when schools across Texas were closed in a series of measures meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus.


   


  A few weeks ago, an air of finality set in when Gov. Greg Abbott ordered schools to remain closed through the rest of the academic year. Local school district officials are at work on a June commencement solution that not only provides a memorable experience for graduates but also preserves public health, which likely means graduations will take place outdoors with each graduate limited to a certain number of guests.


   


  We appreciate the hard work of local school districts to stage commencement exercises and congratulate the Class of 2020 on an important accomplishment. Graduation is a powerful moment in a young person's life, and one that, decades later, remains an easily retrieved memory. We also understand the reasoning for closing schools and recognize that COVID-19 has killed thousands of people across the country. The purpose here is not to diminish that stark reality.


   


  That fact cannot be taken lightly and should be kept in perspective when lined up beside missed proms and canceled athletic seasons. To their credit, some of the young people we spoke to made that point quite well.


   


  "At the end of the day, (staying at home) is really something we have to do to ensure the community is safe, our loved ones are safe and everyone around us is safe," Luca D'Amico-Wong, a Lubbock High senior, said. "I think in spite of these difficulties, and in spite of the fact that we can't be together physically right now, I think our community, as a school and as friends, we're very much rallying together."


   


  Still, for this year's class of graduating seniors, many precious memories are forever lost, and so it is worth a few moments to reflect on a three-month span unlike any other. Almost everyone can look back at their senior year of high school and smile for one reason or another. For this year's class, those smiles may in many cases be bittersweet.


   


  Spring sports were completely wiped out, meaning hundreds of local athletes missed not only on-field competition but also off-field camaraderie that only can be experienced by teammates in pursuit of a common goal.


   


  Even the chance to walk down the halls of the high school one last time or thank special teachers for the difference they made have been lost. While the academic portion might have moved online, there's been no way to recreate the social aspect and the joy that regularly comes from sharing school and life with friends.


   


  It is a big deal.


   


  We salute the Class of 2020. We congratulate you on hanging in there down the stretch and doing something that makes your friends and family proud. We know these past few months have not been easy, and we wish you well on whatever you take on next.


   


  Because no matter what that might be, this spring semester has prepared you for it.

Chager’s sentiments were supported by Aslam Khan, who first started rallying as a navigator in the 1973 Safari Rally with Didi Kalsi in a Datsun 1600sss.


  He bagged his best result in the 1984 Safari Rally with a fourth overall placing navigating Jayant Shah in yet another Datsun.


  “I feel the change is good. Nothing looks like it is going to improve in the next couple of months. It is unpredictable, and it is not safe for us to think of doing an event at this stage," Khan, who since changed seats to become a rally driver, said.


  Jasmeet Chana, whose first Safari Rally was in 2007, said he was disappointed but fully understands the implications of running the event.


  “We need to look at the safety of everyone involved in the rally. Yes, in the beginning it came as a total surprise, but later we realised the change is for all of us. Coronavirus is a serious disease and we all need to be careful. I’m looking forward to the event in 2021,” Chana said.


  WRC Safari Rally Chief Executive Officer Phineas Kimathi, told _Nation Sport_ that his team will continue to work round the clock to make sure the event will be ready and fully operational once they approach the new date.

Earth’s magnetic field is weakening, and could all but disappear within the next 500 years—exposing our planet to intense solar radiation that would scour its surface of life, Reuters.com reports. Researchers say I the geological record indicates that Earth’s * magnetic field tends to switch polarity f every 250,000 years—and that it’s about 550,000 years overdue for a swap, which typically begins with the dwindling away of the field’s force. “In the past 150 years, the strength of the magnetic field has lessened by 10 percent, which could indicate a reversal is on the cards,” says Oxford University earth scientist Conall Mac Niocaill.

Musk in the past has made his feelings clear on Bitcoin but in cryptic terms. In a podcast done in January 2020, he said that he was “ neither here nor there” on the currency. Incidentally, Bitcoin scammers have been using Musk and other high-profile Twitter accounts to trick users. Musk had this to say on such scams, “The crypto scam level on Twitter is reaching new levels, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX said in a tweet in February, before adding, This is not cool. However, with regard to Rowling’s query, it does seem like Musk is more ‘here’ than ‘there’ on bitcoin. At least for now.

On the mental and physical aspects of such a test of endurance, Stefanidi added: "We noticed that it is a great way to shut our brains off. Pole vaulters struggle with mental blocks where we won't take off the ground. This is a great way and a great game to get you to get off the ground because you have to shut your brain off and just make the bar. Sometimes you need to just do that in pole vault instead of thinking of too much.

Most of them have masks. I think (the market) is a great idea.”

  I numeri nel calcio non sono tutto, però aiutano. L'ultima immagine di festa bianconera è datata oltre due mesi fa, con Paulo Dybala esultante dopo il gol del 2-0 all'Inter. Poi è arrivato il coronavirus a sconvolgere le vite di tutti, compresi i calciatori. La Joya è guarito dopo un lungo isolamento ed è già tornato ad allenarsi, Cristiano Ronaldo è rientrato a Torino già da tempo e dalla prossima settimana potrà riunirsi ai compagni. Maurizio Sarri ripartirà da qui, una coppia che non accoppiata che non abbiamo visto sempre insieme dall'inizio in questa stagione (in Juve-Inter, per esempio, Dybala è entrato dalla panchina) ma che difficilmente ha tradito, soprattutto in termini di gol.
