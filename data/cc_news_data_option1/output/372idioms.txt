 Actor David Schwimmer said recently that he is well aware of his "privilege as a heterosexual white male" and insisted that "Friends" should be rebooted with an all-black or all-Asian cast.
 Schwimmer, most famous for his portrayal of "Ross Geller" in the hit show, "Friends," made the remarks during a recent interview with The Guardian. "Friends" has come under fire in recent years for its perceived outdated social storylines.

PHILADELPHIA — When you download Uber’s app, you agree that you’re older than 18, that you’re not using a stolen credit card to pay your driver, and — if you’re like one Philadelphia woman and fracture your spine in a car crash — that you won’t seek a jury trial against the ride-share giant.
 But, a Philadelphia Common Pleas Court judge has ruled that, because Uber can’t prove that Jillian Kemenosh actually read the company’s terms and conditions before she signed up or rode in the car that ran a red light, she can’t be forced to settle her claims behind closed doors.
 Sitting in the back seat of an Uber in March 2018, Kemenosh was more than halfway home on a four-mile trip from Columbus Boulevard to her Center City apartment when the driver of the 2010 Toyota Highlander ran a red light at 16th and Vine Streets, crashing into another vehicle.

PROSPER, Texas — When half a dozen California families arrived in a limo-style bus for a daylong tour of suburban homes for sale north of Dallas on a recent Saturday, the sun was shining but the temperature had dipped below 50 degrees. Some came unprepared for the cooler weather, shivering in hoodies, flip-flops and one in a Dodgers cap.
 “Don’t know how much walking I’ll be doing,” said Paul Paone, 57, a grandfather wearing flip-flops and shorts.
 Californians have been leaving the Golden State for decades in search of cheaper housing, lower taxes and a different way of life. According to a University of California, Berkeley poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times last year, more than half of California’s registered voters have considered leaving the state. For thousands, that search leads to Texas. California lost 1 million residents to other states from 2007 to 2016, about 2.5% of its total population, and Texas was the most popular destination, according to a 2018 report from the state Legislative Analyst’s Office. The main reasons Californians cited for wanting to leave: high housing costs (71%), taxes (58%) and the state’s political culture (46%).

The industry — the most valuable fishery in California — has been taking this very seriously, he said. “People are using best practices, like not using a bunch of slack rope or extra buoys on the surface.”
 Tension was high in light of a recent lawsuit by the Center for Biological Diversity, which threatened to restrict crab fishing. A conservation plan is now being developed to address these marine interconnections.
 The crab fishermen are treading cautiously and decided to start this season a little later, Mellor said, because there were still whales popping up in San Francisco. “If we entangled even one or two, it could’ve resulted in the season being closed all year.”
 They lost the profitable Thanksgiving rush and the most productive time to fish for crabs — when they’re just coming out of their molt. But taking care of and minding the balance of the ocean, Mellor said, is in everyone’s best interest.
 Mellor is part of what he calls a dedicated “hotshot crew” of scientists, fishermen, environmentalists and wildlife officials who got together when the entanglements first increased. Santora and Forney’s study provided the scientific baseline needed for this working group, which has been developing tools to better anticipate and avoid entanglement.
 Many say this group, which was urgently convened in 2015 by the state’s Ocean Protection Council and wildlife and fisheries officials, is the future of ocean management: Setting aside differences, sharing field notes, compiling all the different data streams and figuring out how these multiple issues overlap. Reported entanglements have since dropped off but still remain higher than before the spike.
 The scientists are now developing a website that will use all this data to forecast the areas where whales are most likely to be feeding off the West Coast. Crab fishermen could then decide where — and where not — to set their traps. Regulators could make calls on when to open or close a fishery.
 Using these new tools and thinking about the ecosystem as a whole — rather than the traditional approach of focusing on one type of fish or species at a time — will help everyone adjust to more rapid and frequent changes in the marine environment.
 They’ve created a framework, said Paige Berube of the Ocean Protection Council, to assess and manage risk in a way that can protect both ecological and economic imperatives.
 “We can protect biodiversity, protect whales and sea turtles,” she said, “and also ensure that we continue to have thriving commercial fisheries that are iconic to our coastal identity as Californians.”

The two had previously squared off twice on the BWF circuit with the World No. 25 Kashyap leading 2-0 in their head-to-head record. This time, however, he was unable to do much against Vincent, who put up a show to remember for the home crowd.
 The first game was on par till 6-6 after which Vincent upped the ante with his aggressive display. The Mumbai Trump, Kashyap kept peppering unforced errors which did not help his cause further. As the match wore on, Vincent started growing in confidence as he wrapped up the first game 15-8.
 The Indian made an effort to come back in the second game but an alert Vincent dashed his hopes to complete the 15-8, 15-10 win in front of a roaring home crowd, whom he thanked later for their relentless support.
 Having lost her first match to Michelle Li of the North Eastern Warriors, determination was writ large on the World No. 14 Zhang's face. The former India Open champion made no mistake in her meeting with Mumbai Rockets' Kuhoo Garg, who struggled with the American's exquisite placement of shuttle. Zhang's pace and power were too much for the youngster who conceded the match to Awadhe's Trump, 3-15, 4-15.
 Earlier, Kim Sa Rang and Pia Zebadiah's partnership helped make a grand start to the match for the former runners-up, Mumbai Rockets against Awadhe's strong pair of Christinna Pedersen and Ko Sung Hyun. The latter had emerged victorious in the Warriors' first tie but this time Rang and Zebadiah's quick reflexes at the net did not allow them to settle into the match as the Mumbai duo held their nerves to register a 15-9, 15-14 win.

There’s a $130 monthly homeowners’ association fee, but that’s nothing compared with Ladera Ranch in Mission Viejo, which can cost hundreds a month, Bustos said.
 Later that day, touring another palatial home with 20-foot ceilings, Bustos exclaimed: “This is Ladera on steroids!”
 She and her husband, Luis Bustos, 29, a car painter, came to Texas looking for “medical freedom” — that is, the freedom not to vaccinate their two sons, ages 9 and 4. Their older son attends public school with a religious exemption, but California made the process more difficult just as they’re about to register their younger son for kindergarten.Ashley Bustos said she worries they will miss California and her husband’s extended Mexican American family, who gather at the couple’s house on weekends.
 “I have major cold feet,” she said on the bus. “My husband says we’ll miss the beach. I say, ‘Honey, we go once a year!’”
 Bustos identifies as independent, politically. On Bailey’s Facebook page, she’s seen Texans rant about newcomers trying to “California my Texas,” but doesn’t worry about being accepted.
 “I won’t change the colors of the state” politically, Bustos said.
 But Andy Simich, 30, the one in the Dodgers cap, might. The defense contractor and former Marine is a Democrat, as is his wife, Valentina Caceres, 28, a Navy veteran he met while training at Camp Pendleton. The couple, who have a 5-year-old son and nearly 2-year-old daughter, lived in Yorba Linda until last year, when they began considering Texas.
 “The second time my truck got broken into, we started having conversations,” he said.
 They almost bought a condo in Fullerton for $500,000 in 2017, but the financing fell through, he said. During Saturday’s tour, they said they’re glad it didn’t work out.

“Bimbo Tu è un’associazione nata nel 2007 per supportare i bambini colpiti da patologie e tumori del sistema nervoso centrale ricoverati presso l’Ospedale Bellaria di Bologna – ha spiegato Alessandro Arcidiacono -. Malattie di questa portata disorientano le famiglie, che sono messe a dura prova dal senso di impotenza e dal dolore per la lotta che i loro figli devono combattere. Il sostegno e l’affetto dei genitori sono però fondamentali per dare forza e coraggio a tutti i piccoli pazienti, per questo noi di Bimbo Tu crediamo fermamente che per poter aiutare davvero i bambini sia necessario aiutare anche i loro nuclei famigliari. Questa forte convinzione ci ha dato la spinta per dare vita a PASS, il Polo di Accoglienza e Servizi Solidali che sta nascendo a San Lazzaro di Savena, a poca distanza dall’Ospedale Bellaria, e che, da fine 2020, darà alloggio gratuito a tutte le famiglie provenienti da fuori Bologna, che così potranno stare accanto ai loro figli, spesso costretti a lunghi ricoveri per le cure di cui hanno bisogno”.

 "You are either going to make a long-term investment for the next 150 years or we are not," Mr Benn said.
 "HS2 is a vote of confidence in the future, that is why businesses are so keen on it. It is a really big test for the Government."
