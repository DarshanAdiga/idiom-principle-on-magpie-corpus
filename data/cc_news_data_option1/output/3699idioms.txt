L’uomo, che inizialmente sembrava caduto a causa del cedimento di un ponteggio, secondo i vigili del fuoco intervenuti, è stato colpito da materiale edile probabilmente caduto dall’alto durante operazioni di movimentazione. Data la delicatezza della posizione, il personale del 118 ha ritenuto necessario chiedere appunto il supporto dei vigili del fuoco arrivati da Seregno e Carate Brianza con l’autoscala. I pompieri si sono calati da un’apertura del tetto della villa in costruzione, hanno raggiunto il ferito e dopo averlo agganciato al toboga lo hanno portato a terra.
