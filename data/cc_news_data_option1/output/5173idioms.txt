LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union can see a landing zone for an agreement on the so-called level playing field provisions in a Brexit trade deal, but both sides are struggling to compromise on fishing, Ireland's state broadcaster RTE said on Wednesday.
 "While both sides have a way to go, on the level playing field/state aid there is a landing zone in sight. On fisheries, both sides say that is 'very difficult'," RTE reporter Tony Connelly said on Twitter.
 "It looks as if all the energy is going into the LPF (level playing field) and once cracked, they'll barrel into the fisheries stuff. Governance, or how to solve disputes, looks like it has been more or less done."

The dollar remains at weak levels as the DXY Index is trading at a new low just above the 90 mark, a level last seen in April 2018, which analysts at MUFG Bank believe underlines high expectations that the Fed will deliver a message of continued loose monetary policy for a considerable period to come. Key quotes "We now suspect the FOMC to hold off on altering the QE composition but it remains a very close call. However, the guidance statement may well include an option to alter the composition and may suggest that the FOMC is monitoring the Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) and suggest the WAM could be changed if the FOMC believes financial market conditions are not conducive to reaching its new inflation average target. The guidance will also likely be much more explicit on maintaining the current pace of QE until labour market conditions are 'on track to reach maximum employment and inflation is on track to sustain 2% on average over time'." "Of greatest concern going into this meeting will be the lack of policy support to compensate for near-term downside risks. There is still no fiscal stimulus plan agreed and if one of the Republican candidates wins in the run-off elections in Georgia on 5 January (seen as most likely) then a large fiscal stimulus package will not materialise." "Without a QE composition change, the US dollar may rebound modestly but assuming the guidance is explicit and strongly-worded like we expect, the dollar is set to remain weak, close to current levels through the remainder of the year and into 2021."

Models have been very consistent with the surface low passing well to the southeast of the Stateline early this afternoon. But since we are on the very northern fringe of this developing system, moisture swinging around the surface low will result in more cloud cover, and the possibility to see a few isolated flurries. Hi-res models show a few flurries popping up shortly after mid-day, with chances continuing into the mid to late afternoon hours. No accumulations are expected for the Stateline, but areas to the south and east may pick up a quick inch or two before the system pulls away from the region. The combination of today's cloud cover and chilly northeasterly wind will result in highs in the low 30s. This is right around average for this time of year. I'd still have an extra layer on if you plan to be out and about this afternoon, as wind chills will remain in the mid to upper 20s.

‚ÄúPetitioner asserts that at no time did he resist any of the officers, and the officers continued to beat him for a period of time,‚Äù stated Bowman‚Äôs lawsuit.
 Bowman claimed he sustained several cuts, including a cut to his head, a fractured arm, broken ribs and other injuries.
 Bowman‚Äôs account was at odds with the Sheriff‚Äôs Office report filed at the court in support of Bowman‚Äôs arrest warrant.
 According to the sheriff‚Äôs report, Bowman refused to comply with commands to exit the automobile and ultimately ‚Äúpulled away in a violent manner in an attempt to evade arrest.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAaron then attempted to climb back in to his vehicle and over to the passenger side at which time I removed him (from) the vehicle and a brief struggle ensued,‚Äù stated the sheriff‚Äôs report. ‚ÄúAaron then began swinging his arms at me and screaming he did (do) anything wrong. Aaron then struck me on the top of the head with a closed fist. While attempting to secure Aaron in handcuffs, he pulled his arms under his body, refusing to give (the deputy) his wrist.‚Äù
 Deputies notified emergency medical services personnel in light of Bowman‚Äôs injuries and had his injuries reviewed at the scene of his arrest and at a local hospital, too.
 In his lawsuit, Bowman claimed the sheriff‚Äôs report of his arrest was ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù and ‚Äúuntrue.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúPetitioner asserts that he was not the aggressor but was actually beaten terribly by Deputy (D.) Ginn and other officers,‚Äù stated Bowman‚Äôs lawsuit.
 Bowman referred to video footage captured at Bowman‚Äôs home security camera system that showed ‚Äúan officer swinging downwards, punching Petitioner repeatedly.‚Äù
 Other defendants in the lawsuit included Sheriff Jay Russell, the city of Monroe, the University of Louisiana-Monroe Police Department, the Ouachita Parish Metro Narcotics Unit and Monroe Police Department.
 Earlier this year, Monroe police officer Jared DeSadier was arrested on criminal charges stemming from an investigation of excessive force being used in the arrest of another black man, Timothy Williams, in April. The investigation is ongoing.

‚ÄúThis is an impressive achievement which Americans should be proud of,‚Äù astronaut-turned-senator Mark Kelly said of the Dragon capsule double-header.
 Until the SpaceX flights, Russia‚Äôs three-person Soyuz capsules were the only way to get astronauts to the space station once NASA's shuttles shut down.
 NASA‚Äôs other hired crew transporter, Boeing, is scrambling to get its Starliner capsule back in action after a software-spoiled test flight in December 2019. The do-over ‚Äî again with no one on board ‚Äî is targeted for spring. If the repairs work and the capsule finally reaches the space station, the first Starliner astronauts could be flying by summer.
 Musk capped the year with a stratospheric test flight of Starship, the rocketship he‚Äôs building to carry people to the moon and Mars. The Dec. 9 demo went better than anyone imagined until a fiery explosion at touchdown. Even so, Musk was ecstatic.
 At the same time, SpaceX is expanding its Dragon-riding clientele. Late next year, SpaceX expects to launch the first privately financed Dragon flight in a deal arranged by Houston-based Axiom Space.
 Axiom's Michael Lopez-Alegria, an ex-NASA astronaut and former president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, will accompany Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe and two other paying customers to the space station. Stibbe, a former fighter pilot, was a close friend of Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003.
 Will Tom Cruise be joining them? The actor was in talks with NASA this year about filming a movie at the space station.
 ‚ÄúThis is the true beginning of private spaceflight and will get the ball rolling toward multiple private missions to orbit per year,‚Äù Lopez-Alegria said in an email. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been preaching for almost a decade __ that commercial human spaceflight is the next giant leap.‚Äù
 Two other space-travel companies ‚Äî Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic ‚Äî are still conducting test flights and have yet to set firm dates for launching customers on short flights to the edge of space and back.
 NASA is still targeting a November debut of its new moon rocket, the Space Launch System, with an Orion capsule that will launch without a crew. The Trump administration had set a 2024 deadline for the first moon landing by astronauts since NASA's Apollo program a half-century ago. Just this month, NASA introduced the 18 astronauts who will train for the moon program named for Artemis, the mythological twin sister of Apollo.
 It remains to be seen how President-elect Joe Biden might alter the lunar- landing program.
 ‚ÄúWhatever else can be said about the four years of the Trump administration, they have been positive for the U.S. civilian space program,‚Äù noted John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University‚Äôs Space Policy Institute. ‚ÄúNo prior major programs were cancelled, the human exploration program was given clear direction, and funding for existing programs was increased.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThis is a legacy that the Biden administration can build on, so that in future years there can be a continued string of successes.‚Äù

In 2002, Mangham lost to Port Sulphur in the second round, and then came five straight first round eliminations that included a 72-6 loss to South Plaquemines in Class 1A in 2007 and a 64-0 loss to John Curtis in 2A in 2009.
 So here we are.
 Even in this crazy COVID-19 year, Mangham nation is excited about its Dragons once again.
 I had the pleasure of watching Mangham upset defending state champion Ferriday last month and know this Dragon team is no fluke.
 I thought if they met again Ferriday would come out on top, but now, after watching Ferriday against Port Allen and seeing how well the Dragons played against a good Pelican team last Friday, I don't believe the Trojans would have prevented a sweep.
 This Ferriday team had some key pieces missing this year, and was the most undisciplined team Stanley Smith has had at Ferriday since he arrived in 2017.
 Meanwhile, Mangham, even with a couple of slow out of the gate performances to start the playoffs, is a very disciplined football team that will take advantage of any mistake by the opponent.
 Wilcher and his very dedicated, hard-working and very knowledgeable coaching staff have the Dragons in the state semifinals.
 And if you are wondering how excited Dragon fans are, just take a drive through town and make a stop somewhere. Just bring your mask.
 It's a different time in the state of Louisiana.
 But it's the same rich tradition in Mangham. Dragon fans are all on board. And rightfully so. This Mangham team has given them a lot to cheer about. And the ride is not over. And 2020 has been quite a ride.

Brussels, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 16th Dec, 2020 ) :The EU's 27 member countries aim to start Covid-19 vaccinations on "the same day" in a sign of unity, possibly a day or two before Christmas, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.
 Her statement to the European Parliament came as pressure mounted on the bloc to catch up with the United States and Britain, which have already started inoculating people with a vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech.
 "To get to the end of the pandemic, we will need up to 70 percent of the population vaccinated. This is a huge task, a big task. So let's start as soon as possible with the vaccination together, as 27, with a start at the same day," von der Leyen told MEPs.
 Von der Leyen emphasised that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first of six potential vaccines for which the EU has secured contracts.
 "Finally, within a week, the first vaccine will be authorised so that vaccinations can start immediately, and more will follow in the new year," she said.
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which regulates the release of medicines in the EU, is bringing forward to next Monday a special meeting originally planned a week later to discuss conditional approval for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
 EU officials said that, if that EMA meeting gives a green light, the vaccine would be authorised two days later.
 As EU citizens watched first Britain last week then the US this week start vaccinations, Germany \-- home to BioNTech and von der Leyen -- pressed for the EMA to allow the jab to be made available before Christmas.
 EU states have the option of individually going ahead with vaccinations earlier under EMA emergency rules, but the European Commission wants a coordinated roll-out across the bloc to ensure no member state is left behind.

 # Hospitals across Florida expected to have access to COVID-19 vaccine as of next week
 Christine Sexton
 News Service of Florida
 TALLAHASSEE ‚Äî About 180 hospitals across the state will have access to COVID-19 vaccines as of next week, Florida‚Äôs emergency management chief said Tuesday.
 Division of Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz said five hospitals that received delivery of a Pfizer vaccine Monday and Tuesday have reached agreements to share the vaccine with 25 neighboring facilities, usually their competitors. That means 30 Florida hospitals will have access to the Pfizer vaccine this week.
 Separately, more than another 150 facilities have been registered in a federal system for delivery of a yet-to-be-approved vaccine manufactured by Moderna. If approved Friday as expected, the Modern vaccine could be at the 150 hospitals next week.
 Florida announced 9,411 new coronavirus cases as five hospitals receive first vaccines
 As of Tuesday Moskowitz said there was no indication in a federal tracking system that a second round of the Pfizer vaccine was slated to be delivered to the state next week.
 ‚ÄúThe first week we got Pfizer, the second week it appears we are only getting Moderna,‚Äù Moskowitz said, adding that nothing has been confirmed for the third week.
 Five hospitals ‚Äî UF Health Jacksonville, Tampa General Hospital, AdventHealth in Orlando, Memorial Healthcare System in Broward County and Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami ‚Äî received their vaccine shipments this week and began inoculating front-line health care workers.
 Meanwhile, in a statewide phone call with health department officials, hospitals across the state on Tuesday were clamoring for information about the next shipments of COVID-19 vaccines and whether their facilities would be on the delivery list next week.
 Hospitals also pressed state officials about which vaccine they would receive ‚Äî the Pfizer vaccine, which requires extremely cold storage, the Moderna vaccine candidate, or both.
 For now, Moskowitz said the goal is to keep the vaccine supply bifurcated, with hospitals receiving either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine. But he said that also will be dependent on production of the vaccines.
 ‚ÄúUntil we see the ramping up of production it‚Äôs hard to make any definitive statements because we may have to make decisions on the fly depending on what we receive when,‚Äù he said.
 Overall, Florida received about 180,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week, with the five hospitals receiving about 100,000 and CVS and Walgreens pharmacies receiving tens of thousands more. CVS and Walgreens have signed an agreement with the federal government to vaccinate residents and workers at long-term care facilities. The Florida Department of Health has 20,000 doses to supplement the CVS and Walgreens efforts.
 DeSantis said Monday he expects Florida to receive about 365,000 Moderna doses after the vaccine receives emergency authorization, which is expected Friday.
 To keep track of the vaccines, the state on Tuesday issued an emergency rule that requires all COVID-19 vaccine providers to report information to the state, including information about the race and ethnicity of people being vaccinated and the names of the facilities where they were vaccinated.
 The emergency rule requires that the information be reported to the state within 24 hours, but Department of Health Secretary Scott Rivkees said officials would prefer the information to be reported in real time as part of tracking efforts.

This week's news of HBO Max's availability on PS5, Xfinity X1, and Flex is yet another loud and clear reminder that the streaming service still is not available to Roku users. This has been a point of contention for prospective HBO Max users since the platform launched earlier this year. The company line on the matter is still something to the effect of "it's still in the works," but it's unclear from either camp where in the negotiations process the HBO Max-Roku deal is at this point or why it's not coming together the same way other deals, like the one with Sony Entertainment for the PS5, are coming together.

Evatt knows, however, they need to get results on the pitch if they are going to win back their fans in the long term.
 "The owners have a vision," says Evatt. "They want to go on a journey and I want to be a big part of that. That means Bolton eventually getting back to where I believe it belongs, which is at least the Championship.
 "We need to do the right things on and off the pitch so we can regain the trust and respect of our supporters again. They need to trust what we're doing and we need to reconnect with the town and the community. But we can only do that if we are winning on the pitch, and it's good that we're starting to do that now.
 "It hasn't been easy. We had to sign 22 new players in the middle of a pandemic, with a salary cap that has come into place and doesn't really help us. The players can't socialise outside of the club either, so it's hard to build relationships with a completely new squad.
 "We've faced a lot of challenges and it was always going to take time. We're building a a whole new brand and a whole new identity for Bolton Wanderers, and that doesn't happen overnight. It's about following the process.
 "The owners here have put a huge amount of faith and belief in me. They believe in what I'm doing and the process behind it. They understand how difficult it can be, and it will continue to be."

El entrenador de Colo Colo, Gustavo Quinteros, espera aprovechar el golpe sufrido por la UC en Copa Sudamericana y el amplio conocimiento que tiene de los cruzados a la hora de enfrentar este s√°bado el cl√°sico en el Estadio San Carlos de Apoquindo.
 El elenco de la franja viene de ser eliminado anoche en los cuartos de final del citado certamen continental, a manos de V√©lez Sarsfield, luego de una dolorosa derrota 1-3 en la precordillera (global 3-4).
 Consignar, adem√°s, que Quinteros dirigi√≥ el a√±o 2019 al cuadro precordillerano, alcanzando el t√≠tulo del Campeonato Nacional. ‚ÄúConozco al cien por ciento a todos sus jugadores, los tuve a casi todos‚Äù, indic√≥ en rueda de prensa.
 ‚ÄúConozco sus fortalezas, debilidades que son muy pocas y tenemos que trabajar para aprovechar y contrarrestar muchas posibilidades que el rival nos va a proponer. Es un buen equipo, con buenos jugadores, y hay que tratar de aprovechar con nuestras armas las deficiencias que puedan llegar a tener, que hemos analizado y estamos entrenando", agreg√≥.
 El estratega de origen argentino apunt√≥ tambi√©n que la idea no es refugiarse ante uno de los l√≠deres del torneo. ‚ÄúHay que salir a atacar al rival y sacar frutos de eso, sin dejar de pensar que vamos a enfrentar a uno de los tres mejores equipos del pa√≠s, ahora se liber√≥ o qued√≥ eliminado de un torneo internacional y se va a enfocar de lleno en el nacional, eso puede ser m√°s dif√≠cil‚Äù, dijo.
 "Ser√° un partido muy disputado, muy intenso, es lo que queremos proponer, intensidad, no dejar jugar a los buenos jugadores que tiene. El d√≠a del partido el que est√© m√°s claro, el que decida mejor y que tome las mejores decisiones tendr√° m√°s posiblidades de ganarlo, as√≠ que vamos a aprovechar. Estamos tratando de enfocarnos en lo que podemos hacer", complement√≥.
 Incluso, el otrora seleccionador de Ecuador y Bolivia cree que la eliminaci√≥n copera del rival "puede afectar a algunos jugadores en la parte an√≠mica... no s√© cu√°ntos d√≠as o si afectar√° al disputar el partido con nosotros, tambi√©n puede pasar que al quedar fuera de un torneo internacional se enfoquen en el otro objetivo que es siempre, o durante los √∫ltimos a√±os, el objetivo principal, el Campeonato Nacional‚Äù.
 Para terminar, Quinteros manifest√≥ la posibilidad que el experimentado volante Jorge Valdivia pueda jugar algunos minutos ante la UC. ‚ÄúHoy hizo f√∫tbol y es m√°s posible que debute. Hicimos f√∫tbol 35 minutos, lo hizo todo y bien. Yo creo que terminar√° bien toda la semana de trabajo, ojal√° que se sienta bien y que si pueda entrar pueda aportar su calidad al equipo‚Äù, sentenci√≥.

Updates with Pompeo's schedule, details, background)
 By Humeyra Pamuk
 WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has come into contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus and will be quarantining although he has tested negative, the U.S. State Department said on Wednesday.
 "Secretary Pompeo has been identified as having come into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID. For reasons of privacy we can't identify that individual," a spokesperson for the State Department said.
 "The secretary has been tested and is negative. In accordance with CDC guidelines, he will be in quarantine. He is being closely monitored by the department's medical team."
 The State Department did not immediately answer further queries about how Pompeo came into contact with the infected individual. The Washington Post on Tuesday reported that Pompeo canceled a speech he was due to give at an indoor holiday party the State Department had organized.
 Pompeo did not have any appointments or event in his public schedule sent out by the State Department late on Tuesday. President Donald Trump was due to hold a Cabinet meeting at 11:30 a.m. EST (1630 GMT), according to the White House schedule.
 Pompeo's Tuesday holiday event, for which the Post said 900 invites were sent out, drew wide criticism. Earlier this month, Democratic senator Bob Menendez called on Pompeo to cancel the event to avoid "reckless health risk" to department employees and event staff.
 The District of Columbia tightened up its guidelines for restaurants, businesses and gatherings as coronavirus cases across the United States as well as Washington have been back on the rise. The latest guideline on the district's web site says indoor gatherings may not exceed 10 people.
 More than 72.66 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 1,636,000‚Äã have died, according to a Reuters tally. In the United States, there have been around 16.7 million confirmed cases and over 304,000 deaths. (Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk and Pete Schroeder; Editing by Franklin Paul and Jonathan Oatis)

While you‚Äôre tuned to a dog show, consider golden retriever coloring along with Pyrenees, even lighter colored German shepherds. Of course, not all farm dogs you meet are descendants of only these breeds, but most seem to be if visual testimony is sufficiently convincing. Some of these breeds have generational testimonies of behaving well with cattle, even protecting them or herding them away from danger. For dogs with these genes, welcoming visitors at the farm gate is not only second nature, but sheer fun and excitement.
 Size as well as coat coloring seems somewhat standardized for most canine gatekeepers, again, the result of their ancestors‚Äô specifications. Compile an average of 15 or 20 of the farm dogs you have met recently (or forever) and their size will probably be in the neighborhood of 80 pounds. Occasionally, one that should weigh 80 pounds will waddle up to greet you weighing 120 pounds. Shame on his master-mistress. His or her gatekeeping duties may be coming to an early end.

 ‚Äú2021 promises to be as much of a space exploration bright spot, perhaps even more," said Scott Hubbard, NASA‚Äôs former ‚ÄúMars Czar‚Äù now teaching at Stanford University.
 Although the coronavirus pandemic complicated space operations around the globe in 2020, most high-priority missions remained on track, led by the U.S., China and the United Arab Emirates in a stampede to Mars in July.
 The UAE's first interplanetary spacecraft, an orbiter, will scrutinize the Martian atmosphere. NASA‚Äôs Perseverance rover is set to land Feb. 18 at an ancient river delta and lakebed where microscopic life may have once flourished. The rover will drill into the dry crust, collecting samples for eventual return to Earth.
 China‚Äôs orbiter-rover duo Tianwen-1 ‚Äî quest for heavenly truth ‚Äî also will hunt for signs of bygone life.
 The European and Russian space agencies skipped the 2020 Mars launch window, their life-sniffing Mars rover grounded until 2022 because of technical issues and COVID-19 restrictions.
 China also set its sights on the moon in 2020, landing and then launching off the lunar surface in December with the first moon rocks collected for return to Earth since the 1970s.
 Japan brought back pieces of asteroid Ryugu ‚Äî its second asteroid batch in a decade. More asteroid samples are on the way: NASA‚Äôs Osiris-Rex spacecraft vacuumed up handfuls of gravel from asteroid Bennu in October for return in 2023.
 Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, meanwhile, was buzzing in 2020. In May, it became the first private company to put people into orbit, an achievement previously claimed by just three global superpowers. The two test pilots were the first NASA astronauts to fly a new brand of spaceship in almost 40 years and the first to blast off from Florida since the shuttle program ended in 2011.
 In November, four more astronauts rode a SpaceX Dragon capsule to the International Space Station. Three weeks later, SpaceX launched its biggest cargo shipment yet to the space station for NASA.

Updates with new source, comments, material)
 By Richard Cowan
 WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - U.S. congressional negotiators on Wednesday were "closing in on" a $900 billion COVID-19 aid bill that will include a new round of stimulus talks and extended unemployment benefits, a person familiar with the talks said.
 The source said the deal also focused on providing aid to state and local governments. But it was not clear what form such aid would take, since Republicans have resisted another round of direct payments to those entities.
 "Other avenues" were being discussed to deliver such aid, the source said, without providing details. The aid bill is not expected to include new protections for companies and universities from lawsuits related to the pandemic, the source said.
 Congressional leaders made substantial progress toward finalizing a new coronavirus aid plan during talks that stretched into the night on Tuesday. Facing a deadline to avert a government shutdown on Friday night, lawmakers also want to come up with some way to address the pandemic's heavy human and economic toll.
 Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he felt optimistic.
 "We made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief package," McConnell said as he opened the Senate. "We need vaccine distribution money, we need to re-up the Paycheck Protection Program to save jobs, we need to continue to provide for laid-off Americans."
 PPP is the federal loan and grant aid to small businesses suffering from the pandemic.
 "It's not a done deal yet, but we are very close," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.
 With pressure building to deliver more help - and a U.S. death toll that has passed 304,000 - McConnell and House of Representatives Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy met twice on Tuesday with Democratic counterparts House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.
 The size of the direct payments for individual Americans was not immediately clear.
 WEAKENING ECONOMY
 The apparent breakthrough comes at a key moment for a U.S. economy that is clearly weakening after an initial rebound from a historic recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year. Consumer spending, buoyed through the summer and early fall by the first rounds of federal assistance totaling more than $3 trillion, has hit a wall in the fourth quarter as new restrictions to thwart COVID-19 limit business activity and households begin to hunker down.
 Commerce Department data on Wednesday showed retail sales fell unexpectedly sharply in November, with consumer outlays on goods and services showing softness across the board.
 As lawmakers worked on the deal, officials at the U.S. Federal Reserve were also meeting to debate whether additional stimulus from the central bank was also warranted. The Fed has already cut interest rates to near zero and is buying $120 billion of bonds a month to ensure borrowing costs for consumers and businesses remain cheap and help encourage spending.
 Fed policymakers will unveil their decision on Wednesday afternoon. Chair Jerome Powell - who has repeatedly said additional fiscal stimulus is needed to support the economy until the time a vaccine is in broad enough use to encourage consumers to come out of their shells - will discuss the Fed's decision afterward at a news conference.

2020 has been one of the worst years in modern history. Too many people have suffered, too many have died, too many businesses have been ruined and too many families are experiencing financial and emotional hardship. The COVID-19 pandemic and the world‚Äôs response to its very existence is now one of the defining moments of our lifetimes. Just like after 9/11 when domestic security measures in our daily lives changed forever overnight, so too will the way we handle hygiene, crowds, events, entertainment, travel and healthcare for years to come.
 For Louisiana, this new reality puts our backs against the wall and forces us to compete like never before.
 Our state economy depends largely on energy, hospitality, manufacturing and health care‚Ä¶ and of course, government. For decades, the needs of state government have been placed above the needs of the other private sector economic sectors. Don‚Äôt believe me? Just look at the results.
 The state budget has avoided cuts during this pandemic because the federal government stroked a big check and will likely avoid cuts in the next budget when Congress does the same thing again in 2021. Meanwhile, the few tax and tort reform bills in the last year to specifically help a struggling energy sector either died in the session or were vetoed by the Governor, the hospitality industry is still stifled by mandated shutdowns and promised cancellations of major events throughout next year, and a host of manufacturing plants are contemplating shutdowns or scale backs due to shrinking world volume and changes made to our Industrial Tax Exemption Program.
 Some in the media and elected office are prone to say oh well, it is what it is, stop complaining about the new reality we all live in.
 They view the business community as an easy target rather than a valuable partner. Some of those even go a step farther and try to convince us that this economic drop is a good thing‚Ä¶ that the more we can chase away traditional energy and manufacturing jobs, the better off our state we will be in the long run. Rubbish.

The PM Johnson told his senior ministers that a no-deal Brexit is still the most likely outcome, the spokesman added further.

"The accused person was seen with one of key witnesses in a case for which he is on bail. He was subsequently arrested while he was seated in the witness vehicle," Sirihwindi testified.      "Bail is opposed because there are high chances he will escape and interfere with witnesses, since he has already shown the propensity of doing so. Just three or four days after he was granted bail, he was already interfering with witnesses knowing that he was not supposed to do so."      Asked whom he contacted over the mobile phone or interfered with directly, Sirihwindi said it was Dzehonye.      "He called him, made an appointment to meet and they did meet. The witness and the arresting detail said so. We also have evidence that he was persuading Admore Nhekairo to meet him."      For Mafume, Advocate Thabani Mpofu assisted by Tonderai Bhatasara proposed bail of Z$30,000 with conditions including: not to interfere with witnesses including Edgar Dzehonye, continue to reside at his given address and continue to report at the police Anti-Corruption Unit once a week.      Mpofu asked Sirihwindi how much was found on Mafume, or his car, and the investigating officer indicated US$65.      The lawyer also challenged Sirihwindi to tell the court who owned the Econet number 0772616889, on which the supposed calls to meet were made. The police officer said he had not verified, although indicating that Mafume told him it belonged to one Getrude Dumba.      "So, at this stage you have no objective evidence to show that the accused called Dzehonye," Mpofu quipped.      The lawyer said Mafume was called by Dumba and went to her vehicle.      "She was seated in the driver's seat and there was no-one in the passenger seat. The car has tinted back seat windows. He didn't see anyone. He talked to Getrude Dumba while outside the car, and at that stage your officers came to him," Mpofu told Sirihwindi.      Mpofu said Dumba was at the scene when Mafume was arrested. It was also not denied that the Econet number Mafume was communicating with is registered to Dumba, the lawyer said.      He accused the police of trying to set-up Mafume, who is also a lawyer.      Mpofu said the police claims that Mafume was going to hand over money were not backed by evidence.      "Upon his arrest, he had US$65, and not the US$1,000 he was allegedly going to give away," the lawyer said as he asked magistrate Nduna to free Mafume on bail.      Sirihwindi said he could not comment on the issue of money, because he was not present when Mafume was arrested.      Nduna will give his ruling on the bail application Friday.

"We had a slow start, but we are starting to pull it together now, which is credit to the players and the staff," Evatt says. "Anyone who sees Bolton Wanderers in League Two expects them to win every game and the title at a canter.      "But the club were used to losing games. Bolton were only one day from going out of business completely and not existing anymore, that's how close the club came to not being there. We've seen with Bury and Macclesfield how quickly it can happen.
 "Turning around that mindset and mentality is a huge challenge, and people do underestimate that."
 Years of ownership issues saw the club slip into a state of disrepair. From the heights of European football and FA Cup semi-finals in a golden period 10 to 15 years ago, Bolton were at the point of oblivion last season, before being rescued at the eleventh hour.
 Relegation to League Two for just the second time in their history could not be avoided, but it feels like things are finally turning around.

Biden‚Äôs team has limited experience with staffing a physical office during the pandemic. His campaign went all-virtual in mid-March, clearing out its Philadelphia headquarters and sending staff back to their families in Washington, New York and beyond. His transition team plotted out his path to power entirely online.
 The closest Biden‚Äôs team has come to experimenting with in-person work was election night, when a small selection of masked and socially distanced aides in Wilmington, Delaware, monitored returns in hotel conference rooms, a far cry from running a White House 24/7.
 Even now, the most prominent use of the 100,000-plus square feet (9,290 square meters) of office space reserved for the transition is for Vice President- elect Kamala Harris to receive the highly classified President‚Äôs Daily Brief.
 Telework is possible for some White House staff, and improvements in both secure and unclassified video conferencing have been made over the last two decades. But the lack of in-person coordination could pose an additional challenge to the new government facing a multitude of crises.
 Further complicating matters, the Biden team must devise health and safety protocols from scratch. The Trump administration was, at best, a cautionary tale in how not to run a workplace during a pandemic.
 Despite relying on an aggressive testing regimen that is not available in other workplaces, the West Wing under President Donald Trump has been the locus of at least two significant outbreaks of COVID-19 since Trump himself came down with the virus five weeks before Election Day.
 Besides the first family, the dozens in Trump world who have tested positive include the White House chief of staff, the vice president‚Äôs chief of staff, the White House press secretary and the president‚Äôs campaign manager. Still, more aides have had to isolate after potential exposure. The full scale of the infections is not publicly known.
 The problems stemmed in large part from the Trump White House flouting its own guidelines for COVID-19 safety, including holding large events, allowing frequent travel and above all not requiring face masks. The Biden team believes that some of the greatest risk can be mitigated simply by adhering to scientific advice: holding safer events, requiring face coverings and continuing regular testing.

He remains on administrative leave pending the conclusion of a criminal and administrative investigation, according to State Police Lt. Nick Manale, the troop‚Äôs public affairs officer.
 Manale said the State Police Bureau of Investigations began investigating a use of force incident involving Brown in October 2020 after State Police were named in a civil lawsuit alleging harm by a certain trooper using excessive force on May 30, 2019.
 State Police discovered Brown helped Ouachita Parish sheriff‚Äôs deputies arrest a suspect on that date and began an administrative investigation. During the Internal Affairs inquiry, State Police suspended the administrative probe and initiated a criminal investigation.
 ‚ÄúAs the investigation continued, detectives learned that Brown engaged in excessive and unjustifiable actions during the incident and failed to report the use of force to his supervisors,‚Äù Manale said.
 The charges against Brown recalled a similar lawsuit against Troop F in federal court alleging that State Police and others were responsible for the death of Ronald Greene, a West Monroe man whose family accused Troopers of using excessive force and lying about the incident on May 10, 2019.
 The circumstances surrounding Greene‚Äôs death and the excessive force allegations are now the subject of a federal civil rights investigation.
 In October, former State Police Superintendent Col. Kevin Reeves retired amid public calls for his resignation in light of the excessive force allegations that surfaced during the Greene case. After Reeves retired, Gov. John Bel Edwards tapped State Police Col. Lamar Davis to serve as the State Police Superintendent.
 Concerning Brown‚Äôs arrest, Davis said, ‚ÄúThe public trust and responsibility bestowed upon us as law enforcement professionals is of the utmost importance.
 ‚ÄúWe owe not only the public we serve, but also the dedicated men and women of our department a just and timely response,‚Äù Davis added.
 Fourth Judicial District Court records show Aaron Larry Bowman, 45, of Monroe, filed an excessive force lawsuit on Sept. 21, seeking damages from State Police, the Ouachita Parish Sheriff‚Äôs office and others. In that lawsuit, Bowman claimed the sheriff‚Äôs Special Crimes Apprehension Team (SCAT) pulled him out of his automobile and that he was ‚Äúdragged to the ground, face down and officers began to hit and kick him.‚Äù

 And despite Biden‚Äôs win, Republicans still have it easier than Democrats in Georgia. For the runoff elections, Loeffler and Perdue simply need to reprise their November turnout, which was higher than Democrats‚Äô. ‚ÄúFundamentally, this is still a state that wants to be a little bit Republican,‚Äù the GOP strategist Liam Donovan told me.
 But the give-people-money approach is widely popular across the country and across party lines.

Roughly one- third of the Georgians Davidson meets haven‚Äôt heard about the elections before, he estimates, but he‚Äôll keep making the case. He needs them to show up on January 5, these suburbanites who are often excluded from voter outreach, and left out of the national conversation. Without them, Democrats may not be able to win.

Episcopal Church membership peaked at 3.4 million in the 1960s, a pattern seen in other mainline Protestant bodies. This decline has accelerated, with membership falling 17.4% in the past 10 years.
 As a rule, the crisis is worse in the Northeast and the Midwest, while losses have been slower in the Sun Belt and some parts of the West. In terms of worst-case scenarios, the Diocese of Northern Michigan remains open for business, but reported an average attendance of 385 in 2019. That's the whole diocese.
 "The news, friends, continues to be not good, very bad, alarming, four horsemen of the apocalypse, dogs and cats living together, bad," noted the Rev. Tom Ferguson of St. John's Church in Sandwich, Massachusetts. He is the former academic dean of Bexley Seabury Seminary in Chicago.
 "We have more parishes with an average attendance of less than 10 persons than we do with congregations with attendance of 300 or more," he wrote in an online essay entitled "The Collapse Is Here." Many of these "Groundhog Day" reports fail to take into account "other demographics, such as we are about 87% Anglo when the United States is about 62% Anglo. ...
 "We are old and white in a missional context that is less old and less white."
 How old? The Episcopal Church had the highest average age among the 20 faiths charted in the 2017 to 2019 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, said political scientist Ryan Burge of Eastern Illinois University. The average Catholic is 50, the average nondenominational evangelical is 49 and the average atheist is 42. The average Episcopalian is almost 59.
 "If you took the membership rolls of every ECUSA church ... and grabbed a random person from that spreadsheet, the most likely age of that person would be 69. For a Mormon, the modal age is 29," wrote Burge at Religion in Public, a blog he co-founded.
 "Generational replacement is the key factor that buoys the size of churches. ... If life expectancy stays around 78 years old, that means that the average Episcopal church would lose half its current membership through death by 2040. Are there enough children to make up for those losses? Again, the data says that is unlikely."

"The Islamabad zoo is now completely closed for both public and officials," Saleem Shaikh, a spokesman for the ministry of climate change told _AFP_.
 "Both the bears will be flown to a sanctuary in Jordan."
 Shaikh said the move was arranged with the help of Four Paws International ‚Äî the same group that spearheaded the relocation of Kaavan whose plight championed by singer and Oscar-winning American actress Cher.
 She flew to Pakistan to see the elephant's departure, and then to Cambodia to watch him arrive.
 The ailing health of Kaavan, an overweight, 35-year-old bull, highlighted the woeful state of Islamabad's zoo, where conditions were so bad that the Islamabad High Court in May ordered all animals to be moved.
 Two lions died during their relocation when zookeepers attempted to pry them from their pen by setting ablaze piles of hay.
 An ostrich also died in the move.
 Islamabad Zoo, previously Marghazar Zoo, was established in 1978 on 10 hectares of land as a home for indigenous species.
 Authorities now plan to expand it as a wildlife conservation centre.
 With little legislation to safeguard animal welfare, zoos across Pakistan are notorious for their poor conditions.
 In 2018, some 30 animals died within months of a new zoo opening in the northwestern city of Peshawar, including three snow leopard cubs.
 ## IHC irked over delay in transfer of bears
 Last week, the Islamabad High Court was irked due to the delay in the transfer of the two Himalayan bears to Jordan.
 Bubloo and Suzie were to be moved to the Al Ma‚Äôwa animal sanctuary in Jordan but the zoo authorities impeded the December 6 transfer.
 Four Paws had also stated that it was "surprised" on the sudden cancellation of export permit.  
 The judge remarked that the lives of the two bears are in danger and advised the board against making it an ego issue.

The Indian BSE Sensex Index, which is weighted by free-float market capitalisation, comprises the 30 largest and most liquid Indian stocks and thus reflects India's most important industrial sectors. In local currency, the Indian Sensex has been in an intact bull market movement and enjoys medium and long-term relative strength, economists at Commerzbank report. Key quotes "From the higher-level technical perspective, the index has been in a very long-term bull market movement comprising buy signals, upward thrusts and trend-confirming consolidations. The current bull market cycle started at 8050 points in March 2009. In January 2020, this trend led the Sensex to then all-time highs at levels around 42274 points." "During the 'Corona bear market movement', the bull market trend was left, and the index was pushed to 25658 points in a sell-off. After reversing upward, the Sensex established an intact steep uptrend (trend line currently around 42450 points), which led the index to new all-time highs, and we even saw an upward acceleration in November 2020." "The Sensex currently exhibits a strongly overbought technical situation both short and medium-term, which means we are likely to see a consolidation and significantly diminishing upward momentum." "Overall, a continuation of the bull market movement and technical price potential up to 50000 points seem to be on the cards for 2021."

Forgoing full-court flashiness and disdaining dazzling displays in the half-court set, the businesslike approach of the Friendswood girls‚Äô basketball team is serving it well. After losing a five-point decision to Pasadena Dobie in their season opener, the Lady Mustangs have won nine consecutive games, and there seems to be no relenting. For those who‚Äôve taken notice, they‚Äôre well-aware that head coach Daron Scott‚Äôs team has been dismantling foes in decisive fashion. In its current win skein, Friendswood is averaging 60 points per game and allowing just 34 per outing. Friendswood recently improved to 5-0 in District 22-5A games with a 67-29 victory over La Porte Tuesday night, a triumph which has been par for the course in league play. The Lady Mustangs‚Äô other league victories have been secured by margins of 49, 56, 44 and 25 points. ‚ÄúWe have really hung our hat on being good, defensively, and the girls have bought in to that,‚Äù Scott said. ‚ÄúI have a lot of girls that I can rotate at different positions. ‚ÄúI think the other factor is that we‚Äôre a pretty mature team. Ashlyn Mason and Ashlyn Ryall have been with me for a lot of years. Those two are my leaders, and it all starts with them.‚Äù Mason is a bulky 5-foot, 11-inch senior post player who can control the middle while Ryall is versatile guard, and a recent commit to Friends University, who can score inside and outside. A strong supporting cast provides Scott with numerous options. ‚ÄúI have other seniors like Rakel Hutchinson and Noelle Chidester, that are great contributors as well,‚Äù Scott said. ‚ÄúAnd then we‚Äôre yet to add our point guard (Jocelyn Green), who broke...

The other semifinal matchup as No. 2 Mangham hosting No. 6 Kinder, which upset No. 3 Loreauville 21-14 Friday.
 Two years after not making the playoffs, the Mangham High Dragons are one game away from playing for a Class 2A state championship.
 I cannot imagine what it must have been like in Mangham in 2018 when the Dragons went 3-7 overall and 1-5 in district.
 Last year in Scott Wilcher‚Äôs first season, Mangham ‚Äî ranked No. 4 after going 8-2 in the regular season ‚Äî fell to No. 20 Loreauville 37-34 in the second round.
 I say I can‚Äôt imagine because Dragon football is everything to most people in Mangham.
 Mangham in 2018 may be similar to LSU in 2020.
 I can actually remember driving through Mangham five and six years ago around this time and the excitement of the football oozing out all over the place.
 In 2015, Mangham advanced to the Class 2A finals as the No. 8 seed, falling to Kinder 35-20.
 In 2014, the Dragons were the No. 1 seed, falling to No. 2 Haynesville 16-0 in the Class 1A finals.
 There was more heartache in 2013, as No. 1 Haynesville defeated No. 2 Mangham 42-21 in the finals of Class 1A.
 That‚Äôs three straight years in the finals in two different classes.
 In 2002, Mangham lost to Port Sulphur in the second round, and then came five straight first round eliminations that included a 72-6 loss to South Plaquemines in Class 1A in 2007 and a 64-0 loss to John Curtis in 2A in 2009.
 So here we are.Even in this crazy COVID-19 year, Mangham nation is excited about its Dragons once again.
 I watched Mangham upset defending state champion Ferriday last month and know this Dragon team is no fluke.
 Mangham, even with a couple of slow out of the gate performances to start the playoffs, is a very disciplined football team that will take advantage of any mistake by the opponent.
 Wilcher and his very dedicated, hard-working and very knowledgeable coaching staff have the Dragons in the state semifinals.
 And if you are wondering how excited Dragon fans are, just take a drive through town and make a stop somewhere for gas, food or a break. Just bring your mask.
 It‚Äôs a different time in the state of Louisiana.
 But it‚Äôs the same rich tradition in Mangham. Dragon fans are all on board. And rightfully so. This Mangham team has given them a lot to cheer about. And the ride is not over. And 2020 has been quite a ride.

Today, according to Pew Center Research, only 20 percent of adult Americans say they trust the federal government. Trust in government depends importantly on the integrity of the state election officials who manage the process, count the votes, and report the results. Without audits, their integrity cannot be confirmed and trust in the federal government likely will erode. Advantage in future elections goes to those politicians willing to turn election laws inside out in order to get the desired outcomes.
 In addition to more tolerance for fraud in coming elections, the American people can expect the following from the new administration in Washington .
 First, men and women of good character will not run for public elected office because any incumbent they might challenge likely has shaped the election laws and process to personal advantage.
 Second, the socialist state that Joe Biden will impose and enforce requires large increases in taxes and deficit spending. More and more economic and financial transactions will be ‚Äúoff the books‚Äù to avoid any sales taxes or income taxes owed. Deals will be made in cash with no paper trails and no banking records. In 2018 the so-called ‚Äúunderground economy‚Äù was estimated at $2.25 to $2.46 trillion which represents 11-12 percent of GDP. In November alone deficit spending by the federal government reached $207 billion. Our children and grandchildren will bear the burden of managing somehow to pay the interest owed on trillions of dollars of debt. A $30 trillion public debt with a 3 percent interest rate makes for $900 billion interest payments every year.
 Third, residents of cities and states that are strapped for cash to pay their operating expenses and have to raise taxes to cover the shortfall will relocate to other cities and states where taxes and regulations are more reasonable. Taxpayers who do not relocate will reposition their investment portfolios to shelter their returns in business-friendly places. With half of its residents dependent on government handouts, the City of East St. Louis Illinois died in the 1960s when no one was left to energize the local economy. Today, Baltimore is in a similar condition. Other major cities face the same grim conditions.

 Authorities didn‚Äôt link the shooting to the massacre at Charlie Hebdo immediately. They were closing in on the fugitive brothers when the first alerts came of a gunman inside a kosher supermarket. It was a wintry Friday afternoon, and customers were rushing to finish their shopping before the Sabbath when Coulibaly entered, carrying an assault rifle, pistols and explosives. With a GoPro camera fixed to his torso, he methodically fired on an employee and a customer, then killed a second customer before ordering a cashier to close the store‚Äôs metal blinds, images shown to a hushed courtroom.

 Shepherd ran for the post in 2006 and said it was ‚Äúmy dream‚Äù job. He lost that race, however, but he said he was pleased that his seat mate in the Louisiana Legislature, Richmond, won the prize.
 Why run now, though? Shepherd said he sees an opportunity to talk about lessons learned, obstacles overcome and public policy roadblocks that shouldn‚Äôt exist. ‚ÄúEnfranchisement and representation matters,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at running because I know what it‚Äôs like to be counted out.

Not nearly as helpful would be his home base of Baton Rouge, which resides in the northern end of a winding congressional district where Jefferson and Orleans parishes make up 70 percent.

The new owners at Bolton were won over by Evatt in the summer. Just 39, Evatt had only retired from playing in 2018, but in his first managerial job he managed to lead Barrow back to the Football League for the first time in nearly half a century, finishing as champions of the National League.
 It is not often a manager will leave a promoted club, but for Evatt the opportunity of Bolton was just too big to turn down.
 "It was a tough decision," Evatt remembers. "I loved my time at Barrow and what we achieved there was brilliant. I think the world of their fans and everyone at the club. It gave me a platform to show what my teams can do. To get promoted after 48 years was an exceptional thing to achieve.
 "It was strange going back there earlier in the season, especially with no supporters. But I might have got a lot of stick from them, so it saved me in that respect! I cant speak highly enough of that club and everything they did for me.
 "But you don't get opportunities like this very often. I had a conversation with the owner [Sharon Brittain] and she told me the vision she had. After the initial phone call I was sold, and I wanted to come here and be a big part of hopefully getting the club back to where it belongs."
 Bolton lost their first three on the spin this season, and managed just two wins in their first 11 games. But Evatt always had faith that his own methods would come good. In his career he has learned to back himself.
 "I've learned that I really have to believe in the way I want to play and to stick to it, because you do get challenging times," he says. "I had them this season, and I had them at Barrow, too. I lost six on the spin at one stage, and when we won the league we only had seven points from nine games.
 "When you have doubts and are asking yourself whether or not you need to change, the answer is 'no'. You need to have more belief and to back yourself in what you're doing. What we've seen in recent weeks is that if you get better at what you do, things will change and change quickly."
 As well as facing old club Barrow this season, Evatt came up against former manager Ian Holloway when Bolton met Grimsby in October - playing out a 0-0 draw.

 "During the conversation, the parties exchanged views on the Middle East settlement issues amid the normalization of Israel's relations with several Arab states," the ministry said.
 The Russian side stressed the importance of the restoration of Palestinian national unity on the basis of the political platform of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the interests of establishing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

Google, like other competing cloud services, is using mobile Safari due to Apple's restrictions on cloud gaming apps that mean platforms like Stadia can't exist in their current form on the App Store. Unlike Nvidia's GeForce Now or the planned mobile web version of Microsoft's xCloud, however, Google Stadia has a free tier without restrictions and now offers two free-to-play games available (Destiny 2 and Super Bomberman R), with more to come. That means anyone with a Gmail account looking to try Stadia can give it a shot on an iPhone or iPad with minimal effort.

_Billings Gazette crime and courts reporter Phoebe Tollefson shares some of her most memorable stories from 2020._
 A look at the life of the woman who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in Billings in 2018 aimed to introduce readers to a real person and the family grieving her death ‚Äì something present in every case that too often doesn‚Äôt get the attention it deserves.
 An important function of local newspapers is to closely cover institutions and individuals in power, including the judicial branch. Voters need to have access to detailed information about any judicial misconduct case, which is why The Gazette covered the complaint against Judge Ashley Harada as it developed.
 A sentencing hearing in June for a teenager who sped head-on at another driver while suicidal in 2018 showed the devastation that comes from losing a loved one ‚Äî in particular a young person ‚Äî to violence. He survived but the other driver was killed. Before sentencing the 18-year-old to prison, the judge said, ‚ÄúThere is palpable pain in this room, and it sits on both sides of the aisle.‚Äù
 COVID-19 has upended many aspects of normal life, but some of the people most vulnerable to the disease are incarcerated. Not only does the disease spread more easily in congregate living situations, but people in jails and prisons suffer from chronic health problems at higher rates, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. One man jailed in Yellowstone County on nonviolent charges tells us what it is like to worry about his health behind bars during a pandemic.
 As unsupported allegations of widespread voting fraud circulated this year, including from the White House, litigants took to court across the country ‚Äî some over fears of disenfranchisement, others saying they needed to take action to protect the integrity of elections. Expert testimony during a trial in Yellowstone County revealed that over a decade and more than seven million ballots cast in Montana, there was just a single confirmed instance of illegal voting.

Fifty-four people were arrested for allegedly running a fake call centre in west Delhi‚Äôs Moti Nagar and duping foreign nationals by impersonating as officers of law enforcement agencies, police said on Wednesday. The accused have duped more than 4,500 people to the tune of ‚Çπ100 crore, they said.
 Police got information that an illegal call centre was being operated from Moti Nagar and it was targeting foreign nationals and illegally inducing them to transfer money through Bitcoins and gift cards, a senior police officer said.
 ‚ÄúThereafter, a raid was conducted and 54 people ‚Äî 45 men and nine women ‚Äî were arrested. Eighty-nine desktops and a server set-up found at the spot were seized,‚Äù Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) Anyesh Roy said.
 During interrogation, the accused disclosed that they contacted foreign nationals, including US citizens, posing as officers of law enforcement and other government agencies such as the US Social Security Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Marshals Service, the DCP said.
 They used to tell them that their bank accounts and other assets are being frozen as their details have been found at a crime scene and there are bank accounts running in their names using which illegal transactions have been made to drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia, Mr. Roy said.
 ## Threatened with arrest
 They also threatened the victims with immediate arrest. Once the victim becomes apprehensive, they used to give them two options. One was to go for a legal action and the second option was to go for an Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR), which would be faster and easier, the police said.
 When the victim chose to go for ADR, they asked them to share all the details of their assets, including bank accounts and the amount of money in those accounts. Later, the victim was told that there was only one way to safeguard their assets and they would have to either buy Bitcoins or Google gift cards with their entire money in their bank accounts
 If the victim agrees to buy Bitcoins, the accused induce them to convert all the money in their accounts to Bitcoins and transfer it to the wallets operated by them, saying that it is a safe government wallet. If the victim agrees to buy gift cards, they told them to share the number of the cards stating that it will be linked to their new bank accounts.
 The mastermind of the call centre was managing the operations from Dubai.

 Republicans labored to keep the price tag for the long-delayed rescue package in check, seeking to prevail in a battle over help for state and local governments, while capping the cost of bonus jobless benefits and direct payments sought by Democrats.

 The level is even below the 44.5 feet mark - the level that the Kerala Irrigation Department officials had told their counterparts here in the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board that they would maintain for the city‚Äôs water needs.
 The Kerala Government had reduced a couple of years ago the water level in Siruvani and other reservoirs by 1.5m or five feet citing safety after floods.
 The loss of five feet water equalled 15% reduction in storage or 25 days‚Äô supply. Now, the loss has increased by five to 10% and that means a reduction in storage of another 10 days‚Äô supply, to say the least, the Corporation sources say.
 Or, in other words, Siruvani Reservoir will have water not until June but only till May because of the reduced storage level and this will have a cascading effect on Pilloor and other water sources as the Corporation diverts water from such sources to meet the shortfall in Siruvani-fed wards, the sources say and add that Siruvani caters to at least 20 wards in full and another 10 wards in part.
 Had the Kerala Government allowed the water level to touch the full reservoir level, as it did prior to 2018, Siruvani water would last till July. This would help the Board and the Corporation tide over crisis even in a poor South-West Monsoon year.
 But, this is no longer possible as under the current situation the Siruvani water will meet the city‚Äôs requirements only for a shorter duration.
 And, the Corporation and the Board that gradually reduce the quantity of water drawn from Siruvani from 80 million litres a day from March or April will have to start an early reduction in supply to keep the Siruvani supply going, the sources add.

 PARIS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - A French court found guilty on Wednesday 14 accomplices of the French Islamist militants behind the January 2015 attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine and a Jewish supermarket in Paris.
 Among the 14 was Hayat Boumeddiene, former partner of Amedy Coulibaly who killed a policewoman and then four people in a Jewish supermarket.
 One of three suspects to be tried in absentia, Boumeddiene was found guilty of financing terrorism and belonging to a criminal terrorist network. She is thought to be alive and on the run from an international arrest warrant in Syria, where she joined Islamic State.
 Coulibaly was himself an associate of the gunmen behind the deadly attack at the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015.
 The accomplices were found guilty on different charges, ranging from membership of a criminal network to complicity in the attacks. Terrorism- related charges were dropped for several of the defendants who were found guilty of lesser crimes.
 Sentencing will follow shortly.
 The trial has reopened one of modern France's darkest episodes, with the attacks marking the onset of a wave of Islamist violence that has killed scores more since. (Reporting by Tangi Salaun; Editing by Richard Lough and Gareth Jones)
