WASHINGTON (AP) — Murtice Sherek is not excited about Joe Biden.
 The Minnesota Democrat, a 79-year-old retired nurse, preferred another candidate in the presidential primary. She also worries about Biden's age, 77. But anxious about another four years of President Donald Trump, she says she's willing to go to any length to ensure Biden wins this fall.
 “I don’t really give a damn what I have to do. If I have to carry signs on the streets, if I have to carry my old friends to the polls, I’ll do it,” Sherek said. “This just can’t be. Trump is a sick man.”
 Roughly three months before Election Day, a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that Biden's supporters are less enthusiastic than Trump's — both about the campaign itself and about their candidate — although the Democrat's coalition may be equally motivated by anxiety.
 Still, the poll reveals an American public at odds with Trump on wearing masks, on balancing restrictions to stop the virus with efforts to help the economy and on fully reopening schools. And voters give Biden higher marks on many positive traits that apply to leadership in the age of the coronavirus, including honesty, capability and caring for Americans.
 Sherek's assessment of the candidates highlights the nuanced motivations underlying the so-called enthusiasm gap, which has raised concerns among Biden's allies who worry the deficit could undermine his candidacy once voting begins.
 While interest in the presidential campaign is high across the board, just 31% of Biden supporters say they're excited, compared with 42% of Trump supporters. Biden's coalition is fueled by more negative emotions: 72% of Biden supporters, but 52% of Trump supporters, say they feel anxious about the 2020 campaign. The same disparity exists for frustration with the election, 65% for Biden supporters and 45% for Trump's.

During four days in the witness box last week, Heard claimed Depp flew into jealous rages and turned into violent alter ego the "Monster" under the influence of alcohol and drugs. She accused him of slapping and hitting her and throwing bottles at her "like grenades," and claimed that she often feared for her life during their relationship.

She said Depp was “a hopeless addict who repeatedly lost his self-control and all ability to restrain his anger.”
 “Permeating all of the evidence in this case is the character of Mr. Depp himself -- his well-documented evidence of violence and destruction over his adult life which have occurred when he was under the influence of drink and drugs.”
 She said Depp "was subject to irrational mood swings and abnormal behavioral patterns, which would not have been present when Mr. Depp was clean and sober, and Mr. Depp has a name for this metamorphosed entity — namely, The Monster.”
 Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.
 The former spouses have both been in court throughout three weeks of testimony at the grand neo-Gothic court building, though Depp did not attend on Monday morning. His lawyer is due to sum up on Tuesday.
 Lawyers, journalists and members of the public have heard lurid details of the couple’s tempestuous relationship, including prodigious drinking and drug consumption, furious arguments, hurled objects and a deposit of excrement left in a bed — whether by dog or human is disputed.

LONDON (AP) — A lawyer for British tabloid The Sun said Monday that Johnny Depp abused Amber Heard during their relationship, committing acts of violence fueled by misogyny and unleashed by addiction to alcohol and drugs. Attorney Sasha Wass was summing up at Depp’s libel case against the newspaper over an article alleging he physically abused ex-wife Heard — a high-stakes celebrity trial in which the reputations of both former spouses are at stake. Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the newspaper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, at the High Court in London over an April 2018 article, which called him a “wife-beater.” He strongly denies being violent to Heard. The case is due to end Tuesday, but judge Andrew Nicol is not expected to deliver his ruling for several weeks. In closing arguments, Wass said the newspaper’s defense “is one of truth -- namely that Mr. Depp did indeed beat his wife.” Wass said there was “overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behavior, cataloged over a three-year period.” She said Depp was “a hopeless addict who repeatedly lost his self-control and all ability to restrain his anger.” “Permeating all of the evidence in this case is the character of Mr. Depp himself -- his well-documented evidence of violence and destruction over his adult life which have occurred when he was under the influence of drink and drugs.” She said Depp \"was subject to irrational mood swings and abnormal behavioral patterns, which would not have been present when Mr. Depp was clean and sober, and Mr. Depp has a name for this metamorphosed entity — namely, The Monster.” Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February...

Dabei ist Gold eigentlich keine besonders gute Geldanlage. Schaut man sich an, wie stark sein Preis im Zeitverlauf mitunter schwankt, kann man ins Grübeln kommen, warum oft von «wertstabilem» Gold die Rede ist. Das Argument wiegt umso schwerer, als die Goldanlage nur von Wertsteigerungen profitiert. Regelmäßige Erträge wie Zinsen oder Dividenden gibt es nicht. Aber Gold hat einen Vorteil: Es ist selten. Das Edelmetall gilt vielen als Krisen- und Inflationsschutz, weil es nicht beliebig vermehrt werden kann.

Editor's note: While Harold Bubil takes some time off, we'll reprise some of his popular columns. This column originally ran on Sept. 17, 2017.
   
 Maybe only politicians and pro football coaches endure more public scrutiny than the men and women who make their living forecasting, preparing for and reporting on weather events.
   
 They include meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center, whose nuanced forecasts, subject to the vagaries of wind and water, are often misinterpreted and sometimes imprecise; county and state emergency managers, who have to weigh the evidence and order costly and inconvenient evacuations, when appropriate; and TV meteorologists and weather reporters, who have to translate complex data for mass audiences.
   
 Hurricane Irma, also known as Irmageddon, showed that slight deviations in a cyclone's track can have a huge impact on its effects -- and expose the "weather industry" to criticism.
   
 Irma -- the ill-tempered granddaughter of 1960's Hurricane Donna -- pretty much followed the forecast tracks issued by the NHC until it reached the Florida Keys. The mystery all week, in advance of the U.S. landfall on Sept. 10, was just what would happen after the storm turned northward. Would it track up the east coast of Florida, the west coast or up the middle of the peninsula?
   
 The NHC's forecast on Sept. 9 was that the hurricane would parallel the Florida coastline as a category 4 event, devastating Southwest Florida's waterfront cities with 140 mph winds and storm surges of 10 feet or more.
   
 Instead, it went inland at Marco Island and rapidly weakened. Passing to the east of Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte, North Port, Venice, Sarasota and Bradenton, gusts barely reached 80 mph, resulting in some flooding, not much property damage, and a whole lot of snapped oak tree branches.
   
 The predicted storm surge after the storm passed also fizzled out.
   
 All of which left locals, in a near-panic just two days earlier, counting their blessings -- residents of Monroe, Collier and Miami-Dade and other coastal counties were not as fortunate -- while waiting for the power to come back on. As Sarasota once again avoided a direct hurricane impact, some people might question if all the preparations and evacuations were worth it.
   
 So how will emergency managers convince someone who evacuated to South Carolina to make prudent decisions the next time?
   
 "That is the most difficult thing we do, without question," said Wayne Sallade, who retired in February after nearly 30 years as Charlotte County's emergency manager, and now teaches emergency management at Colorado Mesa University.
   
 "People don't understand the subtle variances in hurricane forecasting. They don't know what a difference of just 20 miles makes. This is no different than Hurricane Charley (in 2004). This storm didn't take a hard right turn (up Charlotte Harbor and over Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte). It was off-track slightly to the east of where the official forecast had it."
   
 To those who would second-guess the forecasts and evacuation orders, Sallade, in his typical fashion, minced no words.
   
 "Rather than being grateful that they still have a home to come back to, and that the officials and first-responders aren't pulling lots of bodies out of houses where people refused to evacuate, they need to just appreciate that every effort was made to protect their lives.
   
 "I know it is frustrating. I know it was expensive to go to Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas or wherever, but it was necessary."
   
 Why? Irma threatened, and eventually affected, almost the entire state, Sallade explained, and there was not enough space in certified storm shelters to house everyone under a mandatory evacuation order. Many people stayed put, moving to shelters or the homes of friends or relatives who lived outside of the evacuation zones. Combined with the millions who left the state, few people were left stranded.
   
 Sallade followed, and posted on Facebook, the forecasts from the storm's formation to its termination.
   
 "I considered it a remarkable forecast," he said. "The fact it went right of track and degraded so very quickly was a blessing, not a screw up."
   
 The weather is a tough business. "They are damned if they do and damned if they don't," said Sallade, whose weather-related posts on Facebook (search for "Wayne Sallade") have a large and dedicated group of readers.
   
 "The emergency manager either does too much too soon, or too little too late," he said. "Never exactly on the money."
   
 He also says the slogan of the EM should be "Semper Gumby," or always flexible.
   
 After all, the only certain thing about hurricane forecasting is uncertainly, "and there is only a 50 percent chance of that," I once was told by James Franklin, chief of cyclone forecasting at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

The Sun’s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia — where Depp’s finger was severed in contested circumstances — and the couple’s downtown Los Angeles penthouse, which was trashed during the couple’s altercations.
 Wass said that the first year of the couple's relationship, during which Depp was sober, was “idyllic,” but that the violence started in 2013 after he relapsed.
 During four days in the witness box last week, Heard claimed Depp flew into jealous rages and turned into violent alter ego the “Monster” under the influence of alcohol and drugs. She accused him of slapping and hitting her and throwing bottles at her “like grenades,” and claimed that she often feared for her life during their relationship.
 Heard’s evidence was backed by witnesses including her sister Whitney Henriquez, who said she had seen Depp hit Heard “multiple times” during a fracas at the couple’s Los Angeles apartment in March 2015.
 Depp, who gave evidence for almost five days, denies all the allegations and claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to “a crime scene waiting to happen.” Several current or former employees gave evidence backing his version of events, and former romantic partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder said in written witness statements that he had never been violent to them.
 He acknowledged using a wide variety of drugs including marijuana, cocaine and opioid painkillers, but denied drugs made him violent.
 Summarizing the defense case, Wass said that “a deep misogyny … lay at the root of Mr. Depp’s anger.”
 “He created a misogynistic persona of (Heard) as the stereotype of a nagging woman,” Wass said. She said Depp branded Heard “a gold-digger, a shrew and an adulterer” in order to discredit her.

SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - Today the Suncoast will transition to the west wind pattern that you may recall we had several week ago. This summer weather pattern favors a coastal shower in the morning or early afternoon before the storms move inland and grow larger in the afternoon and evening. As we transition today, our winds start out of the south and then become more southwest by later in the day. The pattern will become reinforced by high pressure building over the Suncoast and further reducing the rain chances by mid-week. Without the cooling rains there will be more hours of heating and day-time high temperatures will rise. The southwest wind wind will also blow over the Gulf and onto land and thereby increase humidity. The combination of higher heat, increasing moisture and lower rain chances will drive up the “feels like” temperatures by late mid-week.In the Atlantic we are tracking a large cluster of storms that the National Hurricane Center is giving a 90% chance for developing into a tropical system. Over the week it will drift west and impact the Lesser Antilles by Wednesday. Most long range models tend to keep the system in the Atlantic waters. We have in interest in know the location and strength of the system later this week.Copyright 2020 WWSB. All rights reserved.
