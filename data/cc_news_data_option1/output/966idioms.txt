Fleming’s job is part sound engineering, part hospitality. Lots of musicians travel with a sound engineer, and Fleming said once the show starts, a lot of his job is helping support those folks.
 “We’re here to get them what they need,” he said. “I’m there to solve problems if and when they come up.”
 Doing sound for his bands led to a job with Moon over Montana, a company that does sound and site builds at music festivals. Fleming then spent almost a decade working at the Willson as the assistant tech director.
 Two years ago, when the Rialto reopened and began hosting shows again, Fleming was asked to come on board. When the Missoula-based entertainment company Logjam Presents took over booking at the Rialto in the fall of 2019, he was asked to stay on the team.
 After two decades on the job, Fleming said his favorite part of a show is seeing the audience react to the music.
 “I try to take the moments in right when the show gets started,” he said. “The light hits, the sound hits ... it’s about the experience.”
 Fleming said he’s especially thankful to his mentors throughout the years and to Logjam, a company he said he’s proud to be a part of.
 “I owe a lot to the people that trained me,” he said. “It’s never a one man show.”

Red Cross workers arrive near the scene of a Kenya Airways plane crash in a swampy area close to the village of Mbanga Pongo, 23 km (14 miles) east of the city of Douala, May 7, 2007. A Kenya Airways plane that crashed after takeoff in Cameroon with 114 people on board is largely submerged in a swamp and there is no chance of survivors, Cameroon's civil protection service said.
 Just before a warning sounded, said the report, instead of correcting to the left, the Captain turned further right, increasing the bank and ultimately sending the plane into a spiral.
 The report also brought out some “shortcomings in the way the crew worked as a team”, adding that the crew also took off without authorisation from air traffic control at the Douala Airport.
 The then KQ Managing Director Titus Naikuni expressed some of the airline's reservations with the report, noting that its findings that the pilot had not properly engaged the autopilot after take-off were not factual.
 “One of our reservations is to do with the autopilot, the crew resources management and safety programme implementation,” Mr Naikuni said at the time.

Examinations can be especially stressful for compliance staff. That’s because the bank’s compliance and risk management function is most definitely under the microscope during the examination process. Federal and state regulators are obligated to conduct a series of exams in order to evaluate how well the bank is implementing its system of internal risk controls to ensure that the bank’s board and management are operating the bank in a safe and sound manner. Federal regulators must also confirm that the bank is complying with consumer protection laws and regulations. Because risk management principles of safety and soundness and consumer protection are at the heart of the compliance function, the pressure is on during exam time.

Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has requested the Confederation of African Football (Caf) to postpone the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification games pitting Kenya against Comoros owing to the risk of Coronavirus infections.
 Harambee Stars are primed to host the Islanders in Nairobi on March 25, and then travel to Moroni for a rematch six days later, in fixtures whose results will determine whether Francis Kimanzi's charges qualify for the continental showpiece in Cameroon.
 "We cannot take chances in light of the government's directive," confirmed FKF's secretary-general Barry Otieno.
 The government has banned conferences and meetings consisting of more than 15-people of international nature for a month as a way of curbing the virus. Flights from specific affected countries have also been banned, a decision that rules out Japan-based striker Michael Olunga.
 And in a related development, Otieno has confirmed that the Kenya U-16s' trip to Spain has also been cancelled. The team was set to participate at the MIC tournament in readiness for the Africa Cup of Nations Cup qualifiers and Cecafa matches.
 Also, FKF has requested Caf to postpone the visit of its inspectors, who were expected to check on the safety measures of both the Nyayo Stadium and Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, ahead of the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifiers.

The R8F’s Roku interface is efficiently laid out and is extremely easy to navigate, even if I have a few nits to pick with it. For starters, it requires too many steps to change inputs (I regularly switch back and forth between a computer feed and over-the-air TV), and I don’t like having Plex as the only option for streaming movies off of my NAS box—I’d much prefer they add VLC to the mix.
 Roku just updated the OS to include a more than decent channel guide. It was a nice surprise when I updated another Roku TV I’m testing, but I do wish there was an option to limit it to just showing favorites. Instead these are placed at the top of the list and you must scroll to find them. Also, there is currently no way to manually add a favorite, they’re added by Roku based on your usage. Give me the option to curate my own favorites, thank you.
