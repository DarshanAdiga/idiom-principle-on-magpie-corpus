Martin, aged 40 and from Handsworth, was handed an indefinite jail sentence in 2011 for gun possession, robbery and conspiracy to commit GBH. He doesn’t know when or if he will be released.
 Speaking of the pain of missing out on being a father to his teenage daughter, he said: “I have a 19-year-old daughter and I miss being a father.
 "I’ve missed out on her growing up. There are loads of cells here for you if you go down the wrong road."
 "I was up to no good as a teenager. I was proud of being from Handsworth but proud in the wrong way (being in conflict with people from other areas).
 “Most of my ‘friends’ back then are dead or in jail now. No-one comes to visit me and I’m locked up for 23 hours a day."

Milano, 3 ott. (Adnkronos) - È stata inaugurata questa mattina al Museo del ciclismo Madonna del Ghisallo di Magreglio (Como), la mostra 'Magnifico', una rassegna dedicata a Fiorenzo Magni nel suo centenario. Al Museo del Ghisallo, che sorge accanto al Santuario della Madonna protettrice di tutti i ciclisti, è intervenuto l'assessore all'Autonomia e alla Cultura di Regione Lombardia, Stefano Bruno Galli, grande amico del ciclismo "e delle sue forme di espressione artistica-culturale-sociale e imprenditoriale motivo di orgoglio, unico, per la nostra grande Lombardia che pedala da sempre anche in scia a grandi miti come Fiorenzo Magni".
 "Un eroe nella storia del ciclismo e di tutto lo sport - ha detto l'assessore - Magni è il 'Leone delle Fiandre', così chiamato per avere vinto tre volte la più suggestiva e appassionante tra le superclassiche del ciclismo, il Giro delle Fiandre: conquistare le Fiandre è come vincere un campionato del mondo, è l'ambizione e il sogno di ogni ciclista. E Magni vi trionfò per ben tre anni consecutivi (1949, 1950, 1951), in quel leggendario decennio breve, dal 1948 al 1956, durante il quale Magni vinse di tutto. È un personaggio immenso che siamo orgogliosi di avere adottato in Lombardia. Esempio di coraggio, capacità, forza, tenacia e rispetto, doti applicate da lui al mondo dello sport, del lavoro e della famiglia".
 L'assessore regionale alla Cultura ha ribadito come "queste iniziative del Museo del Ghisallo, che ha aperto anche una 'stanza virtuale' correndo al passo con i tempi digitali, fanno seguito a un lavoro fatto in collaborazione, che ha avuto grande successo, lo scorso anno con il Centenario di Gianni Brera. Il tributo a "Magnifico" ci porterà dritti verso un 2021 ricco di iniziative e di percorsi culturali in tandem con un territorio da sempre devoto al ciclismo. Guardando al nostro presente e volgendo lo sguardo al futuro, Fiorenzo Magni - ha aggiunto - deve diventare un modello virtuoso per tutti noi. Era infatti noto per la sua tenacia e noi di tenacia oggi abbiamo un grandissimo bisogno per uscire dalla crisi successiva alla pandemia. L'immagine di Fiorenzo Magni con la clavicola rotta che stringe i denti in salita, dobbiamo mettercela sul comodino".

Personal injury attorney Stephen Barnes and his niece Elizabeth Barnes died in a plane crash in Genesee County, New York, on Friday, his former law partner Ross Cellino said in a statement.  
 Cellino — who with Barnes founded the famed New York law firm Cellino & Barnes, which became iconic across the region for its catchy jingle and prominent billboards — confirmed the identity of the victims.
 Barnes, a registered pilot, was flying with his niece in a small airplane heading from Manchester, New Hampshire, to Buffalo, New York, when the plane crashed close to its destination.
 The plane was registered to a company that shares an address with Cellino & Barnes, the Associated Press reported.
 Genesee County Sheriff William Sheron told reporters that the plane was "pretty much disintegrated" and there was "not much left" of the wreckage.
 "Right now, there's no bodies to be recovered," Sheron said.
 Law enforcement did not identify the victims, only saying that a man and woman were on board and there were no survivors.

Picture Rocks, Pa. – How did the town of Picture Rocks get its name? Henry W. Shoemaker tells the legend in his 1901 book, "Pennsylvania Mountain Stories."
 For five or six centuries, American Indian chieftains in Loyalsock and Muncy Valleys painted their victories on the rocks, according to the Shoemaker legend.
 "Had they been carved in the rocks, some trace of them would have been discovered by the early Scotch and English settlers," Ethel M. Cruse wrote in her book "History and Pictures of Picture Rocks Pennsylvania."
 Around 1760, a Seneca chief named Wolf's Pathway quashed an insurrection. He fought and won a nighttime canoe battle on the Susquehanna River near Nippeno Park, according to the Shoemaker legend.
 To commemorate his victory, Wolf's Pathway commissioned his cousin Fisher Fox to paint the battle scene in present-day Picture Rocks.
 Legend has it, one summer morning Fisher Fox was painting the rocks when he heard singing in a foreign tongue. A party of French settlers arrived in ox- drawn wagons and stopped to watch him work. They decided to settle there, and lived in their wagons until they could build one-room cabins.
 "The settlers were not worried about an Indian attack as this was part of a tract that had been paid for long before the settlers arrived," Shoemaker wrote.
 The men spent most of their time hunting and killed nearly 100 buffaloes the first month.
 A beautiful French woman named Georgie Dupre became interested in the rock mural. Fisher Fox invited Georgie, a married woman, to sit with him on his birch pole scaffolding as he painted, according to the Shoemaker legend.
 When Fisher Fox had to go to the mountains to retrieve more rocks for paint, Georgie begged to go with him. Georgie thought they'd make it back before sundown but a terrible rainstorm hit.
 "They found shelter in a mountain cave where they remained so long that Georgie in fear of her husband's wrath decided to leave her husband's settlement and followed Fisher Fox to the main camp of Chief Wolf's Pathway," Shoemaker wrote.
 The chief was furious when he saw Fisher Fox with the French woman. He knew Fisher Fox would not be welcome back to finish his painting. He kicked them both out of camp.
 Two braves escorted the couple to a canoe on the Susquehanna River near Shamokin Dam. They were given enough food for 10 day and shoved downriver, according to the Shoemaker legend.
 When another storm struck, Fisher Fox grabbed a hanging elm branch and left Georgie and the canoe to their fate in the raging waters.
 Legend has it Georgie crashed onto rocks mid-stream and was rescued by two German bird hunters the next morning. They took her to a pioneer settlement in Clinton County, where she remarried a man named Balzer Minnich.
 Georgie was captured by Native Americans and taken to their encampment. There, she reunited with her former husband from Picture Rocks, also a captive.
 Her ex-husband killed a sentry and begged her to escape with him, but she refused. He tried to scale the stockade wall but was shot by a guard. He fell and broke his neck, dying instantly.
 "The furious Indians rushed to their captive, and finding Georgie unbound, one of the braves struck her with his tomahawk inflicting a horrible wound," Shoemaker wrote.
 "In her dying breath, she told her slayers that she had not wanted to escape, but her former husband had tried to compel her to go," Shoemaker wrote.
 The chief called for revenge on Georgie's killer and blamed the deed on her ex-husband, according to the legend.
 "Thus Georgie Dupre Minnich died surrounded by sympathetic Indians, after detesting the entire race since her betrayal by the artist of Picture Rocks, Fisher Fox," Shoemaker said.

“However, like with Thiago Alcantara, Liverpool Football Club are – and will continue to – follow all protocols relating to COVID-19 and Mane will self- isolate for the required period of time.”
 Now, £35m man Jota is set to get the nod top replace Mane and could be thrust into the limelight against a team he knows well from his time at Wolves.
 Jota has impressed in his three appearances for Liverpool so far with three impressive run-outs from off the bench.
 Now Klopp looks set to put Jota in against Villa, most likely choosing him over Takumi Minamino who has also been performing well this season.
 Our colleagues at the Liverpool Echo have taken a look at the side that could face Villa.
 They believe that Liverpool could field close to a completely changed team for the Villa Park clash.
 But there will be some survivors from Thursday, not least Virgil van Dijk at centre-back. He was replaced on the hour by Joe Gomez, who should start alongside the Dutchman with Joel Matip still out.

George Gross BreedOctober 3, 1938 - September 13, 2020George Gross Breed passed away on September 13th 2020 at the age of 81 from complications of lymphoma surrounded by loving family at his daughter's home in Sebastopol. George lived most of his life in the Bay Area and there are few trails where he has not placed his foot, few beaches he has not strolled, few peaks he has not climbed and few waterways he has not paddled. Born in Piedmont in 1938 he grew up duck hunting at his grandfather's duck lodge in San Leandro and at his much-loved family home in the Santa Cruz mountains. At UC Berkeley George studied sociology, was a member of the crew team and a member of Theta-Xi fraternity until his graduation in 1965. From there he earned his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1968 he married Deborah Jenks and they settled together on Russian Hill where they raised their daughter Courtney.George worked as a lawyer for the mortgage insurance company PMI until his retirement in 1997. Much of his later years he either travelled the world, served on boards such as MCDS, The Urban School, St. Francis Hospital and The Bancroft Library, took classes at the Fromm Institute or voraciously read books. George took great delight in the company of his friends and family, in particular his daughter, her husband and his two granddaughters, his camp mates and other members of the Bohemian Grove and The Family Farm. George moved in with his daughter's family in December, 2019 with the knowledge that he did not have long to live. After nine months in their care, George passed away peacefully surrounded by his loving daughter, son in law and granddaughters. He will be remembered as a kind, gentle, intelligent, adventurous, independent, generous, and prepared man. The saying, "When there is a need call Breed" resulted from his readiness to help, either with his Swiss army knife, map, flashlight, walking pole, windbreaker, saline solution or anything else he could fit in his fanny pack or the trunk of his car. We will honor his wishes to have his ashes spread under his hammock at the family cabin in the Santa Cruz Mountains where there will be a small private ceremony for his close family. Donations in his honor can be made to help restore the fire torn Big Basin State park, which his grandfather helped turn into a state park www.sempervirens.org

A Stage 2 Investigation Report by the council’s monitoring officer Julie Newman concluded that his posts were “antagonistic and aimed to dehumanise and were incendiary and offensive”, and amounted to a breach of Paragraph 3(j) of the Member’s Code of Practice relating to respect.
 However in a report to the meeting, Independent Person Steve Atkinson ruled he is “not sure” the use of ‘swarms’ is antagonistic, and that he had “reservations about the view that the two comments are ‘incendiary’, although they are very likely to ‘offend’ the average person”.
 Mr Atkinson said a “more major breach” is the fact he has “unreasonably” elected not to engage in the complaints process, which could be a breach of sections 2(d) and 3(f) of the code relating to accountability.
 Cllr Williams told Ms Newman he would not respond to the complaints “as he was concerned that they were vexatious” and wanted the complainants’ names and addresses before agreeing to respond, which was not granted due to concerns he would pass on personal details to a third person.

The National Academies’ priorities will be considered by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as it drafts its own recommendations. At the panel’s Sept. 22 meeting, CDC staff presented side-by-side maps, showing how closely the Social Vulnerability Index mirrors COVID-19 cases and deaths.
 State and local public health departments will have flexibility in how they implement the recommendations, said committee Chairman Dr. José Romero, Arkansas’ health secretary. Minorities are overrepresented in healthcare and other essential industries, so prioritizing those groups — in theory — should increase access for Black and Hispanic people.
 What’s most pressing now, he said, is the need to start explaining the independent checks in place to make sure vaccines are safe. Sharing vaccine safety data when it’s available will boost confidence among groups hesitant to get the shots, he said.
 “Among the Latino population in my state, I’m hearing terms like ‘experimentation.’ People say, ‘We don’t want to receive this until it’s shown safe in other populations,’” Romero said. “You can have the best vaccine in the world, but if people don’t have confidence in that vaccine, it will do no good. It will sit on the shelf.”

Thomson Reuters Corporation (TRI) shares on Friday's trading session, dropped -0.52 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $80.12 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of $0.75 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $1.99 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is 161.70% and predicted to reach at 9.25% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out- come was -22.10% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 19.53% for the next five year.

This is why she often refers to herself as “eternally 12,” a way of simultaneously acknowledging her tragic youth and the childhood she never had. This caused the singer to adapt to tense situations, burying many of her own emotions for the sake of those around her and employing humor as a way to deflect while leaning heavily on songwriting and performing to bring her solace. This pattern continued throughout her life, including her marriage to Mottola, who, as she recounts in the book, was also controlling and abusive. “Captivity and control come in many forms, but the goal is always the same — to break down the captive’s will, to kill any notion of self-worth and erase the person’s memory of their own soul,” she wrote of Mottola’s viselike grip on her life.
 Interestingly, the memoir fails to touch on several major moments in Carey’s career, though some are addressed subtly and shadily. For example, though she doesn’t call out Jennifer Lopez explicitly in the memoir, she alludes very clearly to the star, whom she is still definitely not very fond of. During the creation of the _Glitter_ soundtrack, Carey, now divorced from Mottola, says her old label wanted to sabotage her. Upon finding out she sampled “Firecracker” by Yellow Magic Orchestra for the song “Loverboy,” “Sony rushed to make a single for another female entertainer on the label (whom I don’t know).” As if that dig weren’t clear enough, she hammers her disdain for Lopez even further. Later in the book, Carey recounts how exhausted she was during that particular era, a result of being pushed to her limit by Virgin Records. “Loverboy” was reworked with Cameo’s “Candy” and “ended up being the best- selling single of 2001 in the United States. _I’m_ real.”
 In addition to her commitment to _not_ acknowledging Lopez’s existence, Carey also makes no mention of Stella Bulochnikov, her former manager. Last year the singer settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought against Carey by Bulochniko, although Carey denied the charges. Shockingly, there is also no mention of Eminem, whom the star famously parodied and seemed to characterize as an obsessed stalker in her 2009 video “Obsessed,” which wasn’t the first song purported to be about him. There’s also “Clown” on 2002’s _Charmbracelet_ album, which features the lyrics, “You should've never intimated we were lovers / When you know very well we never even touched each other.” (Though there have been reports of an alleged fling between Carey and Eminem, she has repeatedly denied them.) With his omission from her memoir, it seems she’s decided to rewrite history and act as though he doesn’t exist at all. That’s also the same treatment given to James Packer, the Australian billionaire she was engaged to for a short time before splitting in 2016, reportedly requesting $50 million from him as an “inconvenience fee.” _The Meaning of Mariah_ , in a way, serves as a reintroduction of the superstar, and none of these people, it seems, made enough of an impact on her life to be mentioned explicitly, in the most intimate look at her life to date. Carey can do whatever she wants in _her_ book, she seems to say, even create her own reality.
 Fortunately, one thing that endures in both Carey’s reality and the one everyone else inhabits is her music. Her new album, _The Rarities,_ out today, is a compilation of several unreleased songs, including beloved b-side tracks like “Slipping Away,” as well as the original version of “Loverboy,” and live performances from the singer’s 1996 Daydream World Tour at Japan’s Tokyo Dome. The tracks span the length of Carey’s career, from the early ’90s until 2020.
 In recent years, Carey has endured some not-so-great press about her live performances, like the 2016 New Year’s Eve Times Square performance where she couldn’t sing her song “Emotions,”because of technical difficulties. Carey said she couldn’t hear due to problems with her earpiece — her team apparently hadn’t done a soundcheck — and commenced awkwardly walking around the stage, attempting to be cheeky to offset the mortifying incident taking place. When she was pilloried by the press in the aftermath and responded on Twitter, saying, “Shit happens … Here’s to making more headlines in 2017.” Carey addresses the failed performance in her memoir with more candor. “To me, it’s if I was a child playing the sandbox and I got sand in my eye, wept theatrically, and caused a scene—then arrived twenty years later at my class reunion, after having gotten a PhD and become a celebrated scholar only to have my classmates ask, ‘Oh, but how’s your eye?’” she said. It may have been a horror to witness for onlookers, but Carey doesn’t seem too concerned — as she emphasizes in her memoir, she has persevered and overcome much more challenging obstacles throughout her career. “All debacles are not created equal, dahhhhling,” she writes.
 Her memoir reveals the grueling and isolating work that went into becoming a global superstar. Carey was always more than a record-breaking hitmaker, a diva who crashed _TRL_ (which she reveals she did as a way of promoting the “Loverboy” single, as her new label was being slack), and yes, much more than her melismatic, goosebump-inducing voice. The memoir does an excellent job of illustrating that Carey is — gasp — a human being whose humble beginnings will likely resonate with anyone who has ever dreamed about using their talent to rise above their circumstances. ●

 “My whole family had it,” John Paul responded. “My mom died from it. You are misunderstanding the data from the CDC. There are nearly 200,000 deaths from COVID, and nobody knows who it will affect until it does. It isn’t a hoax. I would be careful about what you say.”
 “[Look] bro I’ve been praying for u and ur family,” the friend responded. “I had it too. But at the end of the day the survival rate is 99%. U don’t shut a country down for that.”

A cricketer, competing in the Indian Premier League in the UAE, has "reported a corrupt approach", putting BCCI's anti-corruption unit (ACU) on a high alert. The 13th edition of the IPL in being held in the UAE in a bio-secure environment, which has significantly reduced the chance for persons with dubious credentials approaching the player directly. The threat though still remains by and large due to the online network of corruptors.
 BCCI ACU chief Ajit Singh confirmed the development to PTI. "Yes (a player has reported aproach)," Singh, the former DGP of Rajasthan Police confirmed the news. "We are tracking him. It will take some time," he said when asked if the alleged corruptor or "person of Interest" has been nabbed.
 As per anti-corruption protocols, the name of the player (Indian or overseas) or franchise is not revealed for confidentiality purposes. With players and support staff staying in a bio-bubble, unlike other years, the ACU is concentrating more on the possible online corrupt approaches.
 Most of the players, especially the younger ones are mostly on social media platforms like instagram and twitter where unknown people masquerading as fans try to befriend them. A senior BCCI official said all the players whether overseas or Indian international, uncapped domestic players have all attended multiple anti-corruption classes.
   
   
 "The best part is that the player who was approached immediately sensed that something is fishy. He had suspicion and he immediately shared his concerns with the ACU. Every player, even those who have come from the U-19s are well aware about each and every anti-corruption protocols," the BCCI official, privy to the development, told PTI on the condition of anonymity.
 Due to health safety protocols this year, the ACU had organised its mandatory counselling sessions virtually for all the eight teams. Singh is leading a eight-man team in the UAE.
 The BCCI has tied up with UK-based company Sportradar, which will offer its "integrity services" to prevent betting and other corrupt practices during the upcoming IPL through its Fraud Detection Services (FDS).

The word “karma” was being bandied about on social media not so much in a spirit of schadenfreude as in relief that a traditional storytelling arc was at long last asserting itself. The bad guy has a habit of stealing the show, but if there’s no comeuppance, if the transgressor continues to get away with murder, exhaustion is inevitable. Reckonings can be postponed but only for so long.
 But how could anyone be sure that we’re in the last act of a single play and not in a multipart epic? Or might this be a tragicomedy à la Chekhov, where a gun glimpsed early on is eventually used to settle a score but doesn’t actually hit its target? In this scenario, Trump, who expresses derision for public health safety measure like masks, is infected with the virus but only gets mildly ill and then uses his bully pulpit to espouse the notion that the pandemic has been a Democratic hoax designed to unseat him.
 Nothing changes because we’re in a genre that is comfortable ending on a note of mournful irony. Yet political entities with nuclear arsenals at their disposal aren’t usually characters in Chekhovian plots. Their lives are too consequential. Best to leave the existential musing to those with nothing to do all day but ruminate on missed chances.

Our office is currently working remotely,” a spokesperson for Stauber’s office said in an email to BuzzFeed News Friday.
 Before he announced his negative result Friday, Hagedorn's office said he would continue his normal duties.
 “Because Congressman Hagedorn’s interactions with the president and others who tested positive did not meet the criteria of close contact — within a distance of six feet for a duration of more than 15 minutes — [Attending Physician of the US Congress] Dr. Monahan advised the congressman to continue his official duties, such as voting on the House floor, wear a mask, and delay air travel until the results of his COVID-19 test are confirmed as ‘negative,’” the statement from Hagedorn’s office said.
 None of the three members responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment on what interactions the Minnesota Republicans had with other members of Congress while voting at the Capitol on Thursday.
 Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said on _Fox & Friends_ on Friday morning that he would also be tested after traveling with Trump to Tuesday’s debate. Jordan said in the interview that he was not concerned about having caught the virus and that he was only with the president for “a brief, brief amount of time.”
 More than a dozen members of Congress have tested positive for the virus, and several dozens of others have self-quarantined in recent months due to exposure to the virus. Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah were the first to test positive in early March, and 15 other members of Congress have tested or been presumed positive since then, according to NPR.
 While many congressional hearings have been held remotely or partially remotely, the House and Senate have continued to meet in person despite the pandemic, and members have continued frequent travel to and from Washington, DC. Many Republicans on the Hill have refused to wear masks.
 Pelosi instituted a mask mandate in July, after Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, who refused to wear a mask while on the Hill, tested positive.
 There is no standardized COVID-19 testing at the Capitol.

On Wednesday, Proekt, an independent Russian investigative outlet, reported more details about the lengths to which the Kremlin has gone to keep Putin safe. Meetings with the Russian leader have been severely limited; anyone who does meet him must first endure a strict two-week quarantine at a health center with regular checkups, pass a COVID-19 test, and then finally pass through the “disinfection tunnel,” Proekt said, citing sources close to the Kremlin. Even then, meetings are conducted with social distancing in place.
 Sightings of Putin anywhere other than through a screen and sitting at his desk have been extremely rare since the start of the pandemic. One notable sighting came in June when he appeared front and center at a military parade to mark the anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Putin was seated in a crowd that included elderly veterans of the war; the government had put them up in a health resort for 14 days beforehand.
 Trump, meanwhile, has continued to travel across the nation for campaign events, including events in Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and New Jersey this week, as well his first presidential debate against former vice president Joe Biden, which featured an audience in Ohio on Tuesday. Along with him, he has brought members of Congress and White House staffers onto Air Force One.
 Unlike the White House press pool, which has limited the number of reporters who attend the president’s briefings but continued to function, Kremlin pool reporters who saw Putin on an almost daily basis before the pandemic have not seen him in months. The only images of the Russian leader on Twitter and Telegram accounts operated by pool reporters for the state-run news agency RIA Novosti are those in which he appears from his residence.
 “The work of the president is practically not covered by journalists. Except for a personal cameraman, a photographer from the state TASS [news agency] and a VGTRK film crew, no one is allowed to attend events. And all the journalists in the Kremlin pool write their reports while watching the [president’s] broadcasts on the Russia-24 channel,” Proekt wrote.
 Putin, who is often pictured in Kremlin photo ops working out, riding shirtless on horseback through the Russian mountains, and swimming in the Black Sea, appears to be in good health. But at almost 68 — his birthday is Oct. 7 — he is about three years past the average life expectancy of a Russian man. With no succession plan apparently in place — and having just changed the constitution for him to be able to rule until 2036 — Russia would likely descend into chaos if the president got sick and died.
 And the coronavirus has on several occasions managed to infiltrate Putin’s administration and the Russian government. Peskov contracted it in May and was hospitalized. And since spring, at least three Russian ministers have tested positive for it, including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova, and Minister of Housing Vladimir Yakushev. The head doctor of a leading Moscow hospital who also fell ill with the virus shortly after he appeared in a photo op with Putin during a March visit.
 If Trump has taken cues or echoed Putin in the past, it does not seem like he will when it comes to personal precautions related to the coronavirus.
 With just 32 days before the presidential election, the White House physician said Friday that Trump will “continue carrying out his duties without disruption.”
 In relative isolation and from the comfort and safety of his residence outside Moscow, Putin wished him the best.
 “I am sure that your inherent vitality, vigor and optimism will help you overcome the dangerous virus,” the Russian president wrote in his telegram.

El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ha hecho saber que el tratamiento por coronavirus al que se está sometiendo en el hospital Walter Reed parece estar surtiendo efecto y ha agradecido al pueblo estadounidense su preocupación por su estado de salud, en su primer mensaje tras su ingreso a última hora de este viernes.
 "¡Voy bien, creo! ¡Gracias a todos! ¡Amor!", ha escrito Trump en su cuenta de Twitter, poco después de empezar su tratamiento con el antiviral remdesivir frente al coronavirus, aunque no necesita suministro adicional de oxígeno, según ha anunciado en un comunicado el médico del mandatario, Sean P. Conley.
 "No necesita ningún suplemento de oxígeno, pero tras consultar a los especialistas, hemos elegido iniciar el tratamiento con remdesivir. Ha completado su primera dosis y está descansando cómodamente", ha transmitido el médico de Trump.
 Además, un alto cargo ha confirmado a CNN que el director de la campaña electoral del mandatario, Bill Stepien, ha dado positivo en coronavirus, aunque ha asegurado que seguirá trabajando desde casa. Asimismo, Kellyanne Conway, quien fuera una de las principales asesoras de Trump, y todavía integrante de su estrecho círculo de aliados, también ha dado positivo.
 Los contagios siguen aumentando en la clase política estadounidense. El último en confirmar su caso ha sido el senador por Carolina del Norte Thom Tillis, miembro del Comité Judicial, al que se suma el positivo del senador por Utah Mike Lee. Los dos senadores republicanos estuvieron junto a Trump el sábado pasado en la ceremonia de nominación de la jueza Amy Coney Barrett para el Tribunal Supremo.
 Ante el contagio de Trump, el presidente puede ceder temporalmente el mando del país a su 'número dos' en caso de estar incapacitado para seguir ejerciendo las funciones.
 Desde la Casa Blanca, han asegurado que la salud del vicepresidente de Estados Unidos, Mike Pence, es buena y han querido disipar cualquier duda sobre una posible transmisión de poder: "El presidente sigue en el cargo".
 Pence seguirá con sus actos de campaña y se enfrentará el próximo miércoles a un debate con la candidata demócrata a la Vicepresidencia, Kamala Harris. Sin embargo, habrá cambios en el formato del mismo, ya que se ampliará la distancia entre los aspirantes --12 pies (3,7 metros)-- tras los últimos acontecimientos.
 En un principio, estaba estimado que la distancia entre los candidatos fuera solo de siete metros (2,1 metros), algo que criticaron desde la campaña demócrata, según fuentes de la cadena CNN.
 Trump ha sido trasladado esta tarde en helicóptero al hospital y presenta fiebre desde esta mañana. Tanto él como la primera dama, Melania Trump, había anunciado horas antes que habían dado positivo por coronavirus después de que una de sus asistentes más cercanas, Hope Hicks, también contrajera Covid-19.
 Uno de los médicos de la Casa Blanca ha señalado, además, que el presidente se encuentra "fatigado", si bien la secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Kayleigh McEnany, ha asegurado que presenta "síntomas leves" y está "animado".
 El mandatario anunció en mayo que las autoridades sanitarias norteamericanas habían aprobado el uso del medicamento antiviral remdesivir para tratar a pacientes de COVID-19.
 La Agencia de Medicamentos y Alimentos de Estados Unidos (FDA) aprobó el uso de emergencia de este tratamiento experimental, después de que algunos pacientes tratados con remdesivir tuvieran una recuperación más rápida tras contagiarse con el coronavirus.

A cricketer, competing in the Indian Premier League in the UAE, has "reported a corrupt approach", putting BCCI's anti-corruption unit (ACU) on a high alert. The 13th edition of the IPL in being held in the UAE in a bio-secure environment, which has significantly reduced the chance for persons with dubious credentials approaching the player directly. The threat though still remains by and large due to the online network of corruptors.BCCI ACU chief Ajit Singh confirmed the development to PTI. "Yes (a player has reported aproach)," Singh, the former DGP of Rajasthan Police confirmed the news. "We are tracking him. It will take some time," he said when asked if the alleged corruptor or "person of Interest" has been nabbed.As per anti-corruption protocols, the name of the player (Indian or overseas) or franchise is not revealed for confidentiality purposes. With players and support staff staying in a bio-bubble, unlike other years, the ACU is concentrating more on the possible online corrupt approaches.Most of the players, especially the younger ones are mostly on social media platforms like instagram and twitter where unknown people masquerading as fans try to befriend them. A senior BCCI official said all the players whether overseas or Indian international, uncapped domestic players have all attended multiple anti-corruption classes."The best part is that the player who was approached immediately sensed that something is fishy. He had suspicion and he immediately shared his concerns with the ACU. Every player, even those who have come from the U-19s are well aware about each and every anti-corruption protocols," the BCCI official, privy to the development, told PTI on the condition of anonymity.Due to health safety protocols this year, the ACU had organised its mandatory counselling sessions virtually for all the eight teams. Singh is leading a eight-man team in the UAE. The BCCI has tied up with UK-based company Sportradar, which will offer its "integrity services" to prevent betting and other corrupt practices during the upcoming IPL through its Fraud Detection Services (FDS).

 I’ve tried so hard to accept the new curves and bumps and stretch marks that have come just from living life. I have tried to come to terms with needing a bigger bra and the next size up in pants. I tried to look at others who identified as fat, especially the ones who seemed to love their bodies, hoping somehow their confidence would rub off on me through my phone screen. There’s a whole slew of #bodypositivity influencers who post amazing photos of themselves partially nude, celebrating their big and self-proclaimed weird and imperfect bodies with back rolls and belly fat.

If ever there was a time to rethink the role of women in the workforce, it is now. While there are several efforts being made to facilitate the growth of women entrepreneurs, encourage more women to enter the health care sector and even IT sector, perhaps an area which has been neglected and sorely needs attention is manufacturing and heavy industries. According to studies, women barely constitute 12% in the manufacturing sector, just 3% in core engineering. This is in contrast to the IT sector which attracts much greater women's participation, thanks to a variety of reasons.The IT sector offers jobs with relatively high remuneration and perks, it is knowledge-based and so more gender-neutral, the work flow is flexible and the work is not considered physically strenuous. The number of women in the IT sector had been increasing incrementally till Covid-19 struck after which we don't have any authentic information. Many IT companies saw diversity and inclusion as desirable and believed that these principles enhanced productivity. Companies such as Wipro and Infosys have built in equal opportunities and facilitate talent growth among women employees. These have proved beneficial to the business. But we need to look beyond just these avenues as we head towards an economic situation where generating employment across sectors will make all the difference. There are several reasons why women are under-represented in the manufacturing and heavy industries sector. The obvious ones are that these are perceived to require hard manual labour, not a correct assumption always; that the hours are long and are not as lucrative as other professions. Another more compelling reason is that women are not encouraged to acquire the skills to go into this sector. This is where the fillip that the New Education Policy plans to give to vocational training could help. In countries such as Germany, vocational education is seen as attractive and a route to employment, whereas, in India, it is looked down upon, something that a person who could not get into a conventional degree course would opt for. The government must make more women aware of job opportunities in this sector and emphasise that most companies engaged in manufacturing and heavy industries, by and large, do not compromise on the safety and health of their employees. Women bring collaboration, innovation and creative thinking to the workplace. Employers must at least now take note of global practices where principles such as parental leave and flexible hours are incorporated into workplace functioning. The idea should be to make maximum use of the human resources that we have and make a shift to more gender inclusion across fields. Where women have been given the opportunity and conducive conditions, they have excelled. I was pleasantly surprised recently to read a while ago that the mining giant, Vedanta's central control room at its aluminium plant in Lanjigarh is operated entirely by a team of women. They focus on operations and optimising resources, not easy work in a business seen largely as a man's profession. I am sure that there are many more such examples. We need to showcase these and highlight the experiences of women in these fields. The way India and its women will move into a post-Covid-19 world will be key to social and economic empowerment. lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal

“With the makeup of our audience, we’ve found out that we need to be able to provide more seating for people that need no-step or few-step options in the theaters,” Howard said, “and also to provide more efficient and better ways for getting people in and out of the theater.”
 In the Foellinger Great Hall, a ramp has been added so that disabled patrons can enter the foyer from Level Four. Restrooms in the theater’s foyer were also made to be accessible, and the carpet was replaced to a thinner material to make it easier to push a wheelchair on the surface.
 In the upper parking deck, where patrons had to traverse the same ramps as cars to get into the building, defined paths for pedestrians have been carved out. Accessible seats were added to Tryon Festival Theatre, and the same will be done to Colwell Playhouse.
 At a university known for its accessibility, the renovation was a much-needed update.
 “Krannert Center values inclusivity, and we want to make sure we are a place that’s welcome to people with a wide range of abilities,” Howard said. “We want everyone to feel welcome here. We want everyone to be able to participate in our programs, and so any time we get the chance to be able to add amenities or make changes or increase the accessibility, it’s really at the top of our list.”

Carol Elaine Trimble Kieschnick 1946 - 2020Houston, TX—Carol Elaine Trimble Kieschnick knew who she was and what she wanted – to be a wife and mother. From her family's perspective, Elaine was the best on the face of the Earth at both. Born on May 4, 1946 in East St. Louis and raised in Taylorville, Illinois, Elaine (as she was known by her family and friends) meticulously created cut-out paper dolls of a husband, wife and children when she was a young girl with dreams of making a family of her own one day. Elaine later often said that, as hard as she tried to cut those paper dolls perfectly, she never imagined that she could build a family as special as her actual tight-knit bunch which consisted of her husband, Rev. John H. Kieschnick, and her children, Jonathan, Kimberly and Jason.There was nobody (and never will be anybody) quite like Elaine. Married to John in Springfield, Illinois on July 4, 1970, Elaine pursued her ambition of constructing a family and raising kids in Irving, Texas where John pastored at his first church and in the Clear Lake area beginning in 1974 where the family moved when John accepted a call to pastor at Gloria Dei Lutheran Church. As a wife, Elaine was a stable, solid foundational rock on whom John could securely rely to hold down the fort as John excelled in his ministry. Elaine was a far cry from the stereotypical pastor's wife (as silent submission was not her thing). Elaine liked to shake things up a bit with her borderline-devilish sense of humor and her frequently vocalized opinions concerning virtually all topics except for politics or sports about which she did not care a lick. As a mother, Elaine was a trailblazer and a fierce protector. Elaine brilliantly employed unorthodox parenting methods (e.g., in quelling a fight between Jonathan and Kimberly, Elaine once required that the combatants sit down on the couch right next to one another, hold hands and exchange compliments until laughter at the creative "compliments" replaced the anger giving rise to the conflict). Elaine confounded speech therapists with a special language and novel pronunciations that Elaine used to communicate with Jason. Elaine had no reservations about utilizing corporal punishment. However, at the root of any of Elaine's disciplinary measures was love and devotion. Up to the moment of Elaine's death, Elaine gave anything and everything that she had to her family.After leading her kids through their formative years, Elaine embarked on a long career in the Clear Creek Independent School District primarily as a Principal's administrative assistant. Elaine extended and commanded respect in that capacity. She exuded motherly love (and some old-fashioned discipline as necessary) to the students. Elaine also formed deep and long-lasting bonds with her co-workers who Elaine adored and to whom Elaine dispensed advice and opinions about love, life, morality and relationships often bewildering those within earshot as to how Elaine could get away with vocalizing such strong sentiments without causing a scene or jeopardizing the friendship.Elaine's physical life on this Earth came to a close on September 21, 2020 surrounded by her family in her League City home. Elaine was preceded in death by her dear father, Roscoe Carroll Trimble, and her extraordinary mother, Lorraine Gilmartin Trimble. In addition to her husband and children, Elaine is survived by daughter-in-law, Olga Vladimirovna Kieschnick, of whom Elaine was so proud, by her sister and brother-in-law, Marilyn and Jim Rigney, who Elaine loved and admired, by her niece, Christine Rigney, who Elaine treated as Elaine's own baby when Christine was born and who Elaine always loved like a daughter, as well as scores of Kieschnickin-laws, out-laws, nieces and nephews who lovingly embraced Elaine from the day that John brought Elaine to Texas. In lieu of flowers or other gifts, it was Elaine's wish that contributions be made to the Endowment Funds at Gloria Dei Lutheran Church in Nassau Bay, Trinity Lutheran Church in downtown Houston or South Lake Church in League City. A private, family celebration of Elaine's life is scheduled.As the end of Elaine's life neared, Elaine was inundated with cards, messages, Facebook posts and calls from incredibly compassionate people who were a huge part of why Elaine loved her life so much. One common theme expressed in those kind sentiments was that many people felt that Elaine was her/his "best friend" or that Elaine loved her/him the "most." This was among Elaine's great legacies – making people feel that they were the best or loved the most. In these divisive times, we should live as Elaine did in order to serve as a reminder that being loved abundantly and to the max is available to all – no matter race, gender, orientation, political party or nationality – by and through Jesus Christ with whom Elaine now peacefully and painlessly resides in Heaven.

New Delhi [India], October 3 (ANI): Army Chief General MM Naravane and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla are scheduled to visit Myanmar on October 4-5 during which the two sides will take stock of the existing bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in areas of mutual interest.   During their visit, the delegation will call on the State Counsellor of Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.   "Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, few direct exchanges have taken place between the two sides. This visit will provide an opportunity to take stock of the existing bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in areas of mutual interest," a Ministry of External Affairs release said.   India attaches high priority to its relationship with Myanmar in accordance with its 'Neighborhood First' and 'Act East' policies.   In recent times, both sides have strengthened their cooperation in several areas, including connectivity and trade, development projects, energy, capacity building, defence and security and culture and people-to-people links.   In May 2012, an MoU was signed on India-Myanmar Border Area Development. The MoU provides for USD 5 million each year over a period of 5 years. This MoU has been extended till 2022.  
 The programme, which is in an advanced stage, has seen the successful implementation of around 140 projects such as roads and bridges, health care centres, schools, and other such infrastructure projects. In August 2020, the Ambassador of India to Myanmar handed over a cheque of USD 5 million to Lt-Gen Ye Aung. India is also extending socio-economic development assistance for projects pertaining to health, education, agriculture, and allied activities to Rakhine State through a grant-in-aid of USD 5 million per annum.   India has invested in a host of connectivity projects in Myanmar, such as the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project and Trilateral Highway connecting India, Myanmar and Thailand.   With investments of over USD1.2 billion, Myanmar has the highest Indian investment in any country in South Asia. Recently India approved an investment of over USD 120 million in the Shwe Oil and Gas project.   Myanmar has recently ratified the amendment to the Framework Agreement of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) which would enable the expansion of the scope of ISA membership to all member states of the United Nations.   The conservation work of Ananda Temple was started by the Archaeological Survey of India in the month of May 2012 before the visit of Prime Minister of India to Myanmar.   The MoU between India and Myanmar for the Conservation of Earthquake Damages Pagodas in Bagan was signed on 11 May 2018. The effective working season at Bagan is from around October to May every year as for the rest of months the weather is very extreme due to which it is difficult to carry on with the conservation operations.

Friday, Daley found more dead cows, a half dozen that had sought false safety near a creek. He collected their trapezoidal bells, as he has done each time he finds a carcass. Some of the bells go back generations, the biggest ones reserved for special “ladies,” as Daley calls them, the old-hand cows who knew their way around this range after years of wandering.
 But he hasn’t found living cows in days, and the only sound in the forest was the hollow knock of metal on metal from the bells he held.
 The time to end the search was nearing, the scope of the ruin settling in so that he sometimes wakes at night, mad at himself — for sticking with this unsparing endeavor, for passing it on to his kids. But in daylight, it’s clear this is the only place for the Daleys.
 Here is where Dave’s grandmother taught in a one-room schoolhouse down the road. Here is where he bumped along in the back of his grandfather’s pickup on cold fall mornings, hot chocolate his reward for taking part in the roundup. Here is where his children played in spring-fed meadows, when the grass was an electric yellow-green and the calves still stood on wobbly legs.
 “This is a hard country to know,” he said. “Thirty years from now, Juni will be riding down a trail and probably find a bell.”
