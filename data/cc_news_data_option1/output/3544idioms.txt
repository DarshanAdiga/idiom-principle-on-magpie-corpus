SPRINGFIELD -- A fall campaign season in which ethics was going to be one of the campaign issues took a new turn last week with the move by House Republicans to form a committee to look into House Speaker Michael Madigan's dealings with Commonwealth Edison.
   
 Madigan called the move a "political stunt" and issued a lengthy, strongly worded statement highly critical of House Republican Leader Jim Durkin.
   
 At the same time a special committee will be investigating Madigan, lawmakers expect to hold hearings on a long-awaited package of ethics reform measures that lawmakers from both parties have been demanding since three legislators in quick succession faced federal charges for a variety of alleged wrongdoing. A fourth lawmaker has since been charged.
   
 House Majority Leader Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago, said last week the plan does not have ethics-reform proposals discussed this summer with the idea that the General Assembly could vote on them during the veto session. Harris is co- chair of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform.
   
 Harris said he doesn't think the activities of the Special Investigating Committee looking into Madigan will have any effect on the ethics reform proposals. Although the commission hasn't met in months, Harris said it had already accumulated testimony from various interest groups that will be used to help formulate ethics recommendations.
   
 He also doesn't expect any potential partisan rancor over the Madigan investigation to carry over to the commission's work.
   
 "On the ethics commission, the Republican members, the Democrat members, the public members, we've all worked very well together and very collaboratively," he said. "Obviously, there will be potentially some differences on what the end product should be, but I don't think the other activities will impact our working together."
   
 Just how the committee investigating Madigan will work is being developed. Committee Chair Rep. Emanuel "Chris" Welch, D-Hillside, said he hopes to have an organizational meeting of the committee this week. He said he's not sure how many times the committee may meet or how long the process will take.
   
 "Number one, our guiding post has to be that Speaker Madigan, just like any other member of the House, is entitled to due process and a fair process," he said. "What that looks like we don't know. We have to discuss this as a group."
   
 ComEd agreed to pay a $200 million fine after federal prosecutors charged the utility with one count of bribery. They said ComEd gave contracts and jobs to Madigan associates in an attempt to curry favor with the Speaker. The bribery count will be dropped in the future if ComEd continues to cooperate with prosecutors in their on-going investigation.
   
 Madigan has not been charged with anything and has denied any wrongdoing.
   
 Like Harris, Welch doesn't think the Madigan investigation will get entwined with the work of the ethics commission.
   
 "It is two separate committees. We are going to follow the House rules for this special committee," Welch said. "I believe those are two separate things."
   
 With the committee evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, it is unlikely the votes will materialize to take action against Madigan. Even if the committee were to recommend charges, the issue goes before another panel which decides if it should go to the full House. Finally, it would take a three fifths vote of the House to reprimand or censure Madigan and a two- thirds vote to expel him.
   
 Retired University of Illinois-Springfield political scientist Kent Redfield said he's not even sure what kind of case House Republicans will be able to make against Madigan. The U.S. Attorney's office has said it is continuing to investigate political corruption issues. When news of the investigating committee surfaced, Durkin said the U.S. Attorney's office was notified of it and that it will not interfere with the federal investigation.
   
 Based on that, Redfield said he's not sure where the House committee investigation is headed.
   
 "It's not clear to me what they are going to look at or who they're going to talk to," Redfield said. "The U.S Attorney doesn't want the ComEd people answering questions and going on the record on things that might come up in some kind of trial."
   
 He said it is doubtful that any potential targets of the feds will want to testify to state lawmakers about things federal investigators may be interested in. Moreover, a defense attorney wouldn't allow a client to put himself in jeopardy by testifying, he said.
   
 "I'm not sure what happens with this beyond a flurry of headlines before the election," he said. "If you could get the speaker in there to take the Fifth Amendment before the election that would not be good. But I don't know how they make that happen."
   
 Rep. Tim Butler, R-Springfield, said there are more than headlines to be had from the House investigation.
   
 "I wouldn't be surprised if there's ethics-related legislation that comes out of that," he said. "I certainly think the potential is there to have bi- partisan legislation (from the hearings)."
   
 At the same time, Democrats have to be careful about how they approach the issue, Redfield said. They can slow-walk the proceedings and have people complain about their tactics or they can bring people in and watch them plead the Fifth Amendment.
   
 "It does put the Democrats in a double-bind," said Redfield. "They're either going to look like they're obstructing things or the people under suspicion are going to have to refuse to cooperate."
   
 The offshoot of it all may be to motivate Democrats to an even greater degree to get behind meaningful ethics legislation. Redfield said it would be an important step toward rehabilitating the party's image in the wake of four Democratic lawmakers facing federal criminal charges in a little over a year and the cloud now hanging over Madigan.
   
 Whether it gets done during the veto session is unclear given the push by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus to pass comprehensive legislation promoting racial equality and criminal justice reform. But Redfield also said it could be an effective first act for the General Assembly that is seated in January.

BLOOMFIELD, Mo. (KFVS) - Combat veteran Blair Moran is voicing his opinion on the ongoing fight to keep the military independent paper known as “Stars and Stripes.”“We think secretary of Defense Esper is being very cold and callous,” he said.Those comments came earlier today, before President Trump sent a tweet out saying funding won’t be cut “under his watch.” President Trump came under fire from veterans and congressional leader from both parties. The Pentagon was planning to shut the publication down effective the end of September.“It only represents 15 million dollars of the defense budget,” Moran said,The paper dates back to 1861, and It’s been a way to keep soldiers updated while on active duty in isolated areas.He said, ”coming off of combat operations in Vietnam and Cambodia that’s all we had to look forward to.”“Stars and Stripes” has roots in the Heartland. Laura Dumey is the administrator at the national stars and stripes museum in Bloomfield, Missouri.“It’s important to us here because this is where it all started. And we have dedicated our whole museum to the Stars and Stripes,” she said.She stated that without the paper it’s difficult for soldiers to tell their stories or get news. “It would be almost like it stopped where it is, and obviously, we know our conflicts aren’t going to stop oversees I don’t know what will happen,” she said.Dumey and Moran said they will continue to fight to keep the paper.“We have a petition on our website to save the stars and stripes,” Dumey said.“I hope there is bipartisan efforts in the house and senate along with trump administration to get resolved,” Moran said.Copyright 2020 KFVS.

Sometimes Gordon can struggle to stay engaged with Harden and Westbrook as the two lead ball-handlers, but when they get him involved early and defenses allow him to get in rhythm, this becomes a nearly impossible offense to stop. Knowing who to help off of and who not to is the greatest test of defensive discipline in the modern NBA, because the best players in the world command help on the ball. Houston's entire offense is predicated on making defenses struggle with that decision.

Khris Middleton starred as the Milwaukee Bucks, their backs against the wall and star Giannis Antetokounmpo injured, beat the Miami Heat 118-115 in overtime on Sunday to stay alive in the NBA playoffs.
 With reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Antetokounmpo ruled out after aggravating his sprained right ankle in the first half, Middleton stepped up to score 36 points -- including nine of the Bucks' 11 in overtime.
 A Middleton three-pointer put Milwaukee up 116-112 with 6.9 seconds left in the extra session. Miami rookie Tyler Herro drained a three-pointer to close the gap to 116-115 before Middleton made two free throws to seal the win.
 Middleton led six Bucks players to score in double figures in the must-win game.
 Milwaukee, the Eastern Conference top seeds after posting the league's best regular-season record, trimmed the deficit in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semi-final to 3-1.
 They still have a mountain to climb as they try to become the first NBA team to rally from an 0-3 deficit to win a series.
 Antetokounmpo had rolled his right ankle in the Bucks' game-three defeat and twisted it again and went down hard in the second quarter.
 He stayed in the game and shot two free throws, making one, before limping to the locker room, clearly emotional as he was assisted by team personnel.
 The Bucks, leading 50-48 at halftime, announced that he would not return to the game.
 It was a huge blow for the Bucks. Antetokounmpo has already been named the league's defensive player of the year and is a heavy favorite to scoop a second straight MVP award after averaging 29.5 points per game, 13.6 rebounds and 56 assists.
 But Middleton came through in his absence, scoring 21 points in the third quarter to send the Bucks into the final frame trailing by three.
 Middleton was 0-for-6 in the fourth, but Brook Lopez poured in 10 for the Bucks and after Herro put the Heat up 107-106 with a three-pointer Milwaukee's Donte DiVicenzo drained one of two free throws to force overtime.

Listening? There’s at least some of the usual sound.
 Feeling? Close the eyes and it carries the same vibe.
 That’s enough to pass the litmus test of legitimacy, but something just doesn’t seem right.
 There are those times when a really good substitute will do, especially for adjusted standards.
 In this case, it was Friday’s start of high school football, West Virginia style.
 The Eastern Panhandle featured the only show in town, or at least in this general four-state area.
 Berkeley County’s Spring Mills headed about as far south as it could to face Washington of Jefferson County for its first game.
 The Cardinals and Patriots were two haves in the have-not world of fall high school sports during the pandemic we currently live in.
 Outside of three games on the edge of the Panhandle, all was quiet on the southern, eastern and northern fronts.
 Virginia and Maryland schools — outside of a few private schools — won’t have sports until 2021. Pennsylvania delayed its seasons until the end of the month, allowing each school system the flexibility to play or opt out of activities.
 For most schools, fall athletes are looking toward an abbreviated spring season.
 For West Virginia, it was time to charge forward — making a stand against COVID-19, which has taken down seasons faster than a blitzing linebacker — into a new, guarded form of normalcy.
 The product was there.
 It looked like football.
 It sounded like football.
 And it felt like football.
 It was a well-intended, highly-controlled imitation of the real thing.
 It did the trick.
 All attempts at normalcy were tainted with health precautions where possible.
 With that, the game had the feeling of the calm before a tornado touches down.
 The first new reality in the sensory test was driving to a traditional ceremonial rite of new school years — football’s opening night.
 Usually, first games carry as much commotion as a WalMart grand opening.
 But the drive, up Patriot Drive, was eerily quiet.
 There was no jockeying for good parking spots. No rush to the gate.
 It seemed more like entering a library than a football game.
 Once inside the stadium, the greeting was deafening. It was silence.
 The teams went through the pregame paces to get ready, but it seemed like it was to be for a silent auction, not football.

They are easy to spot because they spin their nest at the ends of the branches, said Michael Skvarla, an assistant research professor of arthropod identification at Penn State University.
 This marks the second year in a row that the unsightly nests have been plentiful. Some trees are covered with nests while others only have a few.
 One spot in central Pennsylvania where it’s easy to see them this year is along Interstate 83 near Lake Redman.
 Fall webworms follow a “boom and bust” cycle, Skvarla wrote in an email. They will increase in numbers for a few years, reach a peak, and crash when predator and parasitoid populations catch up with them.
 The predator and parasitoid populations crash when they don’t have any food left, which then allows the webworms to increase in population again.
 “So it may be that the webworms are just on the upswing of a normal cycle,” he said.
 The Yellow-billed Cuckoo is one that eats fall webworms, said Kelsey Frey, manager of education with York County Parks.
 “We have been hearing a lot of cuckoos this year (way more than usual),” she wrote in an email.

The blunt narratives by Nigeria’s Lai Mohammed and Ghana’s Endkojo Oppong- Nkrumah were obviously not the stock of diplomatic conversation. They rather symptomise cold war confrontation. Ideally at a time like this, it is Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama that should be leading the Nigerian narrative. Only that he himself apparently compounded misgivings with an alleged statement that the crackdown by Accra on foreign retail businesses in the country was for political gains. General elections are imminent in Ghana and sensitivity is high in that country’s partisan dynamics. This is why it helps that lawmakers in both countries have taken up the initiative to chart the path to peace. It is important, however, that whatever deals are struck in ongoing bilateral engagements are followed through for diligent and consistent implementation as would benefit ordinary citizens of both countries in the long run.

“He worked his tail off. He came to work every day. This was completely a football decision, had nothing to do with anything else,” Mayock said. “Quite frankly, I think the position change is a difficult one in any year, but it’s exaggerated in a COVID year with no offseason. So, you’re taking a kid who was a slot receiver in 2018, quarterback in 2019 and asking him to play running back in 2020. It was my call. He was not able to play today at the level expected. Because of that, we felt like we had to make a move. Again, it was 100% on me.”

The 2020 holiday season figures to be vastly different than seasons past. The novel coronavirus COVID-19 has transformed daily life in many ways. The public has become accustomed to wearing masks while shopping, limiting the number of people in public venues and keeping their distance from friends and loved ones. Many events have been reimagined as virtual celebrations because of social distancing protocols. For those with large families or people with inherent risk factors that make them more susceptible to illness, sharing the holidays over video conferencing apps may be the safest way to go in 2020.

"One of the things that's so cool about this is everyone is so happy," Thompson said.
 "We get all these comments on Facebook, or if I'm out in the field, everybody is like, 'Thanks for doing this,' (and) 'This is what I needed.' People are so happy to be out there and have a place to go."
 Word of their sunshine oasis has spread mostly through word of mouth as people come to enjoy a small break from reality. Thompson said that one woman came from Chicago to get away from the protests and gloom.
 In addition to sunflowers, Thompson also planted a field of zinnias, a field of wildflowers, and Mexican sunflowers that are known for attracting butterflies.
 Thompson said the response definitely means the sunflowers will be a regular thing at the farm, even without a pandemic.
 "I'm just glad we get to have a business people are happy to come to ... and get away from the city," Thompson said.

 The Wolfpack stood down on July 20 citing financial problems prompted by the pandemic. Unable to fund the team, majority owner David Argyle announced he was stepping away from the franchise which has not paid its players since June 10.
 Argyle has said he will make good on the missed payrolls when he is in a position to do so.
 Toronto met a Super League-imposed deadline last Tuesday to submit its reapplication paperwork. Super League tore up the Wolfpack's participation agreement after the club opted not to finish out the 2020 season, citing challenges caused by the pandemic.
 The Wolfpack started life in England's third-tier League 1 in 2017, winning their way first to the second-tier Championship and then Super League — where they were 0-6-0 when the pandemic halted play in March.
 Argyle has said the ownership group has poured $30 million into the Wolfpack since its inception.
 In the absence of Toronto, Super League is down to 11 teams — 10 from England and France's Catalan Dragons.
 The Wolfpack hope they can return to Super League in 2021 — and for the first time get their share of central distribution funding which includes a cut of the broadcast revenue from the league's Sky TV deal.
 While star players like Sonny Bill Williams (Sydney Roosters) and Ricky Leutele (Melbourne Storm) have signed loan deals with other clubs to finish out the 2020 season, McDermott says both are committed to the franchise if it returns to Super League.
 Bodene Thompson (Leeds) and Gareth O'Brien (Castleford) are also willing to return, according to McDermott.
 "The majority of the squad are staying strong," he told The Canadian Press. "I've talked to most of them the last few weeks. Clearly they're all concerned, clearly the whole squad is massively financially strained at the moment.

El exitazo de ‘Tigre y dragón’ (2000) provocó una avalancha de películas con chinos volando y pegando espadazos. Veinte años después, cuando el wuxia ha desaparecido prácticamente de las pantallas occidentales (entre ‘The Assassin’ y la segunda parte de ‘Tigre y dragón’ lo mataron), el realizador Hiro Murai (director de la serie ‘Atlanta’ y de muchos de los clips de Childish Gambino) hace una relectura del género de las artes marciales en clave metafórica y urbana. ‘sad day’ (tan “sad” que hasta a la “s” le cuesta estar en mayúscula) narra los conflictos sentimentales de una pareja en forma de combate alegórico. Un duelo de textura onírica y final con sablazo en la cara a lo ‘Equilibrium’ (2002), que describe una pelea de enamorados en tres escenarios: un bar-restaurante chino de estética muy influenciada por David Lynch (uno de los grandes maestros reconocidos por Murai junto a Takeshi Kitano), las calles de un Londres nocturno y desangelado (en sintonía con el clima emocional de la pareja), y el interior de un loft cuya decoración parece la proyección de una mente enajenada.

A survey of 2,000 public transport users by Transport Focus conducted last month suggested that 77% of train passengers were satisfied with the ability to keep a safe distance from others.
 The research also indicated that 50% were satisfied with the ease of finding out how busy a train service would be before travelling, and 69% were satisfied with the number of people wearing face coverings.
 It is mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport, apart for people with exemptions.
 A recent study by the Rail Safety and Standards Board concluded that the risk of contracting Covid-19 on an average journey is below 0.01%.
 LNER is adding 10 extra Anglo-Scottish services to its timetables from Monday, serving destinations such as Peterborough, Doncaster, York and Newcastle.
 The operator will continue to require passengers to reserve a seat in advance of travel to support social distancing on board.
 Managing director David Horne described LNER’s return to around 85% of its pre-Covid-19 timetable as “a significant step forward”.

“The leisure and hospitality sector, in particular, is facing the double- whammy of both the furlough support and Eat out to Help Out schemes ending.
 “The Government took bold action with its furlough policy which has undoubtedly saved many jobs and businesses.
 “However, the harsh reality is that these are unprecedented times and we would encourage the Government to introduce policies that will help UK business survive and ultimately compete internationally.
 “Other governments around the world are and will be introducing policies to protect their businesses.
 “We must not fall behind, particularly with Brexit looming.”
 In the Make report, almost one in four respondents disagreed with the Government’s decision to end the scheme, saying it should be extended to critical sectors.
 Make UK said an extension could help avoid a second wave of redundancies which the survey shows are in the pipeline.
 More than two-fifths of companies surveyed said they have already cut jobs, while almost a further third revealed they intend to in the next six months.
 The aerospace and automotive sectors are those most in need of an extension, said Make UK.

The leadoff batter reached against Richards each of the first three innings. Two of those scored.
 But after Matt Olson’s single took an odd bounce past Mitch Moreland at first base to bring Tommy LaStella home from second and tie the game 2-2 in the bottom of the third, Richards didn’t allow a baserunner until Sean Murphy’s two-out home run in the seventh made it 5-3.
 Richards’ nine strikeouts Sunday were his most since he struck out that many on June 2, 2018. A month and a half after that, he had Tommy John surgery and didn’t pitch again until last September.
 The Padres signed him to a two-year contract while he was early in the rehabilitation process with the idea they would get him for one season.
