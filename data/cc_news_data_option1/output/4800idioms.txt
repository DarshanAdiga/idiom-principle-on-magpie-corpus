MARSHALL COUNTY, Ky. (KFVS) - An Emergency Meeting of the Marshall County Fiscal Court was held Monday, to discuss the signing of an Emergency Executive Order by Judge Executive Kevin Neal.The order, which was supported by all county commissioners, will allow the Marshall County Fiscal Court to provide certain items of personal property to restaurants in the county to facilitate outdoor dining options. Tents will be made available in the next few days, and will be allocated to restaurants through the Emergency Management office.“During this time when so many of our local restaurants are struggling to remain in business due to these orders from the Governor, we have to come together, step up and help in any way we can. Some of these small businesses don’t have drive through capability or outdoor seating like the larger chain restaurants have. This is so much harder for them and their employees to overcome.”- Judge Executive Neal explained.Any restaurant in Marshall County who would like more information about obtaining a tent or other items, can contact the Marshall County Emergency Management office at (270) 527-4739.Copyright 2020 KFVS.

When making the application, the church had claimed that its congregation was growing and they wanted a more convenient place of worship than their current temporary location, which is understood to be at the West Bay Primary school. But according to the PAT's ruling, the representatives never provided any compelling reason why they should be given the green light given the relatively new and substantial SDA church very close by.

The National Christmas Tree Association said that, in normal years, “the selection of the White House Christmas tree is a media event at the NCTA Champion Grower’s farm attended by 100 or more people to observe the White House team select the perfect tree for the Blue Room.”
 It added that “2020 is far from a normal year — there was no selection event this year.”
 On Tuesday, the holiday events will continue at the White House as President Donald Trump participates in the annual pardoning of the National Thanksgiving Turkey at a ceremony in the Rose Garden.
 The turkeys – Corn and Cob – arrived Sunday at the luxury Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington and photographers were invited there Monday, as they are every year, to capture the fowl strutting around inside their hotel room.
 The first family has canceled its annual Thanksgiving week trip to Florida and will be gathering at the White House instead of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, where he is typically joined by hundreds of dues-paying members.
 President-Elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, has said that there will be only three people at his Thanksgiving table this year because of the virus
 “I got a big family you’ve probably heard a lot about. We do everything together,” he said during a virtual roundtable with health-care workers. This year, however, “There are going to be three of us because you can’t mix the families that have been away, that haven’t been quarantining.”
 Trump has remained largely behind closed doors since he lost his bid for reelection. He has refused to concede, lodging baseless allegations of voter fraud in an attempt to subvert the results.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government now plans to execute the first female inmate in almost six decades just days before President-elect Joe Biden, an opponent of the death penalty, takes office. Attorneys for Lisa Montgomery said Monday that the Justice Department rescheduled her execution for Jan. 12. Biden's inauguration comes Jan. 20. A federal judge in Washington had delayed the December execution of Montgomery, 49, because her lawyers tested positive for the novel coronavirus after visiting her behind bars. The delay was meant to allow her attorneys to recover from the virus and file a clemency petition on her behalf. Montgomery’s attorneys, Kelley Henry and Amy Harwell, said they both tested positive for COVID-19 after they flew from Nashville, Tennessee, to visit her at the federal prison in Texas where she is serving her sentence. In court papers, they said each roundtrip visit from Nashville involved two flights, hotel stays and interaction with airline and hotel staff, as well as prison employees. With the new execution date, Montgomery would be one of three federal inmates scheduled to die that week. Cory Johnson and Dustin Higgs are scheduled to be put to death on Jan. 14 and 15 while two other executions are scheduled for December. The Justice Department resumed federal executions this year after a 17-year hiatus. Eight people have been executed since July, more than during the previous half- century, despite waning public support from both Democrats and Republicans for its use. Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo has said the president-elect “opposes the death penalty now and in the future” and would work as president to end its use. But Ducklo did not say whether executions would be paused immediately once Biden takes office. Montgomery was convicted of...

Even if they win their next three games, after winning a few in a row, the Vikings would still have a lot of work to do to sneak in to the playoffs. They will need everything to break right, and not have any let downs. Even then, they may fall short. But, it is more fun to watch these games than the first handful of games.
