A new hospital that will be located in Williamsburg County is taking shape at least on paper. MUSC Health is currently designing a new hospital in the Williamsburg/Lake City region with a targeted opening date of January 2023. The facility is being built to replace two existing hospitals located in Kingstree and Lake City respectively and will become part of the Florence Division of MUSC Health.
 Williamsburg Regional Hospital was shut down after an October 2015, rain event that was considered the flood of the century. In December 2016, a temporary facility was opened next to the vacated building. It houses an emergency room and operating room among other departments and has filled a great need for the citizens.

In February 2019, MUSC Health signed a letter of intent with the two hospitals that authorizes MUSC to construct, own and operate a new $50 million replacement hospital. “Filing the certificate of need is a key step in moving forward with this new model for rural health care,” said Williamsburg Regional Hospital Board Chair Julie Floyd. “This demonstrates the level of commitment of all parties to move forward even though we are in the midst of a pandemic.”
 Williamsburg Regional Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troy Gamble has envisioned a new hospital since the 2015 flood. “I’m very excited to see plans on paper and steps moving forward to start breaking ground to complete our new hospital,” he said. The MUSC Health owned hospital will feature 25 licensed beds, full operating and diagnostic services, a 16-bay emergency department, and the latest capabilities in telehealth. The project represents MUSC’s ongoing effort to extend its mission to communities and citizens across the state.

Aaron Nelson Kaufman 47 of Nashville, passed away unexpectedly on July 10, 2020. Aaron was born Nov. 12, 1972 to David Kaufman and the late Roberta (Bobbi) Kaufman Hanna and grew up outside of Glenmont, Ohio. He was a devoted husband and best friend to his wife, Jessica. Aaron spent much of his childhood and teenage years hunting and bow fishing with his good friends, Shannon Smith, Eric Snow, Mike Bruce, Dave Colter, Kurt Miller and Adam Campbell. He was also considered the best big brother a little sister could ask for to Leah. When he wasn't enjoying the Holmes County countryside with his buddies, Aaron played and excelled at several sports including football and track, qualifying in 1990 for the state track meet in the 4X100 relay. Aaron graduated from West Holmes High School in 1991 and went on to Ashland University to earn a teaching degree in business and later his superintendent's license. After securing a first job as a study hall monitor at West Holmes High School, Aaron spent the last 27 years working his way to the top of the administrative ladder, most recently taking on the role as the West Holmes superintendent. Mr. Kaufman touched the lives of countless students while teaching business, coaching football, and serving as principal and athletic director for West Holmes High School. When Aaron took on the responsibility of helping to guide the youth of Holmes County, he squared his shoulders and became the man he was destined to be. He strove to be the best he could in all aspects of his life, and his patience, compassion, and fierce loyalty to the West Holmes School District will never be forgotten. Aaron's favorite pastime was being a dad and watching his children compete in football, basketball, soccer, wrestling, baseball and cheerleading. His children are thankful for his dedication to them, being a role model and pushing them to their full potential, and loving them with all his heart. Surviving are his children, of the home, Thane Kaufman, Tucker Kaufman, Tori Kaufman, and step son, Hunter King; wife, Jessica Kaufman; a sister, Leah (Dean) Schaffter of Millersburg; father, David Kaufman of Orrville; nephews, Philip Schaffter, Kirk (Kallie) Schaffter, Robert (Raelyn) Schaffter, and Troy Schaffter; grandmothers, Betty Kaufman of Wooster, and Carol Didinger of Glenmont and numerous aunts, uncles and cousins. Aaron was greeted in Heaven by his mother, Bobbi (Kaufman) Hanna and grandfathers, Robert Didinger and David Kaufman. A private, family service will be held. He will be laid to eternal rest at SS. Peter and Paul Catholic Church cemetery in Glenmont. Friends, colleagues, and current or former students who wish to help celebrate Mr. Kaufman's life are welcome to join the family at a celebration of life service, Sunday, July 19th at 7 p.m., that will be held at the West Holmes football stadium. In honor of Mr. Kaufman we will be following all social distancing guidelines. WKLM Radio FM 95.3 will broadcast the service live for those who are unable to attend. Guests are encouraged to wear West Holmes gear, gather together as one strong Knight Nation, and celebrate the legacy that Aaron leaves behind. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that memorial contributions be donated to the Aaron Kaufman Education Scholarship at the Holmes County Education Foundation. Those wishing to share a memory or make online condolences may do so by visiting www.alexanderfhinc.com.Alexander Funeral Home, 330-674-4811

“This competency issue is a very strong issue on paper,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “The Supreme Court has halted executions on this issue in the past. At a minimum, the question of whether Purkey dies is going to go down to the last minute.”
 Lee’s own execution went forward a day late. It was scheduled for 4 p.m. Monday, but the Supreme Court only gave the green light in a narrow 5-4 ruling early Tuesday.
 The issue of Purkey’s mental health arose in the runup to his 2003 trial and when, after the verdict, jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri. Prosecutors alleged that he raped and stabbed her, dismembered her with a chainsaw, burned her, then dumped her ashes 200 miles (320 kilometers) away in a septic pond in Kansas. Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old Mary Ruth Bales, of Kansas City, Kansas.
 But the legal questions of whether he was mentally fit to stand trial or to be sentenced to die are different from the question of whether he is mentally fit enough now, in the hours before his scheduled execution, to be put to death.
 Purkey’s lawyers argue he clearly is not, saying in recent filings that he suffers from advancing Alzheimer’s disease.
 “He has long accepted responsibility for the crime that put him on death row,” one of this lawyers, Rebecca Woodman, said. “But as his dementia has progressed, he no longer has a rational understanding of why the government plans to execute him.”
 Purkey believes his planned execution is part of a vast conspiracy involving his own attorneys, Woodman said. In other filings, they describe delusions that people were spraying poison into his room and that drug dealers implanted a device in his chest meant to kill him.
 While various legal issues in Purkey’s case have been hashed, rehashed and settled by courts over nearly two decades, the issue of mental fitness for execution can only be addressed once a date is set, according to Dunham, who also teaches law school courses on capital punishment. A date was only set last year.

I never made it all the way through Jerzy Kosinski's bleak and brooding 1965 novel "The Painted Bird." By the time I tried, it had won the National Book Award, and was being recommended to me by friends who read all of the "important" books of the day. I put it down - and never picked it up again - right after a scene in which a drunk old man attacked a younger man who he believed was staring at his wife, dug the victim's eyes out with a spoon, then tossed them on the floor.
 Yes, the scene is in the bleak and brooding, yet haunting and hypnotic, and gorgeously photographed black and white movie. But the appalling deed is staged in a manner that can be watched without revulsion, though we do get to see the eyeballs on the floor.
 No, this is not a psychological horror film in which a supernatural demon possesses people and makes them commit grisly acts. Rather, it's a psychological horror film about survival and resiliency in the midst of inconceivable and very real horror.
 Set in the latter stages of WWII in some unnamed Eastern European country, it presents the wrong place-wrong time somewhat picaresque story of a young boy (first-time actor Petr Kotlar) whose apparently once-normal life has been turned upside down. He's a wanderer on a devastated landscape, trying to "get home," wherever that may be and to whoever may be there.
 The film is cut up into chapters, each titled with a reference to a person or people that our innocent, sad, lonely protagonist - who looks to be about 8 years old - eventually meets up with. He hardly speaks (just a few words here and there), no one calls him by name (it's revealed near the end), and the reason that he's alone in the world isn't made clear (though that, too, is disclosed near the end).
 He's living in a small farmhouse with his stern Aunt Marta, doing chores, being assured that he'll "only be here for a while," and making wishful drawings of him with his parents. Marta wasn't kidding about his time there, as she dies shortly afterward, and he sets off down the road, his journey about to begin.
 The Czech director Vaclav Marhoul, who also adapted the Kosinski novel, keeps the focus on human suffering - some of it emotional, some of it physical - and though it's a mostly somber and grueling experience to sit through, Marhoul's continual use of closeups on the beatific face of the boy somehow humanizes the film.
 That proves to be quite an achievement with so much direness, especially in the actions of other people, going on around him. The boy's visit to the first of many villages along the road results in the locals believing he's an evil spirit. After being driven away, he's taken in by an old miller, his younger wife, and a mill worker. You've already been warned about the eyeball scene. He's soon on the road again, living with and working for a man who catches wild songbirds and sells them, and who is regularly visited by a young woman who gets pleasure out of giving the man pleasure.
 But wherever the boy lands, things go very wrong, for him and for others, and he is always right at the center, suffering and seeing others suffer. The journey continues, and he can do nothing but take it all in, rarely understanding what's happening. WWII rears its ugly head in attacks involving Germans, Russians, Cossacks, and villagers who have gotten in their way. An appalling sequence features Jewish prisoners breaking out of a moving train, only to be mowed down by Nazi soldiers. The boy is there, a witness to the aftermath and later, at another locale, becoming a victim of depravity.
 Part of the film's overwhelming strength is its detachment from some of these events, achieved by using very little dialogue and by filling the screen with unknown faces. A slight drawback is the recognizable cameos by Udo Kier, Harvey Keitel, Julian Sands, Stellan Skarsgard and Barry Pepper that briefly pull you out of the film's grip.
 Fortunately, everything keeps returning to the boy and his practically expressionless face and thoughts of how much more of this he can take. Remarkably, the film has an ending that achieves a degree of peace amidst the constant turmoil in the almost three hours that precede it.
 "The Painted Bird" premieres on VOD and streaming services on July 17.

Editor's note: This is a story in an occasional series of profiles The Daytona Beach News-Journal is publishing about people from Volusia and Flagler counties who've died as a result of contracting COVID-19. If you have a family member who died of coronavirus who you would like to see featured in a story, email Editor Pat Rice at pat.rice@news-jrnl.com. Or, call him at 386-681-8628.
   
 ORMOND BEACH -- Those who knew him will tell you there wasn't anything mechanical that Justyn Belter couldn't fix.
   
 "You just can't imagine," said Christine Belter, of Ormond Beach, his wife of 57 years. "He could fix anything and he never threw anything out because he could fix it."
   
 Belter, who traveled the world to distribute and install CO2 systems at breweries and soft drink companies, died on April 8 of the coronavirus. A resident of the Opis Coquina Center in Ormond Beach, he was 84.
   
 Born on March 21, 1936 in Buffalo, N.Y., Belter first exhibited his mechanical knack as a student at Seneca Vocational High School, said his younger brother Ken Belter, who still lives in the Buffalo area.
   
 His older brother also knew early on that he wanted to see the world, Ken said.
   
 Eventually, his career with the Wittemann Company in Palm Coast would take him to such far-flung destinations as Saudi Arabia, Russia, India, Turkey and Hong Kong, family members said.
   
 "When he was a kid he always wanted to travel," said Ken, 71. "That's what he always told me."
   
 Belter viewed his service in the U.S. Army as his first opportunity to fulfill that goal, though he never was stationed anywhere more exotic than Fort Campbell, Kentucky, his brother said.
   
 After his discharge, he returned to Buffalo, where he met his future wife at a German Day celebration.
   
 "I met him in 1961 and we got married in 1963," Christine said. "He was 25 and I was 19, a baby you could say. I liked his quiet manner, though he liked to talk a lot. We just got along; I can't really put my finger on it."
   
 Instead of splurging on a big wedding, the couple saved enough money to buy their first home in Buffalo, a purchase made before they exchanged vows, she said.
   
 "Nine months after we married, we had our daughter, Lisa," Christine said. A year and a half later, a son Jeffrey, arrived.
   
 In Buffalo, the Belter brothers over nearly two decades built a successful heating and air-conditioning business and also operated a company that sold blocks of ice.
   
 "He was very knowledgeable in the refrigeration business, with oil furnaces, oil burners," Ken said. "He had that kind of knack with most things electrical, with the engineering end of it."
   
 In Buffalo, Belter also fell in love with stock car racing. He was a fixture at races held at the city's Civic Stadium, which eventually would be renamed War Memorial Stadium and become home to the NFL's Buffalo Bills.
   
 At the track, Belter worked on engines and rubbed elbows with racing stars of the era such as "Wild Bill" Torrisi, who won championships there in 1957 and 1958, his brother said.
   
 "They had a cinder track that they paved and it was a ¼-mile," Ken said. "They raced stock cars, jalopies and midgets. We were avid fans."
   
 Volusia County's NASCAR history was a big attraction for Belter when the couple moved to Ormond Beach in 1980, his wife said.
   
 "He went down to the see the races a lot," Christine said. "He was glad to be down here to see NASCAR."
   
 Belter also liked to tinker with his own vehicles, a collection that at different points included an antique 1929 Ford and a mammoth 1965 Chrysler New Yorker, she said.
   
 Although Belter enjoyed telling stories about his travels, tales that involved everything from camel rides in Egypt to a meal at a floating diner in Hong Kong, the couple were content to be less adventurous after his retirement at age 62, Christine said.
   
 Aside from occasional trips to Savannah, Ga., or Charleston, S.C., diversions were all close to home.
   
 "We went fishing once in a while," she said. "Bowling, movies, normal things. 'You want to go to the movies tonight?' 'You want to grab a hamburger.' We felt like we were on vacation all the time here."
   
 In addition to his wife and brother, Belter also is survived by another brother, Ralph Belter, of Jacksonville; daughter Lisa Ballowe, of Buffalo, N.Y.; son Jeffrey Belter, of Huntersville, N.C. ; and four grandchildren.

Gregory Richard Delorme was born on January 7, 1926. Known in the family as Richard, he was the oldest son of William Delorme and Anastasia LaFrance who were married in 1925 and moved to Wakaw Saskatchewan, Canada, where Delorme relatives lived.A sickness went through the area in 1930 and took the lives of two younger brothers and a sister. The family then moved back to the area around Rolla, North Dakota.Richard's father died in 1934 when he was only eight years old. He attended grade school in Rolla, Notre Dame Academy in Willow City, ND, and in Hansboro, ND. Anastasia married John William Franklin Johnson who farmed near the village of Hansboro. They had three daughters and a son. These are a half-brother and three half-sisters to Richard. One daughter, Gloria, died February 3, 2004. A son, Frank Johnson died March 18, 2019. Daughters Chloie who lives in Stockton, CA, and Sally, who lives in Goldendale, WA, survive.Richard enlisted in the Navy in 1943 and was assigned to the Medical Corps. After medical training he obtained the rank of Pharmacist Mate and served in the South Pacific for the duration of the war. He received an honorable discharge in March 1946. He moved to Minneapolis in 1947 and married Elaine Fromm. Three sons and one daughter were born in this union. The two surviving sons are Terry who lives in Hawaii and Randy who lives in Fargo. The daughter Dawn Ella also lives in the Fargo area. The third son, Ricky, died in the mid 2000's.One of the most notable and endearing qualities of Gregory Delorme was, in spite of his modest means, a generosity in donating for the benefit of disadvantaged children. For many years he donated to national and international organizations that were primarily focused on the needs of poor children in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Now, in his Will, he has provided money for the establishment of the Gregory R. Delorme Scholarship Fund for aid to students in his parish and to be administered by the pastor.Years ago, when his younger brother asked him about a provision for him in his own Will, he immediately said it should go to scholarships for students in need at the university level. The example he demonstrated is particularly significant in this day and age with the emphasis on the need for more equality and justice in our country. His good values, generosity, outgoing and friendly disposition brought out large crowds to celebrate his birthday each year when he lived in the Country Club Mobile Home Park in Yuma.Richard was employed as a sheet metal worker for Stremel Brothers Manufacturing in Minneapolis, MN for twenty years. From 1972 to 1992 he owned a small farm near Leech Lake in the Walker/LaPorte area in Northern Minnesota. After that, he lived at various times in Minneapolis, New Mexico and Hawaii. He eventually ended up in Yuma, Arizona where he died on July 5, 2020 from the COVID-19.He is survived by two sons, one daughter, two half-sisters and a full brother Robert who lives in Huntington Beach, CA. One step sister celebrated her 104th birthday in June 2020. He has four grandchildren and several nieces and nephews and countless friends.He was preceded in death by one son in addition to the two brothers and one sister who died in early childhood in September 1930. He was also preceded in death by one half-sister and one half- brother.He will be buried next to his mother and father in the Saint Mary's Cemetery in Maryville Township, North Dakota.

AMMAN — World Youth Skills Day, which falls annually on July 15,  this year will take place in a challenging context due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, according to the UN.
 Designated by the General assembly in 2014, the World Youth Skills Day is an opportunity for young people, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions, and public and private sector stakeholders to acknowledge and celebrate the importance of equipping young people with skills for employment, decent work and entrepreneurship, according to the UN website
 Prior to the current crisis, young people aged 15-24 were three times more likely than adults to be unemployed and often faced a prolonged school-to-work transition period, it said.
 In post-COVID-19 societies, as young people are called upon to contribute to the recovery effort, they will need to be equipped with the skills to successfully manage evolving challenges and the resilience to adapt to future disruptions, the UN said.
 In light of the restrictions presented by the COVID-19 crisis, the UN took its panel session to the virtual format, under the theme “Skills for a Resilient Youth”, bringing together multiple stake holders in skills development.
 “The focus will be on helping young people be more resilient to changes caused by the current crisis and in the world of work in general,” according to the International Labour Organisation.
 With 63 per cent of its population under the age of 30, Jordan has one of the youngest populations in the world, according to UNICEF.
 Bayan Hatem, 22, who graduated in 2019, said that she had participated in training programmes for a whole year in the hope of developing her skills that would match today’s labour market demands.
 "Before the pandemic, accessing the labour market was hard and challenging due to economic difficulties. It is crucial for youth to learn a new skill or even develop an existing one, in order to engage in self-employment in case they do not find an adequate job,” Hatem told The Jordan Times over the phone.
 Meanwhile, Noor Manaseer, an instructor at an educational institute, said that they focus on lifelong skills in education, gearing towards helping young kids to build “a brighter future”.
 “Everything starts with those basic skills that could change communities, and later on those same kids will have the power to make all the difference in the world,” Manaseer said.

“Competency is something that is always in flux,” so judges can only assess it in the weeks or days before a firm execution date, he said.
 In a landmark 1986 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits putting someone to death who lacks a reasonable understanding of why he is being executed. It involved the case of Alvin Ford, who was convicted of murder but whose mental health deteriorated behind bars to the point where, according to his lawyer, he believed he was pope.
 Legal standards as to whether someone has a rational understanding of why an execution is taking place can be complex, Dunham explained.
 “I could say I was Napoleon,” he said. “But if I say I understand that Napoleon was sentenced to death for a crime and is being executed for it — that could allow the execution to go ahead.”

It cannot underinvest in LA’s aging infrastructure and public service, while welcoming so much speculative real estate. All of those McMansions, apartment towers, and commercial buildings need water, electric power, garbage collection, sanitary sewers, and street capacity. Even without a major earthquake, it is only a matter of time until this house of cards caves in on itself.

Aaron Nelson Kaufman      47 of Nashville, passed away unexpectedly on July 10, 2020. Aaron was born Nov. 12, 1972 to David Kaufman and the late Roberta (Bobbi) Kaufman Hanna and grew up outside of Glenmont, Ohio. He was a devoted husband and best friend to his wife, Jessica. Aaron spent much of his childhood and teenage years hunting and bow fishing with his good friends, Shannon Smith, Eric Snow, Mike Bruce, Dave Colter, Kurt Miller and Adam Campbell. He was also considered the best big brother a little sister could ask for to Leah. When he wasn't enjoying the Holmes County countryside with his buddies, Aaron played and excelled at several sports including football and track, qualifying in 1990 for the state track meet in the 4X100 relay. Aaron graduated from West Holmes High School in 1991 and went on to Ashland University to earn a teaching degree in business and later his superintendent's license. After securing a first job as a study hall monitor at West Holmes High School, Aaron spent the last 27 years working his way to the top of the administrative ladder, most recently taking on the role as the West Holmes superintendent.      Mr. Kaufman touched the lives of countless students while teaching business, coaching football, and serving as principal and athletic director for West Holmes High School. When Aaron took on the responsibility of helping to guide the youth of Holmes County, he squared his shoulders and became the man he was destined to be. He strove to be the best he could in all aspects of his life, and his patience, compassion, and fierce loyalty to the West Holmes School District will never be forgotten. Aaron's favorite pastime was being a dad and watching his children compete in football, basketball, soccer, wrestling, baseball and cheerleading. His children are thankful for his dedication to them, being a role model and pushing them to their full potential, and loving them with all his heart.      Surviving are his children, of the home, Thane Kaufman, Tucker Kaufman, Tori Kaufman, and step son, Hunter King; wife, Jessica Kaufman; a sister, Leah (Dean) Schaffter of Millersburg; father, David Kaufman of Orrville; nephews, Philip Schaffter, Kirk (Kallie) Schaffter, Robert (Raelyn) Schaffter, and Troy Schaffter; grandmothers, Betty Kaufman of Wooster, and Carol Didinger of Glenmont and numerous aunts, uncles and cousins. Aaron was greeted in Heaven by his mother, Bobbi (Kaufman) Hanna and grandfathers, Robert Didinger and David Kaufman.      A private, family service will be held. He will be laid to eternal rest at SS. Peter and Paul Catholic Church cemetery in Glenmont. Friends, colleagues, and current or former students who wish to help celebrate Mr. Kaufman's life are welcome to join the family at a celebration of life service, Sunday, July 19th at 7 p.m., that will be held at the West Holmes football stadium. In honor of Mr. Kaufman we will be following all social distancing guidelines. WKLM Radio FM 95.3 will broadcast the service live for those who are unable to attend. Guests are encouraged to wear West Holmes gear, gather together as one strong Knight Nation, and celebrate the legacy that Aaron leaves behind. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that memorial contributions be donated to the Aaron Kaufman Education Scholarship at the Holmes County Education Foundation. Those wishing to share a memory or make online condolences may do so by visiting www.alexanderfhinc.com.      Alexander Funeral Home, 330-674-4811

ICE did not immediately comment on the decision.
 The president of MIT said the school was pleased by the turn of events but stands ready “to protect our students from any further arbitrary policies.”
 “These students make us stronger, and we hurt ourselves when we alienate them,” President L. Rafael Reif said in a statement. “This case also made abundantly clear that real lives are at stake in these matters, with the potential for real harm. We need to approach policy making, especially now, with more humanity, more decency — not less.”
 Under the policy, international students in the U.S. would have been forbidden from taking all their courses online this fall. New visas would not have been issued to students at schools planning to provide all classes online, which includes Harvard. Students already in the U.S. would have faced deportation if they didn’t transfer schools or leave the country voluntarily.
 Immigration officials issued the policy last week, reversing the earlier guidance from March 13 telling colleges that limits around online education would be suspended during the pandemic. University leaders believed the rule was part of President Donald Trump’s effort to pressure the nation’s schools and colleges to reopen this fall even as new virus cases rise.
 The policy drew sharp backlash from higher education institutions, with more than 200 signing court briefs supporting the challenge by Harvard and MIT. Colleges said the policy would put students’ safety at risk and hurt schools financially. Many schools rely on tuition from international students, and some stood to lose millions of dollars in revenue if the rule had taken hold.
 Harvard and MIT were the first to contest the policy, but at least seven other federal suits had been filed by universities and states opposing the rule.
 The unexpected decision was welcome news to students across the country who had been on edge.

 Joe Biden targeted Texas with a modest advertising investment that raised new questions about President Donald Trump's vulnerability in the longtime Republican stronghold as coronavirus infections explode.
 Biden, the former vice president and the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee in 2020, ignores Trump completely in the new ad. He offers instead an uplifting message that allows voters to envision him as consoler in chief, a role that Republicans have repeatedly encouraged Trump to embrace to no avail.
 “This virus is tough, but Texas is tougher,” Biden says in the ad. “I want every single American to know, if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day, I will not abandon you. We’re all in this together.”
 Trump's campaign on Tuesday laughed off the small new investment, and even some Democrats were skeptical of Biden's chances in Texas. Yet Biden's modest step into a state that hasn't backed a Democrat for president in 44 years reflected the extent to which the pandemic threatens to scramble the electoral map this fall.
 As Democratic-led states like New York and New Jersey slow the spread, new infections and related deaths are surging across Republican-led states like Florida, Texas and Arizona that backed Trump four years ago and resisted aggressive health precautions through the spring.
 Even before the outbreak, Democrats considered Florida and Arizona top targets. Texas, which Democrats have long hoped would swing their way because of demographic trends, emerged as a possible pickup only after the pandemic intensified.
 Last week was the deadliest of the health crisis for Texas, and the hospital system is stretched to its limits in some regions. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has warned that the infection numbers will likely get even worse.
 "We are one of the hottest of the hot spots in the country," said Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who represents a portion of Dallas and its surrounding suburbs. “I think people in Texas can recognize what’s happening and connect the dots on who’s responsible for us having a lack of a response. And they're looking at Joe Biden as someone who has a very strong appeal.”
 Still, Allred isn't ready to predict a Biden victory in Texas this November.
 “I think that it’s possible. We still have a ways to go here," he said in an interview. "We will all be judged — from members of Congress to the president — on what we did and what we didn’t do during this crisis.”
 The Biden campaign said the Texas ad was part of a “mid-six-figure” investment also spread across Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. It's scheduled to run in each state’s top markets on local cable and on Sunday cable shows. Spanish- language-captioned versions will run in Arizona, Florida and Texas, in addition to YouTube, Facebook and Univision.
 Later in the week, the campaign plans to release a series of digital videos of Biden calling families of coronavirus victims in all four states.
 Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh described the investment as “a total phony" media buy designed to generate media coverage given its size.
 “We hope that Joe Biden thinks Texas is in play, and we encourage him to spend money there,” he said. That's money Biden cannot spend, Murtaugh continued, in four states that voted Democrat four years ago where Trump is running ads to try to flip: Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Nevada.
 “We have far more resources than Joe Biden does. He would have to outraise us by more than a million dollars a day every day until the election and he still couldn't catch us,” Murtaugh said, referencing the Trump campaign's massive cash advantage. “We encourage him to spend money in states like Texas. That is money down the drain.”
 Among Biden's team, there was some internal skepticism that Texas would become a legitimate top target.
 Money is a factor. Texas has nearly two dozen media markets. A serious bid there would likely require tens of millions of dollars. And beyond the campaign, outside groups aligned with Democrats have not signaled any serious interest in playing there.
 Molly Ritner, the deputy states director for the Biden campaign, said Trump's mismanagement of the pandemic has helped strengthen Biden’s opportunity in states like Arizona and Texas that were out of reach for Democrats in past elections.
 But it's not as if Biden was ignoring Texas until this month.
 The campaign notes it has hosted more than 50 organizing events since early March, including virtual phone banks and virtual community meetings. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke has been an active surrogate in recent days, and Biden recorded a video for the state Democratic convention last month.
 “What we have seen, whether it’s Texas or Arizona or Florida or North Carolina, is that Trump’s failed response to the pandemic and his complete mismanagement has taken these states ... that we thought we could have a real shot in and win, and made them even more competitive,” Ritner said. “Voters in these states are seeing firsthand what they get when they have a Trump presidency, and it’s scary.”
 Texas intensive care unit physician Robin Armstrong, who sits on the Republican National Committee, notes there has been a significant increase in coronavirus-related hospitalizations in recent weeks. Many are younger people who are recovering, he said.
 He called it “silly” to blame Trump for the surge.
 “I think we need to blame where the virus comes from, not knowing about it a lot earlier, and so I think we’ve had a lot of failures in our bureaucracy for sure,” he said, suggesting that the medical community and local governments should shoulder more blame for not offering more consistent messages.
 As for Trump's reelection prospects, Armstrong concedes that Trump's numbers are not strong — “especially in this environment right now.”
 “He polls low, but in the privacy of the voting booth, his numbers will go up considerably,” he said.
