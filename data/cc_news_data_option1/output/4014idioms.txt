Approximately 21 Appalachian State University faculty members emailed university board of trustees on Sept. 25 expressing concern about what they perceive as a lack of engagement with the university's Faculty Senate.
 The emails were sent after a series of events and communications between faculty and university officials. Faculty Senate Chair Michael Behrent sent an Aug. 24 email to faculty and Faculty Senate members stating that it was the group's goal to work constructively with administration, and that he hoped administrators would return to providing shared governance.
 The Aug. 24 email followed an Aug. 17 email that faculty senators received from Chancellor Sheri Everts and Interim Provost Heather Norris stating why they would not be in attendance of a Faculty Senate meeting that day. According to faculty senators, the university faculty handbook states that the chancellor shall meet with Faculty Senate at the group’s first and last meeting of each academic year. The Aug. 17 meeting was the group’s first for the academic year.
 The joint email noted resolutions on the group's agenda that day — including a resolution of no confidence in Everts.
 “Two members of Faculty Senate, including the senate parliamentarian, are named plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the university, the (University of North Carolina) system and Gov. Roy Cooper," stated the joint email to senators according to Behrent. "While university administrators typically attend Faculty Senate in support of shared governance, in light of the above and on the advice of counsel, no senior level university administrators attended today’s meeting.”
 At that time, Behrent said Norris had discontinued regular meetings with the senate's Budget Committee that have taken place since the spring. Behrent — who serves as a constituency representative during Appalachian Board of Trustee meetings — requested via email to present a five-minute Faculty Senate report during the trustees' Sept. 25 meeting. His request was subsequently denied by Hank Foreman, the university's vice chancellor and chief of staff.
 During the Sept. 25 annual App State Board of Trustees meeting, Faculty Senate members flooded the emails of trustee members to voice concerns about a lack of shared governance.
 Faculty Senator Rick Elmore, an assistant professor of philosophy, stated in his email that the COVID-19 crisis has brought an array of unprecedented challenges to campus, the community and the nation.
 "There has been deep disagreement between the majority of faculty and the administration over how best to handle our community's response to these challenges," Elmore wrote. "One of the central concerns of faculty has been the lack of shared governance on our campus: the failure of the administration to communicate clearly and honestly with faculty and the exclusion of faculty from meaningful involvement in decision making."
 In the context of ongoing concerns about shared governance, Elmore stated in his email that the board's refusal to allow Behrent to speak "communicates to faculty that our concerns and perspectives are not valued by the leadership of the institution to which so many of us have dedicated our professional lives."
 As a former chair of App State's Faculty Senate (2010-12), Jill Ehnenn — a professor and assistant chair of the Department of English —said in her email that shared governance with faculty has deteriorated steadily over the years, and increasingly so since March.
 Ehnenn added that faculty aren't asking for administrators to agree with them, but rather to engage with them. She said that faculty want to address topics such as decreased transparent communication from administrators, the handling of the pandemic, university goals to increase student enrollment, budget concerns, faculty salaries and instances where faculty have been given "disdain" by upper administration and the trustees, she said.
 Faculty Senator Emily Dakin, an associate professor in the Department of Social Work, requested in her email that both administrators and that the App State Board of Trustees meet with representatives from the Faculty Senate.
 Everts said during the Sept. 25 trustees meeting that university officials have reimagined and redefined the university experience at App State since March. She gave an overview of what all the university has accomplished to reach this point in the year such as purchasing three face coverings for every student, faculty and staff member; hiring 50 additional staff for increased frequency of cleaning and regular sanitizing; and testing more than 1,000 students nearly each week since allowing them back on campus.
 Additionally, faculty have adjusted their teaching methods while deans and department chairs ensure that course delivery needs are met, she said. According to Everts, 48 percent of classes are being taught remotely and 52 percent are hybrid or fully face-to-face instruction.
 "In the last six months, we’ve had to recreate what took those who came before us more than 120 years to develop," Everts said. "This effort has been nothing short of super human."
 Everts added that each week of the fall 2020 semester the university completes is a significant accomplishment. She said the safety and wellbeing of students, faculty, staff and of the greater community remain at the forefront of university decisions.
 "We are all weary with the effects this pandemic continues to have in our daily lives, but we cannot become complacent. It is our responsibility to remain diligent and disciplined. Doing so will keep our students and faculty in Boone and on campus, our staff and faculty employed and our local economy supported."
 Administrators would be remiss to not plan for budget reductions as a result of the pandemic, Everts said. She mentioned the July request from the North Carolina Board of Governors to UNC system institutions to submit plans for “worst-case” 25-50 percent budget cuts.
 While those scenarios are unlikely, Everts said the university is expecting at least a 10 percent reduction next fiscal year. University Academic Affairs staff recently completed a reorganization of the enrollment management and marketing functions of main campus undergraduate programs, grad programs and online programs that eliminated administration level positions. This saved the university more than $900,000 annually, according to Everts.
 Additionally, Everts said the 20,023 students enrolled for the fall semester meant the university experienced a 3 percent increase in undergraduate students since 2019, 11 percent growth in graduate students and 18 percent increase in online degree programs.
 "Moving forward, we recognize we cannot continue to grow on campus indefinitely," Everts said. "Yet we take seriously our educational mission and responsibility to educate the citizens of the state of North Carolina. We are looking at areas that have growth capacity and market potential for both on campus and online programs."

One positive test could derail that timeline.
 If allowed back inside the team’s headquarters Wednesday, that would keep the Titans (3-0) on target to host Buffalo (4-0) on Sunday in a matchup of two of the NFL’s six remaining undefeated teams. Vrabel says he’s working through a variety of schedules to be ready for when they can get back.
 The NFL and its players union had people in Nashville meeting with the Titans to review how the team handled the outbreak and checking protocols. The Titans, and any other team with an outbreak or exposed to a team with an outbreak, now have new protocols to follow including all meetings held virtually and everyone must wear face coverings and gloves at practice.
 Vrabel said the Titans followed the protocols that were in place and that both he and general manager Jon Robinson put a lot of thought into doing just that.
 “We’re going to continue to do everything that we can to make sure as we enter back in this building, that things are safe and the players are comfortable and that their health and well-being is at the forefront,” Vrabel said.
 The Titans’ outbreak reached 20 cases on Sunday, the team’s sixth straight day of at least one positive, with 18 returned since Sept. 29.
 The players testing positive include defensive captain DaQuan Jones, defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, wide receiver Adam Humphries, rookie cornerback Kristian Fulton and long snapper Beau Brinkley.
 Vrabel said those players have to follow a protocol to be cleared to return to play, keeping them out of Sunday’s game with the Bills, but Vrabel is hopeful they’ll get most of the personnel affected back, and any coaches still not cleared to return won’t have a role in the game.
 The Titans, who’ve won all three games by a combined six points and a made field goal inside the final two minutes of each victory, will need a long snapper. Vrabel said he and Robinson have been working through that.
 The NFL has extended the time teams need to bring in players for tryouts.

An FIR has been registered against Madhya Pradesh's former Chief Minister and Congress leader Kamal Nath and eight others, under multiple sections of IPC and Disaster Management Act, for violation of Covid-19 norms during a public meeting in the state.
 The FIR was registered on Tuesday at Bhander police station in Datia district against Nath and eight others on the basis of a written complaint by Sub- Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Arvind Mahor on Monday.
 According to the FIR copy, applicant Nahar Singh Yadav, district Congress chief has sought permission for holding a meeting at Mandi premises in Bhander on October 5. Permission was granted for the gathering of 100 people with the condition of adhering to Covid-19 norms.
 The party held a poll meeting at Bhander in Datiya where Nath, party candidate Pool Singh Baraiya and others were present.
   
   
 The police in the FIR copy said after seeing footage from the poll meeting, "it was evident that 2,000-2,500 persons were present as against permission of 100 persons allowed, which violated Covid-19 safety guidelines and Section 144 of CrPC."
 Voting on 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh by-polls will take place on November 3 and the results will be declared on November 10, the Election Commission of India had announced. The last date for filing the nomination papers is October 16. Scrutiny of nomination papers will take place the next day, while nomination papers can be withdrawn by October 19, according to the bypoll schedule.
 By-elections are due on 28 seats which fell vacant following the resignations of 24 Congress MLAs and the death of two legislators earlier.
 In March, 22 Congress MLAs resigned from the state Assembly paving the way for BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan to take over as Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister for the fourth time.

We have seen what happens when that happens at speedway races. We typically take off in flight and end up upside down. I don't know if that is ideally the best solution. I don't know what the solution is. I know that the line is intended to detour from going way down there and causing bigger or more wrecks but it seems like we wreck regardless. I don't know the solution. We are going to wreck. You have 40 cars all on top of each other going close to 200 mph and we are running into each other to try to go faster. We are bump drafting and attaching and pushing and trying to side draft extremely aggressively. All of those things are a recipe for wrecks which is why it is entertaining for the fans and people tune in but for us and from the drivers perspective it just puts you in that position where you know you are going to wreck. If you don't, you will have a good shot to win.”

FALL RIVER - More than six month after closing to audiences, the Narrows Center for the Arts is ready to welcome at least some of its music fans back for concerts. This month, the venue will also open its new yoga space on the second floor.
 Under the latest guidelines released by Gov. Charlie Baker, the Narrows Center for the Arts is able to open again to a limited number of patrons. It's news Narrows Executive Director Patrick Norton, has been hoping to hear for months and now the center is geared up for its first concert on Friday, Oct. 8, with Steve Forbert.
 Under Baker's guidelines, lower risk communities - those that have not been designated as red for the last three weekly Department of Public Health reports -- were moved into Step II of Phase III as of Oct. 5. That step allows for indoor performance venues to open with a maximum capacity of 250.
 Reiterating the governor's reasoning for the expansion due to the fact that states that have had similar "highly organized" events haven't had significant increases in COVID-19 spikes, Norton said it's essential for everyone to wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. "That's the key to moving forward," he added.
 By the 50 percent rule, Norton said they could put 250 people in the arts venue for a concert, but on opening they're being extra cautious by limiting the first few tickets to 175. "People are confident that the Narrows runs a quality operation and that we care about our fans," he said. "I think there's a desire for live music. It's been shut down for a long time and I think the governor has given us an opportunity and it's up to venues and the fanbase…. We've got a whole COVID plan in place."
 Norton said they thought they might be allowed to bring back 25 percent of its audience in August, so planning began this summer for how it would look once fans returned. The venue has also been gearing up for the opening of its 2,500 square-foot yoga space, which will happen on Oct. 14. Yoga will be offered every Wednesday at 10 a.m. and every Saturday at 9 a.m. with tickets being sold for the classes on the Narrows' website. "We've got a big (yoga) space to put 20 people in with lots of ventilation," he added. "We were gearing up for yoga and serendipitously the governor said we can do shows. These are all coming together."
 In preparation for welcoming back fans, they have relocated the seating 14 feet away from the stage. Seats are arranged in pods of either one, two or four and those pods are spaced six-feet apart in all directions. Fans will have to purchase tickets in pods of one, two or four. "We have a large space. If you just went on our square footage alone, we have room for 550," said Norton.
 In the hard-hit music industry, Norton said they're fortunate to be able to welcome back fans though it will be a long road back for everyone in the industry. Citing a survey in Pollstar magazine, he said 89 percent of respondents said there should be shared responsibility in the financial implications of COVID-19. "Meaning that we're all going to have to take less money to get going - that's agents, promoters, venues, musicians - to get this thing up and running. That's just the way it is," said Norton. "It's going to be a long road back in the music industry. I found that interesting, but most of the people in the music business do it because they love music."
 Over the past few months, the Narrows has built up a new following to its YouTube page where the arts venue has been streaming live concerts from the venue on Friday nights. "We've had a great response from our patrons in both financially and viewership. We've got one of the higher rated live-streams around," said Norton.
 Even with the ability to open to a limited number of patrons, Norton said they will continue those live-streaming concerts. In part, he said that's due to the fact that they have become popular with audiences, but also to serve that segment of the Narrows audience that is likely not going to return to the arts center until there is a COVID-19.
 "Testing is the way back. It's going to be hard to get back to full capacity until they come up with an 'insta test,' that you can get results in five or 10 minutes when people come in," said Norton. "They're not going to open up the big stadiums until they have testing."
 For now, Norton is adding more shows to the lineup for the Narrows' venue this fall.
 Baker's Step 2 Phase 3 expansion also allows for fitting rooms to open in retail stores, at arcades and indoor and outdoor recreation businesses, additional Step II activities such as trampolines, obstacle courses, roller rinks and laser tag will also be permitted and capacity will increase to 50 percent. Gyms, museums, libraries and driving and flight schools will also be permitted to increase their capacity to 50 percent.

And that’s exactly what they did.
 Yimi Garcia took over and Freddie Freeman grounded into a forceout that left runners at the corners. Marcell Ozuna lined a single to left that made it 4-all.
 Then d’Arnaud, in his first season with Atlanta, belted a slider over the fence in center field for a three-run drive that made it 7-4. The shot caused the Braves dugout to erupt with Acuña jumping over the railing to celebrate.
 D’Arnaud, who played for the Mets, Dodgers and Rays last year, began the day as a .169 career hitter in the postseason, striking out 27 times in 83 at- bats.
 But the Braves weren’t done yet.
 James Hoyt replaced Garcia with one out and Swanson sent his first pitch off the wall in center field for a two-run homer.
 “The tide kind of turned,” Miami manager Don Mattingly said. “We get that three-run lead, and then we give two runs right back. From there, really, we got stopped all day.”
 The Braves, who have long dominated the Marlins in the NL East, improved to 3-0 this postseason after sweeping the Reds in the wild-card round for their first playoff series win since 2001.
 The Marlins overcame a coronavirus outbreak that sidelined more than half the team in July to make the playoffs for the first time since 2003 before sweeping their wild-card series against the Cubs.
 And the scrappy Marlins, who lost 105 games in 2019, looked good early in this one, using a three-run third inning to take a 4-1 lead. But their offense stalled after that and the Braves scored two in the third to get within one before putting Miami away with their home run barrage in the seventh.
 The Braves got the win despite a tough start from Max Fried, who allowed six hits and a season-high four runs in just four innings. He was picked up by a bevy of relievers who allowed just one run over the last five innings. Will Smith pitched a perfect seventh for the win.
 Alcantara yielded eight hits and five runs with eight strikeouts in six-plus inning.
 Atlanta’s scoreless streak in the playoffs ended early in this one when Miguel Rojas homered to the seats in left field to make it 1-all in the second.
 Garrett Cooper hit a two-run double to put the Marlins up 3-1 in the third. Brian Anderson followed with an RBI single.
 Ozuna doubled with two outs in the inning to score Acuña, and d’Arnaud followed with an RBI double to cut the lead to 4-3.
 UP NEXT
 Right-hander Pablo Lopez will make his postseason debut when he starts for the Marlins in Game 2 against Ian Anderson. Lopez was 6-4 with a 3.61 ERA in 11 starts this season.
 Anderson allowed two hits and struck out nine in six scoreless innings to get the win in Atlanta’s win over Reds in Game 2 of the wild card series.

Teachers come in each day to instruct via computers, giving lectures and doing the difficult job of holding accountable students that aren’t physically present. Kids are generally getting the hang of log-ins, teachers say, and relying on the district’s new media specialist for all manner of technology questions. Buses depart daily to deliver hundreds of packaged meals to recipients in a sprawling area that ranges from Riverton to Beaver Creek. Staff keep tabs on attendance, and teachers and others call or conduct in- person visits if kids go dark for a couple days.

Coincidentally, Yankees third base coach Phil Nevin was a slugger for the Padres when Petco Park opened in 2004 with vast outfield dimensions. He and Ryan Klesko groused about how they'd crush a ball that would be a homer in other parks, only to watch it go for a long out. Nevin once hit a double that he thought should have been a homer. After reaching second, he gestured angrily toward general manager Kevin Towers' box. The two later had words in the clubhouse.
