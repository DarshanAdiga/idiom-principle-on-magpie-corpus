"The magnitude of them, too, two walkoffs and one that ties the game on the road in the ninth," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "Can't explain it. You just try to get the pitcher on the defensive."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Sure, Stephen Piscotty realizes there's a little bit of luck involved when it comes to hitting with the bases loaded and delivering not once but twice already during this coronavirus-shortened season. “It’s pretty cool,” Piscotty said. “It’s a weird game, a crazy game.

The Giants hadn't lost after leading by five or more runs in the ninth inning or latter since June 25, 1929. Matt Chapman began on second base with the new extra-innings rule and advanced on Matt Olson's groundout to bring up Canha. He hit a flyball to right off Jarlin García (0-1). Joakim Soria (2-0) escaped trouble in the ninth for the win, and Liam Hendriks finished for his sixth save. The A's delivered another dramatic late-game grand slam. Olson hit one to beat the Angels in 10 innings on opening night. Piscotty had another in walkoff fashion in a win over the Rangers earlier this month. “The magnitude of them, too, two walkoffs and one that ties the game on the road in the ninth,” A's manager Bob Melvin said. “Can’t explain it. You just try to get the pitcher on the defensive.” Until Piscotty's mighty swing, the Giants were beating the slugging A's at their own power game. Hunter Pence hit a three-run homer, and Evan Longoria and Mike Yastrzemski also connected to back Johnny Cueto. The right-hander struck out five over seven strong...
