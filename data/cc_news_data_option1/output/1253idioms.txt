Morris Mayer’s small upholstery shop, Plaza Park Interiors in Mamaroneck, is usually very busy. The seamstresses especially are used to the hectic nature of the business and the cutting tables are always filled with deadline driven projects for clients.


  Mayer, a Scarsdale resident for 10 years, has more than 30 years’ experience in the industry. He worked his way up through the business originally working as a drapery installation helper. But when he finally began working for a company that had a fully functioning workroom, that’s when things began to click.


  “You got to see what goes on … behind the scenes and all the blood, sweat and tears that goes into making [products],” he said. “That’s what really intrigued me; how it’s made. Getting it from raw material to finished product.”

Dillian Whyte's heavyweight clash with Alexander Povetkin is set to become the latest victim of coronavirus but boxing could return behind closed doors in June, according to British promoter Eddie Hearn.


  "We will make an official announcement today (about the Whyte fight) but basically, yes (the show is off)," Hearn told Talksport radio on Monday.


  "The problem is nobody knows, but we all hope we can return to some kind of boxing in June.


  "Whether that's behind closed doors at first, or whether that's back with small-hall shows then we hope we can get to the bigger shows before the end of June."


  Britain's Whyte was due to take on Russia's Povetkin on May 2 in Manchester.


  Britain is also home of heavyweight champions Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua and Fury's recent win against American Deontay Wilder has led to talk of an all-British showdown.


  Hearn said July 25 would be a more realistic date for Joshua's defence of his IBF, IBO and WBA title belts against Bulgaria's Kubrat Pulev at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.


  He said the scheduled date of June 20 could fall within the domestic football season if it was resumed.


  "I know there's a bigger picture going on but everyone in sport right now needs to be working on a solution," said Hearn.


  "It's going to be an horrifically messy time for sports and businesses when we do come out of the other side, because the world won't be the same again."

“We’ve done really well,” Phil King said.


  Gina King said the family has been in spring break mode even though they couldn’t travel and expects the stay-at-home order to hit them on Monday.


  “It will be very different not going back to school,” she said. “There will be no school activities.”


  Last week, Connor was socializing with people at the local basketball court, something that he probably won’t do again for the immediate future.


  “I wouldn’t feel comfortable with that now,” Gina King said. “You don’t know where people have been, who they have been around.”


  “This is very real,” she said. “It’s impacting your daily life.”


  She tells her sons that they are making history right now.


  “People will be talking about this for the rest of your life,” she said. “It’s like 9/11, everyone remembers where they were at the time.”


  Both parents expect life in the future will be different in many ways because of the pandemic.


  Phil King said there will be an impact on both the local and national economy.


  “I think about our local families,” Gina King said. “We see families every day that are struggling already. With the possible loss of jobs and out of work, they will have trouble making ends meet.”


  Thinking of the future, Connor said people will be more aware of their safety and will become more cautious.


  “I hope the country will rally around each other, like what happened after 9/11,” Phil King said.

In the Chinese city of Wuhan, the wet market that spawned the pandemic which has brought the world to its knees now slumbers quietly behind a tidy-looking blue-and-white partition.


  But there are ample clues that something toxic once lurked inside the Huanan Seafood Market -- police tape, chest-high red barriers, and staff in head-to- toe white hazmat suits lugging equipment.


  Chinese disease control officials have previously identified wild animals sold in the market as the source of the coronavirus pandemic that has taken more than 33,000 lives worldwide so far and rocked the global economy.


  A price list issued by one merchant at the sprawling emporium, which circulated on China's internet in January, contained a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife including civets, rats, snakes, giant salamanders and even live wolf pups.


  Markets such as this are the final stop in what conservationists say is a brutal trade in wild animals that is fuelled in large part by Chinese consumption.


  It caters to an enduring demand for wild animals as exotic menu items or for use in traditional medicines whose efficacy is not confirmed by science.


  The Wuhan market was sealed and disinfected beginning in January after the outbreak began to spread.


  Now only disinfecting crews go in and out. Long red banners stretch across the temporary blue wall, exhorting passersby to do their part in the fight against the virus.


  \- Disappearing act -


  As the global health disaster has intensified, sparking tension between Beijing and Washington, the birthplace of the virus has since disappeared by behind the temporary blue-and-white wall, and an inner curtain of black sheeting.


  Mentions of the site have likewise disappeared from government epidemic discourse and official media reports, as some Chinese officials have pushed a new narrative that the virus might not have originated in the market, while offering no evidence.


  After a more than two-month lockdown to contain the virus, in which citizens of Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province were confined to their homes, life is inching back toward normality.


  Border controls are loosening, allowing residents who were stranded outside the province -- as well as foreign journalists -- to begin re-entering in recent days.


  But the market's fate seems sealed.


  For weeks, crews have carefully disinfected and then removed all of its merchandise and other contents, followed by further rounds of disinfecting the entire site, according to state media reports.


  The market is slated for permanent closure, according to the reports, though no plans to demolish the site have been announced.


  China has, however, announced plans for a "comprehensive" ban on the wildlife trade that reportedly flourished there.


  It was not immediately clear what locals in the area thought of the continued presence of the market, which lies among tall and modern residential blocks.


  Adjacent streets remained deserted on Monday, with transport controls and other restrictions on movement still in place throughout the city.


  But one local community official shrugged off the market's toxic legacy, telling AFP: "I don't think local people have any fear when they get near the market."

Now, Mayer and his four seamstresses are using those skills to try to help during the COVID-19 pandemic, by producing cotton masks for area hospitals. New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed all nonessential businesses to close last week, which meant shops like Mayer’s were shuttered indefinitely.


  “Being that we couldn’t operate making curtains or anything because that’s not … essential, [I thought] ‘We have cotton fabrics, let’s make the masks,’” said Mayer, who was able to keep his shop open because he also runs a cleaning and sanitation service business out of the building, which is considered essential.


  After seeing social media posts about the need for surgical masks to protect doctors and nurses on the COVID-19 frontlines, Mayer decided to heed the call for mask production. At first, he was unsure how to go about making a mask and didn’t know if his shop had the right materials to produce masks with proper filtration. But, after getting advice from a medical professional on what the needs of the medical community are, Mayer and his employees stitched up a prototype mask by Tuesday.


  “It’s mainly … getting the right materials and sewing it as to where it will be effective,” said Mayer.


  Using some excess fabric from other client projects, the 100% cotton masks with a small pocket for inserting filters have a dual use purpose. Not only can the masks be used by medical professionals with the filter, the masks can also be fitted over any one-time use surgical mask to help extend its protective span.


  “Those masks that were once one time use [will] now be covered, so the outside won’t be contaminated,” said Mayer. “So instead of them having to throw them out at the end of the day, or changing them frequently” workers will be able to wash and sanitize the cloth masks for reuse.


  “It keeps you sane also,” he said. “You know you’re doing a good thing. It keeps you away from the media, it keeps you away from all the negativity and panic and you just know you’re working toward a solution. Mainly to help the people on the frontlines.”

NEW YORK (AP) — A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds is scheduled to arrive Monday morning in New York Harbor to help relieve the coronavirus crisis gripping the city's hospitals. The USNS Comfort, which was sent to New York City after 9/11, will be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while hospitals treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Gov. Andrew Cuomo was expected to greet the vessel when it reaches the harbor and docks at a Manhattan cruise ship terminal. In addition to the 1,000 beds, the Comfort has 12 operating rooms that could be up and running within 24 hours. The ship’s arrival comes as New York state's death toll from the coronavirus outbreak climbed Sunday above 1,000, less than a month after the first known infection in the state. Most of those deaths have occurred in just the past few days. New York City, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, reported Sunday that its toll had risen to 776. The total number of statewide deaths isn't expected to be released until Monday, but with at least 250 additional deaths recorded outside the city as of Sunday morning, the state's total fatalities was at least 1,026.

  As a precaution, the dining room has been closed and meals are delivered to residents in their apartments instead.

The global conductive plastic boxes market is expected to witness sizeable demand during the next ten years. Conductive plastic boxes are available in a variety of configurations and are mostly used for shipping and storage purposes. One of the most common hurdles in the electronics industry is the movement of static sensitive products such as circuit boards in production plants and from contract manufacturing sites to the OEMs. This is where conductive plastic boxes come in. The conventional way is to pack the boards in a bag, and load them onto corrugated totes. However, with the advent of ESD packaging formats such as conductive plastic boxes, logistics is witnessing a quick shift from traditional ESD protection methods. One of the key drivers for the conductive plastic boxes market is the availability of returnable transport packaging. Although the corrugated totes used in traditional methods have low cost, conductive plastic boxes are helpful in the long run, as they can be reused, unlike corrugated totes. End use industries such as the healthcare ad defense are expected to witness increased investment from developing countries in the next decade. Therefore, most of the growth factors are expected to be contributed from developing countries.
