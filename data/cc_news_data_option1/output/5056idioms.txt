Pete Conroy, director of the Environmental Policy and Information Center at JSU, told the commission the particulars of the proposed spur trail.
 “It’s about four miles as the crow flies,” Conroy said as he expounded on the virtues and benefits of ecotourism in Cleburne County.
 Conroy had been a proponent of the Chief Ladiga Trail during its inception — which passes through Cleburne County — and said, “folks were against it before they were for it.”
 “The Chief Ladiga Trail has worked out great, Canyon Center, same concerns up there, things worked out great,” said Conroy.
 “The type of person that you would attract would have expendable income,” said Conroy.
 Conroy said if the request for funds from ADECA are approved, consultants would be hired and eventually a public hearing would be held.
 “If all things work out it might actually work, it’s an opportunity and I know there are funds in the ADECA account right now,” said Conroy.

The 41-year-old director shot an untitled supernatural horror movie during the summer in the Canadian region of British Columbia.      Neill has also penned the script for the film, which features a cast consisting mainly of Canadian actors.      Plot details on the project are being kept under wraps but the movie is expected to finish production in the spring of next year. Blomkamp's long-time collaborator Julian Clarke is editing the flick with Byron Kopman as the director of photography.      Blomkamp had initially planned to make the sci-fi thriller 'Inferno' which Taylor Kitsch was attached to star in but the coronavirus pandemic dashed the plans and convinced Neill to turn his attention to a smaller production.      It will mark the first time Neill has been behind the camera on a feature film since 'Chappie' in 2015 and he previously explained how he turned his back on Hollywood movies because he grew tired of having "brain-numbing discussions" with movie studios.      Explaining the reasoning behind his approach, he said: "There's definitely no formula or precedent, really, for it. But it doesn't come from a place of wanting to go back to short films.      "It comes from a place of wanting to be able to do what I want to do and express what I want to express without having to have brain-numbing discussions about the political studio point of view of what they think the right move is. And obviously, you can't spend tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars on large-scale feature films with an approach like this.      "Definitely not at the beginning. So the short film result is simply like a function of the financial pressure - it's not that that's the goal."

But for me personally, the benefits, certainly of kids' rugby, still vastly outweigh the risks. Quite apart from the fitness and the teamwork (which of course you could get through playing other sports) rugby is unusual in terms of teaching children how to make and receive tackles, how to manage physical contact, how to cope with a bit of pain, how to overcome fear. That feeling of camaraderie; of protecting your team-mates and having them do the same for you in return. I’ve seen children grow hugely in confidence on the rugby field. I played myself for 20-odd years on and off (albeit as a namby-pamby back) and will certainly still encourage my son to play for now.

One thing about hunting public land, especially on weekends, is the likelihood that you will encounter other hunters, which means courtesy is paramount.
 “If you go to an area you had in mind to hunt and see a vehicle parked there, go to plan B or plan C,” Smith said. “Have respect for the other users. If you do, you generally get the same respect in return. Take it slow, practice hunting safety and be respectful of your public hunting brothers and sisters.”
 To hunt the WMAs, you’ll need a valid statewide hunting license, a WMA license, and either a printed WMA permit for the area you plan to hunt or registration on the Outdoor AL app on your smartphone.

 “Equity for all graduate students, no matter their individual circumstance, is what we are striving for,” Simon Cloutier, from the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest — the NWT’s French education board, said in a statement. “Those students that wish to write the diploma exams continue to have the option to do so.”
 “We strongly encourage all students that are registered in courses that include diploma exams to carefully consider their choice of postsecondary studies and their requirements prior to taking this important decision,” he added.
 This option will be available for the January 2021 and April 2021 exams and the summer school sessions in June 2021, and August 2021.
 Students who choose to write a diploma exam but are "dissatisfied with their mark are not eligible for an exemption," according to a statement from ECE.
 The department added students were responsible for reaching out to post- secondary institutions and asking if they could still be admitted without taking the diploma exam.

The Red Cross is testing blood, platelet and plasma donations for COVID-19 antibodies. The test may indicate if the donor’s immune system has produced antibodies to this coronavirus, regardless of whether an individual developed COVID-19 symptoms. Red Cross antibody tests will be helpful to identify individuals who have COVID-19 antibodies and may now help current coronavirus patients in need of convalescent plasma transfusions. Convalescent plasma is a type of blood donation collected from COVID-19 survivors that have antibodies that may help patients who are actively fighting the virus.


  COVID-19 antibody test results will be available within one to two weeks in the Red Cross Blood Donor App or donor portal at RedCrossBlood.org. A positive antibody test result does not confirm infection or immunity. The Red Cross is not testing donors to diagnose illness, referred to as a diagnostic test. To protect the health and safety of Red Cross staff and donors, it is important that individuals who do not feel well or believe they may be ill with COVID-19 postpone donation.

The ABC and the European Union diplomats were disgusted and appalled at the Region Four Returning Officer’s barefaced attempt to produce fake and artificial numbers in front of the world, in the advent of social media. He was not wise enough to anticipate the powerful impact of the social media which helped to discredit his hoax. The Western diplomats’ refusal to accept his scam have led to death threats, and a series of scathing and disparaging criticisms on them that were baseless, untruthful and spurious, to say the least. Similar threats and criticisms were made against the chairs of GECOM and CARICOM, the OAS, the Commonwealth of Nations and in particular to the former Prime Ministers of Barbados and Jamaica.

He increases his votes with Hispanic Americans, African-Americans. State legislatures that Republicans control we kept all those plus, increase those numbers. You can just go down the line, he won 19 of the 20 bellwether counties. He won Ohio by eight, Florida by three yet somehow he doesn’t win. So we know we need to look at all this.

The Maltipoo firmly believes they are a member of the family and should be treated as such. They need to be indoors with their humans, and they may even designate a spot on the couch as their own. Maltipoos aren't huge fans of being outdoors. No need for a big backyard to please this pup--they actually thrive in apartments and smaller spaces. That said, they still need daily exercise to burn out their (sometimes high) energy. Maltipoos can also be noisy and will alert their family if they see or hear something out of the ordinary. If they'll be living close to neighbors, they'll need consistent training to learn what's worth a bark and what's not. Need help?

One look at a Doberman should absolutely tell you these guys aren't couch potatoes. While a Dobie can adapt to living in an apartment, they're still going to need some daily outside time, the AKC says. A good run or a vigorous game of fetch should do the trick, though the breed will also be more than happy to participate in obedience, agility, or flyball competitions as well. Dobermans can do well with other dogs and even cats if they are socialized properly at a young age. While the dogs have high territorial instincts, they don't have much in the way of prey drive and shouldn't be too concerned with chasing smaller animals out of the yard.

Good news! Rat terriers are pretty close to a "set it and forget it" breed when it comes to grooming. Once a week brushing paired with a hose down every four to six weeks should be all you need to keep yours looking shiny and clean, the AKC says. Farm or working dogs will naturally require a little more maintenance, and apartment dogs might need a little less, but by and large, the rat terrier is blessed with a coat that is short enough to not mat up and naturally oily enough to not hold on to dirt. They are seasonal shedders, so make sure you've got a shedding tool or rubber curry brush handy to collect the excess, or resign yourself to having hair everywhere twice a year.

SPOKANE, Wash. (KXLY) - Two young children escaped from an apartment fire in Washington by jumping from a third-story window. Neighbors were there to catch them and help them to safety.Trevor Main heard a bloodcurdling scream Tuesday morning and ran over to the Regal Ridge Apartments, where he saw a young boy hanging from a third-story apartment window with black smoke coming from behind him.“It kept going and going, and then, your hairs kind of stand up,” Main said.Another witness says a little girl jumped out the window first, but the boy didn’t. So, Main broke down the door, prepared to risk his life to save the child.“He looked like he didn’t want to jump out of that window because that’s scary, so if you can get in through the apartment and get him out that way, you have to try,” Main said.When Main couldn’t get through the smoke, he and other neighbors finally convinced the boy to jump from the window and helped catch him as he fell.“He bumped his face on the rocks pretty good, but as long as he’s OK, that’s all we cared about,” Main said.The boy was taken to the hospital and is expected to be OK.The children’s mother was also home at the time of the fire. Main says she told him the Christmas tree sparked the blaze. Firefighters have not confirmed the cause.Three cats were killed in the fire, and the family’s apartment was destroyed. Many others were damaged.Main says he’s just thankful everyone is OK.Copyright 2020 KXLY via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

Failure to report true facts during a public health crisis is felony. Charge a few labs, drag them into court. Put fear of prosecution into state labs. You’re on the right track. You’ve made a major breakthrough. You see the con at work. You don’t want your state to be pressured into lockdowns based on fake case numbers derived from deceptive tests. Now make sure your enforcement personnel crack down on reluctant labs. Go the distance. If labs have equipment pre-set for the number of cycles, and they don’t know how to get inside the equipment to find that number, bring in pros who will do the job for them. I believe you’ll uncover a major scandal. Much of that equipment will be pre-set for 40 cycles. Keep updating the public on what you discover. Blow this crime wide open. Keep a very close eye on your public health officials. Among them, you’ll find agents who don’t want the truth to emerge. They’ll try to sabotage your good efforts every which way they can.

Lhasas will tolerate being left alone for reasonable periods of time, but think twice if you have neighbors who would be disturbed by any warning barking while you're away. "They are not a 'yappy' dog, but with their keen hearing, they will alert you to unexpected events," Evans says. Their small size might make them seem like ideal apartment dogs, but their bark might prove otherwise.

Take one look at a purebred bichon and you'll fall in love, instantly. Bichons can be anywhere from 12-18 pounds and stand between 9.5 and 11.5 inches. Their coat is always white, their eyes and noses black. They have a double coat, meaning that even though they're low-shedding, they can be high maintenance when it comes to grooming. The outer coat stands away from the body, giving them that signature cotton ball appearance.

It was a state socialism in which, as an American admirer of the German system, Frederic Howe, expressed it in his book on _Socialized Germany_ (1915): “The state has its finger on the pulse of the worker from the cradle to the grave. His education, his health and his working efficiency are matters of constant concern.” And if this all seems too paternalistic, Howe said, “This paternalism does not necessarily mean less freedom to the individual than that which prevails in America or England. It is rather a different kind of freedom,” of social welfare guarantees (pp. 83; 162) Howe later served in FDR’s New Deal Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) that attempted to plan the output of American farming. (See my article, “America’s Progressives are Bismarck’s Grandchildren”.)

They require regular brushing to keep ongoing shedding under control, and daily attention in the spring and fall, when their coat is going through its seasonal transformation known as "blowing coat." Sammies in colder climates have less reason to shed, but you're not off the hook completely. Keep a pin brush, metal comb, and slicker brush on hand, and a professional groomer on speed-dial.

German shepherds have thick, double-layered coats that require weekly brushing to combat frequent shedding, according to the AKC. German shepherds shed profusely during the spring and fall, and you'll want to brush once or even twice a day to keep up with these seasonal changes. Unless they roll in something stinky or take a dive into the occasional mud puddle, German shepherds rarely require baths as most debris can be swept away with a brush.

Because borzoi are running dogs, a home with a large, fenced-in yard is best for the breed. Apartment-dwellers should be dedicated to providing regular, thorough exercise for a borzoi. They're excellent companions for active families looking for a hiking dog or a running dog (always on a leash), and they're quiet, calm companions at home--some would even say they're couch potatoes who like to snuggle up and put their heads in your lap.

 Oven-roasted veal in the traditional French style. VNS Photos Mathilde Tuyết Trần Mathilde Tuyết Trần* Winter is the season of hot dishes to help fight the cold weather and hot ovens exuding warmth and the fulfilling fragrance of food around the house, showing signs of a happy family. The simplicity of a family is having food on the table, under one loving roof with loved ones around. Only when you lose these things do you know how having them is endless happiness. It's getting colder in the suburbs of Paris where we live, though we turned on our heater in September. But on Monday, we ventured out grocery shopping for this very traditional French roast. In France, like in many countries, there are both supermarkets and open-air markets. The open-air markets, usually open on fixed days, are where local farmers sell their poultry, veggies, fruits and eggs. Their produce may not be as easy on the eye as those sold in the supermarkets, but they are closer to nature. Prices at farmers' markets can be a little higher than in supermarkets, but many shop there just to have a chat with the sellers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government issued two terms of social distancing and a curfew, that lasted… Read full this story

But concerns remain that London will be moved from Tier 2 to Tier 3 are slowly building, a move that the Mayor described as "catastrophic."
 Pubs, bars, hotels, restaurants and entertainment venues would be forced to close (except for takeaway) if London were to be go into the toughest tier. Household mixing would also be completely banned, until Christmas bubbles are permitted to form in time on December 23.
 Public Health Regional Director for London Kevin Fenton has urged Londoners to consider the risks in the build up to Christmas.
 "Covid-19 behaves like clockwork," he said, "the more contact we have with others, the higher chance of catching or spreading the virus.
 "We'll need to work together to prevent a big surge in cases in London ahead of the festive period so we must all do our bit and limit the spread over the coming days and weeks."
 The Government will review the tiers in each area, before making an announcement on Thursday, December 17.

Australian shepherd colors and patterns can vary greatly, but the United States Australian Shepherd Association recognizes these four major categories: black, red, red merle, and blue merle (merle being the genetic pattern that occurs in a dog's coat, often appearing as speckled patches of color). Red merle Australian shepherd dogs have shades of red (sometimes known as liver) that appear in their coats as colored patches against a white or tan base that darkens with age. Both solid red and red merle Aussies tend to have red lips, noses, and eye rims. Blue merle Aussies have black spots against a gray base that also darken with age. Both black and blue merle Australian shepherds usually have black noses, lips, and eye rims.
