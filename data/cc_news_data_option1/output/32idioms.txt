He hit his $800,000 target and stayed in the race but still did not make the cut for that debate.

The Israeli prime minister was pushing on with what Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the ‘’peace of the brave,’’ based on the 1993 Oslo peace accords. Two years after the groundbreaking handshake on the White House lawn between the two men, Rabin was killed by an Israeli extremist opposed to peace negotiations with the Palestinians at a rally promoting the accords. Successive right-wing Israeli governments, which prolonged the occupation, and a weakened Palestinian leadership have overseen a process that was moribund and now effectively dead in the water after a series of moves by President Donald Trump have been widely perceived as favoring Israel and punishing the Palestinians.

Inflation expectations, some argue, can become self-fulfilling: If workers expect low inflation, they’re less likely to demand higher pay, which, in turn, allows companies to keep a lid on prices.
 Low inflation expectations are another reason for the Fed to keep rates down, in hopes that they will eventually boost inflation.
 In comments since the December meeting, Fed officials have remained upbeat about the economy’s prospects.

“For some time, we have tried to establish meaningful intergovernmental engagement regarding our gaming compacts, but you have continued to reject our compacts' plain terms," Cherokee Nation Chief Chuck Hoskin, Chickasaw Nation Gov. Bill Anoatubby and Choctaw Nation Chief Gary Batton wrote in a joint letter to Stitt on Tuesday. “Recently, you have gone further, stating allegations against us and threats to our operations.”
 Oklahoma’s new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt contends the gaming compacts expire on Jan. 1 and that casino gambling after that date will be illegal. Stitt has signaled he wants to renegotiate the compacts to give the state a larger slice of revenue. An attempt by Stitt earlier in December to offer an extension of the compacts while negotiations continued was rejected by most of the tribes.
 Stitt announced Tuesday that two of the 39 federally recognized tribes in the state — the Kialegee Tribal Town and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians — agreed to an eight-month extension of the compacts.
 “The state of Oklahoma offered an extension, with no strings attached, to all tribes that operate casinos in the state, and my door continues to be open for more tribes to join who are worried about impending uncertainty,” Stitt said in a statement.
 Stitt added that he was disappointed that most of the other tribes in the state rejected his previous offers for arbitration or a temporary extension.
 The dispute between the governor and the tribes has grown contentious since Stitt first signaled in an op-ed this summer that he wanted to renegotiate the compacts. Last week, Stitt’s top adviser on tribal issues, Lisa Billy, resigned and accused the governor of creating an “unnecessary conflict” with the tribes.
 Tribal officials have signaled they are open to renegotiating the rates of the compacts, but not until the governor acknowledges that the compacts renew on Jan. 1. Stitt has not conceded that point and maintains the compacts expire.
 Under the existing compacts, approved by Oklahoma voters in 2004, tribes pay the state “exclusivity fees" between 4% and 10% on gambling revenue in exchange for the exclusive right to operate casinos. Those fees generated nearly $139 million for the state in the 2018 fiscal year, most of it earmarked for education, on roughly $2.3 billion in revenue from games covered under the compacts.
 Since the compacts were approved, casino gambling has exploded in Oklahoma with more than 130 casinos dotting the state, ranging from gas station annexes to resort-style casinos, many of them in border communities. The Winstar World Casino in a rural part of the state’s Red River border with Texas includes massive hotel towers, more than a dozen restaurants and a 400,000-square-foot (37,161- square-meter-) casino floor billed as the largest in the world. Tour buses filled with gamblers from neighboring Texas routinely shuttle into the casino’s parking lot, which is also packed with cars sporting Texas license plates.

What I do like is how Paul Cook has got the players passing the ball again instead of lumping a long ball up to a striker. We look a lot better on the ball and have been dominating possession in games. While possession doesn't guarantee goals or wins, it does help us control games and gives us a better chance to create opportunities, score goals and win games. Having said that, I don't think the attacking players have offered much quality in the past few matches. Josh Windass played very well at Birmingham, but I don't think he's an out and out striker, and I would rather see Joe Garner play up front, with Windass on the left or behind Garner. Hopefully his goal will give him the confidence to kick on and add to his tally in the next few games. I'd like to see more from Jamal Lowe given the money paid for him over the summer and it would be good to see Michael Jacobs and Gavin Massey get on the scoresheet and create more chances in games as well. Failing to do so must surely mean Anthony Pilkington, Joe Gelhardt and Gary Roberts will have a chance to start games in the near future. The Leicester game gives us a chance to forget about the league and test ourselves against top-quality opposition before Bristol City at home next week. To have back to back league wins, something we've not done since April last year, would be huge and hopefully we can start to climb away from the relegation zone.

Welcome to 2020, a year in which Wigan Athletic win away games! Well, away game actually, and only time will tell whether New Year's Day was an upward blip or just rewards for a series of improving performances. As starts to a New Year go, it's not a bad one! This might have been a very different column it it hadn't. In terms of how December went, we played six games, lost two and drew four. How many of those could/should we have won? Quite possibly, all of them based on performances. However, performances aren't what is going to keep us in this division, points are. Let's make no bones about it, the continued inability to collect three of them planted us firmly at the bottom of the table on Xmas Day. Yes I agree that points matter, and that you can't argue with them. Beyond that, the key indicator is performance and aside from the games against Brentford, Reading and Preston this season, we have been in every single game. I'll stop short of using that appalling term 'fine margins' but I do like to look at the patterns of performances as well as the patterns of results. We were desperately unlucky in every single game last month, snatching draws and even defeats from the jaws of victory. This pattern of not seeing out games and our away record in general, went on far too long to be considered unlucky, so I completely understand so many fans have been calling for the removal of the manager from his post. However, in order to resolve those results and performances and the way games have played out, there were only ever going to be two ways out of it:

By Jonnelle Marte and Jason Lange
 BALTIMORE/WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Top U.S. Federal Reserve officials struck upbeat tones about the economy on Friday, a confidence reflected in a record of their latest meeting that signaled no urgency to offer additional stimulus in the wake of three interest rate cuts last year.
 In a blitz of appearances to kick off the new year, the heads of several regional Fed banks pointed to a strong job market, robust consumer spending and optimism for a resolution to the trade tensions that had nicked growth in the second half of 2019.
 But they also noted the longest U.S. expansion on record could still fall victim to outside shocks, such as this week's dramatic escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran.
 "The economy is still healthy. I'm encouraged by recent jobs reports and the pace of holiday spending," with last year's round of three Fed rate cuts helping prop up demand for homes, cars and other big-ticket consumer items, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said.
 That assessment was shared by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. In a CNBC interview, Evans predicted U.S. economic growth this year would chug along at a rate of 2% to 2.25%, roughly the pace of expansion in the second half of last year.
 The heads of the Cleveland and Dallas Fed banks sounded equally sanguine about the outlook. Together, their comments are the latest indication that Fed policymakers are uniformly satisfied the three rate cuts they delivered in 2019 should provide a sufficient buffer against the clutch of risks that spurred them into providing stimulus.
 Indeed, after a fractious year for the Fed, which saw split votes on each of the rate cuts, officials agreed unanimously in their final policy meeting of 2019 to leave rates unchanged. Moreover, they agreed rates were likely to stay on hold for "a time" as long as the economy remains on track, minutes of the Dec. 10-11 meeting released on Friday showed.
 "Participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate," according to the minutes.
 The December meeting signaled an end to a mini-easing cycle beginning in July that brought the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate down by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.50-1.75%. Policymaker projections released at that meeting forecast no change to the rate this year.
 HEART ATTACK?
 But on a day when global oil prices spiked and stock markets fell after a U.S. air strike in Iraq that killed a top Iranian military figure, Barkin for one noted that recent recessions have been triggered by unexpected shocks - an economic "heart attack" as he termed it - that came amid the same sort of continued growth and low unemployment the United States is experiencing now.
 "There´s always the possibility of a 'heart attack,' or shock, perhaps caused by global risks. Given yesterday's news, imagine an escalation with Iran or, separately, a collapse in international economies," Barkin said in a speech to the Maryland Bankers Association in Baltimore.
 Highlighting those risks, oil prices shot 3% higher on the Iran developments, although the diminishing reliance on imported oil thanks to the U.S. shale boom means the potential hit to the economy is more limited than in the past, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said.
 "These events in the Middle East will have an effect but it's going to be more muted than we might have seen historically," Kaplan said in an interview with CNBC.
 The Fed through much of last year noted that uncertainty around global trade policy and events like Britain's pending departure from the European Union were holding down business investment and posed perhaps the key risk to the U.S. recovery.
 Indeed, a key manufacturing sector survey out on Friday showed U.S. factory activity contracted by the most in more than a decade last month, although the recent Phase 1 trade deal between the United States and China may help limit further downside.
 Barkin, too, said he was "hopeful" about recent progress in U.S.-China trade talks and signs that Brexit may pass without a major economic disruption.
 "Recession isn't inevitable" absent some shock, he said, "along many dimensions the economy looks quite healthy."
 Still, risks remain, with companies yet to have a fully clear idea about the global trade environment that is emerging.
 "Add political polarization and regulatory uncertainty to the mix and it´s tough for businesses to feel like they´re on solid ground ... I don´t discount the idea that we could talk ourselves into a recession, particularly if the uncertainty begins to affect consumer confidence and spending," Barkin said. "In my view, the biggest boost to our economy would come from lessening the uncertainty and lowering the volume."

On to Birmingham, and thanks to Virgin I missed the first half. No, nowt to do with the trains, my WIFI was down, but I was reliably told by mainly drunks and cads on Twitter that Windass' first goal is already goal of the decade. Obviously they equalise before half time, like anyone didn't think they would, and I up sticks to Mother Caddy's for the second half. I give Windass a lot of stick, mostly justified, but he was outstanding on the day, chased every ball and got his reward with his second goal. The Tics are in dreamland and, when a few mins later Cedric Kipre pokes the ball home with some part of his body, surely this is the day? Birmingham duly score and people are lumping on them for the win, we all know the drill, we all know what'll inevitably happen, we all know we'll get a draw at best, the clock hits 90 minutes and '5' is held up...no Tics fan has any nails left, even the toe nails are gone! But we hang on and the final whistle brings MASSIVE relief on all at the club, from the top down, the monkey is finally off our backs and we can move on 'hopefully'. This weekend brings the FA Cup back to our door, and the underdogs will be trying to cause an upset and beat us, this time it's Leicester, we'll save Manchester City for later in the comp. They're flying in the Premier League and we're both unbeaten this year so far, it's only £10 a ticket, so come on lads and ladies, let's get down there and start the road to our inevitable cup win in May with a decent following. Right I'm off for a 'Bow...UP THE TICS!

The Bucks love to play fast and free, but those conference finals were combat in the mud, played at a 96.8 pace with Middleton on the court. Slowing the Bucks down is much easier said than done — there’s no _shutting down_ someone like Antetokounmpo, and Milwaukee’s supplementary pieces work in beautiful concert even when they don’t have a go-to scorer on the floor — but Middleton’s shot making against teams that force them to operate in the half- court will be even more critical than it was last year, when Malcolm Brogdon’s frontcourt touches were higher despite averaging six fewer minutes in the conference finals.

Again, time will tell but it seems to me that whichever way you look at it, there were only two aspects to our game which needed to be addressed. Firstly, stop conceding late goals and, secondly, try and score some more goals. Dead easy. Needless to say, I am an advocate of option 2, but I reached a point where I wouldn't have been distraught if Option 1 had been exercised. Mainly because, even though I see positive performances and we are certainly trying to win games, we just haven't had the composure to see them out. Also, Cook hasn't exactly helped himself with some of his team selections, least of all the continued omission of young Joe Gelhardt. Me, I'd keep him under wraps till February 1 personally and then unleash him, purely to stop any cheeky chancers trying to bid for him in January. But I understand why people want to see him: if you've got a raw, exciting footballer like that, why not use him? Let us dearly hope that is the last we will hear of the above debate around the manager this year, though I'm not holding my breath. The bottom line is, regardless of where you stand on the club and its management, we just all want to see us win a few more football matches. I'm not the slightest bit bothered about how the cup game at Leicester goes, it is simply a free hit. And we'll probably be the ones getting punched in the face. If we can just continue in the same vein in the league as we are and pick up a couple more wins, then the Wigan Athletic world will become a brighter place all of a sudden.

How much of the sky can you see at any one time? This, of course, assumes you are looking up from a wide-open, flat field or out on an ocean liner with nothing but a flat horizon no matter which way you look.      The entire sky includes every direction you can look from any point on the Earth's globe. The total sky is referred to by astronomers as the celestial sphere. Thousands of years ago, the assumption was that the stars were points of light on a great overhead dome, seen from inside. It does look that way.      One may think the amount of this inverted sphere that you could see from a flat field is one half. That's only true if you are positioned at the very north or south pole, or from the equator.      From the poles, however, all you ever see is the same half of the celestial sphere. From the equator, as the year goes along, you can see the entire celestial sphere, but only one half at any one time.      The Earth's equator is directly under its counterpart on the celestial sphere, the celestial equator. The north and south poles, which mark the axis of the turning Earth, points directly to the north celestial pole (NCP) and south celestial pole, respectively. (The North Star is very close to the NCP.)      If you have an opportunity to travel a few hundred miles north or south, you can easily notice how the sky changes. I've made a few trips to Florida, and have always been fascinated to see how far down in the sky the North Star appears, as compared to my view in Pennsylvania.      The measure of the North Star above the northern horizon in degrees gives you your approximate latitude. From home, my latitude is almost 41 degrees 30 minutes. From mid-Florida, where we have relatives, the latitude is just shy of 27 degrees. The entire sky shifts approximately 14.5 degrees every time I travel to Florida.      The whole celestial sphere is measured in degrees. All the way around the entire sky is 360 degrees, a complete circle. The NCP is at (+) 90 degrees; the celestial equator is at 0 degrees. Latitude has its counterpart on the celestial sphere; it is referred to as "declination." Longitude on the sky is referred to as "right ascension."      From where I live, I cannot see any stars below 48 degrees south of the celestial equator.      There is an entire portion of the starry heavens awaiting me, from (-) 48 degrees to the south celestial pole (SCP) which is at (-)180 degrees.      It's an incredible experience if you are familiar with the constellations, to see how they shift. The farther south I travel, the more stars are visible in the far south, which never break the horizon from home.      From Florida around Christmas time, in early evening, I am fascinated at the fact that the Big Dipper partly dips below the northern horizon, which never happens in Pennsylvania. The marvelous constellation Orion is rising in the east, but from Florida what an odd angle it makes!      FYI: The celestial equator, by the way, passes right through Orion's three- star "belt." From the ice at the north pole, during the 24-hours of night, you would see the top of Orion slowly moving around the horizon as the Earth spins.      From Florida on an early winter evening, I am amazed to see in the far southern sky the beautiful, bright star Canopus, far below Orion's stars and the bright star Sirius. Canopus is invisible from Pennsylvania. At certain times from Florida, I have glimpsed the bright star Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to the sun. Alpha Centauri is very low in the southern sky from mid-Florida; it is better to travel even farther south to see it.      A whole new sky unfolds the more you head south. Perhaps you have had a chance to see the stars from the Southern Hemisphere; I have not had that chance. You can trace the Southern Cross and many more constellations never seen far north. Constellations you are familiar with seeing are upside down when viewed from below the equator. The moon even flips on its head!      Traveling north and south, you witness that the Earth is indeed round like a ball, and you can better appreciate the vast wonder of the stars all the way around.      Full moon is on Jan. 10.      Keep looking up!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

"I grew a lot mentally over the year and I did make a step forward in that department. I'd never really experienced failure to that level and going through that, I think it's going to help me big time going into this year."
 Shaw batted just .157 with a .281 on-base percentage and .270 slugging over 86 games for the Milwaukee Brewers last season, his worst in four years in the majors.
 The 29-year-old infielder had a career-high 32 home runs the year before while batting .241, and hit .273 with 31 homers and 101 runs batted in in his first year with Milwaukee in 2017.
 Shaw attributed his steep dip in production to a minor adjustment he made to his swing heading into the 2019 season. And while he said he was starting to feel back to his usual self by the end of the year, he didn't get a chance to prove that sitting on the bench as the Brewers made their playoff push.
 "It didn't work out obviously, it kinda backfired on me," Shaw said of the swing adjustment. "I fought my body and I fought myself all year trying to get back to where I was the two years prior to that."
 After "resetting" his mind at the start of this off-season, Shaw said he feels ready to jump into 2020. And he's already had multiple conversations with Toronto hitting coach Guillermo Martinez, making sure he and the Blue Jays are on the same page with his pre-spring training work schedule.
 Shaw, who began his major league career in the American League East with the Boston Red Sox — he made his MLB debut against the Blue Jays in Toronto in May 2015 — is embracing his second chance in the AL after three seasons in the National League.
 He batted .251 with 29 homers, 44 doubles and 107 RBI's over two seasons (210 games) with Boston. And he's had success in the AL East's hitter-friendly parks, including going 14-for-53 through 15 career games at Rogers Centre.
 "The AL East is kinda the big boy division ... they've had that reputation since I started following baseball at a young age," Shaw said. "And obviously when you play against the Red Sox and Yankees, those series are always fun. But for me it's the familiarity with the league, the travel and everything that helps, that's nothing new for me.
 "I've played in both leagues now, I've played in every stadium in my big league career so nothing's really going to sneak up on me this year."
 Shaw will mostly slot in at first base this season and play third when Vladimir Guerrero Jr., gets a day off. He also has experience at second base.

"I'm excited to be named to the AHL All-Star Classic and to represent the Binghamton Devils," said Street. "It's always an honor when your efforts are rewarded, but, I have been helped along immensely by my coaches and teammates."
 After capturing an NCAA Championship at University of Wisconsin in 2005-06, Street worked his way up through the ECHL and was selected to the 2011 All- Star Game and earned Rookie of the Year honors with the Wheeling Nailers. Street helped lead Grand Rapids to a Calder Cup Championship in the 2016-17 season where he tallied 55 points in 62 regular-season games and added 21 points in 19 playoff games.
 "He's a really good hockey player and a better person," said head coach Mark Dennehy. "He's off to a really good start here for us and couldn't be happier for him. Ben is a leader and he does things the right way both on and off the ice. Whether it's in the weight room, on the ice, or in the community, he does things the right way."
 The Devils are back home Friday night against the Bridgeport Sound Tigers at 7:05 p.m. College students can get a $10 ticket and your choice of a FREE slider or drink at Craft after the game! Also, there will be another FREE postgame skate with the Devils players! Tickets are available by calling or texting "TICKETS" to 607-722-7367.
