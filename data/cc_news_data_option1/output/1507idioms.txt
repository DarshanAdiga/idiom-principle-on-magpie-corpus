The host nation will enter Saturday's clash as favourites but will be wary of underestimating Chile, who impressed when qualifying from Group B as runners- up.
 Brazil's progression was relatively straightforward, with wins over Croatia and Cameroon meaning a goalless draw against Mexico did not prevent them from claiming top spot in Group A.
 They scored seven goals in the process, with Neymar netting four in an ominous sign for Chile.
 Brazil have appeared suspect in defence at times, but the brilliance of the Barcelona forward means they are always likely to carry a significant goal threat.
 And striker Fred – who notched his first goal of the showpiece in a 4-1 triumph over Cameroon on Monday – is hopeful his team can make the most of a relative lack of height in a Chile defence set to feature the likes of Gary Medel and Gonzalo Jara.
 "I've talked to our full-backs, our wingers," Fred told reporters.
 "They (the Chileans) are short. With our height, free kicks could be a good weapon for us.
 "The great quality of Chile is their tactical skill. And they have players up front who can make a difference.
 "From what they've been showing in the cup, they're going to try to attack Brazil too."
 Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari will hope David Luiz – who stands 1.89m tall – is fit after he reportedly hurt his back in training.
 Chile finished second in their pool after they followed a 3-1 win over Australia with an excellent 2-0 triumph against Spain – a result that eliminated the defending world champions.
 They were made to look vulnerable in the air by Australia's Tim Cahill, something that is sure to give Fred encouragement, but have excited going forward with the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Charles Aranguiz impressing.
 Star man Arturo Vidal had knee surgery in the build-up to the World Cup and was rested for a 2-0 defeat to the Netherlands with a place in the knockout stages already sealed.
 He is expected to walk straight back into Chile's starting line-up as coach Jorge Sampaoli looks to guide the nation to the last eight for the first time since they hosted the tournament in 1962.
 On that occasion, Chile were eliminated in the semi-finals by Brazil, but Alexis does not believe a similar result is on the cards.
 "We have respect for them but I think we are going to beat them," he said.
 "We came to this World Cup to make history. We beat the world champions and, although we had a slip-up against Holland, we are going out to try and win the cup."

Each day, the routine went something like this: Sandi would train in the morning while her father, Harry, worked from home as a geologist. When their day jobs were complete, they headed to the field -- about two blocks out their front door -- to finish the pole-vault project (friends volunteered their time, too, on property the owner gave a green light to use). The father and daughter would be down there until nearly dark. Most times, she would head home first with her dad saying he would be along shortly.

Secrets can be nearly impossible to contain, and such is the case with Hidden Pond Resort. After my visit to this secluded spot, tucked into a 60-acre pocket of Kennebunkport on the southern coast of Maine, wild horses couldn't keep me from dishing about my discovery.      Sure, I was already familiar with walkable downtown Kennebunkport. Its greenways and charming streets hold a special place in my heart. It feels like time travel to a town where people still stroll, couples walk hand in hand, and everyone greets each other.      I was shocked when my sister, Cheryl, who resides less than two hours south, confessed she'd never been there. In an instant, the idea to celebrate her upcoming birthday at Kennebunkport's much-acclaimed Hidden Pond was hatched.      Check-in at Hidden Pond takes place in a building nestled in the depths of a birch tree forest that was part of an old estate. Here, we were given a map of the property and pointed to the road where we'd find our accommodations, aptly named The Stargazer. We were impressed with this bi-level, two-bedroom, three bath cottage -- and even more impressed by its interior, with its screened porch, full kitchen and dining room, fireplaced living room and outdoor shower.      The bedrooms were equally luxurious, no quibbling necessary. We left our luggage in our respective rooms and headed back out to locate The Tree Spa, where pre-scheduled aromatherapy massages were calling our names. The surrounding beauty of nature distracted us from following our map, however, and we walked straight past Earth, Hidden Pond's critically raved-about restaurant. Once we backtracked our steps, we stopped inside the restaurant for direction. Inside, we admired its eclectic decor, and outside, the saltwater pool was inviting, and right behind the pool, voila ­-- the Tree Spa. Ensconced in treehouse-style massage rooms, we inhaled both the aroma of the pine trees outside and the lavender oil being expertly rubbed onto our skin.      Afterward, relaxed and rubbery, we called one of Hidden Pond's complimentary shuttles, with the goal of hitting happy hour at Hidden Pond's sister property, The Tides Beach Club.      The club's unobstructed view of Goose Rocks Beach and the crash of waves against the rocks mesmerized us as we sipped on a pair of watermelon Cosmos. Could it get any better? Why yes, it could, I realized as I tucked into a best-of-my-life Maine lobster roll, paired perfectly with a glass (or two) of chilled Chablis. The club's bar scene was lively, and we met a few patrons who said they'd returned to Hidden Pond twice, thrice or four times. This was not all that surprising.      Energized and not quite ready for the night to end, we stopped by the resort's communal firepit and indulged in s'mores, with all the luxury makin's ready for use, courtesy of Earth restaurant.      My sister is an early bird, and by the time I wandered downstairs from my blissful night's sleep, she had already dug into the coffee and pastries conveniently left on our doorstep. This was a "light" breakfast, but a heartier version is available at Earth.      We had a game plan for Cheryl's birthday and were soon on the road to Ricker Hill Orchards, a ninth-generation family farm about 60 minutes inland, to pick organic apples. Apple picking made us hungry, so we fueled up at Terry & Maxine's in the town of Turner. Their turkey and Swiss Rachel sandwich hit the proverbial spot.      Next stop, downtown Kennebunkport. As I'd hoped would happen, Cheryl was enchanted by the town and its unique shops, eateries and art galleries lining the charming streets.      Back at Hidden Pond, we headed to its garden shed, where we were encouraged to grab a vase and clip an arrangement of local wildflowers to grace the table at our cottage.      As the climax to this birthday weekend, I had arranged dinner for us at Earth. Our farm-to-fork meal featured an innovative menu created by Hidden Pond's Executive Chef Joe Schafer. It incorporated vegetables and herbs picked from Earth's on-site organic farm, freshly caught seafood and meats sourced from local purveyors.      No late-night s'mores for us this evening; we simply rolled back to The Stargazer cottage, flicked a switch, and chilled out by the gas fireplace for a while. We checked out the following morning, begrudgingly, as we longed to stay forever, hidden in the fold of Hidden Pond. Alas, it was time to return to real life.

The Group D rivals meet in Manaus just short of two years since they last met competitively at UEFA Euro 2012, when Italy won on penalties in the last eight before reaching the final.
 A number of players who featured in Kiev will again lock horns as the respective nations look to gain early momentum as they seek to reach the knockout stages.
 With a dangerous Uruguay side taking on Costa Rica earlier in the day, defeat for either England or Italy could prove costly.
 There has been something of a change of personnel for both nations, with England perhaps shading it in terms of new faces and systems.
 Forced to rely on a defensive, counter-attacking approach early in Roy Hodgson's reign, the England manager now has a number of exciting young talents at his disposal.
 Raheem Sterling and Adam Lallana look set to gain starting spots behind Daniel Sturridge, while Ross Barkley is also in contention to feature.
 A new-look back line including Leighton Baines, Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka will be tasked with keeping the likes of Mario Balotelli quiet.
 Wayne Rooney is one of few players who remain from the starting XI from two years ago, with the Manchester United forward hoping to finally show his potential when it matters on the international stage.
 "I feel better than I have done for years and I am ready for this tournament. I know that if I can play my game then I can do well," he said.
 "(Previously) I have gone into tournaments with little niggles or some different things. But here I haven't missed a session."
 Cesare Prandelli also has new attacking options to call on, with Lorenzo Insigne, Ciro Immobile and Alessio Cerci all set to feature in their first major tournament for Italy.
 Recently-confirmed Borussia Dortmund signing Immobile is vying for a starting spot with Balotelli in Prandelli's forward line and struck a hat-trick in Sunday's friendly against Fluminense.
 Last season's top goalscorer in Serie A, Immobile is among the younger members of the side, but the likes of Andrea Pirlo, Andrea Barzagli and Antonio Cassano will all offer much-needed experience in Brazil.
 Pirlo, in particular, was England's tormentor-in-chief in Kiev and he believes form is with the Italians going into their opener.
 "We know England are a great team who have improved a lot with new, young players coming in," he said this week.
 "They have good runners but we know how to face them and have been studying England over the last few days.
 "Italy have always had great games against England as we have a different approach to the sport, so we'll give our all in our own style."
 England have injury worries over Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, while Mattia De Sciglio has been ruled out due to a thigh strain.

Ola will offer its technology platform and capabilities to Government and Public Service Organisations free of cost in light of the Covid-19 crisis.
 Government and public service organizations will be able to use the Ola CONNECTS (COmprehensive Navigation, NEtworking, Control and Tracking Solution) platform to build custom technology solutions to combat Covid-19. The platform’s Navigation and Real-time tracking, Geo-fencing Control, Real-time Alert System and AI-enabled Selfie Authentication capabilities will help the government create solutions for contact tracing, crowd control and monitoring.
 “Ola CONNECTS can be replicated across various use cases including Emergency and Healthcare Support, Supply Chain Management, Law Enforcement, Frontline Resource Deployment, Incident and Information Response, and War-Room Management, amongst others,” the company said in an official statement on Thursday.
 Pranay Jivrajka, Co-Founder, Ola said, “By opening up Ola CONNECTS to various state governments and public service organisations, we are able to offer a ready to deploy technology solution that addresses unique challenges in the various relief initiatives that are underway. All of Ola’s innovations across AI, tracking technologies, allocation and flow management are part of the CONNECTS platform. ”
 The digital cab-hailing service recently collaborated with the Punjab government to provide tracking technology to manage the agricultural supply chain. The platform is a medium for authorities to effectively track and manage over 17 lakh farmers’ produce and their vehicle movement into mandis across the state, while following social distancing norms.
 “Ola CONNECTS has a centralised dashboard, which can track the movement of farmers along with their vehicles in and around mandis, enabling officials to manage the flow of farmers when collecting their produce, to prevent crowding,” it said.
 Ola CONNECTS said it is following all necessary protocols as directed by law and the company’s own privacy policy in its handling of personal and confidential information.

The nations won their respective opening matches on Saturday and another victory for either would all but secure their place in the knockout stages.
 In a group where all four sides will have had high expectations of qualification when the tournament began, Colombia and Ivory Coast struck first as they triumphed over Greece and Japan respectively.
 Jose Pekerman's team were in particularly impressive form as they swept aside the Greeks 3-0 while Sabri Lamouchi's men came from behind to beat Japan 2-1.
 Ivory Coast started slowly in their opening clash and a repeat could cost them against a Colombia side who were ahead inside six minutes in their first game.
 The return of Fredy Guarin following suspension will further bolster Colombia's attacking options and Jackson Martinez, who came off the bench against Greece, expects a tougher test than in their opener.
 "Ivory Coast is a team who have grown a lot, they have a lot of experience," Martinez said.
 "The match against Japan was a showcase of them being a team. You have to keep controlling the game until the end."
 Dider Drogba was at his influential best against Japan - helping to inspire his side's recovery from a goal down after being introduced from the bench.
 Lamouchi has hinted Drogba will likely begin Thursday's game on the bench again and the 36-year-old striker is content with a bit part role.
 Regardless of whether he is handed a starting berth or not, Martinez still anticipates that the Galatasaray man will be a prominent figure for his country.
 "We all know his quality, he's a big forward and he's done a lot of things in his career," the Porto striker added.
 "He's a leader on the pitch and can lead his team to victory when things get complicated.
 "He's a key player for the Ivory Coast either starting or coming off the bench."
 It will be the first meeting between the two nations and the victor can take a huge stride towards wrapping up a last-16 berth, with Japan and Greece hoping to make up ground on the losers, or on both sides if the spoils are shared.
 Between them, Colombia and Ivory Coast have reached the knockout stages at the World Cup just once previously but that looks set to change ahead of what promises to be an exciting, attacking affair.
 Even without the injured Radamel Falcao and Carlos Bacca, the likes of Martinez, Adrian Ramos and Teofilo Gutierrez can threaten goals for Colombia while Wilfried Bony and Gervinho will hope to add their World Cup goal tallies for the Africans.

American singer-songwriter Carrie Underwood gave her followers a glimpse into a typical morning at home while her family is practising social distancing. The 37-year-old country icon shared a sweet photo on Instagram of husband Mike Fisher, playing aeroplane with their two boys - 14-month-old Jaco and 5-year- old Isaiah, holding up Jacob in one palm and Isaiah in the other.
 Having fun with the activity, Isaiah kept his arms out to the side pretending to be an aeroplane while baby Jacob looked directly at his dad who was laying on the floor. Taking to the caption Underwood wrote, "Mornings at the Fisher house."
 The 'Love Wins' singer and the former hockey player, over the past few weeks, have both been vocal in urging people to stay home to stop the COVID-19 spread. On Tuesday, the 'Good Girl' songstress participated in the #IStayHomeFor social media challenge, sharing that her reason to stay home is for "my boys."
 The couple, on April 1, shared a video on Instagram urging fans to follow coronavirus safety protocol. "To help the health of our community, we're asking everyone to stay at home as much as possible and practice social distancing. That's right, working together we can stop the spread of COVID-19. "Do your part, stay apart," the couple jointly said before Fisher concluded the video with, "God bless you guys."
 The singer who has been practising social distancing with her family is also keeping her followers updated with recipes she's tried at home, workout videos with her husband and more. Last week, Carrie also joined 'ACM Presents: Our Country' where she performed her song 'Drinking Alone.' The special was put on by the Academy of Country Music in place of the ACM Awards, which have been postponed until September due to COVID-19 outbreak. (ANI)

Big things were expected of Marc Wilmots' side ahead of the tournament, but they made hard work of getting off to a winning start against Algeria.
 Substitutes Marouane Fellaini and Dries Mertens were on target in the last 20 minutes to thwart an Algeria side that looked set to pull off a shock victory after Sofiane Feghouli put them ahead with a first-half penalty.
 Belgium had failed to demonstrate the attacking flair that has led to talk of them being dark horses to win the tournament in Brazil.
 They dug deep to secure all three points, though, and another victory against Fabio Capello's side - who laboured to a 1-1 draw with South Korea in their opener - at the Maracana will see them through with a game to spare.
 Wilmots is optimistic that captain Vincent Kompany will be fit for the Russia match after he sustained a groin problem against Algeria.
 The Manchester City skipper was able to finish the game, but revealed he had suffered a twinge late on and Thomas Vermaelen, Laurent Ciman and Nicolas Lombaerts will be vying to replace him if he is deemed unfit.
 Eden Hazard will get another opportunity to demonstrate why he is held in such regard after it was revealed that a bruised toe will not keep him out of Sunday's clash.
 Midfielder Fellaini and winger Mertens could be rewarded for the impact they made with a place in the starting line-up.
 Capello, meanwhile, will be demanding an improvement from his Russia side after they had to come from behind to salvage a point against South Korea.
 Aleksandr Kerzhakov spared goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev's blushes by equalising 16 minutes from time at Arena Pantanal on Tuesday.
 Akinfeev had inexplicably allowed Lee Keun-Ho's speculative strike to slip through his hands and into the net, but Kerzhakov became his country's joint- leading scorer with a close-range strike just six minutes later.
 Kerzhakov, who moved level with Vladimir Beschastnykh on 26 goals for Russia, will be hoping to get a chance from the start as he attempts to become the nation's outright all-time leading marksman.
 Midfielder Alan Dzagoev could also be promoted to the starting XI on the back of an impressive display after coming on just before the hour in Russia's opener.
 Victory for Russia could see them move to the top of Group H with Algeria to come in their final pool match.
 Belgium, playing in their first major tournament since the 2002 World Cup, beat Russia in the last meeting between the two nations back in 2010 courtesy of a double from Romelu Lukaku.

 Steve Bruce was reportedly keen for the 28-year-old to remain at the KC Stadium, but Fryatt decided to move on after finding himself behind Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long in the pecking order.
 Fryatt started his career at Walsall before moving to Leicester City in January 2006, and his 32 goals in the 2008-09 season helped the club achieve promotion from League One.
 Having impressed at the Midlands club, he signed for Hull where he was reunited with Nigel Pearson who had been his manager at Leicester, and he became a fans' favourite with 16 goals in his debut campaign on Humberside.
 However, a serious Achilles injury hampered his progress, and he was sent on loan to Sheffield Wednesday last season where he scored four goals in just seven starts for the Championship team.
 Fryatt now links up with new Forest manager Stuart Pearce, who is attempting to build a squad capable of reaching the Premier League.

Now, her coach can simply send along a workout.
 “This virus kind of pushed us to do something that we’ve always wanted to do,” said Morris, who finished second to Katerina Stefanidi of Greece at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
 The entire endeavor took about three weeks and cost around $4,000 (not counting the landing mat, which usually runs around $30,000 but was loaned to her). There's a rubber surface covering the runway for better traction, too. No concrete was used so it can be moved (although, not easily).
 Each day, the routine went something like this: Sandi would train in the morning while her father, Harry, worked from home as a geologist. When their day jobs were complete, they headed to the field — about two blocks out their front door — to finish the pole-vault project (friends volunteered their time, too, on property the owner gave a green light to use). The father and daughter would be down there until nearly dark. Most times, she would head home first with her dad saying he would be along shortly.
 “An hour later, he then comes home. My mom’s like, ‘Where were you?’ And he’s like, and this is always the answer, ‘Oh, I was just tinkering,’” explained Morris, who's earned the silver medal at the last two world outdoor championships. “This project brings him a lot of joy — and that brings me a lot of joy.”
 The blueprint was provided by Scott Kendricks, the father of two-time world pole vaulting champion Sam Kendricks. The Kendricks family built a similar setup years ago in Mississippi (they've since switched to a fabricated runway).
 It's no easy task.
 “Almost like building a skate-park — you can really mess it up if you don’t know what you’re doing,” Sam Kendricks said. “But I saw her running on it and I was like, ‘Wow, that’s a fine runway you guys have built.’”

The 1998 world champions had been considered among the favourites in South Africa in 2010, but France endured a dismal campaign, claiming just one point and finishing bottom of their group in a tournament that was marred by off- field tensions in the camp.
 France's squad is much-changed from the one that failed so spectacularly and are largely expected to progress as Group E winners under Didier Deschamps.
 The abysmal 2010 campaign featured slip-ups against Mexico and hosts South Africa, meaning that France will be wary of avoiding another shock against a Honduras side viewed as outsiders in the group.
 And, with Franck Ribery – star of a relatively impressive qualifying campaign – out of the tournament with a back injury, there is reason for Honduras to be confident of earning a maiden World Cup win in what is the first meeting between the two sides.
 Filling the void left by Ribery will be Deschamps' main concern heading into the clash at Estadio Beira-Rio in Porto Alegre, although the former Marseille coach has already asserted that he "knows his best line-up" for the encounter.
 Whether that line-up includes Karim Benzema or Antoine Griezmann remains to be seen, but both should be in contention to take Ribery's spot on the left flank after netting a brace apiece in the 8-0 rout of Jamaica last Sunday.
 Meanwhile, Honduras' preparations for the tournament were hit when midfielder Arnold Peralta was ruled out with a thigh injury, but, with strikers Jerry Bengtson and Carlo Costly having scored 16 goals between them in as many qualifiers, Luis Fernando Suarez's men may have the firepower up front to cause France problems.
 The Central American nation have never won a game at the World Cup, bowing out in the group stages in 1982 and 2010. However, following their hard-fought 0-0 friendly draw with England last Saturday, Deschamps is expecting a combative approach from Honduras.
 "They have the aptitude for going into combat, we're expecting that," Deschamps said.
 "It's one of the characteristics of this team. I saw their last match against England."
 France will be widely anticipated to win by a handsome margin, but Suarez has already warned against underestimating his side.
 "People underestimate us, so we can do this," Suarez said.
 "The group is evenly matched, there are going to be good possibilities for everyone.
 "In the end, our ambition is to improve on what Honduras has done in the World Cup before. Our challenge is to get into the next round."

Somos tan poco ortodoxos -y esto me viene genial porque todavía no he podido ver ‘Unorthodox’, la serie que tanto está gustando- tan poco ortodoxos, decía, que vamos a comenzar las críticas de los viernes… con una serie que se estrenó el lunes. Pero es que va a ser una de las series del año. Estamos hablando de ‘Run’, ‘Corre’, la nueva serie producida por Phoebe Waller-Bridge, dirigida por Vicky Jones… y que se puede ver, a razón de capítulo por semana, en HBO. Esta serie es magia. El otro día tuiteaba que me quiero quedar a vivir en ella y no estaba exagerando nada. Además, vosotros y vosotras, meros mortales, podéis ver solo un capítulo en HBO… pero los periodistas, que somos mucho más privilegiados -y mucho menos espabilados- hemos podido ver 5… y la cosa no deja de mejorar. La premisa ya es muy buena. Y de ahí para arriba. Dos treintañeros habían pactado 15 años atrás que si uno le mandaba al otro un SMS con la palabra ‘Corre’ y el otro respondía con otro ‘Corre’, tenían que dejar todo lo que estuvieran haciendo, encontrarse en un punto determinado y huir juntos durante una semana. Bien. No solo me ha ganado el corazón el hecho de que dos “pseudomillenials” sigan usando SMS, que también -aunque manda narices-, sino que las chispas que saltan entre los protagonistas, que son Merritt Wever y Domhnall Gleeson, podrían reincendiar la catedral de Notre Dame. En su huida loca y ferroviaria… los dos elevan el guión como si estuvieran jugando al voleyball en cada escena. De verdad. Capítulos cortitos que os pueden alegrar los lunes. Hacedme caso. Vamos con una producción española. La primera serie de ficción de Aragón Televisión, que desde hoy viernes salta también a la plataforma HBO. Es ‘El último show’, una serie que -en la estela de ‘Qué fue de Jorge Sanz’- juega con la idea de que Miguel Ángel Tirado -o sea, Marianico El Corto- quisiera abandonar su personaje y dedicarse a la dirección de cine surrealista, a lo Luis Buñuel. Vamos a decir que la serie de Álex Rodrigo es, lo primero, muy entrañable. Se nota que todo el proyecto rezuma cariño por Miguel Ángel y que eso se nota en la producción, construida a base de nostalgia. Parece que su apuesta es la sencillez, y no vamos a negar que en algunos de los capítulos… esa sencillez se nos convierte en unas tramas un poco -demasiado- simples, pero el personaje central tiene tanta fuerza y una mirada dramática tan potente [que no habíamos visto nunca en él], que el visionado engancha. Dadle una oportunidad, igual os sorprende. El hundimiento de 'Sergio'La española Ana de Armas y el colombiano Wagner Moura, el Pablo Escobar de ‘Narcos’, son los protagonistas de la película ‘Sergio', que hoy llega a Netflix. Es un biopic sobre la vida de Sergio Vieira de Mello, el diplomático de la ONU encargado de la reconstrucción de Irak en la posguerra del año 2003. Lamentablemente ese mismo año fue asesinado durante un atentado en Bagdad, y la película de Greg Barker intenta ser una suerte de reparación, un acto de recuerdo y homenaje, como ya lo fue el documental que el director le dedicó en el año 2009. Y sin embargo se desmorona. No por su calidad de producción, que la tiene, sino porque la película política que pudo ser -Vieira de Mello era conocido por ser un negociador muy hábil- se queda en una historia de amor con algunos insertos políticos bastante simplones. El director se centra demasiado en la historia del diplomático con la economista Carolina Larriera -que es Ana de Armas-, y esa decisión marca demasiado a la película. Hasta hundirla, vamos. Nos quedan dos cintas más por comentar que, en este caso, sí vamos a recomendar. Llega a Filmin ‘Asamblea’, el primer largometraje de Álex Montoya. Es una película basada en una obra de teatro que ironiza sobre los procesos que nos hemos montado los humanos para tomar decisiones. Imaginad una asamblea, en la que no sabemos muy bien qué se está decidiendo, pero que entra en una espiral de enmiendas y de reproches. En el reparto, Greta Fernández o Nacho Fresneda. Está bien, dadle un play en Filmin… Y en la Sala Virtual de Cine, ‘Los profesores de Saint Denis’. Hemos visto ya trillones de películas sobre la educación francesa en las barriadas. ¿Esta es una más? Esta es una más. ¿Cuenta algo esencialmente distinto a todas las anteriores? Esencialmente, no. ¿Y por qué la recomendamos? Bueno, la película tiene algo. Tiene cierta frescura en la relación entre los personajes de los profesores, los vigilantes de conducta del colegio y los alumnos. Y tiene también una reflexión sobre los “itinerarios especiales” en la educación, para los chavales y chavalas que necesitan un currículo propio, que yo creo que para estos días en los que tanto hablamos de educación desde el encierro… puede ser muy útil. Así que también le damos un sí.

As announced on Easter by a local church, some Kansans are going to soon receive what will seem like an unexpected Christmas present.
   
 Thanks to a donation from Fellowship Bible Church of Topeka, people across the state will receive yellow envelopes in the mail containing notice that their medical debt has been "paid in full."
   
 Rev. Joe Hishmeh, live streaming his Easter sermon from home last Sunday, invited a member of the church staff to join him to make an announcement. Frank Eschmann, FBC's LifeCare pastor, joined on the web presentation to explain an investment made on behalf of the church to retire medical debt for some of the most needy Kansans.
   
 Eschmann described to the viewers online that, through a company called RIP Medical Debt, the church had been able to retire about $4.7 million of medical debt with a $40,000 investment.
   
 "I've learned that there are people who are really, really struggling that we are going to be able to help," Eschmann told viewers. "People who can't even rent an apartment because of this medical debt. And I've learned about the forgiveness of Christ even in my own life -- a free gift and how that's impactful."
   
 Hishmeh said that, in addition to other outreach programs and missions the church supports, FBC had money available in its budget to put toward some other initiative. The church studied RIP Medical Debt and the far-reaching impact of retiring the debts of people who are most unable to pay them.
   
 "I was not aware of how it worked, so I had to do a crash course," Hishmeh said. "You don't know the people you are buying it for. You just know the type of debt you are buying. We bought the debt of a segment of the state who are least able to pay it."
   
 Hishmeh said hundreds of people across the state will receive a letter, with no prior warning, that reads:
   
 "We are pleased to inform you that you no longer owe the referenced debt(s) to the provider listed in this letter. RIP Medical Debt ... acquires and then cancels the unpaid and unpayable medical debts. The funds provided for this act of debt abolishment were generously provided by a donation from Fellowship Bible Church."
   
 As per guidelines of the program, the church will not learn the names of the recipients. Hishmeh said that is in line with the desires of the church, which was to offer a symbol of the grace presented by God at Easter time.
   
 "The reality is that we have a debt that we owe to God that is far greater than our capacity to pay," Hishmeh said. "The only reason God paid this debt through Christ is because he loves us. God didn't wait for us to come up with the resources. He provided the payment. We didn't want to just receive that blessing. We wanted to share it with others, no strings attached."
   
 Hishmeh said RIP Medical Debt has paid off $1.4 billion of medical debt for about 650,000 people. He said the average debt retired is $2,153, but some debts retired may be as high as $50,000. Hishmeh said unpaid medical debt can be crippling to individuals and families who wish to get their lives on better financial footing.
   
 "It's affecting everything about their lives," Hishmeh said. "It's hitting your credit report, so you're not even able to rent an apartment. When we heard this could be done for pennies on the dollar, we wanted to be a part of it."
   
 Hishmeh said the church leadership started planning last summer to buy medical debt. The church paid $40,000 in January, hoping to have the process completed before Easter. COVID-19 slowed down the process, so there are still some details being resolved.
   
 "We didn't plan on COVID-19 to be on everyone's minds at Easter," Hishmeh said. "It was so poignant to discuss medical debt while people are self- quarantined due to the virus. Both medical and financial concerns are on everyone's minds at this time."
   
 Eschmann noted in the Easter service that he knows members of FBC have their own debts to deal with. While the conditions of the RIP Medical Debt campaign don't allow the church to choose whose debt is paid, FBC plans to work with members of the church to help with their financial burdens as well.
   
 "I only wish that we could wipe out all of the medical debt that people in our church family are dealing with, but of course you know that's not possible," Eschmann said. "What we want to be able to do is come alongside people who are struggling.
   
 "So we are assembling a team of people who have expertise in this area, that can help people negotiate and work with health care providers to set up plans to work out arrangements. If our church family is struggling, we want to help."

HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Honolulu Police have arrested a 37-year-old homeless woman from the mainland for violating the state’s 14-day quarantine for travelers.Aarona Lopez arrived here from Phoenix on Monday. But instead abiding by the two-week quaratine, the aspiring social media comedian wound up in a tent village on Waimanalo Beach, angering nearby residents worried that she might be carrying the coronavirus.“I think it was selfish and irresponsible of her," said Waimanalo Neighborhood Board member Kukana Kama- Toth.Kama-Toth was among the many Windward residents who were tracking Lopez’s whereabouts on social media and urging police to arrest her.Residents reacted to an alleged quarantine violator with social media posts like this.“She traveled all over the place, undetected until it was brought to our attention, which puts the lives of our community members at risk," Kama-Toth said.Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said she slipped through the cracks because she listed a Post Office Box instead of a real address for airport screeners, who didn’t check out the address.“What should have happened is they should not have been allowed out of the airport and they should have been put back on a flight to the continent where this woman came from,” she said.In her Youtube videos, Lopez said she has not been infected by the coronavirus and that she’s the target of a cyber bullying campaign.“I abided by everything they told me at the airport," she said.Because Lopez’s bail has been set at just $500, the mayor and others worry that she’ll be back living on the streets soon.Copyright 2020 Hawaii News Now.

Drawn in a tough-looking Group B alongside 2010 runners-up the Netherlands and dark horses Chile, the 2014 finals were always likely to provide a difficult test for both teams.
 Australia, the lowest ranked side of the 32 coming into the showpiece in Brazil, were not expected to progress beyond the group stage but Spain, defending champions and winners of the past three major international tournaments, remained among the favourites to lift the famous trophy come July 13.
 However, Vicente del Bosque's side were almost unrecognisable in losing their first two games, a 5-1 thrashing at the hands of the Netherlands followed up by a limp 2-0 reverse to Chile that confirmed their elimination.
 While Spain will see Monday's clash in Curitiba as a chance to salvage some pride from an abysmal title defence, Australia will feel theirs remains intact after two heartening displays.
 Spain's exit has caused some to suggest that their reign as the dominant force in world football is over, with speculation that Del Bosque could leave his post, but Fernando Torres believes their final fixture represents the opportunity to display their true qualities.
 "We didn't show our strengths in the first two games and now we have the chance against Australia," he said.
 "We're expecting a real tough game. It's our last chance to win a game at this World Cup and to go back to Spain with three points and show everyone we have a lot of football for the future."
 Del Bosque could be tempted into making changes for the clash, with Koke replacing an off-colour Xabi Alonso at half-time against Chile and Diego Costa failing to impress in the loan striking role so far in the tournament.
 Despite losing both matches so far - 3-1 to Chile and 3-2 to the Netherlands - Australia have impressed many with their high-intensity displays, and Tim Cahill has been particularly prominent, scoring two of his side's three goals, including a left-footed volley on the run against Louis van Gaal's side that will be a strong contender for goal of the tournament.
 Unfortunately for head coach Ange Postecoglou, Cahill will miss the final game through suspension having picked up a booking in each of the previous matches.
 Experienced campaigner Mark Bresciano is likely to miss out with a hip problem, while Mark Milligan (hamstring) is also a doubt.

ROCK HILL, S.C. Chandler Vaudrin is a man in search of a gym with an open door.
   
 The former Lake High School standout is now a junior at Winthrop University, a place he transferred two after two years playing close to home at Division II Walsh University and sitting out one season under NCAA transfer rules. He headed to Winthrop with one goal in mind and as of the championship game of the Big South tournament, he believed he'd achieved that goal.
   
 All of that changed four short days later when the news came down that the NCAA tournament, to which his team had just earned an automatic bid, wouldn't be played due to the growing COVID-19 crisis.
   
 "It was a lot to deal with to be honest ... I had always dreamed of going to play in the NCAA tournament and when won that Sunday (in the conference title game), it was amazing," Vaudrin said. "I was really excited and I had lots of friends and family around me for the championship game. To cut the nets down was awesome."
   
 That feeling was what the 6-foot-7 junior guard had in mind when he decided to transfer to Winthrop even though doing so meant sitting out a season. His success and all-around game displayed at Walsh convinced him that it was time to make the move and when he looked for a landing spot, he singled in on a Winthrop program that has been to the NCAA tournament regularly in recent years, becoming one of the most frequent mid-major programs to earn a bid to March Madness.
   
 When he arrived in Rock Hill, he recalled, head coach Pat Kelsey literally tossed him a basketball and told him that this was his team now, a mandate Vaudrin has taken to heart. He averaged 9.3 points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists per game in his first season for Winthrop, helping his new team to a 24-10 record and a convincing run through the conference tournament.
   
 That set the stage for a scene that he, his teammates and dozens of men's and women's college basketball teams across America experienced when the NCAA canceled its postseason tournaments. Those affected included former Federal League rivals such as Ohio State junior and former Jackson standout Kyle Young, and left all involved grappling with how to handle what was transpiring.
   
 "We got back to practice and we heard the news Thursday after practice when we had a team meeting," Vaudrin said. "It was disheartening with all work we put in all year long, but as weeks have gone by since then, I've realized this is about a lot more than basketball ... it's a real world problem and it was the right decision as much as it's frustrating."
   
 Since then, he's heard from a lot of friends, family members and others who have called or texted and talked about what he and his teammates are going through. Unlike many of his teammates, who headed home once news came down that the school would transition to online-only classes for the rest of the semester, Vaudrin remained in Rock Hill largely because he knew that back home in Ohio, all of the gyms where he might be able to go and shoot were closed, while the Winthrop gym remained open.
   
 It has since closed, leaving him in search of a place to get shots up and continue working, and he admits that if he found out there was a gym back home where he could get some court time, he'd quickly head home.
   
 His family, including his father, Bryan, mother, Laurie, and older brother, Chaese, are supportive of him and his efforts to stay active and playing wherever he can during the pandemic.
   
 He's had plenty of conversations about what might have been had the tournament been played and although he will have another chance at achieving that dream next season, missing out on this one stings. Because the crisis initially hit during spring break, he took a week off to process what was happening, but has taken to working out on the school's outdoor track, making sure he's eating well and doing whatever he can to stay sharp so that when basketball resumes, he's ready to go.
   
 During the time when the gym was still open and he was one of only a few players still on campus, he'd often go and shoot on his own, something he enjoys doing.
   
 "I like going on my own; it's kind of peaceful," Vaudrin said. "That's what great with sports ... you can go to sports as a getaway and that's what makes it weird now, that you can't get away because sports are stopped like everything else."
   
 He pointed to sports being an escape for so many people, but because of social distancing measures and rules preventing large gatherings, having games at any level is an impossibility at this point.
   
 For now, his outlook is staying healthy and in shape, following the various rules and guidelines for staying safe during the crisis, and keeping an eye on being ready for what comes next.
   
 "It's different for sure, but at the end of day, these circumstances were thrown at us and we didn't get to play in the NCAA tournament, but that's more motivation to come back and do it next year," Vaudrin said.
   
 How all of that will play out and when the next steps in the process will take place remain uncertain, so at the moment, it's a day-by-day process of navigating an uncertain time in sports and the world in general.

April 12 looked like any other Easter weekend at Wilson Canyon.
 Several dozen off-road vehicle-users and motorhomes were camped out on the Bureau of Land Management Property, with a few fishermen trolling the Walker River. There were no more than 50 or 60 people camped at the property, but this year, the number of people had some Lyon County residents angry.
 The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office received about a dozen phone calls and emails from citizens worried about visitors to Wilson Canyon spreading COVID-19 into the Smith Valley area.
 “We are very concerned about the people from California camping in Wilson Canyon Recreation Area,” a Smith Valley resident wrote in an email to Sheriff Frank Hunewill. “They will visit our one local grocery store and our one local hardware store, plus our three local restaurants that do takeout. Can you please help us locals until COVID-19 is over. We have tried really hard to support each other while keeping our social distancing practices.”
 An anonymous caller to the Mason Valley News expressed a similar sentiment.
 “There’s at least 50 RVs and they’re all from California with their dirt bikes and their side by sides,” the caller said. “Why the hell are all these Californians bringing their disease to Mason Valley and Smith Valley?”
 But, the Lyon County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have jurisdiction over the property – and, technically, Hunewill said, the people there weren’t doing anything wrong.
 Hunewill drove through the canyon Friday afternoon and estimated he saw several camps, each with 20 or 30 people, all with UHVS or dirt bikes.
 “Most of those were family units,” he said. “The individual units were pretty contained within their groups … They were just kind of sticking to themselves.”
 Hunewill said his department only has jurisdiction over people and property crimes in the canyon.
 “As far as enforcing who has access to forest service or BLM property, we don’t have jurisdiction,” he said. “And, the federal agencies can’t enforce state law.”
 Lisa Ross, public affairs specialist for the BLM, said there are no immediate plans to shutter any recreation areas beyond the already-closed Sand Mountain Recreation Area near Fallon and the Indian Creek Campground in Alpine County, two of the Carson City district’s most heavily-trafficked areas.
 She said a large part of the closures hinge on the number of visitors the areas draw.
 While several dozen people were at Wilson Canyon over Easter weekend, she estimates that Sand Mountain usually draws 3,000 to 4,000 people on Easter weekend.
 “With the weather as good as it’s been and kids out of school, people have wanted to get out, and we totally understand that,” Ross said. “Closing public lands is very controversial, even during this time.”
