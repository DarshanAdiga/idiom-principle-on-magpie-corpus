En el reporte, se observó que el 60.1 por ciento de la población de 15 años y más en el país se ubicó como económicamente activa. Esta tasa es menor a la del mismo mes del año anterior en 0.3 puntos porcentuales, también con cifras desestacionalizadas.

Many are astonished by all that India has been able to do, both domestically as well as globally. PM Modi has emerged as one of the most trusted national leaders as compared to many others as several surveys have pointed out. In a way, this is remarkable from the point of view of India’s soft power. We have earned huge goodwill as several initiatives of the government have been a testimony to our fundamental approach, that of 'vasudhaiva kutumbakam', or the world is one family. As far as shortage is concerned, we must consider the fact that after almost one century, for the first time, we as a nation are facing a challenge as serious as this. I think India has shown remarkable alacrity, decisiveness and courage in facing this situation.

"Y cuidado también con querer disfrazar esas medidas diciendo, 'no hay problema, se van a pagar todos esos créditos'. ¿Y cuál va a ser la garantía, las reservas? No, no. Las reservas no son del Banco de México, no son del Gobierno, son de la nación, de todos los mexicanos", indicó.

In most issues, the fundamentals of India’s foreign policy have been on the lines of 'continuity with change'. I think PM Modi has been trying to build upon what was achieved during PM Vajpayee’s rule. Comparisons are neither relevant nor necessary. Our keen desire to have good neighbourly relations with all neighbouring countries, our non-compromising approach towards our national interests and our resilient as well as a balanced approach have been there in the past as well as in the present.

It is too early to comment on this. One need not elaborately comment about the way the global community has started perceiving China. Everybody knows that. But, as I said, China too is watching these reactions and has not apparently reacted very aggressively. So let’s see. As far as India’s investment policy is concerned, I think every sovereign nation is free to work through its own policies, rules and regulations drawn in its own interest. The message is very clear, and this move need not be overstretched to be misinterpreted. While we are not against globalisation and we also want FDI, everything will have to be on our own terms to the extent possible, and in our national interest. How can any country compromise with its own interests? Let’s not be presupposing certain things as far as the India-China relationship is concerned. It’s just one single important policy decision. Neither should anyone be undermining its importance nor should it be seen as something unprecedented. Let’s have a balanced approach and I believe, the government of India always takes a holistic view and its responses are also very measured and carefully calibrated.

Well, I think one need not harp upon those (Tablighi Jamaat) unfortunate incidents now. It’s a thing of the past. And, we are a democratic country where one can’t control social media as well. Besides, our relations with most countries in the world, including those that are members of the OIC, are age- old. They are on a firm footing of mutuality of trust and cooperation. More importantly, our relations are too strong to be spoilt by some social media posts.

Well, it’s a competitive world. Any democratic country always provides you more elbow room to do business without any fear of injustice. Why only G7. There are many other countries as well who will see India as better investment destination. I am confident it will happen. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath ji has already instructed his officials to explore the possibility of attracting companies deserting China.

Recent reports said that the lawyers demand $200 billion in damages for the “loss of lives, economic strangulation, trauma, hardship, social disorientation, mental torture and disruption of the normal, daily existence of people in Nigeria,” according to a statement by the lead counsel, professor Epiphany Azinge (SAN), whose firm, Azinge and Azinge, is championing the action.

Why should every message by the PM be looked at with a crass political approach? And remember, AYUSH people also undertake huge amounts of research. Let’s come out of the thinking that what Lancet or any such global journal endorses alone is research based. The world pays attention to what our traditional sciences tell, much later. We knew about the medicinal value of turmeric for times immemorial, but when it came to registering patents, those ridiculing ayurveda rushed earlier.
