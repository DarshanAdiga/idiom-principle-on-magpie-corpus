MISSOULA, Mont. — The popular “Yellowstone” series featuring Kevin Costner announced Friday it plans to move its production to the Missoula Valley and surrounding locations later this month.
 Local news media reported the series was formerly shot in Utah and will be filmed solely in Montana for the first time in its history, according to Friday’s announcement.
 The production secured a 40,000-square-foot space on more than 100 acres in Missoula, though the exact location wasn’t disclosed. The lease for “Yellowstone” production facilities was brokered by Sterling CRE Advisors of Missoula.
 “Montana is poised to welcome productions of this size and caliber,” said Matt Mellott of Sterling. “While not every building is a turn-key sound stage, all it takes is a visionary investor to see the potential in their own backyard. This owner isn’t walking into a typical lease.”
 The unique needs of the project included additional insulation for soundproofing so filming wasn’t disturbed, he said. It also required more restrooms to accommodate changing crew sizes, along with more parking and air conditioning.
 “There are more variables than usual in play with this project, but I think that’s what makes this exciting,” Mellott said. “It’s exciting from an economic development perspective, especially with production during Montana’s fall shoulder season.”
 HyperBlock Inc., a cryptocurrency mining operation, ended production at the Bonner mill site in May. But those behind the “Yellowstone” deal couldn’t confirm or deny the production’s new location, other than to say it was in Missoula.
 Sterling said the location will remain active through fall and will host approximately 40 full-time staff members. As many as 150 staff will be on-site for filming.

These measures are especially important when a client goes into what the BDSM community calls "subspace" -- a mindset that comes from immersion in a submissive character.
 Many people describe it differently, but Rage said: "I've heard it described as when you just wake up from the best nap of your life, and you're still not completely coherent, but you feel amazing and euphoric a little out of your mind."
 "Nothing in the immediate realm matters," she said. But that means they are extra vulnerable to taking unintended damage -- and it's her responsibility to ensure they don't.
 ## Rage would instead suggest OnlyFans -- "be brave, be creative, go for it."
 "Anything where that's you on your own? Be brave, people, be creative, go for it," she said. "These digital things are amazing."

MOUNT LAUREL -- On its 40th anniversary of providing hospice care to South Jersey residents, Samaritan is dropping the word "Hospice" from its name.
   
 The nonprofit organization is renaming itself, from Samaritan Healthcare & Hospice to Samaritan, and rebranding itself, too, from an organization that provides just hospice care to one that offers several other services as well.
   
 In 2020, Samaritan still specializes in hospice care, offering treatments that make the end-of-life process comfortable for patients, both at their homes and at the non-profit's campuses in Mount Holly, Voorhees and now Mount Laurel, a new facility that opened this year.
   
 But the organization also provides palliative care, which is basically hospice care, treatments that make people comfortable, but for patients of all ages. In addition, Samaritan does primary care for residents who can't leave their homes, transitional care for people in between treatments and therapies, and grief and bereavement counseling for anyone who needs it.
   
 With such a wide variety of services, the nonprofit helps 11,000 patients a year and maintains a staff of about 400 employees, according to Joanne Rosen, the organization's vice president of marketing & public affairs. Its new headquarters, at 3906 Church Road in Mount Laurel, is 27,000 square feet.
   
 Even during the coronavirus pandemic, Samaritan has kept up its patient schedule and retained all its staff members, though they are wearing masks and personal protective equipment during in-person appointments, and expanding telehealth services.
   
 Four decades in, Samaritan is a visible, multi-faceted, high-functioning community institution. The phrase "Healthcare & Hospice" was both no longer necessary to identify the organization, and no longer adequate to describe its versatility.
   
 "People look at hospice and they pigeon-hole us as end-of-life only," said Stephen Goldfine, Samaritan's chief medical officer. "This shows that we take care of the health of the entire community."
   
 In name and in practice, Samaritan has blossomed beyond its core service and humble roots.
   
 In 1980, a group of volunteers founded the organization out of a little historic house on West Second Street in Moorestown.
   
 After attending a local talk given by Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the modern hospice movement in England, the volunteers decided to open one of the first hospices in the United States.
   
 They were inspired by the primary goal that Saunders was promoting, of finding a compassionate way to help people live with dignity in their final months.
   
 Over the ensuing years and decades, the hospice movement spread across the U.S., starting with all-volunteer organizations, like the original Samaritan, then called The Hospice of Burlington County, and blossoming into the big, job-creating, comprehensive care-providing organizations that you see today.
   
 But despite blossoming beyond those roots, Samaritan remains committed to Saunders' primary goal.
   
 According to Samaritan executives, each service, from hospice care to palliative care, is supposed to find a compassionate way to help people live with dignity. The only difference now is that Samaritan employees are doing this for everyone, not just patients with six months to live.
   
 "For 40 years we've been honoring that commitment," said Samaritan CEO Mary Ann Boccolini.
   
 Samaritan is usually handling about 475 hospice patients at a time, and most receive treatment at their own homes, which is part of the process of helping them live out their final months with dignity.
   
 But it also, according to Goldfine, reflects the key dynamic of hospice-style health care.
   
 In areas like hospice care, palliative care and grief counseling, doctors aren't just sizing up illnesses and prescribing medications and lifestyle changes.
   
 They are asking patients what they want, what will make them happy and what will give them a higher quality of life. It's a holistic approach with modern doctors and medicine to back it up, according to Goldfine.
   
 Moving forward, into Samaritan's next 40 years, the goal is to expand this approach to even more areas, including to more traditional areas of medical care, like Alzheimer's disease.
   
 "If we can identify what's important to the patient early in the course of Alzheimer's, the outcomes are better because everyone, the physician, the patient, the family, is on the same page," Goldfine said.
   
 But the doctor also said palliative treatment is not a replacement for primary care. It's just a complement that can build a more holistic approach to a patient's health and well-being.
   
 "We are about life-enhancing care," concluded Boccolini.

Recent warnings about the danger of re-opening schools in the fall should give every parent, grandparent, employer, medical care worker and resident in our local communities great caution and frankly fear of the impact arising from not doing it right or carefully. Bringing young children together who would easily pass the virus from one to another in the typical school setting then having them bring it into their homes at the end of the day could set off a pandemic rise that is unprecedented in history.
   
 Think the impact of mass rallies without masks has been dangerous? How about the effect of demonstrations where thousands marched shoulder to shoulder, beaches, pool parties, sports venues, airplanes, etc?
   
 Here is one reasonable solution to the school problem - use classrooms in religious institutions to expand the spacial distance between children. Have some of the students attend class in a church, synagogue or mosque that has appropriate facilities (classrooms, bathrooms, kitchens for meals, etc.). Some facilities might be full-time alternatives, others part-time or special need locations, like sick care specialists.
   
 Church buildings are perhaps the most underutilized spaces in the entire nation, from an environmental perspective they certainly are the least 'green' structures in terms of energy to build and operate them for the amount of time they actually serve people in the community. These spaces could serve the community in ways not seen since the baby boom of the post-WWII years.
   
 Yes, it will be costlier and a huge challenge to pull off logistically, but not meeting the challenge creatively and boldly will also be costly in more than just financial terms. Lost development mentally, emotionally, socially and physically for children continually isolated in their homes for an extended period of time will have lasting impact that will scar a generation with untold repercussions for decades.
   
 I urge both school officials and religious leaders to come together to discuss the possibilities, to think outside the proverbial "box" and to move forward with boldness and determination. Our children are our future, as the saying so often reminds us. Our future is here now, let's not squander the opportunity or so quickly toss aside the suggestion for fear of what it might take to achieve working cooperatively.

Which one you should invest in depends on your risk tolerance. Disney is the safer stock to invest in over the long haul, but Canopy Growth has much more potential, especially if the U.S. eventually legalizes marijuana and the Canadian pot producer can tap into that market. It's a riskier investment, but its potential returns could more than make up for that in the long run.
