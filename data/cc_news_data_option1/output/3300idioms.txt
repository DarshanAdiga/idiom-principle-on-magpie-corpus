Can Maximum Security, the even- money favorite on the morning line trained by Bob Baffert, match the dominant effort put forth by Game On Dude, another Baffert runner?

CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (AP) — Hurricane Genevieve weakened to a tropical storm on Thursday after lashing Mexico's Los Cabos tourist resorts with hurricane- force gusts and heavy rains. And two new tropical depressions formed in the Atlantic Basin — both on potential tracks toward the United States.

The official margin was 8 1/4 lengths, just a quarter of a length off Game On Dude's record 8 1/2-length rout in 2013. Beholder was sent off as the 2-1 favorite, but the way she ran, the ease in which she put away some good horses, she performed like a 1-9 shot.

 # Police say 4 MPD officers were shot at during traffic stop; man charged with attempted murder
 Micaela A Watts
 Memphis Commercial Appeal
 A Cordova man has been charged with four counts of attempted first-degree murder after investigators said he fired shots at a group of Memphis police officers as they conducted a traffic stop.
 According to court documents, Calvin Davis, 31, was not part of the traffic stop, but police say he fired at four officers from across interstate lanes on Aug. 8.
 Four officers were standing on the shoulder of Interstate 40 near the Faxon Avenue overpass wrapping up a traffic stop when they heard the gunfire.
 One of the officers turned in time to see a light-colored SUV speed off. Afterward police were able to gather casings from a .40-caliber handgun at the scene of the shooting.
 When investigators reviewed footage from a Tennessee Department of Transportation traffic camera, they were able to spot a light-colored SUV parked on the shoulder of a westbound lane of I-40, across the road from the officers conducting a traffic stop.
 According to police reports, the SUV remained parked along the shoulder for 20 minutes while the group of officers conducted the unrelated traffic stop. The SUV sped away after the shots were fired.
 Davis was taken into custody Aug. 8, but not for any actions related to the first-degree murder charges. Instead, investigators learned from Shelby County Sheriff's Office deputies that Davis evaded deputies twice that same day after they attempted to pull him over for erratic driving. He eventually crashed his vehicle, investigators said.
 On Wednesday, investigators learned from deputies that Davis was potentially involved in the shooting on the interstate.
 After a comparison of photos of Davis' car, he was interviewed at 201 Poplar. Police said Davis waived his Miranda rights and provided a written statement, admitting he fired at police.
 In addition to four attempted first-degree murder charges, Davis also faces 11 additional charges, including evading arrest, possession of marijuana, driving on a median and driving while intoxicated.
