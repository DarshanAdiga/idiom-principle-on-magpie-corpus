TORINO - Il tecnico della Juventus, Andrea Pirlo, ha parlato ai microfoni di Sky Sport al termine di Juve-Barcellona. Queste le sue parole: "Sapevamo fosse una partita difficile contro un avversario di qualita, sapevamo di fare questo tipo di partita ed e una partita che ci servira per la crescita. Risultati? E' sempre momento di risultati e spero adesso di riavere altri giocatori perche e difficile con tanti impegni far riposare tutti. Sconfitta frustrante? Quando rimani in 10 e frustrante, ma i giocatori non hanno capito che dovevano continuare a pressare. Dybala e Kulusevski attaccati? Dovevamo posizionarci meglio sul campo poi dipende dalle situazioni e in effetti non devono essere cosi vicini. Chiesa poco servito? Abbiamo provato a tenere Chiesa sempre largo, tenendo centrale Bentancur e Rabiot da mezzala. L'obiettivo era lasciare spazio a Chiesa per fargli fare l'uno contro uno poi sono i giocatori in campo che fanno delle scelte. Salto di qualita a centrocampo? Prima (quando Pirlo giocava per la Juventus ndr) il nostro centrocampo era di grande esperienza e ora siamo un reparto di giovani, ci vorranno partite e piu esperienza per poter arrivare a giocare alla pari contro il Barcellona".

Instead of talking about Mookie Betts, Corey Seager, and the satisfaction of finally getting their first World Series title since 1988 fans were talking about the virus. Instead of simply packing up and heading home on Wednesday, the Dodgers and Rays had to figure out who was healthy, who was not, and whether it was safe to travel.
 That includes Roberts, a cancer survivor who is sitting next to a maskless Turner in the team picture. Just as he was enjoying the weight of the world being lifted by finally winning the World Series in his third try, Roberts now has a bigger worry — that he could be infected, too.
 Before Turner ignored MLB security to take the field his reputation was pristine. He’s the heart and soul of the Dodger team, and it wasn’t October until you saw Turner with his unkempt beard and flowing locks hacking away at home plate.
 Off the field he’s known for his charitable efforts and engagement with the community. Everyone loves Turner, from his teammates to Andrew Freidman, the Dodgers director of baseball operations who was seen talking to a maskless Turner afterward.

As Americans cite a rise in Kobe cases here at home Europe is fighting a new wave of cases abroad. Germany is imposing a new partial lockdown to slow the spread in France is expected to announce its own restrictions. KBC news foreign correspondent Maggie really joins us now from London. With the latest on that Maggie some of these lock downs are pretty strict how bad are the numbers right now and what kinds of restrictions are we looking up. Hey Danny and his numbers just keep rising it seemed like over the past month nearly every day we're seeing a new record numbers and hospitals lesions as well as cases. The governments have tried really hard this past month not to go into a total lockdown. Here in the UK it was sort of region in a region each one was in a tear and they tried to not going that nationwide lockdown but now. It seems like this week all of Europe is turning a corner more and more countries it seems that a new and every day are going into a full lockdown you mention France. You mention Germany Germany just announce that new lockdown. A nationwide but cute and even then governments are hesitant in saying it's not like the last time Germany is calling there's almost. A light lockdown so while things like bars and restaurants are closed. Other things like schools and hair salons are able to remain open and even said. You know try to stick to just your household if you have to see one other household he can do that sedan we're seeing this constant balancing negotiation pieces are rising. They know they have to do something many are going into lockdown but they also are debating how much can you really ask of people. Tenet similar situation do with the US is dealing with as well. Yet sure as you know and here we do see that and that division when it comes to restrictions some people are really worried they feel like things like lock downs or necessary. Others want to see the economy stay open an and don't want to Wear masks. How does a debate going there and how do you think it's compares to thaci the same kind of push back. There and as we see here in the US. Get and it's funny it seems like every country's dealing with these same questions he same pushed fax. How do you handle a pandemic how do you handle lock downs and get I think a lot of people want this clear answer from the government but they do acknowledge that. There are no clear answers in a pandemic we went out and spoke with a lot different people in London today and how we come true the same underlying thing at the bottom of the day. They're just frustrated they're getting tired of a lockdown they want answers. But the answers aren't really there to listen. Is that it has been an EPA guidelines were being. They sit something clinical back when men and plummeted to its home page schooled and they can say to school this vacate events could just put an accident videos and then to bring into the house that would enmity I think it's just cheap and easy. That would be I think people of them have made a mistake thinking they need to balance economics was withheld when there's nor economy when they're sick a pandemic sweeping through your country it's. You have to handle that first night I think some of kind of aired on the wrong side. Here in the UK I think and I think there's been back again some mixed messaging. And could have been incidences where rules of seem to apply to some people enough to others. Basically people in positions of power are actually government. I'm sort of frustrating I think for the average Londoner the average Brit. But you know this a country that just carries on so we. Hazardous I think people are gonna whether this. Autism making sense that. A sometimes they just can't make some rumors but without thinking many human they don't care anymore. You can send and I even laying miles. The people that just acting only like moment days before her own not knowing mosques and then don't handle it just off single. We've waited so hot be different says I'm restrictions. And speaking with another restriction. It's just Qichen is down again. And a final man we were just hearing from he's said he's shutting down his business he just cannot keep up with the different restrictions that are being thrown at him and that's something that is also a lot of concern how many businesses. Aren't going to survive and dangerous is really interesting to note we as speaking with these people three out of four of the people you just heard from told us that either. They themselves have already had co bit of someone other households had it so clearly. There's so many people have been affected by this whether it's their business whether it's their health so while everyone wants us to be over it's not over any time soon.

The Big Ten has said previously a cancellation will be recorded as a no- contest, regardless of whether a program is in the red-red zone or not.
 Last week, Nebraska coach Scott Frost said he did have concerns about the conference trying to fit nine games into a nine-week window.
 “I think there’s concern,” he said. “I think if you want to play and you find ways to play, I think you’ll find ways to play. If you find ways and reasons to not play, I think you can accomplish that goal, too.”
 This is the second time in three years that Nebraska has had a game canceled. Frost’s debut in 2018 against Akron was scuttled by lightning. That year, at least, the Huskers had a bye week later that they were able to fill in with FCS Bethune-Cookman.

So let me be clear, I'm not going to go into 2021. Let's just get through 2020. And we said all along, we anticipated for the year to have continued double-digit margin expansion throughout 2020. We believe in the fourth quarter we'll continue to see the similar trends. We'll have double-digit margin expansion going into the fourth quarter of 2020, which is very encouraging driven by as Mr. Ficalora indicated the substantial drop in our cost of funds both CDs and borrowings. We have approximately $5.8 billion coming due in three months at 1.46% cost of funds, marketplace between 46 and 70 basis points. That will probably roll somewhere in between that level. We have $11.6 billion coming due from 12 months on an outlook on CDS at 1.21%. You bring it down between 50 to 70 basis points, depending where interest rates go, which we believe rates will be going lower, depending on the overall economic climate and a lower for longer reality in interest rates.

Nao existe mais aquela historia de que, caso mude de prefeito, os programas serao terminados. Por isso, criamos a secretaria municipal para o idoso e realizamos a construçao de programas permanentes na cidade. Isso demonstra respeito a melhor idade", destacou.      Samuca ressaltou ainda que os programas herdados das gestoes passadas para a terceira idade foram continuados e aprimorados em seu governo.      "Os programas dos nucleos nos bairros foram mantidos e ampliados. Os professores da SMEL, que eram RPA, agora sao concursados para a continuidade do trabalho e o vinculo com o idoso. Realizamos ainda a viagem da terceira idade para o Rio de Janeiro e para um Hotel Fazenda. Com a pandemia da covid-19, fomos prejudicados, mas, no ano que vem, com a casa em ordem, as viagens vao voltar a ocorrer anualmente", comentou.      A implantaçao do Hospital do Idoso, no antigo Sao Camilo, segundo o candidato a reeleiçao, demonstra mais uma vez o respeito a terceira idade.      "É um hospital que tem 95% de aprovaçao pelos pacientes que ja ficaram internados. É uma unidade com atendimento humanizado, com equipe preparada, quartos individuais, estrutura para o acompanhante, entre outros. Nossos idosos merecem mais e nao podem ser utilizados para a politica. Respeito e entregar politicas publicas", acrescentou.

The situation is much different given the Big Ten’s pandemic-shortened season. After the conference decided to eschew the 10-game schedule it had built that maximized flexibility because it didn’t feel like it had enough answers on rapid testing or potential side effects of the virus to start in September, it pushed the start date back to Oct. 24. That meant attempting to play a schedule that features nine games in nine weeks up, with no wiggle room, up to a league title game on Dec. 19. That’s a hard deadline because currently the College Football Playoff committee is set to select its field on Dec. 20.

GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina couple is accused of getting around paying employment and income taxes for almost a decade to help cover their own spending, federal prosecutors said. James and Susan Rice were indicted Tuesday by a grand jury in Greensboro on conspiracy and tax evasion charges, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for North Carolina's Middle District said in a news release. Prosecutors said James Rice was an orthopedic surgeon in Southern Pines, and Susan Rice worked at the practice handling payroll and employment taxes. According to the news release, between 2007 and 2014, the Rices allegedly withheld employment taxes, but didn't pay more than $580,000 in social security and other tax withholdings to the IRS. The indictment also alleges the Rices didn't file individual income tax returns from 2014 through 2016 despite exceeding the filing threshold. Prosecutors said the couple spent money on boarding their dog, a country club membership and visits to Susan Rice's spiritual adviser, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. The Rices face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each conspiracy, tax evasion, and employment tax count, and one year in prison for charges related to failing to file individual and corporate tax returns.

 # Our view: Local legal system works hard to balance safety, transparency
 AJ Media Editorial Board
 It’s been a difficult balancing act for those involved in seeing that the wheels of justice turn at the appropriate speed. The challenge confronting the legal system since March has been the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has shuttered in-person courtroom activity.
 Earlier this month, prosecutors, defense attorneys and sheriff’s deputies reviewed two large rooms at the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center that serve as venues for jury selection for a trial that would have been the first in the community since the pandemic took hold last spring.
 While the alternative plan might have worked for a sexual assault trial set for the 137th District court, Lubbock’s upward trajectory of virus cases caused the proceedings to be postponed by Judge John McClendon. There is no arguing with the decision, new cases have regularly been numbering several hundred, and the hospitalization rate has crept beyond 20%, further stressing already weary local healthcare resources.
 Ultimately, the decision to move forward rests with the presiding judge, and McClendon made the right call in light of the virus-related circumstances in the community. The Lubbock County director of court administrator, Dean Stanzione, said the decision to postpone was made in the best interest of all parties involved in the trial.
 The balancing act is the constitutional requirement that trials be open to the public and that they take place in a speedy manner while a global pandemic makes protecting public health of everyone involved a priority. As our story reported regarding this particular trial, 400 jury summons were issued with 90 responding, meaning it would have been possible to procure a 13-person (12 jurors, one alternate) pool of people to hear the case.
 However, putting nearly 100 people together, even with face coverings and social distance requirements observed, still creates risk. “It’s really a difficult situation for us,” Judge William Eichman of the 364th District Court said in our story. “I think, partially, we kind of have to weigh the public risk with the defendant’s constitutional rights and make a determination.”
 The use of the Civic Center for jury selection is part of a local action plan required by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order last month that outlined necessary steps for jury trials during the pandemic. The plan requires approval of the local administrative judge and the regional administrative judge and is to be submitted to the state’s office of court administration.
 Eichman is also the local administrative judge. He said the earliest day another trial could be set is Nov. 16, according to our story. That decision would be dependent on a meeting next week with criminal court judges, the district attorney’s office and the private defender’s office with only motions for a speedy trial being considered.
 Equally critical, though, will be the local hospitalization rate falling below 15%. When a trauma area exceeds that number for seven consecutive days, a series of capacity restrictions and other measures meant to slow the spread of the virus begin. Lubbock reached the seven-day mark Sunday. The measures remain in effect until the city falls below the 15% mark for seven consecutive days.
 While the judicial system must move in as quick and transparent manner as possible, its important work must also be done in the safest way possible.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed an executive order Wednesday preventing landlords from evicting tenants who are unable to pay their rent. The order, which aims to clarify an existing residential eviction moratorium outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will remain in effect for the rest of the year. “Many families are trying to do the right thing,” Cooper said in a news conference. “They're having to make tough choices, but this virus has made it difficult.” A report prepared for the National Council of State Housing Agencies estimated 300,000 to 410,000 households in the state are unable to pay rent and are at risk of eviction, and 240,000 eviction filings could be submitted by January 2021. Together, landlords face a rental shortfall ranging from $632 million to $824 million. The order notes that the CDC moratorium applies to all eligible residents, regardless of whether they live on federally subsidized housing. “The result during this global pandemic will be more North Carolinians staying in their homes, more landlords getting paid rent and fewer utility companies shutting off of power,” Cooper said. The governor's announcement comes at a time when the state is grappling with an uptick in coronavirus cases, which Cooper does not yet consider a “spike.\" The state partially reopened bars, amusement parks and movie theaters earlier this month while easing indoor and outdoor gathering restrictions. Large venues such as football stadiums also have been able to have more fans in attendance for games. The so-called Phase 3 reopening plan ends Nov. 13, giving Cooper about two more weeks to decide whether to ease or tighten current restrictions. “We don’t have plans to go back,\" Cooper said.

So I would say that historically, the company had a loan-to-deposit ratio as high as 165. So we're not there, but we've had some improvement. It's been a long time since the bank has executed on an M&A transaction. And obviously, our historical growth in deposit has been driven through M&A. So the goal here in the long run is that eventually as we continue to focus on our business model, which includes putting businesses together and getting that funding side short up on through consolidation that's always a possibility. But absent that, I think you're going to see probably we'll call it nominal deposit growth and we'll still choose based on what's best for the shareholders as far as cost of deposits and duration. And right now, the wholesale markets are very attractive. They're more attractive than what's offered out there and we'll call it the hot money CD market. Clearly, you can put on 5-year money, lower than you could on the CD market. If you go short, you're looking at between 25 to 38 basis points type cost of funds, depending on your duration risk that you want to take. So there is this business decision you have to make, when it comes to repricing your deposits aggressively for growth. And again, our growth is manageable, it's reasonable. We're not targeting 10% type loan growth and asset growth, we're still shooting for that 5% net loan growth number driven by multi-family and specialty finance, offset by the CRE reduction. So I think with a reasonable growth on our internal deposit analysis, we can grow between a small portion of that on deposit growth as well as repricing the funds lower aggressively and benefit from a unique opportunity on the wholesale side, which is cheaper than retail in this current environment. With the proviso that in the event that we're fortunate to be able to put something together on the acquisition side well this business combination side that's where this model can change dramatically to have a different funding mechanism.

The pickup truck driver charged with causing the deaths of seven motorcyclists in New Hampshire last year told authorities he had drug problem, regularly used heroin and cocaine but believed he was not impaired at the time of the crash.
 The admission by Volodymyr Zhukovskyy was included in a trove of documents released Wednesday by federal investigators related to the the June 21, 2019, crash in Randolph. The National Transportation Safety Board also announced that it will hold a hearing Dec. 1 to discuss probable cause, findings, and any safety recommendations from its investigation.
 Zhukovskyy told Massachusetts State Police after his arrest he was using three or four bags of heroin a day and had used both heroin and cocaine the morning of the crash. He acknowledged that he could feel the effects of the cocaine after his last delivery but that he was “fine and okay to drive.”
 Zhukovskyy has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of negligent homicide and driving under the influence. He remains in custody as he awaits trial expected early next year. Prosecutors had previously reported in documents that Zhukovskyy had drugs in his system at the time of the crash including fentanyl, morphine and a chemical found in cocaine.

 After the two candidates defeated challengers from their own parties in a February 2020 primary, Tiffany defeated Zunker May 12 in a special congressional election to fill the House seat vacated with the September 2019 resignation of former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a Hayward native and Wausau Republican. The candidates were also on the ballot for the Fall Partisan Primary in August 2020.

 # Trees died for this?
 Bucks County Courier Times
 We like to imagine that our proudest trees aspire to generate the paper upon which great works of literature, grand legal treatises and altruistic laws are printed.
 But we feel for those that get cut down and beaten to pulp so political action committees can send more mailers full of false and misleading claims.
 Republican state Rep. Todd Stephens, who represents the 151st District in Montgomery County, recently showed us a few of the campaign mailers and commercials that are attacking his bid for re-election.
 One commercial paid for by the Pennsylvania Fund for Change, a PAC pushing Democratic candidates, painted him as being on board with the "extreme NRA agenda" despite the fact that there are 109 House Republicans and Stephens is one of only three to earn an "F" grade from the NRA this election season.
 Another, paid for by the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said he "cut millions from public schools." The claim stems from Stephens' support for House Bill 800, a proposal to bolster school choice by increasing the amount of tax credits available under the Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program by $100 million. It's important to note that the money that funds the EITC comes from the state's general fund, not from state appropriations for education.
 Also important to note: Gov. Tom Wolf vetoed the bill when it got to his desk. But the mailer seems to suggest otherwise, claiming that "to close the school funding gap Todd Stephens created in Harrisburg, local school districts were forced to raise property taxes."
 Of course, the false or misleading mailers and ads are coming from both ends of the political spectrum. The Republican Party of Pennsylvania and the political action committees that support its candidates have relentlessly attacked Christina Finello, the Democrat who's running to unseat U.S. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick in the 1st District.
 One ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund attempts to link Finello with the riots, looting and vandalism that stemmed from police shooting protests, saying she "proudly sides with" extremists.
 The basis for the claim seems to be that NARAL Pro-Choice America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund endorsed Finello. Those groups previously issued statements supporting demands made by the Movement for Black Lives, including but not limited to defunding the police and investing in Black communities.
 Negative political ads such as these both feed and capitalize on the divisiveness of the current hyperpartisan political climate. The sad fact of the matter is that if we took the principled stand to withhold our votes from any candidate whose opponent is the victim of an unfair smear during the campaign, we'd have to stay home on Election Day.
 So instead of assuming that stance, we'll issue a call for voters to either dump these mailers straight in the recycling bin or carefully vet their claims before voting on Tuesday.
 Political action committees and state and national party machines spend millions of dollars — and kill countless trees — on mailings like these. They do so because negative ads are very effective.
 If we want the ads to go away, we need them to stop working so well. Instead of buying what they're selling, we should start feeling insulted that these PACs believe we're too busy, too lazy or too gullible to verify that they're telling the truth in the proper context.
 Politics is a nasty business and these mailers ultimately feed an angry, cynical electorate. Until we vow to do better — or true campaign finance reform is enacted — that won't change.

It’s another week in the red for San Diego County

But he said the state’s testing scores are down and it is becoming harder to attract qualified teachers.
 In the WPR debate, Armstrong said local districts have each voiced different concerns, and he said he wanted to organize more discussion on those needs, particularly mental health care.
 Housing
 Both candidates also discussed housing in the WPR debate.
 Armstrong said he has worked extensively on local housing issues for the past 3 years.
 “Perpetually we’ve had 500-550 open jobs in Barron County. We couldn’t fill those jobs, we just didn’t have enough people,” he said.
 Housing was key to closing that workforce gap, said Armstrong, adding he consulted five different government agencies to find solutions, including Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority.
 “All of rural Wisconsin had problems with WHEDA on how they score on housing programs,” said Armstrong.
 He said he helped come up with solutions with WHEDA, and now the county has several housing developments in the works, particularly in Rice Lake and Chetek.
 Ellenson said it was important to increase the allocation of housing funds to northern Wisconsin.
 “The issue is where are the tax dollars coming to,” he said. “Our tax money has gone to southern Wisconsin and it hasn’t necessarily made it back.”
 Both candidates have also said creating more broadband access, offering affordable health care and supporting businesses and individuals through the COVID-19 pandemic are priorities in their campaigns.
 Current 75th District representative Romaine Robert Quinn is not seeking re- election after serving three terms, 2015-2021. Wisconsin’s 75th District includes all of Barron County, parts of southern Washburn County and some townships in Burnett, Dunn, Polk and St. Croix counties.

It doesn't mean that every loan has been cash flow positive. But the results that we see here to get to that high bar standard of additional relief request for the most part, most customers were able to do their debt service coverage ratio adequately. It may not be at 1.67%, maybe they're at 1.1% or 1.2%, but the reality is the money is coming through we gave them six months of balance sheet relief. And now they have excess cash flow and they were very thankful for that because obviously it helped them out to work with their own customers on the ground floor, especially on the commercial side. So, I'd say that there has been no question obvious reason an adjustment in the marketplace. But given the low LTV that the company has, we have a 47% LTV and clean the 48% original LTV in Manhattan. These are low LTVs. So in the event that, they come back to the bank and which they will because obviously they're relatively short-term assets, we're very comfortable on refinancing them. And you can see by the origination flow, we've been doing that. Our overall retention rate has been spot on all year north of 50%. The goal was to keep it at 50% to shoot for that 5% net loan growth number for the year. This is coming from our own portfolio. We believe that that may improve as we get into the fourth quarter because obviously, we see a lot of these customers coming to us in particular we have about $1 billion that are up for renewal this quarter, which is our own portfolio. And we believe that all of these loans will have the ability to be able to refinance within the portfolio. So, we're very confident there.

Command, which tipped off the state to Arias, opened up shop in 2012 and quickly rose to prominence in Florida by catering to the lucrative employee leasing industry. Unlike temp agencies, which find workers and task them to businesses, employee leasing companies promise to lower businesses' overhead by hiring their employees on paper and then leasing them back. The basic premise is that by pooling the risk of several small businesses, leasing companies can bargain for better insurance rates. Such a setup is especially attractive to mom and pop firms in dangerous industries, such as construction.

One thing is certain: A highly contested election would cause further damage to America’s global image as an exemplar of democracy and the rule of law, eroding its soft power.
 Particularly over the past four years, the country has increasingly come to be regarded as a political basket case.

CRESTWOOD — Crestwood has granted an indefinite waiver to a company doing bypass pumping work to allow the company to work around the clock. Without the waiver, approved by aldermen Tuesday night, the work would have violated city code that restricts when companies can do construction work.

The race has made headlines statewide and beyond for Armstrong’s controversial social media habits. First Armstrong was quoted in a Sept. 6 Associated Press story on his social media support for the QAnon, saying he found some aspects of the conspiracy theories to be credible. On Sept. 15 his retweet of a video featuring Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in 2015 resurfaced in a story by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. Armstrong apologized for the tweet, saying he didn’t recall posting the video and didn’t watch it all the way through.
 More recently the Barron County Economic Development Twitter account, which Armstrong sometimes used to express right wing views, was deleted, prompting more outcry from Democrats.
 The Barron County Economic Development Corporation board has vouched continued support to Armstrong in recent letters to the editor.
 Police funding
 Both candidates have made a point of supporting police.
 “I strongly oppose calls to defund our police especially after what we saw during the violent riots in Kenosha, Wauwatosa and Madison. It’s important to understand the critical role law enforcement plays in our communities. We all deserve safe communities where families thrive and businesses prosper,” stated Armstrong, a Law Enforcement Foundation of Barron County board member, on his campaign website.
 In a Sept. 30 press release, Ellenson said, “The killing of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake have sickened all of us. As did the senseless violence and destruction of property that erupted in their aftermath, heaping tragedy on top of tragedy.
 “I support a number of proposals to make us all safer, and each and every one of them - body cameras, additional protective equipment, de-escalation training, and more crisis intervention workers - requires more funding for our police and first responders, not less.”
 Education
 In an Oct. 2 interview with Wisconsin Public Radio, Ellenson advocated for more school funding and rejected the idea of private school vouchers.
 “Private school tax credits don’t really help us here,” said Ellenson. “We have wonderful schools, and people take pride in our schools.”

A consumer battle has been raging in America’s Heartland for several years, as farm equipment becomes more high-tech and companies like John Deere resist giving independent repair shops access to the computer codes running their giant machines. Doing so could lead to calamity, according to tractor companies who want to keep the service, parts and repair business for themselves. On the other hand is the ridiculous scenario of farmers who beg and borrow $600,000 to pay for a harvester that they themselves cannot fix when it breaks.
 The same dynamic is at play in Question 1 on next week’s ballot. We’re not talking combines so much as cars, trucks and SUVs. The referendum seeks to update the state’s “Right to Repair” law, allowing consumers and independent repair shops access to data collected and transmitted by their cars. Voters should support the update by marking “yes” on Question 1.
 The debate over the referendum is clouded by technical detail — and $42 million worth of spending on both sides, and counting. At issue are “telematics,” the information captured by your car’s computer and streamed back to a manufacturer who uses that data to guide future design decisions -- and also to prompt you to visit the dealership for an oil change or to rotate your tires.
 The state’s original “Right to Repair” law, passed seven years ago, covers codes amassed by your car’s computer. But it does not specifically give consumers and their mechanics license to real-time “telematics.” Hence we have a ballot question once again pitting car makers against the auto repair industry.

And as far as the overall risk we see, I think the risk has shifted a little bit. Initially when we had signed up a lot of customers on deferral, we write a little bit about mixed-use. And if you look at where the mixed-use is right now at the $701 million commercial mixed-use portfolio, we're down to $57 million on deferral that's a pretty sizable reduction and we should hopefully work through that in the next month. And then when you look at what's left on retail, retail has dropped substantially as well. We have $1.7 billion in retail. And right now, we have about $189 million left on deferral which pretty much will work itself out in November. So those not -- those slides say the shift may be into office. And obviously office there has been a lot of noise in office in New York City. So we do have approximately $800 million left on deferral at office. Interesting story with office, we had a large customer that we've had identification I mean he may have difficulty paying and we contacted that customer. And at the end of the day, he paid 41% LTV, family asset class. It's something that his family generated over time and it's a very low LTV. And ultimately, we have buyers for the node. So if in the event for some reason we had to go that path, we have people lining up at par to take the asset. So we're a low leverage lender in particular in the New York City marketplace in Manhattan. And given that there's been a little bit of shift into office, but retail has performed better-than-expected as did mixed-use. So we're very pleased with the portfolio, we expect outside of our core product being multi-family. As far as the multifamily is concerned, it's been very robust on the collection side.

ARLINGTON, Texas, EE.UU. (AP) — Justin Turner quebrantó el protocolo sanitario por el coronavirus cuando ingresó al terreno de juego del estadio Globe Life para celebrar con sus compañeros de los Dodgers de Los Ángeles y que hizo caso omiso de las órdenes del personal de seguridad de retirarse. Según Grandes Ligas, la conducta de Turner puso en riesgo la salud de otros. La oficina del comisionado anunció el miércoles que abrirá una investigación al tercera base de 35 años. Los Dodgers conquistaron su primer campeonato de la Serie Mundial desde 1988 con una victoria 3-1 ante Tampa Bay en el sexto juego la noche del martes. Turner fue sacado del juego tras el séptimo episodio luego que MLB recibió la notificación que dio positivo por COVID-19. Fue aislado en una sala médica, reveló el presidente de operaciones de béisbol de los Dodgers Andrew Friedman. Pero Turner reapareció en el terreno de juego con una mascarilla para celebrar la consagración de los Dodgers. Se quitó la mascarilla al posar para una foto junto a todos sus compañeros alrededor del montículo. “Immediatamente después de recibir la notificación del laboratorio de una prueba positiva, los protocolos fueron aplicados, y se decidió sacar a Justin Turner del juego\", dijo MLB en un comunicado. “Turner quedó aislado para proteger a los que le acompañaban. Sin embargo, luego de la victoria de los Dodgers, fue fehaciente que Turner optó por ignorar los protocolos acordados y las órdenes que se impartieron para velar por la salud y seguridad de otros”. “Si bien el deseo de celebrar se puede entender, la decisión de Turner de salir de su aislamiento y entrar al terreno estuvo mal y puso en riesgo a todos los que estaba cerca.

For the first time in his career, that group includes Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina. At 38, Molina has spent the previous two decades with the Cardinals organization, and each time he neared free agency he and the team negotiated an extension months ahead of time. Molina is coming off a three-year, $60-million contract.
 The other three Cardinals declared free agents early Wednesday were Adam Wainwright, Brad Miller and Matt Wieters.
 Wainwright has been a free agent before, on paper. Before signing his incentive-laden deal for the 2019 season, the veteran righthander had to become a free agent in order to take a pay cut of more than 20 percent. The same rule is in play for Molina if the Cardinals' offer is less than the $20 million salary he would have had for a full 2020 season.

Remember, we have a lot more people going back to the various locations and if there is an expense that's associated with that dealing with getting the branches up and running. So all the branches for the most part are up and running for the time being depending on the pandemic but clearly with some expense there. So I'd say, it's split between conversion and PP&E.

"At the end of the day, personal responsibility is the only way. People will either choose or not choose to socially distance," Lee told reporters on Wednesday. "Or choose to wear a mask or not, they will choose to make that personal decision. What we can do is to remind them is that personal responsibility can protect them."

"We have a lot of vets on our team who have been around not only this program but the league. They show their leadership daily with their encouraging words in there and what they do on the practice field. So we just follow guys like Matthew Slater, Jason McCourty, Devin McCourty, guys like that Brian Hoyer, guys who have been around the league, Lawrence Guy, guys who have been on multiple teams before and we just listen to what they have to say and we just follow suit."

While a team must halt practice and competition if it is in the red zone in both categories, that is not the only way for a game to be called off. The protocol says if a program is orange-orange or orange-red, it should do multiple things including "consider viability of continuing with scheduled competition."
 It is unclear if Wisconsin had breached into "red-red" as of Wednesday morning's decision, but the fact that they have additional tests pending suggests the school expects its numbers to continue to climb as the week progresses.

Barcelona has been in turmoil this week after losing the “clásico” 3-1 at home to Real Madrid last weekend, while club president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his entire board resigned on Tuesday.
 But the scoreline could have been worse for Juventus if the visitors had been more clinical with their chances.
 Barcelona almost took the lead with less than two minutes on the clock as former Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanić forced a save from Wojciech Szczęsny before Antoine Griezmann’s follow-up bounced off the left post.
 It didn’t take the visitors much longer to break the deadlock. Messi played a great ball over the top to Dembélé on the right flank and he cut inside before unleashing a shot which was deflected into the far top corner.

When Hurricane Sally knocked down his fence and hurled debris across the Florida Panhandle, John Rebolledo didn’t just clean up his yard and call it a day. Instead, he gathered up the hurricane’s forgotten treasures and spent a month turning it into a life-sized pirate ship.
 Now there’s a 17-foot-long (5-meter-long), 10-foot-tall (3-meter-tall) pirate ship in his driveway, complete with a red treasure chest, two skeletons and a skiff boat just in time for Halloween. Rebolledo built the boat using mostly wood fencing that had fallen down, saying the more weathered and beat-up, the better.
 It’s been a boost for the entire neighborhood, even prompting one neighbor to dress up as Captain Jack Sparrow from “Pirates of the Caribbean” and pose for pictures with local kids.
 Rebolledo said the ship started out much smaller, something that could fit in the back of the car, but it grew as he continued to work on it. As Hurricane Zeta approached Wednesday, he said he was moving it into the family’s garage for safety but planned to put it back out on full display for his three kids and the rest of the neighborhood to enjoy.

"Finish, Rashy," Solskjaer hollered before Rashford did just that. That was his second in four minutes and a reckless tackle by Marcel Sabitzer presented United with a penalty. Solskjaer instructed Anthony Martial, goalless all season, to step up ahead of the usual taker Fernandes or hat-trick hunter Rashford. Martial got off the mark and Solskjaer smiled smugly but Rashford refused to be denied the match ball. Solskjaer's in-game management was flawless yet again.
 Pogba was more expressive in an advanced role where he was largely spared of defensive responsibilities, shared by Matic and Fred, undroppable again in spite of the acquisition of Van de Beek. United's £221million midfield quartet was underpinned by a renascent Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire, so vocal he could have been heard at Salford Quays.
 Lindelof has had his best week in 18 months and tends to reserve his finest performances against the elite. His and Maguire's axis, secure again after a porous start to the campaign, is well-timed after the desirable Dayot Upamecano familiarised himself with The Lowry Hotel. Upamecano's first visit to Manchester was as miserable as the weather and he is on common ground with Maguire after enduring his own five-goal humbling in M16.

Volta Redonda - Em programa eleitoral no rádio desta quarta- feira, dia 28, o candidato à reeleição a prefeito de Volta Redonda, Samuca Silva (PSC), ressaltou a importância da manutenção dos programas para a terceira idade na cidade. Samuca, diante disso, reafirmou a importância da criação da Secretaria Municipal de Políticas para Mulheres, Idosos e Direitos Humanos.De acordo o prefeito Samuca, os projetos para a terceira idade com o Fórum Municipal de Políticas Públicas para a Pessoa Idosa, os debates para a construção do Plano Municipal do Idoso e a secretaria municipal específica para a terceira idade, dão a garantia para a cidade da continuidade de projetos.“As políticas públicas para os idosos, em Volta Redonda, a partir do nosso governo, são permanentes na cidade. Não existe mais aquela história de que, caso mude de prefeito, os programas serão terminados. Por isso, criamos a secretaria municipal para o idoso e realizamos a construção de programas permanentes na cidade. Isso demonstra respeito a melhor idade”, destacou.Samuca ressaltou ainda que os programas herdados das gestões passadas para a terceira idade foram continuados e aprimorados em seu governo.“Os programas dos núcleos nos bairros foram mantidos e ampliados. Os professores da SMEL, que eram RPA, agora são concursados para a continuidade do trabalho e o vínculo com o idoso. Realizamos ainda a viagem da terceira idade para o Rio de Janeiro e para um Hotel Fazenda. Com a pandemia da covid-19, fomos prejudicados, mas, no ano que vem, com a casa em ordem, as viagens vão voltar a ocorrer anualmente”, comentou.A implantação do Hospital do Idoso, no antigo São Camilo, segundo o candidato à reeleição, demonstra mais uma vez o respeito a terceira idade.“É um hospital que tem 95% de aprovação pelos pacientes que já ficaram internados. É uma unidade com atendimento humanizado, com equipe preparada, quartos individuais, estrutura para o acompanhante, entre outros. Nossos idosos merecem mais e não podem ser utilizados para a política. Respeito é entregar políticas públicas”, acrescentou.
