With earnings season in full swing, one notable phenomenon in the stock market these days is that many firms have withdrawn financial guidance -- a forward-looking statement to investors which includes revenue estimates and projected earnings -- for the remainder of the year. Based on an analysis by IR magazine, since mid-March, 779 companies have withdrawn annual guidance and 69 companies have withdrawn quarterly guidance.

 Reed returned five kickoffs for touchdowns in college. No Charger has scored on a kickoff return since Michael Spurlock on Dec. 30, 2012.
 At 6 feet and 224 pounds, Reed offers a potentially daunting combination of size and speed, attributes that convinced some teams to consider drafting him as a running back.
 Though he carried only 34 times for 172 yards in college, Reed ran for more than 2,000 yards and scored 38 touchdowns as a high school senior in Virginia playing wildcat quarterback.
 He’s two inches taller and 25 pounds heavier than Chargers running back Austin Ekeler. Although he’s four inches shorter than Mike Williams, Reed has five pounds on the 1,000-yard receiver.
 “Being able to use my size and my speed ... creating tons of mismatches,” Reed said when asked what he’ll give the Chargers. “Going forward, I’ll work on being more fluid, playing faster and just getting ready to play with the big guys.”
 Moving to Southern California will represent quite a departure for Reed, who said he can’t recall traveling west of Louisiana.
 He grew up in Charlotte Court House, Va., a roughly 500-person town that occupies four square miles and includes a courthouse designed by Thomas Jefferson.
 “I wouldn’t trade it for anything,” Reed said. “Really down home, the whole hunting and fishing thing. That’s how I came up. Most of the time we were outside doing something.
 “Other than hunting and fishing, just play ball. There really isn’t much to do other than make your own fun. Yeah, this will be a little different for me.”

"There's no smoke and mirrors here," Berntsson said, stressing that the zoning change calls for only five single-family residences to be zoned on five lots.
 Only two residences sit on the property now. Berntsson said his client will be purchasing then transferring the remaining residential units onto the property. His client intends to sell undeveloped, five lots.
 Technically, Berntsson requested the 20 acres to be down-zoned since a planned unit development, approved in 2006, would allow as many as 41 housing units to be built on the property. But to build that many homes, an approved site plan with roads and other amenities would have to be followed.
 When it comes to suspicions of low-income multi-family housing being built on the property, Planning and Zoning Official Shaun Cullinan said, "There was nothing indicated in the submittal, nor is multi-family allowed (in PE-1 zoning)."
 Cullnan had no idea how or why the idea of affordable housing bubbled up among the residents.
 The advisory Planning and Zoning Board voted unanimously to recommend county commissioners adopted the changes. Next month, county commissioners will vote on a subsequent land use map change that requires state approval.
 County officials will see then if the uproar among Oyster Creek and other San Casa residents has been quelled.

Former PGA Tour golfer Ernie Gonzalez has died. He was 59.
 Gonzalez reportedly died on Friday. The PGA Tour said Gonzalez died in a Chicago hospital due to causes related to Alzheimer's disease.
 The left-handed Gonzalez turned pro in 1983 and scored one career victory, winning the rain-shortened Pensacola Open in 1986. He finished 68th on the money list that season with $124,548.
 In 1988, he dropped to 207th on the list -- making just $14,135 -- and began playing sparingly through 1998. He played in Korn Ferry Tour tournaments from 1999-2010.
 Gonzalez played in one Champions Tour event in 2011 after turning 50 but he missed the cut at the Senior Open Championship in Surrey, England.
 Gonzalez was a native of Chula Vista, Calif., located just south of San Diego.

In a matter of one request, Savage’s summer business went from mowing and weed trimming to an all-out landscaping service. He dug up bushes, spread mulch and rock, tilled a garden and cut some trees down.
 “I got paid nice for that,” Savage said. “I’ve pretty much done it all. I cleaned a woman’s gutters the other day. No two-story houses though. I can’t do that. I’ve done everything really. Just depends on how big it is and how hard it is.”
 Savage wants the work, but he’s also ready to leave as soon as basketball calls.
 He recently hired Jeff Whitney as his agent for whenever the day comes that he can start a different career. Whitney is also the agent of hometown star and NFL offensive lineman George Fant, who recently signed a new deal with the New York Jets.
 This current stretch is the longest break Savage says he’s had from basketball since middle school. When the team got back from the Conference USA tournament it never played, Savage was relegated to working out in the weight room set up in his mom’s garage or running Hospital Hill downtown.
 He hasn’t seen any of his now former teammates since the team returned from Texas, even his roommate Carson Williams, who moved back home to Owenton. Basketball ended earlier than expected in March with the Hilltoppers looking to make a run at the tournament, which was canceled March 12, the same day WKU was supposed to play in the quarterfinals.
 “You were numb, almost,” Savage said. “You’re used to either winning a championship or getting your heart broken. There’s no in-between. You couldn’t really be mad about it. It was shocking, almost. I thought we had a good chance to go win it. I liked our team and our chemistry. We bonded in that locker room closer than probably any team I’ve been on. The things we went through that season, just put us that much closer.”
 Savage said he counts himself blessed that he and fellow senior Camron Justice can even pursue a further career in basketball, even if that’s on hold for the time being. Savage averaged 34.6 minutes in all 30 games last season with 11.7 points per game and leading the team after Charles Bassey’s injury with 7.1 rebounds per game. He also led the team with 33 blocked shots and had 37 steals, showcasing as one of Rick Stansbury’s most dependable players during WKU’s 20-10 season.
 “The country could open up next week and I’ll be gone overseas,” Savage said. “… Luckily we have the talent to go play somewhere else. There are some seniors in the country, they’re just done and that’s how their career ended, drop of the hat. Just thankful that I can go play pro ball somewhere.”

It’s an answer that requires approval from U.S. Congress and a question that outraged the island’s small group of independence supporters and members of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo. But it’s a gamble that members of the governor’s pro-statehood party are confident will pay off given that Puerto Rico has struggled to obtain federal funds for hurricanes Irma and Maria, a string of recent strong earthquakes and the coronavirus pandemic amid growing complaints that the island does not receive fair and equal treatment.
 “Everything important in life carries some risk,” said former Puerto Rico governor Carlos Romero Barceló, a member of the Progressive New Party.
 Previous referendums have presented voters with more than one question or various options, including independence or upholding the current territorial status, but none have been so direct as the one scheduled to be held during the Nov. 3 general elections.
 “Our people will have the opportunity once and for all to define our future,” Vázquez said. “It’s never too late to be treated as equals.”
 Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. And while the island is exempt from the U.S. federal income tax, it still pays Social Security and Medicare and local taxes and receives less federal funding than U.S. states. Many believe the island’s territorial status has contributed to its struggle to recover from the hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as worsened its economic crisis, largely caused by decades of heavy borrowing and the elimination of federal tax incentives.

"  
 If you're like most of us, there's only so much bad news you can take on any given issue. So, as a break, let's get off the coronavirus topic that's been sweeping the world. Instead, let's cover a more pleasant subject.
 Let's return to those days of yesteryear when spring-time in Ohio greeted us with warm, seasonal weather as we welcomed it with gardening, neighborhood get-togethers and other outdoor activities. After all, spring's a great time of the year, and after a long winter, the warm days of sunshine and soft cool nights for sleeping with the windows open from right after the eleven o'clock news until those first rays of sunlight peep over the horizon are a welcome respite from what ol' man winter delivers.
 Sit back, relax and think of days when roosters crow their cock-a-doodles letting the world know if they don't wake up life could surely pass them by. Think of those spring days when you and your dog camped under a full moon; your faithful, loyal friend, by your side for protection and comfort.
 Remember how you thought you could not have picked a better evening and how the two of you woke in the early morning hours to the sound of birds and other critters scurrying about here and there. And just like you, they too were taking advantage of spring's warm weather, at least while it lasted.
 A babbling brook bisects a meadow filled with patches of bright, yellow- blossomed dandelions and other multi-colored flowers as it gives rise to cold, clear, sparkling water for morning campfire coffee. And as your trusty sidekick sips the water, you, too, take advantage of God's loving benevolence with tightly, cupped hands.
 While adding fresh firewood to the dying embers, you absorb the surrounding panorama like no other morning view could produce and you watch your faithful companion playfully chase a bushy tailed squirrel up a tall hickory tree. Knowing full well he'll never catch it, the squirrel jumps from one limb to another and then out of sight. Realizing he's lost that game, he then spots two bunnies and starts a new chase, only to lose once again.
 You quickly realize the entertainment your dog provided was worth more than all the morning news could ever offer and you breathe in a deep and satisfying sigh of contentment.
 Chipmunks play about, filling their jaws with dried acorns and nuts left over from winter. As they scamper up trees to nests, feeding new family members, you wonder why humanity gave up all this for the \"comfort\" of city living and the rat race of trying to make it among millions of others. In spite of your inability to answer your own query, you're glad you are where you are, wouldn't trade the moment for anything the city has to offer and don't look forward to returning.
 Walking off a camp-fire breakfast, your dog and you hike about the meadows and hillsides and marvel at the small game that entertainingly romps before your eyes in an unrehearsed show no live theater could ever, or even attempt, to produce. And watching it you chuckle even more, thanking God once again for all He has given humanity. And in your mind, you wonder how long it will take for the rest of His creation just to experience what you have seen on this special day?
 At home, you look forward to finishing your garden, keeping it weeded and while sitting in a lawn chair, you enjoy those balmy breezes coming in off the lake.
 Ah yes! Springtime may mean something different to each of us, but whatever, it's always pleasant. It's always a happy moment. It's always welcomed and has an everlasting longing to continue. I could be wrong, but I doubt you can say that about any other season of the year.
 If humanity only opened their eyes and ears, looked about and listened, we'd be subjected to fewer disagreements among family, neighbors, friends, states and nations.

On this course, we had to speak Dutch from day one and we managed to do so fine! The teachers keep us in our bubble of Dutch words we know, and they do that so perfectly, that Dutch feels like my second mother tongue in class. Outside the classroom, I still have a long way to go, but I'm getting better at it every day. I have one piece of advice for those of you who want to learn Dutch. Start early!

Chris Eubanks has missed listening to live music with his friends at Nu-Way Lounge and Restaurant.
   
 Restaurants weren't allowed until recently to reopen for indoor dining due to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Henry McMaster's executive orders allowed restaurants to reopen this past week while maintaining social distancing requirements.
   
 On Friday night, local musician Shane Pruitt performed for a live audience at Nu-Way. Eubanks was excited to socialize with his friends and listen to live music again.
   
 "It feels good to be back in touch with everybody I know," Eubanks said. "Everybody is getting back into the swing of things and people need places to relax."
   
 Eubanks said the easing of social distancing restrictions should be done gradually so restaurants don't have to close again temporarily for indoor dining.
   
 "If we use a slow process and do things correctly, we will get where we need to get to," Eubanks said.
   
 Pruitt said he's always enjoyed performing at Nu-Way because everybody knows everybody. He's had time to be creative during the coronavirus outbreak performing with other musicians at his Spartanburg home.
   
 "It's given me headspace and freedom to create instead of working all the time," Pruitt said. "It allowed me to get away from the hustle and bustle."
   
 For the past two months, Pruitt said he's hosted jam sessions at his house about twice a week. He was ready to perform again before a live audience.
   
 "It's been nice to get back out here and shake hands and hug people and do what we are supposed to do and connect with people," Pruitt said.
   
 Nu-Way at 373 E. Kennedy St., Spartanburg has remained a popular destination for area residents for more than 80 years. Night-time manager Vikki Ervin said customers were excited to come back to indoor dining.
   
 "Take out got us by," Ervin said. "People kept coming in to get the food they love. When we opened up dining 50 percent, it was almost like it (COVID) never happened."
   
 Ervin said she was hopeful that McMaster would allow restaurants to open indoor dining sooner rather than later. She spent most of her savings to pay for bills during the shutdown.
   
 "I sat at home for two months planting stuff in my garden," she said. "I was so ready to see people again. I was broke and now I am not broke."
   
 Area residents also enjoyed live music outside the Spartanburg Marriott 299 N. Church St. Friday night.
   
 Adam Jennings of Lyman drove to Spartanburg to meet his aunt Susan Owens to enjoy entertainment.
   
 "Now that things are open, I couldn't stand staying home anymore," Jennings said. "I had a feeling of being pent up. I think we will all experience a new normal but for how long is still to be determined."
   
 Owens of Spartanburg said she had missed socializing in public places. Her routine the past few months has been going to work and heading straight back home.

 "It feels great to be out," Owens said. "It feels really good."
   
 Robby Ford of Lyman also enjoyed live music with his family at the Spartanburg Marriott. He's felt isolated while working from home.
   
 "I have been able to keep a really clean house," Ford said. "I am an extroverted person and have to learn how to interact with people again. The only interaction I've had is with my wife. I was just glad to get out and hear somebody singing."
   
 Local musician Michael Cash of Spartanburg played several songs in front of a small gathering of people at the Spartanburg Marriott.
   
 Cash said he almost decided not to perform but decided to go ahead and play music since he was playing outdoors.
   
 "This is my first time playing anywhere since February," Cash said. "It feels great. I think everyone has been stir crazy and been wanting to get out."

Fresh out of its _launch this week_, Deep Rock Galactic is already lining up a slew of new material for the coming year. An announcement _on Steam_ lays out the roadmap for the coming year in pretty good detail, starting with post- launch additions and focusing on an increased variety of environments and objectives. Over the remainder of the year the developers intend to add more geographic features, two new biomes, two new mission types, and three new secondary objectives.
 _Deep Rock Galactic_ is as silly as it is fun, a four-player co-op shooter about drunken space marine dwarves gathering ore and blowing up swarms of slimy space bugs. (More of those in the planned Q4 update, by the way.) The game has been regularly updated throughout its early access life, _as past news attests_, and I'd be surprised to see Ghost Ship Games stop development any time before 2021. The current update objectives were actually sourced from the game's community, to boot, with a recent post-game survey asking what kind of updates players wanted. It was, overwhelmingly, mission variety, which is what I wanted as well. Not that the game doesn't actually already have a lot of variety.

Calling it "an egregious case of the criminal-justice system gone wrong," the Texas Supreme Court on Friday came to the rescue of an East Texas man who spent two years in prison for breaking a law that had been declared unconstitutional.
   
 Ruling 7-2, the court said Colton Lester was entitled to be paid from a state fund that provides $80,000 for every year a wrongfully convicted inmate spends behind bars.
   
 State officials had declined to pay Lester, arguing that the money is reserved for people who were found to be "actually innocent" of their crimes.
   
 But Lester, who pleaded guilty to attempted online solicitation of a minor in 2014, was unaware -- as were his lawyer, the prosecutors and the judge -- that the law had been invalidated by the state's highest criminal court in 2013.
   
 The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that Lester's guilty plea was not an issue, concluding instead that no criminal act exists if the act isn't a crime under state law.
   
 "As a matter of historical fact, Lester's conduct was not a crime at the time it was committed," Justice John Devine wrote for the majority.
   
 "Lester is therefore actually innocent in the same way that someone taking a stroll in the park is actually innocent of the crime of walking on a sidewalk. No such crime exists," Devine wrote.
   
 Lester was 17, making him an adult in criminal matters, and a junior at Livingston High School, about 75 miles north of Houston, when he was charged with online solicitation after sending a text message propositioning a freshman girl for sex on April 27, 2014.
   
 That was six months after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had tossed out the online solicitation law, which had made it a crime for adults to send sexually explicit electronic messages to a minor with the intent "to arouse or gratify sexual desire."
   
 The court determined that the 2005 law violated the U.S. Constitution because, instead of being narrowly written to protect children from sexual abuse, it prohibited a wide array of protected speech.
   
 And, although the online solicitation law is back in service after lawmakers tightened its language, the new law applied only to offenses committed after Sept. 1, 2015, and had no bearing on Lester's case.
   
 The Texas Supreme Court on Friday also ruled on a second case involving the overturned solicitation law.
   
 A Denton County man, identified in court records as EH, was trying to get a 2007 arrest for online solicitation of a minor expunged from his record.
   
 After that law was struck down, EH was able to get his indictment and conviction overturned in 2016. The Texas Department of Public Safety, however, declined to remove the arrest from EH's record, arguing that state law clearly says arrest records cannot be erased for those who, like EH, pleaded guilty and were placed on probation.
   
 In an 8-1 ruling, the Supreme Court ordered the DPS to expunge the man's arrest record, ruling that EH's probation did not matter.
   
 "The statute under which EH was arrested has been declared unconstitutional, the indictment against him has been dismissed, and the court order placing him in community supervision has been vacated," Justice Jeff Boyd wrote.
   
 Laws declared unconstitutional -- and probation orders resulting from those laws -- are considered void from the start, as if they "never existed at all," Boyd wrote.

Golf in Palm Beach County only opened a few weeks ago, and strict policies are in place: arriving 20 minutes before the tee time; flagsticks in the hole; no raking bunkers; and devices, such as foam noodle, that keep players from reaching into the bottom of the cup (typically 4 inches) to retrieve their golf balls.

I’m currently taking the intermediate intensive course (A2 - B1) and the online classes we have are really good. Conversation between classmates and teachers is a big part of the course. For me, this is the most important thing when learning a language. You have to apply the new words in a context in order to learn how to use them. Another positive thing about the online classes is that I don’t have to travel to NedLes. This saves me two hours of commuting time a day, which means I have a few extra hours to spend on studying. Studying is very important in this course: you have to prepare the texts thoroughly to be able to talk about them in class.

The Stephenville ISD Board of Trustees met for a called meeting Monday afternoon and made some changes to the grading policy.
   
 The board agreed on a COVID temporary policy for the 6th six weeks where there would be six daily grades (as opposed to eight) with one grade per day and one summative assignment (as opposed to two).
   
 The council spent some time deliberating on whether to count GPA from the 5th six weeks since instruction was all online or to replace students' 5th six weeks GPA with their 4th six weeks GPA.
   
 Superintendent Matt Underwood told the council that from surveys conducted from the teaching staff and student council, there was a 60/40 split.
   
 "Faculty, six out of 10 believes that it would be more valid to count 4th six weeks and not the 5th six weeks," he told the council. "Students, however, would rather count the 5th six weeks, rather than not count the 5th six weeks.
   
 "I've been thinking about this for a long time. I don't have a problem with counting the 5th six weeks if the GPA is better. I don't want the 5th six weeks to harm you if you didn't have internet accessibility, if you weren't around your calculus tutor and weren't able to get those small groups that we have with counseling. Some of those upper level classes, their grades dramatically declined - in some cases 10 percent."
   
 Underwood suggested for administration to look at each student's GPA for both the 4th and 5th six weeks and then choose the higher GPA.
   
 "To me, I don't think there's any right answer," he said. "I do think at the end of the 4th six weeks, that grade is more valid, however, I think there is something to be said for students who have worked hard in this 5th six weeks, completed their assignments and turned them in."
   
 President of the board Dr. Ann Calahan voiced her concern about students having access to materials and their teachers while council member Cole Parks, place 6, argued that it isn't fair to students for the board to change grading policy after the end of the six weeks period.
   
 "The only way to keep it fair and equal is if we give a set of rules for the 5th six weeks and every kid went by the same set of rules," he said. "I'm all for changing the 6th six weeks. You lay the rules out there and you do what we can, but the 5th six weeks, we gave a set of rules, we need to play by the rules and not change them after the fact."
   
 Vice President Dr. Ed Dittfurth said Underwood's solution wasn't perfect but that there is no perfect solution.
   
 "This is the best scenario that I can see," he said. "It's not perfect, but I would support what the administration has presented to us."
   
 Sherrie Evans, place 2, agreed with Dittfurth and said she feels Underwood's suggestion is the best solution under the circumstances.
   
 "At the end of the day, it is our responsibility to do what is best for all students," she said. "I hope it tells our students and our parents that we care about all of our students. We had to make the decision of what we feel like is best for all students and I feel like this does approach that."
   
 All of the members except Parks voted for Underwood's solution of determining students' GPA based upon the higher average between the 4th and 5th six weeks.
   
 Grading for the rest of the year will be based on a pass/fall scale and final exams will not be given.
