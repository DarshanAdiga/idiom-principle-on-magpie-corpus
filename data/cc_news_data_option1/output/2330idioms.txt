 At a virtual meeting on Thursday night, project representatives presented South Middleton Township supervisors with a sketch plan of the first phase of a proposed three-phase development at 1201 Walnut Road, bordering Sprint Road. Stonewall Capital is proposing to build a phased community composed of apartments, townhomes, medical services and retail. Contracted builder is Burkentine Builders Inc., of Hanover.
 The project’s proposed first phase would comprise a total of 396 apartments and townhomes on a parcel of around 15 acres. The garden-style apartments would be situated in 24 three-story buildings and 60 townhomes with rear-entry garages, according to the sketch plan presented last week. The first phase also would include 10 units of detached garages, a 5,000-square-foot community clubhouse, and a total of 759 parking spaces.

But Floyd’s death has unleashed Black people’s collective rage that has been pent up for centuries.

Most of us have a vehicle, and as soon as we take that vehicle home, it begins to depreciate, and it is subject to a whole mess of potential issues. Even if it is brand new, it is possible you could get in an accident.          Hail could rain down while you are parked one afternoon in the mall parking lot, yet we keep buying new vehicles, and some buy a brand-new vehicle as soon as they pay off their old one. And then again are subjected to a whole new round of payments over however many years.          Buying a brand-new vehicle may make you feel superior, and maybe it impresses your friends. But it just continues to chain you to a never-ending cycle of consumerism.          Now your money will continue to be funneled into something you did not need when the one you had before worked fine. You are stuck in one place and not moving forward.          The fleeting moments of feeling superior to your peers will begin to escape you. In no time, you will have noticed that you no longer possess the newest version of an item, and you will fade into the background.          You no longer standout, but you want to. That is the brutal cycle of consumerism.          Others with newer items start to rank above you. And the cycle happens all over again. And instead of moving forward, you are stuck in a roundabout way.          Depending on the moment, maybe you are riding the crest of that curve, but it is only for a small moment.          We upgrade, trade in and strive for the newest and the brightest. And for some reason, we want to do these things to simply impress for a moment people in our lives, who if they were worth the time at all wouldn't place our value as a person against what items we have acquired and the newness of those items.          We are so much more then the materialistic things we have. And a physical item could never prove that we are a better person compared to others that do not have the means to obtain these coveted items.          An item could never provide you with stable physical and mental health. It can not, as the old saying goes, buy you happiness.          By letting go of a consumerism mindset we able to be more content, we feel less pressure, and spend less energy caring for and about objects. Overall, less energy is put out into something that only drains resources and vitality.          By finding less value in physical objects, we can find value in what we are able to contribute as a person.          We make room for traits, time, morals and goals.          The impact left on the planet is reduced. We have more time for experiences rather than items. Making do with what you have becomes more appealing. It becomes possible to further develop skills to take care of and refurbish the items we have.          When selecting items, we are able to purchase items of better quality if we plan on purchasing less often. Quality items that will stand the test of time are what we should be seeking.          Once we give up the need to express our value through material items, the pressure to impress starts to waiver. We will find that people still enjoy our company, that there are those that still want to spend time with us even though we may not have the most prestigious items.          And for those who no longer find value in a person without a surplus of expensive items, well, they are not worth the effort of a relationship anyways.          By moving out of the cycle of consumerism we are not only spending less, but we are spending less energy on trying to impress others, less energy trying to keep up with trends, and more time appreciating things that do not depreciate in value.

The Federal Communications Commission has "serious doubts" that low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers--including SpaceX--can deliver internet service while keeping latency under 100 milliseconds.
 In a lengthy report on the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund phase I auction (scheduled for late October), the FCC confirmed that while LEO companies are allowed to apply for rural broadband funding as low-latency providers, they should expect a fight. "Short-form applicants seeking to bid as a low-latency provider using low-Earth orbit satellite networks will face a substantial challenge demonstrating to Commission staff that their networks can deliver real-world performance to consumers below the Commission's 100 ms low-latency threshold," the FCC said.
 SpaceX has been hogging the headlines lately, over the weekend completing yet another Starlink mission, launching 58 branded satellites into orbit; Elon Musk's rocket firm plans to provide internet service in the northern US and Canada by year's end, with near-global coverage in 2021.
 The company is confident its satellites' roundtrip latency is up to par for consumers and the Federal Communications Commission. "SpaceX explained that its system easily clears the Commission's 100 ms threshold for low-latency services, even including its 'processing time' during unrealistic worst-case situations," David Goldman, director of satellite policy, wrote in a May 29 letter to the FCC.
 Still, SpaceX has a lot to prove and little time to do it. While the firm has launched nearly 500 satellites, it isn't yet offering a commercial service. And companies must submit auction applications by July 15--one month from today.
 "The record demonstrates significant concern regarding applicants that propose to use technologies that have not been widely deployed to offer services at high speeds or low latency, or have not been deployed at all on a commercial basis to retail consumers," the FCC said. "Auction 904 is not the appropriate venue to test unproven technologies using universal service support."
 SpaceX last year earned regulatory approval to develop a satellite constellation that offers a low-cost, high-performance solution to providing fast internet access. Called Starlink, it will eventually consist of close to 12,000 satellites spread across multiple orbits. Musk recently hinted at a private beta launch this summer, with a public beta by the end of the year, "starting with high altitudes," which, he confirmed, could include the German market.

That's a very important question. Thanks for asking. When we had spoken about this last time also, we had mentioned that we will look at all non-strategic assets, assets that do not make sense for us, the way that Azure looks at itself over the next few years. And we had mentioned that that basically means maybe very small assets, assets which are 4 MW, 10 MW, 20 MW because now we are going out and doing 4 GW, we're doing a 600 MW project, 300 MW project. So, therefore, those smaller projects are potentially non-strategic. We will obviously also look at projects that are further away in remote areas where we find that it is more difficult to drive operational efficiencies, we could look at projects that have higher tariffs. In the long run, we would want to see a host of projects that are large with low tariffs, selling to the best counterparties in the country.

Since screen sizes are generally used in their default state (in the sense that you can't or wouldn't need to resize it), the term "adaptive design" might fit the bill more accurately. Websites (well-designed ones at least) will modify their layout to fit the device of the user; it's an involuntarily action, meaning the user doesn't have to interact with the website to make it adapt. Adaptive design could also describe how we optimize loading times and _perceived_ performance for smaller, handheld devices.

The UK is projected to report a more moderate increase in jobless claims in May. A significant fall in wage growth in April may steal the show. The pound's positioning is critical for the reaction. What's more important, an incomplete read of the present or a deeper understanding of the past? Pound traders do not need to ponder on philosophy but rather deal with contracting figures published in the upcoming jobs report. In addition to the labor market figures, sterling's moves depend on the trend,. Fewer new claims Economists expect relatively encouraging news from the Claimant Count Change figure - or weekly jobless claims - for May. After a leap of 856,500 applications in April - far worse than the crisis peak below 200,000 - an increase of 370,000 is projected. There are several factors providing hope on that front. First, April was the first full month of lockdown, and most of those applying for benefits likely did so back then. Secondly, the British economy began opening up in early May, allowing businesses to rehire personnel - or refrain from laying off more people. The third factor is the government's furlough program, which has kept workers attached to their work even as they stayed idle. Contrary to other aspects of Westminster's dealing with the coronavirus crisis, the scheme has been praised across the UK and also by foreign observers. Falling wage growth The second significant release in for Average Hourly Earnings in April. Wages used to be all the rage in the pre-pandemic era when they were seen as indicating future inflation. While inflation is out of vogue, higher wages indicate more spending, while deceleration in salary growth implies a slower recovery pace. After total earnings, including bonuses, dropped from 3% yearly to 2.4% in March - and a considerable crash is projected now - to only 1.4% in April. That would send them back to levels last seen in October 2014. Excluding bonuses, a marginally more moderate fall from 2.7% to 1.9% is projected. Nevertheless, a sub-2% yearly increase rate is far from being encouraging. What about the unemployment rate? The furlough scheme has likely kept it below 5% - an increase from 3.9% in March to 4.5% in April is on the cards. As the data is lagging, only a surprise to unchartered territory would have an impact. GBP/USD Reaction A significant move in pound/dollar depends on a clear message from the data. If claims rise less than expected - fewer than 300,000 for example - and wages hold up and don't fall by a full percentage point, sterling has room to rise. It would paint a more optimistic picture of both April and May. On the other hand, a leap of over 400,000 jobless applications and salary rises grinding down to 1% would already serve as a one-two-punch for the pound. What happens if the statistics go in separate directions? That depends on the sentiment toward sterling. The thinking about Brexit has received a dose of optimism after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believes there is a "very good"chance of securing a trade deal with the EU by year-end. On the other hand, there are few reports of progress in talks. The same applies to the broader market mood - fears of a second US coronavirus wave may keep the dollar bid while optimism about a vaccine would boost the greenback. If the trend is pound-positive, mixed figures would likely result in a higher pound, while a depressing mood would send it down in the immediate aftermath. Conclusion UK jobs figures have the capacity to move the pound, but they need to go in the same direction. The full GBP/USD response - especially if the statistics offset each other - depends on the market mood around the publication.

Qatar Airways will slash some pilots' salaries and make others redundant to offset the revenue collapse caused by the novel coronavirus travel crisis, it said in a memo seen by AFP Monday.
 The Gulf airline, which flew to more than 170 destinations with 234 aircraft as of March, has been hit by airport closures and travel bans imposed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 disease.
 The International Air Transport Association warned in April that air traffic in the Middle East and North Africa would plummet by more than half this year.
 Qatar Airways' most senior pilots "will be subjected to a 25 percent reduction" in salaries, chief flight operations officer Jassim al-Haroon wrote to pilots in a memo dated June 4.
 "In the upcoming weeks many of our captains, senior first officers, first officers and cadet pilots will be made redundant," Haroon wrote, without specifying how many would be let go.
 More junior pilots will face an immediate 15 percent cut to their salaries, although the measures will not be applied to the airline's Qatari pilots, the memo added.
 The airline warned cabin crew at the start of May that they faced "substantial" job losses.
 At the worst point of the novel coronavirus travel crisis, the airline had to slash its passenger services to just 35 destinations. It has since begun to resume some mothballed routes.
 The economy of super-wealthy gas exporter Qatar has been buffeted by the global economic downturn and associated energy price collapse caused by the pandemic.

Local authorities in northwest Syria are replacing the plummeting Syrian pound with the Turkish lira to shield their opposition-held region from economic collapse, an official said Monday.
 The Salvation Government -- an administrative body linked to the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham jihadist group which dominates the Idlib region -- already started paying wages and salaries in Turkish lira last month, said Bassel Abdul Aziz, who heads its economy department.
 He said it has "instructed commercial traders and money exchange houses" to circulate low-denomination Turkish coins and banknotes to be used "for everyday transactions in liberated territories instead of the Syrian pound".
 At a money transfer office in the province on Sunday, an AFP correspondent saw bags of Turkish lira coins on the floor alongside boxes filled with bank notes.
 In a statement on Friday, the United Nations said a "large" shipment of Turkish currency had reportedly entered Idlib on June 11.
 Syria's economy has been battered by nine years of war compounded by a financial crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, which had served as a conduit to bring dollars into government-held areas.
 The value of the Syrian pound has plummeted in recent days on the informal market, sending prices skyrocketing, shuttering shops and sparking rare anti- government protests in the country's regime-held south.
 At one point last week, the pound sank to 3,000 to the dollar, more than four times the official rate of around 700, and 60 times its pre-2011 rate.
 The spike comes ahead of the introduction of new US sanctions from June 17, and after the sudden fall from grace of tycoon and cousin of the president, Rami Makhlouf, that has left other top businessmen on edge.
 "The Syrian pound will continue to circulate in liberated areas but its use will be reduced to a minimum," the local official said.
 Under the new measures, the Salvation Government last week set the price for a loaf of bread at two Turkish lira (less than $1).
 An AFP correspondent said that gas stations on Sunday started to list their prices in Turkish lira.
 Idlib is held by jihadist and rebel groups, many of them backed by Turkey, one of the main foreign protagonists in Syria's war.
 Ankara has deployed forces in several military posts it established in Idlib as part of a 2018 deal with regime ally Moscow.
 Turkey also controls a stretch of territory along its border in neighbouring Aleppo province following a series of military offensives since 2016.
 In these areas, the lira is already being used as the main currency instead of the Syrian pound in a sign of Ankara's growing influence.

Last month, the couple announced they had decided to end their relationship. "We have lovingly and carefully taken the time we have needed to arrive at our decision to separate," they said in a joint statement. "We share an abundance of love and respect for one another and will continue to lead with our hearts from that place. We kindly request your compassion and respect for our privacy moving forward."
 A source close to the former couple told _PEOPLE_ that things had been "over for a while" between the two, but they had decided to "call it what it is." The two had quarantined separately amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Hough remaining in Los Angeles and Laich waiting things out in his cabin in Idaho. Despite that, the source said there was "honestly no ill will," and that while the pair had decided to split, they still love one another and always will.
 Since their wedding in 2017, the source added that Hough is a "deeply different person than she was," and is "proud" of the changes she had made. "He is the man he is and he shouldn't change a thing. But they shouldn't spend the rest of their lives together -- not as spouses, anyway," they continued, adding that the two are on the same page about that shift in their relationship. After months trying to arrive on that page, they added the pair are "hoping to move forward as deeply loving friends forever who will always be supportive and encouraging of one another."

The West Indies are showing signs that they are developing a pace attack that could stand comparison with the great Caribbean sides of the past, assistant coach Roddy Estwick said on Monday.
 The West Indies were world cricket's dominant team from the mid-1970s to the 1990s when they could call on a succession of superb fast bowlers including Michael Holding, Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh.
 Their quicks also played a key role when the West Indies beat England 2-1 in the Caribbean last year.
 Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel, Alzarri Joseph and captain Jason Holder are all in the Caribbean tour party for the Test series in England.
 The squad are quarantining in Manchester because of the coronavirus as they prepare for the three-match series, which starts next month.
 Estwick said the West Indies were "beginning to get blessed with fast bowlers again" but urged against premature comparisons with earlier generations.
 "We've got four fast bowlers we think can challenge any team in the world," he said in a conference call.
 "I don't know about living up to the greats, they've got to forge their own identity."
 "We've (also) got a group of youngsters coming through," he added, citing Chemar Holder and Oshane Thomas.
 Estwick, a former Barbados paceman, said the new crop of were showing the stamina displayed by previous generations.
 "What we've done is improve our fitness," he said. "Now you can sustain pressure. If you look back at the 80s, that's one thing the fast bowlers had."
 The West Indies also had formidable strength in depth in their golden era.
 "When I played first-class cricket in the 80s, we had six outstanding fast bowlers," recalled Estwick.
 "But the likes of Wayne Daniel and Sylvester Clarke only played 10 and 11 Tests and yet they both had about 900 first-class wickets each."
 Next month's series will be played behind closed doors as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19 but Estwick said England new-ball veterans Stuart Broad and James Anderson would be just as dangerous without home support.
 "The '12th man' isn't going to be there but I don't think experienced bowlers like Broad and Anderson will be too fazed by the crowd not being there," he said.
 Estwick said there had been some benefits to the quarantine restrictions.
 "It's a different situation but we've spent a bit more time as a group together. The spirit has been good. We've got no complaints with the way things have gone so far. The excuses stop now."
