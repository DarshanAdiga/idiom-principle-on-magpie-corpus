The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on January 21 carried out searches at 13 locations, including the premises of the present and former directors of Mumbai-based Frost International which has been booked by the agency for allegedly cheating a consortium of 14 banks to the tune of over Rs 3,592 crore, officials said.


  The action has been taken on the complaint of the Kanpur Zonal office of Bank of India (BOI), which alleged that the directors had worked under the guise of undertaking merchanting trade without genuine business, they said.


  This is understood to be the biggest default reported by public sector banks to the CBI after January 2018 when Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi fled the nation causing a loss of over Rs 13,000 crore to the Punjab National Bank.

"Forever and Always"      In loving memory of James Carr Hughes      James, life-long resident of Frederick, Maryland, died unexpectedly on January 16, 2020, at the age of 27. He was battling a virus that caused an arrhythmia in his heart and ultimately cardiac arrest. He was a beloved son, brother, partner, father, and friend.      James is survived by fiance, Kayla Lissette; children, Arianna Lucie, Oliver James, and Elias Alexander Hughes; mother, Terri Carr; father, Mark Hughes; sister, Michele (and Joshua) Rudnicki; brother, Nicholas (and Justine) Hughes and niece, Emily Elisabeth; grandparents, James and Margaret Hughes and Norman Carr; as well as many beloved aunts, uncles, cousins and friends, for whom he was incredibly grateful. Additionally, he treasured his relationship and time spent with Kayla's parents, Tito and Sonia Castell, and their extended family. James was preceded in death by grandmother, Elaine Carr.      James was born in Frederick on July 2, 1992, and graduated from Tuscarora High School in 2010. He worked hard in various educational and vocational endeavors before finding his niche and taking pride in his work as an HVAC apprentice.      James welcomed with open arms his three beautiful children and loved each dearly. The love of his life, Kayla, and his children were the most important part of his life, as expressed in one of his many musical creations, "It's All For You." While cherishing the wonder and hope their newborn brought, they looked forward to marriage and their family's future.      As a family man, James loved spending time with all his loved ones, snuggling on the couch with Kayla, and playing with his kids. Making children laugh was one of his favorite things. He was a musician and gifted lyricist. He had a passion for music and recorded many songs while singing and playing his guitar. Food brought him so much joy, especially when shared with family and friends. He had a generous, loving, and grateful heart. His wit had many in stitches at the most random times. James was loved by so many and will be greatly missed.      James made the selfless choice to be an organ donor, and his precious gifts allowed others to live. There is no greater gift than the gift of life, and words cannot describe the impact he's made on this world. With the help of the Living Legacy Foundation, James provided hope to six people who allow his generous and loving spirit to live beyond his short 27 years on this earth.      James' celebration of life will be held Wednesday, January 22, at 6PM. Service begins at 6:30 with reception to follow. FCF Church, North Building, 10142 Hansonville Rd., Frederick, MD 21702.      Flowers and arrangements may be delivered to the church between 9AM and 5PM. Expressions of sympathy may also be made with a contribution to a Go Fund Me page created in his honor to benefit his children. At his service, cards will be available to share sentiments and fond memories, especially "James-isms" that capture his hilarious and goofy wit. They will be included later in a memory book.

NEW YORK -- Risk assets took a hit across the globe on Tuesday while the Japanese yen and some developed country bond prices gained as financial markets reacted to mounting concern about a new strain of flu-like virus in China.            Authorities in China confirmed the coronavirus could spread through human contact. The mayor of Wuhan, where the virus may have originated, confirmed a sixth virus-related death. The World Health Organization called a meeting for Wednesday to consider declaring a global health emergency.            Investors worried that about the threat of contagion, as hundreds of millions travel for the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, which peak over the coming weekend.            Emerging market stocks lost 1.59 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.63 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.91 percent.            Hong Kong, which suffered badly during the SARS outbreak, saw its index fall 2.8%.            The chill in Asia carried over to European markets. Shares of luxury goods makers - which have large exposure to China - were among those declining the most.            A U.S. index of airline stocks fell 2.1% and hotel and casino operators Las Vegas Sands Corp and Wynn Resorts Ltd, both of which have large operations in China, dropped about 5%.            The virus outbreak "seems to be the biggest negative," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. "We may see U.S. markets try to spit it out because it doesn't have that much of an impact on U.S. economy."            The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 64.41 points, or 0.22 percent, to 29,283.69, the S&P 500 lost 5.41 points, or 0.16 percent, to 3,324.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.30 points, or 0.02 percent, to 9,386.65.            The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.32 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.36 percent.            In other markets, U.S.- and German 10-year government bond yields touched a two week low while the safe-haven yen strengthened 0.26 percent versus the dollar at 109.92.            Some recalled the fallout from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003 that China initially covered up.            "The fear is that it could be a SARS-type event, which was an economic issue," said Ellis Phifer, market strategist at Raymond James in Tennessee. "But this is all cautionary. The market is not panicking or anything."            Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 19/32 in price to yield 1.7708 percent, from 1.835 percent late on Friday. Monday was a U.S. market holiday.            The dollar index fell 0.08 percent, with the euro up 0.02 percent to $1.1096.            Sterling was last trading at $1.3059, up 0.38 percent on the day.            The Australian dollar dropped on the flu worries since the country attracts large numbers of Chinese tourists, who tend to be big spenders over the Lunar New Year holidays.            Some investors were relieved that U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron seemed to have struck a truce over a proposed digital tax. They agreed to hold off on a potential tariffs war until the end of the year, a French diplomatic source said.            U.S. gold futures fell 0.17 percent to $1,557.60 an ounce.            Oil prices fell on expectations that a well-supplied market would be able to absorb disruptions that have cut Libya's crude production to a trickle.            U.S. crude fell 0.34 percent to $58.34 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.82, down 0.58 percent on the day.

Here at GamesNeighdar--sorry, Games _Radar_ --we're always a fan of something that takes a left-turn before Normalsville and just goes and does something we've never seen before. Horse Girl, a new Netflix movie starring Alison Brie, takes things to a whole other level.


  The trailer (which you can watch above) starts off as a normal rom-com and rapidly turns into a twisting conspiracy complete with horses and alien abductions - and it only gets stranger from there.


  Alison Brie - maintaining stable equine-centric work with Netflix in both BoJack Horseman and now Horse Girl - stars as mild-mannered art-and-craft store worker Sarah, who appears to get lucky in love with friend-of-a-friend, Darren. After a life filled with low-energy Zumba and trips to her mother's grave, she's suddenly peppy and happy again. So far, so normal - girl meets boy and the two live happily ever after, right?


  Wrong. So very, very wrong. Because the nosebleeds start. And the trailer begins to awkwardly loop. Then Sarah mentions aliens. Yes, _aliens_. Horse Girl suddenly becomes anything but your safe Netflix comedy that you wouldn't ordinarily give a second look at; it turns into a melting pot of all your favourite sci-fi shows, part-Fringe, part-OA, 100% bonkers. You'll no doubt have your own theories by the time the trailer reaches its end. And questions. So. Many. Questions.


  Is Sarah her own grandmother? How can she hear the future? Does she - oh god, no - turn into a horse at night, giving Horse Girl the most unfortunately literal movie title in the history of movie titles? If nothing else, it's a trailer that you'll want to tell all your friends about right away. But pro tip: let them find out the mid-trailer twist for themselves. They can thank you later.


  Horse Girl gallops on to Netflix from February 7.

The plant-based meat industry has had a number of major wins recently with climbing consumer demand and numerous restaurant partnerships. But there are real challenges in growing it from this honeymoon phase into something that has the scale and market power to truly transform the global meat industry. The most fundamental obstacle to this growth lies in the way we make plant-based meat today. Today’s plant-based meat production is so inefficient, it’s akin to riding a horse for transportation. To improve transportation, we didn’t just need to build a stronger, mechanical horse. We had to reimagine the process and the machinery in its entirety. In the same way, we need to engineer a new, highly efficient approach to plant-based meat production if we want to reach a scale on par with the conventional meat industry. Rebellyous exists to tackle this fundamental problem by designing optimized production machinery and processes. In five years, we would like to be outfitting our flagship production facility, which will implement all of the prototypes we’re developing in our current headquarters to eventually produce 18 million pounds of plant-based meat per year. And if you look at conventional meat industry production stats, you’ll know that’s just the beginning! We’re not just here to produce another product. We’re here to go the distance and bring about the scale that everyone in this industry wants to achieve.

Clinton said the argument between Sanders and Warren about whether or not he said a woman could be elected is "part of a pattern."            "If it were a one-off, you might say, 'OK, fine.' But he said I was unqualified. I had a lot more experience than he did, and got a lot more done than he had, but that was his attack on me," she said.            Clinton again warned that people need to pay attention so the elected president is one who brings us together, "not either turn a blind eye, or actually reward the kind of insulting, attacking, demeaning, degrading behavior that we've seen from this current administration."             Sanders responded to Clinton in a statement, saying, "My focus today is on a monumental moment in American history: the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Together, we are going to go forward and defeat the most dangerous president in American history."            In the documentary and the THR interview, Clinton opened up on a number of other topics, including the women running for president in 2020 and why President Trump is even "worse" than she anticipated.

_Calls for governments to clamp down on companieswho use tax havens to pay lower taxes on their profits have been growing louder over the past year. Apple, Facebook and Amazon have been in the firing line for not paying taxes in the countries where their economic activity is generated. France became the first Western country to approve a new digital tax that would hit large American tech companies like Google, with the Trump administration threatening tariffs against imported French goods including wine if they go ahead with implementation. The United Kingdom also announced a tax of 2% on new digital services.

And in the years since, they haven’t been fully optimized to excel in this new task.

Despite these limitations, food extruders can carry a price tag of almost two million dollars for a single unit, severely restricting the production capabilities of startups in the sector.

Today, the cost of production for the typical soy nugget is around 75% greater than the cost of production for a conventional chicken nugget. Manufacturing, labor, and electricity are the primary drivers of this, which is why those are the exact factors we’re targeting for cost reduction. A lack of specialized equipment and built-in efficiencies keep these costs high and stagnant. With our optimized production tech running at scale, we have determined that we can slash those costs by about half to finally produce plant-based meat slightly more cheaply than factory farmed meat. While we’re not there yet – we’re still in the early stages of developing our new processes – we can already sell Rebellyous Nuggets at the same cost as plant-based brands that have been around for decades.

On a holiday set aside to honor King, and in the week in which the Senate is set to begin its impeachment trial of Trump, Conway's criticism of the latter event marked one of the White House's few commemorations of the former.


  During a news conference, NBC News correspondent Geoff Bennett asked Conway why the president's public schedule of events on Monday did not include any functions meant to commemorate King. In response, Conway argued that impeachment went against the ideals that King had put forth.


  "The president ... agrees with many of the things that Dr. Martin Luther King stood for and agreed with for many years, including unity and equality," she said. "He's not the one tearing the country apart through an impeachment process and a lack of substance that really is very shameful at this point."


  Her comments were immediately ridiculed as one of the most bizarre attacks on the impeachment process to date.


  Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, called the remark an "embarrassingly incompetent answer." Trump, she suggested, has in fact strayed far from King's legacy - by redefining the presidency and pushing it away from leadership.


  "He just gets to tweet whatever he wants that he thinks will put him in a better political position," she said on MSNBC. "We don't need Mr. Trump to lead us in knowing what to do around equality and justice."


  On Twitter, later in the afternoon, Trump noted that Martin Luther King Jr. Day was the three-year anniversary of his inauguration and an "appropriate" occasion to point out low unemployment numbers for African Americans. (A Washington Post-Ipsos poll last week found that most black Americans don't believe he deserves credit for those economic successes.)


  "So appropriate that today is also MLK jr DAY. African-American Unemployment is the LOWEST in the history of our Country, by far," Trump said on Twitter. "Also, best Poverty, Youth, and Employment numbers, ever. Great!"


  Yet Trump, who was sued in the 1970s for housing discrimination against blacks, has not fared much better in office: He has been largely panned by black Americans, an overwhelming majority of whom say they think he is a racist and has made racism a larger problem in the United States.

Urs Brunner wiederum, Gründer und Inhaber der Unternehmensgruppe Brunner, deren Kern die Baugesellschaft Brunner + Co darstellt, will in der Maximilianstraße, direkt gegenüber der Oper, ein eigenes Gourmetrestaurant einrichten. Viel mehr als Standort und Küchenchef sind davon noch nicht bekannt. Das nötige Kleingeld dürfte vorhanden sein. Brunner kaufte vor vier Jahren dem Augsburger Immobilienunternehmen Patrizia die Praterinsel ab. Der Kaufpreis blieb damals ein Geheimnis; kolportiert wurde die Summe von 50 Millionen Euro.


  Brunner baute an der Hauptverwaltung der Stadtwerke mit, an der Generalverwaltung der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft und am Münchner Technologiezentrum, eines seiner Prestigeobjekte ist die Sanierung der Maximilianstraße 6, einem Bauwerk des Architekten Friedrich Bürklein aus dem Jahr 1863, hinter dessen denkmalgeschützter, historischer Fassade mit großem Aufwand 18 Meter in die Tiefe gebaut wurde und letztlich elf neue Ebenen eingezogen wurden.


  Dort soll nun schon im Februar oder März ein Bistro eröffnen, als Vorläufermodell des späteren Gourmetrestaurants, das dann im September eröffnen wird - sofern alles im Zeitplan bleibt. Chefkoch Christian Schagerl war bislang für nähere Auskünfte nicht zu erreichen. Der 33-jährige gebürtige Österreicher aus St. Pölten hat jedenfalls schon viel Erfahrung in der Sternegastronomie. Unter anderem arbeitete er in den Drei-Sterne-Restaurants von Klaus Erfort in Saarbrücken und Christian Jürgens in Rottach-Egern, bei Heinz Winkler in Aschau (zwei Sterne) war er Sous-Chef. Seine erste Chefkoch- Stelle im Berliner Richard krönte er 2017 gleich mit einem Michelin-Stern. Diesen Erfolg wiederholte er im Münchner Tian. Die vegetarische Küche ist übrigens keineswegs sein Spezialgebiet, er selbst antwortet auf die Frage nach seinem Lieblingsgericht schon mal lakonisch: "Gulasch."


  Eine schriftliche Anfrage der SZ an Urs Brunner zu seinen Gastro-Plänen blieb bislang unbeantwortet. Auf telefonische Nachfrage hieß es aus seinem Büro lediglich, man sei mit den Planungen noch nicht weit genug, um schon Näheres bekanntgeben zu können.

“I believe that would be wrong course of action. If the files related to “Services” are placed before Hon’ble LG and Hon’ble LG acts on them, it would clearly amount to contempt of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the light of the aforesaid judgment. (sic),” Mr. Kejriwal wrote to the LG.


  Mr. Kejriwal added that though the notification had not been quashed, it had become “infructuous” in the light of Wednesday’s judgment. He informed the LG that the government would issue orders to “all functionaries” on the implementation of the judgment on Friday.


  Later, in a tweet, Mr. Kejriwal said officers should “respect and obey” the judgment.


  “...Open defiance of SC order shall invite serious consequences. It will be in noone’s interest (sic),” he said.


  The Raj Niwas continued to maintain silence, not responding to requests for comment for the second day.


  ## 'A presumption'


  In his post, Mr. Jaitley termed it a “presumption” by the Delhi government that the apex court’s judgment had given it administrative powers over Union Territory (UT) cadre officers, a presumption, he said, was “wholly erroneous”.


  “It [the judgment] emphasises the importance of elected state government, but Delhi being a union territory makes its powers subservient to the Central government,” he said.


  There are several issues that had directly not been commented upon, but by implication there was some indication of those issues, Mr Jaitley said, adding that unless issues of importance were flagged, discussed and a specific opinion was rendered, “none can assume that silence implies an opinion in favour of one or the other”.


  There were two obvious indications, Mr Jaitley said, adding firstly that if Delhi had no police powers, it “cannot set up” an investigative agency to investigate crimes as had been done in the past.


  “Secondly, the Supreme Court has held categorically that Delhi cannot compare itself on a par with other States and, therefore, any presumption that the administration of the UT cadre of services has been decided in favour of the Delhi government would be wholly erroneous,” he said.


  “It has been specifically held by the Supreme Court that it is crystal clear that by no stretch of imagination, NCT of Delhi can be accorded the status of a State under the present constitutional scheme and the status of the Lieutenant Governor is not that of a governor of a state, rather he remains an administrator, in a limited sense, working with the designation of lieutenant governor,” he said.


  The court, Mr Jaitley said, has “rightly observed that all the three institutions, the elected government, the LG and the Central government must work in harmony keeping the interest of the people and the national capital in mind.”


  “Cooperation, operating in their respective constitutional space and not confrontation should be the objective,” he said.

Reading the title of this column you might think it is an advertisement for the sale of a long term care insurance policy. It isn't. In fact, it is just the opposite. Much of what follows is very personal with me, perhaps too personal to be published in newspapers across the country. Too bad. Readers need to be aware of some of the hazards related to long-term care insurance policies. Let the insurance folks sue. As a boxing commentator used to say, "I tell it like it is."      On the national level we talk a lot about universal insurance coverage, the next generation after Obamacare. We all need to remember that insurance companies are in the business of taking in premiums. Unfortunately, they are exceedingly adept at not paying out claims. The end result for people who need help from their insurance companies to handle the ever higher prices for medical services is a constant fight to get some of their money back when insurance coverage is needed.      Twenty years ago when my wife and I were approaching 60 years of age we made what we thought was a prudent decision to help cover future necessities for health care as we aged. We bought a long-term care plan for each of us. The cost? We have paid the carrier approximately $220 a month for almost two decades. If you are counting that is approaching $40,000.      Today, we need their help. My wife has stage 4 cancer that she has been fighting for almost two years. We could use the long-term care coverage we have been paying for. Unfortunately, they say she does not meet the requirements in the fine print of the policy. As is generally true, the devil is in the details and the details are in the fine print. There is a cover sheet that says whenever the doctor testifies that she meets their necessities we will have 90 days to wait before payments can begin. That is pretty standard and my signature is at the bottom of the page where the 90-day waiting period is noted. The monthly coverage is $135, not quite enough to cover a monthly rate at a local assisted living unit but enough to be helpful.      What is not there and is nowhere I can find on any document with my signature on it is the requirement that my wife be unable to feed or dress herself prior to applying for the coverage. I am sure I didn't agree to that but it is certainly in the fine print that they have sent me to justify their decision not to begin payments. Reason tells me that such a requirement makes no sense. By the time a person cannot feed or dress herself, one can assume that the end will not be long in coming. In many communities, Hospice, a free service, will have stepped in with their services and taken over helping take the person toward their end.      So, did I do a dumb thing 20 years ago and agree to pay $40,000 for something that is simply not feasible? I don't think so, but proof is not on my side. They have the money and the lawyers to fight whatever resistance they receive from me.      So, what is the solution to my problem? In truth, there may not be one. My purpose for writing this column is to warn those who don't have such policies not to buy and those who do to read the fine print. A good alternative is to take the amount that the policy costs and put it in the bank each month in a savings account. When you need it, perhaps 30 years down the road, it will be there for your use and you will not have to fight with anyone to get the help you need.   You can reach Dr. Mark L.

One of my favorite holiday movies is "Home Alone." In the 1990 comedy, the McCallister family is planning a trip to Paris for the holidays, but oversleeps on the morning of their departure, which causes havoc. In their rush leave, the family accidentally forgets their youngest child, 8-year-old Kevin, and leave him home alone.      Chances are, you've seen the movie and you probably know the antics that ensue as Kevin protects the family's Chicago home from burglars.      But a scene I've always loved is the one of the large family rushing through the airport and barely making it on the plane. They get settled and after the plane takes off, the mother gasps "KEVIN!"      Now, I've never forgotten a child at home while on vacation, thank God. Vacations are stressful enough.      And while I've always loved the scene of the family rushing through the airport, trying to get to the gate on time, it's recently occurred to me how simpler things must have been for airline passengers in a pre-9/11 world.      The McAllister family obviously wasn't delayed by security. They didn't have to take off their shoes and their jackets. They didn't have to go through a full body scan machine. You don't see Kevin's family dragging carry-on size suitcases through the terminal in their rush for the gate. Today, the cost of checked luggage is so high, but back then then it was free.      And chances are, the parents didn't have to worry about what food options there were in that terminal because in 1990 most flights still provided food other than pretzels. (Although, I suppose, a transcontinental flight to Europe still provides meals.)      Last month, my family of five flew to California for New Year's. It was part family vacation - we took the kids to Disneyland and the San Diego Zoo. But it was a serious trip too, as we finally had a memorial service for our dad and spread some of his ashes at sea. We also finished emptying out the family home of the last 50 years.      We spent every second of that trip trying to make memories and enjoy the time with the kids, which meant the last day was rushed. Thirty minutes after our original "leave" time for the airport, I was still trying to cram everything into our carry-on size suitcases.      There were five of us, including our 10, 8 and 4-year-old kids. And there were six suitcases, five which were carry-on size (I'm not paying a fortune to check suitcases), three backpacks, a purse, my grandmother's ashes in an urn and a Star Wars robot from Disneyland. We looked like a herd of bogged-down camels, rushing to get to the airport.      Despite leaving later than planned, we returned the rental car and got to the terminal in decent time. We exited the rental car shuttle, entered an elevator that took us to the ticketing section of Terminal 4 at LAX airport, and then headed for the American Airlines desk. When we got to the self-help kiosk to get our boarding passes, I stopped to count my children. There were two - but we have three children.      "Where's Eliza?" I asked my two oldest kids, referring to their 4-year-old little sister. They shrugged. I asked my husband, in panic, "Where's Eliza?" He looked at our kids, then looked down the terminal where we had just dragged all of our belongings.      I shouted. "ELIZA?!?" which reverberated against the terminal's two-story ceilings. People turned around to look. I shouted again. My husband then dropped the bags and ran.      I told our older kids not to move and to stay with the bags, and then also ran down the ticketing hall, shouting Eliza's name.      She wasn't even in the building.      She was only gone a couple of minutes at most. A kind stranger saw my panicked husband and pointed him outside, where our scared pre-schooler stood on the sidewalk outside the airport next to the traffic. An airline attendant noticed our daughter all alone and was holding her hand. For that, I am so grateful.      Apparently, when we boarded the elevator as we first entered the airport, there were two doors, one that led inside the airport, and the other, which led back outside. As we exited the elevator toward the ticketing hall inside LAX, our daughter thought we were going back outside, and had walked through the wrong door.      Unlike "Home Alone" it was no comedy situation. It will probably be one of those moments I'll tell my grandkids about one day, the time we lost a kid in LAX. Hopefully by then we'll be able to laugh about it. For now, I'm still trying to calm my nerves.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

While long-term kits provide a better determination of radon exposure averaged over different seasons and home conditions, I half-wondered, knowing my memory, how likely I’d recall placing a test kit 8 or 12 months down the road, or recognize the unfamiliar object in my basement!


  I double-checked expiration dates stamped on the short-term kits and bought three.


  While recommendations advise placing kits on the lowest occupied level of the home, I put two in my basement (though not technically used as living space) where concentrations are likely highest, and one on the first floor.


  Given that kits should be returned to the lab within four days of test completion, I opted to sample Saturday morning to Monday afternoon and ship the samples overnight, instead of taking a chance on the predicted 3-day first class shipping. Considering how affordable the tests were, I didn’t mind this expense.


  Collecting samples was simple and convenient as removing screw-on lids from the small labeled vials, placing them in locations a minimum two feet above floors and three feet from windows and walls, away from moving air, and waiting.
