Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus and thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of the virus “immediately,.”   But in fact, Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines. Strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame, The Associated Press has found from internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews.   Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on Jan 11. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January — all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.   Although WHO continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time.   “We’re currently at the stage where yes, they’re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” said WHO’s top official in China, Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting.   The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. US President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world “in a most timely fashion.”   The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the UN agency has no enforcement powers. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of member states.   The AP has found rather than colluding with China, WHO was itself largely kept in the dark, as China gave it only the minimal information required. But the agency did attempt to portray China in the best light, most likely to coax the country into providing more outbreak details.   WHO officials worried about how to press China for more information without angering authorities or jeopardizing Chinese scientists, whom they praised for decoding the genome with astonishing speed. Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said the best way to “protect China” was for WHO to do its own independent analysis, because otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question and “other countries will take action accordingly.”   From the time the virus was first decoded on Jan. 2 to when WHO declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, the outbreak grew by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to retrospective Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention data.   WHO and officials named in this story declined to answer questions asked by the AP without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply to protect its sources.   “Our leadership and staff have worked night and day….to support and share information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels,” a WHO statement said.   China’s National Health Commission and Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no comment. But in the past few months, China has repeatedly defended its actions, and many other countries — including the US — have responded to the virus with even longer delays of weeks and even months.   In late December, doctors noticed mysterious clusters of patients with unusual pneumonia. Seeking answers, they sent samples to commercial labs. By Dec. 27, one company, Vision Medicals, had pieced together most of the genome of a new virus with striking similarities to SARS. They alerted Wuhan officials, who, days later, issued internal notices warning of the unusual pneumonia.   On Dec. 30, Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was alerted to the disease, and by Jan. 2, her team had fully decoded it.   But when it came to sharing the genome with the world, things went awry. China’s top medical authority, the National Health Commission, issued a confidential notice forbidding labs from publishing about the virus without authorization. The order barred Shi’s lab from publishing the sequence or warning of the possible danger.   Commission officials later said the order was to prevent any accidental release of the then-unknown pathogen, and to ensure consistent results by giving it to four state labs to identify at the same time.   By Jan. 5, two other government labs sequenced the virus, and another lab in Shanghai led by Zhang Yongzhen had also decoded it. Zhang warned the National Health Commission the virus was “likely infectious.” The Chinese CDC raised its emergency level to the second highest, but did not have the authority to alert the public.   Suspicious cases starting surfacing across the region. In Thailand, airport officials pulled aside a woman traveling from Wuhan with a runny nose, sore throat and high temperature. Scientists at Chulalongkorn University soon figured out she was infected with a new coronavirus, but did not have a sequence from China to match it.   WHO officials, meanwhile, grumbled in internal meetings that China was stalling on providing crucial outbreak details even though it was technically meeting its obligations under international law. Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said it was time to “shift gears” and push for more information.   “The danger now is that despite our good intent...there will be a lot of finger-pointing at WHO if something does happen,” he said.   On Jan. 11, Shanghai’s Zhang finally published the coronavirus sequence ahead of health authorities on virological.org, used by researchers to swap tips on pathogens. It was only then that the Chinese CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences raced to publish their sequences, doing so on Jan. 12.   On Jan. 20, Chinese authorities warned the virus spread between people. WHO dispatched a small team to Wuhan from its Asia offices. China representative Galea told colleagues the Chinese were “talking openly and consistently about human-to-human transmission.”   WHO’s emergency committee of independent experts met twice that week and decided against recommending an emergency. But the agency’s concern prompted an unusual trip to Beijing by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and top scientists.   At the end of Tedros’ trip, WHO convened another emergency meeting, finally declaring a global emergency on Jan. 30. Tedros thanked China profusely, declining to mention any of WHO’s earlier frustrations.   “We should have actually expressed our respect and gratitude to China for what it’s doing,” he said. “It has already done incredible things to limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.”   ___   Contact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected]

It repeatedly thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of the virus “immediately,” and said its work and commitment to transparency were “very impressive, and beyond words.”
 But behind the scenes, it was a much different story, one of significant delays by China and considerable frustration among WHO officials over not getting the information they needed to fight the spread of the deadly virus, The Associated Press has found.
 Despite the plaudits, China in fact sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different government labs had fully decoded the information. Tight controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were to blame, according to dozens of interviews and internal documents.

“A billionaire? With a ‘B’?” Woodhouse recalled asking him.
 But if Woodhouse had any qualms about digging in on defense against various titans of industry, he quickly learned that everyone was competitive.
 “If you’re not playing defense, they’re going to call you out,” said Woodhouse, who would temper his Friday night activities in anticipation of The Run. “If I’m 25 and struggling to get up and down the court because I was out with my friends, and these guys who are running companies are showing up and playing ball, then I have no excuse. It became such a healthy place to be.”
 The Run also often doubles as a day care. If you lose, that might mean you need to keep an eye on several of your friends’ toddlers. Back when the Feigins’ (now teenage) sons were much younger, Lasry suspected that Peter Feigin or Dan Feigin would give them a secret signal to scamper onto the floor if their team was losing.
 “That’s just my view,” Lasry said. “But I could swear by the 10th time it happened, it was not an accident.”
 More recently, Tom Kearns, a mental health counselor and one of The Run’s longtime staples, has been bringing his 12-year-old daughter, Sophia, so she can shoot hoops on the side with Dan Feigin’s 12-year-old daughter, Dylan. Afterward, a big group heads to City Diner on Broadway for brunch.
 “It’s really a family,” Kearns said.
 In all, about 100 players have played in The Run over the decades, some more luminous than others. When Lee was shooting his film “The Best Man,” he brought actors Taye Diggs and Morris Chestnut to the gym. Lasry, who has been active in Democratic Party politics, has invited various campaign staffers. And everyone was thrilled when Keefe showed up.
 “We love good players,” Dan Feigin said.
 But no matter how skilled the player, new members are included on a probationary basis.
 “Sometimes it goes up for judicial review to make sure The Run is harmonious,” Lee said. “Do we want this guy to keep playing? Does he pass enough? Does he play defense?”
 And if a new player does not endear himself to the group, it tends to reflect poorly on whoever invited him in the first place.
 “That’s a stain on your career,” Dan Feigin said.
 Before life as we knew it went on hiatus in March, Peter Feigin was occasionally returning to New York from Milwaukee for weekend visits — and to rejoin The Run, which has become multigenerational. Peter’s son, Thomas, and Dan’s son, Jackson, are both high school juniors and excellent players. They cause matchup problems for their fathers’ friends.
 “Being able to play ball with your son is kind of like the best of the best,” Peter Feigin said. “It’s like winning the life lottery.”
 Now, the lockdown has forced some of The Run’s long-standing members to confront their athletic mortality. Lasry, 60, had already become less of a regular presence in recent years. “As you get older, it’s just harder to keep up with everybody,” he said.

Gary Gene Godwin      1957 – 2020   Gary Gene Godwin passed away peacefully on May 18, 2020 at home with family after a two-year battle with kidney cancer. He was 63 year old.   Gary was born January 7, 1957 to Harvey and Jewell Godwin. He attended Morris Elementary. At an early age, he met his lifetime friend Kent Bettendorf. They spent many days, riding bikes, fishing, playing Little League baseball, and catching butterflies for their collection. They even tried catching bees only to find out Kent was allergic to them.   Gary attended McKinleyville High School where he played basketball and ran track. He enjoyed a good card game of poker with his buddies. He spent some summers fishing in Alaska, where his parents lived. He graduated from McKinleyville High School in 1975 and went on to attend College of the Redwoods. He was always curious and had a thirst for knowledge about everything.   Gary met Julie Bonnell in 1983 and married her on August 16, 1986. They enjoyed their 36 years traveling to places like Hawaii, Mexico, Germany, Alaska and the Caribbean Islands, to name a few. They also enjoyed their home and always had a project going on. Summers were spent at Trinity Lake camping and boating with family and friends. Each year they would take a trip to Rita and Dave's farm in Tillamook, where there was never a dull moment and many good memories. It was Garrett's favorite place to go.   After high school, Gary took up golf and loved the game. He would play rain or shine until he got older and became a fair weather golfer. He had many friends at the golf course that he enjoyed spending time with. Always ready to play in any tournament they had. He organized a yearly golf tournament at Bandon Crossing in Oregon. Gary loved that trip and spent many hours planning so that it would be perfect.   Gary also enjoyed telling a story about backpacking in the Trinity Alp's with his twin brother Terry, when they were younger. Later he expanded trips to include his son Garrett and nephews. Gary and his family enjoyed camping and boating on Trinity Lake and Whiskeytown with Friends. Everybody loved the evening around the campfire with him telling his Johnny Jokes. No one can tell a Johnny Joke like Gary. He also liked telling scary stories to all his nieces and nephews. He mentored his nephews: Gabe, Joe, Jeff, Luke, and Tyler, getting them summer work when they were young and welcoming the out of town boys to live with his family during those summers. He also spent time coaching Garrett's basketball teams when he was young and also being president of Little League.   Gary worked at Miller Farms for 45 years. There he was the Manager of the Power Equipment Shop. When he started there they only had two lines of power equipment and over the years he worked really hard to add the many lines of products they sell today. That was something he was very proud of. He also became friends when many of the customers over the years and told them, "I will give you a really good deal."   There were many great things about him. He loved his family very much and always had time for them. He was so very proud of his son Garrett for the man he has become. He always had a smile and loved talking and laughing with people. He seemed to know everyone. Gary could fix anything and was always there to help his friends with whatever they needed. He will be greatly missed.   Gary is survived by his wife of 33 years, Julie of McKinleyville; his son Garrett (Jessie & Jaylie) of Redding; mother Jewell of McKinleyville; mother and father-in-law Bill and Darlene Saltsman of Redding; his brothers Ron (Jennifer) of Baker City, OR; Ed and Terry of McKinleyville; Sisters Marilyn Terrell (Ken) of Chico; Rita Hogan (Dave) of Tillamook, OR; brother-in-law Crag Bonnell (Vicki) of Redding; Sister-in law Sue Kessner (Terry) of Redding and many nieces and nephews.   He is preceded in death by his dad Harvey, father-in-law Frank and sister-in- law Jennie.   The family would like to thank the many friends who stopped in to visit Gary during his illness and the phone calls and text messages of support after his passing.   A celebration of life will be held at a later date, when we are able to safely gather again.

Rodriguez said New Season had been planning to return from quarantine Sunday for several weeks. His motives were not as political as those of some ministers, he said — he delivered one of the prayers at President Donald Trump’s inauguration, but likes to say that his parishioners “worship the lamb, not the elephant or the donkey.”
 But he also disapproved of Newsom’s church guidelines, saying the cap on attendance was punitive for a 1,000-seat church like his. Also punitive, he said, was the state’s ban on church singing, a precaution against the airborne spread of the virus.
 Then came the national fury at Floyd’s death.
 On the day before New Season’s service, nearly 1,000 demonstrators wielding Black Lives Matter signs converged on California’s state Capitol. As night fell, crowds swarmed the freeways and the Sacramento Kings’ glistening sports arena, defacing a landmark sculpture by artist Jeff Koons and looting nearby department stores.
 The pain was especially sharp at New Season, where the congregation is 40% black, 40% white and 20% Hispanic. Patricia Littlejohn, a church volunteer, said she had sought to tune out the violence, but that it had evoked painful memories of Clark’s shooting. Coming on top of the pandemic, which cost her job at a health club, she said the unrest left her feeling isolated.
 Gesturing to her fellow congregants, who were trying not to hug even as other volunteers entreated them to keep 7 feet of space between them, Littlejohn smiled. “This,” she said, “means everything.”
 In the front row, Mercedes Ray, a member of the church board, said the explosion of violence compelled churches to act. “What has happened out there is that people feel backed into a corner. They feel they’re not being heard and that nothing has been done.”
 That concern echoed with particular force among African American churchgoers, at the epicenter both of the fury over Floyd’s death and of the toll of the coronavirus. Out of caution, many African American churches held services with pastors preaching to empty sanctuaries and virtual congregations — even on a day when they would have wanted to be together most.
 “I think the church has to help make sure it is a wake-up call,” said the Rev. Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson, the senior pastor at Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, New York, who kept his parish online Sunday.
 “The church has had to be a safety net for a society that has ignored the community,” he said. “It’s like you pull back the covers and saw all the years of inequity and, to some degree, racist disregard for African Americans and people of color.”

The Government's objective is to increase pensions "realistically, on the basis of economic realities", said on Monday night Prime minister Ludovic Orban at the private TV broadcaster Digi24, adding that raising them by 40pct would be "a hot potato, which was prepared in advance by the PSD".
 "We are going to increase pensions. Our objective is to increase pensions as much as we can, in real terms. I can't say right now, what will be the percentage. (...) We will see it after the first six months, in the half- yearly report we make on the state of the economy, taking into account the forecasts. and forecasts not only in Romania, because we must also take into account the forecasts of economic evolution in Europe and the forecasts of evolution of all partners. Because I'm raising pensions for nothing, if I can't pay them. (...) How can I put it, we can do as PSD (Social Democratic Party, opposition, ed. n.), we pretend we raise them, we let go of inflation, which erodes all the purchasing power especially for people on low incomes and we report that we have increased your pensions, on paper, but in fact, when you sit and look what you can buy with that money, you can buy less than you buy before the so-called pension growth," Orban said.

“The racism has been around for a very, very long time," said Lawrence R. Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. “You can see it in the redlining of neighborhoods, the education system, the transportation system and, obviously, policing.”
 Even lifelong residents who brag about their city say that Minneapolis’ friendly exterior masks deep-rooted problems.
 It is not uncommon to hear residents say how much they love the multicultural nature of Minneapolis in one breath, but that they feel threatened because of their race, ethnicity or religion in the next.
 “Racism with a smile” is how Leila Ali, 42, a Somali immigrant who has lived in Minneapolis since 1998, described it.
 As another night of fiery unrest in the Minneapolis streets gave way to a cloudless, picture-perfect Saturday, hundreds of residents, brooms in hand, descended upon a Wells Fargo Bank branch on the South Side that had burned the night before.
 Water from the sprinkler system was flooding out of the building, and people formed channels out of mulch and used brooms to direct the water into drains. Others hauled furniture out of the building so it would not be ruined.
 One resident, Peggy Madden-Olson, 59, who is white, arrived at the cleanup effort with memories of a previous chapter in her city’s history fresh in her mind: In fifth grade, she had to leave her familiar, mostly white South Minneapolis neighborhood to be bused across town to school in a black neighborhood.
 Before that, she said, her perceptions of African American people had been shaped by protests and uprisings that she had seen in the media during the civil rights era. She said those images led her to imagine that black children might hit her, a notion that was quickly dispelled.
 “We were friends,” she said. “We played on the playground, we went to each other’s houses. I realized that we weren’t any different, and they accepted us.”
 The demonstrations ripping through her city have been an awakening for her, she said, and a realization that Minneapolis has stalled in its progress.
 “Throughout my whole life I’ve considered myself not a racist and considered myself somebody who appreciates the diversity,” she said. “But I’m realizing that that is hardly enough. It’s time to get uncomfortable, it’s time to listen.”
 White liberal residents of Minneapolis point to policy changes that have been praised for their progressivism. A measure in 2018 eliminated single-family zoning, long believed to have perpetuated segregation. Lawmakers voted to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2017, the first major Midwestern city to do so, and mandated sick leave for workers.
 Yet a shift in influence and representation has been slow coming. In 2018, Minnesotans elected Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a Somali American and Muslim, the first woman of color from the state to serve in Congress. And disparities in employment, poverty and education between people of color and white residents are among the worst in the nation.

Goldsmith, Roslyn "Roz" SARATOGA SPRINGS Roslyn "Roz" Goldsmith, 96 of Lawrence Street, died peacefully on Saturday, May 30, 2020, surrounded by her loved ones at Embury Apartments. Born on July 3, 1923, in the Bronx, N.Y., with her beloved twin brother, Sheldon, to Lena and Louis Getzoff. Roz graduated from Hunter College in Manhattan in 1947, and taught for 12 years at P.S. 84 in the Bronx. Throughout her life, Roz was passionate about her love for all things New York. She had a special affinity for tennis, especially the U.S. Open and her N.Y. sports teams, the Yankees, the Giants, and the Knicks. Roz "reluctantly" agreed to meet an upstate N.Y. restaurateur on a blind date on April Fools Day in 1959. After being wined and dined by this upstate gentleman in Times Square, six months later she was married and moved to Saratoga Springs, to be with her husband, Nate. While Nate was the original "Mother" Goldsmith, Roz was behind the scenes helping everything run smoothly. She made daily trips between the two restaurants, (Mother Goldsmith's and The Country Gentleman) transporting Nate, whose eyesight never allowed him to drive, carrying trays of fresh baked pastries or bags of ice. Each evening, Roz would join Nate at the restaurant where they would meet and greet their beloved customers and enjoy dinner together. Roz had a magnetic personality, warm smile and an impeccable sense of style. She loved talking to customers and was often found pouring extra hot coffee at the end of diners' meals. Roz insisted that the only coffee served had to be piping hot, something she enjoyed to her last days. Roz was the consummate host whether at the restaurants, or in her home, where she always welcomed her frequent guests with platters of food especially, pretzels, candies and her famous tuna salad that she would push morning, noon or night. After the sale of the restaurants, Roz returned to teaching, working as a beloved substitute teacher for 10 years in the Saratoga school district. She was devoted to her students, and also her family, so was thrilled with the arrival of her grandchildren, Ben, Lia, Adam, Josh and Hope. Grandma Roz always had kind words of encouragement and showed an intimate awareness of what was going on in each of their lives. Roz was very committed to the Jewish community and was a member of Congregation Shaare Tefille for almost 50 years. Roz, along with Nate, loved attending weekly services and then going out for coffee with a small group that called themselves the C.R.A.F.T. Club. The family extends its heartfelt thanks to Kimberly Moore, who for three and a half years has been Roz's loving caregiver and whose devotion to Roz is something the family will never forget. The family also thanks the nurses and staff of Community Hospice of Saratoga for their compassionate care. Roz was predeceased by her husband of 52 years, Nate Goldsmith; and her twin brother, Sheldon Getzoff. Survivors include her loving children, daughter Paula (Jonathan) Fishbein of Delmar, and son Lawrence (Rhea) Goldsmith of Little Silver, N.J.; five loving grandchildren, Benjamin and Lia Fishbein, and Adam, Josh, and Hope Goldsmith, along with several nieces, nephews and cousins. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the funeral service will be private. The family looks forward to celebrating Roz's life with her friends and extended family at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to Congregation Shaara Tfille, 84 Weibel Ave, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 or to Community Hospice of Saratoga, 179 Lawrence St, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 http://www.communityhospice.org/donate.

The new United States champion Apollo Crews issued a challenge for his title and chose Kevin Owens. The two WWE superstars made good use of ring room during their moves as well just before Owens kicked Crews in the gut to leave him on the ground. The U.S. champ overcame the pain as the two wrestlers traded major blows before the match was unsatisfyingly interrupted by Andrade and Angel Garza. This was then converted into a tag-team match (much to my delight). The two superstars played a dirty game despite their ring talent. However, that was not enough as Apollo Crews pinned Garza after a powerbomb.

Den “change” feiern jetzt die Republikaner. Mit der Rückeroberung beider Häuser des Kongresses sind Präsident Obama für die letzten zwei Jahre seiner Amtszeit die Hände weitestgehend gebunden. Kein Gesetz wird er gegen den Willen der Konservativen durchbringen. Was den Präsidenten im Grunde nicht zu einer noch “lahmeren Ende” (lame duck) macht, die er nicht schon ist. Bereits in den vergangenen vier Jahren haben die Republikaner Obama jeden nur erdenklichen Prügel vor die Beine geworfen. Alle großen Reformvorhaben des demokratischen Präsidenten scheiterten am Widerstand der Republikaner.
