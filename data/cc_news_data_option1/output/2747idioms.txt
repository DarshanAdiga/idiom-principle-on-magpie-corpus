 Dependability was one of the best things about the Kerosene lantern. You applied a match, adjusted the globe and forgot about it.
 Of course, there was always the off-chance that your cow would kick over the lantern and you'd end up burning down Chicago. But generally speaking, kerosene lanterns were cheap and safe - if not especially bright.
 This, however, was not the case with the new-fangled gas lamps. They were sneaky and a considerable number of Burlingtonians went to bed at night after forgetting to turn off the gas that flowed into their bedrooms and woke somewhere on the other side of the hereafter.
 In spite of this risk, at the beginning of the 20th Century Burlington was busily replacing kerosene lamps with gas fixtures that were connected to the town's coal gasification plant on the river front. This new source of light was wildly popular and the gas company was soon hooking everyone up.
 Unfortunately, those gas lamps would never have passed even rudimentary safety standards. An open gas cock would allow an uninterrupted flow through the light fixture. If this gas was not blocked or safely burned off then it would accumulate to a dangerous level in a closed room.
 The newspapers carried many accounts of death and close calls by asphyxiation. Gassing even became a popular way of committing suicide because it was much less painful than swallowing a cup of carbolic acid.
 Coal gas, for all its convenience, could be a danger and this was never made clearer than at 2 p.m. on May 10, 1910, at the manufacturing facility of the Burlington Gas light Company. This brick building was tucked in behind the Rock Island Freight House and the Waterworks at the foot of Arch Street.
 The company's manufacturing boilers and equipment were housed in the one story structure with a galvanized roof. Anyway, it was until gas company employee, Joe Lieb walked into the boiler room that afternoon and detected the over- whelming smell of escaping gas.
 The highly trained Lieb reacted in a thoroughly understandable manner by turning on his heels and running like heck for the nearest exit. He might have made it if he had not collided with his helper, Tom McShane, who was also running for the door.
 Lieb started to explain that they should leave the building but suddenly a tremendous explosion ripped the gas plant apart. Lieb and McShane were propelled through the closed door, sent airborne over the railroad tracks and into a nearby cinder pile as the building began to deconstruct in a most spectacular manner.
 The heavy galvanized roof took to the air, separated into pieces and began to shower down on the North Hill residential neighborhood. Bricks on the west end of the building left their moorings and with unerring accuracy took out most of the windows on the north end of the downtown.
 A grand cloud of coal dust, powdered bricks and smoke rose from the explosion in a rolling mass that erroneously convinced most of the town that the huge gas storage tanks located next to the manufacturing plant had detonated.
 Jack Nolan had been perched atop a 20-foot ladder painting the now vanished building and he simply disappeared. Rescuers feared the worst but, miraculously, he was found a few minutes later, covered with paint and half buried in a large brick pile 60 feet from the building.
 He was picked up and brushed off and, to everyone's amazement, he proved to he unharmed although he did insist on taking off the remainder of the afternoon.
 Lieb and McShane also escaped death but both were badly battered and blackened by the explosion. They were rushed to a doctor's office for treatment of burns and then sent home to recover.
 Workers at the nearby Rock Island Freight House were the first on the scene after they cleared a large loading dock from the gas plant that was blocking the entrance to the freight house.
 They were soon joined by the local fie departments and most of the town. Gas company manager, E.D. Clark, recruited a force of laborers to begin clearing the wreckage and within two days the gas company was back in operation, but it was rumored that the sale of kerosene lamps did enjoy a brief resurgence.

"The US defense community has actually had a hard time coming up with ways to counter weapons like anti-ship ballistic missiles and intermediate range ballistic missiles, and the Chinese have made very good ones," Timothy Heath, a senior international and defense researcher at the Rand Corporation think tank, told Insider.
 Missiles that put US officials on edge are the DF-21, the DF-26 (dubbed the "Guam Killer" for its reported ability to strike targets as far as Guam), and the DF-41, which can carry 10 independent warheads and is purportedly able to reach the continental US in 30 minutes.
 There are also the DF-17 and DF-100, the first hypersonic missiles officially in service with any military.
 The PLARF is reported to have the largest and most diverse land-based missile arsenal in the world -- about 95% of which would violate the INF if were China a signatory.

Zahui B. said her family always encouraged open dialogue, but it was not until a May 2016 trade to the Liberty that she became comfortable with expressing vulnerability.
 Zahui B., who said she had wrestled as a child with the concept of “being Black in Europe and being viewed as a white person when I’m in the Ivory Coast,” said Charles challenged her to think deeply about what it means to be a Black woman in the modern world.
 “You see now people coming from a point of separation to: How do we come together for one thing to affect change?” said Wright, who is now an assistant coach with the Las Vegas Aces. “During that season, we were already there. We were a microcosm of what we happen to see now.”
 Eventually, Zahui B. felt comfortable enough to drive conversations about what actions the team should take throughout the 2016 season. That summer, the Liberty wore black warm-up shirts with messages supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and staged a media blackout, and at least one player sat during the national anthem. Cash began asking Zahui B. about race in Sweden, which led to discussions about the similar issues in the two countries.
 “She started to unlay herself and became outspoken, someone who wanted to impact and leave a lasting impression on you,” said Charles, who is now with the Washington Mystics.
 For Zahui B., those conversations allowed her to elucidate emotions that had previously felt muted and muddled — feelings that stemmed from being followed around stores and banks in Stockholm, her instinct to drive with two hands on the steering wheel and with her driver’s license out next to her in case she was pulled over.
 “Sometimes I have a wall up because I know how the world is,” Zahui B. said. “I speak up, and I’m going to get something back. But learning how to really show that I’m actually human — like, I cry myself to sleep, I have nightmares, we all go through depression and we are all scared and upset — that’s kind of like the growth I’ve had, especially since coming to the Liberty.”
 Last month, Zahui B. discussed the idea of organizing a Black Lives Matter protest in Stockholm with her agent and local activists before joining one already planned for June 3. Zahui B. publicized the march on Instagram, where she estimates a majority of her 15,000-plus followers are Swedish.
 Emboldened by the thousands of Swedes who marched, Zahui B. contacted all the major news stations in Sweden, offering to discuss race on live air. In response, some radio stations proposed interviews about basketball instead.
 “I said no,” Zahui B. said. “I want to talk about what really matters.” She added that she has refrained from giving interviews with certain Swedish stations until they made a concerted effort to address race in their coverage.
 As an alternative, Zahui B. has begun posting unfiltered Instagram videos about race to her largely Swedish audience.
 Zahui B. said it did not bother her if such conversations were uncomfortable for viewers, as she considers them necessary for progress. After the June 3 protest, for example, her neighbor greeted her in the hallway of her building and asked how she was doing.

John Howard, a Union County resident and former county commissioner, said his brother, Paul, was not a member of the church but had contracted the virus as it spread from the church through the rest of the community.
 Howard said he ached at being separated from his brother while he was hospitalized, and was only able to catch a brief glimpse of him as he was being transferred from the local hospital to one in Idaho that has a ward dedicated to virus patients.
 “We were able to see him on the gurney,” Howard recalled. “He saw us and recognized us.”
 On the morning of July 1, his brother died. He was 62 years old. “This didn’t have to happen,” Howard said.
 The recent outbreaks have exacerbated tensions in Oregon’s rural communities, and between the governor, who is seen as representing the state’s big population centers in western Oregon, and county leaders in rural eastern Oregon.
 Umatilla County commissioners have seen their economy battered by the shutdown. The county normally hosts one of the largest rodeos in the United States every fall, which pumps millions of dollars into the local economy and generates significant tax revenue. But the event has been canceled, leaving county commissioners worried about their budget, just as they are spending more to combat the pandemic.
 “I think a lot of the issue is, the metro areas are driving the bus,” said John Shafer, one of the commissioners. “They are dictating what happens out here.”
 He added that the county would follow Brown’s health guidance, but he said communication about state health orders had been poor and worried that the realities of rural life — such as a lack of high-speed internet access that made remote learning difficult — were not being contemplated as the state drew up its guidance for the school year.
 Rural leaders said they felt neglected by the state as they watched their urban counterparts appear at news conferences alongside the governor. Some said they were reassured that a mask order was not in the works, only to hear days later that masks would, in fact, be required throughout the state. The sense of neglect was heightened by Oregon’s decision to hang on to some emergency federal funding, rather than sending it directly to rural communities.
 The state used some of its federal relief funding to buy protective equipment for the counties, reasoning that it could more easily purchase and distribute supplies in bulk. But the decision meant that rural counties did not receive the cash they had hoped for to fund their public health efforts, including the hiring of contact tracers, and to provide relief grants for local businesses.
 Umatilla County expected several million dollars for virus response, Shafer said, but has received only about $725,000 so far. Other states did not follow Oregon’s approach, giving funding directly to counties.
 The governor, in an interview, acknowledged that it has been difficult to manage the virus in a state with so many competing regional priorities.
 “It honestly is tense with everyone right now and has been,” Brown said.

 Rivera, 33, vanished from the boat and search and rescue teams are yet to recover her from the water but they say they are 'confident' they will.
 'There was a picture sent to a family member that showed the boy on the boat by a cove. We found where that cove was,' Robert Inglis of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office Search & Rescue Team told Us Weekly.
 He previously said: 'What I suspect is that the winds kicked up. Those pontoon boats are very light, and when you push them, it can get away from you. She might've tried to swim after the boat. But that's all speculation. Once we do locate her, that'll answer a lot more questions.'

 One area where this is the case is arguably the most important part of a modern naval force: operating aircraft carriers. Unlike the US, which has had almost eight decades of experience with carrier operations, China has no mature doctrine or dedicated carrier task forces.
 Additionally, its carrier aircraft, the J-15, is plagued with problems -- so much so that China may be speeding up development of a stealth fighter replacement.
 China also faces a number of other defense-related challenges, such as its struggles to build efficient jet engines, the negative ramifications of its one-child policy, and issues with corruption within the PLA.

NEW YORK (AP) — One or more victims of Jeffrey Epstein will tell a judge Tuesday that his ex-girlfriend should be denied bail on charges that she recruited teenage girls for him to sexually abuse in the 1990s, prosecutors said Monday.Prosecutors made the revelation in court papers as they argued there is no reason to free British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell on bail.They also revealed new details about Maxwell's July 2 arrest at a $1 million New Hampshire estate she purchased in December, saying FBI agents had to bust into her residence after she failed to cooperate."As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they announced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door," prosecutors wrote. "Through a window, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee to another room in the house, quickly shutting a door behind her."The government said agents were forced to break through the door to arrest Maxwell, who was in an interior room in the home. Prosecutors also revealed that Maxwell had been guarded at the home by a security company staffed with former members of the British military.The descriptions were made as prosecutors sought to boost arguments that the 58-year-old citizen of the U.S., the United Kingdom and France should remain behind bars until trial. They said she had the money, the means and the incentive to flee since she could face many years in prison, if convicted.Prosecutors told a Manhattan federal judge in court papers that at least one woman and possibly more were expected to exercise their right to appear at Tuesday's hearing and ask that Maxwell be detained until trial. And they also revealed that additional individuals have offered the government evidence to support its case since Maxwell's arrest."The Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the victims will be denied justice in this case," prosecutors wrote. They also revealed that two of three women who alleged they were recruited by Maxwell to be sexually abused by Epstein had never spoken to law enforcement authorities until last year.The filing came a day before an arraignment and bail hearing for Maxwell, who has been held for the last week at a federal jail in Brooklyn.On Friday, her lawyers filed arguments that said she's being made a scapegoat after Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan lockup last August. They said she should be freed on $5 million bail with electronic monitoring."Ghislaine Maxwell," they wrote, "is not Jeffrey Epstein."They said their client denies any allegations of misconduct, has had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade and has never been charged with a crime or found liable in civil litigation stemming from the allegations against Epstein.Prosecutors noted that Maxwell's defense lawyers proposed offering as collateral property their client owns in the United Kingdom, but they said that was beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.A defense lawyer did not return a message seeking comment Monday.Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges of women and girls in Florida and New York in the early 2000s when he died by suicide in custody.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

That said, it is important to bear in mind that China does not seek to challenge the US in a military conflict across the entire world or to become the same type of globally-based military as the US.
 Rather, it seeks to assert its authority in its home territory and waters.
 China has a massive advantage in that most of the likely conflict scenarios it faces would take place very close to its territory. This means China may not need the same level of competence as the US, as it will be able to bring more troops, ships and aircraft, and weapons to bear in a fight without facing the challenges of operating over distance.
 As its modernization continues, the PLA will get stronger. Once its equipment issues are fully resolved, it may not take long to develop mature doctrines.

The demographics of many of those workers makes them uniquely mobile during a crisis like this as well. The boom in urban apartment construction during the past decade has been predominantly in luxury studio, one-bedroom and two- bedroom apartments that cater to young, childless, well-paid knowledge workers. The appeal of those developments has been about creating an environment where play is as important as work. Yet because of the pandemic and work-from-home policies, there's no need to live close to the office for the time being. And with bars and restaurants shut or operating with very limited capacity, the play option isn't as attractive either. So when apartment leases expire, as some do every month, it makes sense for some of these renters to put their belongings in storage and move back in with parents or friends and family with extra space to both have more social connections during a time when distancing is the norm and to save money. Because it's unclear when knowledge workers will go back to the office, or if new rounds of layoffs are coming, it make sense to keep your options open rather than get locked into a new one-year lease in an expensive downtown apartment.

Presumably, this public-health crisis will end, even if it looks as if that won't happen until next year. Once it does, there could be a drastic reversal in some of the housing-market trends that began this spring. Perhaps a lot of houses hit the market once foreclosure moratoriums end and as would-be sellers decide to list homes that they held onto in during the lockdowns. That might undo the home-price increases of 2020. And if employers ever call their knowledge workers back to the office, there could be a rush of people flocking to high-cost cities and scrambling to find an apartment, bidding rents back up. But in the meantime, the gap between home prices and apartment rents should continue to widen as the supply of houses for sale remains historically low and renters decide not to renew their leases.
