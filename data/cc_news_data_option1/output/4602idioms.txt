BNT162b2 is based on a novel approach to drug development called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology, which essentially instructs the body to make proteins to fight disease. In the case of COVID-19, BNT162b2 carries the blueprints for building a protein spike that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) uses to enter host cells, prompting an immune system response. Thus far, no mRNA-based therapies, including for other indications such as cancer, have been granted regulatory approval. Should Pfizer and BioNTech’s effort be successful, it would be remarkable not only for proving that the technology works, but also in light of the timeline: BNT162b2 will have been developed and approved for emergency use in less than a year, while historically vaccines have taken 10 years or longer to come to market.

The Patriots’ record says they are not good, and anyone watching Monday night’s game would surely agree. Quarterback Cam Newton played better than in recent weeks but still seems confused and out of sorts at inopportune times. The defense has lost the ability to tackle, and injuries have slowed or sidelined star players like All Pro cornerback Stephon Gilmore. Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and even Stephen Gostowski have gone on to Super Bowl contending teams in Tampa Bay and Tennessee.
 Let’s face it: The Patriots are bad. And things likely won’t get better any time soon. When it was announced Gillette Stadium wouldn’t allow fans through the end of the season it came across more as a mercy than an imposition.
 Meanwhile, the Red Sox reintroduced Alex Cora as their “new” manager, in classic news dump fashion, just as Joe Biden was being declared the winner in the 2020 presidential election. Cora, of course, was suspended for a year by Major League Baseball for his role in the Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal. All it took for forgiveness, it seems, was a 24-36 record and a last- place finish in 2020, one game behind the woebegone Baltimore Orioles.

The Goliad Tigerettes came into the match ranked No. 5 in the state and Ingram was the No. 1 team parked in a spot they have held for over a month.
 Ingram was the home team on a neutral court located nearly two hours away and the entire community appeared to be packed inside of Devine’s beautiful gymnasium.
 If walls could talk, you wouldn’t be able to hear them speak because both teams were loud enough to be heard from miles away.
 With ears ringing after a hotly contested five set match, Goliad (26-3 overall, 14-0 district) walked away with a 3-2 victory over the Ingram Warriors who suffered their only defeat of the entire volleyball season.
 What began as loud cheering turned into a river of tears for the players and fans alike.
 For any fan in attendance, the memories will not be long forgotten.
 Never mind what the scoreboard says, the Ingram Warriors lived up to the true reputation of being a warrior.
 They fought like warriors and they fought until the bitter end.
 When Goliad won the final point of the night, there was disbelief in the eyes of the players who fought like true champions throughout the night.
 In fact, they fought like champions all season long.
 There were no runaways Tuesday night.
 Each team played with grit and determination.
 Each match went down to the wire.
 Just when you thought a team had the game under control, the opposing team would strike back.
 But isn’t this the story of how games ‘should’ be played at this level.
 Both teams played like the elite programs that they truly became this season.
 Mistakes were few and each point was well earned.
 On multiple occasions, it took several minutes to win a single point.
 Players would dig, block, assist and go for a kill before being rejected by another dig, block or unexpected assist.
 Ingram won the first set 25-21 and the Warriors looked like they always do.
 They were in control and only trailed 3-4 in the first set before Anna Crittenden delivered three of her 14 kills on the night to go on an 8-0 run.
 Makenna Gelsone miraculously blocked a shot from a Tigerette that bounced across the net leading to an eruption of cheers for the Warrior faithful.
 Never again would they trail in this set although Goliad rallied to cut the lead to just a few points.
 Set two began with a 4-2 run for the Warriors and then the match went back and forth like clockwork.

 # 'Oh, it's been so long': Mother collapses with joy after wrongfully convicted son freed
 Mariah Timms
 Nashville Tennessean
 View Comments
 The first thing he did was hug his mom.
 Joseph Webster, 41, was released from custody in Nashville on Tuesday after nearly 15 years in Tennessee prisons on a life sentence for a crime the courts now believe he didn't commit.
 He walked out of the Downtown Detention Center to a small crowd of family and old friends who had gathered over the course of about three hours.
 "It's time to pick the pieces up, start my life again," he said.
 Webster was convicted in 2006 on a charge of first-degree murder in the 1998 killing of Leroy Owens. Webster was indicted on the murder charge while in custody for a lesser conviction and has spent nearly two decades in jail on the combined sentences.
 But a years-long investigation by the District Attorney's Conviction Review Unit revealed new evidence that led the state to fully lose confidence in the case against Webster.
 A Nashville judge ordered his conviction be vacated, paving the way for his release and the ultimate dismissal of the murder charge against him.
 Marie Burns, Webster's mother, waited outside for hours on Tuesday evening, pacing and chatting with family by turn. She said she was trying not to cry because if she cried too much she might have a panic attack.
 When Webster came out of the doors after nearly 20 years behind bars, she collapsed and had to be carried across the street to sit in her car while she recovered.
 "Lord have mercy," she shouted, hugging him, her youngest son. "I love you. I'm so glad to see you. Oh, it's been so long, baby. Oh, it's been so long."
 Webster's case was picked up by the CRU after dogged requests by defense attorney Daniel Horwitz.
 "For the District Attorney, for General (Glenn) Funk to create a CRU is a bold and courageous step to take in ensuring that our office engages in self- reflection and self-accountability, which is and should be central to how we view our role in the justice system. When we determined we no longer had confidence in the conviction, we had a moral and ethical obligation to act," current CRU Director Sunny Eaton said in an interview Tuesday.
 "It's been a long time," Webster said. "I just want to enjoy my family. I missed a lot of their life."
 "The truth will set you free."
 Owens, 37, was found beaten to death in the Tony Sudekum Homes public housing area in November 1998. Metro Nashville Police at the time reported two suspects were sought in the killing.
 To Owens' family, Webster offered his condolences.
 "I feel their pain, but I ain't the one that did it. I hope they find out the person who actually did it," he said. After a pause, he added, "I do feel sympathy for them. I wish them the best on their situation, too."
 Family members praised Horwitz and his work, saying he had been the first to truly care about Webster's story.
 "I'm relieved," Horwitz said Tuesday evening outside the detention center. At one point he joked with Burns about stealing the first hug with Webster on his release.
 He was, later, pulled grinning into an embrace by his client, as family members cheered.
 Webster was also greeted by his sons, both of whom were small children when he was arrested, a nephew, old friends and a relative's new puppy. The mood waiting outside the jail was almost festive.
 "Trouble is easy to get into and hard to get out of," Burns said after news came down that Webster would be released but before he walked out the door. "I've been through the storm. It's a long fight, but I'm going to fight it. The Lord answers your prayers, especially when you're right.
 "I'm not going to say anything when I see him. I'm just going to hug him and kiss him and cry."

Ivey, a freshman guard who starred at Mishawaka Marian before finishing his high school career at LaLumiere, was pressed into more action when Hunter hobbled off the floor after banging knees with a teammate.
 Running the point, Ivey raised his level of play. He was quick and under control in the open court. He finished around the rim. He drained pull-up jumpers. He grabbed one rebound and nearly traveled coast-to-coast, finishing with an impressive dunk, as coaches were saying, “stop the ball, stop the ball.”
 Nobody stopped the ball.
 “Today was his best day. Not just his best scrimmage but his best day of all the practices,” Painter said.
 The fact that Ivey has already mastered the art of sprinting and shooting is a sign he’ll see plenty of action this season. He scored 22 points on 8 of 12 shooting Monday.
 “All kids come in and can knock down shots standing still but their ability to knock down a high volume of shots while they’re on the move, normally that takes a while,” Painter said. “He walked in the door being able to move and shoot. That’s a good quality.”
 There’s still plenty to learn. Ivey has the versatility to play multiple positions on the perimeter but knowing what to do — and when to do it — will take time. Add the defensive piece — a priority in Painter’s program — and Ivey has a long way to go.
 But the work ethic, the willingness to watch film, and the desire to improve are all there and will pay off down the road. Ivey still has a lot to sort out, but Monday may have been the day it started to come together.
 “When guys are that way and they don’t have things figured out yet, sometimes their abilities don’t come out,” Painter said. “Right as that light clicks on for them, they can really take off and you see a talented guy like Jaden Ivey have a great day today.”
 Hunter’s absence took away one of the team’s most important players, and Painter said the junior’s knee injury is a bone bruise but was scheduled to undergo an MRI on Tuesday “just to make sure.”

After the 35-year-old Mowery graduated from South Hagerstown High School, he worked at some restaurants. Then he joined the U.S. Army, becoming a combat engineer and serving a tour in southern Iraq.
 Among the experiences that impacted him was seeing kids in that country running around without any shoes while temperatures soared above 100 degrees.
 "It just made me realize what we have back here," said Mowery, who was in the U.S. Army from 2009 to 2012.
 When Mowery returned home, he started thinking about how he wanted to earn a living. Mowery said he and his wife, Amber, have always had an entrepreneurial spirit, and one business idea they had didn't pan out.
 Then the couple, who live in the Robinwood area, learned about JDog.
 "We've fallen in love with it ever since," Mowery said.
 They met with JDog company officials in Philadelphia and things began to work out. They received job training and got their truck a few weeks ago.
 Mowery said he and Amber "hit the ground running" with the business and have been getting steady phone calls and emails for service.
 Mowery said after he receives a call, he makes an appointment to meet the client at the job site. He assesses what they have and gives them an estimate.

Advertising technology company Hudson MX said it hired Sarah Lawson Johnston as executive VP, managing director of agency partnerships, for the EMEA region, a new post.
 Johnston had been with Mediaocean for more than 20 years before spending the past three years as part of the team launching Covatic. She will remain on the board of Covatic.
 “As the Hudson MX solution is embraced by agencies with operations across the globe, it is absolutely crucial that we have the right people in place to advocate for their needs," said JT Batson, CEO of Hudson MX.
 “I had the pleasure of working with Sarah and becoming her friend when we were both with Mediaocean, and knowing how rare it is for her to make a move I'm honored that she's chosen to join us. I've seen first-hand how incredibly talented she is when it comes to brokering alliances, tailoring unique technology solutions, leading geographically diverse teams, and recognizing opportunities for clients," Batson said. “Sarah does the kind of work that inspires immense trust, and that trust will be essential as we collaborate with our new partners to bring the media ecosystem into the 21st century."
 Johnston will report to Batson.
 While at Mediaocean, Johnston focused on new and existing revenue, oversaw offices in London, France and Germany, and had responsibility for the company's European client relationships and business.
 “I'm thrilled to be joining Hudson MX at such an exciting inflection point," said Johnston. “They secured proof of concept through their work in local markets, they've established a fully comprehensive platform to replace legacy providers as the system of record, and they're now breaking ground with the global agencies. The industry has been crying out for alternatives for years and Hudson MX has delivered a solution that far exceeds the original demand. I have great respect for JT Batson and I look forward to working with him and his team to develop the culture of the company and expand its reach."

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - In a warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the agency is reporting the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening and that small gatherings at home are a big contributor to a rise in cases.This comes as many Americans are weighing their options for Thanksgiving celebrations in just a few weeks.Like other activities we’ve seen impacted by the coronavirus pandemic this year, Thanksgiving will also look different for many Americans.“We plan on staying home, quarantining and just enjoying Thanksgiving together," said Daniel Swezey.The CDC’s guidelines for Thanksgiving celebrations say higher risk activities for spreading COVID-19 include large indoor gatherings and participating or watching a race. Lower risk activities for spreading COVID-19 include having a small dinner with those who live with you or a virtual dinner and shopping online on Black Friday.As the COVID-19 pandemic has been stressful for many Americans, holiday gatherings can be a way to reconnect with friends and family.“Every year we have Thanksgiving at my house with all of my family. Usually there’s about 35, but this year it will probably be a little bit less because of the virus. But I’m still going to do it. I cook every year and we have a great time," said Sheryl Cline.If you plan to cook those tried and true Thanksgiving favorites, the CDC recommends wearing a mask while preparing or serving food and have one person who is wearing a mask serve all of the food. The CDC also suggests using single-use options or having one person serve sharable items like salad dressings and condiments.“I’m excited about it. I always get excited about it. Before now I’ve been excited, but I want everybody to come, but I don’t want them to come if they don’t feel right. It’s just like that," Cline explained.“We’re going to be careful. Take every precaution you can, but also just enjoy what you can with your family," added Cline’s grandson, Jake Koehler.The CDC recommends outdoor over indoor gatherings and to wear a mask both inside and outside except when eating and drinking.If you do plan to gather to chow down on turkey and pumpkin pie, the same guidelines the CDC has been recommending for months still apply, like social distancing, no direct contact, including hugs or handshakes, and frequent handwashing.

Volatility is not out of the picture, particularly if more economies must go into lockdown near term as we await the global distribution of a vaccine. But the news from Pfizer and BioNTech raises hope that a solution may be on the horizon and that other vaccines targeting the same SARS-CoV-2 protein – including a second mRNA therapy from Moderna – may be successful. The approval of multiple vaccines is viewed as critical to quickly and effectively protecting the world’s population, with important implications for the global economy. What’s more, mRNA platforms, by their nature, could be readily modified to address new versions of the virus in the future, should that become necessary.

"Hello, Dr. Hummel's office. Yes, of course. I understand."
 Dr. Barbara Hummel hung up the office phone with a sigh. Another patient canceling their appointment.
 Hummel's been running her Milwaukee private practice since 1995.It was her dream job, since she decided to go back to school for medicine when she was 36 years old.
 At the height of her business, she would see about 16 patients a day. But since the coronavirus pandemic, she's been lucky to see nine patients come through the door. Some days, as few as two patients have shown up.
 She is now the sole employee of her office, working as a doctor, receptionist and office manager.
 "This last year has been rough," the 77-year-old family doctor said. "My practice is technically bankrupt so I'm paying all my expenses out of my personal funds … using retirement savings."
 Hummel is not alone. Smaller physician practices like hers are struggling to stay open during the public health crisis as the coronavirus continues to strain the American health care system. A survey issued by the American Medical Association late last month found the average revenue in medical practices has dropped by 32%.
 Revenue reductions were 50% or greater for nearly 1 out of 5 physicians, according to the nationally representative survey of 3,500 physicians, administered from mid-July through August.
 "Physician practices continue to be under significant financial stress due to reductions in patient volume and revenue, in addition to higher expenses for supplies that are scarce for some physicians," said AMA President Dr. Susan R. Bailey.
 One-third of surveyed physicians said in-person visits decreased by 50% or more during the pandemic.
 Hummel says her revenue is down nearly 60% as the majority of her patients are older and afraid to leave their homes. They know the coronavirus disproportionately impacts people over the age of 70.
 Wisconsin reported more than 38,000 new cases in the week ending Sunday - setting another record for the state. Nearly 13,000 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized with more than 1,500 of them in the intensive care units.
 Hummel knows at her age she too is at higher risk for severe disease but that doesn't stop her from going to the office every day and visiting patients. Recently, she made a house call to one of her 100-year-olds to give her a flu shot in the backyard.
 "I'm concerned, I take all the precautions I can. I know that if I get COVID I'm probably at risk of being one of the fatalities but if I dwell on that I wouldn't leave my house and I can't do that," she said. "I have an obligation to be here and to help provide care for my patients and I understand that obligation."
 Many offices have turned to telemedicine. But despite an increase in virtual visits since February, the AMA survey found nearly 7 out of 10 physicians said they were still providing fewer overall visits.
 Hummel has tried to help her patients adapt to telemedicine. Most of them don't have cell phones, let alone a computer.
 "Telemedicine doesn't pay for the office overhead, not at all," she said. "And, again, most of my patients don't even have access to it so that doesn't work."
 While smaller practices struggle to break even, they're faced with additional costs. Nearly half of medical practice owners surveyed by the AMA said spending on personal protective equipment has increase 50% or moresince February.
 Thirty-six percent of physicians said acquiring more PPE was very or extremely difficult for smaller practices that lack purchasing power to compete with larger health systems.
 Before the pandemic, Hummel spent about $12 on a pack of 50 surgical masks. In the spring, that same pack of masks cost $50. When demand from bigger hospital systems overwhelmed her distributors, she resorted to buying masks from Amazon, which cost $15 to $30 per pack.
 Since Hummel began offering COVID-19 testing in the spring, she's had to buy more gowns, gloves, face shields and N95 masks. Testing doesn't bring any revenue to the office, in fact, it depletes PPE and other resources but she believes it's a service the community needs.
 "I had to scrounge," Hummel said. "I had a patient actually bring me my first N95 mask because I couldn't find it and he was a woodworker and he had four or five of them in his shop."
 Concerned for her older patients, Hummel also invested in UV-C light equipment to disinfect exam rooms during her lunch break and at the end of the day.
 She also spends more on hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. She keeps a bottle of hand sanitizer in every corner of the office and schedules 15 minutes between patients to disinfect everything in the exam room.
 The AMA argues their survey shows more economic relief is needed from Congress "as some medical practices contemplate the brink of viability, particularly smaller practices that are facing a difficult road to recovery."
 Family practices had been struggling since before the pandemic. According to AMA's Physician Practice Benchmark Surveys in 2018, 54% of physicians were working in private practices compared to 60.1% in 2012.
 But Hummel isn't giving up. She's worked in big hospitals and has no interest in returning to that type of medicine. If things don't pick up in the next year, she's considering leasing her space to another doctor and splitting expenses, or joining an independent physicians group.
 "A lot of these patients have been with me for 15 to 20 years and that's hard for them. Change is hard for some of my older patients," she said. "So, I'll stick around for as long as I can."
