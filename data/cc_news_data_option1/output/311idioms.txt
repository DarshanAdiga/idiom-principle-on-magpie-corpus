These shortfalls, however, don’t mean that nothing is happening in manufacturing. Despite being stagnant for decades, the sector, which accounts for 8.7 per cent of GDP, as has been noted by Messrs Clarke and Shaw, is showing new signs of life, or “a renaissance”, as the ministers put it. On the back of the economic reforms of the last seven years, manufacturing, on average, grew at more than two per cent a year, since 2015.

"Barbès," "Frida Kahlo," "The chic rabbis," "Voyage-Voyage," "Le Grand Voyage," tributes to Ukraine and Russia, China and Spain… So many collections that speak volumes about the importance of ethnic and cultural references from all over the world in the fashion created by Jean-Paul Gaultier. The designer has made it an element of language, which is stylistically translated by the remastering of traditional costumes, religious or cultural symbols, between coats donning Union Jack flags, Japanese kimonos, bullfighter boleros revisited, mini skirts made of African boubous, fitted suits playing with Maori tattoos in trompe-l'oeil, and, on the accessories side, umbrellas, massaï necklaces, Andalusian fans, and caps with rounded tops in faux mink reminiscent of the Orthodox Jews. Beyond clothing, with Jean-Paul Gaultier, beauty is also expressed in many ways. This is demonstrated by the mixed castings that punctuate his collections and contribute to the broadening of the criteria of beauty, and the choice of the Franco-Algerian Farida Khelfa as muse since 1979.

Chicago is widely known as the "windy city" but the California city of Palm Springs has been benefiting from its Santa Ana winds since 1982, when the first wind farm was built in the San Gorgonio Pass.
 Coming from Los Angeles, travelers will find thousands of turbines -- about 4,000 -- on both sides of Interstate 10. Driving by, the energy producing "windmills" look big, but travelers can't really get a handle on how big until standing next to one. Some of the blades are more than half the size of a football field, standing about 150 feet tall. At the top, the turbines have a generator that weighs in at 30,000 to 45,000 pounds.
 The wind farm provides enough energy to power Palm Springs and the entire Coachella Valley. It is quite a sight, and to get an understanding of how it all works, take a wind farm tour. Best of the Best Tours offers tours with knowledgeable guides -- a lot more fun than science class. For information and to purchase tickets visit thebestofthebesttours.com.
 Palm Springs is also known for its movie history. Many famous people lived in this valley, including Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Tony Curtis, Sandra Dee, Gene Autry, Cary Grant, Elvis and so many more. It was where they escaped to enjoy privacy and relaxation. Today's stars who can be seen in the area include Leonardo DiCaprio, Suzanne Somers, Barbra Streisand and James Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt and President Obama and family.
 History walking tours are offered through the Palm Springs Historical Society for those interested in the homes of the stars and architecture. Visit pshistoricalsociety.org. Best of the Best Tours also offers a Rich and Famous Tour that includes homes to the stars.
 This valley of 48,000-plus residents offers a large variety of entertainment, from theaters, concerts and plays to horseback riding and snowshoeing. Yes, this warm, sunny, palm-tree-lined city offers winter sports. Take a short tram ride up the mountain -- 8,516 feet -- to Mount San Jacinto State Park, where residents and visitors take part in winter sports and camping, hiking and guided nature walks in the summer. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway takes riders high above the valley to the snow-capped mountains. At the top of the mountain, visitors will find Peaks Restaurant. It offers beautiful views of the Coachella Valley and good food. Also at the top is Pines Cafe, a cafeteria-style restaurant, and the Lookout Lounge, offering alcoholic beverages and appetizers.
 The tram itself is an experience. It rotates as travelers ascend and descend the mountain to take in all the views of the valley and the mountains. The first tram was completed in 1963, but a project was completed in 2000 that added new cars and renovated the facilities. It is known as the world's largest rotating tramcar system ever constructed. Visit pstramway.com for details on the tram rides, dining and activities.

“The move to scrap over £308 million of relief, which is strongly opposed by the SNP, could impact more than 100,000 businesses across Scotland, and cost smaller businesses in West Lothian £7,000 in business rates.
 “This would be a real blow to our local communities and could risk the delivery of vital local services, the work of charities and third-sector organisations.
 “I’ve been personally contacted by businesses in West Lothian raising their concerns over the impact of these proposed changes and opposition MSPs must now heed their warnings and reverse this disastrous proposal at Stage 3 in order to support our economy and make West Lothian the best place for business to invest.”

Guyana, once the region’s basket case, has been growing steadily, at around four per cent, for the better part of a decade. Recent big oil and gas finds off its coast are turning the country into a significant oil producer, with a projected output of 120,000 barrels a day this year. Oil production is expected to reach 750,000 bpd in five years, several multiples of Trinidad and Tobago’s current production.
