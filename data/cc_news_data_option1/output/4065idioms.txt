Smoot sees a message in his saga: “You should always think about the consequences of your actions,” he said. “Small things can have big consequences. I don’t know of a better example than this one thing that affected my life. Luckily, it’s a positive.”
 The measurement was not the only time he was in the right place at the right time to make an impact, although not in two hours but during a 43-year career.
 While in law school in 1964 he began working in a new field called computer programing. “I became head over heels on computer work operating big main- frame computers that used computer cards and tape,” he recalled.
 He continued with computer programming after graduating law school in 1966.

Once they have a ballot in hand, some older adults need help from family or staff at their facilities to complete it correctly and send it back to election officials. The federal directive to relax visiting rules could ease some of that pressure, but the situation varies by facility. For people whose relatives cannot help them, it may fall to staff members to set up calls and video chats between residents and their families, or provide the assistance to residents themselves.

Evan Rodrigues is back to where he once belonged.
 The Pittsburgh Penguins signed the 27-year-old forward to a one-year deal worth $700,000 on Friday, less than two months after Pittsburgh shipped him to Toronto as part of a trade that brought Kasperi Kapanen to Pittsburgh.
 The Penguins originally acquired Rodrigues from Buffalo in February in a deal that sent Dominik Kahun to the Sabres for Rodrigues and Conor Sheary. Rodrigues had one goal in seven games during his first stint with Pittsburgh.
 The Penguins also signed forward Mark Jankowski to a one-year contract worth $700,000 and forward Josh Currie to a two-way contract also worth $700,000.

It's become nearly automatic for anyone writing a memoir about Trump to be threatened with legal action. So introducing this one as "a book the President of the United States does not want you to read" is only par for the course.

She graduated from Ballard High School in Seattle in 1954 and from the University of Washington in 1958 with a B.A. degree in Business Administration. In 1961, she married Dr. Don Miles, a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, and they lived in Albuquerque, Boston and Houston before settling in Phoenix. She had three children Eric (Dawn), Sterling (Jessica) and Sara (Nick Alcock). She cherished her time with her grandchildren Sophia and Magnus Miles, Abigail and Jacob Alcock and Lyndon Miles. She enjoyed volunteer work at the Heard Museum and going on many Heard trips throughout the Southwest U.S., Mexico and Canada. She had many good memories of traveling to Europe, South America, the Middle East and China when the world was a safer place. She was an avid reader, eager to learn about different cultures and customs along with her personal favorites being Scandinavian crime thrillers.

Poet and novelist Julia Alvarez is back with a jewel of a novel, "Afterlife" that explores the life of a woman coping with widowhood and isolation in a small Vermont town.
 Dominican immigrant Antonia Vega has had many identities -- wife, college professor, sister, neighbor. But two of those have disappeared with her retirement and the death of her husband, Sam, and the two that remain are under assault.
 Part of Antonia wants to crawl into her environmentally sustainable home and stay there, but the world keeps knocking, forcing her out of immobilizing grief.
 There's her dairy farmer neighbor, grumpy Roger, the "old Vermonter" who can be dismissive one moment and thoughtful the next. He has hired two undocumented immigrants to milk his cows out of necessity, not generosity, and he has little patience for their travails.
 When he sends one of the workers, Mario, over to clean Antonia's gutters, his arrival incites a series of incidents that will pull her back into the world.

 Meanwhile, her sisters Mona and Tilly are frantic over their older sister, Izzy, who is having a manic episode that involves buying a motel and rescuing some llamas.
 There's nothing new about this plot -- the widowed man or woman brought out of grief by the exigencies of the living. "Olive Kitteridge" by Elizabeth Strout and Stewart O'Nan's "Emily, Alone" are two examples that come to mind.
 Antonia was always more reserved than her husband, a physician who was unfailingly generous with his money and his time. Helping others, even her beloved sisters, doesn't come easily.
 But her introversion makes her a great protagonist. She has a ready store of quotes from stories and poems she taught over the years, and her observations are tinged with humor.
 Whether it's her sister Tilly's malapropisms or the self-conscious mannerisms of the sheriff who seems sweet on her, Antonia views people with both insight and charity -- even when she tells us she just wants to be alone.
 The plot is sufficient, but it's Antonia's voice that makes this story worth reading.

 # Art, history coming together for local historical society
 Messenger Post Media
 MPNnow
 Will fairies and other mythical woodland creatures help a local historical society survive the pandemic? That’s what the Bristol Hills Historical Society is banking on in an art and publishing venture that aims to connect local landowners and an illustrator with a whimsical take on the natural world.
 Board member John Holtz, former South Bristol town historian and owner of Berby Acres Tree Farm, commissioned a painting of a favorite spot on his land from artist Anna Overmoyer, a Bloomfield native who teaches illustration at Rochester Institute of Technology. Her watercolor and ink work features mythical creatures in woodland settings.
 “I grew up in the forest and have always imagined the creatures that lurk just beyond our sight, pulling nature’s strings,” Overmoyer said.
 Holtz was so pleased with the result that he had an idea to invite other local residents to commission their own Overmoyer originals set in spots on their own properties or elsewhere in the region.
 With permission from the artist and art buyers, approximately 15 pieces will be published in a book to raise money for Bristol Hills Historical Society, which has had to suspend its programs and fundraising events because of COVID-19. The new art patrons will explain the site they chose, and tell stories about their land and the magical hold it has on them.
 “We are living in an area with a reputation for magic and old stories [rooted in Seneca lore],” Holtz said. “The definition of magic depends on each individual’s use of that term. These spots of magic could be a dramatic waterfall, a simple stack of firewood next to a tree, a stone wall, a view where mist rises up off a pond or a field where you spot deer in the moonlight. You know your land and you know what spot grabs your heart when you look at it. Those are the spots we want to share with the world in this book.”
 Bristol Hills Historical Society members will get first dibs on filling the 15 slots. Then, the opportunity will be opened to all other area residents. Once enough people have expressed interest, the Society will meet with Overmoyer to discuss costs. Overmoyer will need photographs of the sites she is to depict in the paintings.
 Call 585-229-4833, email berbyacres@msn.com, or visit bristolhillshistsoc.org or anna-overmoyer.square.site for information.

Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, who is also a Democrat, said state law requires that if a major party nominee dies within 79 days of Election Day, a special election must be held for that office on the second Tuesday in February, which would be Feb. 9. Legal Marijuana Now has major party status in Minnesota under a law that lets a small party qualify if one of its candidates for statewide office got at least 5% of the vote in a recent election.
 The Legislature changed state election law to avoid a repeat of the hectic 2002 race, when Sen. Paul Wellstone was killed in a plane crash 11 days before the election. Democrats chose former Vice President Walter Mondale to replace Wellstone on the ballot, but he lost the seat to Republican Norm Coleman.
 Craig is facing a challenge from Republican Tyler Kistner, a Marine Corps veteran making his first run for office. Kistner argued that the election should be held in February, as state law allows. His attorneys said in court documents that a February election would protect the interest of the candidates, election officials and voters. They also said that the state law is consistent with federal law because, unlike a presidential election, congressional races are determined in the local district, not by national votes.
 While Craig argued that a special election would lead to chaos and cause voter confusion and disenfranchisement, Kistner’s attorneys said a special election would instead provide all major parties and voters an equal opportunity to participate. The state law also gives voters who have already cast their vote for Weeks another opportunity to vote for someone else.

“It definitely directly pushes back on those that want to cast doubt in the election process. And so while it’s boring and most people will probably stop watching — it still educates the public on the process, what it looks like, how it happens,” McReynolds said. “They can see that their neighbors are in that room you know, and part of the population and part of the public is actually part of this process. It’s not done behind closed doors.”
 Its purpose is to show the public exactly what happens when their ballots arrive. And because the coronavirus pandemic is forcing many to vote by mail or at drop boxes, the video stream is one way of increasing trust in the system, said Alton Dillard, spokesperson for the Denver Elections Division.
 “Given the pandemic and the limitations on in-person tours of our ballot processing rooms, we wanted to provide some transparency into the process,” Dillard said.
 Denver borrowed the idea from the King County Elections division in Seattle, which has done live webcasts of its ballot processing rooms since 2012. Like Colorado, Washington is a mail ballot state. Others taking the video route include Yuma county in Arizona, Los Angeles and San Francisco in California.

Limestone mined by Cornish miners is just one of the sturdy materials used in the home’s construction. Other original elements include the marble fireplace and yellow-pine flooring. The Stuarts replaced the electrical and plumbing, bringing the property up to code.
 They also converted the formal dining room into a kitchen designed for contemporary use. When they tore down the drywall, they discovered the original plaster beneath.
 “A lot of the original features of the house were covered up. You don’t have the problems you might have with an old wood house,” says Brian, adding that the 125-year-old wood windows are in impeccable condition and only needed interior storm windows.
 Diane sourced period lighting fixtures that were later electrified.
 The historic home was constructed by Moses Strong, a settler from Rutland, VT, who wanted to create a home along the lines of those he’d seen in his home state. Strong was also a land agent for the Wisconsin Territory, before Wisconsin was admitted into the union in 1848.
 “He built the house as a testament to his legacy,” says Brian. “He became pretty much one of the founding fathers in Wisconsin. He wanted a house that looked like it was in Vermont: simple, clean lines.”
 It’s almost early American in style, he notes.
 In 2013, the Stuarts began to rent out rooms in the home to overnight guests via Airbnb. Their thought is that the next owner may want to follow suit, even choosing to live on site.

 # Hello HS sports, it's great to see you back
 Bob Chavez
 It’s been an adjustment, as most of life has been since March, but we’re back.
 Well, almost.
 But even if the routine of high school sports is not in the full gear that we’ve known for years, at least we’re shifting up instead of down. And how sweet it is to even be in a gear other than park as we navigate through this coronavirus pandemic.
 That said, I miss football like crazy. I miss the excitement and power of volleyball and the timing and coordination of cheer, but it’s football I miss the most right now. There is no thrill in covering games quite like being on the sideline for games where you can hear the clashing of pads, the yapping of mouths and the berating by coaches.
 It’s intense, for sure.
 Still, we have plenty to take in for this truncated season and even though we’re barely a week in, here’s what I’ve seen, heard and experienced so far that’s made me smile the most.
 ► You know that feeling you get when you’re driving to a game and you’re getting close? Then you see the parking lot, or the school busses, or the stadium lights from a distance and you just want to burst with excitement?
 I hadn’t felt that since early March. So welcome back, that glorious feeling.
 ► Senior Nights are big and traditionally, they’re held on the final home game of the regular season because in many cases, that’s the final game seniors will play on their home field. But this year, most schools are holding Senior Nights on the first home game of the season, just in case we’re not able to finish the season.
 The big hurdle, however, is the rule that allows just two spectators per athlete. But I’ve read on more than one social media account where family of underclassmen have given their two passes to the family of a senior to allow more family members to be there for Senior Night festivities.
 That’s an incredibly unselfish gesture and deserves a standing ovation.
 ► On this side the monitor, do you have any idea how thrilling it is to see coaches e-mailing game results again?
 My inbox wasn’t very active for about four months, but the activity started to pick up when preseason reports were coming in to help for our previews. Then two weeks ago, we started to get golf scores.
 A few days after that, cross-country results were coming in along with tennis, swimming and soccer for the boys and girls. In addition, photographers were e-mailing their pictures in and we’re back to putting together high school roundups again.
 I figured these were missed by readers, and the digital metrics are proving that. So it’s not only great to be doing these roundups again, it’s great to know these roundups are what you’e wanted to see again for a long time.
 ► On photos, there is a certain rhythm during each HS season when we’re planning coverage. Especially when we plan photo shoots. Before the pandemic, we’d just look at the schedule and assign photographers. They show up, take the pictures and head home.
 But it’s different now. In addition to planning for each photographer, we have to check in with each Athletic Director to have names added to a list. Some schools require health screenings so the rhythm we’re developing on this side is definitely a bit different than what we’re used to.
 ► Going to games usually offers a familiar face or two. But this year, everyone looks the same with masks covering the faces. So forgive me now if I give you a blank stare in case I don’t recognize you behind the mask.
 ► Speaking of masks and the two-fan limit, a few ADs I’ve talked with already say they’ve encountered no issues with resistance. That’s so relieving to hear.
 It’s not fun to wear masks, but it’s also not difficult. It’s also not fun to have kids picking two names for each game, but that’s where we are. Let’s keep playing by the rules and not make things difficult or awkward for anyone.
 ► As sports fans, we’re at near saturation with high school sports back. Because we’ve also got the NFL, NASCAR, college football and Major League Baseball going on as the NBA wraps up in the few days, just a week after the NHL finished.
 And even though the NHL is done, it’s looking at a December start for the 2021 season and the NBA may get going again in January. The only complaint we can have as sports fans is not knowing where to turn next, and that’s quite a problem to have.
 ► So maybe there is plenty to like about the direction local sports is heading right now, but there also is still plenty to desire. And if I’m having this much trouble being patient, how about the kids who get to play the sports?
 It really is true that we may not know what we have until it’s taken away. But it’s also true that we should seize the day. Every new day with new games is a blessing, so let’s be thankful for what we have while being mindful of how we got here.
 That’s what will get us back to where we want to be.

But analysts don't expect these products to hold a strong presence at Apple's October 13 event, as the company will likely want to keep the focus on the new iPhones.
 The one exception may be a less expensive new version of Apple's HomePod smart speaker. The leaker Kang, who is said to have a strong track record when reporting on upcoming Apple products, recently said the company may introduce a $99 HomePod during its October 13 event.
 Bloomberg previously reported that a smaller, more affordable HomePod is in the works, also saying that both the HomePod and over-ear headphones could debut as early as this month. Still, the report didn't say whether these devices could debut at the event.

Conte has robustly defended his striker despite criticism. After his brace at Napoli in January, he said: ‘I heard people say Lukaku was a donkey not that long ago.
 “I always said Romelu was a rough diamond that needed work to smooth him out. I wanted Romelu when I was at Chelsea, even back at Juventus. Now I can get to work on polishing the diamond.”
 Lukaku was always given a rough time in English football. Despite his strong goalscoring record in the Premier League – he averaged close to a goal every other game for three clubs – Lukaku was never properly appreciated and not wanted by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Now he is feeling the love and enjoying la dolce vita in Italy.
 “I love being in Italy, it’s the best country I’ve ever been in,” said Lukaku. “Italians welcomed me with open arms.
 “Even the football has helped me improve. Italian football is much more tactical. I study how a defender plays, how he positions himself in a position or how he reacts in certain situations. After training I stay 15 to 20 minutes with the coaching staff so I am prepared for any situation.”

Cunningham tried to return the campaign’s arc back to issues and Tillis, who with GOP allies have been relentless this week in trying to make his personal decisions the focus approaching Election Day. Both Tillis and the Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, started running ads this week emphasizing TV reports about the revelations.
 “Cal Cunningham — what else is he hiding?” the leadership fund’s ad says.
 Like another virtual speech he gave on Wednesday, Cunningham again on Friday pushed back at Tillis, accusing the Republican of using the incident to draw voters away from his record as a senator. Friday’s online event began with Cunningham speaking with representatives of a union and teacher lobbying group and a small business operator about additional COVID-19 relief that he blames Tillis for failing to deliver.
 “I’m hearing from North Carolinians that are telling me in no uncertain terms that they want their Senate candidate talking about the issues like those that we’re talking about right here today. People are tired of hearing about personal issues,” he said.

Responding to concerns that have been raised by many about people’s “civil rights” being infringed upon by the orders, there are many examples of rules and laws that are in place to protect people’s health and safety.
 “We have a lot of things we do that protect the public from ourselves. The seatbelt law is one example. Wearing shoes and shirts in stores is another example ... It is the responsibly of the government to do those. There are also rights for the health of the public,” Page said.
 Damoose said if he was a member of the legislature right now he would be working to get the state “back to normal as soon as it is safely possible.”
 “The natural state of affairs is open and free, and any limitations we place on that condition should be constantly restrained as much as possible. I would also be fighting to ensure that a governor can never again go around the Legislature. Remember, this is a constitutional issue — and it doesn’t just apply to one specific party,” he said.
 Page said if he was sitting in the legislature, he would be focusing on working together with the state health department and the CDC and other health experts on developing the proper safety guidelines based on the best information available.
 “I’m not going to listen to the mechanic down the road to tell me how to take care of my health,” he said.
 He said he would be working with other legislators to reinforce the need for the mandates so they can work together in implement them.
 He said although he would be interested in looking at developing new legislation that would address the need for the state government to respond to a future emergency, he said he’d hope that in the future “we’ll have representatives that will say, ‘Hey, wait a minute, we need protect the public here and we need to do this.’”
 “We need to stop this rhetoric that is going on and treat it as a health issue and not a political issue,” he added.
 However, he said he does believe that emergency power legislation should have checks and balances built into it.

Lake Okeechobee water levels have risen to a critical level, and on Friday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it will very likely begin water releases next week.This comes just weeks before the dry season begins, so there's hope the releases won't have to last long.We've gone almost two full summers without any Lake O water releases toward the Treasure Coast.But county experts said they suspect that streak will end with the lake now at more than 16 feet, which they said hasn't been since Hurricane Irma.Every time Danny Robitaille can get his boat in the water and take people paddleboarding, he knows he's buying his business, Liquid Aloha Paddle Company, a little more time."This year we can’t afford any other things to happen," Robitaille said.COVID-19 was one challenge. Now he's learning Lake Okeechobee water releases are on the way."It’s just one of those things you don’t know how long they’re going to release for," Robitaille said.That makes it hard for Robitaille to predict the impacts. But he said any hit to water quality poses a threat."If it’s not safe to let people out, obviously I’ll have to halt my rentals," Robitaille said."It’s pretty bad right now, we’ve just had so much rain," said John Mahl, the ecosystem and restoration management manager for Martin County.Mahl said the typically brackish estuary is already inundated with fresh water."The news today that we’ll have to add lake discharges is of course not welcome news," Mahl said.But it's news he knew was likely to come."This rainfall has just been overwhelming, and the lake has risen at a rate that’s kind of alarming to the Army Corps of Engineers," Mahl said.But one saving grace he said is the timing of the releases. Later in the season with cooler water temperatures, they're less likely to promote toxic algae blooms."I’d rather it be this time of year, not in June," Robitaille said.Mahl said the releases will 1,800 cubic feet per second a day, equivalent to about a super dome's worth of water per day.

I try to be a better man because of those things.”
 Tyler and his family fled from Liberia to the Ivory Coast in 1999. He was left in the care of his aunts while part of his family immigrated to the United States, where his stepfather was from, in order to work and secure the finances necessary to have Tyler join them.

Their responses mirrored those voiced by many of their respective fellow party members.
 Damoose said the governor’s actions in issuing the orders were wrong because they “usurped the power of the legislature.”
 “Like it or not, America is a nation based on individual rights and responsibilities, and we are bound by the rule of law. We develop those laws and governmental structures in times of calm so that we do not have to grapple with them in times of emergency. While we were all initially behind efforts to ‘flatten the curve,’ there was no excuse for the Executive Branch to completely usurp the power of the Legislature throughout our response to COVID-19,” Damoose said.
 He said Whitmer should not “ignore the representatives who have the best understanding of their individual districts throughout the state.”
 He said with the proper checks and balances in place, the state government “does have a duty to respond to important crises, but such responses are best handled as close to home as possible.”
 He added, “In no way should our responses to any crisis violate the unalienable Constitutional rights Americans have sacrificed to preserve from the very beginning.”
 Page, on the other hand, believes the state should take an active role in protecting its citizens in the midst of a major health crisis.
 “In a pandemic like we are in now, and in the future, the government has a right and a responsibility to protect the people. If it is concerning the health and welfare of the people... we do need to have mandates,” he said. “When it comes to masks and social distancing, I think these mandates are appropriate. They are following the CDC guidelines and the scientific knowledge we have.”
 He added, “I fear that this pandemic is not over and it is coming back and we need to keep these mandates in place. We need to follow the guidelines that are established by the medical experts.”

They pledged to do that, they have said that in no uncertain terms, that they're going to work with the state in order to do that. I hope their commitment is sincere.

The financial wallop the coronavirus pandemic put on DeSoto County’s businesses has been especially felt in downtown Arcadia’s popular antiques trade, small shops, mom-and-pop restaurants, bars and hair salons.
 Business closings have occurred, some short-term and some for good. The first live “Early Bird” on Thursday outside on the porch of the DeSoto County Chamber of Commerce building brought the casualty picture into closer focus, as well as gave a better idea of needs that should be addressed in a unified way, said Debbie Wertz, chamber executive director.
 "It went really well," said Wertz. "The weather was beautiful. It couldn't have been more perfect — something went right in 2020."
 The 11-year-old organization, whose mission is to promote local businesses, has been hosting virtual Early Birds for members on Zoom and Facebook but had not had an actual membership gathering since the early spring onset of the pandemic and the shutdowns that followed.
 Wertz estimates about 35 to 40 people attended. The next is slated for Nov. 5, also at the chamber headquarters at 16 S. Volusia Ave.
 Going into the final months of 2020, Wertz is relieved that the DeSoto County Chamber won’t be hit with the 25 percent or more membership losses some chambers around Florida and elsewhere have had. She instead expects non- renewals among the organization’s approximately 300 members to be in the 10% to 15% range.
 “I sure don’t see it dropping 25%,” she said.
 Wertz said she and her eight-member board called every member after the pandemic arrived. Beyond checking with the members, the calls gave the chamber a way to direct members on where to get help.
 “We wanted to see if they needed help with the SBA or PPP,” Wertz noted, referring to the Small Business Administration and the Paycheck Protection Program, a pandemic-business stimulus initiative that granted forgivable loans to businesses able to maintain specific workforce numbers.
 “We pasted a lot of stuff on the weekly E-blasts about PPP instructions,” she said.
 Staying in touch paid off when it came time for the chamber’s annual fundraiser, held this year in mid-June featuring clay shooting at a local gun range which made it possible to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 The fundraiser, moved from its original March date, exceeded the previous year’s event, according to Wertz.
 Hands down the chamber’s biggest challenge, Wertz said, has been the isolation endured by the business community.
 Networking, the bread and butter of a business organization, had to be sacrificed, Wertz said.
 “People like to get together,” she said. “Not being face-to-face” hurt.
 Wertz said the pandemic’s pain has made it especially hard for restaurants and bars to survive, let alone make money.
 “They are just not seeing the people come out,” she said of business since the re-openings.
 Hairstylists lost a lot of business last year before the state forced a multi- week shutdown of salons. Northern visitors left early “and may not return,” Wertz noted.
   
 She said Arcadia’s antique shops are back — but not entirely. Some of the owners are elderly and scared to open, Wertz said.
 Losing the “Fourth Saturday” antique festivals was especially painful to the shop owners’ balance sheets.
 “Sometimes that Fourth Saturday would help your sales for the entire month,” the chamber chief said.
 Tara Poulton has kept an eye on local business in her role as DeSoto County visitor and economic development director. Poulton said it is unsurprising that some antique shops and restaurants in the Central Business District are still shuttered.
 “Even in good time nobody is flush with cash,” she said.
 She is eager to see the Fourth Saturday events resume. Those visitors not only leave their dollars here, they spread the word on the offerings of Arcadia and DeSoto County, Poulton said.
 The extent of the damage to the revenue side of DeSoto businesses won’t be fully know until sales tax collection totals for a few more months. Sales tax collections are always three months behind, county officials say.
 But collections that the state has remitted have been encouraging, according to Mandy Hines, DeSoto County administrator.
 “We expected a big hit in the sales tax, but that hasn’t happened – yet," she said.
 The county budget projects a 6% drop for the fiscal year on the inter- governmental transfers that include the county’s portion of the sales tax. The projections put the decline at about $300,000, going from $5.4 million to $5.1 million.
 DeSoto County has an allocation of $6.1 million in CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) stimulus money to assist distressed residents, businesses and nonprofits. The money is from $2.2 trillion of allocations Congress approved at the end of March.
 Poulton said the county is “trying to get the money into the hands of business owners” as well as residents and nonprofits squeezed hard by the pandemic. The county is also using the money to relieve food insecurity of residents with help from public food pantries, assisting families and delivering meals.
 Dubbed the Community Partner Mitigation Assistance, the program helps businesses cover the cost of slowing the spread of COVID-19 such as modifying a business’s building and grounds or helping the business provide laptops to enable employees to work from homes. Businesses can apply for grants of $10,000 to $15,000 to cover such costs, Poulton said.
 Wertz said the chamber has teamed with the county to help businesses apply for the coronavirus-related assistance.
 “We’re helping small businesses get their applications in,” she said, adding that half the businesses it has assisted are not chamber members.
 Businesses, Wertz said, are about to enter a period of change in which resourcefulness and creativity will be valuable assets.
 “New ways to market will be a huge advantage,” she said. “Things are going to look different for a while for everyone.”
