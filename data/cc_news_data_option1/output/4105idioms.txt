“The first scene of the music video we were shooting for a while. There was this food out. You could eat it. It was edible. But you shouldn’t eat it. It was sitting out. They were spraying this water, like glycerin. Every once in a while, when the director would yell ‘cut’ and we had a second to reset, somebody in the scene would eat the food. We all ended up eating the food. Doja had taken a bite of the chicken, and she was like, ‘Oh girl, I feel like it’s already getting to me. This food has been sitting out for a long time.’ It was so funny. The food actually didn’t taste that bad. But we definitely were scared we were going to get sick.”

That’s just the way reality TV was done in the past, and now people are so savvy and so smart, they demand more reality out of their reality TV, shockingly enough. Now you do see everything, warts and all. You see in Clare’s season, you see the awkward conversations, you see the rough parts. That’s what I love about the show now.

The Colorado Avalanche re-signed defenseman Ryan Graves to a three-year contract through the 2022-23 season.


  Financial terms were not announced.


  Graves led the league with a +40 plus/minus rating -- the highest ever by a defenseman in franchise history. He tallied 26 points (nine goals, 17 assists) in 69 games and added 150 blocked shots.


  In 15 playoff games, he added one goal and two assists and blocked 37 shots.


  "We're pleased to bring Ryan back for three more years," said Joe Sakic, Colorado's general manager. "He bolstered our offense on the back end and is a big, powerful defender who earned his way into a top role on our blue line this past season."


  The New York Rangers selected him in the fourth round (No. 110 overall) in the 2013 NHL Draft and traded him to the Avalanche in February 2018. He made his NHL debut in the 2018-19 season, playing in 26 games and scoring five points (three goals, two assists.)


  In 95 career games, he has recorded 31 points (12 goals, 19 assists).

The Panthers will not be able to resume football activity until Wednesday, Oct. 21.
 In the game on Oct. 6 against former Class AA power James Monroe, Tug Valley played from behind nearly the entire contest as they battled costly turnovers.
 The Panthers committed three turnovers in the first half to allow the visiting Mavericks to jump ahead to a 20-6 lead early in the second quarter.
 TVHS trimmed into the lead prior to the end of the first half however as All- State receiver Caleb May “Mossed” a James Monroe defender in the end zone on a pass from QB Joby Sorrell from 27-yards out for his second TD of the half to cut the lead to 20-14 going into the break.
 Coming out of the locker rooms, the Mavericks reached the end zone again following another Tug Valley turnover as QB Andrew Hazelwood ran it in from 20-yards out and extended the JM lead to 26-14.
 The silver-and-black wasted no time answering on their next drive as Sorrell once again looked May’s way and the seniors hooked up on a 19-yard scoring pass. The two-point try was no good but the Maverick lead was trimmed back to six at 26-20.
 After the Tug Valley defense forced a turnover on downs by James Monroe, they looked to claw away at the lead again as junior Jarrett Barker got involed in the passing game.
 Barker hauled in passes good for 20 and 23 yards and then capped off the drive as he hauled in a two-yard pass from Sorrell and waltzed into the end zone. The two-point try was once again no good but the game was knotted back up at 26 apiece.
 The Tug Valley defense then found their stride as they forced a turnover on downs, picked off a pass, and forced a punt on the next three James Monroe possessions.
 The Panther offense sputtered on their side of the ball however as they committed turnovers on three straight offensive possessions late in the third and early in the fourth quarter.
 The James Monroe offense finally regained its traction late in the fourth quarter as they mounted an eight play drive capped off by a TD on 2nd and goal from the 22 as Hazelwood lofted a pass up for running back Grant Lively who hauled it in between three Panther defenders for the score.
 James Monroe’s two-point try was unsuccessful however but the Mavs took the 32-26 lead with 4:35 left in the game.
 Now trailing again by six with time winding down, the Tug Valley offense took over at their own 46-yard line needing to find the end zone.
 Panther QB Joby Sorrell picked up two first downs with his legs on the drive, one of them being a run on 4th and 2, as he moved the Panthers into Maverick territory.
 After a false start on a Panther receiver put TV behind the chains in a 3rd down and 15 situation with less than two minutes to play in the game, coach Ford called a timeout to draw up the big third down play.
 Coach Ford drew up a beauty as the Panthers converted on a hook-and-lateral, also known as a hook-and-ladder, and not only picked up the first down, but also reached the end zone.

Gov. Jim Justice said Monday it’s “way premature” to consider lifting a six- month-old state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic, even though West Virginia’s color-coded risk assessment map shows 46 of the 55 counties are either lowest-risk green or low-risk yellow.
 “We are nowhere close to lifting our state of emergency,” Justice said during Monday's COVID-19 briefing. “We’ve got to stay as diligent as we possibly can. We’ve got to stay on our game.”
 West Virginia law gives governors broad powers during states of emergency, including the ability to amend or rescind rules and regulations; to assume procurement and appropriations authority; to suspend state laws; and to exercise all other powers and duties “necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.”
 The governor’s powers even extend to the authority to “suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages,” an authority Justice has exercised on two occasions during the pandemic by ordering all bars closed in Monongalia County.
 It also gives Justice authority to order the wearing of face masks in public and commercial indoor settings, a power he referred to Monday, saying, “I know everybody’s tired, and everybody’s sick and tired of wearing their masks.”
 Justice declared a state of emergency regarding the COVID-19 pandemic on March 16. Twelve days earlier, he had declared a state of preparedness, which gives the governor the same broad powers as a state of emergency, but only for 30 days.
 Asked Monday if the state's risk assessment map indicates the pandemic emergency has passed, Justice said, “We cannot drop our guard. As far as lifting this emergency thing, it’s way premature right now.”
 The risk assessment map, which measures counties’ risk level by either infection rate or positivity rate -- whichever is lower -- on Monday showed 35 counties in green, indicating the virus has been contained. An additional 12 counties were yellow, indicating a low risk of transmission.
 Only nine counties were red, orange or gold, denoting various levels of risk requiring higher levels of restrictions of public school activities.
 In sharp contrast, the latest Harvard Global Health Services risk assessment map, using data from Saturday, had three counties in highest-risk red and 20 counties in high-risk orange.
 The Harvard Global map, based on a rolling seven-day average of infections per 100,000 population, had no West Virginia counties in lowest-risk green Monday, and had 32 counties in yellow.

After several difficult years, area farmers say their hopes for a strong harvest and relatively strong markets are finally coming true in 2020.


  A light frost last weekend did little to disrupt harvest season. According to the Crop Progress report released last week, more than 60% of soybeans had been harvested, compared to a five year average around 40%.


  Unseasonably warm weather this week has made for ideal harvesting weather, said Steele County farmer Dan Deml. Roughly 80% of beans were rated by farmers as “good” or “excellent,” and Deml anticipates that farmers got most of them out by the end of the weekend.


  “It’s been an excellent week for soybean combines, with warmth and some dry breezes,” he said.


  When it comes to the market side of the equation, things aren’t ideal. Stronger than expected purchasing from China, once the U.S.’s primary soy buyer, has boosted prices up by a dollar or more, said local soybean farmer Keith Schrader.


  “It’s been a real good feeling to have prices come up,” Schrader said.


  USDA estimates of a bumper crop nationwide were trimmed a bit by drought in some places, along with a vicious derecho that hit Iowa, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage. That’s helped to keep oversupply from driving down prices too much.


  University of Minnesota Agriculture Extension Specialist Claire LaCanne’s reaction? A sense of relief. LaCanne contrasted this year’s harvest with last year’s, when just 10% of beans were harvested at this time and only 56% were in good or excellent condition.


  “Yields are looking good and moisture levels are as well,” she said.


  With the soybean harvest likely complete, Deml said local farmers are turning their attention to corn. Again, more than 80% of farmers have identified their corn crop as good or excellent, so as long as the weather remains cooperative, a strong local crop is on the way.


  Schrader noted that at around $3.50 a bushel, corn prices are nearing the level where farmers are able to break even. While that still isn’t an ideal situation, he said it’s a notable improvement compared to what they were recently.


  “We need just a little more (to make a profit), but about a month ago we were looking pretty sad,” he said.


  Corn prices were driven down earlier this year due a dramatic reduction in ethanol production. Coupled with an ill-timed oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, COVID-19 travel restrictions led to a large discrepancy between oil supply and demand.


  Rice County Farmers Union President Steven Read noted that farmers struggling to break even on their crops are benefiting from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s second round of Coronavirus Food Assistance Payments, known as CFAP.


  In January, President Donald Trump took significant steps to end the trade war that had marked the first three years of his administration, signing off on the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Free Trade Agreement and a Phase One Trade Deal with China. The deal was of particular importance to local farmers due to China’s role in the soybean market. Supporters said it could increase America’s agricultural exports to $50 billion and its overall exports by $200 billion.


  Before the deal was struck, China had shifted most of its purchases to Brazilian soybeans. While the Chinese have lived up to their commitment to increase purchases from the U.S. so far, Read said the market still hasn’t recovered to where it was.


  Clawing back all of the market share lost by U.S. farmers during the trade war will be a tall order. Even trying to do so, Read said, would likely require even more steps to open up trade between the two countries.


  “Until we change the trade situation with China, we’re not going to see a dramatic improvement,” he said.


  Whether those changes are made, Read added, will likely be decided by whoever wins the Presidential election. In the meantime, though, farmers like Deml are glad to see at least some improvement in their fortunes.


  “All in all we're looking good,” Deml said. “I think people will end up very satisfied.”

The robust schedule underscores the work Trump needs to do as he tries to win over voters just three weeks before Election Day. And it comes amid still- unanswered questions about the impact so much travel so soon could have on the 74-year-old president’s health. The progression of COVID-19 is often unpredictable, and there can be long-term complications.


  After Air Force One lifted off from Joint Base Andrews, the president’s doctor released an update on his health that said Trump had tested negative for the virus — and had done so on consecutive days. His doctor, Navy Cmdr. Scott Conley, said that the tests, taking in conjunction with other data, including viral load, have led him to conclude that Trump was not contagious.


  For days, the White House had sidestepped questions as to whether Trump had tested negative. Conley over the weekend said that the president met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for safely discontinuing isolation and that by “currently recognized standards,” Trump was no longer considered a transmission risk.


  Trump, eager to return to campaigning, says he is now “immune” to the virus — a claim that is impossible to prove given limitations in what scientists know about the coronavirus.


  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said Monday on CNN that those who recover from COVID-19 are likely to be immune for a limited period of time, but there are cases emerging of people getting reinfected weeks or months later.


  Fauci, speaking as Trump was prepared to depart the White House for Florida, questioned the wisdom of holding such an event. He noted that test positivity rates are climbing in parts of the Sun Belt.


  “We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that,” Fauci said.


  Some medical experts have also voiced skepticism that Trump could be declared contagion-free so soon. And it was unclear what — if any — added precautions and safety measures the campaign planned to take to prevent the trip from further spreading a virus that has already infected so many of the president’s closest aides and allies, including his campaign manager and the head of the Republican Party.


  Florida is seen as critical to Trump’s reelection chances. Trump narrowly beat his 2016 rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, in the state by just over 112,000 votes. Some recent polls have suggested a close race in the state, while others have put Democrat Joe Biden ahead.


  Trump’s decision to so quickly return to the campaign trail drew criticism from Biden and other Democrats.


  “President Trump comes to Sanford today bringing nothing but reckless behavior, divisive rhetoric, and fear mongering,” Biden said in a statement. “But, equally dangerous is what he fails to bring: no plan to get this virus that has taken the lives of over 15,000 Floridians under control.”


  Florida state Rep. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat who is running for state Senate and who recently recovered from his own COVID-19 infection, said in a conference call with reporters that Trump should not be coming to Florida.


  “It’s reckless and irresponsible,” Jones said.


  Florida lawyer Dan Uhfelder, who has dressed as the Grim Reaper on beaches to highlight the coronavirus threat, filed a lawsuit Monday trying to stop Trump from holding his Sanford rally. It sought to have the event classified as a public nuisance.


  Trump, for his part, is eager to show the world that he is no longer sidelined by a virus that he has consistently played down and that has killed 215,000 people across the nation.


  Since his release from a military hospital after three days of around-the- clock care that included access to experimental antibody treatments unavailable to the public, Trump has used his personal experience to try to convince the public that he was right all along.


  He has repeatedly told Americans who contract the virus that they’re “going to get better really fast,” although hundreds of people in the U.S. die of the virus every day.


  Trump held his first public event since his diagnosis on Saturday, addressing a crowd of hundreds of people on the South Lawn from a White House balcony. Appearing without a mask and with bandages still visible on his hands, likely from intravenous injections, Trump spoke for just 18 minutes — far less than his usual campaign rallies, which can last upwards of 90 minutes.


  He told the crowd the virus is “disappearing,” even as cases have been on the rise.

Cruises currently scheduled for December from those two homeports remain in place for the time being while Carnival evaluates options. However, guests booked on cruises in December out of Miami and Port Canaveral still have the ability to voluntarily cancel their reservation and receive the same offer that all other impacted guests are receiving, which includes a combination future cruise credit and onboard credit, or a full refund.

The robust schedule underscores the work Trump needs to do as he tries to win over voters just three weeks before Election Day. And it comes amid still- unanswered questions about the impact so much travel so soon could have on the 74-year-old president’s health. The progression of COVID-19 is often unpredictable, and there can be long-term complications.
 After Air Force One lifted off from Joint Base Andrews, the president’s doctor released an update on his health that said Trump had tested negative for the virus — and had done so on consecutive days. His doctor, Navy Cmdr. Scott Conley, said that the tests, taking in conjunction with other data, including viral load, have led him to conclude that Trump was not contagious.
 For days, the White House had sidestepped questions as to whether Trump had tested negative. Conley over the weekend said that the president met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for safely discontinuing isolation and that by “currently recognized standards,” Trump was no longer considered a transmission risk.
 Trump, eager to return to campaigning, says he is now “immune” to the virus — a claim that is impossible to prove given limitations in what scientists know about the coronavirus.
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said Monday on CNN that those who recover from COVID-19 are likely to be immune for a limited period of time, but there are cases emerging of people getting reinfected weeks or months later.
 Fauci, speaking as Trump was prepared to depart the White House for Florida, questioned the wisdom of holding such an event. He noted that test positivity rates are climbing in parts of the Sun Belt.
 “We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that,” Fauci said.
 Some medical experts have also voiced skepticism that Trump could be declared contagion-free so soon. And it was unclear what — if any — added precautions and safety measures the campaign planned to take to prevent the trip from further spreading a virus that has already infected so many of the president’s closest aides and allies, including his campaign manager and the head of the Republican Party.
 Florida is seen as critical to Trump’s reelection chances. Trump narrowly beat his 2016 rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, in the state by just over 112,000 votes. Some recent polls have suggested a close race in the state, while others have put Democrat Joe Biden ahead.

Whereas companies in need of financing flocked to private markets a couple of years ago, the public markets is their go-to right now, Misra said on a digital panel discussion. “Why would you take money from us when you can get better valuations from the public market with no strings attached?”
 The same market backdrop has fueled the popularity of SPACs. Misra described SPACs as an investment tool that would allow SoftBank to focus on one company, rather than a portfolio of companies.
 “Our problem is to find investment opportunities, not to raise capital. We have too much liquidity right now,” Misra said.
 “While a good, large company that was going to go public, will go the IPO route anyway, the SPAC is right for a good growth company that had plans to go public in a year or nine months and uses this window of buoyant capital markets,” Misra said.
 Misra wouldn’t confirm reports that SoftBank was the “Nasdaq whale,” reportedly buying up billions of dollars’ worth of call options in a series of trades that fed the run-up in technology stocks before the pullback in September.
 “Even us buying $10 billion of Nasdaq [stock] isn’t going to move the Nasdaq—not even a dolphin, forget about being a whale.”

West Virginians through the generations have marveled at the intermittent flashes of light that take place in the night skies of late spring and summer, as swarms of fireflies emerge from the ground to perform their annual bioluminescence-enhanced mating ritual.
 While such displays can be spectacular, particularly if large populations of fireflies are involved, imagine viewing a light show created by thousands of lightning bugs all flashing at the same time, at the same intervals.
 Such displays are created by synchronous fireflies, members of two or three of the 2,000 species of fireflies known to exist in North America. Until recently, synchronous fireflies could be found on public lands in the U.S. only in portions of Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, Pennsylvania’s Allegheny National Forest, the Oak Ridge Wildlife Management Area in east Tennessee, and South Carolina’s Congaree National Park.
 As of this year, Watoga State Park in Pocahontas County has joined that list.
 A now-retired Division of Natural Resources biologist happened to be visiting at Watoga during the 2019 firefly mating season and discovered what appeared to be a population of rare synchronous fireflies. She passed along information on the sighting, including the GPS coordinates for where it occurred, to Mack Frantz, State Zoologist for the DNR, who was organizing a study of firefly populations across West Virginia using data from citizen observations.
 Not long after learning about the possible West Virginia synchronous firefly population, Frantz said, the Watoga State Park Foundation contacted him about their Dark Sky Initiative, a project aimed at having Watoga designated as the state’s first Dark Sky Park.
 To qualify for the designation, a park must meet criteria established by the International Dark Sky Association. They include being able to see the Milky Way with the naked eye, having night sky brightness measured several times annually to meet qualifying standards, and having only a few domes of artificial light visible from the park, provided they are near the horizon.
 Park management must also be on board with protecting and promoting the dark sky as a resource for education and scientific study and to enhance habitat for light-avoiding wildlife species — like fireflies.
 “It was great timing to have work already underway to make Watoga a Dark Skies Park at the same time that a synchronous firefly population was observed in the park,” Frantz said.
 Ensuring that Watoga’s night skies remain as dark or even darker than present by modifying its outdoor lighting is expected to enhance the park’s ability to sustain resident fireflies.
 “Fireflies are extremely sensitive to light,” said Ken Springer of the Watoga State Park Foundation, who writes the “Watoga Trails Report,” a nature and history column, for the Pocahontas Times. “They don’t like to be around flashlights, headlights or bright outdoor lighting.”
 In mid-June, Springer was part of a small group led by Tiffany Beachy, biologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, who set out to confirm the presence of a synchronous firefly population at Watoga.
 Also participating were Mary Dawson with the Dark Sky Park project and Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park Superintendent Sam Parker.
 The group arrived at the spot where the suspected synchronous fireflies were seen at dusk in June 2019.
 “There were a lot of ferns and mosses there and a creek lined with rhododendron thickets,” Springer said. “I didn’t know what to expect. At first, what looked like regular fireflies came out and started flashing, but then all of a sudden, as if an invisible signal was given, they all started flashing as one. The synchronicity of all those fireflies just blows you away. How do they know how to flash at the same time? It was amazing. It went on for what seemed like about a half hour, and then, all at once, they just stopped.”

Yavapai County Sheriff’s officials said they received a 911 call Friday night about an overdue hiker in Boynton Canyon west of Sedona. Two men were hiking with 29-year-old Jordan Brashears and heading to see ancient ruins in the canyon. Authorities say the three men were about a half-mile from the Enchantment Resort on the east wall of the canyon near a set of ruins when Brashears went ahead of them. At that time, Brashears was hiking barefoot and his two companions lost sight of him around a corner. They called out and searched for at least an hour before contacting the sheriff's office. The body was found Saturday.

He urged the community to "control what we can control to protect ourselves from this virus and to make it possible to keep our schools open."


  WCS nurses maintain records of any students or school employees who exhibit possible COVID-19 symptoms. Elliott said an "investigation" may take place when people do not pass the screening procedures when they enter the school, but most case investigations occur when someone self reports to the nurse.


  "One thing that seems to be getting across to people is to monitor themselves and their children for COVID-19 symptoms and to immediately self-isolate if they are symptomatic or if they have been a close contact to a known positive," Elliott said.


  When a student or employee is identified COVID-19 positive, school nurses conduct interviews with the person to identify anyone who has been a close contact 48 hours prior to the positive test or the onset of symptoms. A close contact is defined as being within six feet of someone for a cumulative 15 minutes or longer in a 24-hour period. Elliott said the contact tracing process is vitally important in order to identify everyone who might have come in contact with an infected person to then stop or slow the chain of further transmission.


  According to Elliott, the spike in school cases were the result of activities outside of school where health and safety precautions were not being followed.


  "I know we all want life to be as normal as possible and we are all taking a risk in anything we do," Elliott said. "But we can minimize our risks by wearing masks, keeping appropriate distance — including with each other at work — washing your hands, regularly monitoring yourself for symptoms and immediately self-quarantining when symptomatic or after a close contact."


  Elliott added that the biggest reason for the increase in case investigations and positive cases among school-age students last week was related to a community-based travel basketball program. Several athletes in the program were identified as being in close contacts to other students during outside of school activities, Elliott said. WCS suspended athletic practices in both football and basketball for one week to give school nurses time to thoroughly work through the contact tracing procedures as a precautionary measure.


  The school system is requiring mandatory testing for athletes who are identified as close contacts and are in isolation. Athletes who are symptomatic are required to have a negative laboratory test rather than a rapid antigen test, or to be cleared by their doctor, before returning to play, according to Elliott. Athletes who have tested positive must test negative or be cleared by a doctor before coming back to play for the school.


  Elliott said he is proud of the safeguards WCS coaches have put into place in school-based practices, as so far the school system has no known cases of transmission as a result of school-based athletics.


  "The cases involving outside of school athletics made it clear how involved and connected our students and coaches are to one another even outside of school," Elliott said. "The additional testing requirements I am implementing are an added safeguard intended to ensure that all athletes who are close contacts go get tested whether they are symptomatic or not."


  In the email, Elliott reminded employees that free tests can be obtained from AppHealthCare, and that several providers in the area are providing "rapid" antigen tests for a cost. However, he advised those who are symptomatic or concerned about being a close contact to get the "more reliable laboratory test" from AppHealthCare or a medical provider.


  Going forward, students or employees who are actively symptomatic and have a negative antigen test result will also need to provide either a negative laboratory test result or a note from a medical provider before returning to school, according to Elliott.


  "This is to provide further safeguards that a COVID-19-positive person does not return to school due to a false negative antigen test," Elliott said.


  Elliott reiterated that while other school systems are moving forward with Plan A — with full attendance — for grades K-5, WCS does not plan to do so at this time. School officials continue to implement a Plan B operation on a 2x2 flex plan — a hybrid in-person and remote learning schedule — while also monitoring the impact of local cases on school operations.


  In conversations with other superintendents across the state and in the region, Elliott said most school systems are not posting a regular dashboard update. Instead, they are notifying the public of any clusters of cases in schools as well as notifying close contacts — which WCS plans to do as well.


  Rather than a dashboard, Watauga County Schools plans to post a COVID-19 update with an infographic of data each Friday. The information can be found at _www.wataugaschools.org/Page/4481_.


  "While our numbers are currently relatively low, I want to share information with the public to help reassure our community that we are working hard to monitor and address suspected cases in order to prevent further spread at school," Elliott said.

It wasn’t necessarily a thing of beauty, but the Houston High School football team notched a nonconference road victory Friday night by taking a four-hour bus ride and beating Midway 14-7 at Cleveland, Mo.


  “That one wasn’t pretty,” said HHS head coach Eric Sloan, “but we’ll take them any way we can get them right now.”


  As has been the case in every outing so far in 2020, Houston had to deal with turnovers in the contest, as the Tigers gave the host Vikings the ball twice on fumbles and once on an interception. Both fumbles came in the first quarter, once on the first drive of the game on a play right after junior running back Zach Fuwell had scampered 35 yards to the Midway 35-yard line, and again on a high snap at the Vikings’ 33-yard line as the Tigers offense was in the midst of a sustained drive.

“We went back the next night and took chairs to watch the show,” Dawson said. “We were like little kids when the Christmas lights are first turned on.”
 Annual light displays produced by mating synchronous fireflies draw tens of thousands of visitors annually to the parks where they are known to occur.
 At Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, a lottery system was established in 2015 to limit the number of people visiting a viewing area providing the best look at the light show to 800 to 1,000 visitors per night. In 2019, more than 29,000 people signed up to view the display, which lasts only a few weeks.
 To keep spectators from inadvertently trampling the ground from which female lightning bugs watch the display, or using flashlights, which can disrupt the males’ flashing sequences, visitors are shuttled by bus from a parking lot to an access path near the viewing site.
 The Allegheny National Forest, where a population of synchronous fireflies was discovered in 2011, is the location for the annual Pennsylvania Firefly Festival, during hundreds of visitors go on guided hikes to prime observation areas.
 More than 12,000 visitors flocked to Congaree National Park in South Carolina to view synchronous firefly displays last year, when a shuttle system was initiated to ease traffic congestion.
 Synchronous firefly viewing activities at all three parks were canceled this year due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
 After Watoga’s first synchronous firefly population was verified in June, Jody Spencer, the park’s superintendent, found a second population of the flashy creature elsewhere in the 10,100-acre park. A third West Virginia population was identified this year at a site along the Greenbrier River Trail, according to Frantz.
 Synchronous fireflies are found in humid forest settings adjacent to creeks or rivers, at elevations higher than 2,000 feet.
 There is an abundance of such habitat on public land in West Virginia, Frantz said, with the 921,000-acre Monongahela National Forest being a prime candidate.
 “There have been at least two credible reports of synchronous fireflies in the Monongahela,” Frantz said. “Who knows? It could turn out that West Virginia has more synchronous fireflies than any other state.”
 Springer said Spencer is excited about prospects for both the Dark Sky Park designation for Watoga and attracting more visitors to the park to see the synchronous firefly displays.
 “Without COVID, I would assume Watoga could begin offering a few guided firefly tours as early as next June,” Frantz said.
 Fireflies, actually members of the beetle family, have been in decline in recent years, with habitat loss and light pollution suspected as primary causes. To get a handle on West Virginia’s firefly population and range, Frantz inaugurated the DNR’s Light Up West Virginia Survey, which enlists citizen observers to report data on firefly sightings across the state. Between 20 and 40 species of firefly are believed to exist in West Virginia.

SOUTH LAKE TAHOE (AP) — A woman who drowned after falling off a boat carrying six children in a lake straddling Northern California and Nevada has been identified as Daisy Rogers of El Paso, Texas, authorities said Monday. The El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office in California said Rogers, 30, was in a boat traveling back to South Lake Tahoe from Emerald Bay on Friday when she went to the back of the boat and accidentally fell off. The office said that another adult on the boat attempted to save her but failed. El Dorado Sgt. Anthony Prencipe said he had no details to release on the condition of the other adult or any other witnesses on the boat. The office was notified around 7 p.m. and Rogers was found by the U.S. Coast Guard about two hours later. She was taken to a hospital but later pronounced dead. The Tahoe Douglas Fire Protection District in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, tweeted Friday that a woman had drowned and that a man who jumped in to save her was suffering from severe hypothermia. The district tweeted that six children on board the drifting boat were rescued. The district's Fire Marshal Eric Guevin told The Sacramento Bee that Rogers likely went into shock from the water’s cold temperature, which is around 62 degrees (17 Celsius) this time of year.

Oklahoma State is dealing with its second postponement this season.


  The season opener against Tulsa was scheduled for Sept. 12 but was pushed back a week because of Tulsa’s issues with COVID-19. The Cowboys completed practice on Sunday in preparation for Saturday’s game against Baylor before hearing the news that Baylor’s COVID-19 issues forced the game to be moved to Dec. 12.


  OSU coach Mike Gundy said nothing is surprising in this unusual season.


  “You just kind of roll with the punches,” Gundy said. “When we started this, we felt like we could run into a game or two where there could be COVID issues on our team or another team. We’ve been working on Baylor for a week. You take that put that in the filing cabinet and you open up for Iowa State.”

The Falcons shouldn't slam the door on moving other assets, too. A Miami Dolphins-style roster deconstruction might seem unappealing on paper, but teams that accumulate bountiful assets can accelerate their rebuilds with smart hiring and good draft decisions. Jones would surely be attractive to a contending team right now. The Falcons have to at least listen if someone calls. It is trading short-term pain -- a sell-off would almost certainly torpedo interim coach Raheem Morris' chance to win the job full-time -- for the potential of long-term, sustained gain.

This one’s a long shot. But what if Shauna was able to so convincingly throw Quinn under the bus that Eric blamed his missus more for the Ridge fiasco than he did his ex-daughter-in-law? Eric, being forgiving to a fault, might decide to wipe the slate clean and hire Shauna as Forrester Creations’ new secretary, putting her in the perfect position to eavesdrop and butt in — _and_ remind Ridge at every turn both how sorry she is and how attractive she is. Again, it’s a long shot. But you have to admit, it’s a recipe for fun. And you just _know_ Quinn wouldn’t be able to resist “helping” Brooke run late for a runway show, thus necessitating Shauna going on in her place!

The 49ers now trail the Seahawks by three games in the NFC West and have a quarterback conundrum after coach Kyle Shanahan benched starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo﻿, who was playing in his first game since missing two games with a high ankle sprain, at halftime Sunday. Shanahan kept throwing the ball every down late in the first half, aggressively taking a timeout with 30 seconds left at his own 25-yard line to give Jimmy G. more chances in what amounted to a test that Garoppolo failed. The quarterback did not look fully recovered from his injury, another new problem popping up just as the 49ers got their starting skill-position group back together again. Their offensive line is not communicating or blocking well. Quarterback C.J. Beathard has played in two straight games off the bench, which is never a good sign. Without a dominant defensive line, the 49ers' injuries in the secondary have been exposed. And now the schedule presents a massive problem.

  ROME, Oct 12 (Reuters) - After decades locked away in a basement, some of the finest sculptures from antiquity have been pulled from the gloom and returned to public view in Rome.


  Busts of Roman emperors, intricate sarcophagi and an ancient Greek relief carved 2,500 years ago are just some of the 92 pieces on display in the city's Palazzo Caffarelli.


  The marbles belong to the aristocratic Torlonia family and represent a fraction of their 620 sculptures, believed to be the largest such private collection in the world.


  "We could do seven, eight, 15 more exhibitions," said art historian Salvatore Settis, who was picked by the family to help curate the show and had the difficult task of deciding which works should see the light of day.


  Like many leading Rome families, the Torlonias initially put their huge collection on display in a museum. But after 101 years, they locked its doors in 1976, looking to convert the building into private apartments.


  "The reappearance of such a legendary collection is a very important event," said Settis. "When I saw them for the first time it was very emotional because I knew most of those pieces from books, but I had never seen them."


  The Torlonias, who built their wealth off the back of papal contracts, snapped up established collections, some dating back to the 15th century, and built up a collection of collections.


  Among the pieces on view is a fountain basin carved in ancient Greece that was believed to have stood in the garden of Julius Caesar when it was already considered an antiquity.


  Many of the works have undergone substantial restoration over the years, including a statue of a goat whose body dates to the first century AD but whose head is believed to have been created by the famed 17th century Italian sculptor Bernini.


  Anna Maria Carruba helped prepare the statues for the exhibition.


  "Many of these pieces were already restored from 1600 onwards. We didn't need to work on the structure of the statues but only on the surfaces, cleaning them, removing the dust that had accumulated over the years and materials used in previous restorations," she said.


  The "Torlonia Marbles" show had been due to open in April, but was pushed back because of the coronavirus. It runs in Rome until June 2021 and is expected to move on to at least one other European country and the United States before returning to Italy where it will be given a permanent home.

I’m sure you do.

"Well, I love Matt, much like I love Dan and Thomas," Blank began, somewhat ominously considering the fate that has befallen the latter pair. "Matt has been a franchise leader for us, a great quarterback, one of the leading quarterbacks in the last 13 years in the NFL. So, I hope he's going to be part of our plans going forward. But that will be a decision I won't make. Matt has the ability to play at a very high level, even at his age. Whether that's going to continue or not, I'm not sure. I appreciate his willingness to consider doing that and, the level of what he's played for 13 years, which has been incredible. So, we'll have to see. But, then again, that's going to be a decision that at the end of the day will be up to the player and the coaching staff. And whether or not Matt can keep himself together, and God willing, he'll be able to do that and play at the level he's capable of playing at."

The plan was evident, but the Rebels struggled to stop the run, losing the battle at the line of scrimmage early.
 “We’re weak up the middle on defense and everybody has found that out now. We knew coming in their backs were going to be strong,” Tolsia coach Eric Crum said. “We have to be better up front.”
 But that didn’t keep the Rebels out of the game. Sandwiched in between the two Miner drives was a 17-yard touchdown pass from Tolsia’s Jesse Muncy to Zach Ball, which kept the game within reach for the Rebels, tying the game at 6-6.
 After Scales’ go-ahead score with 7:22 left until halftime, Muncy threw an interception on a long pass intended for Zach Ball, who’s feet were tangled with the defender, causing him to fall to the ground before he could attempt to make the catch.
 A mere 40 seconds was expired on the Tolsia drive, and Mingo Central used a 10-play 56 yard scoring drive to take a double-digit lead into halftime. Zion Martin scored to extend the lead to 22-6. The scoring chance was set up by an 18-yard scramble from Goad on 4th-and-13.
 But despite trailing by two touchdowns at halftime, Tolsia recovered an onside kick and scored, then forced a Mingo Central fumble and drove back down the field to tie the game at 22-22, stealing back the momentum from the visitors.
 The third period came and went without a change of score and the game remained tied at 22 until another timely conversion on 4th down from Goad. Facing 4th- and-4 at the Tolsia 18, Goad moved around in the pocket before finding Scales in the endzone for the eventual game-winning touchdown.
 “Our guys are good at responding in situations like that. It’s about winning the next play,” Mingo Central coach Josh Sammons said. “Stuff is going to happen, like the onside kick, we talked about that all through halftime and they still got it, but I’m proud of our guys tonight.”
 Just when it looked like the Rebels might make a move following the score, things went from great to bad to worse, all in one play.
