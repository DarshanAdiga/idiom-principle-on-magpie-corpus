Philips, who lives in the Treasure Valley where the coronavirus has hit hard, said he is seeing people taking advantage of the warmer weather and getting outside.
 To keep anglers busy, Philips said Fish and Game workers will continue stocking rivers, reservoirs and community ponds as usual. However, because COVID-19 has put the government entity in a state of flux, they will be unable to provide exact dates and locations when fish will be stocked. Philips acknowledged some anglers depend on the fish stocking forecast to find the best spots, but said for the time being, they will have to be patient.

As we head into the start of next week, exactly how these pieces of the forecast puzzle behave is still a bit up in the air, but we know the subtropical system will lift northeast and be absorbed into the jetstream. The trough will continue to dive southeast, bringing cooler air to the Eastern US. The upper level low in Texas could drift into the Gulf and re-emerge across the Central Gulf Coast, or drift more easterly. Either way, this could aid in rain chances Sunday and Monday.

I might add that these types of projects are a result of our relentless focus on geology and our willingness to go take projects from scratch to production, as well as opportunistically and decisively acquire assets that are synergistic with existing assets.

 "I can still look presentable on a conference call and feel comfortable at the same time," she said of the bodysuit. "It also gives off a very sleek, put- together vibe."
 Although DeSorbo is having fun sharing photos of her outfits on Instagram, she also admitted that she misses dressing up for a day spent out and about.
 "I miss my regular NYC life, where I would go to a meeting and then be walking by a Zara and just popping in to see what they have," she said. "I'm one of those people who plans my outfits the night before if I have to do something, so I miss putting outfits together and trying things on."

A: I think a lot of the things we’re trying to build within the culture right now are showing up based on the circumstances that we have allotted to us and how hard the players are working. That’s really what we’re looking to build, is that culture of everyone doing whatever it takes to be successful. Right now, we’re seeing that across the board with our players. I’m very pleased in how they come every day prepared. I’m pleased with how they come every day with a lot of urgency. We’re getting great feedback and communication through the meetings with the players themselves. As far as building comradery with them, probably the best part of the day is when you can click on the Zoom and everyone has their screens unmuted and you just hear the guys talking across. That’s probably the best part. It took about a week for everybody to get comfortable enough to do that. I think they kind of realize, as coaches, we’re laughing listening to them talk and then they got a little bit more comfortable and really started breaking it down. It’s fun seeing all of the personalities really emerge and the connections. Today was the first day we had the rookies in the meetings with the vets, so you could tell right away, a couple guys saw some new faces and you heard a couple others, ‘Rookies in here today.’ I’m sure they’ll be asking them for a joke by tomorrow.

I have to pick two people. My parents for sure. I genuinely feel like I won the parental lottery with the amount of wisdom and knowledge that has been imparted to me.

People are naturally drawn to them because they can sense that my parents want to see them succeed. I think you can have a lot of textbook qualities that make you a good leader, but unless you have a heart for the people you are leading, people won’t follow you unless they have to or are forced to.

I’m going to work my way through the team as we go throughout the rest of spring, making sure I get face time with each one of these guys. Leading up to this, I spent some time talking to these guys on the phone really just checking on them and their family. I had the opportunity to meet a lot of these guys in person when we were still in the building. They were still around working out. I would say one of the interesting things about this whole process is just like we’re doing right now, as somebody else is speaking, really everyone has the freedom to look around right now and really observe how people are. When there’s an assistant coach presenting, everybody in there is also presenting themselves and how they conduct themselves in a meeting. You’re looking around, how’s the guy set up in his house? Is it a quiet setting? How is he dressed? What’s his eye focus like? Are his eyes down? Is he trying to text? We haven’t had a lot of that. We’ve had a lot of guys with great urgency. You have the opportunity in this setting here to really see your players in a meeting standpoint where they really can’t hide. Right now, we’re on a one by one box on this screen, but we’re all face to face. You don’t know who’s looking at who at this time, so everything you’re doing at all times is really what you’re being evaluated on.

We estimate these new mines will produce with an average mine cost in the low $60 per ton and require additional development CapEx of approximately $11 million. This could poise us to potentially increase our production level to as much as 3 million tons next year. That is about 66% above 2020 production levels, and would break down as roughly 2.1 million tons of high-vol from Elk Creek and 900,000 tons of low-vol from Berwind and Knox Creek. Again, we will not green light these projects until we see better market clarity, but we obviously like the relatively low CapEx, low-mine cost and short lead time to add some meaningful production.


--DocBreak--
Yeah, I think Dave if I understood your question correctly, it relates mostly to our Berwind slope and we've probably got another $5 million or $6 million to spent at Berwind to get to our Pocahontas 4 Seam. So we have stopped that spent, and when we turn it on we got another kind of a five to six months’ worth of work to get to that seam. So you know round it up, call it $1 million a month, round numbers, once we decided to green light that.


--DocBreak--
We have also added two new low-vol and mid-vol mining projects, which we refer to as the Triad and the Big Creek mines, where relative with little CapEx we could bring on these two new mines within four months from breaking ground. When we combine them with Berwind, then within [ph] six months of the clear market landscape and of course a green light from our Board, we could add roughly 1.2 million tons of additional low and mid-vol coal and heat production. This would normalize to about 900,000 tons of annual production on an ongoing basis and compares to our current low-vol run rate of about 200,000 tons.

Every leader, whether you are junior associate or a senior leader, has a leadership style.
   
 Your leadership style is based on many factors to include your values, personality, attitude and your priorities in life.
   
 How you develop and improve your style has big implications on your success in a business environment.
   
 Therefore, a leader must make a conscience, proactive effort to understand his/her leadership style, evaluate that style's effectiveness, and make improvements.
   
 Several years ago, during an interview, a senior leader was asked a familiar question. "What is your leadership style?" In answering the question, the leader responded, "it depends on who I am leading." A true statement, but even if you alter your leadership techniques based on those you are leading, leaders must still be self-aware of their leadership style. A leader's leadership style affects the organization's culture, business success, and long-term decision-making.
   
 As described in many leadership books, there are different leadership styles such as democratic, autocratic, transformational, bureaucratic, and many more. While important to study these defined styles, the most important leadership style to study is your style. Your leadership style is your personal ability and approach to influence others to accomplish a task, selflessly serve their community, and sacrifice their time and talent for others.
   
 Developing your leadership style requires self-awareness in two areas.
   
 First, leaders must understand what is important to the business and the team, clearly articulate your and the organization's priorities, and then visualize priority accomplishment.
   
 Second, with the understanding of priorities, conduct a self-evaluation of your personal leadership style and determine what traits are critical in leading your team. Many historical leaders are known for specific styles they used to motivate people and accomplish the mission.
   
 Your optimal leadership style will depend on which specific traits you develop to lead your organization. Provided are a few leadership style traits for consideration.
   
 ◆ Setting the example. Every leader sets an example; in the long run, actions do speak louder than words. All organizations have values, procedures, policies, and expectations. Leaders are expected to demonstrate their knowledge in these areas and show, through their example, their commitment to the organization's values and mission. As a leader progresses in seniority, the spotlight never stops shining on your actions whether at work, leisure, or home.
   
 ◆ Communication. Effective leaders communicate a clear message with team members, customers, the community and families. To effectively communicate, deliberate practice is critical. At every opportunity, ask for feedback from trusted partners.
   
 ◆ Leading from the front. Many times, the leader isn't the expert in a specific task, but that shouldn't prevent him/her from demonstrating their desire to lead, learn and drive the team in accomplishing the task.
   
 ◆ Team player. Every leader needs the desire to excel. In fact, our culture is built around the belief of merit-based recognition and promotions, but the ultimate team recognition comes from cooperating with other teams for the greater organizational good.
   
 ◆ As you develop your personal leadership style, the next step is to focus your efforts on your team, the organization and the path to the organization's vision. As your team serves the organization, ask yourself this simple question, "how is your team going to be remembered?" Provided are a few examples of team leadership traits for consideration.
   
 ◆ Ensure your team adds valued to the business every day. In today's competitive environment, a self-motivated leader with a trained and effective team can have a significant impact on the business's success, every day.
   
 ◆ Set your subordinates up for success. Don't micromanage, but do ensure subordinates have the knowledge and resources to be successful. Be there when they need guidance, and give the team room to operate and learn from their experiences.
   
 ◆ Solve your higher boss' problems. A motivated leader understands the big picture, not just his/her team's responsibility, and when appropriate, the leader proactively provides solutions to the business's problems.
   
 In conclusion, there are three questions to ask yourself to determine if you have an effective leadership style. First, do team members reach out to you for advice, are they receptive to your direction, and do they give their all to the team and the mission? Second, do you have a good relationship with your peers; are you and your team part of a larger team that is focused on business success? Finally, do others want to join your team; do others see a cohesive team, focused on the business's mission, and a team that cares for each other?
   
 Enjoy your time as a leader. Every day, embrace the challenges, enjoy the opportunities, and focus on your team and the business's success. In leadership, there is not better experience than leading a team to successfully complete a mission while preparing the next generation of leaders.

Third, try something new. We discuss attachment theory in Mission 7, and part of becoming a more secure individual is getting out of your comfort zone to do things that feel vulnerable or awkward but in the long run, contribute to relationship satisfaction. For example, say you have an avoidant attachment style, and naturally gravitate toward keeping others at arm’s length. Intimacy exercises with a partner, such as answering personal questions or doing yoga together, can develop a more secure bond. Surprisingly, some research shows that even though avoidant partners rated these experiences negatively (“Partner yoga? That sounds awful! No way am I doing that!”), they still rated their relationship as higher-quality afterward. What’s more, they continued to self-disclose more than usual over the next 10 days, and continued to have lower levels of avoidance a month after the exercise.

Keeping an end of day log of what went well today and what seemed challenging today can enhance reflective capacity and bring awareness to day-to-day living. Once we have an idea of the current state of life, we can start coming up with strategies for doing things differently. I recommend starting with small steps — doing one thing a day differently that will increase being more mindful and feeling more serene. Then, at the end of the day, reflect: how did that make me feel? If it made you feel good, you’ll be more likely to keep doing it as it will become an important part of daily living. As these feel- good strategies start to take up more of our time, it becomes a lifestyle versus one more thing to add to our day.

A: I don’t know that we necessarily have an option to do it in the spring unless the league gives a thumbs up on that. I think right now with the climate of the country, one thing we have to consider is, first off, the safety of our players traveling across the country. Getting on flights, traveling through cars. There is a lot of mandated quarantines that come with that as well, so the timeliness factor of getting players, having them travel, the amount of time they’re quarantined, getting them in the building, can we secure that they’re going to be quarantined along with all of the staff and coaches that are surrounding them, whether that’s in our facility or somewhere else? There are a lot of logistical things we have to consider. The first thing we talked about in all of these conversations is are we 100 percent certain the players are going to remain healthy and we’re not putting anybody at risk. I have a tough time right now asking a player to fly across the country from California when I probably wouldn’t be the first one most willing to throw my two sons on a plane to go the other way. We talk about this, we have to consider the big picture of what’s going on. Look, I would love to have them in Jersey right now. I would love for us to have setup remote camp if that’s what was necessary. But getting them to the campus and making sure that while we’re there they’re not exposed to anything, we have to consider that as well.

1. Minimize the amount of exposure you have to all media, including television and screen time. Choose a trusted source for news and read articles, versus watching videos or live updates. Stay current on events but limit your news intake to two times per day. I have found that when I mindlessly look at social media or have the television running that there is sensory overload which is highly stimulating and evokes fear responses. We don’t experience the same sensory overwhelm when reading the written word versus seeing and hearing it on a screen.   2. Spend time outside daily. Look up at the sky and broaden your perspective to take in the landscape around you. Close your eyes and notice the smells, breeze on your skin, and sounds of nature. I live near the ocean and I make a point to spend time on the beach daily (no matter the weather). The sounds, smells, and sights help me to be in the moment and recognize the larger scope of all life as it lives on this planet. My daily world seems less significant when I ponder and expose myself to the vastness of the natural world.   3. Start your morning reading something inspiring. Avoid looking at a screen for the first 30 minutes of your day. I wake up early enough to read 3–4 pages of an inspirational book to set the tone for my day.   4. Practice being quiet and still, with the eyes closed and focus on the breath. I do this after I read, but it can be done at any time during the day. Start with 1 minute (you can use a timer). Commit to sitting, eyes closed, quietly observing your breath. When ready, increase to 2 minutes, then 3. You might build up to 10 minutes, but don’t make it a goal. Simply practice sitting quietly and following your breath and naturally, you’ll crave more time doing this.   5. When you find yourself overwhelmed or in a negative state, write down all of your concerns on a piece of paper or in a journal. Free write without editing, just to get it all out. After writing down concerns, evaluate which ones you could actually have an influence on. Take a moment to reflect, how much time do you spend thinking/worrying about these concerns? Next to the ones that you can do something about, record 1 -2 things that you will do to shift the concern so that it loses its power. Reflect again, wouldn’t it be a better use of your mental time and energy to focus on things you can influence versus the concerns you can’t do much about? Every thought creates a mental map for better or for worse. Spending time in a proactive state vs a reactive state will rewire your mind and prime you toward creative solutions. When we are in a fear state, we activate the parts of the brain that create more stress and worry. When we are in a solution state, we broaden and build our thought repertoires towards creativity, flexible thinking, and inviting social support.

Alright, so we’ve talked about both the Jawbone at our Knox Creek operation and expanding the Elk Creek preparation plant and each would provide about a 0.5 million tons annual production once we started these projects. Just rough numbers, you know somewhere between $10 million and $12 million for the Elk Creek plant expansion and a little bit more than that primarily related to mining equipment for the Jawbone expansion, when we green light these projects.

Diversifying our product offering too quickly. We got a little carried away on the back of the first taste of success and diversified into products we should not have at the time. We could quite easily have lost the business as a result which wasn’t really a funny mistake! However, looking back it is in-line with the entrepreneurial mindset of always expediting all aspects of the business. The lessons learnt are to be patient in the early stages and when you think you are ready for a new product offering, do what you are really good at for another year and double down on it in my opinion.

And so, our Stay At Home with Savaria campaign, it's really pushing all of those elements, because not everybody might be building a new home or B, having the means to put a Vuelift, but maybe the stairlift could be for them or maybe a porch lift. So, I think it's -- we're pushing the entire categories of home. And so longer term, I don't know exactly what it means in terms of our sales, one, two, three, four years down the road. But there is this baby boomer population that -- the oldest baby boomers, those born in 1945 are 75 years old now. And so we have a big kind of a wave that's coming in front of us of these baby boomers that will likely look to stay at home, if possible as opposed to going into some sort of skilled nursing facility or long-term care facility.

We may be a little early to have changed the world for the better thus far. I would love to be asked this question in years to come. We are socially conscious in that we have internal objectives as a company to minimize packaging, making our packaging recyclable and from recycled materials. This should be par for the course for business owners in 2020 and beyond.

Normally, more than 500 dancers train at Dance Centre Kenya’s network of studios in Nairobi, and the school works with Artists for Africa to support talented dancers from low-income families.

One concern is that COVID-19 might increase existing inequalities in the Canadian labour market. For example, if minimum wage earners lost their jobs, it could affect their ability to pay for rent or other essentials. Knowing which workers are more affected will help guide effective policy recommendations.

The off-road life is a tough gig in the long run, though, and most of these bikes were flogged hard and put away wet. Most SL70s have disappeared, and the remainders are in rough shape. The bike that’s being auctioned off is in immaculate shape—rare for anything from the ‘70s, even more rare for something that was intended to be run wide open across a corn field There are less than 150 miles on the odometer, and the ad indicates the bike spent its life gathering cobwebs at a vacation home in Virginia. If you’ve got the cash to buy it, this is probably the nicest example of an SL70 you’ll find outside a museum.

As I think about the pre-covid world and the current one in which the main topic of discussion is COVID it seems difficult to imagine that just a few months ago we were listing out our New Year Resolutions. Corona has put paid to all of that but it’s our determination to triumph that is keeping us going. So I made a few COVID resolutions to help us during these bleak times.

Of course! It’s my pleasure! I was born in a relatively small town in Scotland, and my parents felt a calling to America. We had no connections here. Just packed up, pursuing the quintessential American dream and lived in a tiny apartment in the bottom of a church in Norcross, Georgia. It was humble beginnings, to say the least. My dad (Sam) has always worked for himself (since he was 10 years old) and encouraged us to be entrepreneurs. One of the many things I love about my mom and dad is that they never associated fear with starting a business. They never made us feel like it was a scary thing, or that we couldn’t do it. They made it seem exciting, challenging and in many ways life-changing, for you/your family and others.

The root of this quote dates back to Confucius about 2,000 years ago apparently but was made famous in the 1960s by Gary Player the champion golfer. It was relevant to me in that I have had to work extremely hard in all stages of my life to achieve the goals I have set myself both as a sportsperson and in business.

I would love to talk more about our excitement and vision for Idaptive, but we have limited time today and I’ll move on how our COVID-19 response is progressing. We delivered uninterrupted customer support, while transitioning our staff to remote locations providing 24/7 service and ensuring customers and partners had the resources required to help keep their businesses up and running.

And then something remarkable happened. We began to see the people we work with in their own environments — in home settings with partners, children and pets. Some of our co-workers showed up with bedhead. Others wore hoodies.

A few days later, Ukrainian Airline Flight 752 was shot down by Iranian missiles, killing everyone on board — including dozens of Canadians who were closely affiliated with universities across Canada. Here again, at a meeting with colleagues, I didn’t bring up this tragedy. Despite the fact many Canadian academic institutions had just experienced a staggering loss of brilliant minds and their potential to improve our world, it wasn’t addressed by me or anyone else in the room.

I hesitate to put any names down. There are so many inspiring founders, I’d love to meet every single one and hear their journey. I’m always grateful for the stars that reply to my cold outbounds and are willing to give their time for a relative nobody. On the other hand, I’ve also come across those who say they support a cause — whether education, female founders, or social entrepreneurship — and haven’t been so supportive. In either case, it’s a twofold reminder for myself. First, that I’m often also guilty of putting others on the back-burner. I’m working on becoming a better source for support. And second, not to get offended. Feeling disillusioned implies I’m somehow entitled to a reply, or, because of someone’s stated cause, they owe a reply to everyone else with a similar purpose. The reality is everyone has limitations on time and different ways to attack a problem for good. In the early days, I think it’s important to find those that jump on board with your vision, and practice empathy but not get too bogged down with the rest.
