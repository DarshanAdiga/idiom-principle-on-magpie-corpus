Whipple and Fjord Chief Creative Officer Mark Curtis recently detailed what they call "five new human truths that experiences need to address" after the pandemic: an overall erosion of confidence; a shift to virtual work; a desire to stay close to home; the emergence of a health economy with opportunities for all; and, depending on how governments handle the crisis, the reemergence or decline of top-down authority.

ALLENTOWN, Pa. - Eventually there will come a time when athletes are able to train and compete again after the coronavirus pandemic, and now the goal for those athletes should be to try and better themselves during this time.


  According to Dr. Jarrod Spencer, athletes can come out stronger from this tough time.


  "Yeah, athletes are going out stronger on the other side of this," Spencer noted. "The reason is because this pandemic is actually forcing them to become more well-rounded. The answer to, 'who am I, beyond sports?' They're developing more hobbies, interests and outlets to let out tension. This is going to make them have more ways to blow off steam, and let go of the tension that they're going to find. So, athletes are likely to come out of this better off."


  Dr. Spencer has some advice as well to those athletes impacted.


  "One of the biggest things I've suggested to athletes is this - they have got to get their sleep consistent. Sleep is the number one factor in performance," he said. "The more we can hold our sleep to consistent, the better off we're going to feel. The biggest problem for that is, especially high school athletes, are in their rooms, with their cellphones. This is their social time. This is when they're able to connect via Snap and Insta with their friends, and I get that. But at the same time, there's got to be a cap to that.


  "It's not wise for them to be up at 2:00 in the morning on their phones, sleeping all morning, having an irregular sleep pattern. They have got to draw the line somewhere, get to be at a reasonable, earlier time and then feel good enough in the morning to get a good workout, get a good jump on the day. If they can maintain the structure, their mental health is far more likely to be better off."


   _As the sports world has stopped during the coronavirus pandemic, athletes at all levels are dealing with a new way of life, without the ability to play the sport they enjoy. WFMZ Sports Director Dan Moscaritolo spoke one-one-one with Dr. Jarrod Spencer, a sports psychologist and the founder of the Mind Of The Athlete, LLC, in a wide-ranging interview about how athletes can get through these uncertain times. This multi-part series will continue through the week._

Despite the interesting cover art, I would recommend that readers steer clear of this book. It doesn't hold up to the artist's imagery; although the artist's cover art is interesting enough to be used as a writing prompt for a Sci-Fantasy roleplaying game scenario. Readers would do well to not compare this work to Poul Anderson's later and far better-written novels. We can surely chalk this one up to his youth and inexperience. Thankfully his writings greatly improved over time. I would leave this book to the collectors and completists to own. Let my mistake be my own and your saving grace.

We are going to see permanent virtual shifts on a number of platforms. There are already remote exercise platforms like Peloton or the MIRROR [Home Gym]. Those are only going to be three- and four-fold going forward. There will be permanent changes. While gyms will exist, they will probably exist in a different way, with more spacing, less headcount. From a human standpoint, it’s flat-out interesting. From a business standpoint, it will allow us to attract a broad array of talent from different locations. Companies including my own will, at the end of the day, be spending a lot less on travel two years from now than they did two years ago. We will adjust and become much more effective and efficient.

The notorious, armor-clad, 19th century Australian bushranger (slang for rural outlaw) Ned Kelly had previously been portrayed onscreen by Mick Jagger ("Ned Kelly," 1970) and by Heath Ledger ("Ned Kelly," 2003). Neither of those films was particularly memorable. Now, here comes British rising star George MacKay, the long-faced lead actor in "1917," to sparklingly bring the character to life in what turns out to be the best, by far, of the three attempts to tell the story.


  But let's start with an important point: The beautiful and occasionally brutal film, from Australian director Justin Kurzel, bearing the much longer title "True History of the Kelly Gang," is not a "true history." Based on the Booker Prize-winning 2000 novel by Peter Carey, it, like the book, is a dramatic mix of fact and fiction that tells a fanciful version of the short life of Kelly from the age of 12 (terrifically played by Australian newcomer Orlando Schwerdt) to his final date with destiny 13 years later.

  I won't attempt to speculate what's true here and what isn't, because since the film is making no claims to it, it doesn't make any difference. Besides, what's up on the screen is both riveting and entertaining.


  Young Ned is first met growing up in a tin shack in a rural town north of Melbourne, the oldest of his siblings, with his mum, Ellen (Essie Davis), and dad, Red, all of them just eking by. Red (Ben Corbett) was a no-count loser who didn't provide for his family. Ellen, much to Red's consternation, earned money by selling her body to various male visitors, including the strapping but dastardly Sgt. O'Neil (Charlie Hunnam).


  After Red is removed from the story, Ellen, hoping to give Ned something of a future, works out a deal with an old friend, the smiling, rough and tumble scoundrel Harry Power (Russell Crowe in an extended, scene-stealing cameo), who takes the lad out on the road to teach him the ways of the world, which include keeping a journal "to write your own history" and how to kill people.


  Every performance in the film's first 40 minutes is right on the mark (Crowe even gets to sing!). But it's at that point, 10 years later in the story, that MacKay appears, bent backward, his head disconcertingly upside down, his adult Ned Kelly preparing for a bare-knuckle barroom fight, just before heading back home to his mum and grown siblings with hopes of becoming a farmer.


  But that hope doesn't materialize, and we know that part is true, that Ned will end up embracing a life of crime, due to a variety of reasons, people and circumstances. It's then that the film starts introducing many more characters. Of note are George King (the amazing Marlon Williams), the much- younger man - and cad - who is about to marry Ned's unbalanced mum, and who is training Ned's brothers to become thieves; the charming but heinous Constable Fitzpatrick (Nicholas Hoult), whose behavior eventually goes unhinged; and Mary Hearn (Thomasin McKenzie), a sweet young woman working at a local brothel.


  It would be simplest to say that this is an Australian art house Western, but it's chockful of cinematic and storytelling ingredients that pull it up above that category. It's about bad things happening to good people, and the revenge being sought because it of; it gets into people who are so driven by their goals, they start losing their marbles; and it offers explanations of why the bushrangers who became known as the Kelly Gang started donning dresses and armor before going into action.


  One outstanding visual highlight of the film occurs near the end, when the law is closing in on the gang, and the screen erupts in an eerie and bizarrely and beautifully photographed nighttime gunfight. But even that long sequence can't hold a candle to the bigger-than-life, make that gigantic, performance by George MacKay. He's been at his craft for quite a while, and he's now, finally, a star in the making.


  "True History of the Kelly Gang" will be available on most digital and cable platforms beginning April 24.

  "To add insult to injury, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has blamed frontline staff for the shortages in PPE by implying they were using too much of it, but hospitals have been discharging patients to care homes for weeks without even testing them for COVID-19.”
