Yesterday, Mr Preston said the parks were closed due to problems with people “congregating, arranging to meet friends and turning up and playing football”.
 “This is normally great but we’re in the middle of a crisis which is costing lives and jobs,” he added.
 The independent mayor also pointed to a think-tank report which showed Middlesbrough was deemed to be one of the most vulnerable places to covid-19 in the UK.
 Middlesbrough had 394 recorded cases of coronavirus on Monday \- seeing it ranked 95th in the country out of all local authorities (April 20).
 However, this list includes county councils and areas with much higher populations.
 In a letter, Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald told Mr Preston he believed he’d made the wrong call - and urged him to heed the government’s advice.
 Middlesbrough Council’s Labour group has also drawn up an alternative “five point plan” to reopen parks which includes limiting access to pedestrians, warden patrols and weekly reviews of the policy.
 Mr Preston says he will reopen parks as soon as he believed it was safe - and also referred to the significant number of wardens and staff it would take to ensure parks were policed properly.

 In 2017, to celebrate the film's 30th anniversary, Elwes spoke with _PopSugar_ about his time on the film, and how he came to be involved. "I was shooting a film in Berlin at the time that Rob [Reiner, director] was starting to put the production together," Elwes told the outlet. "He flew out to Berlin to meet me, so I read for him, and I told him in the room that I'd read the book. William Goldman loomed very large in my home. Both my father and my stepfather were big fans of his, so he was quite the household name. It made me that much more excited to get the role."
 He went on to address the sad reality that the film was not originally considered a hit. "I think we were all disappointed that it didn't quite get the traction we wanted, since we put a lot of hard work into it and thought it was a lovely movie," Cary Elwes, who starred as the dreamy Westley, revealed on a recent phone call with me in light of the film's anniversary this year. "Luckily for us, the invention of the VCR breathed new life into our movie. _The Princess Bride_ had been dead for 10 years, so we were so grateful for that invention, because that's when the movie found its audience. Kind of like when Wizard of Oz found its audience on TV." Additionally, Elwes previously write a book of behind-the-scenes stories from the film, titled, _As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales From the Making of The Princess Bride_.

The current coronavirus pandemic has created a lot of drama around people attending churches on Sundays despite stay-at-home orders in several states and national guidelines on social distancing. Despite a virtual ban on gatherings of ten or more people, some churches and pastors around the nation have ignored them and held regular services.
 One is Pastor Tony Spell in Louisiana who made headlines back at the start of April by violating public orders in the state to hold church services. Police charged Spell with violating an executive order by the governor and Central Police Chief Roger Corcoran lashed out at the time, saying Spell was out to "embarrass" police for "self-promotion."
 Weeks later, Spell has taken another bold step by asking them and other Americans to donate their stimulus checks to "evangelists, missionaries and music ministers" who haven't received offerings due to the shutdown. According to _CNN_, Spell claims he and his wife have donated their checks already and their son is doing the same.
 Speaking with CNN anchor Victor Blackwell on Palm Sunday, Spell defended his decision by saying many he's saying to donate to don't receive checks of their own.
 "We are challenging you, if you can, give your stimulus package to evangelists and missionaries, who do not get the stimulus package," he told CNN. Spell also contended that the pandemic is "politically motivated" and the stay-at- home guidelines are "government overreach."
 As CNN notes, Louisiana has the 9th-most confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S., with 1,267 deaths and 23,000 confirmed infections. Chief Corcoran claimed he isn't finished with Spell yet and believes his motivations fly in the face of "the strength and resilience" in the community.
 "Mr. Spell will have his day in court where he will be held responsible for his reckless and irresponsible decisions that endangered the health of his congregation and our community," he said in a statement.
 Spell is not the only religious leader to speak out against the pandemic guidelines or hold services despite state orders. Jerry Falwell Jr. came under heavy criticism for his decision to reopen Liberty University after spring break despite Virginia's guidelines, while another pastor in Florida was arrested for holding services in defiance of the state's executive orders.
 Rodney Howard-Browne not only defied orders to hold services, but he also had his members shake hands and show that the virus was not going to affect them. Sheriff Chad Chronister felt differently when issuing the arrest warrant.

 "His reckless disregard for human life put hundreds of people in his congregation at risk and thousands of residents who may interact with them this week in danger," Chronister said during a press conference at the time. "They have access to technology allowing them to live stream their services over the internet and broadcast to their 400 members from the safety of their own homes, but instead they chose to gather at church."
 Spell has not been arrested and held Easter services after receiving his summons, with 1,220 in attendance.

Asian Games gold medallist in double trap, Ronjan Sodhi, may have decided to walk away from competitive shooting some time back, but the marksman who comes only second to 2004 Athens Olympic Games silver medallist RVS Rathore in terms of achievements, has been a guiding force for youngsters willing to learn the art of which he was the undisputed master.While double trap may have been given the short shrift by the Olympic Movement -- it was taken off the Games programme prior to the now-postponed 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, though it continues to remain in the ISSF World Championships, the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games -- Sodhi, 40, is still keen to pass on the knowledge to whoever is willing to learn.The champion shooter, winner of two World Cup gold and two silver medals at the Commonwealth Games, has a piece of advice for young shooter --find innovative ways to train and make the most of the enforced lockdown to improve your skills."I feel, necessity gives rise to innovation and shooters should not just be sitting idle, waiting for the lockdown to end; they'll find the world has gone way ahead by the time they return to competitive shooting again. "When the coronavirus thing started, it necessitated that we wear a mask 24X7. I felt very uneasy at first but I got used to it and now wear it 24 x 7. Now it's become a part of my routine, a necessity."With masks, gloves and frequent hand sanitization becoming the new norm, Sodhi feels it'll only help shooters if they acquire the habit now rather than when they are back in competition. "Just the same way they do visualisation, or may be dry training, they can incorporate this habit as well, so there is no discomfort when they are back in competition," says Sodhi."During my competitive days, I innovated a lot. Now that I'm retired I can share the knowledge but when I was competing, no one came to know about my training regimen. Everyone would have seen the laser keychain which emits a pointed green or red beam. In the confines of my room, I used to tell somebody to point the laser beam on the wall and move it at the same speed at which the clay pigeon exited the machine on the shooting range."I was basically simulating the flight of the clay pigeon on the wall of my training room. Somebody would be sitting on the table and pointing the beams at angles of 35 and 45 degrees and a height of three metres. I would ask a person to move the laser at a certain speed which was actually the speed of the target in competition. The person would loop the laser and then I would follow the laser and mutter fire," says Sodhi, adding that it was the secret of my success. "A lot of people don't do this; may be they don't know about it."In fact, the Delhi-based marksman says, shooters should stick to their routine as if they were at the shooting range so that they are not caught by surprise once they are back in competition. "They should earmark a spot at their homes…kind of an imaginary firing station, walk up to the station and stand at the same spot every day. They should close their eyes, visualise that you are walking on to the station. Even the time is of essence… you have to time yourself (imagine) in such a way that there are six shooters at the range, and you have a total time of 135 seconds to complete a cycle. Every shooter gets 25 seconds to fire, so you calculate when you have to pick up the gun and keep counting… fifth shooter shooting… fourth shooter shooting… now it's your turn. In my case, somebody would be ready with the laser (in fact two, as I am a double trap shooter)."Sodhi, who learnt many of his skill form the legendary Russell Mark, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics gold medallist, says the Australian once told him, "It's not about the quantity of ammunition you burn at the ranges but the quality of training.""He said, if you go once a week to the range and shoot 100 cartridges that's more than enough rather than going every day and firing 500 cartridges.""The lockdown will show who scores more on return."

Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has made a move that allows teams to lay off or cut the pay of major and minor league managers, coaches, trainers and full- time scouts starting May 1. Manfred has suspended uniform employee contracts that cover about 9,000 people, including general managers on some teams. Manfred cited the inability to play games due to the national emergency caused by the new coronavirus pandemic.
 "Our clubs rely heavily on revenue from tickets/concessions, broadcasting/media, licensing and sponsorships to pay salaries," Manfred wrote in an email Monday, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. "In the absence of games, these revenue streams will be lost or substantially reduced, and clubs will not have sufficient funds to meet their financial obligations." "The impact of the suspension of the UEC on your personal employment situation will be determined by your club," Manfred said. Manfred's intention to suspend the contracts was first reported by The Athletic.
 Arizona, Atlanta, Boston, the Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati, Minnesota, the New York Yankees, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco and Toronto are among the teams that have committed to paying full-time employees through May, and Miami will pay full-time baseball operations staff through the month. The Cubs will pay those on UECs and front-office staff through their May 29 paychecks. Major League Rule 3(i) requires that UECs must be signed by all managers, coaches, trainers and salaried scouts, and some teams include additional baseball operations staff.
 "Pursuant to the terms of the UEC, the club's exclusive right to your services will remain in effect during the period of the suspension such that you will not be permitted to perform services for any other club," Manfred wrote. "I fully recognize the hardship that this health crisis creates for all members of the baseball community. Central baseball and the clubs are doing everything possible to try to minimize this impact for as many employees as possible." Manfred said the Baseball Assistance Team charitable organization "is available to consider grant applications on an expedited basis for those facing significant and immediate financial hardship."

Tiki Barber was critical of Eli Manning during his time with the New York Giants. However, once Manning announced his retirement from the NFL earlier this year, Barber, who was teammates with Manning from 2004-2006, believes he will be going to Canton, Ohio in the foreseeable future. Barber spoke to PopCulture.com about Manning's career, and he believes the Pro Football Hall of Fame will happen for the retired quarterback.
 "He certainly will," Barber said the PopCulture.com exclusively. "He has a legacy that unique. Two championships, two Super Bowl MVPs, the top 10 in passing yards and passing touchdowns. Statistically, he's a Hall of Famer. There's a lot of negativity that floats around him. But it discounts the fact that football is a team game. While he lifted some of those bad seasons to successful ones, even the '07 championship year, nobody thought that they were going to a Super Bowl, and surely they weren't going to beat the unbeatable New England Patriots.
 Barber continued: "Yet he created these iconic moments that make him a legend especially in New York and appreciated around the league. He may not be a first-ballot Hall of Famer because of the peers that will be going in around him, but he's certainly a Hall of Famer."

 Barber might be right about Manning not making the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Some voters may not look at Manning as a legendary player despite his stats. However, the Ole Miss alum could get in simply based on there won't be too many players who will be entering their first year of eligibility in 2025. Other than Manning, Vernon Davis, Darren Sproles, Lorenzo Alexander and Luke Kuechly will be on the ballot for the first time five years from now, according to Clark Judge of the Talk of Fame Network.
 Barber spent his entire career with the Giants, as he was drafted by the team in the second round in 2007. When Manning entered the league in 2004, Barber's career took off. In 2004, Barber was named to his first Pro Bowl after rushing for 1,518 yards and 13 touchdowns. He was named to the All-Pro First Team in 2005 after registering a career-high 1,860 yards and nine touchdowns, which led to the Giants winning the NFC East. In Barber's final season, he tallied 1,662 yards and five touchdowns.

Rim Country businesses continue to do what they can to stay afloat amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 With restaurant dining rooms closed with the first official case diagnosis in Gila County weeks ago, many remain open for pickup service.
 Common Grounds, at 219 S. Colcord Road in Payson, is one of them.
 The coffee shop has cut its hours of operation, but is still open 6:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday through Friday and 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
 “Once the lobby gets reopened, we’ll go back to our normal hours,” said manager Ashley Morris.
 When that will be, is anyone’s guess.
 They feature a pickup window and several outside tables on a shady, dog- friendly patio area featuring free Wi-Fi service.
 “We just tell customers to use the patio at their own discretion and practice what’s been recommended,” Morris said.
 The business is located a block west of State Route 87, just north of Expedition Church.
 Morris is thankful they haven’t had to lay off any of their four employees.
 “We went from two shifts a day to one, so everybody’s taken a hit, but at least we’re still employed,” she said.
 And she thanked the community for that.
 “Business has slowed down but we have had tremendous support,” Morris said. “We have people going the extra step to support us, which has been really awesome. They’re taking the extra effort to stop and walk up to the window instead of going the more convenient route of going to a drive-thru. So, that’s enabled us to stay open. And we’ve gotten new regulars, too, that have joined the shop local movement. Without (our regular customers) we would have had to close down. We appreciate that support so that we are able to still have a job.”
 They serve both hot and iced coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, a variety of hot and iced teas, lemonade and a variety of flavors including lavender, honey, caramel, mocha, white mocha, vanilla and coconut. They also serve baked goods.
 Great coffee is a key to Common Ground’s success. And keeping everything local is another.
 “We outsource as much locally as possible,” Morris said. “So, I am also the baker for them. We don’t buy from anywhere else. I’ve baked for them for a little over a year now.
 “And Tom Plets is our coffee roaster. He is also from Payson. We use honey from Boyd’s Farm in Gisela. We use lavender from Pine Creek Lavender Farm.”
 Morris said centering the business on the customers is another key to their success.
 “We value getting to know our customers and giving them a sense of normalcy and a sense of home,” she said. “We are really big on connecting and developing those relationships and we want them to know they still have a place to go.”
 Common Grounds raises money for local nonprofits through a tip jar for that project. They’ve had to put that on hold until they can reopen the lobby.
 “Every month we highlight a different nonprofit and people are able to donate to that,” Morris said. “We want the community to be a part of us and we want to be a part of the community.”

Amid the coronavirus outbreak, social distancing has become the best practice in fighting the spread. As a result, many non-essential stores across the country have locked their doors and switched over to an online-only outlet for the time being. For essential stores like grocery chains, business has been anything but normal as limitations have been placed on capacity and masks and protective gear are being worn by workers and shoppers, alike.
 While online delivery and pick-up options have grown, the physical shopping aspect has remained a constant, which means customers are putting not just themselves at risk, but the employees. According to a report on CNN _,_ Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers' union, believes supermarkets need to act now and move to online only because "careless customers" have become "probably the biggest threat" to employees.
 Perrone isn't the only one sharing that line of thinking. John Logan, professor and director of Labor and Employment Studies at San Francisco State University, knows it is important to eliminate human interaction where possible. "Anything that reduces the need for interaction with the public and allows for greater physical distancing will ultimately better protect grocery workers," said Logan. "Shuttering stores and repurposing them for pickup and delivery only would be a positive step."
 Places like Walmart have been swarmed with people inside, despite extending their online delivery and pickup times. Meanwhile, some local grocers have found it easier to close up shop and move to a safer shopping experience for its customers.

 Mike Houston, who runs a market in Takoma Park, Maryland, told CNN he shut his place down in the early going to keep his employees safe. "I'm unwilling to put grocery store employees, essential though we are, in a position to risk what can be a fatal infection," he said. The same general manager also tossed shade at companies still putting their people at risk, "Any store still allowing hundreds of members of the public to enter every day is taking a calculated risk on behalf of their front line staff. That is highly irresponsible to me."
 Supermarket giant, Kroger, who has offered its employees benefits and bonuses for being on the front line, has kept its doors open during the pandemic and experienced its first employee to contract COVID-19 over the weekend. Earlier in April, the company announced it would begin to limit the amount of customers that enter the store to help slow the spread.

Lorraine traveled on the Titanic with her parents, Hudson, a Canadian entrepreneur, and Bess, as well as her seven-month-old brother Trevor and an entourage of servants. The report says that when the ship struck the iceberg, Trevor was taken to a lifeboat by a maid, Alice Cleaver. Hudson, Bess, and Loraine remained on board and apparently turned down many opportunities to be saved, possibly because they were searching for their son. Hudson’s body was the only one to be found.
