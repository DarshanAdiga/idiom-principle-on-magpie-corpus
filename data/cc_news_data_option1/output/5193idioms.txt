STOPPING MURRAY
 Quarterbacks have run for 364 yards against the Eagles this season. Lamar Jackson had 108 in Baltimore’s win in Philadelphia in October. Daniel Jones had 156 in two games for the Giants. Now Murray presents another difficult challenge: He has 712 yards rushing and 10 TDs on the ground in 13 games.
 “We’ve faced a lot of guys that had similar skill sets, but all of them were unique,” Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz said. “All of them had a different way that they ran the ball. All of them had a different skill set passing. Whether they were throwing quick passes, whether they were scrambling to buy time to make big plays down the field.
 “Every player stands on his own in the NFL, and what we’re going to try to do against Kyler Murray will be specific for his skill set and their offense. It won’t be based on what we did against Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson or any of the other guys that we’ve faced that are dual-threat quarterbacks.”
