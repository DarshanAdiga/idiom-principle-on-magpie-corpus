Libya has restarted production at its largest field, Sharara, as peace talks began between eastern and western forces. The national Oil Corporation announced it had lifted the force majeure on Sharara after reaching an agreement with the Petroleum Facilities Guard to "end the entire obstacles that face Al Sharara Field in a way that guarantees there will be no security breaches and in a way that enables the National Oil Corporation to lift the force majeure status and resume production in Al Sharara Oil Field." Libya is currently producing about 300,000 bpd and Sharara could add up to 200,000 bpd more after the lifting of an oil port blockade by the eastern- affiliated Libyan National Army. From below 100,000 bpd, oil output reached close to 300,000 bpd in a matter of two weeks. And plans are to continue ramping up the governor of Libya's central bank has called on the industry to raise oil production to 1.7 million bpd, which would be more than the country produced before the oil port blockade - 1.2 million bpd. The National Oil Corporation, which has been saying for months the blockade is costing Libya billions in lost oil revenues, earlier this month reported it had booked in July the smallest monthly revenue this year. At $38.2 million, the July figure was down from $2.1 billion a year earlier. In August, the NOC said, revenues improved thanks to a temporary lifting of the force majeure it had imposed on exports for the duration of the blockade, to $90 billion. This was down from $2 billion for August 2019. Libya's production ramp-up plan fly straight in the face of OPEC's plan to continue keeping a lid on production amid still sluggish demand improvement and persistently low oil prices. In fact, following Libya's production increase, reports have emerged that Saudi Arabia was mulling over cancelling a planned relaxation of the cuts by about 2 million bpd from January next year. The relaxation is part of the April agreement between OPEC members but that agreement probably factored in higher prices as a result of the deep cuts so far this year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com

 A former Taylorville man living in southwestern Tennessee was killed last week and two suspects were arrested and charged in the incident.
 Brian Diss, 39, was found dead with evidence of foul play in his home just outside of Savannah, Tennessee, Thursday afternoon following a 911 call, according to a press release from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.
 TBI agents and Hardin (Tenn.) County sheriff's deputies quickly developed information that identified Jeremy Byram, 26, and Jeanna Chacon, 27, as suspects. The couple was apprehended in separate vehicles by Illinois State Police Friday afternoon and later booked into the Saline County Jail in Harrisburg.
 Byram was charged with first-degree murder and evidence tampering and Jeanna Chacon was charged with being an accessory after the fact.
 The couple is being held without bond while awaiting extradition back to Hardin County. It wasn't immediately clear if the two were going to fight extradition.
 The TBI news release listed the couple as being from Abilene, Texas, but the Savannah Courier newspaper reported the couple as living in the hamlet of Swift, just down the road from Diss' home.
 The newspaper reported the Hardin County sheriff as saying a witness told a sheriff's deputy that Diss and Byram had been involved in a fight earlier. It also reported the sheriff as saying Diss had a shotgun wound to his abdomen.

The New York Rangers and Alexis Lafreniere wasted no time coming to terms on their first contract agreement. On Monday, the team announced that they have signed the No. 1 draft pick to a three-year, entry-level contract. The deal is for $925,000 annually, which is the maximum salary that rookies can accrue under the current collective bargaining agreement.
 In addition, the team also announced that Lafreniere -- the Rangers' first No. 1 overall pick in the entry draft era -- will wear No. 13 for the Rangers.
 Lafreniere was rated as the top prospect in the 2020 NHL Draft by just about all major scouting analysts. He has spent the last three seasons starring for Rimouski Océanic in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The 19-year-old star was the No. 1 pick in the 2017 QMJHL Draft and burst onto the scene with 42 goals in 60 games.
 To put that into perspective, Lafreniere had the highest number of goals in a rookie season since Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby scored 54 for Rimouski Oceanic in 2004. In his three seasons in the QMJHL, Lafreniere accumulated 297 points (114 goals and 183 assists) and blossomed into one of the most dangerous young players in the world.
