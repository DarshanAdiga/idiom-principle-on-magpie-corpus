In the coming weeks, we will see some relatively small portion of Americans with great big megaphones and well-financed backers start to openly attack the selfsame health care workers who were celebrated as heroes just a few weeks ago. We will see attacks on people wearing masks and attacks on people lawfully asking others to wear masks. Some leaders will buckle under the pressure to rescind orders with claims that in choosing between liberty and death, they went with liberty. Others, like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, will respond by insisting that the brandishing of guns inside the state Capitol is not, in fact, “liberty,” and that if it is liberty and justice, it is hardly liberty and justice for all, but rather for a small minority of people who seek to define freedom as something they will seize and threaten and even kill for. A good rule of thumb for COVID-based discussions about “opening up” is that if someone is demanding it while threatening to hurt or kill you, you are probably not as “free” as they are, and that their project does nothing to increase freedom in America and everything to hoard a twisted idea of freedom for themselves.

Milina, who is studying at Stockton Riverside College, said: "My mum has worked in the hospital for around 10 years now.
 "When I was young she would bring me into work and I would see the bags of blood. She never made me feel like it was a scary environment - it was just another place.
 "Quite a lot of my family have been surprised, a lot of them said 'you're definitely your mother's daughter'. They are very proud of me which is really nice.
 "We are handling Covid patients and even if they're not (positive), we have to treat them as if they are just for our safety. We are doing as much as we can to protect ourselves.
 "It's scary because you see it in the news, you see these horrible headlines but at the end of the day it's got to be done. There's no avoiding it. It's a job that needs to be done.
 "You could just shield yourself in but I I don't want to do that!
 "I have said from the beginning I wanted to help, whether that's in a supermarket, as a delivery driver or working in the mortuary - it's something that benefits other people."

Milina said that she has become frustrated with people who continue to flout social distancing rules.
 She said: "I can't stress enough how important it is to just stay home and not visit people.
 "People are just treating it as a joke as if 'it won't affect me'
 "People just can't listen to what, at the end of the day, are simple rules.
 "You can be driving to work and there will be a group of people all standing together and I’m thinking, 'What don’t you understand about this?' But some people don’t see beyond the numbers on the news.
 "It’s very different when you see the real people and you think this is a person with a family and lots of people are going to be affected by their loss."

At the World’s Fair in Chicago is where she performed her now-famous burlesque dance with ostrich feathers and fans, an event that helped her cultivate a fan base all along Route 66. Lucille HamonsLike Lucille Hammons, you’re a kind-hearted and generous person. Hamons was known as “Mother of the Mother Road.” She and her husband ran Lucille’s Service Station working nearly around the clock to offer service and hospitality to Route 66 travelers. When motorists had no money for gas, much less a roof over their head, Lucille provided them with food and shelter for whatever they could offer to pay.Fran HouserLike Fran Houser, you’re a warm and friendly person. Fran Houser owned the Midpoint Café, welcoming travelers to the halfway point and inspired the character of Flo of Flo’s V-8 Café in the Pixar movie Cars. As owner of Adrian’s MidPoint Café from 1990 to 2012, Fran congratulated Route 66 road-trippers for reaching the halfway point of the Mother Road. How? With a warm Texas greeting and a tasty offering of home- baked pies at her Adrian restaurant. Mary Colter Like Mary Colter, you’re a creative and a hard-working person. Colter is famed architect who designed many places along Route 66, including La Posada Hotel in Winslow, Arizona; La Fonda in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Grand Canyon’s Phantom Ranch, and was one of few women in the profession at the time.Lucia Rodriguez Like Lucia Rodriguez, you’re a generous and caring person. Rodriguez opened Mitla Café in San Bernardino, California to support the town’s Mexican American residents. San Bernardino was a segregated city; in order to foster a sense of community among Mexican American residents, Mitla Café hosted local events and fiestas. All of these grassroots efforts paved the way for the establishment of the Mexican American Defense Committee, an organization that helped desegregate California schools.What’s your favorite state along Route 66?Which of these words best describes you?Which Route 66 landmark is on your bucket list?What kind of classic car would you like to own?Which of these sound like a dream job to you?

Yes, unfortunately. Even those stunning figures won't fully capture the magnitude of the damage the coronavirus has inflicted on the job market. Many people who are still employed have had their hours reduced. Others have suffered pay cuts. Some who lost jobs in April and didn't look for a new one in light of their bleak prospects won't even be counted as unemployed. A broader measure -- the proportion of adults with jobs -- could hit a record low.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- As the coronavirus pandemic decimates many companies, big business that has become synonymous with the world's largest prison system continues to make money. Men and women behind bars in at least 40 states continue to work, sometimes earning next to nothing to make masks and hand sanitizer to help guard others from the pandemic. They have been cut off from family visits for weeks but get charged as much as $25 for a 15-minute phone call. They also pay marked-up prices at the commissary for soap so they can wash their hands more frequently. That service can carry a 100% processing fee.

In the Company's Agency strategy, a precipitous decline in interest rates and high levels of interest rate volatility generated net realized and unrealized losses on the Company's interest rate hedges of $(38.8) million. Partially offsetting these losses was net interest income5 of $3.9 million, and net realized and unrealized gains on the long investment portfolio of $18.7 million, also driven by the decline in interest rates. With heightened interest rate volatility and a flight to the safe haven of U.S. Treasury securities, yield spreads widened on Agency pools across the board.

The lawyer for the wife of Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas said she is being subjected to an “unfounded ongoing investigation” by Texas police after she allegedly pointed a loaded gun at her husband’s head upon finding him in bed with another woman last month.
 According to a police affidavit, Nina Thomas tracked down her husband at a short-term rental home in Austin in the early morning hours of April 13 and found him and his brother, Seth, in bed with two women.
 The affidavit says Nina Thomas admitted to pointing the pistol at Earl Thomas’ head “with the intent to scare him.” She had taken the magazine out of the gun and disengaged the safety, but police noted “she was unaware the gun had a round in the chamber.”
 Nina Thomas struck Earl Thomas repeatedly with her free hand before her husband eventually wrestled the 9 mm Beretta from her grasp, the affidavit said. At that point, he told the woman with whom he was romantically linked to call the police.
 Nina Thomas was arrested on a felony charge of burglary of a habitation with the intent to commit aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The incident was first reported by TMZ.
 After getting word that the episode would soon be made public, Earl Thomas acknowledged late Wednesday in a video on his Instagram account that there was “an altercation between me and Nina.”

Memorial Day weekend! We’re in the thick of things now. And who better to honor the fallen heroes of our military than… unkillable NYPD officer John McClane. Okay, so “Die Hard with a Vengeance” (5/19/1995) may not seem like the most patriotic example of popcorn entertainment, but there’s an intrinsic American quality about watching Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson try to overcome casual racism, solve a third-grade logic problem before it kills them, and murder the sexy foreigners who dare to threaten our economy (and, less importantly, our children). John McTiernan’s sweltering blockbuster sequel is character-driven mid-‘90s action cinema at its finest, complete with memorable characters, killer set pieces, and an unforgettable reminder that Chester A. Arthur was the 21st President of the United States.

"Over the past few years, we have issued investment-grade-rated senior unsecured notes and have completed several securitizations, all of which provide locked-in, term, non-mark-to-market financing. Several of our secured financing facilities are committed and non-mark-to-market, and have repayment schedules that more closely match the repayment schedules of the financed assets. Also, our objective has always been to stagger the roll dates of our repo financings, and to roll these financings in advance of maturity dates as a standard practice. Our disciplined interest rate hedging and opportunistic credit hedging has also provided additional book value protection. All these measures, combined with strong liquidity management practices, helped us to avoid the forced selling at distressed prices suffered by so many credit market participants during the quarter. While an economic return of negative 16% for a quarter is painful to say the least, I am extremely proud of how our team managed through the extreme challenges of the quarter.

Scorn, one of the most hauntingly mesmerizing games in recent memory, will skip current-gen consoles. It's only coming to PC and Xbox Series X.I'm beyond hyped for Scorn, Ebb Software's ultra-bizarre horror fest. It's like stepping into an HR Giger painting. Scorn was originally funded via Kickstarter in 2017 and has been knee-deep in misty weirdness since. This is our first update in a long, long time. And it's a big one.Ebb confirms Scorn will be a next-gen Xbox Series X exclusive, and it's not coming to PS4 or Xbox One systems. The studio simply doesn't feel current-gen is worth it. And yes, the game is still coming. The developers just don't know when.'No. We really don't want to spend development time on what would from a technical standpoint (900p resolution, frame rates dipping below 30fps) be a sub-par version of the game and overall not a good experience,' the studio said in a recent Steam post.Ebb also says they partnered with Microsoft because of the huge autonomy the Xbox giant offered. The devs didn't have to give up creative freedom on the game, just exclusivity rights, which is par for the course for any publishing deal.The team is also impressed by the Xbox Series X and is targeting 4K 60FPS with Scorn, with an emphasis on solid 60FPS gameplay.So why the long silence? Kickstarter backers started thinking Scorn was vaporware. The game was delayed and consolidated into a single release in 2018, and there hasn't been many updates since. Turns out that making games is hard and expensive, and Ebb Software simply struggled for resources. That changed when they partnered with investment Kowloon Nights. Things are better for Ebb and they're making progress on Scorn.There's currently no planned release date for Scorn, but it's coming to PC and Xbox Series X and won't be available on PlayStation 5.'The biggest issue, in our eyes, that is creating all the commotion is a consequence of one necessary evil. Up until 20 months ago, when we signed with Kowloon Nights investment fund, we were constantly struggling with resources. We were barely scraping by, never having time to try out different things, having to half-ass so many tasks just so we could finish anything at all.'Don't get us wrong we are not moaning about our fate, it's the same for every new indie studio and we were dealing with it in the best way we knew how. What is important, and what we would like you to fully understand is that the only reason we went to Kickstarter, or even made those trailers in 2016 and 2017, was to give ourselves a chance to receive additional funding and survive.'We haven't done it to vainly show off the work that we have done up to that point, build a community for the community's sake, or make some additional money because it was up there for grabs. We did it as our last chance to finish at least the first part of the game. Splitting the game into 2 parts was a big compromise at that time, thankfully that compromise has been successfully rectified.'
