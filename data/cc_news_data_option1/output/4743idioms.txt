SACRAMENTO – In light of an unprecedented, rapid rise in COVID-19 cases across California, Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) today announced a limited Stay at Home Order requiring generally that non-essential work, movement and gatherings stop between 10 PM and 5 AM in counties in the purple tier. The order will take effect at 10 PM Saturday, November 21 and remain in effect until 5 AM December 21. This is the same as the March Stay at Home Order, but applied only between 10 PM and 5 AM and only in purple tier counties that are seeing the highest rates of positive cases and hospitalizations.

Black Lives Matter came up with the single most effective political slogan of the year. While no one was likely to be overly impressed with Joe Biden’s line, “Build Back Better,” and Donald Trump’s “Keep America Great” or “Make America Great Again, Again” didn’t have the resonance of the original 2016 version, BLM broke through the clutter with a catchphrase that was memorable, pungent — and utterly devastating to Democrats.
 After a surprising Tory victory in the British parliamentary election in 1992, the pro-Tory tabloid The Sun famously boasted, “It’s the Sun Wot Won It.” In the same spirit, it could be said that in this year’s congressional election, “It’s ‘Defund the Police’ Wot Lost It.”
 Democrats have an uphill battle to take the U.S. Senate — pending two Georgia run-offs — and suffered shocking setbacks in the House that drastically diminished their majority. All over the map, Democrats got hammered on defunding the police, which couldn’t have been better designed to extract maximum political pain with zero upside.
 Black Lives Matter has been a stunning success in the elite culture. It won the obeisance of almost every major institution, from corporate America to sports leagues to colleges. It created a powerful, if dishonest, narrative of systemic police racism. It got invested with nearly a holy significance, such that criticizing it is considered at least a sin and perhaps a firing offense. Much more importantly, at least for a time after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, it won the goodwill of a clear majority of Americans.
 To take this position of strength and use it primarily to associate your allies with a politically radioactive position requires extraordinary strategic folly and heedless ideological fanaticism. BLM had both, in ample supply. The notion of defunding the police had been rattling around the left for a long time, but the George Floyd protests took it mainstream.
 BLM pushed municipalities to actually act on the proposal. Whenever someone tried to take the edge off defunding the police by redefining it as simply reallocating some law-enforcement dollars, defenders piped up to say, No, we really mean it. The New York Times ran an op-ed against incrementalist interpretations, “Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police.” Predictably, Republicans took the weapon handed to them and used it, as Democrats would have done if a voluble faction on the right called for, say, abolishing child welfare agencies.
 The effectiveness of the attack now has Democrats who are otherwise loath to speak ill of BLM complaining about what its catchy slogan did to the party. After support for BLM surged last spring, positive feelings for it have been declining.
 A Pew Research report showed support for BLM dropping from 67% in June to 55% in September. Only 45% of white people expressed support for the movement. Given that BLM elevated the dumbest, most self-destructive slogan in American politics in a very long time, and an even more atrocious policy, its numbers deserve to fall further. Advocates of defunding the police argued that setting out an extreme position could have a political effect even if it had no chance of enactment. They proved exactly right — just not how they expected.

Since moving locations to Thackerville, court documents illustrate how the Lowes have been showcasing their animals at the new facility using the platform Cameo. Lauren Lowe has been seen with lions and tigers on the paid subscription site "OnlyFans," the DOJ said.
 Lowe claimed in March 2018 to have "learned a lot about distracting, diverting attention, & using smoke and mirrors in the last few years," and has also said, "If we lose a lawsuit, we simply change the name and open another animal business someplace else, we all have multiple USDA licenses available," according to the complaint.  
 "The Lowes' failure to provide basic veterinary care, appropriate food, and safe living conditions for the animals does not meet standards required by both the Animal Welfare Act and the Endangered Species Act," Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jonathan D. Brightbill of the Environment and Natural Resources Division at the Justice Department said in a statement. "Exhibitors cannot evade the law simply by shutting out the USDA and moving their animals elsewhere."
 The government is asking the court to hand over certain animals to the United States, to allow immediate federal inspection of the Thackerville facility and to bar the Lowes from exhibiting their animals in person or online, among other requests. No attorneys are yet on file for the Lowes.
 The complaint comes nearly a year after the release of the Netflix docu- series, which propelled the story of big cat ownership into national popular culture.

It is worth clarifying here that the Saami do not consider themselves “owners” of the land. They feel responsible for it. Protecting and managing ancestral lands is what the Saami and their families do. Their job is to make sure that no fish are bothered in the rivers, no animals are disturbed in the tundra and no evil people are allowed to step on it. Conscientious nature management is a fashionable way to talk about this today but this has always been the way of life of the northern peoples. The ancestral lands have never been given away for quarries or factories and the Saami have stood to the death for their lands. This is why the glowing crimson stones in the tundra are called “Saami blood”.

While the Leopards had last week off, Trumann (6-5 overall) was battling for their chance to make it to round two of the playoffs. Trumann, who plays in the 3-4A conference, took on Heber Springs in a play-in game for the first round of the playoffs. Trumann cruised past Heber Springs with a 29-point, 43-14, win. As a heavy run offense, Trumann had two players combine for 27 carries for 179 yards and five touchdowns against Heber Springs.
 The defensive line will be the key for the Leopards as they look to get past Trumann and extend their playoff run. “It’s going to be won upfront,” Plumlee said. “I say that a lot but Trumann is a run first offense.”
 Plumlee knows that Trumann is good and efficient on offense running the ball and spent a lot of time this week prepping the defense. With a “bend don’t break” type of philosophy on defense, Plumlee stressed to the Leopards about how important it is to stop Trumann and get their offense off the field. “We’ve spent a lot of time this week on prepping our defense, making sure we can get them off the field,” he said. “They’re very good and very efficient on offense as far as how they run the ball.”
 Offensively, the Leopards are going to continue doing what they’ve done the whole season. They’re going to rely on sophomore quarterback Cedric Simmons while also taking care of the football. “You’re going to see the same style cause we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and rely on Ced [Simmons] to have a good game, lead our offense and disperse the ball where it needs to be,” Plumlee said. This season Simmons has passed for 1,886 yards with 15 touchdowns and rushed for 642 yards with seven touchdowns.
 The Leopards have also been working on staying ahead of the chains, eliminating negative plays, and getting the ball to a third and short situation. It’s a tactic that proved useful in their game against Arkadelphia. “If you go back to Arkadelphia, we had a whole lot of third and fives and third and fours, and we were converting those downs,” he said. “That’s what we’ve been preaching.” It also wouldn’t be surprising to see the Leopards also try to convert on fourth and short either. “We’re pretty aggressive and we’re more than likely going to try to go for it,” Plumlee said.
 Overall the Leopards are excited to get to be playing in front of their home fans for round two of the playoffs. “I think at this time of year anytime you’re at home it’s an advantage,” Plumlee said. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.

As a first step, the Commission will engage with the automotive sector to explore the possibility of effective licensing solutions, the document said, adding that the industry's needs are the most acute. As a first step, the Commission will engage with the automotive sector to explore the possibility of effective licensing solutions, the document said, adding that the industry's needs are the most acute.By Foo Yun Chee      BRUSSELS - The European Commission plans to step into the patent dispute between tech companies and carmakers and may set up a system to check whether some patents are essential to a technology standard as claimed, according to a Commission document.      The move by the EU executive comes as Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia and German automaker Daimler battle in German courts over the level of royalties for key navigation and communications technologies and who should pay them.     
 The proposals are outlined in the Commission's Intellectual Property Action Plan, seen by Reuters, which European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and EU digital chief Thierry Breton will present on Nov. 24.      As a first step, the Commission will engage with the automotive sector to explore the possibility of effective licensing solutions, the document said, adding that the industry's needs are the most acute.      While the car industry currently faces the most problems between standard essential patent (SEP) holders and licensees, the issue is also relevant in the digital and electronics sectors and internet-connected devices in energy, health and smart manufacturing, it said.      The Commission to date has refrained from the disputes and has urged the companies to resolve the issue themselves, with some seeing it as a contractual issue. Carmakers, however, see it as an antitrust issue, with Daimler lodging a complaint with Vestager.      Patents are a lucrative source of revenue for Nokia which makes 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in licensing revenues annually. It says Daimler has been using its cellular standard-essential patents (SEPs) without authorisation.      Daimler however wants Nokia to license its suppliers rather than with the company itself, a move which could cut the level of fees.     
 To further clarify the regulatory framework for declaring, licensing and enforcing SEPs, the Commission will consider regulatory reforms such as setting up an independent system of third-party essentiality checks, the document said.      Such vetting would look into whether some patents are essential to a standard as claimed by the patent holders and also counter fears that some royalties are calculated at too high a level due to companies licensing unnecessary patents.      Experts, however, say essentiality checks may be difficult to carry out in a global market and that it may be difficult to find a qualified body with the technical competence to do them.

 When I was a student, I worked at the campus grill (great way to meet people), provided administrative support for the theatre director (loved learning how to run a soundboard, lighting and especially running the spotlight) and got to put my basic research skills to action when the director of the cafeteria hired me to walk around the dining hall and survey students on their food service likes and dislikes.
   
 A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about student Hannah Dechant's college experience as a freshman. In addition to loving her Learning Community experience, Hannah, an elementary education major from Goodland, also mentioned her on-campus job. "I work at the Fort Hays State University farm, and I love every second I am there. I have shown sheep for 13 years, so I have been around livestock for most of my life, but I am constantly learning more and more everyday while I am at work." One of Hannah's work experiences included helping insert and remove CIDRS (progesterone releasing implants) to synchronize the reproductive cycle for breeding does.
   
 Honestly, I hadn't thought about students having jobs on the university farm. So that got me curious about what other student employment opportunities exist.
   
 Our agriculture student employees are also responsible for checking pregnant cows, using ultrasound to check pregnancy of sows and working on a feed experiment with nursery pigs. They also assist sows during the labor process, including learning how to pull pigs - definitely not the same thing as pulled pork.
   
 Students are driving grain trucks, hauling milo to the elevator. Several student employees are learning how to halter break and gentle down calves while others have been washing, drying and working hair on the sale heifers. Honestly, I don't even know what some of this means - but it sounds more exciting than my job at the campus grill.
   
 We have numerous opportunities for students to engage in student academic support jobs, providing peer-to-peer assistance such as tutoring, assisting with writing, or even helping with grading, preparing class materials and monitoring labs.
   
 Belle Finney, a junior chemistry major from Beloit, is an online tutor for general and organic chemistry, lab prep staffer and front-desk employee. Bryant Karlin, a senior biology major from Victoria, is a learning aide in the Human Cadaver Lab. He helps students with dissections and finding or identifying structures. He also maintains the lab space.
   
 Student Makerspace assistants are printing skulls, trilobites and other artifacts for use by the Sternberg Museum of Natural History. Seth Colson, a Hoisington junior majoring In Applied Technology Studies, has been programming a NAO robot (humanoid) to remind people to wear masks on campus.
   
 The Office of Global Partnerships (OGP) engages its student workers in unique experiences. Graduate student Xiao Sun (Lucia), a professional studies major from Xinzheng, China, helps translate curriculum and vital business documents from our Chinese partner schools. She also serves as an interpreter for administrators during face-to-face and Zoom meetings. Jadyn Snyder, a senior finance major from Lyons, assisted with the behind-the-scenes technical and marketing efforts for seven virtual summer camps for prospective students from China, Cameroon, Turkey and the Bahamas. She also assists with financial duties for the OGP.
   
 Another area of student employment includes undergraduate research. I love the fact that, unlike many universities, our students get to participate in undergraduate research as early as their freshman year. These roles involve data analysis, literature reviews, practicing critical thinking and the scientific process as they evaluate results. Often, students present their research during poster sessions or at academic conferences.
   
 Three students are working on a Laser Biophysics project in the FHSU Physics Department, the Air Force Research Lab and with a defense contractor. Their duties include research on laser effects on human tissue. Two other students are working in our Bat Molecular Biology Lab doing DNA analysis via Guano (bat droppings). I have been assured there is no direct handling of bats this year due to what is yet unknown about COVID transmissibility.
   
 Cody Jiles, a junior physics major from Abilene, works with Dr. Gavin Buffington and lead-scientists at Virginia Tech to keep the SuperDARN radar (the field of antennas on the hill near the FHSU wind turbines) functioning at optimal levels. The knowledge gained from this research provides insight into space weather hazards, including radiation exposure for high-altitude travelers and disruption to GPS and electrical power grids.
   
 An interesting job for student employees in the Department of Art and Design is helping Professor Toby Flores prepare the iron for iron pours and castings. According to Dean Paul Faber, this can require a couple of weeks of "stirring the pot" about once an hour to melt the scrap iron.
   
 Campus programs, including Times Talks, Constitution Day, Voter Registration Day, Red Hand Day (protesting the impressing of children into military service) and Tiger Talkback are all managed by student employees together with volunteers.
   
 That barely scratches the opportunity surface. We have student ambassadors, campus tour guides, Tiger Tots teacher assistants, Intramurals officials and coordinators, wellness center staff, students working in the Sternberg Museum Discovery Room, student athletic trainers, technology support staff and Tiger Media network producers and on-air talent. The list seems endless.
   
 Fort Hays State believes deeply in investing in our students. Student employment maximizes university budgets and clearly produces a significant return on investment. Bottom line - on-campus student employment is a good business, delivering phenomenal value through unique and meaningful high- impact educational experiences.

The pandemic is setting in motion structural changes in how employees do their jobs with profound implications for urban settlement, transport networks and energy use. Journeying to work five days a week now seems excessive in an age of video conferencing and cloud data. In the future, 85% of employees would prefer to work remotely at least two to three days a week, according to a survey by CBRE, the commercial real estate services company.
 Such a scenario could seriously weaken the finances of public transit systems that underpin great cities. No other mode of transportation can efficiently deliver millions of workers into dense central business districts. With fewer riders and fares, transit operators face an unpleasant choice: trimming service, which repels customers, or going cap in hand to the government for more subsidies.

state records for a) total time serving as Texas governor and b) consecutive time serving as Texas governor. He has been governor since Dec. 21, 2000. The previous record for total served, eight years, was held by Republican William P. Clements, who was in office January 1979 to January 1983, and January 1987 to January 1991. To boot, Tucker says, Perry continues to extend both records.

In periods where no-confidence votes are expected, it is not unusual for large sums of public cash and resources to curry favour with MPs. MPs are already courting the two sides to maximise the benefits for themselves and their electorates. Additionally, Marape has sacked some ministers that went to join opposition and has not announced a deputy prime minister. Horse-trading and lobbying will continue unabated as the opponents battle it out. As Prime Minister Marape has said, this battle ‘is not over until it’s over’.

Beyond the breadth of electronic goodies, the other headline is the 540i’s new mild hybrid system. Not only does it prop up fuel economy 13% but it also provides an instant 11hp of e-boost for more immediate acceleration. Combined with launch control, this all-wheel drive 540i takes only 4.6 seconds to reach 60mph, with the inline turbo-6 producing the same 335 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque as before. But even though it’s not any faster on paper, it feels more responsive with quicker bursts of speed as needed. The additional 48-volt battery also serves up smoother and longer stop/start functionality. The only downside, and it’s a small one, is that the regenerative brakes lose a little of their precise touch.
