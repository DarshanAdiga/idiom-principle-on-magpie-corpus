Leonardo Boucheron attended Ipswich Crown Court for a plea and trial preparation hearing on Tuesday. He spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth, nationality and to plead not guilty to the charge. Boucheron, of Park Garden, West Row, near Mildenhall, is accused of having caused another man, Luke Walker, grievous bodily harm, without intent to inflict such harm, last summer. The offence is alleged to have happened in Bury St Edmunds on August 3, 2019. Judge Rupert Overbury instructed that Boucheron's trial be added to a two-week 'warned list' to begin at any point during the fortnight beginning October 26. The trial is expected to last two to three days. Boucheron was released on unconditional bail.

I have a whole collection. Unpublished letters to the editor, unsent texts, correspondence to the Kentucky High School Athletic Association, notes of what I needed to say to superintendents of other nearby districts, business owners and citizens that lived near many of our schools from my time as superintendent of the Owensboro Public Schools all about issues of racism.
 I would on a weekly, if not daily basis, witness structural racism directed at Black students in our school district. I felt a constant anguish in my heart that I was never doing enough in the face of these disgusting displays of inhumanity directed at my students and friends.
 My initial reaction was always to fight back and use my position to label such behavior for what it was — racist. However, on many occasions, I was talked down by those who would rather me take a less outward role toward this issue.
 “This is nothing new, it has been happening for many years,” they said. “We know about it and how to navigate around it.” “It is better if we don’t fight back this way, let’s show them on the court or the playing field.” “We don’t want to start trouble, it will blow up in our face and we will be the ones who end up hurt,” were all the familiar refrains.
 With the events of the past few weeks, there has been an awakening in our nation. Not just in the Black community, but everywhere. It is past time to confront issues that have existed since the founding of the United States, time to stand up, time to call out and end injustice.
 The impact of this awakening hit home for me recently as I read a social media post from a former student who delivered an emotional account of how patrons and management at a local restaurant mistreated her just because she was wearing a Black Lives Matter mask on Juneteenth. According to her account, she was torn apart and brought to tears by the behavior of patrons who disagreed with the statement she was making by wearing the mask. After reading that account, I felt the same gut punch and hole in my heart that I felt as superintendent.
 I struggle to understand how some, especially in such a religiously oriented community, can consciously disagree with the statement Black Lives Matter. Think about the circumstances in this situation: a Black student, recently named one of 44 top scholars from Historically Black Colleges and Universities nationally, working two jobs so that she can earn her education, could not get the white patrons of a restaurant where she was serving them to agree that she mattered. She did not say the white patrons did not matter, in fact, she explicitly told them they did matter. Nor did she say that she matters more. But they could not even accept that. They would not even accept her right to have that as an opinion. According to her account, she was truly hurt. She felt defeated.
 How safe, welcome
 and understood do you think this student will
 feel about her future
 as a college graduate in this community?
 The current awakening is not a result of an increase in racism. Black Americans have been dealing with these kinds of issues for a longer time than any of us who are white can imagine. It is a result of 400 years of oppression in the form of slavery, Jim Crow and mass incarceration, just to name a few.
 The difference with what is happening now and what I experienced as a bystander to similar events during my time as superintendent is that we no longer — and should no longer — accept both systemic and structural racism and as the way things are.
 Black Lives Matter is simply insisting that people understand more deeply what it means for our fellow Black citizens to matter. It is calling out those who oppress or sit idly by and witness the oppression. As a white person, I will never truly understand this because I never have lived it. I have never had to question whether my life mattered or did not matter to others.
 Therein lies the issue. If you never had to truly question that about yourself, then failing to affirm that about a Black life must be a form of resentment tied to race. Claiming that “All Lives Matter” is a blind failure to claim solidarity with a movement that calls out issues of racism as they exist. These ideas should not be tolerated in this or in any community.
 In his book ‘Dying of Whiteness,’ Vanderbilt social psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl identifies the fatal consequences associated with the politics of racial resentment that is killing many of America’s heartland cities like Owensboro. We can either be a place where a bunch of out-of-touch, old white guys cling to a confederate monument on the courthouse lawn, or a place that emphasizes cooperation rather than the false promise of supremacy. The latter communities will be the ones to survive in the coming years — especially as the younger, more tolerant generations begin to vote with their feet about where they want to live.
 I have been overwhelmed by the level of support in our community and worldwide for this movement. I really think the people in the restaurant constitute the minority of who we are as a community and as a people.
 It is important, however, that we all commit to standing up to these people and saying something when they try to associate Black Lives Matter with a radical political statement. It is a simple, human, Christian statement that the lives of Black Americans — our students, neighbors, educators, friends and more — matter. To deny this statement is a failure to recognize the humanity and the 400-year oppression of Black Americans; and a direct repudiation of another statement that seemed radical over 2,000 years ago, “love one another as I have loved you.”

The rates vary dramatically across states—from 1.5 percent in New Jersey to 12 percent a year in Massachusetts—and apply only in cases for which the state has not set or does not permit use of a contract rate, which is typically outlined in the terms for credit cards, loans, and other consumer debt products.63

Wednesday threatsLAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - With things staying quiet for Southwest Louisiana overnight, a batch of very heavy rain continues to move across Southeast Texas and will be on track to begin moving into parts of Southwest Louisiana through the morning and afternoon hours. These storms will have high rainfall rates and could lead to ponding of water in low-lying areas and flood streets for a brief time during the heaviest downpours.Increasing heavy rain threat through the morningSouthwest Louisiana will begin to see rain chances increase rather quickly after sunrise and continue to remain high for the remainder of the morning and into the afternoon. This as a very low moving area of upper level low pressure moves across the southern half of the state. Computer models keep the highest rain totals south of I-10, but really anywhere in Southwest Louisiana is fair game today for some localized flooding, anywhere the bands of heaviest rain set up.Wednesday day plannerIt’s important to stay alert today and be ready to turn around if you are driving and come across a flooded road. Flooding is one of the number one weather related killers and can simply be avoided by staying off flooded roads. Models are showing at least 1 to 2 inches of rain today but some indications are that heavy downpours that set up over small localized areas could easily provide double that amount in a short period of time as the copious amount of tropical moisture in the atmosphere will result in high rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour in some instances.Computer models are also slowing down the progression of this low over the next 24 to 48 hours which will keep higher rain chances in play for Thursday, although storms will be a bit more scattered in coverage and there should be breaks at times in between the heaviest downpours. We’ll also be on track for the arrival of Saharan Dust tomorrow, so you’ll notice more vibrant looking sunrises and sunsets along with some reduction in air quality although no major risk to our health as only those most sensitive should notice impacts including those with asthma or are otherwise are diagnosed with chronic lung disease or have other respiratory problems.Saharan dust increasing ThursdayThe plume of Saharan Dust will be rather thick compared to what we’ve seen in years past, so you’ll notice things looking a lot hazier than normal beginning tomorrow and continuing into the weekend. This will help suppress rain chances by Friday along with the departure of the stalled front that’s over us now, but a few widely scattered storms won’t be totally ruled out any day through the weekend.Effects of the dustFirst Alert Meteorologist Ben TerryCopyright 2020 KPLC.

ROCKPORT, IND. — Norman George Feige Jr., a resident of Rockport, Indiana, died on June 17th at his home in his 88th year. The Bucket List had been completed and it was time, after a long illness, to take on that last, great adventure.
 Born in Evansville, Indiana, to the late Norman and Mary Pyle Feige, he was raised in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. He graduated from the School of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin as a metallurgical engineer and earned credits toward a Master’s Degree at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He spent the majority of his professional career in the titanium industry, where he was responsible for the engineering and manufacturing of materials as well as several management positions. He published 33 papers within the metals industry and earned 5 patents.
 Later in his career he established an independent consulting firm that provided technical support in material applications and evaluation of material field failures. He was a member of several professional societies and in 1985 was made a Fellow in the American Society for Metals.
 For 32 years he lived with his family in South Salem, New York, where he volunteered with the local conservation group. The bulk of his volunteer time, however, was spent with Troop 1 Lewisboro of the Boy Scouts of America as a board member, District Commissioner and participant in the many activities in which his sons were involved. In 1994 he retired from engineering and moved to Rockport, Indiana to a farm which had been owned by his parents in their retirement. Another great adventure began as he learned about pastures, beef cattle, and the maintenance of all those machines! During this time, he became a member of the Investigators Club of Owensboro, Kentucky, an association he enjoyed very much.
 He is survived by his wife, Adrienne; and their sons, Eric, his wife, Corri, and their daughter, Sidney, of Alaska; Hans, his wife, Tammy, and their daughter, Charlotte, of Oregon; and Leif, and his wife, Tammy, of Maine. A brother-in-law, Allan B. Wheeler, of Wisconsin, also survives; as do numerous nieces, nephews, and a host of friends, both personal and professional.
 He was preceded in death by his parents, his sister, Elizabeth Feige Wheeler, and a nephew, Allan Wheeler.
 There will be no formal services at this time. Boultinghouse Funeral Home in Rockport, Indiana has been entrusted with care.
 It was his wish that his ashes be scattered at sea. Later in the year his family will gather to accomplish that. As a young adult, ocean sailing and racing were an important part of Norm’s life. His most profound experience at sea was a year spent as a third mate on a 92 foot Brigantine sailing ship named the Albatross. It was an extended voyage around Africa at a time when the continent was still in colonial hands. The experience influenced his life ever after.
 His family asks that memorial gifts be made to the Good Samaritan Fund at Settle Memorial United Methodist Church, 201 E. 4th St. Owensboro, KY 42303, or to the South Spencer Scholarship Foundation, c/o South Spencer High School, 1142 Orchard Rd., Rockport, IN 47635.
 Finally, his family wishes to thank the good people of Home Instead and Heart to Heart Hospice for the care and concern they showed Norm and his family in these last months. They made the journey to the end of his life a little easier.
 Friends may leave a condolence for the family at www.BoultinghouseFuneral

The Green River District Health Department on Tuesday reported 13 new confirmed COVID-19 cases throughout its district.
 According to the department, there were eight new cases in Daviess County, one in Hancock, three in Henderson and one in Union.
 For Daviess County, these heightened numbers are part of an increase of cases over the past week as social restrictions have eased and people are traveling more and increasing their sphere of social interactions, said Clay Horton, department public health director.
 “We had 62 cases last week that was up from the previous four or five weeks,” he said. “We have seen people listing travel more than we were, but I don’t know if you can say that it is a significant cause. Travel is one part of us seeing more cases in terms of social interactions across the board. In our recent cases, the number of contacts are higher and more spread out. Early on, we had a period where it was travel cases and a couple of months where it was workplace and now it is across the board.”
 “Predicting the behavior of people is difficult,” he said. “The virus is predictable in that it still wants to spread. People may be getting tired of being quarantined and being isolated, but the virus isn’t tired of making people sick. If people aren’t being cautious, we will continue to see increased numbers and further spread of the virus.”
 As COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to rise in states like Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Alabama and California, many are already fearing a second wave and its impact, especially as businesses and other attractions begin to reopen.
 Daviess County has been fortunate, said Daviess County Judge-Executive Al Mattingly, but moving forward, the best practice is personal responsibility.
 ”The virus is still there,” he said. “It is still out there and we need to continue to social distance, wear masks and wash our hands all of things that we were doing that drove it down. It is going to take a great many things to combat the spread of the virus like treatment and an eventual vaccine, but right now the best weapon we have is personal and social responsibility. Compared to counties like Warren, Fayette, Jefferson and Hopkins, Daviess County has been fortunate.”
 While there are strategies in place to address a potential “second wave” and significantly more resources than were available at the beginning of the shutdowns, the best weapon we have to truly contain and get through the age of COVID is a change in behavior, Horton said.
 “Fundamentally, people have to change their behavior,” he said. “They have to apply what we have learned these last three months, which includes limiting interactions and when you can’t wear a face mask. People don’t want to do it, but it is effective. If we get good compliance we won’t see a lot of spread. We need to, as a community, use those lessons learned on a universal basis. If we are going to have a real impact, we have to have people adopt these strategies in their everyday lives and in their community.”

Stando al relativo comunicato stampa, i titoli hanno una scadenza a 15 anni e prevedono la possibilità di un solo richiamo anticipato da parte dell'emittente dopo il decimo anno alla pari, previa autorizzazione da parte dell'autorità di vigilanza. Le obbligazioni pagano una cedola fissa in dollari pari al 5,459 per cento all'anno per i primi dieci anni corrisposta su base semestrale, equivalente a uno spread in euro pari a 475 punti base sul tasso del Tesoro Usa a dieci anni. Se non richiamate dall'emittente, la cedola verrà rideterminata in base al tasso del Tesoro Usa a cinque anni maggiorato di uno spread pari a 475 punti base. L'emissione, prosegue la nota, consente a Unicredit di completare l'esecuzione della componente subordinata del piano di Funding 2020 ai fini Tlac, contribuendo a rafforzare ulteriormente il Total Capital Ratio. La guidance iniziale di 510 punti base sul Tesoro Usa a dieci anni ha registrato in seguito un miglioramento di 35 punti base. Lo spread di emissione finale è stato quindi fissato a T +475 punti base, equivalente a +415 punti base sopra il tasso swap a 10 anni in euro. (Com)

Despite denying persistent rumors that it would exit the camera business, Olympus is doing exactly that. The company has announced that will sell its camera business to Japan Industrial Partners (JIP), the same company that purchased Sony's VAIO PC division (via The Verge). Olympus will now focus on its much larger business supplying industrial and medical equipment.Olympus said it improved cost structure, focused on high-profit cameras and lenses and took other steps to "cope with the extremely severe digital camera market." Despite those efforts, however, the company said it "recorded operating losses for three consecutive fiscal years up to the term ended in March 2020." It likely didn't help that the company was rocked by a $1.7 billion accounting scandal in 2013. It's unclear how this might affect owners of Olympus mirrorless cameras like the flagship O-MD E-M1 Mark III. JIP plans to streamline the business as it did with VAIO to make it "more compact, efficient and agile," according to Olympus. It will also sell the existing models and develop new ones, so it would presumably support current camera owners. Beyond that, we don't know what JIP plans to do with Olympus, and it didn't exactly bring Sony's former VAIO division to greatness. Olympus has implemented measures to cope with the extremely severe digital camera market, due to, amongst others, rapid market shrink caused by the evolution of smartphones; Olympus has improved the cost structure by restructuring the manufacturing bases and focusing on high-value-added interchangeable lenses, aiming to rectify the earning structure to those that may continue generating profit even as sales dwindles. Despite all such efforts, Olympus's Imaging business recorded operating losses for 3 consecutive fiscal years up to the term ended in March 2020. Last year, Olympus CEO Yasuo Takeuchi let slip that a sale of its consumer camera division wasn't out of the question. However, the company took pains to walk that comment back, and marketing and sales VP Akihiko Murata also told Engadget that "we want to say to our users, 'Please count on us.'"After reviewing the O-MD E-M1 III earlier this year, I was struck by the company's lack of innovation on its flagship camera compared to other manufacturers. It's normally an ominous sign for a company when it stops developing new product tech.The sale of Olympus also has implications for the camera world at large. Olympus and Panasonic are the only companies supporting the Micro Four Thirds format, a segment playing third-fiddle to APS-C and full-frame systems. Those larger sensors are better in low light and produce soft "bokeh" backgrounds, helping camera manufacturers like Sony distinguish its products from increasingly excellent smartphone cameras.Olympus still relies exclusively on Micro Four Thirds for its interchangeable lens cameras. However, Panasonic now has its own lineup of full-frame mirrorless cameras that have attracted a lot of attention, particularly in the video market. That gives it other options depending on what happens to Olympus, so we'll be keeping a close on both companies over the next few months. Following due diligence, the sale will conclude by September 3rd, 2020, Olympus said.

The town of Needham added just three cases of COVID-19 in the second week of June, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's weekly report released June 17 documenting COVID-19 cases by city and town. As of last Wednesday, a total of 328 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus.
 The data showed Needham's reported positivity rate continues to fall -- 13.67% of Needham residents who have been tested for COVID-19 subsequently received a positive result. The figure was reported at 14.66% last week. The latest fatality information provided from the town showed 70 deaths as of June 8.
 Speaking at his daily press conference June 17, Gov. Charlie Baker pointed to positive trends at the state level and said hospitalizations are down over 70% since the middle of April. The daily DPH report released the day of the governor's address showed 1,000 Massachusetts residents were hospitalized from COVID-19 on Wednesday, with 244 requiring intensive care.
 "This progress is obviously encouraging and shows that we continue to move in the right direction," Baker said. "It also puts us on a good trajectory with respect to our gradual plans associated with reopening."
 The governor praised the state's residents for their role in slowing the spread of the coronavirus.
 "Our administration firmly believes that much of our progress has been the result of the behavior and vigilance of the people of Massachusetts," Baker said.
 On Monday of this week, the same day that Step Two of Phase II of the state- led reopening plan began, DPH reported 149 new cases and 17 additional deaths - a total of 107,210 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the state and 7,874 have died. The Monday report showed 920 patients with COVID-19 in hospitals across the state - including 13 suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Needham, with 2 people requiring intensive care.
 On April 15, when the total number of cases reported in Massachusetts was under 30,000, the state reported 1,755 new cases and 151 new deaths. On the same day, Beth Israel Lahey Health reported 25 patients with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6 requiring intensive care.

BENGALURU -- Indian shares snapped four straight sessions of gains on Wednesday, as investors booked profits in banking stocks amid fears of a rise in loan defaults due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The markets opened higher but reversed their course around midday as the focus turned to record levels of coronavirus infections in several U.S. states, spurring concerns about the pace of a nascent economic recovery. European shares fell 1.8%.
 The Nifty bank index fell 3.8%, the top loser among 11 sectoral indexes. It has risen 11% so far this month, driven by strong March-quarter earnings and a flood of liquidity from global investors.
 Investors booked profits in banking stocks due to the recent run-up and also driven by concerns about a rise in soured loans, especially as many borrowers opt for a moratorium on loan repayments, and the outlook for loan growth, said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities in Mumbai.
 "The key concerns are that credit growth is not happening, and asset quality is under question across the board," Jasani said. "These two things are bothering investors."
 The NSE Nifty 50 index closed 1.58% lower at 10,305.30, while the S&P BSE Sensex also shed 1.58% to settle at 34,868.98.
 The Nifty 50 has risen 7.6% so far this month, helped partly by foreign institutional investors, who are benefiting from access to higher liquidity.
 Both ICICI Bank Ltd and IndusInd Bank Ltd dropped 7.5%.
 Strong quarterly margins drove shares of Asian Paints Ltd up 3.8%, making them the top gainers on the Nifty 50.
 Meanwhile, cases of coronavirus infections rose to 456,183 in India, with the death toll reaching 14,476. (Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)

A look at recent moves
 This sizable liquidity position might have left some investors in the company feeling comfortable, but it’s important to keep in mind that keeping the business running is more than just about liquidity. It’s also about the perception of the business’s ability to remain afloat. Even though liquidity may be ample, if debt is too high and/or if liquidity drops low enough that it might make future capital contributors worried about the firm’s prospects, it may be difficult, or even impossible, for American Airlines to raise cash down the road.
 It is likely that, combined with fears that COVID-19 cases are on the rise, that led the firm to act pre-emptively to bolster its balance sheet further. As part of this, the company announced plans to issue $1.5 billion worth of Senior Secured Notes that will come due in 2025. This is on top of tapping a $500 million Term Loan B Facility that will come due in 2024. If it were just these debt issuances, though, there wouldn’t be much to write about. What’s really interesting, and for shareholders painful, is what else management decided to jump into.
 As part of its capital raising efforts, the firm decided to raise $750 million from the issuance of common shares, plus $750 million from the issuance of Convertible Senior Notes that mature in 2025. Originally, underwriters received the right to invest a further $112.50 million for common stock, plus $112.50 million for even more Convertible Senior Notes. Since issuing this announcement, though, the picture changed. On June 23rd, management revised its target, now aiming for roughly $1 billion in common stock and $1 billion in Convertible Senior Notes. Underwriters now have the right to receive $150.1 million in common shares, plus $150 million in additional Convertible Senior Notes.
 Let’s begin, first, with the common stock, since that’s the simplest. In all, American Airlines is issuing 74.10 million common shares of itself to investors at a price of $13.50 per unit. This represents a discount of 15.6%, compared to the $16 that shares closed at on June 19th. Underwriters may also receive 11.115 million common shares if they exercise their 30-day option, with these units receiving the same price that the larger common issuance is receiving. After factoring in underwriting discounts, American Airlines is projected to receive net proceeds of between $966.8 million and $1.112 billion (depending on whether the underwriters’ option is exercised).

As we all know, shopping is so much fun when faced with huge selections of items you love. However, shopping can quickly have a negative effect if you are prone to spending too much. Let's take a close look at how to be financially responsible while shopping.
 Shopping Lists
 Shopping lists naturally help you to be financially responsible. Without a list, it's easy to be tempted by everything while in the store. You don't have anything on your agenda, so you're essentially buying at will. Soon enough, you've loaded up your cart with lots of things that you don't really need. With a shopping list, you know exactly which items you need when you enter the store. This helps you to make rational decisions instead of in the spur of the moment. Create the list at home when you are thinking critically about your finances. This will also help you to know which aisle of the store to go to. Without a list, you will have to walk through almost every aisle, which will only tempt you to buy more than is necessary.
 Online Shopping
 Online shopping is another fantastic approach. Not only are there more products to choose from online, but these stores have a number of unique features. Technology can help you save as much money when you checkout with your credit card. First, install an app such as Checkout Saver. Then, whenever you make a purchase online, it will automatically apply any eligible coupons and discounts. You hardly have to do a thing except select the item in the first place. Moreover, you receive cashback instantly upon each purchase. Some online shopping sites also allow you to bypass certain taxes due to the country of origin. When you factor in free shipping that is becoming so abundant, online retailers are excellent choices for financially minded shoppers. Most of these stores accept credit cards, debit cards and other payment services, so you have all your normal financial tools at your disposal.
 Gift Cards
 Finally, gift cards are other great options. When you buy discount gift cards, you're investing a certain sum of money to get back even more. It's essentially free cash. As long as you plan to shop at the store in the near future, there's really no reason to not opt for discount gift cards. In addition, gift cards give you a realistic limit of how much you can spend. As mentioned above, when you're armed with a credit card and no shopping list, it's very easy to go overboard with your purchases. With a gift card, you can't reach this limit of infinity without at least thinking twice about what you are doing. Because you acquired the gift card at a discounted price, you can feel good about your actions at the same time.
 Conclusion
 In conclusion, it's important to be financially responsible while shopping. Although your credit card may seem like an endless supply of money, it's really not. Choices you make now will come back to bite you later, so use your best discretion when making purchases.

With the sea of information available online, it is necessary to impart 'digital literacy' tips to people as it will only help them to differentiate fact from highly toxic and even dangerous fiction, suggests a new study.Researchers studying Facebook's efforts to educate users on how to spot misinformation have found people in the United States and India were less likely to say a false headline was true after they were exposed to tips on how to spot misinformationThe Princeton University-led study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), shows people's ability to spot erroneous information weakened over time, so digital literacy needs to be taught with regularity."Most people struggle to reliably evaluate the quality of information they encounter online, even under the most ideal conditions," said Andy Guess, assistant professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University."This is because they lack the skills and knowledge required to distinguish between high and low-quality news content. We find that effort to promote digital literacy can improve people's ability to evaluate the accuracy of online content," Guess added. This study is among the first to systematically explore the role of digital media literacy shortfalls."Digital literacy and media literacy are often proposed as solutions to online misinformation, but these approaches are not evaluated as often as they are proposed. If we want to develop tools that help people distinguish truth from falsity, it is essential to test the effectiveness of these tools," added Professor Jason Reifler from the University of Exeter.The team originally set out to explore why people fall victim to misinformation, selecting the United States and India as both countries have struggled with misinformation campaigns, especially during national elections.The team looked at the effects of Facebook's "Tips to Spot False News," which appeared at the top of users' news feeds in 14 countries in April 2017. The list was also printed as a full-page ad in many U.S. newspapers, and a version appeared in India as well.These tips have likely been the most widely distributed digital- media literacy intervention. They also are not overly complex, allowing for quick decision-making. For example, one tip cautions readers to be skeptical of headlines, warning that if claims sound unbelievable, they probably are.The researchers then employed a "two-wave panel design," studying the same group of people immediately after exposure to the tips, and then again several weeks later, allowing them to see whether the digital media literacy efforts took root over time.Participants were exposed to the tips and then presented with the same series of mock headlines, which they rated for accuracy. The headlines were balanced in terms of partisan slant, well-known and lesser- known media outlets, as well as low-quality and mainstream content. While the tips were offered to respondents, they couldn't be forced to read them, so the researchers took this into account in their modeling.This two-wave design was conducted online in both the U.S. and India, though in-person interviews were also conducted in areas of rural India where there is greater religious polarization and a potentially higher risk of misinformation spread.The team found that the intervention improved people's ability to discern between mainstream and false news headlines by 26.5 per cent in the U.S. and 17.5 per cent in India. In the U.S., this lessened but remained measurable several weeks later. One-third of participants also were more likely to point out a less accurate headline. Their ratings of false headlines as "very accurate" or "somewhat accurate" went from 32 per cent to 24 per cent.While the online results between the two countries were similar, India's face-to-face interviews yielded different results. There was no evidence that exposure to the tips increased the perceived accuracy of mainstream news articles. However, this group had much less experience with evaluating news headlines online.The researchers listed a few caveats with their work. First, the effects were modest, and the intervention did not completely eliminate belief in false news headlines. The effects also decayed over time, suggesting the need for regular reinforcement of these lessons. Lastly, it's not clear whether everyone actually read the tips.The study provides opportunities for future research. Rather than using an intervention done by a tech company, academics could take this into their own hands by sampling people in other countries and electoral contexts. Likewise, more intensive training models could be used to see if the effects are more durable."We see no reason why this wouldn't work for any type of misinformation. Currently, there are sources spreading misleading or even dangerous information about Covid-19 regarding protective measures, vaccines, miracle cures. We think this intervention could work in the public health domain, as well," Guess said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. Only the headline has been changed.)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter
