Ambitiously marketed as an “anti-hate movie”, it’s no wonder that _Jojo Rabbit_ only fails when taken too seriously and over-analysed for all the things it may or may not be implying about the current state of affairs in the US and a certain President that Hollywood loves to hate (and yes, sometimes even compare to Hitler). And whenever the film takes itself too seriously – particularly with one devastating moment that comes out of the blue – it fails because it pops the comfy satirical bubble and begs the ‘is he being serious right now?’ question both literally and figuratively. That’s when the satire starts to feel flippant and when it’s easy to remember that making fun of Nazis is a very, very easy and safe thing to do.

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's impeachment trial may not result in his removal from office, but it could help determine whether his Republicans retain control of the Senate in the November congressional elections.
 For the handful of senators who face tough re-election battles this year, their vote to acquit or convict Trump, or even to call witnesses in the trial, could loom large when voters consider whether to give them another six-year term, analysts said.
 Republican strategist James Bowers predicted that the impeachment will play a major role in campaign ads for years.
 "We will be seeing the ghost of this impeachment for (election) cycles to come," Bowers said.
 Democrats need to pick up four seats from Republicans to win a majority in the Nov. 3 election, in which Trump also will be on the ballot. Democratic political groups are scouring their media appearances for statements that could be used against them.
 Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in December, alleging he abused his powers and obstructed Congress for pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
 Trump says he has done nothing wrong, and his acquittal is seen as likely in the Senate because at least 20 Republicans would have to vote for his removal.
 Embattled Republicans like Corey Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona might face a voter backlash if they vote to wrap up the trial quickly, as Republican leaders want, instead of calling for more evidence and witnesses, which could potentially upend the proceeding.
 "It could add to their potential problems, if they look like partisan soldiers and not independent, free-thinking senators," said Stuart Rothenberg, senior editor at Inside Elections, a campaign newsletter.
 Voting against further evidence would shore up support from Trump conservatives back home, but it could hurt their chances of appealing to independent voters in states such as Maine, where Republican Senator Susan Collins is hoping to win a fifth six-year term.
 Collins already was facing a backlash over her vote for the 2017 tax-cut bill and her 2018 vote to confirm conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
 Now, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats, has launched a website to pressure her to vote for more witnesses and evidence, as she did in the 1999 impeachment trial of Democratic President Bill Clinton.
 The normally easygoing Collins has bristled lately over trial procedures, after casting several preliminary votes against witnesses and evidence. She said she likely will vote to subpoena witnesses after both sides present their cases.
 "This thoughtful approach is what Mainers appreciate most," Collins spokesman Kevin Kelley said.
 Gardner has sidestepped the question in Washington and at home in Colorado. A Gardner campaign official said political concerns would not influence his decisions during the trial.
 McSally has taken a more confrontational approach, calling a CNN reporter a "liberal hack" after he asked her whether she would vote to see more evidence, and set up a website at http://www.liberalhack.com to raise money off the incident. Her office declined to comment.
 Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, another Republican running hard for re-election, has frequently criticized the Democrats' case for impeachment during breaks in the trial.
 Asked by Reuters about Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine, Ernst said, "He will do what he wants to do. It's probably not the way I would have handled it."
 Another vulnerable Republican, North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, showed no sign of concern earlier this week, telling reporters that he intends to vote for Trump's acquittal.
 Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, warned that Democrats risk overplaying their hand because many independent voters did not want to see an impeachment trial in the first place.
 "Democrats are taking a big gamble, because it could just as easily go against them," he said. (Reporting by Richard Cowan and David Morgan; additional reporting by Susan Cornwell Editing by Andy Sullivan and Cynthia Osterman)

"You were talking in your sleep last night," I said to my husband when he stumbled into the kitchen that morning. I handed him a cup of Espresso to jolt him out of his coma.
 "No, I wasn't," he said.
 "How would you know," I said. "You were asleep. I was not asleep ... because you were talking in your sleep."
 "I don't talk in my sleep," he said as he sat down at the table. The dog came over for a scratch behind the ears or maybe just to take my husband's side.
 "Well, you did last night," I said. "And you were very adamant about it."
 Now my husband was interested. I'm sure he thought he had perhaps divulged some husband secret from deep within his subconscious, like, the fact that he purposely hangs the toilet paper the wrong way just to make me crazy.
 "What did I say?" he wondered.
 "Begone," I replied.
 "I said 'begone?'" he repeated.
 "Yes."
 He shook his head. "I would never say 'begone.' I'd say 'Get lost,' but I wouldn't say 'begone.' I think you heard it wrong. Maybe I said, 'poupon.'"
 "Were you dreaming about mustard?" I said.
 "Unlikely," he admitted. We were both silent as we wondered what had inspired him to yell out "begone" in his sleep. Maybe he had dreamed he was a king's attendant in a Shakespeare play, or a French knight in a Monty Python movie. Perhaps he was a hobbit standing his ground in the Shire, or a constable clearing the cobblestone streets of Old England from lollygaggers. Or maybe he dreamed it was 200 years ago and I was berating him for hanging the toilet paper the wrong way and he yelled at me to "begone."
 This wasn't the first time he had talked in his sleep. There was the time he did a musical countdown and conducted an orchestra while he slept, smacking me in the face as he directed the string section. Another time he yelled out, 'Who's there!" and I jumped out of bed and hid in the closet thinking there was an intruder in the house. And one time he told me to bring the camels inside, even though we lived in the suburbs and we weren't zoned for domesticated desert pets.
 Sleeping with my husband was not restful, but it was certainly entertaining.
 "Did I say anything else," he asked, hoping for some insight into the source of his nocturnal mumblings.
 I thought for a moment. He had said some other things but mostly under his breath so I couldn't make them out.
 "I don't know," I finally said. "Maybe I dreamed it."
 "Probably," he said. "'Cuz I would never say 'begone.'"
 "Okay. Anyway, honey, I have to run," I said, putting on my jacket. "I have an appointment. Would you mind taking the dog out?" I thrust the leash at him.
 "Fine," he said. "Begone."

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Supporters of a regional pact that would tackle transportation emissions are struggling to win over several New England governors concerned that the climate change initiative will increase gas prices. After the Transportation and Climate Initiative was announced last month, New Hampshire's Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said the state won't join, citing fears of a gas price hike. Vermont's Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he couldn't support the initiative if it amounts to a tax on carbon. A spokesman for Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said the state has yet to sign a draft memorandum of understanding for the TCI, citing the unique challenges of addressing transportation in a rural state. The initiative is aimed at a dozen Northeast and mid-Atlantic states and would take effect in 2022. It would address pollution from transportation — which represents 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in the region, the largest source of emissions. The area has tens of millions of registered vehicles. New Jersey has not committed to implementing the initiative while a spokesman for Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said his administration was still examining it. Virginia is also reviewing the draft memorandum. “I am happy to see that other Governors are following my lead in rightfully sounding the alarm on this new gas tax,\" Sununu said in a statement. \"New Hampshire is proof that the best environmental stewardship can be achieved without massive tax schemes.” Many of the states are already part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which covers 10 states in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic and targets emissions from the power sector. Under the agreement, wholesale fuel companies would be required to purchase pollution allowances at auction. The sale of those allowances could generate billions for states...

I didn't make it to midnight on New Year's Eve. Well, I guess technically I did since I didn't actually fall asleep until after midnight. But I was in bed with the lights out when the clock, that I didn't hear, struck the new year.
 Over the years, I've come to recognize that the arrival of the new year isn't dependent upon my staying awake to ring it in. Whether or not I'm awake at the stroke of midnight, the new year still arrives. And that's rather freeing! Despite the more-than-you'd-think emails mistakenly addressed to me as "Father Time," I bear no responsibility for the transition from one year to the next.
 I didn't make any New Year's resolutions this year. This isn't unusual for me, as I can't remember the last time I did. I can get all philosophical, "time is a false construct," or delude myself into thinking to channel Mr. Rogers, I'm fine just the way I am. While my wife and brother have made a pact to give up sugar, I just couldn't come up with anything. Despite all the "New Year! New You!" ads for gyms and hair care products, I'm pretty sure God still loves the old me.
 This week a friend forwarded me an article about a Lutheran pastor from Canada with the headline "Meet the Strongest Priest in the World." Apparently, the Rev. Kevin Fast, who bears a strong resemblance to a jacked-up Santa Claus, pulled three firetrucks weighing 109 tons across a 100-foot parking lot in just 34 seconds. He's also on record, with video evidence, as having pulled 15 cars at once.
 All of which is to say, I could resolve to double my efforts at the gym. Pastor Fast, maybe I could, ironically enough, outrun him, makes my exploits on the StairMaster at Planet Fitness seem rather pedestrian.
 I didn't eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day. This brings good luck, apparently. Black-eyed peas weren't part of my tradition growing up, or maybe my parents just decided to take their chances. But either way, seeing all those Facebook posts of people preparing black-eyed peas for their New Year's Day celebrations makes me wonder what I'm missing and how luckier I'd be if I'd partaken.
 There's evidence that the tradition goes back to Rosh Hashanah and the celebration of the Jewish New Year, but these days it's mostly a Southern thing. In the Civil War era, black-eyed peas were grown as food for livestock and became a staple of slaves. When Gen. Sherman undertook his infamous March to the Sea, he destroyed all the crops deemed useful to the Confederate Army. He ignored the black-eyed peas, figuring they weren't fit for human consumption. Those left in the South gratefully subsisted on the peas and ever since they have been viewed as a symbol of luck and prosperity, particularly fit for a celebration of the New Year.
 So while 2020 begins for me with many unrealized traditions, I am nonetheless optimistic. Hindsight may indeed be 2020, but I pray that we will have the foresight to live into the future with peace, hope, and love. In the end, that's really all that matters.

That's the conclusion of new satellite imagery from a critical North Korean missile site that shows increased vehicle activity in the area. US officials and intelligence analysts say that while the activity is similar to what they've seen before other missile or missile fuel tests, it's too early to tell in this case. However, given North Korea's current state of mind, it's not out of the question. Kim Jong Un recently announced he would no longer abide by self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons or long-range missiles testing after talks with President Trump fizzled without a resolution. Now, Kim is trying to play nuclear hardball to get Washington to give in to his political demands.

Monday's presentation is expected to include appearances by Alan Dershowitz, who will argue that impeachable offenses require criminal-like conduct, and Ken Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is also expected to make arguments.
 Many legal scholars reject Dershowitz's arguments, saying the Founding Fathers meant for impeachable offenses to incorporate a broad range of conduct by presidents. Dershowitz told The Associated Press last week that he understood that some critics thought his argument was “bonkers” but encouraged them to listen nonetheless.
 Democrats argued their side of the impeachment case for three days last week, warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election.
 On Saturday, the president's attorneys said there was no evidence that Trump made the military aid contingent on the country announcing an investigation into Biden. They also accused Democrats of omitting information that was favorable to Trump's case.
 Once Trump's team concludes, senators will have 16 hours to ask questions of both the House impeachment prosecutors and the president's legal team. Their questions must be in writing, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been presiding over the trial, will read them aloud.
 Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told reporters Saturday that Republicans expected to get together on Monday to start formulating a list of questions.
 “We will meet as a conference and decide what questions we want to pose, what the order may be of those of those questions,” he said.
 After the question-and-answer time has elapsed, the Senate will take up the question of whether to consider new witnesses and evidence — a question that could be more politically complicated with the account in Bolton's book.
 Four Republicans would have to break ranks to join Democrats to extend the trial for an undetermined amount of time.
