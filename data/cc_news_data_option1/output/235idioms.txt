As the bids for the nation’s first 5G auction have far exceeded expectations, the Executive Yuan would use the surplus profits to fund projects that would serve the public interest, Executive Yuan spokeswoman Kolas Yotaka said on Friday.
 The bids have totaled more than NT$138 billion (US$4.60 billion), more than tripling the National Communications Commission’s expectation of NT$44 billion, Kolas said.
 The Executive Yuan plans to use the money to finance 5G infrastructure, narrow the digital development gap between urban and rural areas, and promote online events that advance the public interest, she added.
 Academics have suggested setting up a dedicated fund to develop 5G infrastructure and boost the technical capabilities of related industries.
 The excess profits would be listed as central government revenue for this fiscal year, Kolas said, adding that the government might channel the money to agencies that have drawn up plans to bridge the digital divide in the nation.
 Although building base stations in hard-to-reach areas could be unfeasible, the government might deem them necessary to facilitate rescue missions in mountainous areas, an official with knowledge of the matter said.
 In other news, President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) administration is drafting a national action plan to pave the way for Taiwan’s admission to the Open Government Partnership (OGP), sources said.
 Tsai has tasked the Executive Yuan with preparing the first version of the plan by May, the sources said.
 They cited Minister Without Portfolio Audrey Tang (唐鳳) as saying during a Cabinet meeting that prospective OGP members must have made efforts to protect the freedom of speech and democracy, making China’s participation unlikely, which could benefit Taiwan’s bid to join the initiative.

Defensive tackle DeForest Buckner recalled talking to Zgonina about it last season before these teams met in October on Monday Night Football, a game the Packers would win 33-30 at Lambeau Field.
 "[He] would call it the wrist flick from hell,” Buckner said. “He would get that little — kind of like avoiding rushers and everything and just — you see that wrist flick, and you’re like, ‘Oh, Lord.’ Know what I mean? You know somebody is going to come down with it. Yeah, he’s just a special player.”
 The 49ers will counter with a quarterback they, too, believe has special qualities. Jimmy Garoppolo is 22-5 as an NFL starter and such a force in the Bay Area that people walk around here wearing T-shirts bearing his favorite slogan: “Feels Great, Baby.”
 Garoppolo didn’t have to do much last weekend in San Francisco’s 27-10 win over Minnesota. After an impressive, touchdown-producing opening drive, the 49ers kept the Vikings down by running the ball 47 times.
 It made for a shockingly comfortable afternoon for a team that had its previous five games decided on the last play or in the final seconds.
 “It was great to finally not have a heart-attack game,” left tackle Joe Staley said. “That was a great recipe for winning football.”
 A week later, San Francisco will attempt to duplicate that performance.
 Eight weeks later, Green Bay will try to change things completely, to turn a laugher into a last laugh.

Crytek recently requested their lawsuit against Cloud Imperium Games be dismissed without prejudice and without conditions so they can refile upon the release of Squadron 42, since part of the lawsuit hinges on the game licence agreement (GLA) between the two companies only allowing CIG to use Crytek's engine for one game, Star Citizen. CIG dispute this, saying the GLA allowed it to use Cryengine for both, that Squadron 42 is accessed via the same launcher as Star Citizen anyway, and also that it's switched to Amazon's Lumberyard engine rather than Cryengine rendering the whole thing baseless.
 The lawsuit has some more layers to it than that, but let's not peel the whole onion right now and instead concentrate on just the latest development: CIG filing a court document on January 17 demanding that the lawsuit instead be dismissed with prejudice rather than without, meaning that Crytek would have to pay at least some of CIG's legal fees.
 You can read CIG's court document online, and it's certainly got some spice to it, calling Crytek's action "attention-seeking" and insisting that, "Crytek should not be allowed to aim its car at CIG's storefront window, stomp the accelerator, smash through, do doughnuts for years, then back out and drive away to maybe circle around and crash CIG again another day.  Crytek richly deserves having its keys taken away for all time, so that CIG can conduct responsible business without further interference from Crytek or its series of lawyers."
 The document also accuses Crytek of "falsely claiming that CIG did not switch to Amazon Lumberyard", the engine CIG say Star Citizen is now using instead of Cryengine, "and pretending that "new information" came out in discovery about the timing of the future release of SQ42.  In fact, nothing about release timing for SQ42 has been shared with Crytek."
 CIG is requesting the release of a $500,000 security bond Crytek paid on filing "At the very least". Crytek have until February 7 to respond in turn.

Las colas del paro en Canarias estan llenas de licenciados en Derecho y diplomados en Ciencias Empresariales. Y los diplomados en Turismo y en Relaciones Laborales les acompañan, y es que estos son los cuatro titulos con mas desempleados en el Archipielago segun datos recopilados por el Observatorio Canario de Empleo (Obecan) a partir de la informacion que aportaron durante diciembre de 2019 los demandantes de trabajo en las oficinas de empleo de Canarias.
 La licenciatura de Derecho figura en el curriculo de 746 desempleados de las Islas, lo que supone el 6% del total de parados con titulacion universitaria, que en el mes de diciembre llego a 12.431 personas. El futuro de los estudiantes de Derecho se presenta aun mas negro teniendo en cuenta que en el puesto trece de las titulaciones con mas paro esta tambien el grado en Derecho, la adaptacion de la licenciatura tras la llegada del Plan Bolonia en 2007 bajo el Gobierno de Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Por lo que sumando ambas titulaciones el numero de parados asciende a 950.
 Actualmente la materia de Derecho puede cursarse en las dos universidades publicas canarias, por lo que hay un total de 760 plazas de nuevo ingreso cada curso y la nota de corte necesaria para ser admitido no supera el seis. Aunque los datos de desempleados por titulaciones en las Islas no implican que los titulos se cursaran en los centros de Canarias.
 Por otro lado, son 709 los parados canarios que en su momento estudiaron la diplomatura de Ciencias Empresariales, y 629 los que escogieron la de Turismo. La diplomatura en Relaciones Labores y la licenciatura en Administracion y Direccion de Empresas, figuran en la cuarta y quinta posicion del ranking de titulaciones con mas paro con 518 y 421 desempleados, respectivamente.
 Psicologia es otras de las areas que menos triunfan en las entrevistas de trabajo. Hasta 387 personas con la licenciatura en este campo buscan un empleo, que unidas a las 172 que cuentan con el grado hacen un total de 559 psicologos en paro. El titulo se imparte en la Universidad de La Laguna, que cada año ofrece 250 plazas de nuevo ingreso.
 Con Trabajo Social ocurre algo similar, tanto la diplomatura como el grado estan en la lista de las veinte titulaciones con menos exito en el mercado laboral canario. En total, son 427 los trabajadores sociales sin empleo. En Canarias las dos universidades publicas ofertan estos estudios. 230 nuevos estudiantes entran cada curso en las aulas y 110 mas puede realizar sus estudios a distancia.
 Los datos indican que las peores posiciones las ocupan los titulos mas antiguos -diplomaturas y licenciaturas-, ya que solo existen tres grados entre los veinte peores puestos. El curso 2008-2009 fue el primero con la nueva ordenanza academica, por lo que fue a partir de 2012 cuando ingresaron al mercado laboral los primeros graduados. Ocho años despues las estadisticas demuestran que los jovenes lo tienen mas facil para encontrar trabajo, de los 12.431 parados con titulacion universitaria solo 516 son menores de 25 años. La mayoria, 7.486, son personas que tienen entre 25 y 45 años, y los 4.429 restantes son parados de mas de 45 años.
 La diferencia por genero tambien es notable. El 69% de los desempleados con titulacion en el Archipielago son mujeres (8.531) y el 31%, hombres (3.900). Los estudios donde predomina el numero de mujeres en paro es la licenciatura de Derecho, donde hay un total de 541 feminas, y en el caso de los hombres el titulo con menos exito es el de la diplomatura en Ciencias Empresariales, con 239 afectados.
 Los grados en Arquitectura Naval, Bioquimica, Ciencias Politicas y de la Administracion, o en Ingenieria Ambiental son algunas de las titulaciones con menos paro en las Islas.
 Los ultimos datos de desempleo en el Archipielago indican que hay un total de 208.249 parados en las Islas, por lo que los numeros siguen siendo favorables para el grupo de titulados universitarios que representan solo un 6% del total. Ademas, los ultimos datos de la Consejeria de Empleo reflejan que un 88% de los desempleados carece de estudios superiores.

National Taiwan University (NTU) and Fu Jen Catholic University are the top public and private institutions for graduate employability, a survey released on Friday by the online 1111 Job Bank (1111人力銀行) showed.
 The survey of corporate recruiters ranked NTU first among public universities, followed by National Cheng Kung University, National Chengchi University, National Tsing Hua University and National Chiao Tung University.
 Fu Jen in New Taipei City took the top rating for private institutions favored by Taiwanese employers, followed by Chung Yuan Christian University, Soochow University, Feng Chia University and Tamkang University.
 The survey, which was conducted between Oct. 16 and Nov. 20 last year, collected valid responses from 1,940 corporate executives and employers based in Taiwan.
 NTU’s placement on the list is not surprising, as it is the most prestigious and comprehensive institution in the nation, 1111 Job Bank career development and public relations head Daniel Lee (李大華) said.
 As for Fu Jen, Lee said that it is well known as one of the few private institutions with a hospital on campus, and is also one of the largest in terms of the number of colleges it has.
 However, Lee cautioned that while coming from a prestigious school could add some points to an applicant’s resume, roughly 60 percent of the recruiters polled said that allure would fade after a year.
 By that time, employers would be focused on how their recruits handled stress and work life, and judge them on their character and whether they are easy to communicate with, he added.
 At the end of the day, it is not only about the school from where a candidate has a degree, but about how competent they are on the job, Lee said.

The discovery of the Maka field in offshore Suriname will become one of the main upstream stories of 2020, bringing Suriname onto the international oil map, potentially spawning a new race for the Dutch-speaking country's still unallotted license blocks and concurrently boosting the investment potential of Guyana which will see the commissioning of Liza within a couple of months. The first-ever offshore discovery for Suriname, Apache and Total will make history in many ways. Herein below, we will take a brief look on the developments this discovery might bring about in and around Suriname - for the country itself, for its national oil company Staatsolie as well as for the companies involved in discovering the Maka field. The Maka Central-1 well encountered 73 meters 240 feet of oil pay and 50 meters 164 feet of light oil and condensate pay in Upper Cretaceous-aged intervals. Given that the Haimara field in Exxon's Stabroek Block is virtually across the border from the Maka find, one might speculate that the reserves of the new-found field will amount to a couple hundred million barrels of oil\/condensate somewhere around 200-300 MMbbls. The Maka discovery comes on the back of Total buying into Block 58 which was previously under full control of Apache, the operator of the block. Apache will drill the first three exploration wells and will transfer operatorship rights to Total thereafter. What does it mean for Suriname Suriname, despite being a tad richer on average than neighboring Guyana, was sorely missing a success story like the Maka Central-1 discovery. Suriname has recovered somewhat from the economic slump of 2016-2017, with GDP per capita in current USD growing to 6230 in 2018, yet there remains a powerful downward drag for the nation's reputation in the form of Desi Bouterse. Bouterse, convicted of drug smuggling and now also convicted of being responsible for the killing of 15 political opponents in 1982 in a case known as the December murders, a former army officer who ruled the country in the 1980s had made a spectacular comeback in 2010, winning the democratically held presidential elections. Related Bearish Sentiment Returns To Oil Markets Now Bouterse will most likely oversee the ramp-up of Suriname's offshore oil sector. This is a double-edged sword for Suriname as it might save on government squabbling and internal feuds Guyana is notoriously susceptible to this, yet simultaneously looms large on the drillers' horizons. In 2020, it might be quite difficult to explain oneself why exactly they are cooperating with a politician convicted of drug smuggling and murder, with a ruthless history of human rights violations. If the chemistry works, Suriname might see blistering economic growth by the mid-2020s - if Guyana's GDP is expected to grow 86 percent year-on-year in 2020, surely its success can be replicated by its immediate neighbor Luckily most of Suriname's offshore blocks are apportioned - ExxonMobil, Kosmos, Petronas, Tullow and Statoil have all taken up operatorships. An Exxon-led consortium comprising also Statoil and Hess Energy has won Block 59, the license area abutting Guyana Caieteur block. But perhaps even more interestingly in terms of future potential discoveries, Kosmos Energy might see its market posture improve with Block 42, located right across the Canje block and still relatively close to Guyana's Turbot\/Longtail future production hub. It has to be noted that Suriname's shallow water license areas preliminarily labelled blocks A, B, C and D are still unallotted and given that all wells drilled heretofore in a radius of some 150km from the coastline turned out to be dry, they will remain under Staatsolie for quite some time presumably. What does it mean for Staatsolie Before the Apache-Total tandem announced their Maka discovery, the national oil company Staatsolie has made public its intent to substantially expand its presence on the bond market in 2020 and also if conditions would allow to list its shares either on the London or the New York stock market. This would serve the purpose of raising some 1-2 billion to fund the Surinamese NOC's exploration drive for the upcoming years, with the company combining the double role of state oil company and oil regulator. The Maka discovery will make it easier for Staatsolie to do so as it alleviates concerns that the oil bounty in the Cretaceous plays of offshore Guyana does indeed extend into Suriname. Related U.S. Drillers Rush To Hedge Production As Oil Prices Soar The Surinamese NOC will most probably need a substantial amount of money because if early indications are not misleading enough, Staatsolie will to try to avail itself of its back-in rights, effectively allowing it to buy into proven commercial discoveries 10 or 20 percent was mooted without taking part in the exploration process. Given that Staatsolie currently operates the entirety of Suriname's upstream sector - namely two onshore fields called Calcutta and Tambaredjo with a total output of 17kbpd - the NOC will be one of hottest chips on the stock market if it manages to use back-in options wisely so as not to antagonize oil majors who bring the know-how to the country's offshore plays. What does it mean for the drillers Apache Corp's jumped 27 percent on the Maka discovery within one day - perhaps the optimistic reaction was also boosted by the speed with which ExxonMobil managed to launch Liza roughly 5 years from discovery to commissioning, certainly an example to emulate. In accordance with the shareholder's drilling schedule, Apache and Total proceeded this mid-January to the spudding of another exploration well, named Sapakara West-1 and located 20 kilometers to the southeast of Maka. Sapakara will also shed some more light on the quality to be expected in Suriname's most attractive plays - the Guyanese Liza stands at 31-32 degrees API whilst Maka tended to tilt towards densities higher than 40 degrees. In terms of political developments, domestic turmoils might slow down the pace of drilling but are unlikely to stop it - as recently as in 2017 the country saw a wave of protests on the back of IMF-suggested market reforms cutting of fuel and electricity subsidies. Staatsolie seems genuinely interested in fostering Suriname's oil sector, however it still needs to divest all its competences related to oversight of industry and following Guyana's footsteps create a comprehensive oil and gas industry regulator. But luckily the license blocks themselves are far away from the hustle and bustle of Paramaribo - and Maka will certainly motivate all relevant stakeholders to speed up the development cycle on their respective allotments.

El Grupo de Gobierno en el Ayuntamiento de Santa Cruz de La Palma ha decidido abrir una investigacion interna sobre el desarrollo del proceso de seleccion de los componentes de la Danza de Enanos de la Bajada de la Virgen de Las Nieves 2020, ante las dudas que se han planteado sobre las puntuaciones obtenidas por algunos de los candidatos.
 El gobierno municipal ha aclarado que "ante la acumulacion de reclamaciones" presentadas en el Registro de Entrada del Ayuntamiento por aspirantes a este acto lustral, "hemos entendido que lo mas conveniente y razonable es estudiar detenidamente como transcurrieron las pruebas de seleccion y comprobar fehacientemente si en las mismas pudieron existir errores o algun tipo de incidencia".
 En este sentido, PP y CC defienden que "la transparencia debe ser uno de los objetivos irrenunciables en la accion de toda administracion municipal", lo que "en el caso de las Fiestas Lustrales se debe incluso aun mas reforzar". Y es que "no queremos que haya ninguna duda sobre la eleccion de los participantes en nuestros actos mas representativos".
 El escueto comunicado de los rectores locales se adelanta a la intencion de al menos cuatro de los reclamantes de iniciar un litigio judicial en caso de no obtener respuesta a lo que entienden incumplimientos manifiestos de las bases de seleccion. Ademas, lo que incluso tendria mayor calado, la eleccion de algun candidato con menor puntuacion a otro que sin embarho no fue incluido entre los 30 mejores, tras las pruebas celebradas al efecto.
 Desde el Ayuntamiento, mas concretamente desde el gobierno local, se pretende disponer de toda la informacion, con la mayor claridad posible, antes de que las denuncias se presenten en el juzgado. Las personas que han reclamado piden al Consejo Rector de la Bajada de la Virgen que muestre publicamente el acta con la puntuacion de los seleccionados.
 Entre las alegaciones presentadas se incluyen supuestas irregularidades en las pruebas fisicas del test de Course Navette, obligatorio para todos los concursantes. En esta fase, el jurado tenia que puntuar sobre el esfuerzo realizado en un periodo maximo de 10 minutos, pero afirman que sin ningun motivo ni justificacion reglada se extendio durante dos minutos mas.
 Mas grave, en el supuesto caso de confirmarse, es que a uno de los elegidos se le puntuo con un 10 en la prueba de canto cuando ni tan siquiera llego a realizarla, siempre segun los firmantes de la impugnacion, en la que se advierte tambien de que algunos de los aspirantes se les permitio realizar las pruebas fisicas el domingo cuando todos estaban convocados para el viernes. Tampoco llegan a entender que alguien pueda ser seleccionado tras obtener buena puntuacion en la demostracion de danza, cuando supuestamente sufrio un mareo y ni tan siquiera pudo finalizarla.
 Las dudas, con o sin razon, sobre el procedimiento de seleccion comenzaron desde el mismo dia en el que el concejal responsable del acto, Elias Castro, informo de los nombres de los 30 enanos. Tuvo el error de nombrar como elegido a uno de los aspirantes que posteriormente fue excluido para meter a otro que en esa primera lista se habia quedado fuera, veredicto que estaba siendo ofrecido en directo a traves de internet y con parte de los afectados en el lugar de la deliberacion.

On further-flung islands, the Seychelles practices a “one island, one resort” policy.
 “It’s about controlling the number of tourists that come here, through controlling the number of rooms in the hotels that exist,” Seychellois Minister of Tourism, Civil Aviation, Ports and Marine Didier Dogley told reporters.
 The Seychelles has about 6,000 hotel rooms, but another 3,000 are in the pipeline, having been approved before the moratorium took effect, Dogley said.
 “We believe that we can go up to 500,000 tourists, that is just an estimate for the time being,” he said.
 Nearly half of the Seychelles’ 455km2 are classed as protected areas.
 By later this year, 30 percent of its 1.3 million square kilometers of marine territory would have protected status, too, under a special arrangement in which conservation groups agree in return to pay a small portion of Seychelles’ national debt.
 The country has two UNESCO World Heritage sites: the Mai Valley with its indigenous coco de mer palm trees and the Aldabra Atoll, home to the Seychelles’ famed giant tortoises.
 With a few exceptions — such as the popular Beau Vallon Beach on Mahe or Anse Source d’Argent on La Digue, regularly named one of the world’s most beautiful beaches — tranquility reigns on the islands. Most beachside resorts keep a low profile, blending into the jungle backdrop that reaches into the island’s interior from the white sands bordering the azure shores.
 “It all depends on the standards that you want to maintain,” said Nirmal Shah, executive director of environmental non-governmental organization Nature Seychelles.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The San Francisco 49ers are one win away from accomplishing a turnaround that's been done only once before in the Super Bowl era.
 With a victory in the NFC championship game at home on Sunday against the Green Bay Packers, the 49ers will become the second team in NFL history to make the Super Bowl a year after losing at least 12 games.
 Only the St. Louis Rams have done it, going from 4-12 in 1998 to Super Bowl champs one year later thanks in part of an injury to Trent Green that cleared the way for Kurt Warner to take over at quarterback.
 The 49ers (14-3) also can credit an injury to their quarterback for part of their turnaround; the team went only 4-12 last season after Jimmy Garoppolo went down with a season-ending knee injury in Week 3.
 The silver lining to that injury was the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, which led to the addition of defensive end Nick Bosa, who helped transform the defense into one of the league's best.
 "Things have a way of working out," Garoppolo said. "I always told myself it was a blessing in disguise, the ACL and everything, and yeah, we got Bosa out of it. That's a pretty good trade-off, I guess. Things have a way of working out, I guess. This ride is crazy. You've just got to roll with the punches."
 The Packers (14-3) have also had an impressive turnaround after slumping to a 6-9-1 record last season that led to the firing of longtime coach Mike McCarthy.
 Matt LaFleur came in and tinkered with the offense, and general manager Brian Gutekunst brought in key additions such as pass-rushing duo Preston Smith and Za'Darius Smith, who combined for 25½ sacks on the season.
 There have also been some lower-profile pickups such as Tyler Ervin, Jared Veldheer and Marcedes Lewis that have helped.
 "I think he's done a great job. I think he deserves a lot of credit, him and his staff," quarterback Aaron Rodgers said of Gutekunst. "There's been a lot of great pickups, but I think I said this at my locker a few weeks ago, the big-name ones have been fantastic, but it's kind of the other ones that have been the glue pieces, I feel like."
 These teams played earlier this season in Week 12 in what turned out to be a lopsided game. Rodgers lost a fumble on Green Bay's first possession, setting up a 2-yard TD drive that gave San Francisco the lead. The 49ers then broke it open with long TD passes to Deebo Samuel late in the second quarter and George Kittle in the third quarter for a 37-8 win. Rodgers had the worst day of his career, averaging 3.2 yards per attempt and getting sacked five times.
 San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan has a message for anyone on his team feeling overconfident.
 "Don't be that stupid because that's not real," he said. "This is about Sunday's game. I can give a thousand stories of things like that, playing games in my history I've been a part of."
 There have been 23 times in the Super Bowl era, excluding one replacement player game in 1987, that a team lost a regular-season game by at least 28 points to a team it met again in the playoffs. In nine of those cases, the team that got blown out earlier in the season came back to win in the playoffs.
 Rodgers and star receiver Davante Adams both hail from Northern California, with Rodgers growing up in Chico and Adams in Palo Alto, which is near Santa Clara. Both played college ball in the state with Rodgers going to Cal and Adams to Fresno State. But neither ended up with the 49ers, who famously passed on Rodgers with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 draft for Alex Smith.
 "I usually dreamed about playing for the 49ers as a kid, but obviously that thing passed a long time ago," Rodgers said when asked if he envisioned playing the 49ers in the playoffs.
 These two franchises that have combined for nine Super Bowl titles have a rich history when it comes to the playoffs. This will be their eighth meeting in the past 25 postseasons, three more than any other rivalry. In fact, the only other matchup to occur more often is Cowboys-Rams, which happened nine times. Green Bay has a 4-3 edge but the 49ers won the last two meetings following the 2012 and '13 seasons.
 "We've had a lot of games and had some big games in the playoffs," 49ers left tackle Joe Staley said. "Seem to find each other all the time during the regular season, as well. A team that we are familiar with and we've had a lot of great battles with throughout the years.""

China has to take responsibility for skewing the so-called “1992 consensus,” former president Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) said yesterday, adding that Beijing omitted “different interpretations” and only focused on “one China.”
 Ma made the remarks when asked about discussion within the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) following its losses in the Jan. 11 presidential and legislative elections about whether the party should improve or abandon the “1992 consensus.”
 The “1992 consensus” — a term that former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi (蘇起) in 2006 admitted making up in 2000 — refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge that there is “one China,” with each side having its own interpretation of what “China” means.
 “Both Taiwan and the Mainland have agreed to the consensus — otherwise, there would be no consensus. I think everyone misunderstands the consensus. It is, of necessity, a Taiwanese consensus and also one across the Taiwan Strait — only then would it have any effect,” Ma said yesterday.
 The “consensus” benefits Taiwan by offering it flexibility and echoing the “one China” principle as stated by the Republic of China (ROC) Constitution — both of which enable cross-strait interaction, Ma added.
 “I think the Mainland has to take certain responsibility for the misunderstanding, as it has placed too much emphasis on ‘one China’ and forgets there is the component ‘each side having its own interpretation,’” Ma said, adding that not clearing up the matter would make cross-strait relations increasingly difficult.
 In a related development, KMT Youth League head Hsiao Ching-yan (蕭敬嚴) on Friday proposed that the party should move away from pro-unification discourse.

Menard Inc. and Mayo Clinic Health System top the list of Eau Claire County's largest property taxpayers for 2019.
 Menards, after combining its multiple retail, manufacturing and corporate office properties in Eau Claire and the town of Union, ranks No. 1 with a total property tax bill of $2.85 million for 2019, according to Eau Claire County tax records.
 That's based on an estimated total assessed value of the Eau Claire-based home improvement chain's county holdings of $172.06 million.
 "We are proud we have been able to call Eau Claire home for the last half century or so that we have been in business," Menards spokesman Jeff Abbott said. "We thank the good Lord that we have been able to be prosperous enough to contribute financially to this wonderful community. We are all truly blessed to be able to live in the beautiful Chippewa Valley."
 The top 10 property taxpayers in Eau Claire County will pay a total of $11.67 million for last year, according to a top 10 list compiled by the Eau Claire County Treasurer's Office at the request of the Leader-Telegram.
 It's a list most property owners no doubt are happy they didn't make, even though they still may grumble about the size of their bill as the Jan. 31 deadline approaches for paying the first installment of 2019 property taxes.
 "The companies on this list are all major employers, they pay good wages and they have a big economic impact on the community," said Aaron White, economic development manager for the city of Eau Claire.
 The county's second-largest property taxpayer, Mayo Clinic Health System, will pay a total of $1.57 million for 2019 on taxable property assessed at $75.86 million, the county records show.
 "We take pride in supporting the communities in which our patients and employees reside," said Jason Craig, regional chair of administration for the health system's Northwest Wisconsin Region. "Additionally, as one of the largest employers in the region, our employees contribute to their respective communities through their individual tax payments."
 Mayo Clinic Health System's high ranking, combined with two other major health care providers on the list, highlights the importance of the medical sector to the local economy, White said.
 Marshfield Clinic Health System ranks fifth with a property tax bill of $1.32 million and MPT of Altoona, the holding company for OakLeaf Surgical Hospital, is seventh at $671,000.
 The county's third-ranked property taxpayer is the Gerber/Nestle manufacturing plant on the city's west side. The company faces a tax bill of $1.42 million on its property assessed at $70.37 million.
 "These are companies that are expanding, and that's positive for our tax base. It also provides a supportive story for a community that helps spur additional investment," White said, noting that prospective employers always want to know what companies are growing when evaluating potential sites in the city.
 No. 4 on the list is Oakwood Mall, the regional shopping center that opened in 1986. It has a 2019 property tax bill estimated at $1.33 million for property assessed at $65.61 million.
 Keystone Corp., formed in 1977 by Larson Cos. and Ayres Associates to develop about 900 acres in the Oakwood Hills area, lands at No. 6. The firm, which has evolved into a commercial real estate asset holding company, owns more than 25 buildings in the county, including those housing Shoppes at Oakwood, Ayres Associates, Wipfli and Red Robin.
 Rounding out the top 10 are three investment real estate companies that own multiple properties in the county: No. 8, Haymarket Concepts, which is owned by Blugold Real Estate and owns the residential portion of the Haymarket Landing building that is part of the Confluence Project; No. 9, Prairie Park Property, a holding company owned by Rooney Properties that owns its apartments in the Prairie Park development; and No. 10, Arrowhead Properties, which owns one retail building, three office buildings and 280 apartments in the county.

Biden, like most Democrats, proposes raising the cap on the level of income that is subject to the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. That cap is set at $137,700 for the current tax year, meaning any income beyond that threshold is still subject to personal income tax, but not payroll taxes. Biden -- and many other Democrats -- propose lifting that cap to increase the tax revenue flowing into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds.
