HINGHAM - Kaya Bogle wasn't accustomed to losing during his Hingham High wrestling career. But it was a loss at the Division 2 state meet on Feb. 22 that propelled him to his biggest victory.
 Bogle was leading the 132-pound finals, 5-0, with less than one minute remaining when his opponent, North Andover's Ethan Ford, pinned him in a controversial decision. Throughout the next week, Bogle used the shocking defeat as motivation for the All-States.
 "I wore the anklet I had on [in the loss] all week to put that good energy and all the hard work into the anklet," he said.
 When he reached the finals of the All-State meet, waiting for him was none other than Ford. But this time, there would be no surprise as Bogle won an 11-7 decision.
 "He got the first takedown and I was little worried, but I ended up coming back," Bogle said.
 Bogle went on to finish fourth at the New England championships, despite battling through a jammed thumb and a turf toe injury.
 "I wrestled OK [at New Englands], but I was kind of beat up from the season," he said. "I was tired and my body was sore. I feel like I wasn't healed up to wrestle to my full potential. But fourth isn't that bad for New England's."
 Comebacks were a big part of Bogle's Hingham career, which saw him go 164-23, including 43-4 in his senior season, and advance three times to the New England championships. He was also named Patriot League MVP this season after leading the Harbormen to their eighth straight league title. Bogle will head to Div. 3 Castleton (Vermont) University next fall to continue his wrestling career.
 Hingham head coach Paul Canniff calls Bogle a "funky" wrestler, which in wrestling jargon means that he didn't wrestle strictly by the book and could surprise opponents at any moment, regardless of the circumstances.
 "He was very good at getting out of situations," Canniff said. "He could go from being in trouble to putting his opponent in trouble in a second."
 Bogle calls himself a "scramble wrestler".
 "I like to do rolls and flips," he explained. "There were times when I've been down big, like 14-0 with 15 seconds left, and I've caught my guy and pinned him. You never know what's going to happen. It's unpredictable."
 Wrestling might be unpredictable, but Bogle's matches this season were as predictable as death and taxes. Alternating between competing at 132 and 138 pounds, the Harbormen could count on him for six points, for a pin, in nearly every match.
 "It's been nice to know that every time over the past four years that's pretty much what he would give us," Canniff said.
 Canniff had been waiting a long time for Bogle to pull on a Hingham uniform. "We knew he was good about 10 years ago," he said.
 Bogle's father, Damien, is a long-time youth wrestling coach in town, and Kaya began wrestling at age 5. By middle school, he was taking the sport seriously.
 "That's when I turned the corner and started wrestling year-round, and when I started to grow as a wrestler, and realized it was something I was good at, something I liked, and something I wanted to keep doing," Bogle said.

"In a 47-to-47 vote, the Senate fell short of the 60 votes that would have been needed to advance the measure, even as talks continued behind the scenes between Democrats and the White House to salvage a compromise.
