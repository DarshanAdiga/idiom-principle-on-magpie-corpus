The couple enjoyed spending time with family, attending their grandchildren's events, traveling with Susan's family, and traveling with Charlie and Pearl Hilt, especially to Hawaii. Allen was proud of his Dutch heritage and loved to talk and tell jokes. He always had a new joke for his grandkids and loved to people watch and visit at the mall while his wife and daughter shopped.

“Both road diets will make these major neighborhood street into one lane in each direction will only cause more traffic and more congestion on the Avenues but also on the surrounding blocks, it will not solve anything,” Chirico said. “Traffic needs to flow. This will only cause more trouble for ambulances and fire trucks and police vehicles stopping them from responding to emergencies. People walking have to learn to look before crossing and wait for the traffic lights to change put down the cell phones and other distractions. Making an obstacle course of these two main thoroughfares is not the way to go. Adding lines and other restrictions will only bring new dangers to the area. This has been tried in other places. It does not work and it will not work here.”
