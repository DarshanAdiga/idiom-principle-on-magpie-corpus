Now, with the BCCI set to hold the Women's Challenger tournament from November 4 to 9 at the Sharjah cricket stadium -- in all likelihood -- Shafali says she is all geared up to hit the ground running.Speaking to ANI, Shafali said it is great news for women's cricket that the challengers series -- comprising of three teams -- will happen and added that she understands the need to abide by the rules and regulations that would be put in place to ensure safety against the coronavirus."The BCCI, like every other organisation is dealing with issues because of COVID and it is understandable. The very fact that the challenger would be happening is great news and I can't wait to get back on the ground and meet the other players! Yes there will be restrictions but that's only for our safety," the 16-year-old said.The Indian women cricketers, who have been eagerly waiting for resumption of cricket, finally have a reason to smile as the Indian board will organise four women's T20 games during the playoffs of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the UAE.Throwing light on how she has been working on her game during the lockdown, the youngster said that the Haryana Cricket Association and her coach Ashwani Kumar deserve a lot of credit for keeping her in the right shape and frame of mind."The lockdown was an unforeseen situation but I looked to use it to the best of my ability and worked hard on my fitness so that I am ready to go when action resumes. The HCA has been a great strength for us in these times as we were given not just fitness charts, but even our nutritional facts were kept a check on so that as sportspersons we don't lag behind. Ashwani sir ensures that everyone follows the routine."Also, the sessions with sports psychologist helped as negativity can creep in during such times when you are stuck indoors, but the HCA ensured that we were kept motivated and knew what awaits us when normalcy returns. Ashwani sir has also always been just a call away," she said.While the women's tournament will see the best players across the globe fighting it out, those involved with the Women's Big Bash League will be missing out as the WBBL clashes with the dates of the Indian tournament.",

Samoa (up two places to 16th), Indonesia (up two places to 20th) and the United States of America (up four places to 31st) are among other teams to have made notable progress. Three teams have lost their place on the rankings table. Denmark and Belgium have not played any matches since October 2017 while Qatar have played fewer than the required six during the period. In the ODI rankings, India (121) and England (119) have lost four points each while clinging on to their second and third positions respectively. Six-time world champions and winners of both editions of the ICC Women's Championship, Australia's stellar display during the rating period saw them win 20 of 21 ODIs, increasing their tally by eight points to 160. Their massive lead of 39 points over second-placed India is the largest by any team (men or women) in any form of the game. It comes on the back of 3-0 series wins over India, Pakistan, New Zealand, England, West Indies, Sri Lanka and an earlier 2-1 victory over England in 2017. At the fourth spot is South Africa (107), who enjoy a 13-point lead over New Zealand (94), with the West Indies (85), Pakistan (77), Bangladesh (61) and Sri Lanka (47) following in that order. The latest update expunges results from the 2016-17 season, weights the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons at 50 per cent and the 2019-20 matches at 100 percent.",
