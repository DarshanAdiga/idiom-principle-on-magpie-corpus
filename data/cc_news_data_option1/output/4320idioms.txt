And to place judgement on that person because they might have been a felon would skew our opportunity to perhaps find a very good employee. So rather than trying to judge and say, "Oh, this person has done this or that," we have a process that once people are on board, if they can demonstrate they're going to be a good employee and they can join and be effective with the other 99 team members, then we're happy to have them.

The global spread of coronavirus and the resulting lockdowns in early 2020 affected Seagate’s manufacturing activity, but the company made a strong comeback to post full-year 2020 revenue of $10.51 billion, up from $10.39 billion in 2019. EPS came in at $3.83 in 2020 vs $7.13 in 2019, down 46%, but a closer look reveals that operating margins in fact dropped from 14.3% in 2019 to 12.4% in 2020, a decrease of 13%, less than a third of the drop in EPS. EPS dropped primarily due to a tax expense of $28 million in 2020, compared to a tax benefit of $640 million in 2019.

Kyle Flanagan confirmed his departure from the Sydney Roosters with the halfback expected to sign a long-term NRL deal with Canterbury.
 The 22-year-old took to Instagram on Monday to announce he was leaving the Roosters just one season into a two-year deal.
 "Shocked and Disappointed," Flanagan wrote.
 "I want to thank everyone involved with my time at the @sydneyroosters.
 "A rollercoaster year but full of memories I'll remember forever.
 "To the fans, I appreciate the ongoing support, it's been unreal. To the lads, I loved every minute with you boys."
 Flanagan, who joined the Roosters from Cronulla last year as a replacement for the retired Cooper Cronk, paid the price after the back-to-back premiers were ousted from this year's finals by Canberra.
 He played 20 games this year but was dropped by coach Trent Robinson during the campaign to work on his development.
 Robinson will look towards Lachlan Lam and Sam Walker to press for the No.7 jersey in 2021 with Flanagan's exit alleviating some salary cap pressure.
 New Bulldogs coach Trent Barrett is widely tipped to take goal-kicking Flanagan to Belmore after they released veteran playmaker Kieran Foran, who has since returned to Manly.

 Oct 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A proposal by a private club to cordon off a section of Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach has divided local residents and sparked a debate on changes to public spaces in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Amalfi Beach Club, in a petition posted online earlier this month, proposed paid access to individual cabanas or tents on part of Australia's popular beach to meet rules on social distancing and group sizes, from the months of February to May.
 The move would help create jobs and support the local economy, said Janek Gazecki, a producer at the Amalfi Beach Club. The petition, addressed to the local Waverley Council, has garnered about 1,000 signatures.
 "Our proposal is not to privatise the beach, or make it exclusive for the wealthy. It utilises existing leasing mechanisms for use of public land - absolutely anyone can go online and book a space," he said in response to criticism.
 "It attracts tourism at a time when it is significantly down at Bondi Beach. It is an ideal way to raise morale and boost the local economy during a recession," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.
 Waverley Council said it was examining the proposal.
 "While as a matter of principle, the regulatory and policy settings are geared towards beaches and open spaces being there to be enjoyed freely by everyone, this proposal needs to be properly assessed against those laws and policies," Mayor Paula Masselos said in the statement.
 "While there are various views on the proposal, anyone has the right to submit a proposal," she said, adding that there would be a period of community consultation.
 With some cities easing lockdown restrictions, tempers have flared over use of public spaces, as authorities have handed pavement space to restaurants in need of outdoor seating, and limited visitors to parks and beaches.
 In Sydney, while many social media users welcomed the idea of a beach club with paid access, others slammed the proposal.
 "This is disgusting, elitist and a horrible precedent to set. The beach should stay open and accessible to all," Manion Harry wrote on the club's Facebook post.
 Public beaches are a particularly contentious issue, as hotels and private properties worldwide lock horns with locals over access.
 As enclaves for the wealthy become popular on the back of the coronavirus, there will "undoubtedly" be some changes to use of space, said Tony Matthews, a senior lecturer in urban and environmental planning at Australia's Griffith University.
 "For example, many restaurants are primarily serving customers in outdoor seating. But pavements exist primarily for pedestrians, so there will always be a practical limit to how much can be used for dining," he said.
 "Australian beaches are considered to be open to all, egalitarian and fundamental to social life. Privatising sections of them for any purpose is unlikely to garner significant community or council support," he said. (Reporting by Rina Chandran in Bangkok @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

If you do the right thing and yield to your fellow driver and allow them to merge safely in front of you, do they give you the wave? That's the key. No wave, no common courtesy-equals horrible person. I know that sounds trite, but I would bet my bottom dollar that the person who feels entitled and doesn't have the courtesy to give you the wave-in other words say thank you—is probably not the nicest person in the world. Probably the same person who would park their car and take up two parking spaces, especially in a crowded city where parking spaces are scarce to begin with. It's quite offensive in my opinion. And where I grew up, repeat offenders would get their tires slashed. Not the best form of justice and I don't condone it, but sometimes that's what it takes to turn on the little light bulb.

 It was the party of the year, maybe the decade, and a grand civic event that its boosters hoped would be held annually in the years to come.
   
 "From every town within a radius of 150 miles of Augusta, they poured into the city and were entertained by one of the most elaborate programs ever arranged in the South," The Chronicle reported. "Mardi Gras could not be mentioned in the same breath as Jollification Week."
   
 There were parades, dances, concerts, tight-rope walkers, singers ... and all the commerce that went with them. "Often it was impossible to move one way or the other on Broad Street," the newspaper said. The week (mostly three days) ended with an outdoor ball around the 900 and 1000 blocks of Broad that lasted until a late (or early) hour.
   
 It seemed like a stunning success ... but was never mentioned, nor held again.

According to Solender, the study also looked at the effects of ads on more competitive races. “Negative advertising from PACs and super PACs plays a limited role in competitive senatorial races,” the study found, because “heightened media attention results in a more informed and engaged electorate and therefore a greater likelihood that voters utilize more detailed, central route processing.” In other words, the more voters already know about the candidate, the less they need to learn from ads.
 Take the most extreme example. In the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were universally known to voters and were the subjects of wall-to-wall coverage on all levels of news. For that reason, according to Lewis, “You could’ve given Hillary Clinton another billion dollars and it wouldn’t have made a difference, because at that point there’s so much media coverage and the candidates are so well known that it’s complete overkill.” This is not necessarily the case in a race like a non-competitive Senate election or a House race. “Advertising is more impactful as you go down the pecking order,” he said.

Our city, prior to that day, was relatively peaceful, the crime rate was down, the people were getting along, but trust me when I say this, there wasn't a sense of civility here. We had plenty of homeless people, for whom there wasn't much help; racism was alive and well; and the police were becoming more and more aggressive. Rest assured, if you needed help, chances are everyone was just too busy. There wasn't much common courtesy happening. But after 911, there was a sense of brotherhood and civility like I had never seen or felt before in my entire life. Like night and day.

In realtà non è un'affermazione comica, bensì la base di un istinto di sopravvivenza differente, al quale si aggiunge la risposta che hanno provato a trovare due ricercatori della University of Alabama at Birmingham, con uno studio poi pubblicato sulla rivista Cell metabolism. Il segreto sarebbe frutto dell'unione di più elementi: genetica, stile di vita, proteine e capacità di sopravvivenza, dove il primo aspetto parla da sé, gli ultimi due riguardano rispettivamente la FoxP2, detta «proteina del linguaggio» più abbondante nel cervello delle donne, e la resilienza femminile. Ma lo stile di vita è, sicuramente l'aspetto più significativo. Le donne, infatti, sono tendenzialmente più salutiste degli uomini, mangiano meno e meglio, consumano meno alcol e fumano meno.

Put down the pencils. Hang the costumes in the closet. And put the blade covers back on the skates.
 Lest anyone forget, the cororavirus is giving Massachusetts a not-so-gentle reminder that it never really left.
 Boston was the latest community to pull back on in-person learning, as Hub schools went completely remote with transmission of the coronavirus continuing to increase in the city.
 Boston's exit from the classroom earned the city a mention on the presidential debate stage Thursday night where President Donald Trump continued to insist the country had turned a corner in its fight against the virus. Gov. Charlie Baker hasn't gone that far -- and doesn't agree with the president on much these days -- but on the issue of schools the two Republicans seem to be reading from the same page.
 Baker said he wouldn't "Monday morning quarterback" Mayor Marty Walsh's decision for Boston, but said again that it's not schools where the virus is spreading. Instead, the governor continued to blame social gatherings, primarily of 19- to 39-year-olds, where masks are not being worn and distancing not observed.
 It's not all retreat
 In Massachusetts, the daily new case count almost reached 1,000 on Thursday and the seven-day weighted average positive test rate ticked up to 1.5% as 77 cities and towns are now in the state's highest-risk "red" category.
 In MetroWest, Ashland joined Framingham, Marlborough, Milford, Holliston, Hudson and Southborough as a red community.
 On Thursday night, the Department of Public Health decided to shut down ice skating rinks due to clusters of infections the state has observed linked to hockey games, practices and tournaments.
 The state, however, is far from being in retreat.
 In fact, Baker this week called attention to what his administration described as an ongoing $775 million economic stimulus program that included $115 million in just available funding, the highlight of which was a new $50.8 million grant program for hard hit small businesses.
 "To be clear, there's no substitute for the size and scope that a federal aid package could deliver. But that doesn't seem to be in the offing and we certainly don't believe that we can wait," Baker said
 Other things red
 With less than two weeks until voting ends in Massachusetts, more than a quarter of the state's 4.6 million registered voters have already cast their ballots. Of the 1.3 million votes cast, almost 890,000 have been by mail, with the rest of the voters turning up in person since early voting opened on Oct. 17.
 So for a good chunk of the electorate, Baker was too late when he endorsed Republican Kevin O'Connor in the Dover attorney's longshot race against U.S. Sen. Edward Markey. In a hand-held cellphone video, Baker said O'Connor would bring "feet-on-the-ground" representation to Washington.
 But the O'Connor endorsement was perhaps more notable for the fact that Baker chose to back another Republican for Senate, along with Susan Collins of Maine. If O'Connor were to win, the odds of the GOP retaining control of the U.S. Senate increase greatly, although it can't be assumed that's what Baker wants, even if he is trying to shore up his right flank.
 The governor has been frustrated with both parties in Washington, but particularly his own. He has criticized Congress' inability to get a stimulus deal done, and disagrees with the decision of Republicans to press forward with the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
 And, of course, he is not voting for President Donald Trump for re-election.
 Meet the chief
 Framingham Mayor Yvonne Spicer is moderating a Zoom meeting at 5 p.m. Monday in which the community is invited to learn more about the two finalists for police chief.
 One is surely a familiar face -- Deputy Police Chief Lester Baker, who's been on the force since 2003. And the other might be, at least for some. He's James Rhoden Jr., major/commander of the Baltimore Police Department -- the same James Rhoden who was selected to replace Thomas O'Loughlin as Milford's police chief earlier this year.
 Rhoden declined the offer, saying it was best for his family to remain in Baltimore.
 For Monday's Zoom session, each candidate will be given equal time to provide an overview of his vision for the Framingham Police Department and answer questions from the community.
 To participate in Monday's Zoom session, visit framinghamma.gov/calendar.
 Those who cannot attend but have questions are asked to email kmcfalls@framinghamma.gov with the subject line: "October 26, Framingham Police Chief Candidate Zoom." A recording of the meeting will be provided to everybody who emails a question(s).
 Twenty-one people initially applied to replace Steven Trask, who retired in June. Ron Brandolini has served as acting chief since then, but did not apply for the permanent job.

PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- Four centuries after white Europeans stepped off the Mayflower and onto America's shores, some descendants of the colonists are wrestling with the complicated legacy of their ancestors amid a global racial reckoning.
 There is immense pride among those who can trace their families back to the passengers who boarded the ship in Plymouth, England, in 1620 to flee religious persecution and realize a better life. Yet for some, the devastating impact that the Pilgrims' landing in New England had on Native Americans weighs heavily in this moment of unrest over systemic racism.
 In interviews with The Associated Press, Americans and Britons who can trace their ancestry either to the Pilgrims or the indigenous people who helped them survive talked openly about the need in 2020 to fairly tell the history.
 "Considering my ancestors helped incite the racial hierarchies that caused the need for these movements now, I do feel ashamed that that had to be part of history," said Olivia Musoke, 19, whose ancestor on her mother's side arrived in America on the Mayflower.
 Musoke, whose father is Black, said the pride she feels in coming from people who helped settle this country "gets diminished by the role they played in kind of manipulating and terrorizing people of color, which trickled down to the structures we have today."
 For some, it's a difficult issue to reconcile.
 "The pilgrims came out of religious persecution in England. And I'm very proud of the fact that they set off to create their own independent culture," said Seth Howland Handy, 53, another descendant of a Mayflower passenger. "But they came to a place where there was existing culture. And, you know, the history is not friendly and that is troublesome," he said.
 Handy said it's more important now than ever now to "recognize everyone's role in our history and the great diversity of this country." The U.S. was embroiled in civil unrest this summer, with protesters demanding justice for George Floyd and other Black Americans killed or injured by police.
 Ginny Mucciacco, a descendant of Mayflower passenger Degory Priest, said the Pilgrims' work ethic was admirable.
 "To have this tie to our early history is really, I won't say it's a privilege, an honor. But it's just something to be proud of because so many of them worked so hard, for so many years to help establish this country. And it's just very important to me," said Mucciacco, 90, of Dedham, Massachusetts.
 The soul-searching extends across the Atlantic to England, where Mayflower descendants say they, too, are trying to reconcile pride and prejudice.
 Vicky Cosstick, a Briton whose ancestors John Alden and Priscilla Mullins were passengers, said she's troubled by the suffering the indigenous people endured -- but she doesn't feel guilt.
 "I'm of course horrified and appalled to know what happened as a result of British colonialism in America and what happened to their Native American tribes and the Wampanoags," Cosstick said.
 "It's not as if they went to America in order to steal land from an indigenous population," she said. "Much of it was clearly wrong, but there are many stories that need to be told. And I think the anniversary gives a chance for all of those stories to be told."
 As the racial reckoning has brought new scrutiny to how African American history is taught in American schools, Native Americans have long pushed for the unvarnished stories of their ancestors to be heard.
 When the Pilgrims arrived at what we now know as Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Wampanoag tribe helped the exhausted settlers survive their first winter. But Native Americans also endured racism, oppression and new diseases brought by the European settlers.
 "We were exposed to disease. We were exposed to slavery. I mean, what happened here was people who came not just for religion -- that might have been their purpose of leaving their homeland -- but they came here and wanted to wipe out the existence of a whole culture," said Hazel Harding Currence, 78, of the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe of Cape Cod.
 Organizers of the events planned for this year to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower's arrival pledged to amplify the voices of the Wampanoag, which have been marginalized in past years. Fifty years ago, state officials disinvited a leader of the Wampanoag Nation to the commemoration after learning his speech would bemoan the tribe's suffering.
 This year, many anniversary events were canceled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We should have never been treated the way that we were, our ancestors," Currence said. "I think that if they were here now, if they were looking down on us, I think they'd be very proud at the movement that's going forward now."
 Even though the virus has put a damper on the commemoration, some members of the Wampanoag tribe say they're hopeful that the attention on the problem of systemic racism this year will help their voices and stories be heard in a way they haven't been before.
 "It's opening up everyone else's eyes to how unbalanced the world is and unequal," said Troy Currence, Hazel Harding Currence's son and a medicine man from the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe.
 "The world is spinning out of control. So I think more people are going to be aware and more sensitive and open to receiving a message like that," he said.

This November, Washington state voters have the opportunity to reform the current approach to sex education in Washington state public schools. Senate Bill 5395 was passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. Jay Inslee in March, but became Referendum 90 when opponents of the bill gathered enough signatures to put it on the ballot for Washington voters to have a final say. Despite this pushback, many feel this measure may be the answer we need to realize safer college campuses for future generations of young adults.
 Referendum 90 would require “school districts to adopt or develop, consistent with state standards, comprehensive age-appropriate sexual health education, as defined, for all students, and excuse students if their parents request,” for students in grades K-12. The referendum gives school districts the option to provide this type of education; however, this measure would ensure that all students would have access to “medically and scientifically accurate” sexual health education that they are in need of.

 # DAVID MURDOCK COLUMN: On dialect and pronunciation
 David Murdock, Special to The Times
 Looking back at nearly 15 years of columns, I’ve noticed trends. One of the major trends is that my “style” of writing these columns has changed over the years — the earlier ones are more formal, more “correct.” As my frequency of writing changed from an occasional column to a twice-a-month column to a weekly one, the style and tone became markedly less formal and more “folksy,” for lack of a better word. Or, to put it more accurately — the style and tone changed to one that more closely matches my everyday speaking voice.
 This trend has been brought to my attention on multiple occasions, but three of them truly stand out. I’ve mentioned the first two before. First, the famous “lost column.” In all these years of writing columns for The Gadsden Times, only one has ever been rejected. What cracks me up about it was the reason given — “it doesn’t sound like you.” At the time, that column really did sound like me ... the “academic” me. It was quite formal in style and tone, and it dealt with an “academic” subject matter.
 The next time that the change was brought to my attention was one of my favorite compliments that I’ve ever received. The mother of one of my childhood friends said that the column “sounds” just like I talk. That one really meant a lot to me and still does. Honestly, I don’t sit down to write and plan how to make my writing sound like my speaking; it just happens now.
 And that brings me to the third time, which came in an email from another childhood friend after the column on Sprott, Alabama, a few weeks ago. I got quite a few comments on that column, but no one commented on the line that I labored the most over, which was the first one — “Well, I’ve done been all to Sprott — Sprott, Alabama, that is.” Obviously, that line is just an offense to formal grammar. My several re-writes of the line concerned how far I could push being “incorrect” formally and “correct” in terms of how I actually would have said it in conversation. My first draft of the line was “Well, I done went all to Sprott ...” — a draft that I still like the best, frankly. It’s exactly how I would say it, if I were talking to friends and family. Still, I thought “I” would have been thought a typing error instead of a conscious choice, so I wrote it instead as “I’ve.” Of course, “I’ve done went all to Sprott ...” then becomes REALLY incorrect, so I had to change the “went.” Normally, I would have written “gone,” but that just didn’t “sound right,” so it became “been.”
 My friend who emailed drew attention to another phrase in that column, where I had written “I’d’ve” — there was no way that I was going to write, “I would have” in that context. That sounds far too grand, but I did think about “I’d’ve” before I typed it. Anyone who shares my particular dialect would have gotten it immediately, as my friend did. Anyone who doesn’t share my dialect would have thought of it as ... well ... “dialect.”
 The thing about “I’d’ve,” though, is not how one writes it, but how one says it. In my mind, it’s pronounced “Eye dove.” We almost never think of how our dialect is actually pronounced and usually don’t notice it until it’s pointed out. I never knew, for example, that Southerners generally have one pronunciation for the words “pin” and “pen” until my voice and diction professor pointed it out to me. Up North, “pen” is pronounced differently, almost like “pehn.” I honestly didn’t know there was a difference. Although I’ve tried, I cannot quite get my tongue to make the sound of it as Northerners pronounce it.
 And it’s not just North and South — there are possibly four different dialects in Alabama alone, depending on which linguist is classifying. Here, we speak Southern Midland Appalachian — the usual term for it. My mother, however, was born in Camden, Alabama — which is not far from Sprott, actually — and her dialect is usually termed “Deep Southern.”
 I never really noticed how differently Mother pronounced some words until I developed an ear for it. Her name was Flora, and she pronounced it just a little bit differently than we do. In Northeast Alabama, we usually say “Floor-rah.” She usually said “Flow-ruh.” It was subtle, but it was there. Not only did her pronunciation of words differ slightly, but sometimes she had words that no one up here used at all. For example, she called sweater vests “wes-ketts.” It took me years to realize that that was how she said “waistcoat,” and it’s the absolutely correct pronunciation for the absolutely correct word for a man’s vest. We just don’t much use the word here.
 There’s always a bit of danger in trying to reproduce a spoken dialect in written form. That’s why I don’t attempt to reproduce the actual pronunciations, even when I’m rendering my own dialect. It’s difficult enough to turn off the “formal” — that way we’ve been taught to write — and turn on the “actual.”

ANDOVER, KANSAS - The Andover Trojans fell to the Newton Railers in three sets in a tough sub-state Championship on Saturday at Andover Central High School, ending their season.
   
 The Trojans, who dealt with injuries and an influx of youth after going to the state tournament each of the last four seasons finally saw their run end but not without hope for the future.
   
 "We still have a lot of youth," Andover head coach Holly Avalos said. "I think half our roster will be returning next year."
   
 Andover took care of fourth seeded Emporia in straight sets to set up the eventual loss to Newton, the sub-state's second seeded team.
   
 "We lost to them on Tuesday," Avalos said. "We knew would have to be ready in this one."
   
 Newton wasted little time putting the Trojans on their heels, jump up early in the first set 5-1 before Andover finally was able to grab their bearings.
   
 After dropping the first set 25-22, the Trojans responded in the second set when Caleigh Haetten had three straight service points to give them the lead for the first time in the set.
   
 After an Andover timeout, they would push out on an 8-2 run, giving them a 20-16 lead and would eventually close out the set 25-20, setting up the decisive third set.
   
 Newton jumped on Andover early in the third set, going up 13-6, mainly off the service of freshman libero, Abigail Koontz.
   
 Andover made a push, fighting back on six straight points and eventually took the lead 21-20, forcing a Newton into a timeout.
   
 Newton came out and set up an Asha Regier on a kill and then after Andover had been hitting soft shots to steal points, Newton adjusted and made the Trojans pay.
   
 "Credit to Newton who adjusted at the right time," Avalos said.
   
 Though the season is over, they will return seven players off a team that went 25-6 this season.
   
 "We went through a lot this season and they never quit," Avalos said. "I'm proud of them."

“I called out Tommy Fury and KSI before, and was a bit frustrated they were leaving me out, because I’d have fought both of them! I’d definitely still fight them, Tommy Fury has got a bit of something about him, boxing’s a business and I could sell a lot of tickets for that one! On that note, I want to thank all my supporters. I do have a few tickets left if anyone wants them, but my fans never let me down. They’ve continued to support me during the lockdown and I can’t ask any more of them, they’ve been brilliant.”

Where he took that though hit me like a truck. He proclaims the politicians do not want us to vote. They do not want us to have a voice or an opinion, claiming they thrive on the current situation of watching the lower classes fight over the last crumb in a hope to eliminate the masses in so many ways. I have constantly mistaken the concept of vote for me campaigning after I hear this, but realize it plays into common messaging I have portrayed as of recently. The campaign trails are filled why not the other candidate. The slippery slope to the slander political game that has gained momentum over the years. The main message is the other candidate is the reason for blame to a certain group of people’s woes. The media agenda’s echo that hoping that they can portray the other side so negatively that the citizen has no choice but to vote for the lessor portrayed evil.

The substance added to my core feelings and views, but where he really aligned to me as this topic came to close was the concept of then what. The problem is we only see the perception of importance as we near election time to express desires. This is our chance, as a new generation comes to the polls to express their views for the country, to answer “so what?” It is time to hold the winner accountable. It is time to push the notion that we as a people put you in a position of power to execute our desires for a better country. Easier said than done, I assure that, but the push for changes we put someone in office for needs to be relentless beginning November 4th in a rage to hold someone accountable for the direction we go in this country. The key is to vote, but that vote means nothing if we do not hold our elected officials accountable.

I’ll take it as it goes in there though, depending on what he brings, I’ll adapt accordingly. I won’t be going out there disrespecting him, he’s got a good chin, and I respect anyone who’s in the other corner, but if I see the opportunity it would be nice to do something Dillian couldn’t and stop him.
