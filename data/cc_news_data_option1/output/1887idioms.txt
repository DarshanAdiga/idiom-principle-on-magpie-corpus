A plan to finally pull the plug on the 2020 legislative session due to the virus pandemic is now up in the air. Senate President Karen Fann said Thursday she has more than enough votes among Republican and Democratic lawmakers to formally wrap up the session that has been in recess since March 23. But the plan changed late Thursday and the status of the session is now up in the air. Fann and other lawmakers say safety during the virus outbreak means the session should end, but other lawmakers say there's too much left to do.

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — Michigan officials have called off the annual Labor Day walk across the Mackinac Bridge, the latest of many summer traditions in the state to be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Mackinac Bridge Authority said it determined that the walk — which typically draws tens of thousands of participants to the bridge linking Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas — posed too great a health risk. “We can’t in good conscience continue with an event we know draws people from across our state and beyond, and puts them shoulder-to-shoulder for hours, when medical advice strenuously advises against such gatherings,” said Patrick Gleason, chairman of the panel. The nearly 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long) suspension bridge traverses the Straits of Mackinac, which connects Lake Huron and Michigan. It is closed to pedestrians except on Labor Day, when people are allowed to stroll across the span. It's a big economic boost for Mackinaw City and St. Ignace, the tourism-oriented towns on either side of the bridge. Restaurants, souvenir shops, campgrounds and other businesses are packed on the weekend leading up to the walk, which dates to 1958, the year after the bridge opened to traffic. Members of the public voiced support and opposition to canceling the event during an online meeting of the bridge authority Wednesday. Toll revenues from motorist crossings have slumped in recent months, leaving less money available to cover the $300,000 in expenses that the walk generates, said Matt McLogan, the panel's vice chairman and head of its finance committee. “The walk is a wonderful tradition, which I have consistently supported. But the MBA must hold the line on expenses wherever it can now because we don’t know when or if regular...

Frightened laypersons aren’t the only targets of claims for cellular treatments for COVID-19. So are decision-makers and government regulators.
 The FDA came under fire in March when it issued an “emergency use authorization” to allow the prescribing of two antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for COVID-19 patients. The action came after President Trump had been relentlessly promoting the drugs as potential “game changers” in the battle against COVID-19.
 Less than a month later, the FDA issued a warning against using the drugs against COVID-19 because of reports of serious heart problems in COVID-19 patients who had taken them, as well as the absence of evidence that they were safe and effective for treating the disease.
 It wouldn’t be surprising to see more companies and clinics showing up in the media and on cable television hawking unsubstantiated stem cell treatments for COVID-19. On May 4, the San Diego stem cell firm Giostar issued a news release asserting that it had received “approval for a COVID-19 clinical trial...using stem cells to treat COVID-19 patients, under the approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ‘expanded access for compassionate use’ program.”

The more than two months that passed before the McMichaels were arrested and the fact that it didn't happen until after the video of the shooting became public caused many to draw parallels to other shootings of black men by white men in recent years.
 “While the death of Ahmaud Arbery is a tragedy, causing deep grief to his family — a tragedy that at first appears to many to fit into a terrible pattern in American life — this case does not fit that pattern. The full story, to be revealed in time, will tell the truth about this case,” Frank Hogue said.
 According to an incident report by Glynn County police, Gregory McMichael, said he and his son armed themselves and chased Arbery in a pickup truck after seeing him run down their street. Gregory McMichael told police he suspected Arbery was a burglar, and said he attacked Travis McMichael before he was shot in a struggle over the gun.
 Separately, lawyers for Arbery's family said in a statement released Wednesday evening that the family is interested in talking to an anonymous person who they say left a poignant, heartfelt note at the site of Arbery's death.
 “They feel great sympathy for the person who wrote that note and would like to speak with them to determine what they knew or what they saw,” the attorneys wrote. “If that person would like to confidentially come forward and communicate with the family, they can contact the legal team or reach out directly to Mr. Arbery’s family."
 Arbery's mother said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday that she has confidence in the investigation now that the GBI has taken it over from local police and the Cobb County district attorney has been called in as an independent prosecutor to handle it. She said she would like prosecutors to seek the death penalty.

This pandemic is teaching us quite a bit about ourselves.
 For instance, my husband and I have collectively decided I'm too much of an anxious disaster to shop at the supermarket.
 This was never previously the case. I always did the grocery shopping and often went to the store 2-3 times each week, in addition to my weekend haul, to pick up items I forgot or needed for some dish I was whipping up that night. On any given Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday night, I'd stop at the store on my way home from work, just to pick up 3 or 4 items. Six bags and $120 later, I'd roll my loaded carriage out of there, head home and get cooking.
 COVID-19 has changed all of that.
 There's no more stopping by the store several times a week for a few missing ingredients, now missing from the shelves anyway. It's a once-a-week (or every two weeks) trip, following a carefully crafted, long and detailed list, seeking things you are resigned at the outset, you probably won't find. There's no quick in and out to pick up a couple items you previously forgot; it's a 2-plus-hour odyssey, fraught with fear, uncertainty and disappointment. My supermarket forays early on in the pandemic provide ample reason for being relieved of my shopping duties.
 In my heightened state of agitation and fervent desire to race through the store in a manic, $500-shopping-spree style and get the heck out into the fresh air and perceived safety of the parking lot, I've had difficulty focusing on and following social distancing guidelines.
 For instance, I didn't immediately notice the blue arrows taped on the floor of the produce section as I raced from the bananas to the basil and then back again to the plum tomatoes.
 "There are arrows on the floor showing the way you're supposed to go; you need to be following the arrows!" my husband "helpfully" points out.
 Mouth agape behind my blue pollen mask, I look down at the floor, and then back up at my husband with eyes astonished and ashamed. Trying to slow my rapid breathing as I search for the reduced fat pesto sauce in the refrigerated pasta display, I realize at the very same moment my husband notes aloud, that I'm touching too many things.
 "You're touching too many things! Why are you touching everything?!"
 Dropping the full-fat pesto sauce back on the shelf, I walk away empty handed and refrain from making any explanation. Now fixated on the arrows on the floor I make my way down the new one-way aisles distractedly and barely looking at the list I painstakingly penned.
 I've forgotten that I needed sesame seeds back in the baking aisle, which is one-way the other direction. And while I can see them amid the colorful array of spices from the end cap of the adjacent aisle, and by taking just a few steps could reach out and grab the plastic jar; I know I should not and must not go the wrong way, against the arrows and all that is right and lawful in a supermarket during a pandemic.
 With sesame seeds retrieved after another lap down and around to the baking aisle, it's time to roll toward the registers. More tape lines on the floor indicate how far we can stand from other shoppers in front of us. The exit is in sight and I'm eager to get out of the store, rip off my mask and exhale.
 "Is it hot in here or is it me?"
 It's hot.
 As we edge toward the conveyor belt, I pull out an envelope of clipped coupons. Flipping through is no easy task with sweaty palms in oversized latex gloves, so I toss them back into my purse.
 And just like that, I'm over the line; the shopper ahead of us is still completing her transaction at the pin pad.
 "Six feet, Alice! You're not social distancing!" I'm urgently reminded.
 I apologize to the shopper, the cashier ringing us up and the bagger bagging our groceries. I fumble in my wallet for my credit card, immediately snagging several fingers of my latex gloves in the zipper.
 I want to scream into my mask and run out of the store, but instead I hold out my gloved hand to my husband, the wallet dangling from the thumb and index finger and quietly plead, "Help me."
 And he has, by doing all the food shopping ever since, as I keep my social distance from the supermarket.

A popular Iowa college town offers visitors a peaceful, quiet visit with interesting things to do and great pizza.      Grinnell is home to Grinnell College, which adds to the comfortable and inviting feel of this city of just over 9,000 residents. It is a place where visitors can walk the streets, shop, eat and enjoy the friendly, laid-back atmosphere.      Grinnell is known as the Jewel of the Prairie, as it is loaded with some of Iowa's best independent restaurants and unique shops. It has been named as one of the Top Ten Coolest Small Towns in America by travel journalists.      History   A visit must include spending some time admiring the Merchants' National Bank building, one of the eight Midwestern "jewel box" banks designed by Louis Sullivan, an architecture legend and mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright.      The jewel box banks are made of brick. For the Grinnell bank, Sullivan chose a variety of brick colors, giving the 1914 building a reddish-brown appearance. The building has a jewel box or strongbox look with an ornamental interior and cathedral-like exterior.      The building is open to the public. It is currently the Grinnell Area Chamber of Commerce and visitors center. It is open year-round Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call ahead for a weekend visit. Docents are often available to answer questions. For more information call 641-236-6555.      Art   Grinnell thrives in arts and culture. The Grinnell College Museum of Art, formerly known as the Faulconer Gallery, is in the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts and is worth a stop. The museum offers major exhibits from international and national artists. The museum encompasses a print and drawing study room that offers students and faculty a place to see original works on paper from the museum's collection, including some by Pablo Picasso and Rembrandt van Rijn. The museum has more than 6,000 items.      It is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday except for major holidays, but is currently closed due to the pandemic. Check the website for opening information or contact wrightl@grinnell.edu. The museum is also offering virtual tours and information from the artists at grinnell.edu/campus-life/arts-culture/museum.      Unique stay   There were probably times, as a student, you might have fallen asleep in class, but this unique, fun hotel offers visitors a chance to sleep in a classroom and not get in trouble.      Hotel Grinnell is a 1921 former junior high building with a variety of modern hotel rooms. Although the rooms are modern, they are also retro, and the design incorporates school items such as benches and the original hardwood floors. Rooms, in general, are half classroom and proved to be quiet and peaceful.      The hotel uses a bit of humor. An example is the necktie visitors hang on the door to not be disturbed. Rooms are not all the same as the former locker rooms are now bunk rooms. Each room also has a chalkboard. One of guests' favorite amenities are the complimentary bikes to get around town.      Different artwork is displayed in each room. The halls have been kept looking like a school, yet with a comfortable setting of a modern hotel.      The Periodic Table bar takes on a gymnasium look with an operating scoreboard on the wall. Owner-Operator Angela Harrington said the bar specializes in craft cocktails and mocktails. They have suspended food service at this time to encourage guests to dine around town.      The hotel is currently open with touchless check-in and has suspended daily cleaning services to minimize the exposure to others of each room. However, there are always housekeeping services available when needed. Visit hotelgrinnell.com for more information.      Pizza   There are a variety of great restaurants in Grinnell, and one that pizza seekers stand in line for is Pagliai's, known for their fresh made dough. They have been serving up pies since 1957. They also offer made from scratch dishes passed down from generation to generation. It won't disappoint and is within walking distance of Hotel Grinnell. Visit pagliaisgrinnellia.com for hours and new on when dine-in reopens.      Grinnell is a gem of a town located between Des Moines and Iowa City. It is well worth the short venture off I-80 to enjoy a day, a weekend, or to kick back for a few days and enjoy a peaceful walkable community adventure.      If you travel soon, make sure to check online or with the places you plan to visit to see if they are open, or have new hours, etc.

La portata della pandemia ha dato un notevole impulso alla ricerca su questo nuovo virus. Il suo genoma è stato sequenziato a tempo di record e l'11 gennaio le autorità cinesi hanno messo i dati a disposizione dei ricercatori di tutto il mondo. Molti laboratori hanno spostato le loro priorità per permettere a gruppi di ricercatori di lavorare sul SARS-CoV-2. Per fare questo, hanno potuto sfruttare le tecnologie sviluppate nel 2003 durante l'epidemia di SARS, un coronavirus “cugino” di quello che ha appena provocato una battuta d'arresto in tutto il mondo.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly eight years after he was last on the ballot, Barack Obama is emerging as a central figure in the 2020 presidential election.
 Democrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president. Obama remains the party’s most popular figure, particularly with black voters and younger Democrats, and Biden’s presidential campaign is planning for him to have a highly visible role in the months to come.
 For President Donald Trump, that means an opportunity to focus the spotlight on one of his favorite political foils. In recent days, Trump and his allies have aggressively pushed conspiracy theories about Obama designed to fire up the president’s conservative base, taint Biden by association and distract from the glut of grim health and economic news from the coronavirus pandemic.
 “Partisans on both sides want to make this about Obama,” said Ned Price, who served as spokesperson for Obama’s White House National Security Council.
 The renewed political focus on Obama sets the stage for an election about the nation’s future that will also be about its past. As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he’s also running to restore some of the former president’s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.
 Yet Trump’s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America’s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.

BERLIN (AP) — The German government’s tax revenue is likely to sink by 81.5 billion euros ($88.4 billion) this year as a result of the coronavirus crisis, the first drop since the financial crisis a decade ago, according to an official estimate released Thursday. A twice-yearly assessment by tax experts, released by the finance ministry, showed that federal, state and local authorities are expected to take in 717.8 billion euros this year, down from 799.3 billion euros in 2019. The previous forecast for this year, made in November, was for an increase to 816.4 billion euros. The new assessment foresees Germany’s tax take recovering to 792.5 billion euros in 2021 and 816 billion euros in 2022. The crisis already has derailed the German government’s dedication to keeping its budget balanced, long a point of pride. After six years in the black, it is borrowing 156 billion euros to finance rescue packages and cover the expected shortfall in tax revenue. Germany is offering a total of more than 1 trillion euros in aid via various packages, which include money to tide small companies and individual entrepreneurs through virus-related closures and to pump capital into bigger companies where needed. The country has Europe's biggest economy. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who characterized the crisis as “a natural disaster,” said the government will put together a stimulus package in early June. “That is exactly the right time. Most of the lockdown measures expire at the end of May — not all, but most of them,\" Scholz said, indicating that it's only possible at that stage to assess what is needed. He said he hopes that the measures will be “transformative,” making a contribution to modernizing the economy and Germany's digital infrastructure, and to...

Peaceful Nelson, Nevada, offers visitors a step back in time to the vibrant mining days of Nevada, the Silver State, an escape from daily life.   This ghost town is off the beaten path, and while standing among its historic buildings one would not think they were just a 45-minute drive from the bright lights of Las Vegas. Those traveling from Vegas on Route 95 will also pass Eldorado Canyon and "the monument," Nevada Historical Marker 9.      After an enjoyable ride through the valley travelers will come upon several original buildings from the 1700s. Originally, Nelson was called Eldorado, named by the Spaniards. They were the first to find gold in the mountains. About 100 years later the miners and prospectors developed the Techatticup Mine, which stands today in Nelson. The mine has a clouded reputation of killings that resulted from labor and management disputes. However, in 1861 the mine was considered to be the most important in the canyon as it produced millions of dollars of gold ore. The mine, a short distance from the Colorado River, was served by steamboats. The name Techatticup came from two Paiute words meaning "hungry" and "bread."      This now ghost of a town produced millions of dollars of copper, silver and gold until the mine closed in 1945.      Today mine tours are offered by stopping at the General Store in Nelson to sign up for the Eldorado Canyon Mine Tours. The buildings offer a historic tour of collectables from the area. Canoe and kayak rentals are available for those wanting to take an adventure on the beautiful Colorado River.      Inside the General Store is a small museum with pictures and information on the filming that takes place at Nelson, along with memorabilia and historic information. All ages will enjoy exploring the museum and walking around outside finding old cars, trucks and airplanes. The planes were used as props for the movie "3,000 Miles to Graceland." This ghost town is a popular area for use in movie backdrops, photo shoots and music videos. The National Geographic Channel's "Brain Games" was filmed in Nelson, as were the movies "Eye of the Beholder" and "Breakdown."      Do not get your hopes up when you travel downhill and see the Texaco sign standing tall among the historic buildings of Nelson. It is also historic. There is not a gas station or place to eat here. However, the General Store offers snacks and drinks. Fill your tank before setting out to visit Nelson.      Once you have completed the exploration of Nelson, continue to the end of the road where a spectacular view of the Colorado River awaits. Pack a picnic and find a rock, bring chairs, or sit in the car and enjoy what nature has to offer. Visitors can walk down to the river from this area.      Coming back uphill from the river, continue past the general store and on the left will be a few houses and a dirt road, Main Street. Turn left and follow it for a desert drive. If it is raining or has recently rained, better go back the way you came. If you are short on gas or time, do not do it! However, if you do continue, it is a climb to the top where big eared jackrabbits might be seen. Keep your camera ready as road runners are fast but you might get a picture, and the burros are much slower -- they will pose longer.      The road will take desert adventurers back down to Highway 95. A left turn goes into Searchlight, another mining town which, in its heyday around 1902 was more populated than Las Vegas. Today about 500 residents call this town home.      A few buildings are left from the mining days. Searchlight has modern structures, too -- gas stations, places to get a drink and some food, including McDonalds. Las Vegas is one hour from Searchlight and 30 minutes from Laughlin.

“The direct-to-consumer clinics have pivoted their marketing message to treating or preventing COVID-19,” Turner told me. “That’s not really shocking, in a way; these are opportunistic businesses, and COVID-19 for them is an opportunity.”
 In a paper scheduled to be published shortly in the prestigious journal Cell Stem Cell, Turner examines how these businesses are “preying on public fears and anxieties” about the pandemic.
 Typically, their claims fall short of actually promising cures or even specific treatments; that holds at bay the Food and Drug Administration, which has sought to shut down clinics offering unproven therapies for conditions such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and erectile dysfunction.

_The following column is the opinion and analysis of the writer._
 True enough, as one reader noted recently, the Daily Star’s morning crop of letters beats a double shot of espresso to get the blood flowing. Last week, however, one hit me like a Lysol margarita. The writer, objecting to a Leonard Pitts Jr. column, pronounced: “Journalism is dead in America.”
 I’m pleased to confirm that journalism is not dead even though, increasingly, some brains seem to be. We now face a growing COVID-19 calamity. In the long term, climate collapse imperils humanity. This is no time to poke out our own eyes like some crazed Oedipus Rex.
