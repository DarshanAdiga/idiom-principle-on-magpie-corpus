LOS ANGELES (AP) — Major League Soccer MVP Carlos Vela will not accompany Los Angeles FC to the league's return tournament in Orlando this month.
 Vela announced his decision Monday, citing his concern for the health of his family, including his pregnant wife, Saioa.
 “I always want to give everything I have to my club, our fans and supporters and the city of LA,” Vela said in a statement. “However, it is in the best interest of the health of my family to stay home and be with my wife during what is a risky pregnancy. I will miss being with my teammates and coaches, but I will be cheering and supporting LAFC from a distance.”
 LAFC general manager John Thorrington said Vela expects to rejoin the club when it returns from the tournament in Orlando. LAFC announced Vela's decision shortly before the team was scheduled to fly to Florida.
 “We stand behind Carlos,” LAFC coach Bob Bradley said. “It’s important for him to be with his family right now. All of his teammates and the coaching staff feel the same way. We always have a mentality that we do what's best for players, what's best for families, and that doesn't change.”
 The absence of Vela is the latest blow to the MLS Is Back tournament, scheduled as the league's return to competition amid the coronavirus pandemic. The first game of the event had to be postponed when six FC Dallas players tested positive for the virus, and other positive tests have popped up around the league while teams headed to Florida, where the virus is spreading rapidly.

Taking note of the substantial number of new COVID-19 infection cases in Rome and Floyd County, the city and county commissions will hold a called joint meeting on Wednesday to discuss the situation with medical leaders.
 "In the last two weeks our numbers have stayed on the rise," Rome Mayor Bill Collins said. "We thought it was a good time to have the commissioners informed and hear from our medical community where we stand."
 Representatives from local hospitals as well as Dr. Gary Voccio, the health director for Georgia Department of Public Health Northwest Health District, are expected to brief commissioners.
 The overall intent of the meeting is to have an open discussion with local medical professionals and get everybody on the same page, Floyd County Commission Chair Scotty Hancock said.
 There doesn't appear to be consideration of another shelter in place order, like the ones issued by both commissions in late March, but Collins said there may be action taken.
 "I will not rule out some action could come out of this," Collins said. "I think our community is of the utmost importance. We need to do everything we can do to make sure it's safe."
 Recently, Savannah became the first city in Georgia to mandate the use of face coverings and commissioners in Clarke County will vote on a similar ordinance Tuesday.
 Those ordinances conflict with Gov. Brian Kemp's orders to "strongly encourage" but not mandate masks. This past week the governor toured the state encouraging people to wear masks to contain the spread of the coronavirus but has gone on the record against mandating such a measure.
 If brought to a vote, Hancock said he personally would not vote to require all county residents to wear a mask in public.
 "I will not support mandated masking requirements," Hancock said.
 Wednesday's meeting will be held at 3 p.m. in the ballroom of the Forum River Center, 301 Tribune St., in downtown Rome.
 While the meeting is open to the public, everyone in attendance is asked to wear a mask and practice social distancing by staying at least six feet apart.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Several Native American leaders and organizations sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Monday calling for the league to force Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change the team name immediately.
 The letter obtained by The Associated Press is signed by 15 Native American advocates. It demands the team and the NFL cease the use of Native American names, imagery and logos — with specific importance put on Washington, which last week launched a “thorough review” of its name.
 The groups “expect the NFL to engage in a robust, meaningful reconciliation process with Native American movement leaders, tribes, and organizations to repair the decades of emotional violence and other serious harms this racist team name has caused to Native Peoples."
 The NFL did not immediately respond to a message confirming receipt of the letter. Goodell last week expressed support for Snyder's review process of the name.
 Retired PGA Tour golfer Notah Begay, two former executive directors of the National Congress of American Indians and several authors and professors signed on to the letter, which came the same day President Donald Trump criticized the Redskins and Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians for considering name changes.
 Trump tweeted: "They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct.”

In the new research, Weinberger and his colleagues turned their attention to cytomegalovirus. They noticed under the microscope that some particles of cytomegalovirus had very high levels of a protein called pp71, while others did not. pp71 is involved in the replication of the viral DNA and also helps the virus evade the human body's immune response, but it was puzzling why some particles contained so much more of the protein than others.

 A Dagsboro man was arrested twice in three days on drug charges.
 Around 8 p.m. on Thursday, July 2, Delaware State Police were dispatched to check on the welfare of a man slumped at the steering wheel in the parking lot of the M&T; Bank, on Dupont Boulevard, in Frankord. According to police, they woke up 38-year-old Richard Zawora, who was confused and showed signs of impairment. He was found in possession of 3.32 grams of heroin, less than a gram of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Zawora was charged with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance in a tier two quantity, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana. He was later released on $2,100 unsecured bond.
 Then, around 6:40 p.m. on Saturday, July 4, troopers responded to the 32000 block of Swamp Road, in Dagsboro, for reports of Zawora slumped over the steering wheel of a pickup stopped in the roadway. They determined him to be under the influence and found him to be in possession of 3.731 grams of heroin and a small amount of marijuana. He was charged with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance in a tier two quantity, third-offense driving under the influence, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of marijuana and stopping on a roadway. He was committed to Howard R. Young Correctional Institution on a $13,102 secured bond.

Kanye West's irrelevancy sense must have been tingling, because the rapper tweeted this weekend that he is "running for president." While West's bid immediately garnered the "full support" of Elon Musk, basically no one else believes it's anything other than a desperate cry for attention, seeing as West hasn't actually registered with the Federal Election Commission or collected enough signatures to be on the ballot, and he's already missed the deadline to file as an independent in "many states." While Kanye has teased running for president before, his follow-through tends to leave much to be desired (remember when he promised us Kanyeland?). As _Jezebel_ suggests, West's tweet is more likely "a cheap shot at headline-grabbing promo for that new album he just announced."

Instead, how prostate cancers regulate gene expression - which genes are turned off and on, and to what extent - tends to go awry. What causes this aberrant gene regulation has been a mystery. Although previous research had identified pieces of DNA throughout the genome that appeared to be connected to prostate cancer, many of these pieces weren't genes, so their role was unclear.
