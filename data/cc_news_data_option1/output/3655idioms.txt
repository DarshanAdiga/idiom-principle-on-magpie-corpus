Boca del Rio, Ver. – "Nos las estamos viendo negras", dice Miguel mientras camina por la avenida Juan Pablo II, pidiendo a los conductores que le regalen una moneda, del otro lado del Campus Mocambo de la UV en Boca del Rio esta Victoriano, que al igual que su compañero trabajaban como empacadores en un supermercado.   Tras cinco meses de haberse quedado sin trabajo como empacadores Victoriano y Miguel tienen que salir todos los dias a pedir dinero en las calles de Boca del Rio, para poder conseguir algo de comer y cubrir sus gastos diarios. Por ser uno de los sectores de la poblacion con mas riesgo a padecer covid-19, muchos de los supermercados tomaron la decision de suspender indefinidamente los trabajos de empacadores, que en su mayoria eran ocupados por personas de la tercera edad.  Fue en el mes de marzo que suspendieron labores debido a que recien iniciaba la pandemia por el covid en el estado, ahora las consecuencias de no tener trabajo ya se estan viendo reflejadas en las multiples deudas que tienen que pagar.  "Hemos tenido que empeñar y vender nuestras cosas, tengo tres recibos de agua caidos que no he podido pagar y ademas el de la luz", comento Miguel. Son alrededor de 10 personas de la tercera edad que se quedaron sin su unico ingreso, la mayoria de ellos tienen que salir a pedir la ayuda de las personas en las calles para poder sobrevivir ante la falta de empleo.  "Lo unico que queremos es trabajar" Del otro lado sobre el bulevar Adolfo Ruiz Cortines se encuentra Victoriano, al igual que Miguel sostiene una cartulina con la cual piden el apoyo de los ciudadanos. Él comenta que lo unico que quiere es volver a trabajar, ya que no cuenta con ningun apoyo economico que lo pueda ayudar a sobre llevar la contingencia.  De la misma manera las deudas que tienen que pagar lo llevaron a tomar la decision de ponerse en las calles a pedir dinero, de otra manera nunca lo hubiera hechos, afirmo.  Los dos hombres afirman que en el primer mes la empresa donde trabajaban les dio una despensa para ayudarlos, mientras que el resto ya no recibieron nada, por lo cual optaron por salir. Desde las ocho de la mañana se ponen en aquel lugar, hasta las dos de la tarde aguantando las inclemencias del tiempo, pero Victorino dice que hoy se ira mas temprano ya que sus años no le permiten estar mucho tiempo de pie.  "Yo ya pase mi edad, lo que me reste de vida ya es ganancia para mi", afirmo Miguel, ambos aseguran no temer enfermarse, pues dicen no temerle a la muerte. Veracruz el estado con mas adultos mayores Segun estadisticas del Instituto Nacional de las Personas Adultas Mayores (Inapam) en el pais hay alrededor de 10 millones 055 mil 379 personas con de mas de 60 años. Siendo el estado de Veracruz el tercero con mas poblacion de la tercera edad, solo por detras de la Ciudad de Mexico y Oaxaca. Mientras que, en todo el pais una tercera parte de la poblacion adulta mayor trabaja para el mercado laboral, con marcadas diferencias entre mujeres y hombres, 19.4 por ciento de ellas y 50.8 de ellos. Las principales ocupaciones de las personas adultas comprenden en el comercio, en servicios personales, industria, artesania y ayudantia, asi como en el area agropecuaria. Quienes realizan actividades economicas lo hacen con mayor frecuencia en jornadas de 35 a 48 horas semanales, segun datos el documento de la Situacion de las personas adultas mayores en Mexico. En el 2018 la a Comision Nacional del Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro (Consar), estimo que 2.5 millones de personas mayores de 65 años no reciben ningun tipo de pension. Por lo cual se ven en la necesidad de trabajar para tener un ingreso, al igual que Victoriano y Miguel quienes salen todos los dias exponiendo sus vidas, ya que aseguran no contar con ningun tipo de pension o ayuda del gobierno. ygr

Ryan Fitzpatrick would make a bad throw that was picked off by Stephon Gilmore, fresh off a new raise and picking up where he spent most of 2019 – making plays on the ball. It set the Patriots up on the Dolphins 35-yard-line. New England couldn't do anything with it though and ended up losing yardage as Newton took a third-down sack. They were forced to punt, missing on an opportunity to take a two-score lead in the game.

Once Kevin and Enzo fall too, we're down to four members of The Committee battling it out: Tyler, Nicole, Cody, and Dani. Tyler falls next, which is all Dani wanted. She's considering getting revenge for him throwing her under the bus with Da'Vonne and Bayleigh, and she's not convinced he won't target her. With Tyler gone, we're left with three people who, and I can't believe I'm saying this, _don 't want to win! _They all admit it in the Diary Room! Nicole feels secure with her alliance and doesn't want to nominate anyone and cause trouble, Cody feels like it's time for Dani or Nicole to get "blood on their hands," and Dani simply wanted to make sure Tyler didn't win. So, it all comes down to who's able to throw the competition without _looking_ like they threw it. Once Nicole drops, Cody decides to follow suit, and that leaves Dani with her first HOH of the season. For us at home, she's certainly the most intriguing option out of The Committee members who could have won. She's unpredictable enough that she might try to shake things up.

The Grand Army of the Republic Mound at Oak Ridge Cemetery was rededicated at a ceremony Sunday afternoon.
   
 The GAR Mound is the final resting place of 98 Civil War Union Army veterans including eight veterans from the United States Colored Troops. The USCT were regiments in the Union Army composed primarily of Black soldiers. There were about 175 such regiments by the end of the Civil War in 1865.
   
 Local dignitaries, along with members of the Veterans Memorial Foundation, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War and the 114th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry (Reactivated) participated in the rededication ceremony of the mound and refurbished monument.
   
 The board of managers of Oak Ridge Cemetery set aside a plot of cemetery ground in 1891 for the burial of Civil War Union Army veterans who did not have a family plot elsewhere. The plot received its first interment in later that year with the death of retired Army Cpl. Matthew C. Henry, formerly of Company G, 130th Illinois Infantry.
   
 The memorial monument was completed in 1895 and the GAR Stephenson Post #30 dedicated it that same year. (Benjamin F. Stephenson, a practicing physician in Springfield, started the Grand Army of the Republic in 1866. He was a major in the 114th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment.)
   
 The GAR Mound is located in Block 10, Lot A.

Olympique Marseille earned a smash-and-grab 1-0 win at Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain after forward Florian Thauvin struck in the 31st minute of a pulsating though ill-tempered match at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. Littered with fouls throughout, the clash boiled over in the last minute of stoppage time with referee Jerome Brisard sending off five players after a full scale brawl broke out on the pitch.Paris Saint Germain's Neymar, Laywin Kurzawa and Leandro Paredes as well as Marseille's duo of Dario Benedetto and Jordan Amavi were given their marching orders after rival players threw punches and kicks at each other.But it did not bother Marseille manager Andre Villas-Boas after the 1993 European Cup winners celebrated their first league win against PSG since November 2011."A tough and important win as well as a historic one," Villas-Boas told reporters after his side condemned last season's Champions League runners-up to a second successive defeat following a 1-0 opening day setback at Lens. "We struggled to cope with PSG's early pressure because they are very good at it, but we found a way to grind out a great victory. It wasn't pretty and we suffered." Thauvin scored against the run of play, steering in a Dimitri Payet free kick inside the near post from close range after the home side had come close through Marco Verratti and Neymar, who also missed a pair of chances in the second half.Visiting keeper Steve Mandanda pulled off several superb saves before both sides had a goal disallowed for offside as the pace and intensity went up a gear after the break. Angel Di Maria's effort for PSG was ruled out in the 62nd minute and Benedetto's scorcher was also scrapped two minutes later as Thauvin, who unleashed the initial shot, was marginally behind the last PSG defender.Missing several first-team regulars who had contracted the COVID-19 virus, PSG pressed hard in the closing stages but Marseille's rugged defence held firm. PSG sports director Leonardo, a former World Cup winner with Brazil, criticised the referee's actions. "A total of 14 cards were brandished and five of them were red, which means the match got out of control," Leonardo told the Telefoot television channel."(Brisard) lost his head. He officiated the League Cup final but he doesn't have the experience for this kind of fixture." (Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic; Edititng by Pritha Sarkar)

That means that the film’s actual Friday to Saturday weekend debut was less than $10 million, or approximately $9.4 million, when you also figure in the studio’s self-reported 29% drop for the current Friday to Sunday frame.
 Pre-pandemic, a 29% drop would have been considered scant. But now that films released theatrically are expected to recoup their budgets in a smaller, more unpredictable market, it’s unclear whether Warner Bros. will clear its $200-million investment even after weeks of “Tenet’s” theatrical release. According to the industry trade publication Variety, “Tenet” has to earn “approximately $400 million worldwide to break even and closer to $450 million” to make a profit.
 Warner Bros.’ decision to push “Wonder Woman 1984" from an October opening to Christmas can be viewed as a direct response to “Tenet’s” performance so far and hints that Warner Bros. hopes the Nolan movie will have legs as it plays uncontested by other major films until indoor theaters reopen in New York and L.A.

Officials in West Coast states where record fires have killed 35 people accused President Donald Trump on Sunday of being in denial about climate change, as he and political rival Kamala Harris prepared to meet emergency workers in California.
 "This is climate change, and this is an administration that's put its head in the sand," said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, speaking on CNN's "State of the Union."
 Trump plans to meet Monday with the heads of California's emergency services, battling history-making infernos that have now burned through nearly five million acres (two million hectares) across the US West, an area roughly the size of the state of New Jersey.
 Harris, the Democratic vice presidential candidate who tweeted that Trump "denied evidence" the flames were "fueled and intensified by the climate crisis," will also travel to California to assess the damage and meet fire officials.
 Of at least 35 people killed by the blazes since the beginning of summer, 27 died this week alone. Dozens were still missing on Sunday.
 Trump has made little comment about the blazes in recent weeks, but at a Nevada campaign event on Saturday he acknowledged the scope of the disaster.
 "They never had anything like this," said Trump, who systematically downplays global warming. "Please remember the words, very simple, forest management."
 Garcetti hit back, saying that "anybody that lives in California is insulted by that."
 "Talk to a firefighter if you think that climate change isn't real... This isn't about forest management or raking."
 With battle lines drawn ahead of November's election, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is also due to address the wildfires and their cause Monday.
 He recently called the threat of climate change "undeniable" and "existential."
 - 'In shock' -
 Much of the West Coast remained coated in dense smog through Sunday, with Portland by a distance the world's most air-polluted city according to IQAir.
 "It's apocalyptic," Washington state Governor Jay Inslee told ABC's "This Week."
 "It's maddening right now we have this cosmic challenge to our communities, the entire West Coast of the United States on fire, to have a president to deny that these are not just wildfires, these are climate fires," he said.
 Most of the fatalities have occurred in California and Oregon, with emergency services in the two states recording 34 deaths.
 More than 30,000 firefighters are battling the blazes, with officials warning that improved weather could end Monday as windier conditions return to the dry region.
 Residents of Arcadia, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, were ordered to evacuate Sunday as the nearby Bobcat Fire spread south through forested terrain toward the metropolis.
 Two new deaths were confirmed from the North Complex Fire, which swept at unprecedented speeds this week into areas already ravaged less than two years ago by the Camp Fire -- California's deadliest ever blaze.
 "There are still active fires, power lines are down, trees are down, there are roads that are impassable," said Sheriff Kory Honea, warning evacuees it could take "weeks and weeks" to return to their homes.
 Paul Clement described to AFP how he fled his home in Berry Creek.
 "When I came around the bend, everything was on fire -- an entire hillside. So I ended up driving through and you couldn't see fifty feet (15 meters)."
 "It was worse than the Camp Fire, which I didn't think was possible."
 California has seen 3.3 million acres burn -- an annual record, with more than three months of the fire season still to come -- and over 4,100 structures destroyed.
 - 'Wake-up call' -
 Near the Beachie Creek Fire, east of Oregon state capital Salem, police had set up multiple road blockades on Sunday. Long lines of cars stretched in front of them, waiting in the thick fog to pass through.
 Many were farmers trying to go home and feed their livestock.
 "We went back to Mill City this morning, but police advised us not to as it is dangerous," resident Elaina Early told AFP. "The house is ok, but we leave now because the conditions are really not good."
 "My son is six and he is in shock, it's hard for him," the 36-year-old added. "He keeps telling me, 'We live in a hotel now?'"
 Preparations have been hampered by online claims that "extremists" are intentionally setting fires in Oregon, rumors debunked by the FBI.
 Nearly one million acres of land have been torched in Oregon, double the normal annual amount, Governor Kate Brown said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation."
 "This is a wake-up call for all of us, that we have got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change," Brown said.

Tyler isn't in the dark here. He knows that he wronged Dani and that he's on thin ice with her. So, he tries to just be honest. He tells her that he'd understand if he was nominated or backdoored in the case of a veto being used. With Tyler, honesty is more a strategy than it is a humbling moment. His whole thing is trying to be charming enough that people don't want to target him. He did the same thing with Da'Vonne and Bayeligh last week. His goal in the house is to be the strong player who's also loved by everybody, and this bad blood with Dani could ruin that (though what's really ruining that strategy is his compulsion to talk game and alliances with _everybody_ and therefore ensure that someone is going to feel betrayed at some point).

The longtime Chargers star who signed a one-year, $25 million contract to join the Colts in March completed 36 of 46 passes for 363 yards and a touchdown. But the costly turnovers overshadowed everything else.
 Rookie CJ Henderson picked off Rivers early, leading to a tying touchdown and giving the young Jaguars confidence and momentum. Second-year safety Andrew Wingard got Rivers late, setting up a field goal that provided Jacksonville a little cushion down the stretch.
 "The second one, yeah, I'd like to have it back," Rivers said. "But I didn't think I was being reckless. Those are decisions you have to make in the heat of it. Certainly those turnovers hurt."
 Rivers needed a touchdown to tie on Indy's final drive, but Henderson got a hand on his fourth-down pass to T.Y. Hilton. Hilton said afterward that Henderson didn't even touch the ball, although replays showed otherwise.
 "I lost the game. Two drops. Never should've happened," Hilton said. "He got nothing on both of them. That was just me."
 There was plenty of other blame to go around for the Colts, who led most of the day and outgained Jacksonville by more than 200 yards.
 Coach Frank Reich went for it on fourth down from the 3-yard line early and failed to get points when Nyheim Hines got stuffed. A chip-shot field goal would have put Indy up 10-0.
 "I felt like that play was going to work, but it didn't," said Reich, who knelt next to his standing players during the national anthem. "So we got outcoached and outplayed on that play."
 Rookie kicker Rodrigo Blankenship banged a ball off the left upright from 30 yards, another missed scoring opportunity. And safety Kenny Moore aided Jacksonville's go-ahead scoring drive in the fourth period with a horse-collar tackle that drew a 15-yard penalty.

There's a little more strategy going on here than usual. Da'Vonne is the first to have her own idea about how to use this challenge. In the Diary Room, she says that she's largely being kept in the house because everyone thinks they can beat her in the challenges, so she's going to play right into that idea. She drops out after only 15 minutes and musters some fake tears for her audience of houseguests. It's a bold move considering she was just on the block, but it could pay off in the long run. More baffling and less strategic is Memphis' choice to purposely drop out after the first three players have gone (David and Ian follow Da'Vonne, and all three become the Have-Nots for the week). He openly admits he just didn't want to be a Have-Not for the week, and gives up any chance at the HOH. He must feel pretty secure in his position.

JONES COUNTY, Miss. (WDAM) - Preparations for Tropical Storm Sally are underway after Jones County and Laurel officials were briefed by the National Weather Service Sunday.“Our area will probably start seeing impact late Monday evening and should last through sometime on Tuesday,” Jones County Emergency Operations Center Executive Director Paul Sheffield said. “The chance of rain is probably going to continue past Tuesday. The biggest thing the weather service is discussing with this storm is it’s slow, it is going to be a slow-moving event, that is going to cause more flooding.”Sheffield says Jones County could see 4 to 8 inches of rain and strong wind gusts.“There’s a chance we could see some power outages,” Sheffield said. “If we get 40 mph winds for 8 to 12 hours and we get heavy rain, those trees are going to fall. There’s a really good chance those trees could hit a power line.”He reminds everyone to avoid flooded roads at all times.“This is not Laura, but this threat is a lot closer to us than Laura was,” Sheffield said. “Granted, it’s probably not going to make it to a major hurricane status, but there’s more people killed in hurricanes from water than they are from winds. Whether that be storm surge, whether that be aerial rain, whatever it may be, pay attention, don’t drive through flooded roadways. Once this starts, don’t be out moving unless you have to be.”With an active storm season, Sheffield says it’s important to always have a plan and emergency kits ready, regardless of the storm threat level.“It’s always better to be safe than sorry,” Sheffield said. “I would much rather get prepared every time we have an event like this and then not needed, than to just brush it off and then something bad happens.”Jones County EOC will have another briefing with the National Weather Service Monday.Copyright 2020 WDAM.

Olympique Marseille earned a smash-and-grab 1-0 win at Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain after forward Florian Thauvin struck in the 31st minute of a pulsating though ill-tempered match at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. Littered with fouls throughout, the clash boiled over in the last minute of stoppage time with referee Jerome Brisard sending off five players after a full scale brawl broke out on the pitch.
 Paris Saint Germain's Neymar, Laywin Kurzawa and Leandro Paredes as well as Marseille's duo of Dario Benedetto and Jordan Amavi were given their marching orders after rival players threw punches and kicks at each other.
 But it did not bother Marseille manager Andre Villas-Boas after the 1993 European Cup winners celebrated their first league win against PSG since November 2011.
 "A tough and important win as well as a historic one," Villas-Boas told reporters after his side condemned last season's Champions League runners-up to a second successive defeat following a 1-0 opening day setback at Lens.
 "We struggled to cope with PSG's early pressure because they are very good at it, but we found a way to grind out a great victory. It wasn't pretty and we suffered."
 Thauvin scored against the run of play, steering in a Dimitri Payet free kick inside the near post from close range after the home side had come close through Marco Verratti and Neymar, who also missed a pair of chances in the second half.
 Visiting keeper Steve Mandanda pulled off several superb saves before both sides had a goal disallowed for offside as the pace and intensity went up a gear after the break.
 Angel Di Maria's effort for PSG was ruled out in the 62nd minute and Benedetto's scorcher was also scrapped two minutes later as Thauvin, who unleashed the initial shot, was marginally behind the last PSG defender.
 Missing several first-team regulars who had contracted the COVID-19 virus, PSG pressed hard in the closing stages but Marseille's rugged defence held firm.
 PSG sports director Leonardo, a former World Cup winner with Brazil, criticised the referee's actions.
 "A total of 14 cards were brandished and five of them were red, which means the match got out of control," Leonardo told the Telefoot television channel.
 "(Brisard) lost his head. He officiated the League Cup final but he doesn't have the experience for this kind of fixture."

Some quick personnel observations… Brandon Copeland saw time at inside linebacker. Rookie Michael Onewnu appeared to be the swing backup tackle and saw some second-half snaps at right tackle. Byron Cowart started at defensive tackle alongside Lawrence Guy and also partially blocked Miami's successful field goal in the second quarter. Ryan Izzo was a workhorse at tight end after a solid training camp. Kyle Dugger, Jason McCourty and Shilique Calhoun entered the lineup on third defensive drive. Jonathan Jones seemed heavily featured in a safety role. Xavier Williams entered the game on the fourth defensive drive. Derek Rivers was used primarily as a designated pass rusher. JoeJuan Williams was a third-and-long sub, covering tight ends. Anfernee Jennings saw some action in the goal-line defense and was in on a nice second- down stop. Justin Herron saw some goal-line snaps at tackle. Devin Asiasi served primarily as a back-up blocking tight end.

Lamorne Morris, who was never not funny as Winston Bishop in "New Girl," has a new show, "Woke," in which he takes center stage. The show, which premiered Wednesday on Hulu, is inspired by the life and work of comics artist Keith Knight ("The K Chronicles," "The Knight Life"), who created the show with Marshall Todd ("Barbershop"), and it's a mutually good fit for actor and series -- smart, likable, a little weird, hard to pin down.
 A largely successful mix of genres and themes -- some romance, some wacky cohabitation comedy and some social satire, regarding identity, authenticity, justice, performative rage and real exhaustion -- "Woke" does sometimes go just where you might expect, but more often does not. Set in and more than usually about San Francisco (represented by stock shots, a drag queen and Vancouver, Canada), it is timely enough that the novel coronavirus is mentioned -- production wrapped at the end of February -- but not so timely that more than one person is seen wearing a mask.
 The epigram that begins the series, "Inspired by one experience … shared by many," suggests that we are going to see something of broad social import but that "one experience" matters as much as "shared by many," if not more. "Woke" is political, but not polemical -- a conversation, not a sermon. And if it is a story about race, it's also one of a more or less reasonable person in a world of knuckleheads, trying to make sense of himself.
 Morris plays Keef, the Knight stand-in, creator of a locally published popular comic strip called "Toast-n-Butter" that is about to go into syndication. He is ready to move up and move out of the apartment he shares with Clovis (T. Murph) and Gunther (Blake Anderson) and into a condominium with his lawyer girlfriend, and if you have seen television before, you know that this is not going to happen. Home is where the wacky best friends are. Clovis gets by reselling limited-edition sneakers and approaches women with tired pickup lines and absurd lies. (This sounds bad on paper; his character fills out in practice.) As Gunther, Anderson is not far from the spacey stoner he played on "Workaholics," though he has more dimension here, more plausibility. We meet him trying to sell his roommates on investing in a new waterless "energy drink" that is basically cocaine.
 Hanging out at his neighborhood comics store one day, Keith is approached excitedly by Ayana (Sasheer Zamata, formerly of "Saturday Night Live"). She runs an alternative paper, the Bay Arean, which comes out sounding like Bay Aryan; I'm not sure this is meant to be a joke, since no one comments on it, but it sticks out.
 "I … love how 'T&B' talks about race and color in America," she tells Keef. "When toast gets too dark and the man scrapes it off and puts butter on it. Facts."
 "Wow, that's the first time I heard that one," says Keith, who claims he is not controversial.
 "You're a Black cartoonist, you're controversial just by existing."
 "Why is it us people of color are always having to stand for something or say something in our work?" he asks her. "It's just a comic strip about bored breakfast food."
 Things change. Keef is out posting fliers for a comic convention appearance when a phalanx of police officers surrounds him with guns drawn; he is pinned to the ground for a harrowing minute before the cops determine he is not the Black man they're looking for and evaporate.
 Keef tries to move on, but in the aftermath of the incident (an amplification of something that happened to Keith Knight himself 20 years ago), suffering from a sort of PTSD, he finds himself harangued by talking inanimate objects: a trash can, malt liquor bottles and, most crucially, his own marker (played by J.B. Smoove, who is also never not funny), which has contrary ideas about what Keef should be drawing. All conspire to drive him toward enlightenment and engagement. ("Your third eye is definitely open for business," says one of the bottles.) It will take him awhile to get there, and not before this chorus of things robs him of his work, his girl and his previously envisioned bright future.
 Notwithstanding Keef being jumped by the police, "Woke's" focus is not exactly the drama that's played out in streets across the country these last months but rather the not-unrelated subject of cultural appropriation and dilution in a seemingly groovy city where tech money is driving out the poor. ("Man bun co-optin', gentrifyin' devils," the talking trash can calls the newcomers.) "I am just calling out the idea that San Francisco loves Black culture but not Black people," Keef says at one point, but he meets Black art snobs as well.
 The strength of the series is that the characters ultimately speak for themselves. They remain individuals, imperfectly aligned even with their own stated agendas. And Morris has an everyman, leading man charm that keeps Keef appealing when he runs off course. A lot of this has to do with well-written dialogue that is allowed to wander off a point. Especially well handled is Keef's tentative relationship with Adrienne (Rose McIver), an artist he meets on the rebound. They have a real couple's relaxed chemistry, though they are not quite a couple. But this richness holds for the rest of the cast and their sometimes surprising connections as well.
 The series, which in its more surreal moments recalls left-of-center satires from half a century ago, like Jules Feiffer's "Little Murders" or Robert Downey Sr.'s "Putney Swope," gets weird quickly, then gets a little less weird -- the talking things quiet down for awhile, before Keith David wakes things up as the voice of the Holy Bible -- then gets weird in a different way, before coming to a season ending that could easily serve as a series ending. It feels conclusive, if open-ended; decisions have been taken, characters developed, Keef enters a new phase in his relationship to the world. I'm not saying I wouldn't like a second helping, though new seasons sometimes just unwind the progress of the characters to keep things "interesting." But I felt satisfied.

Six-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton took a knee before the start of the Tuscan Grand Prix on Sunday with a message on his T-shirt declaring "Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor". The words "say her name" and a photograph of Taylor were on the back of Briton Hamilton's black shirt as he knelt with other drivers before the anthem as part of the sport's now-regular anti-racism stance.The Mercedes driver, the sport's only Black competitor who has previously worn a "Black Lives Matter" T-shirt in such occasions, won the race at Italy's Mugello circuit.He wore the Taylor shirt again on the podium as he celebrated victory.Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed by police officers who burst into her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, in March.One police officer involved was fired by the city's police department in June. Two other officers have been placed on administrative reassignment. No criminal charges have been filed against any of the three. U.S. Open tennis winner Naomi Osaka wore a face mask with Taylor's name on it as one of a series of masks she wore on her way to the title and Hamilton hailed the Japanese player's action."It took me a long time to get that shirt," he told reporters afterwards."I've been wanting to wear that and bring awareness to the fact that there's people there that have been killed on the street and there's someone that got killed in her own house. And those guys are still walking free. "We have to continue to raise awareness with it and Naomi has been doing amazing, so huge congratulations to her. I think she's an incredible inspiration with what she's done with her platform."Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said on Saturday Hamilton, who has been a prominent campaigner for diversity and racial equality, was free to make whatever anti-racism statement he wanted.

Black and Blue: Panthers prepare for season opener against Raiders


--DocBreak--
Welcome to Cleveland, Kevin Stefanski.
   
 There's no way around it. Gut-check time has already arrived for the Browns under their new head coach.
   
 Quarterback Baker Mayfield called the team's 38-6 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Sunday's season opener at M&T; Bank Stadium "a wake-up call" and "a nice punch in the mouth."
   
 The point is what happens next is crucial.
   
 A humiliating Week 1 loss doesn't need to define an NFL season, but it can provide foreshadowing, especially if the response isn't swift and strong.
   
 A year ago during the head coaching debut of Freddie Kitchens, the Browns committed 18 penalties in a 43-13 loss to the Tennessee Titans. Even though they won their next game 23-3 over the New York Jets, the lack of discipline and maturity they displayed in the opener became a central theme of their disappointing 2019 season, which ended with a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, a record of 6-10 and Kitchens being fired after just one season at the helm.
   
 Well, the Bengals are involved again. They'll visit the Browns on Thursday night for the home opener at FirstEnergy Stadium, and Stefanski's men need to show they can immediately bounce back from the slew of mistakes they committed against the defending AFC North champion Ravens, a loss that dropped the Browns to 1-20-1 in openers since 1999.
   
 "We addressed the team, and we're ready to get this out of our mouths as soon as possible," defensive end Myles Garrett said. "We're trying to flush this and get on to Cincinnati as soon as possible. Make it 1-1 for us."
   
 Neither Stefanski nor his players who addressed media on Zoom after Sunday's setback would use circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse for the embarrassing outing. But the bottom line is it matters.
   
 The Ravens are one of the best teams in the NFL. They went 14-2 last season, they're led by a coach, John Harbaugh, who's in his 13th season on the job, and quarterback Lamar Jackson is coming off an MVP year.
   
 When the global health crisis prompted the NFL to eliminate all spring practices and preseason games, teams with new coaching staffs, like the Browns, found themselves in an incredibly difficult position.
   
 On the other hand, the Browns have a roster loaded with talent, which they have yet to capitalize on, so they shouldn't be granted a pass for getting their doors blown off like they did Sunday.
   
 "They were just the more prepared team," Garrett said. "Whether that was because we have more new guys, new coaches, schemes and all that, that's irrelevant. At the end of the day, nobody is going to feel sorry for you."
   
 Garrett is correct. However, the Browns didn't face the pandemic-related obstacles in Week 1 of the 2019 season that they encountered Sunday. The result feels the same, but the situation is much different, even if team leaders are unwilling to reflect on the factors publicly.
   
 "Now is not a time for us to start thinking about last season or thinking about anything else," wide receiver Jarvis Landry said. "We came and we played our hardest. We didn't win this one. We get an opportunity to play in a couple of days for another one. It's a long season. We can't define everything by this first one."
   
 Mayfield said "the makeup of this team" gives him confidence the Browns can rebound.
   
 "There's a different attitude about it," he said. "We're going to watch the film and get it out of our system. That's the good thing about having a short week. We don't have to dwell on it. We'll watch it, realize where we went wrong, correct those mistakes and move on to Cincinnati. We don't have a lot of time to dwell on the negative things."
   
 The list of miscues the Browns must correct is long.
   
 The Browns had eight penalties for 80 yards. The Ravens had seven penalties for 66 yards.
   
 The Browns had three turnovers compared with one by the Ravens.
   
 Mayfield was intercepted on the game's opening possession when defensive lineman Calais Campbell broke up a pass intended for receiver KhaDarel Hodge and cornerback Marlon Humphrey picked it off. Jamie Gillan lost a fumble on an ill-fated fake punt on fourth-and-4 from the Cleveland 31-yard line in the first quarter, and running back Nick Chubb coughed up the ball on the final play of the third quarter. The Ravens scored two touchdowns and a field goal off those takeaways.
   
 Mayfield went 21 of 39 passing for 189 yards and a touchdown with an interception for a passer rating of 65.The offense converted just 3 of 12 third downs compared with the Ravens going 6 of 11 on third downs.
   
 "It's hard to say we did anything well. We only scored six points," said Stefanski, who called the offense's plays.
   
 The defense couldn't contain Jackson (20 of 25 passing for 275 yards and three TDs with no interceptions for a rating of 152.1), tight end Mark Andrews (five catches on six targets for 58 yards and two TDs) or receivers Marquise Brown (five catches on six targets for 101 yards) and Willie Snead (four catches on four targets for 64 yards and a TD). A Gillan punt downed at the Baltimore 1 in the second quarter didn't faze Jackson and Co. They marched 99 yards in 10 plays, capping the drive with rookie J.K. Dobbins' 3-yard run, the Ohio State product's first of two rushing TDs.
   
 "The last thing I can do is to get down on this one because we did not play mistake-free," Garrett said. "We gave the ball up. We busted coverages. We did not get to Lamar enough. That's on us. We just have to keep it moving."
   
 Austin Seibert missed both of his kicks -- an extra point after tight end David Njoku's 1-yard touchdown catch from Mayfield late in the first quarter -- and a 41-yard field goal a play after the Browns would have gained a first down if receiver Odell Beckham Jr. hadn't dropped a pass at the Baltimore 20 on third-and-2 from the 23 with 46 seconds left in the second quarter. The Ravens scored a touchdown off the sequence, going ahead 24-6 at halftime.
   
 "That's a momentum killer," left guard Joel Bitonio said.
   
 A dud of an opener doesn't mean the Browns are destined for another double- digit loss season, but more brutal momentum this week would be a devastating start for Stefanski. The Browns have back-to-back home games against the Bengals (0-1) and Washington Football Team (1-0) before a road game against the Dallas Cowboys.
   
 "It's extremely important," Mayfield said of the "Thursday Night Football" matchup against the Bengals, "especially a short week with another division opponent. These ones are always extremely important, so we have to treat it as such. We'll be ready."
   
 And if they are indeed ready, it'll be the first time this season.

__Comments Off on An Indian Summer Finale: Can’t help falling in Love

Last week a Star Citizen player made a video about its atmospheric room system, which has been in the works for four years, expressing frustration with the amount of progress made. Cloud Imperium Games director Chris Roberts replied on the Star Citizen forum, saying that the systemic approach being taken would mean more emergent possibilities, but "The downside of this approach is that it takes longer to see results as opposed to scripting actions as you have to build the fundamental systems first and have them interact with each other before the full extent of the gameplay becomes apparent."
 His appearance caused a brief fuss, with the video's maker addressing him directly to say, "What you, Chris, describe in your comment would take at the very least take another 10-20 years."
 Roberts replied at length, providing some insight into his thinking as well as the game's future.
 Roberts began philosophically, saying that, "My biggest disappointment with modern internet discourse is that there's a significant amount of cynicism, especially in forum or reddit debates, and a portion of people assume the worst. If a feature is missing, late or buggy it's because the company or the developer lied and or / is incompetent as opposed to the fact that it just took longer and had more problems than the team thought it would when they originally set out to build it."
 He  went on to say that Star Citizen's developers can be just as frustrated by how long things take, pointing out that, "Management doesn't dictate timelines, we just set priorities for the teams as there are always a lot more things to do at any one time than we have people to do them."
 He explained that as Star Citizen grows the amount of work it takes to maintain what's there also grows, creating a tension between the desire to add new features and the need to improve and provide support for what's already there. This has led to the new format for quarterly Star Citizen roadmaps, which include several caveats--like the note that singleplayer component Squadron 42, "will only be released when we have achieved our final, polished, creative vision."
 Among Star Citizen's players (hi, I own a ship) its community is often called fractious and argumentative, but compared to almost every other forum for a specific game on the internet, Star Citizen's forum is a den of civility. It's hard to imagine a director descending into their own forum elsewhere with an essay like this and having it responded to, even by those who remain upset, with predominantly thoughtful and articulate statements.
 In Roberts' closing he notes that, "I can promise you the gameplay I described is not a pipe dream, nor will it take 10 to 20 years to deliver."
 Star Citizen is currently having a Free Fly trial period.

 The Grand Army of the Republic Mound at Oak Ridge Cemetery was rededicated at a ceremony Sunday afternoon.
 The GAR Mound is the final resting place of 98 Civil War Union Army veterans including eight veterans from the United States Colored Troops. The USCT were regiments in the Union Army composed primarily of Black soldiers. There were about 175 such regiments by the end of the Civil War in 1865.
 Local dignitaries, along with members of the Veterans Memorial Foundation, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War and the 114th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry (Reactivated) participated in the rededication ceremony of the mound and refurbished monument.
 The board of managers of Oak Ridge Cemetery set aside a plot of cemetery ground in 1891 for the burial of Civil War Union Army veterans who did not have a family plot elsewhere. The plot received its first interment in later that year with the death of retired Army Cpl. Matthew C. Henry, formerly of Company G, 130th Illinois Infantry.
 The memorial monument was completed in 1895 and the GAR Stephenson Post #30 dedicated it that same year. (Benjamin F. Stephenson, a practicing physician in Springfield, started the Grand Army of the Republic in 1866. He was a major in the 114th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment.)
 The GAR Mound is located in Block 10, Lot A.

But as far as the game, it's always good to get the first one, get the first win under your belt. I thought we got good contributions from all three units and we competed well. I thought the players were in good condition. I thought the conditioning was a big factor for us. That's a credit to their hard work, and we stepped up and made some big plays when we needed to throughout the game. Had a couple of tough calls there that didn't go our way that we had to overcome, but we did that. And the three turnovers and running the ball as effectively as we did and then coming back and passing the ball after we had run it, that was good, good balance that we struck there. So, it's good to get off to a good start, but tough week this week with Seattle, so we're going to have to turn the page pretty quickly here and move on. But, a lot of credit – really all the credit – goes to the players, and the coaches did a good job. It's a game that had some adjustments in it. Obviously, neither team had seen each other this year and so working out things during the game that come up or came up either on the sideline and players making adjustments to different looks that came up on the field and so forth. I thought that the players really handled that well, as did the staff.

On Friday, defensive end Myles Garrett said the Browns had not decided what they would do to take a stance on racial injustice and police brutality, but Garrett said they would do it together.
   
 But the Browns' actions Sunday in M&T; Bank Stadium sent a mixed message. The Browns remained in the locker room for the playing of "Lift Every Voice and Sing," the Black national anthem, then came out onto the sideline for the national anthem.
   
 The Baltimore Ravens stood in the end zone for the Black anthem, then moved to the sideline.
   
 "We didn't know about it, so we weren't able to come out for it," Garrett said of the Browns not coming out for the Black national anthem.
   
 Garrett, receiver KhaDarel Hodge and safety Ronnie Harrison knelt during the national anthem, as did multiple members of the Ravens. Browns receiver Odell Beckham Jr. took a knee in the corner of the end zone after the anthem.
   
 Garrett said kneeling was just a message.
   
 "No disrespect to anybody who served or anybody who's in law enforcement or is serving right now," he said. "Anybody who's served before that I've known, I don't think they've taken it as a disrespectful thing and it's not that. If we continue to do the same thing or we switch it up, that's something we'll worry about next week.
   
 "My decision to do that has no bearing on my game or it doesn't bear on my conscience, either. After that's done, I'm in game mode."
   
 CBS went on the air early for its regional broadcast in order to provide coverage of the anthems.
   
 Some members of the Browns locked arms -- including quarterback Baker Mayfield flanked by Larry Ogunjobi and Sheldon Richardson -- as the teams recognized issues raised by the Memorial Day death of George Floyd. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the protest of those causes in 2016.
   
 Among the Ravens who took a knee were running backs J.K. Dobbins and Mark Ingram, cornerback Anthony Averett, linebacker Malik Harrison, defensive tackle Justin Ellis and star defensive end Calais Campbell.
   
 "I'm going to respect all of my teammates' decisions," Mayfield said. "We talked about it, we had discussions and we're on the same page. We're in this together in showing solidarity to try and unite instead of divide. It doesn't matter what decision any of our teammates make, that's just what I personally said and the way I wanted to say it.
   
 The name I had on the back of my helmet, Julius Jones. A very sad story, a guy who's wrongly incarcerated in the state of Oklahoma. I tried to represent him today for "Justice for Julius." I hope I spread that message and I will continue to do so."
   
 As shown on ESPN, Beckham and Mayfield were among the Browns who came out for warmups wearing a black T-shirt that read #BeTheSolution with a Browns helmet beside the lettering. The message was the title of the team's social justice initiative launched by General Manager Andrew Berry in June.
   
 Berry is one of two Black GMs in the league this year, along with the Miami Dolphins' Chris Grier.
   
 The Browns also wore decals on the back of the helmets with the names of victims of racial violence and police brutality.
   
 The back of the shirt included names of Black victims who have become symbols in the fight to end systemic racism, including Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Emmitt Till, Elijah McClain, Kalief Browder, George Stinney, Stephon Clark, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice, who lived in Cleveland.
   
 Also listed were John Sanders, blinded in one eye when he was shot by law enforcement as he walked away from a Black Lives Matter protest in Cleveland on May 30, and Julius Jones, a Black man on death row in Oklahoma who alleges he was unjustly accused of murder. Mayfield is among the prominent athletes who have written letters to Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt in support of Jones' request for clemency.
   
 The names on the Browns' shirts were printed in white, with Black Lives Matter, Stop Hate, It Takes All Of Us and End Racism in orange.
   
 On Saturday, Mayfield posted a statement on Twitter and Instagram that he had reversed his decision to kneel for the national anthem.
   
 Mayfield wrote on social media that he believed that action, which he had pledged to take on June 13, would "only create more division or discussion about the gesture, rather than be a solution towards our country's problems."
   
 The quarterback's initial remarks came in the wake of Floyd's death as a former Minneapolis police officer knelt on the Black man's neck for nearly nine minutes. Mayfield said in his Instagram post that he realized he might lose fans over his stance.
   
 In Thursday's NFL season opener, the Houston Texans and defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs were booed when they gathered at midfield before kickoff, linked arms and asked for a "moment of silence dedicated to the ongoing fight for equality in our country," according to a league statement. A crowd of just under 16,000 was allowed in Arrowhead Stadium. The Texans declined to come out of the locker room for the national anthem or the Black national anthem.
   
 The Miami Dolphins said they would not take the field for the anthem on Sunday at New England and released a powerful video on Thursday in which white and Black players voiced their feelings on injustice on social media.
   
 In mid-August, Mayfield said he had no regrets about his decision to kneel during the anthem.
   
 "Right is right, and wrong is wrong. There's a human rights issue that's been going on for a long time, and I believe in that," Mayfield said then.
   
 New Browns coach Kevin Stefanski formed an 11-player social justice committee that includes Mayfield and Garrett.
   
 One of those wrinkles
   
 Stefanski said he would have a couple of wrinkles for the Ravens this week and one showed up in the first quarter when punter Jamie Gillan, a former rugby player, took the snap on fourth-and-four from the Browns 31 and ran with the ball, only to have it knocked from his hands by L.J. Fort. Anthony Levine recovered the fumble and returned it to the Browns 27. It eventually led to a Ravens field goal and a 10-0 lead.
   
 - George M. Thomas
   
 Kicking issues
   
 Kicker Austin Seibert got off to a rough start of the season on the Browns first scoring drive with the team looking to cut into the Ravens 10-0 lead. After a TD pass from Mayfield to tight end David Njoku, Seibert hit the upright on the extra point. Seibert made 31-of-35 extra points in his rookie season.
   
 He compounded the problem with 49 seconds left in the first half when he missed a 41-yard field goal wide right. The Browns do have kicker Cody Parkey on their practice squad.
   
 - George M. Thomas
   
 Ignominious start
   
 After what looked to be a promising start to an opening drive, Mayfield was victimized by a familiar foe from last season - the turnover. Only this time it came courtesy of outstanding play from Ravens defensive lineman Calais Campbell. Campbell, 6-foot-8, 300 pounds, dropped back in coverage on a third- and-10 and got his hand on a Mayfield pass and tipped it, allowing Ravens defensive back Marlon Humphrey to come up with the interception. Last year, Mayfield threw 21 interceptions.
   
 - George M. Thomas
   
 Inactives, lineup changes
   
 Center JC Tretter started his 49th consecutive game for the Browns despite undergoing knee surgery on Aug. 13, sitting out all training camp practices and being listed as questionable to face the Ravens.
   
 Browns players who were inactive are cornerback Greedy Williams (shoulder), linebacker Mack Wilson (knee), nickelback Kevin Johnson (liver), offensive tackle Chris Hubbard (ankle), rookie wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones and defensive end Joe Jackson.
   
 Terrance Mitchell started in place of Williams. Rookie third-round draft pick Jacob Phillips started in place of Wilson at weakside linebacker.
   
 Like Tretter, nickelback M.J. Stewart (hamstring) was active for the Browns after being listed as questionable.
   
 -- Nate Ulrich
   
 Extra points
   
 • Long snapper Charley Hughlett served as the Browns' game captain.
   
 • Cornerback Robert Jackson (finger) left the game in the third quarter but returned to the game.
   
 • Phillips (knee) left the game in the third quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Queensland police fear there will be revenge attacks following a deadly brawl in northern Brisbane between members of the African community.
 A man in his 20s died after the fight between two groups of about 20 people at playing fields in Zillmere on Sunday afternoon.
 Paramedics took 10 people to hospital suffering stab wounds and blunt force injuries after being hit with baseball bats.
 Detective Superintendent Tony Fleming says police are concerned some of the people involved won't cooperate with investigators and will take matters into their own hands.
 "It's a horrific, unacceptable attack in our society and I can only imagine that as a parent or a sibling that would cause angst in my mind if it was someone I loved," he told reporters on Monday.
 "But retribution is not going to solve the problem. We have seen that in societies around the world where it becomes tit for tat.
 "It doesn't end well for anyone."
 Earlier, officers appealed for calm after friends and families of those hurt in the melee clashed outside Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, where the victims were being treated.
 "None of that behaviour is helpful to those who've been injured and nor to others that are using the hospital," Det Supt Fleming said on Sunday.
 Police believe three carloads of people arrived at the park seeking "retribution" for another incident that happened in Brisbane's west on September 8.
 Knives and baseball bats were used and glass bottles were thrown.
 "It was a very confronting scene. It was dark, right on dusk," Queensland Ambulance Service medical director Stephen Rashford said.
 Dr Rashford said injured people were spread across a large area and emotions were running high when the team of 21 paramedics arrived.
 "A number of critically ill patients required intense treatment," he said.
 "Sadly, one of the victims despite extensive resuscitative efforts was unable to be saved and died at the scene."
 Det Supt Fleming said the people involved "appear to be outliers to the African community" and were "not supported generally by the community".
 "I think we have an uphill battle here," he said.
 Police believe a spike in the price of drugs may be linked to the attacks and continue to search for a number of people who fled the scene.

A perfect surprise drop for a quarantine summer, “folklore” is Swift’s best album — sorry, “Red” (2012) — and the prime example of why she’s one of the best songwriters in the game. The album’s focus on storytelling — characters, love triangles, longing, nostalgia, loss — makes it easy to get lost in. And the indie alternative vibe simultaneously feels like the perfect place for Swift and a foreign setting that she’s adventuring into. It all adds to make “folklore” an extremely versatile album — it’ll stand the test of seasons and settings.

It certainly was a memorable weekend for Putnam County football teams — all three that took the field won their season openers by decisive margins.
 Now comes the hard part, though. They have to sit and wait to see when, or if, they can play again.
 Nine counties in West Virginia are listed in either red (highest risk) or orange on the weekly COVID-19 risk factor map, including Putnam, meaning their high school teams can’t play games through Saturday night. Putnam currently stands in the orange category. A week ago, Putnam was at the yellow level, so its games went on last weekend.
 Like neighboring Kanawha County (whose schools didn’t even get to play their openers last weekend because it was at the orange level), Putnam’s numbers rose several days in a row before falling from 15.94 to 15.69 last Tuesday in the state’s daily COVID-19 metric that measures cases per 1,000 population on a rolling seven-day average. Counties under 10 are listed as yellow (can play games) and those over 10 are orange (can’t play games).
 If Putnam’s football programs have to bow out for a while, at least they did it in style.
 Poca traveled to the Northern Panhandle and captured a 34-6 victory at three- time defending Class A champion Wheeling Central on Saturday, Sept. 5, the day after Hurricane opened with a 21-9 win at Huntington and Buffalo took down visiting Ravenswood 21-6. Winfield, the county’s other school, couldn’t play its scheduled opener at Herbert Hoover because of Kanawha’s orange status.
 Dillon Taylor, Poca’s senior linebacker and leading tackler, said the uncertainty of when his team can play again has nagged at him in recent days.
 “It’s taken a toll on me,’’ Taylor said. “I try to put it in the back of my mind, but regardless I’m going to be ready for when we get back out there.’’
 The Dots may have more to lose than many teams that are currently sidelined around the state because they were again expected to contend for the Class AA title. Coach Seth Ramsey said he and his coaches have to walk a fine line in being honest with their team about the situation while also keeping their players motivated.

BB: Yeah, it does. It always does. That's one of the things that when you make mistakes that are unforced mistakes, it obviously just gives your opponents extra opportunities and free yards and that kind of thing. It's really not – I mean, we never want to do that. There were a couple of close calls on the penalties. Not sure what it looked like, they were very close. And that's football. You're going to get some of those and you're not going to get some of them. But I think it's the ones you're referring to – the false starts, the too many men on the field, the lining up offsides, illegal motion, all of those kind of unforced errors – you just can't afford. It just gives your opponents too many opportunities. So, we've obviously always harped on those, but the players did a great job of staying focused and concentrating. Nobody's been able to play 60 minutes of football this year, but they went out and did it and executed well at the end on both sides of the ball and in the kicking game. So that's, again, a real credit to the players. But, yeah, certainly playing penalty-free or minimal penalties – that is always one of our goals. Glad we were able to do that today. The game got a little chippy at times and we didn't have any retaliation or personal foul penalties. The guys kept their poise there in a couple of those situations near the end of the game.

An Indian Summer Finale: Can’t help falling in Love

Olympique Marseille earned a smash-and-grab 1-0 win at Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain after forward Florian Thauvin struck in the 31st minute of a pulsating though ill-tempered match at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. Littered with fouls throughout, the clash boiled over in the last minute of stoppage time with referee Jerome Brisard sending off five players after a full scale brawl broke out on the pitch.
 Paris Saint Germain's Neymar, Laywin Kurzawa and Leandro Paredes as well as Marseille's duo of Dario Benedetto and Jordan Amavi were given their marching orders after rival players threw punches and kicks at each other.
 But it did not bother Marseille manager Andre Villas-Boas after the 1993 European Cup winners celebrated their first league win against PSG since November 2011.
 "A tough and important win as well as a historic one," Villas-Boas told reporters after his side condemned last season's Champions League runners-up to a second successive defeat following a 1-0 opening day setback at Lens.
   
   
 "We struggled to cope with PSG's early pressure because they are very good at it, but we found a way to grind out a great victory. It wasn't pretty and we suffered."
 Thauvin scored against the run of play, steering in a Dimitri Payet free kick inside the near post from close range after the home side had come close through Marco Verratti and Neymar, who also missed a pair of chances in the second half.
 Visiting keeper Steve Mandanda pulled off several superb saves before both sides had a goal disallowed for offside as the pace and intensity went up a gear after the break.
 Angel Di Maria's effort for PSG was ruled out in the 62nd minute and Benedetto's scorcher was also scrapped two minutes later as Thauvin, who unleashed the initial shot, was marginally behind the last PSG defender.
 Missing several first-team regulars who had contracted the COVID-19 virus, PSG pressed hard in the closing stages but Marseille's rugged defence held firm.
 PSG sports director Leonardo, a former World Cup winner with Brazil, criticised the referee's actions.
 "A total of 14 cards were brandished and five of them were red, which means the match got out of control," Leonardo told the Telefoot television channel.
 "(Brisard) lost his head. He officiated the League Cup final but he doesn't have the experience for this kind of fixture."

Six-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton took a knee before the start of the Tuscan Grand Prix on Sunday with a message on his T-shirt declaring "Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor". The words "say her name" and a photograph of Taylor were on the back of Briton Hamilton's black shirt as he knelt with other drivers before the anthem as part of the sport's now-regular anti-racism stance.
 The Mercedes driver, the sport's only Black competitor who has previously worn a "Black Lives Matter" T-shirt in such occasions, won the race at Italy's Mugello circuit.
 He wore the Taylor shirt again on the podium as he celebrated victory.
 Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed by police officers who burst into her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, in March.
 One police officer involved was fired by the city's police department in June. Two other officers have been placed on administrative reassignment. No criminal charges have been filed against any of the three.
 U.S. Open tennis winner Naomi Osaka wore a face mask with Taylor's name on it as one of a series of masks she wore on her way to the title and Hamilton hailed the Japanese player's action.
 "It took me a long time to get that shirt," he told reporters afterwards.
 "I've been wanting to wear that and bring awareness to the fact that there's people there that have been killed on the street and there's someone that got killed in her own house. And those guys are still walking free.
 "We have to continue to raise awareness with it and Naomi has been doing amazing, so huge congratulations to her. I think she's an incredible inspiration with what she's done with her platform."
 Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said on Saturday Hamilton, who has been a prominent campaigner for diversity and racial equality, was free to make whatever anti-racism statement he wanted.

The company with exclusive commercial licensing rights of the Aboriginal flag is in discussions with a federal government agency over use of the design.
 WAM Clothing director Semele Moore confirmed the move to a Senate inquiry on Monday but remains tight-lipped about the details.
 Indigenous artist and copyright holder Harold Thomas designed the flag in 1971 and non-Indigenous company WAM Clothing owns the commercial licensing rights.
 "WAM has entered into discussions with the National Indigenous Australians Agency in relation to the acquisition of the copyright in the Aboriginal flag," Ms Moore said.
 "Those discussions are ongoing. Harold has specifically requested those discussions remain confidential."
 Ms Moore was unable to tell the inquiry how many companies have paid to use the flag design, or have been told to stop using it.
 "I don't have the information (with me) and no I don't intend to submit it," she said.
 Ms Moore also wouldn't say how long the licensing rights were in place for.
 The inquiry is looking at copyright and licensing arrangements for the Aboriginal flag.
 Australians can freely fly the flag but there are limitations to its use in other ways.
 The inquiry has also been told the copyright could be split so it can be used more widely.
 Copyright law expert Michael Green SC said the government could negotiate with Mr Thomas about splitting the copyright while keeping the current commercial rights in mind.
 "You can slice copyright in a number of ways," he said.
 "It would be possible for the Commonwealth to do something to create a licence in relation to reproducing the flag as a flag, or to broadcast images of the flag as a flag.
 "It entails a conversation that needs to be had with the owner, Mr Thomas, and to respect his wishes."
 Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt had offered to buy the rights to the flag, but this was rejected.
 The long-running issue has reignited after the AFL was unable to use the flag during its Indigenous round.
 The league did not strike an agreement with WAM Clothing, which has exclusive rights to reproduce it on garments.
 Mr Green said slicing up the rights could happen without creating a new category of copyright.
 "You can divide copyright by location and all manner of things in the Commonwealth," he said.
 Mr Wyatt has promised to reach a resolution that respects the wishes of the flag's artist as well as the rights of all Australians.
 Labor is also pursuing legislation that would compel the minister to negotiate with Mr Thomas.

Driveway cleaner
 If you have gasoline or motor oil stains on your driveway, you can use the kitty litter method to clean up the excess oil and then use a scrub broom and a solution of biodegradable Dawn dishwashing detergent and warm water to safely and effectively remove excess motor oil from the pavement.
 Oily skin
 Dawn makes a great facial cleanser for oily skin. A drop or two combined with warm water will do the trick.
 Paint and grease remover for hands
 Dawn combined with corn oil makes for the perfect paint or grease remover. Simply combine a little bit of both in your hands then rub it over affected areas. The corn oil and the dishwashing liquid both help to dissolve the grease and paint – yet leave skin soft, unlike harsher paint removers.
 Cleaning the kiddie pool
 Plastic wading pools can get very gunky, very fast. Dump the water, then scrub the pool with Dawn and a sponge. More potent cleaners like bleach will weaken and dry out the plastic in the sun.
 Multipurpose cleaner
 Merry Maids recommends using a drop of Dawn in water to clean ceramic tile and no-wax/linoleum floors. You can also use the spray on:
 • Bathroom and kitchen counters and sinks.
 • Woodwork, e.g., baseboards, shelves, and wainscoting. (Dry as you go–wood doesn’t like prolonged contact with water.)
 • Tubs and toilet seats.
 Laundry detergent and pre-stain treatment
 For oil-based stains such as lipstick, grease, butter, motor oil, cooking oil, and some pen inks, simply apply some Dawn dishwashing liquid directly to the stain and scrub with a small brush or toothbrush until the oil is removed, and then launder as usual.
 Non-toxic lubricant
 Sliding glass doors, door knobs, hinges etc. It lasts much longer than any aerosol type spray that I have tried. And it's non-toxic! It does a great job of cleaning the parts that it's lubricating as well!
 Sidewalk deicer
 For icy steps and sidewalks in freezing temperatures, mix 1 teaspoon of Dawn dishwashing liquid, 1 tablespoon of rubbing alcohol, and 1/2 gallon hot/warm water and pour over walkways. They won’t refreeze. No more salt eating at the concrete in your sidewalks
 Pool cleaning
 Squirt Dawn down the middle of the pool and all of the dirt, suntan lotion, etc. will move to the edges of the pool for easy clean up! AND it makes the pools sparkle.
 Eyeglass defogger
 Simply rub a small drop of Dawn on eyeglass lenses, and wipe clean. It will leave a very thin film that will prevent them from fogging up.
 Shower floors
 Cover greasy footprints on shower floors with a coating of Dawn; let sit overnight. Scrub away the gunk in the morning with a stiff brush.
 Aphid control on fruit trees
 Mix two tablespoons Dawn to a gallon of water and put in your sprayer. Try to get spray both sides of the leaves, branches and the tree trunks. Let sit for about 15 minutes and then rinse the trees THOROUGHLY!
 And finally
 Here’s a brilliant idea! Need a hostess gift when visiting friends and family this summer? Save this column and include it with a bottle of Blue Dawn! Talk about useful!

Parliament convenes today after a long period in what will be a shortened monsoon session which will last till October 1. While the pandemic has prevented the full functioning of many institutions, Parliament is the most important one and it is imperative that its functionaries meet with adequate precautions to discuss the many issues the country faces, and legislate on several pending laws. The very fact that Parliament is back in business is a positive step. The most important thing, despite the fact that there will be no Question Hour, is to ensure that this session is productive. There is far too much at stake for it to be frittered away in needless contention and disruptions. There are at 11 ordinances which the government is looking to push through, though once again the Opposition has expressed reservations about this form of legislation. The government must be clear on its Covid-19 strategy going forward, it must be transparent on the facts of China's incursions on the border and the talks between the two countries. It has to address an economy which is faltering and discuss mitigating measures over and above the ones already taken to get things back on track. The issue of migrant workers and the massive job losses are a matter of concern and must be addressed with an aim of finding solutions which preclude party affiliations. The draft Environmental Impact Assessment policy and the aftermath of natural disasters like floods in many parts of the country all merit the attention of the lawmakers. It can only be hoped that the session does not get derailed by controversial issues including the one surrounding the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput which has become highly politicised with many sections of the media and public becoming obsessed with the case. The Opposition has every right to raise matters of public good, national security, social welfare and point out the shortcomings on the part of the government. The government must act in a spirit of accommodation and respond in a comprehensive and mature manner. Given the crises that India faces on many fronts, there is really no time to lose. Constructive engagement is the only way forward and Parliament must use the limited time available to it to let all points of view be heard and find solutions for the greater common good.

 The flames up and down the West Coast have destroyed neighborhoods, leaving nothing but charred rubble and burned-out cars, forced tens of thousands to flee and cast a shroud of smoke that has given Seattle, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, some of the worst air quality in the world.
 The smoke filled the air with an acrid metallic smell like pennies and spread to nearby states. While making it difficult to breathe, it helped firefighters by blocking the sun and turning the weather cooler as they tried to get a handle on the blazes, which were slowing in some places.

Parliament convenes today after a long period in what will be a shortened monsoon session which will last till October 1. While the pandemic has prevented the full functioning of many institutions, Parliament is the most important one and it is imperative that its functionaries meet with adequate precautions to discuss the many issues the country faces, and legislate on several pending laws. The very fact that Parliament is back in business is a positive step.
 The most important thing, despite the fact that there will be no Question Hour, is to ensure that this session is productive. There is far too much at stake for it to be frittered away in needless contention and disruptions. There are at 11 ordinances which the government is looking to push through, though once again the Opposition has expressed reservations about this form of legislation. The government must be clear on its Covid-19 strategy going forward, it must be transparent on the facts of China's incursions on the border and the talks between the two countries. It has to address an economy which is faltering and discuss mitigating measures over and above the ones already taken to get things back on track. The issue of migrant workers and the massive job losses are a matter of concern and must be addressed with an aim of finding solutions which preclude party affiliations. The draft Environmental Impact Assessment policy and the aftermath of natural disasters like floods in many parts of the country all merit the attention of the lawmakers.
 It can only be hoped that the session does not get derailed by controversial issues including the one surrounding the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput which has become highly politicised with many sections of the media and public becoming obsessed with the case. The Opposition has every right to raise matters of public good, national security, social welfare and point out the shortcomings on the part of the government. The government must act in a spirit of accommodation and respond in a comprehensive and mature manner. Given the crises that India faces on many fronts, there is really no time to lose. Constructive engagement is the only way forward and Parliament must use the limited time available to it to let all points of view be heard and find solutions for the greater common good.

It’s pretty insane how easy it seems to be for Jepsen to craft songs (she’s got about 200 of them in a vault somewhere). And the fact of the matter is that she doesn’t have a bad one. But we can only relisten to her discography so much before we long for something new. Following “Dedicated” (2019) last summer, “Side B” comes just when we need it. It’s refreshing bedroom pop that’s perfect for late night walks and silly singing in the mirror (“Summer Love” and “Fake Mona Lisa” immediately come to mind).

"Just about what we had to do. I think it was new for every team in the league or college, call it with the virtual meetings in the spring and coming in and starting with virtual meetings again, before we can get into building and, you know, all of the COVID stuff we've had to deal with. But I think the culture around here, as always, control what you can control and all the other stuff it is what it is. I think that quickly became what we talked about. No one complained about having to get tested or about having to wear a mask or any of that. We just locked in on what we can control and what was going on during training camp, each day trying to get better. Trying to lock in on what the coaches have for us. Like, that's what we discussed around here and I'm sure every team talked about that and you know I don't know what every team did, but I would say for us, that's what has helped us prepare to be out there for game one and we just got to continue to do those things as we go on a really tough challenge next week ago to Seattle."

 Burnham said that by and large, the district’s most vexing problem is in persuading families to keep their children home for at least 24 hours of close monitoring if any possible symptoms of COVID-19 develop in the household. An adult may become sick and expose a child who develops asymptomatic infection; the child then carries the virus into a school where it can spread rapidly.

JASPER, Ala. (WBRC) - The city of Jasper is stepping up it’s mask enforcement policy by issuing tickets for not wearing a mask.“Everybody has been fairly compliant when we ask them," Jasper Pickers Owner Greg Faulkner said. “Most people have been very comfortable with that. We’ve had a few, they tell us that they have a medical condition and we just say 'okay, hope you stay safe."Masks are required in Faulkner’s store, Jasper Pickers, because of the statewide mandate. Faulkner said he does his best to enforce it.“We make announcements periodically and ask everyone to make sure they stay six feet apart and wear masks,” Faulkner said.But, Jasper Mayor David O' Mary said some people are not adhering to the mask mandate. He gave a weekly update on the city website and addressed it. "We have had people that have been very defiant with our police officers about the mask order,“ Mayor O’ Mary said. “Defiant to the point of telling our officers to go fly a kite and paying our officers no attention.”Mayor O' Mary said Jasper police will be ticketing those who refuse to wear a mask.“The city of Jasper has no desire to put a hardship on you and cost you money, but if you do elect to be defiant of the law, then we will have no choice but to give you a citation," O' Mary said.Mayor O' Mary said that citation could cost up to $500. He said police will only issue tickets if a person refuses after being asked first by the officer.“In small town Alabama, people are still going to try and ignore it," resident Josh Nation said. “It’ll just depend on how serious they are about enforcing it.”“I don’t think it is going to matter," Faulkner said. “I mean as much as everybody is wearing these everywhere, if they aren’t going to wear it then they aren’t going to wear it.”The statewide mask mandate is set to be re- evaluated on October 2nd where it could be extended.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

A 29-year-old man in Bhopal was booked by the Shyamla Hills police station on Sunday for throwing a street dog in the upper lake after a video clip of the incident went viral on social media triggering outrage in Bhopal and elsewhere with demands for his arrest.
 The video clip suggests it was shot during late evening or night hours at any point near the railing erected along upper lake at Boat club in Shyamla Hills area in Bhopal. The man scoops up the dog in his arms and then flings him across the railing into the river. Afterwards, he is seen smiling for the video.
 It is not known to police as to who shot the video and if the dog was dead or alive. The friends of the accused told police that the video was an old one.
 The accused was identified as Salman Khan, a resident of Tila Jamalpura area in Bhopal city, is on the run and has a history of violence against animals.
 An FIR was filed against him on Sunday evening under section 429 (Committing mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animal of the value of fifty rupees or upwards) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act on a complaint lodged by Sunita Joshi, a resident of Shyamla Hills.
 Bhopal deputy inspector general (DIG) of police Irshad Wali said, "In the viral video the man was seen throwing a street dog in the upper lake and smiling. Police identified the man as Salman Khan who works in a photo studio."
 The DIG said efforts are on to nab the accused.
 Shyamla Hills police station in charge Tarun Rathi said, "The date when the accused indulged in the crime is yet to be known. However, when a police team questioned his friends they said it was a very old video as far as they had knowledge about it. However, police couldn't know immediately if the dog was dead or alive and who shot the act in the video."
 While social media was agog with reactions from people who demanded severe action against the accused, a life coach, Manoj Gaur said: "Vicious act, this man threw a dog who was alive into the upper lake of Bhopal. He deserves a penal action as per law."
 A student in Bhopal Asma Khan who lodged a complaint with Bhopal district collector Avinash Lavaniya against the accused demanded strict action against him and also the man who shot the video.

The likes of Forrest Fenn won’t come our way again anytime soon.
 His life, whether flying combat missions in Vietnam, running art galleries or devising a treasure hunt, was spent at full throttle until his death last week at 90.
 As such, his time spent on Earth was not without controversy. He had huge fans and fierce critics — whether about how he collected artifacts or concerning the treasure hunt that caught the world’s attention.
 Sparked by the desire to leave a legacy after a cancer diagnosis, Fenn came up with the idea of a treasure hunt. He told the world that somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, he had left a chest full of coins and antiquities. In his 2010 memoir, _The Thrill of the_ _Chase_ , he laid out clues.
 Tens of thousands of treasure-seekers took up the chase, following an age-old human urge to discover hidden riches. In the West, with the tales of the Lost Dutchman Mine in Arizona or Apache Chief Victorio’s treasure in New Mexico, the payoff is always around the bend. Santa Fe was the natural setting from which to launch the hunt.
 Fenn took that human urge to seek out gold and sent treasure-seekers off on the chase. He wanted people out of the house, into the outdoors and seeking adventure, not sitting on the couch watching television or staring at a computer screen.
 The search was not without risk — people died looking for the chest and others became lost and had to be rescued. Many said the search should have been suspended.
 It was not, and the people caught up in the chase kept looking, with unanticipated positive side effects. Seekers forged bonds, with treasure- loving campers gathering at Hyde Memorial State Park for meetings. The quest captured the imagination of millions, spawning television news programs, articles and documentary films. More treasure-seekers followed.
 Richard Lamb of Dallas wrote to _The_ _New Mexican_ about his own experience seeking treasure, saying this: “I discovered his treasure poem online and got caught up in some recreational hunting in New Mexico. He was a driving force that initially took me to a state park in New Mexico three years ago. I was so impressed by the scenery, friendly park staff and wildlife, I returned and got an annual camping pass. … Forrest Fenn led me to New Mexico.”
 In 2020, not long before Fenn’s death, he announced the treasure chest had been found in Wyoming. The hunt was over. Yet another wrinkle remained.
 The finder asked for anonymity, causing many to speculate that the treasure remained hidden. Photographs were eventually produced, but the hunt did not have a clean ending — at least not for skeptics.
 For the rest of the world, Fenn’s advice to grab life and get off the couch is valuable beyond a treasure hunt. Treasure may be elusive, but joy in the great outdoors is constant. That’s quite a legacy.
