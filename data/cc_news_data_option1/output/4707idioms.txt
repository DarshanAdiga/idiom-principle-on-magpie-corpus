While they were reeling from the hammering, they became the first Super League team to be struck down with coronavirus but it was during this period that the penny seemed to drop.
 Hull were going to have to work a hell of a lot harder than they were doing and short-term goals took precedence over long-term ones as they knuckled down in an attempt to rescue the season and save face.
 Performances and results came, but FC struggled for consistency as the Black and Whites, still feeling the after-effects of the virus, were forced to contend with the sort of fixture list that gave players and head coaches nightmares, playing six games coming in less than four weeks.

Most of the trees grew just fine. One, however, never seemed to have much vigor, and it did not keep up with the other trees. About five years after I moved in — about eight years after the tree was planted — it uprooted and fell over. That is when I discovered that the burlap was still intact and almost all of the tree’s roots were still confined within the bag.

CANTON — Following discussions over village financial support of the Canton Chamber of Commerce this fall, town officials are also considering taxpayer return on investment for Chamber funding.
 Now five months into the village’s 2020-21 fiscal year, village trustees are still gauging whether the full amount of budgeted Chamber funding, $6,500, should be allocated this year. The town earmarked $5,500 for the Chamber in its 2020 budget, and during its regular November meeting last week, the town council requested additional documentation of Chamber activity, employee hours, an annual budget and any reserve funds.
 The town’s 2021 budget, which passed last week, does not include funding specifically marked for the Canton Chamber.
 “In asking for a report of Chamber activities, what we keep getting is a list of the events, a list of the events that have been canceled,” Councilmember Timothy J. Danehy said. “That’s made it a little difficult for us to know behind the scenes what has been going on.”
 Chamber treasurer John J. Gray Jr., of Gray & Gray and Associates CPA, has recused himself from the ongoing conversation, as he also provides auditing services for the town. Village trustees heard from Chamber board members Benjamin R. Dixon and Carol J. Spadaccini in September, and Chamber Executive Director Tammy M. Mackin spoke to town council last week.
 Ms. Mackin, who started as executive director in 2019, said she thought the part-time position was out of her “wheel house” until she looked into what a local Chamber of Commerce does. As she sees it, the Canton Chamber is a “vital advocate” for local businesses, not an “economic development arm for the town or village.”
 “It greatly disappoints me that a small portion of tax dollars will no longer be designated towards the advocacy of our existing small businesses, especially in a time when our local small businesses are struggling more than ever,” Ms. Mackin said.
 The concern from municipal officials is that the Chamber has done little for local businesses during peaks of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Danehy said some of what Ms. Mackin presented was new information to town council — Ms. Mackin said she personally delivered hand sanitizer and public health posters to Chamber members this spring — but questions linger about the Chamber’s operating budget and other efforts to support the business community.
 Councilmember Karin S. Blackburn serves as center director of Northern Area Health Education Center, a Canton Chamber member, and said the organization did not hear from the Chamber during the height of the pandemic.
 Ms. Mackin said emails were sent to its members, and she reiterated that she hand delivered sanitizer and posters to member businesses.
 Since March 12, the Canton Chamber’s Facebook page has posted event cancellations, a March 18 notice of the Chamber office closure, a few reposts of local curbside offerings and links to the Small Business Administration website and St. Lawrence County Chamber of Commerce virtual events.
 The Chamber is now promoting the annual storefront decorating contest for the holidays.
 Previously located in the basement of the municipal building, 60 Main St., the Chamber office moved to the offices of Gray & Gray Associates CPA at 1 Main St. earlier this month. The office is not currently open to public visits, and those interested in submitting an announcement or sending correspondence should mail to Canton Chamber of Commerce, P.O. Box 369, Canton, NY 13617, or email cantonchamberny@gmail.com.
 The Chamber launched an online survey in September designed to identify the needs of member businesses. The 10-question survey is posted to the Chamber’s Facebook page and the Chamber contact page on the municipal website.

DETROIT — Erica Hill’s best friend weighs only 13 pounds, but he can be a terror of a terrier.
 That’s why Hill, who typically works a 16-hour day in her job with the City of Detroit, admits she could not do the work and hold onto the greatest joy of her life — her 2-year-old pup, Kash — if it weren’t for dog day care services.
 “I am single so if it were not for Canine to Five, Kash would take over my house,” Hill said of the day care and boarding center in Detroit. “He’s a very active Yorkie. There, he can socialize with other dogs and it makes my life easier to know that he’s safe and he’s well-taken care of.”
 The feeling is mutual. Dog day care owners say those front-line workers helped save their businesses when the coronavirus pandemic hit and their other customers started working from home, keeping Fido at their side instead of in day care. Then, as business travel dissipated, so did dog boarding.
 Now these businesses are on the mend as remote workers seek a break from their pup’s barking in the background or want them groomed again and are returning to dog day care. Also helping is the swell of puppy adoptions since mid-March.
 “I feel like a pandemic puppy was one of 2020’s hottest new accessories,” said Liz Blondy, owner of Canine to Five. “Our puppy program numbers are good, not great, because there’s still a large part of the population not leaving the house, but overall puppy numbers are up in both locations.”
 Some dog day care business owners said they don’t expect a full recovery in their revenue until there is a COVID-19 vaccine. At that time, they expect that many workers will head back to the office and business travel might resume.
 But that could be a long dry spell considering the 90-day drought the businesses endured. In early March, most Michigan businesses started shutting down and workers were told to work remotely.
 That meant many dogs stopped coming to day care. Blondy had to lay off 90% of her staff across her two locations: one in midtown Detroit and another in Ferndale.
 “We went from 98 employees to three working at each location,” Blondy said.
 But she couldn’t just turn off the lights. By offering boarding services, there was always at least one dog there, so she stayed open. It was a blessing for many front-line workers. One nurse would board her dog overnight while she worked that shift at a hospital, picking up her pet in the morning, Blondy said.
 Erica Hill, who ran the COVID-19 testing site at the Michigan state fairgrounds during that time, said she’s been using Canine to Five for various services, including dog grooming, for 15 years. She took her previous cocker spaniel there.
 “Now I am working for the Department of Elections. I go into the office every day at 7 a.m. and I pick up Kash at Canine at 8 p.m.,” Hill said. “Then I come back to work until 11 p.m.”
 She spends about $160 a week on day care for Kash, but he’s worth it, she said.
 “Every day I come to pick him up, he runs down the hall and acts like he hasn’t seen me in months even though it’s only been hours,” Hill said. “He’s just a great joy. He’s my child.”
 Doggie in the Window in Berkley has seen its revenue drop off too this year. Its total business is off by about 80% since March 16, said Todd Luczak, who owns the business with his wife, Wendy Luczak.
 The Luczaks had to cut the staff of 45 down to 10 people earlier this year, he said. They did what they could to keep people employed such as asking one full-time employee to switch to a night job working with the maintenance technician to help with repairs and cleaning the building. They have brought back 23 people to date, he said.
 Fortunately, their business is near Beaumont Hospital, so many clients are medical professionals. Those essential workers continued to bring in their dogs for day care. Todd Luczak credits that as saving the business when boarding dried up.
 One of those essential workers was Stephanie Goggin, a resident physician at Beaumont, whose 3-year-old golden retriever, Skelli, went to Doggie in the Window almost every day. Goggin was tapped to work grueling hours March through May, sometimes three 12-hour overnight shifts in a row, she said.
 “It was extremely unpredictable, which is why Doggie in the Window was crucial,” Goggin said. “I couldn’t have lined up a sitter because my schedule was changing every single day. If they had closed, I would have been up a creek without a paddle.”
 She bought an unlimited monthly pass for $500. With that, if her dog needed to stay overnight, it was only $10 compared with the normal $33, “so when I worked the overnights she had someplace safe to stay.”
 Goggin has recently adopted a puppy, Zimmi, who will eventually join Skelli in day care.
 Likewise, Beth Bascom relied on the day care for her 2 _1/2_ -year-old dog, Ozzie, a rambunctious boy who likes to chew up the molding on her 100-year-old Royal Oak home. So he needed supervision.
 But Bascom is an emergency room physician at Ascension St. John Hospital in Detroit who works long hours. Her adult son, who lives with her in Royal Oak, could not watch Ozzie while she worked because he has a demanding job, too.
 “When we had the full shutdown in March, several of my colleagues were ill with the virus so I ended up picking up extra shifts. I can’t describe to you how stressful that period of time was,” Bascom said. “I was terrified Doggie in the Window was going to shut down. I don’t know how they keep that place going, but I can’t tell you how happy I was to have them open during that time.”
 Wendy and Todd Luczak said staying open went beyond revenue streams.
 “The financial side of my brain said it would have been better to shut down, but it’s not always about the money, it’s the service we can provide,” Todd said. “It’s a very rewarding business to be in. We’ll be out and about in town and run into a client who remarks about what we did for their dog.”
 Doggie in the Window stayed open seven days a week. It costs $26.50 a day for a dog in day care, half of that for each additional dog. Boarding is $33 a night for one dog, $55 for two.
 Wendy took photos with signs next to the client’s dogs during the height of the pandemic’s first wave to show the essential workers how much they appreciated them.
 “That’s all it was every day. They’d bring them in for day care and they would end up keeping the dog overnight boarding because they had to work,” Wendy said. “I don’t know what people would have done without it.”
 Or what Doggie in the Window would have done without them. Todd Luczak has a day job beyond co-owning Doggie in the Window. He knows firsthand that business travel remains depressed, keeping the demand for boarding down.
 “I work in the auto industry, for a supplier, and we’d travel to Mexico every other month and there are no plans to travel down there,” Luczak said.
 There has been a slight uptick in boarding recently as some people started to do more personal travel on the weekends. But business is still lagging.
 “Every holiday we’re usually booked up,” said Wendy Luczak. “On Memorial Day, we had 16 dogs and we should have had a lot more than that. But we got a boost over the Fourth of July. I don’t know what Thanksgiving or Christmas is going to bring.”
 Todd Luczak said they are boarding about 10 dogs a night now compared with about 40 this time last year. On the weekends, they board 40 to 60, whereas it used to be 80 to 100 dogs.
 Dog day care volume is down, too, by at least 20% compared with last year, he said. The facility is licensed to have 350 dogs a day in day care, but it is averaging about 130 dogs a day. Still, at the height of the pandemic’s first wave this spring, it had dropped to a low of about 25 dogs a day.
 Wendy Luczak said she has been doing evaluations of new dogs to join day care nearly every day because people have been adopting dogs and puppies during the pandemic.
 “Yesterday we had 10 dogs that we haven’t seen in seven months,” she said. “We get messages from the staff, ‘Kibbitz is here today!’ because they haven’t seen him in so long. Then they say, ‘I hope he’s back tomorrow.’”

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — Hurricane Iota battered Nicaragua's Caribbean coast and flooded some stretches of neighboring Honduras that were still under water from Hurricane Eta two weeks earlier, leaving authorities struggling to assess damage after communications were knocked out in some areas.
 By late Tuesday, Iota had diminished to a tropical storm and was moving inland over northern Nicaragua and southern Honduras, but forecasters warned that its heavy rains still posed a threat of flooding and mudslides. It had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was spinning westward at 12 mph (19 kph).
 The storm passed about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south-southwest of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, where rivers were rising and rain was expected to intensify. In mountainous Tegucigalpa, residents of low-lying, flood-prone areas were being evacuated in anticipation of Iota’s rains, as were residents of hillside neighborhoods vulnerable to landslides.
 Along Honduras’ remote eastern coast, people had to leave damaged and flooding homes.
 “What affected us most here was the flooding. The Barra Patuca sector has been flooded for the last two weeks," said Teonela Paisano Wood, mayor of the Honduran town of Brus Laguna. “We are in danger if it keeps raining.”
 Mirna Wood, vice president of the Miskito ethnic group in Honduras’ far east Gracias a Dios region, was in Tegucigalpa collecting donations for her community ravaged by Eta when Iota hit.

 While the Wildcats’ fifth league victory assured them a coveted spot in the Class 6A Division II playoffs that begin during the second week of December, the to-do list at Temple (7-1, 5-0 District 12-6A) is far from filled out, even with that goal checked off.

Gatesville was playing just its second game and hadn’t practiced in eight days because of a coronavirus outbreak on campus. Still, the Lady Hornets (0-2) made a late run to almost catch the Lady Tigers (2-2).
 “This was our problem last year in that we waited too long to start playing,” Lady Hornets coach Ryan Ochesky said. “The girls played hard and did what they were supposed to do. When we’re on our game defensively, we’re a tough team.”
 Belton carried a 31-22 lead into the fourth, before Gatesville began to make a move. The Lady Hornets outscored the Lady Tigers 6-1 through the first 5 minutes of the quarter, with a pair of buckets from Cade Smalley and two free throws by Allaiya Jones closing the gap to 32-28. Jones later connected on a short jumper to make it a two-point game with 28 seconds left.
 Points were hard to come by for the Lady Tigers, but McKenna Maddux calmly hit a pair of free throws with 9 seconds left to provide a much-needed four-point cushion. Jones came back with another layup before the buzzer to account for the final margin.
 “McKenna’s free throws at the end made things a little less stressful,” Gomez said.
 It was Gatesville that got off to a hot start for a 10-5 lead on the strength of two Jenna Coward buckets, a Jones 3-pointer and three free throws from Caitlyn Chacon.
 Belton heated up in the final 2:22 of the first quarter with eight consecutive points on baskets from Anna Beamesderfer, Karina Foster, Ayanna Jones and Lillian Small to put the Lady Tigers ahead 13-10.
 Belton kept that momentum going into halftime by outscoring Gatesville 9-2 in the second quarter, with buckets from four players — Nylah Modeste, Beamesderfer, Shelby Foster and Aemanie Jones — giving the Lady Tigers a 22-12 lead by halftime.
 The Lady Hornets began to get going again to start the second half, but Belton matched them. A Beamesderfer 3 along with points from Ayanna Jones, Modeste and Campbell Burnet pushed the Lady Tigers’ advantage to 31-19, before Smalley and Shaylie Smart combined for three free throws for Gatesville to make it a nine-point gap going to the fourth.
 Nine Lady Tigers got in the scoring column, with Beamesderfer and Ayanna Jones leading the balanced attack with seven points apiece. Allaiya Jones paced Gatesville with 15.
 “I was excited about our offensive and defensive rebounds,” Gomez said. “The turnovers were better than what we’ve had.”

The chassis is stiffer, and there are some updated suspension parts, but aside from a 12-mm-wider track, a slightly longer wheelbase, and an additional inch in overall length, the new Civic's dimensions are almost identical to the tenth-generation. It's hard to tell just from looking at it, though, as the new design has a vastly improved stance. The way it sits over the wheels doesn't give away the front-wheel-drive nature of the car. It's substantial in a way the tenth-generation wasn't.
 Honda says the 2022 Civic will hit dealers in late spring 2021 with a familiar lineup--the sedan will come first, followed by the hatchback, Si, and eventually, a new Type R. One notable omission from the lineup is a manual- transmission base sedan. Calhoun said the take-rate for the manual was higher on the hatchback than the sedan, so the hatchback will be the only one to offer three pedals on base-model drivetrains. Pressed for details on the Si and the Type R, Pulley wouldn't give away much, but he did confirm that both sport models would be manual-only. On the other side of the spectrum, an EV version is not currently in the works, but expect to see a hybrid eventually.

GULFPORT, Miss. (WLOX) - Flooding has been a major problem for businesses along Highway 49 and 18th Street in Gulfport. With the city’s efforts to fix the problem, bids submitted back in October that were denied are now back to square one.“I don’t know. We keep hearing things are going to get done, things are going to get done, and nothing,” Cardinal Flowers owner William Brewer.Brewer said most of the problem started when the median was built in downtown, causing the poor drainage to turn into flooding.“We got to the point where we have always if something comes in, we would just pick everything up off the floor," Brewer said. “Make sure the bottom cabinets are empty and we try to keep it done pretty much daily basis as much as we can. Our goal is three feet off the floor.”When the city solicited bids from contractors to correct the ongoing issue, all three were rejected because they didn’t meet the Mississippi Development Authority and/or HUD requirements. This delay caused more frustration for Brewer, but he said this is the most effort he has seen in the past 20 years.“They are doing something it’s just an extremely slow process because I already know they’ve gotten bids in several times and it seems like it’s just doesn’t go anywhere. So I’m glad they’re still at least in the works with it,” Brewer said.The flood mitigation project will be completely funded by MDA, and city officials say the timetable for the work will not be determined until a bid is awarded. The city said the bid awarded will be to the lowest and best bid submitted.Copyright 2020 WLOX. All rights reserved.

SARANAC LAKE — The Saranac Waterfront Lodge opened its doors Monday.
 On Tuesday, the hotel started a soft opening period, giving guests their first look at its guestrooms, all-day restaurant, lobby fireplace, and waterfront meeting and event space. Rates start at $192 a night and go up to $496 a night.
 The four-story, 93-room independent boutique hotel on the shore of Lake Flower’s Pontiac Bay has been in the works for several years now, but it will not be able to open fully until 2021, and some amenities rely on lower COVID-19 restrictions.
 Additional amenities opening in 2021 include two more food and beverage venues, an indoor heated pool and hot tub, lakeside fire pit, private marina with lake access and 24 boat slips.
 “We are thrilled to open our doors to guests for the first time today and give travelers a sneak peek of our beautiful hotel, which provides a perfect home base from which to explore the Adirondacks,” Saranac Waterfront Lodge Managing Director Anura Dewapura said. “We look forward to welcoming visitors for the holiday season, the Saranac Lake Winter Carnival and more as we enter into 2021, and hope that our guests this fall and winter will come back to visit us this spring and summer following our official grand opening.”
 Guests who stay at the hotel during the months of November through January will also be invited to return for the hotel’s official grand opening in spring 2021, with a 20% discount on the best available rate and a $25 food and beverage credit.
 Designed by the Baskervill architectural engineering firm and inspired by its natural surroundings, a press release from the Saranac Waterfront Lodge’s marketing company describes it as “the epitome of ‘lake meets mountain’ style,” saying the outdoors is woven into every aspect of the hotel. It describes this as an “Adirondack Modern” aesthetic.
 The color scheme is natural, with forest green and deep navy blue accents, and plaid used throughout. The artwork pays homage to the surrounding flora and fauna of the area. A large patio overlooks Lake Flower.
 Most guest rooms average 335 square feet and are said to accentuate the views of the surrounding lake, mountains and town.

The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said Tuesday the American economy has a "long way to go" before it returns to pre-pandemic levels.
 Powell warned the "next few months may be very challenging." He said the Fed is committed to supporting a recovery.
 Stocks that stormed higher this month on hopes that a vaccine or two may get the global economy back to normal next year receded.
 Extra unemployment benefits that helped to support U.S. consumer spending have expired. Progress on a possible new aid plan in Congress is slow.
 "The concern is that people will lose confidence in efforts to control the pandemic," said the Fed's Powell. "We're seeing signs of that already."
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell from a record, down 0.6% to 29,783.35. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% to 11,899.34.

Constantine Village Council on Monday voted a second time against signing an application for a permit from Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to relocate water lines under the U.S. 131 bridge.
   
 The relocation is the first step for a proposed MDOT rehabilitation of the bridge.
   
 Council members had voted against signing the application at the previous council meeting.
   
 Trustees mentioned concerns with semi-trucks in the left turning lane and room for golf carts on the bridge.
   
 Council president Gary Mathers said the council needs more time to study MDOT blueprints for the project.
   
 On Feb. 4, representatives from MDOT held a two-hour open house to explain a proposed 2021 project on the U.S. 131 business loop. At that meeting, project engineer Corey Hackworth said MDOT plans to perform a "road diet," a bridge rehabilitation and deck replacement on the Washington Street bridge on the south end of the village in 2021, road surface treatment and water main replacement under the bridge and some chip- and-seal work.
   
 A "road diet" is the conversation of a four-lane highway to a three-lane road made up of two through lanes and a center turning lane.
   
 Federal Highway Administration states, from before-and-after studies, it is an inexpensitve way to reduce vehicle collisions and make roads more bike- and pedestrian-friendly.
   
 More than a dozen engineers and MDOT officials with schematics were present at the open house to answer questions.
   
 On Nov. 11, Hackworth spoke online to the council at its virtual meeting.
   
 "We will have the same level of service, optimization and safety, with a $1.5 million savings, and the bridge will be aesthetically pleasing with four 'bump outs' (sections protruding outward from bridge) and lighting," Hackworth said.
   
 Village manager Mark Honeysett said MDOT had requested the EGLE application to relocate water lines be signed by Dec.7, the same date as the next council meeting.
   
 Hackworth told the council that not signing the application by then "will put the project back one year."
   
 Other news from the council meeting:
       The newly elected council officially takes office Nov. 20. At that point, terms of office for clerk and treasurer expire and the council must appoint people to serve in those offices. Jan Rimer, current treasurer, said she would like to continue to serve. Honeysett said since Myra Mathers, the current clerk, was elected to a trustee position and the council must find a successor.   Village attorney Howard Bush told the council a proposed towing business, at 230 N. Washington St., did conforms to commercial zoning, but the impound lot does not.

BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO could pay a heavy price for leaving Afghanistan too early, its chief warned Tuesday after a U.S. official said President Donald Trump is expected to withdraw a significant number of American troops from the conflict-ravaged country in the coming weeks.NATO has fewer than 12,000 troops from dozens of nations in Afghanistan helping to train and advise the country’s national security forces. More than half are not U.S. troops, but the 30-nation alliance relies heavily on the United States for transport, air support, logistics and other assistance. It’s unlikely that NATO could even wind down its operation without U.S. help.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, wearing a face mask stands next to Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis before their meeting in Athens on Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020. Stoltenberg warns there may be consequences from a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan.“We now face a difficult decision. We have been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and no NATO ally wants to stay any longer than necessary. But at the same time, the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement Tuesday.He said Afghanistan still “risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands. And ISIS (Islamic State) could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq.”The U.S. decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in war zones. The expected plans would cut U.S. troop numbers almost in half by Jan. 15, leaving 2,500 troops in Afghanistan.U.S. officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawal and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders.NATO took charge of the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003, two years after a U.S-led coalition ousted the Taliban for harboring former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. In 2014, it began to train and advise Afghan security forces, but has gradually pulled troops out in line with a U.S.-brokered peace deal.Stoltenberg said that “even with further U.S. reductions, NATO will continue its mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. We are also committed to funding them through 2024.”NATO’s security operation in Afghanistan is its biggest and most ambitious undertaking ever. It was launched after the military alliance activated its mutual defense clause — known as Article 5 — for the first time, mobilizing all the allies in support of the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.“Hundreds of thousands of troops from Europe and beyond have stood shoulder to shoulder with American troops in Afghanistan, and over 1,000 of them have paid the ultimate price,” Stoltenberg said.“We went into Afghanistan together. And when the time is right, we should leave together in a coordinated and orderly way. I count on all NATO allies to live up to this commitment, for our own security,” he said.The United States is by far NATO’s biggest and most influential ally. It spends more on defense than all the other countries combined. But Trump’s term in office has marked a particularly tumultuous time for the organization. He has routinely berated other leaders for not spending enough on defense, and has pulled out of security agreements that European allies and Canada consider important for their security, such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Open Skies aerial surveillance pact.French President Emmanuel Macron said last year that NATO was suffering from “brain death,” in part due to a lack of U.S. leadership.Stoltenberg has refrained from publicly criticizing Trump or his decisions since Trump came to power in 2016.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

WATERTOWN — Toys for Tots of Jefferson County, once in danger of teetering into the void of winter, has been revived with the help of two childhood friends who are working to make sure needy children have their own Christmases to remember.
 This is the second year for Michelle Tinsley serving as coordinator of the Jefferson County Toys for Tots program, which is run by the United States Marine Corps Reserve.
 The nonprofit program distributes toys to children whose parents cannot afford to buy them gifts for Christmas. It was founded in 1947 by reservist Maj. Bill Hendricks and his wife, Diane, who collected and distributed 5,000 toys in the Los Angeles area in 1947.
 Today, local campaigns are conducted annually in over 800 communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Toy collection campaigns in communities begin in October and last until mid to late December.
 In 2018, Jefferson County Toys for Tots organizers had to go into Plan B mode for the holiday season after a pair who coordinated the program the previous couple of years, Gerry and Gina Chambers, could no longer continue their work because of health and personal reasons. A replacement team could not be found in time. That left members of the Jefferson Breakfast Kiwanis Club scrambling to come up with a plan. The local club has a long tradition of involvement with Toys for Tots and was able to make something work in 2018 with the help of local businesses and donors, but it wasn’t under the Toys for Tots banner.
 Area coordinators must go through some stringent training through the U.S. Marine Toys for Tots before they can coordinate local programs.
 In late 2018, Michelle Tinsley saw the bind that the local Toys for Tots unit was having. She and her husband, William Tinsley, were just coming off 25 years of running their family-owned Apollo Restaurant, which they closed in late December of 2018.
 “I happened to see it in the Times that there wasn’t going to be a program and we were finishing up the restaurant,” Mrs. Tinsley said. “It was December, too late to start it then, so I signed up for the next year.”
 In 2019, the Jefferson County Toys for Tots program supported 1,697 children through the donations of 4,582 toys. The Jefferson County program typically tries to give three toys per child, not including a stocking stuffer and a book.
 “Last year, it was kind of a one-person show,” Mrs. Tinsley said. “This year, I have a good friend who is helping me a lot.”
 Mrs. Tinsley has known Laura E. Reff of Clayton since childhood. They attended Clayton (now Guardino) Elementary School and graduated together from Thousand Islands High School. Mrs. Tinsley grew up in Fishers Landing and Mrs. Reff in Clayton.
 A tragedy, and a promise to her daughter, brought Mrs. Reff into the program.
 Lucy C. Reff, daughter of Laura and Mark A. Reff., died at the age of 23 on Jan. 12, 2019. She died from an undetected colloid cyst, which form within the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain. Lucy, a medical student at Upstate Medical University in the Respiratory Therapy Department who was due to graduate in May of 2019, had no warning of her condition. In December, a month before she died, she had a request for her parents when she was asked by them what she would like for Christmas.
 “She said, ‘I don’t need anything. Take my money and buy toys for kids who need it,’” Mrs. Reff said.
 Mrs. Reff said her husband had developed a tradition of helping needy children at Christmas time in the Clayton-area community.
 “That resonated with us as another way to continue her memory as a way of helping people,” Mrs. Reff said. “Michelle asked me last year to get involved as another thing in memory of Lucy.”
 Mrs. Reff said her involvement was limited in her first year with Toys for Tots.
 “That first year, I knew emotionally I wasn’t able to commit to something where I had to be depended upon,” said Mrs. Reff, who works as a hairdresser. “I was kind of holding back. This year, I’m able to do some more stuff than I was and now that Michelle knows more, too, we can both schedule times for me to be able to do more. She didn’t know what to tell me last year to plan on. She’s been able to tell me stuff ahead of time more.’
 That teamwork has created a certain goal for Jefferson County Toys for Tots.
 “This year, we wanted to expand the number of families who get the toys,” Mrs. Reff said. “Michelle felt she didn’t have good information on that last year.”
 Donations from community members form the backbone of Toys for Tots. People can drop off new, unwrapped toys in collection boxes located in local businesses. In Jefferson County, as of late last week, there were 46 toy drop- off sites for the program. Toys for Tots also accepts cash donations.
 Coordinators pick up the toys from the drop-off sites and store them in central warehouses where the items are sorted by age and gender. In Watertown, that work is done in the donated space of the Bruce M. Wright Memorial Conference Center on Faichney Drive.
 “I know a lot of places have to pay rent,” Mrs. Tinsley said. “And they let me store whatever extra I have there for the year. They give me a nice room and all the tables I can use.”
 The toys at the center are divided up by gender and age, largely with help from the local Kiwanis Club. The toys are organized, bagged and then picked up by the various groups who were contacted by people requesting toys.
 “They send me a list of each age and gender and I bag up toys for the numbers they give me and someone from their group comes and picks them all up,” Mrs. Tinsley said.
 One of the agencies that the Jefferson County unit works with is the Watertown Urban Mission.
 “They’ve already seen an increase in need,” Mrs. Tinsley said. “I’ve had more people contact me this year already, so I assume the need is going to be greater.”
 But Dunkin’ Donuts may be acting like Santa for the local program this year. The company is donating $10,000 to the Jefferson Country Toys for Tots for the purchase of toys.
 “It literally came out of thin air,” Mrs. Tinsley said. “With the pandemic, I was worried there will be increased need and possibly lower levels of donations. This donation will help the program immensely.”
 Mrs. Tinsley said Toys for Tots has a list of selected vendors that offer good prices to the organization.
 Such community support extends to transporting the toys. The Watertown Urban Mission and Hole Brothers Holdings offered the use of box trucks to transport toys. Other support this year has ranged from an annual $5,000 donation from the Kiwanis Club to labels from Staples for the organizing of donations to the gift, from Lowe’s, of 400 garbage bags used to transport toys.
 “Any place that I’ve walked into, as soon as they hear Toys for Tots, they say, ‘How can I help?’” Mrs. Tinsley said. “It’s been very nice.”
 Mrs. Reff also called the elementary schools in Clayton, Cape Vincent, Alexandria Bay and LaFargeville.
 “Michelle had no contacts for the river communities of families that need toys,” Mrs. Reff said. “The elementary schools have a set list of families they know of will need help. They were ecstatic this year that because of COVID and limited resources, to be able to get help getting toys, so they didn’t have to just rely on their staff and the normal ways that they do it.”
 Some staff of LaFargeville Elementary also plan to help organize the toy sorting and distribution.
 The local donations are especially gratifying for Mrs. Reff.
 “People are being so generous in Lucy’s memory,” she said. “Lucy worked so hard to get where she was in her degree because school was very hard for her. I just didn’t want her forgotten. This is great for the family to see — that people are still remembering her and honoring her. Lucy is helping other kids have a nice Christmas who might not get the material things.’’
 The end of this year’s local Toys for Tots campaign is Friday, Dec. 11. Through it all, Mrs. Reff said she has come to appreciate Mrs. Tinsley’s personal touch that she tries to bring to many families. For example, the way parents are able to wrap the presents for their tots, and teens, themselves and trying to fill a specific toy wish.
 “It’s a way for the parents to give to their kids like they’re the Santa, like we all do when we have little kids,” Mrs. Reff said. “That’s the fun of it. Playing Santa.”

Mann — a former assistant coach at Temple High School who came to UMHB as the men’s golf head coach in 1999 — will fulfill some of the same responsibilities he had as associate athletic director for four years from 2008-12, and he looks forward to the flexibility the job can provide.
 “Retirement is something I’ve contemplated for the last couple years. I almost retired a year ago but it didn’t seem right because I feel like I’m too young to retire and just sit at home,” he said. “When the other position opened up — which I really enjoyed before, getting to know visiting coaches and officials — I thought it was the perfect opportunity.
 “I’m taking it year-by-year. It depends on how much I get to travel and see my family. If it gives me the flexibility I want, then I’ll stay.”
 After leading the men’s golf team to three American Southwest Conference titles and its first appearance in the NCAA Division III national championship tournament, Mann was promoted to associate athletic director in 2008 and athletic director in 2012.
 During his tenure as athletic director, UMHB won national championships in football and women’s golf, served as host for five NCAA championship events, added the varsity sports of cross country, acrobatics and tumbling, and beach volleyball along with a strength and conditioning program, and expanded its facilities, including the opening of Crusader Stadium.
 “Randy’s investment in student-athletes has been significant,” said Dr. Steve Theodore, the school’s senior vice president for administration. “UMHB’s name is known around the country in large part because of our athletic success.”
 As for which accomplishment Mann is most proud, he can’t pick just one.
 “There’s a lot that I’m very, very proud of. I don’t know if there’s one that I’m most proud of,” he said. “The most special is the relationship I developed with my coaching staff. That’s what I’ll hold close to my heart.
 “I have a great staff assembled across the whole athletic department, and we’ve done great things. It’s always tough to step down, but spending time with my family and getting to do things that I haven’t been able to do cemented this decision in my mind.”
 As for Kerr, he said there wasn’t any convincing needed to get him to accept the role of athletic director.
 A four-year letter winner for the UMHB baseball team and the Crusaders’ head coach from 1981-83 and 1997-2001, Kerr helped start the university’s sport management program and has been the faculty athletic representative the last few years.
 Following 19 years in the classroom as a teacher, he’s getting back to his roots.
 “I was out running this morning and had flashbacks of being a student here and a coach here,” said Kerr, who won 130 games and a conference title over his two stints as the Crusaders’ coach. “I feel like I’ve come full-circle.
 “Early on in my career, this wasn’t on my radar. But since I got back to being a faculty athletic rep, I realized how much athletics is a part of me.”
 Theodore believes the combination of Kerr’s knowledge of both athletics and academics will be a boon for the school.
 “I am excited about Mickey taking over the helm of our athletic department,” Theodore said. “He brings years of athletic experience, stellar academic qualifications and a passion for UMHB to the position.”
 Kerr will continue to teach his normal class load through the spring semester before taking over his new duties in June, by which time he will have mulled over thousands of issues that all college athletic departments face.
 “I will be teaching in the spring, but I still want to help on the athletic side,” he said. “I just want to do anything I can to be helpful, and I know I’ll meet with coaches individually as we get closer to the summer.
 “I haven’t had a full night’s sleep since Dr. Theodore talked to me about the position, and I don’t mean that in a bad way. I think about so many ideas. I’m busting at the seams.”

In the Jackson 5 and on his early solo albums, Michael Jackson was a prodigy with an infectious ebullience in his voice. But as he took charge of his music’s creative direction on 1979’s _Off the Wall_ , he became a true original — developing a polyrhythmic symphony of vocal ad-libs, gasps, falsetto whoops and proto-beatboxing oral percussion that made him something more than a soul singer or a pop balladeer. He was as gifted a dancer as he was a vocalist, but both skillsets seemed intertwined, tapping his entire body into every rhythmic accent that a song had to offer.

Thanksgiving may look a little different because of the pandemic — but local organizations are still planning on filling Denton residents’ tummies with turkey and pie one way or another.
 Thanksgiving celebrations are ripe with food and good company, but it’s harder to gather with those outside your bubble for the holidays. Public health officials are warning against large gatherings, and although some may not take those precautions, The Village Church Denton is switching gears for its annual community banquet.
 The 34th annual Thanksgiving Community Banquet won’t be an in-person gathering at Calhoun Middle School this year. Before the pandemic, Stephanie Mabe with the church said staff and volunteers would start gearing up the Friday before Thanksgiving to prepare at least 2,000 meals. This year, they’re reducing that to 500 meals, to-go style.
 “COVID was a real bummer this year, and our ability to host that event safely within city regulations is just limited and not possible in the way we typically do it,” Mabe said.
 Mabe said they prepare 2,000 to 2,500 meals each year for the banquet. The event, free and open to the public, provides homemade meals to anyone needing food or wanting company on Turkey Day. Plates would be piled with turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes and slices of pumpkin pie.
 The banquet will now be a food pickup hosted at Calhoun, 709 W. Congress St.
 “We are setting up shop in Calhoun’s parking lot,” Mabe said. “On the day of, at 11 a.m., we’ll be handing out meals. They’ll still be home-cooked meals. They’ll be to-go only.”
 The church came to this decision slowly with plans finalized just last week. By early November, they realized they’d have to come up with a new plan because they didn’t have a kitchen, several hundred volunteers or a way to socially distance the amount of people they normally serve. Mabe said it was evident by early November that they would either have to reenvision the banquet or not do it at all.
 A member of The Village Church offered up his mobile catering company to mass cook the meals and help serve them on Thanksgiving. Mabe said they’ll start cooking on Wednesday this week to have 500 Thanksgiving meals ready for Nov. 26.
 “The need [for food] is greater than usual [this year], but the complexity of creating that environment safely is almost insurmountable,” Mabe said.
 The Salvation Army of Denton also hosts an annual dinner at its facility. A regional spokesperson for the Salvation Army said Monday they are finalizing Thanksgiving plans on how to serve meals in Denton, but the Carr P. Collins location west of downtown Dallas will still host an in-person early dinner.
 Cross Timbers Church and Our Daily Bread’s plans to provide to-go meals are still in place. Cross Timbers’ “Hope for the Holidays” initiative starts with Thanksgiving, where someone can adopt a Box of Hope. This means buying supplies to complete a Thanksgiving meal for a family in need.
 “We had 140 boxes adopted, and the families who will receive the boxes have already signed up,” said Melissa Poliseno, the marketing director for Cross Timbers Church. “We’re going to be distributing those this Sunday. On the 22nd at 1 p.m., the families who are receiving them are coming to pick them up.”
 In Cross Timbers’ annual program, people sign up to adopt a box, shop for items on a list and drop them off at the church’s Hope Center in Denton. The boxes are filled with nonperishable food items fit for recipients to cook a Thanksgiving meal. There’s also a $25 gift card to Kroger so families can buy a turkey.
 The food is being stored at the church’s Denton campus at 312 W. McKinney St. Poliseno said it’s become a warehouse of food since they’ve been accepting donations this year to provide nonperishable food items to those in need during the pandemic.
 Our Daily Bread, now a part of The Junction of Denton County after merging with the Monsignor King Outreach Center, will serve guests at the three locations they’re operating from: the soup kitchen’s old headquarters at St. Andrew Presbyterian Church at 300 W. Oak St., the Monsignor King shelter at 300 S. Woodrow Lane, and a local hotel housing more Monsignor King clients.
 Donations have been a little tough to come by this year, but Assistant Director Alva Santos said they have enough turkey for Thanksgiving. They’re low on ham for Christmas festivities, though.
 Guests at Our Daily Bread on Wednesday, and guests at the hotel and the Monsignor King center on Thursday, will get a holiday dinner with turkey, stuffing and pie, Santos said. The meals will be cooked by Our Daily Bread, staff from Ay Papito food truck based in Dallas and Roy Metzler, the co- president of The Junction’s board and owner of Metzler’s BBQ in Denton. But they’re still looking for volunteers to help out on those days.
 “On Thursday night, we’ll be doing a dinner at [Monsignor King] for our guests that are staying overnight there,” Santos said. “We’re going to be open all day there to offer more of a family atmosphere.”

“Everybody wants to win every game,” Broncos coach Zach Johnston said. “But winning right now is not the important thing. We are trying to build something special and I feel as we get to near Christmas and district, we’ll have that as long as they are competing and improving, because we have the athletes.”
 Goolsby, who finished the night with 21 points, blistered the Broncos in the opening quarter with 14 points, including four 3s, to give the Leopards a 16-7 advantage heading into the second.
 “Obviously, this is still early on,” said Johnston, a longtime assistant at Mary Hardin-Baylor before taking the Broncos’ reins this year. “Not having games to watch ahead of time (is tough). They’ve played one game, and we’ve played one game. So the scouting reports are…eh.”
 Not knowing much about the Leopards (2-0), the Broncos (1-1) adjusted on the fly. Goolsby hit a 3 to open the second period and didn’t score again until 3 minutes were left in the third, going 1-for-6 from long range over the final 24 minutes.
 “Right now, I’m focused on controlling our game better,” Johnston said. “Early in the season, we’ll try to make changes. When a guy can shoot, we’ll go out and contest the shot better, and they did a good job of that.”
 The Broncos trailed 30-22 at halftime but came out hot in the second half, with baskets by Peanut Brazzle and Selman Bridges cutting Lake Belton’s deficit to 31-26.
 Bridges made it 31-27 with a free throw and — after a 3-point miss by Goolsby — Leonard King made it 31-30 with a 3-pointer for the Broncos, before the Leopards responded with an 8-0 run.
 Trailing 42-32 at end of the third, Lake Belton fell further behind with a bevy of fouls, sending Lorena to the free throw line 11 times in the final frame as the Leopards expanded their lead.
 “The X’s and O’s is something we will get to,” Johnston said. “I’m more concerned about us playing defense our way. And once we get good at it, with the athletes we have, I think they will have fun with it.”
 It was only the second varsity game for the Broncos, who were led by Javeon Wilcox with 13 points and Bridges with 12. It also was a new experience for Johnston, who is still getting used to the high school game again.
 “The biggest difference for me isn’t the kids,” he said. “Whether it’s here or at UMHB, they will do what you ask them to do for the most part. The kids here are trying like crazy. The biggest difference is the shortness of the game. It seems it’s over in the blink of an eye. I know it shouldn’t make that much difference 32 minutes to 40 minutes, but it’s quick and there’s no shot clock. I keep watching myself in the middle of a possession going. ‘The shot clock has to be going off at some point. We have to get a shot off.’
 “Basketball is basketball, and I’m trying to do some of the things we did at UMHB. I’m proud of these guys. (Lorena) is a well-seasoned basketball team and we’ve just had five practices, but our guys kept challenging and working and we never felt like we were out of this contest.”

The Oxford motion has suggested that the Union should ask the university authorities for fortnightly meetings to advocate the adoption of policies that will reduce and later remove meat from the canteens. It further added that this should be “especially in respect of beef and lamb (and to campaign for) the university to issue advice to faculties, departments, and colleges on how they may follow suit in removing beef and lamb from the menu in the campus”.
