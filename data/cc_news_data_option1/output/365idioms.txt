Students have reached out to Tanzania's embassy about leaving Wuhan and were told authorities were working on it, Kizwi said. “But I don't expect it.”
 There is little to do. Police are constantly monitoring people who are out and about, his countryman Bakari said. Most supermarkets and pharmacies are closed. The one shop at his and Kizwi's school, Tongji Medical College, quickly sells out every day.
 Bakari said the Tanzanian committee has begun collecting phone numbers of international representatives for all universities in Wuhan so students can report on any shortages or which campuses are being especially helpful.
 Some students are given thermometers and visited every day for a temperature check, Bakari said. At his school, they are given face masks daily.
 "Our university gave us supplies the day before yesterday," he said, including two boxes of chocolate, cookies, sugar, cooking oil and bottles of water. "Today there's new information that if we want to go around the city, we have to ask the local community. They have provided us with a phone number and we call them to ask for transport or supplies, if possible."
 He complimented Chinese authorities on their response: "We really appreciate what they're doing."
 But Bakari said he has no plans to go out again.
 With his new stash from his supermarket visit of fruit, vegetables, legumes and milk powder — to help combat protein deficiency now that eating eggs, fish or meat is not an option since the virus jumped from animals to humans — he has settled into his role as an investigator, semi-therapist and amateur media outlet.
 This new reality can be tiring. But "actually we don't sleep these days," he said.

 The NBA has postponed the Los Angeles Lakers' next game against the Clippers set for Tuesday night in the wake of the deaths of retired superstar Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others in a helicopter crash earlier this week. The league announced the decision in a statement Monday, saying it 'was made out of respect for the Lakers organization.' The Lakers learned about the crash while flying home from an East Coast road trip Sunday. LeBron James and several other players appeared to be visibly affected by the news when getting off the plane. James made his first public comments Monday night in an Instagram post including several photos of himself with Bryant. The four-time NBA MVP and 16-time All-Star said he was 'heartbroken and devastated' and had been crying repeatedly while trying to write about Bryant. James, who joined the Lakers last season, said the two spoke by phone Sunday morning after James passed Bryant for third place on the NBA's career scoring list Saturday night. 'Didn't think for one bit in a million years that would be the last conversation we'd have,' James wrote. 'I promise you I'll continue your legacy man! You mean so much to us all here especially #LakerNation and it's my responsibility to put this (team) on my back and keep it going!! Please give me the strength from the heavens above and watch over me!' The Lakers made grief counselors available to employees Monday after the loss of Bryant, who spent his entire 20-year NBA career with the 16-time NBA champion franchise. Lakers owner Jeanie Buss was relatively close to Bryant, while Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka had been Bryant's agent during his playing career. 'The Los Angeles Lakers would like to thank all of you for the tremendous outpouring of support and condolences,' the Lakers organization said in a statement after the postponement was announced. 'This is a very difficult time for all of us.' Dwight Howard is the only current Lakers player who played with Bryant for the franchise for one season back in 2012-13, but all the players knew him. James and Bryant teamed up on the U.S. Olympic teams in 2008 and 2012, while Anthony Davis played a backup role on the 2012 London Olympics team. Bryant attended a handful of Lakers games in recent years with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, who also died in the crash in Calabasas, California. The NBA says the game between the Los Angeles rivals will be rescheduled later. The next game on the Lakers' schedule is Friday night at home against Portland. The Lakers lead the Western Conference standings and have the NBA's second-best record at 36-10. After trading for Davis and teaming him with James in the offseason, the Lakers are all but certain to end their franchise-record playoff drought at six seasons. Bryant won five championships and reached seven NBA Finals over the course of his two decades with the Lakers. He retired as the franchise's career leader in points, games played and numerous other statistical categories.

The good news is, it worked. In fact, it worked admirably. Graduation rates increased significantly and across the board for demographic subgroups. Credit attainment increased. Students' self-reported stress levels decreased. Even better, some of the site-specific adaptations that had to be made didn't seem to do any damage. For example, the CUNY model includes free MetroCards, which enable students to ride the subways for free; the idea is to remove transportation as a barrier. At the Ohio sites, as well as at most sites around the country, that's not an option. But when the Ohio sites went with gift cards that could be used for gas and food, they got similarly good results.

Bitcoin (BTC) surged more than 5% earlier this month after Iran's airstrikes at the United States military airbases in Iraq, quite in tandem with established safe havens like gold and Japanese yen. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have proved to be too unpredictable and not adhere to specific trends over time. Kostya Etus, a portfolio manager at CLS Investments, told CoinDesk that BTC can't yet be labeled as either a risk-on asset or a safe haven. "Bitcoin isn't really viewed as a safe-haven asset like gold or cash, and it doesn't have much in common with risk-on assets like stocks either," Etus said. "While most assets are specific to risk-on and risk-off environments, in which you could predict price reactions to certain events, bitcoin is not one of those assets." Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore on Tuesday announced that its Payment Services Act has come into force. The law gives the provisions for cryptocurrency businesses to register and get licensed to operate legally in the country.
