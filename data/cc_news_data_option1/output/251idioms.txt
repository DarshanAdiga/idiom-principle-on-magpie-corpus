Biden, like most Democrats, proposes raising the cap on the level of income that is subject to the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. That cap is set at $137,700 for the current tax year, meaning any income beyond that threshold is still subject to personal income tax, but not payroll taxes. Biden, and many other Democrats, propose lifting that cap to increase the tax revenue flowing into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds.

Roh, who came on board with Samsung in 1997, helped develop the Galaxy device lineup and is supposedly a stickler for engineering and design. He'll reportedly try to bolster Samsung's reputation for quality after it stumbled over the past few years. Under Koh, Samsung was forced to kill the flammable Galaxy Note 7 and had to delay the Galaxy Fold due to issues with the display.
 Roh's primary goals will be to shepherd foldable products into the mainstream and help Samsung expand in China and India. Roh is also known as a cost-cutter who outsourced smartphone production to better compete with aggressive Chinese rivals like Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo. He'll be getting to work right away, as Samsung should be unveiling its new Galaxy S20 flagship series and possibly a second-generation foldable device at a February 11th event in San Francisco.

The week opens with Martin Luther King Jr. Day -- and a spotlight on the Democratic Party's critical relationship with African American voters. The party's best-known black candidates, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, have already been knocked out the race. On paper, Joe Biden has maintained a dominant advantage over the rest of the field among black voters, but the ultimate Democratic nominee will not only need to win black voters in the primary, he or she will need to convince them to turn out in greater numbers in 2020 than they did in 2016. We'll be talking to plenty of African American leaders and watching how the candidates are received at multiple forums dedicated to King and racial justice across various states, including Iowa and South Carolina.

Those who favor Twitter over rival social networks probably already have Tweetbot or Twitterrific installed on your iOS devices. Power users prefer such third-party alternatives to the official app, but everyone deserves an environment where branded content isn’t given preferential treatment over tweets from people you actually follow.
 Billed as a “personal companion” to the corporate app, Nighthawk offers a stripped-down version of Twitter without the clutter. Sign in and get nothing but the good stuff: tweets displayed in chronological order, dark mode, rich link previews, and most importantly, no ads or other intrusions.
 This experience can be further enhanced with Smart Filters, which allow users to hide selected topics like US politics, _Star Wars_ spoilers, support responses, and retweeted content. It’s a novel idea that works surprisingly well, but there are only six filters available, with no option to customize or create others from scratch.

AUD/USD meets with some fresh supply near 200-day SMA amid stronger USD. Cautious mood further benefitted the greenback's perceived safe- haven status. The AUD/USD pair failed to capitalize on its early uptick and dropped to over one-week lows, around the 0.6860 region during the mid- European session on Monday. The pair met with some fresh supply near the very important 200-day SMA and drifted into the negative territory for the third consecutive session amid some follow-through US dollar buying interest. Aussie weighed down by stronger USD The greenback remained well supported by the recent upbeat US economic data, which raised expectations that the economy will continue to expand and reduced odds of any further rate cuts by the Fed. This coupled with a slight deterioration in the global risk sentiment further benefitted the USD's safe-haven status against the perceived riskier currencies - like the aussie - and collaborated to the downfall. The downside, however, is likely to remain cushioned amid relatively lighter trading volumes on the back of a holiday in the US and absent relevant market-moving economic releases, warranting some caution.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday removed the powerful Prosecutor-General Yury Chaika and nominated a replacement, the Kremlin said.Chaika, 68, who has served as the countrys top prosecutor since 2006, has been relieved of his position due to a transfer to another position, the Kremlin said in a statement, without providing further details.His successor is expected to be Igor Krasnov, 43, currently deputy head of the Investigative Committee, a separate state agency that probes major crimes.The Investigative Committee has repeatedly clashed with the Prosecutor-Generals Office. Putin on Monday submitted Krasnovs candidacy for consideration by the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, the Kremlin said.His candidacy is expected to be approved by lawmakers.Chaika served as justice minister between 1999 and 2006.In 2015, the anti-corruption foundation of leading Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny accused Chaikas two sons of illegally amassing large fortunes with the help of officials under their fathers command.Chaika dismissed the accusations.Last week Putin proposed re-drafting the 1993 constitution, unleashing political upheaval in Russia and triggering the resignation of the government of his loyal lieutenant Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev has been replaced by former tax chief Mikhail Mishustin who is expected to propose a new government make-up this week.

Derek Slaughter is a simple man — a local school teacher and basketball coach in his hometown of Williamsport.
 This simplicity and love for his city led him to pursue local government and get more involved in his community.
 Now, as he sits in his office as the newly elected mayor of the city he’s always known, Slaughter reflected on both his journey to the position as well as the impact that his second home, Happy Valley, had on him.
 Slaughter graduated from Penn State’s University Park campus in December 2003 with a bachelor’s degree in information sciences and technology and a minor in Spanish.
 He was elected mayor of Williamsport in November 2019, after serving two years on the city council.
 His mayoral tenure officially started on Jan. 6. He is the city’s first new mayor in over 12 years.
 “It is a heavy burden that the weight of the city and the direction of the city is on your shoulders, but at the same time, that’s exactly why it’s exciting,” Slaughter said. “Now, you’re in a position to work with city council, to work with other elected officials to move our city in a positive direction.
 “Although that is a burden and a challenge [to be mayor], it’s also very exciting to be in this position and be a part of that process. It’s everything all at once — it’s humbling, it’s exciting, it’s a lot of responsibilities, but it’s very motivating to know that you can work and engage with people to move your city forward,” he added.
 Slaughter grew up in the birthplace of Little League Baseball, graduating from Williamsport High School in 1999.
 After graduation, he followed in his family’s footsteps to attend Penn State for his undergraduate studies, initially majoring in computer science and engineering.
 He switched his major right away to IST during his first semester in fall 1999 — the first year that the then-School of IST was established at Penn State.
 Slaughter was involved with Lion Scouts during his time at Penn State. However, he wasn’t involved in anything else.
 “Sad to say, I should have been way more involved,” Slaughter said.
 After graduation, Slaughter attended graduate school at the University of Maryland College Park and received his master’s degree in education.
 Slaughter’s friends who worked in education recommended he also get his teaching certificate so he could then decide whether or not he wanted to work in IT, teach or do both.
 “Ultimately, I stayed in the D.C. area for two years and I came back home to Williamsport after that,” Slaughter said. “I decided to go the educational route.”
 He taught math at the middle school and high school levels in the Williamsport Area School District for over a decade, and also served as the head coach of the girl’s high school basketball team.
 In addition, he’s an adjunct professor at the Pennsylvania College of Technology, a Penn State affiliate school.
 In his position at the high school, community members and parents recommended he pursue local government — something he had never before considered.
 “The kids that I taught and their families, they kind of got me more involved in the political aspects of the community,” Slaughter said. “Politics was never a consideration of mine until I kind of got nudged by members of the community. They thought that I could be more proactive with issues in the community.”
 Slaughter said he was convinced to run for city council and was elected in 2017. He served for two years, at which point he decided to run for mayor — another thing he would have never considered to do.
 “People say, ‘Why didn’t I stay on city council and why did I decide to run for mayor? The mayor is where you can have the most impact in the community,’” Slaughter said. “I’m glad I ran for mayor and I’m glad to be in a position with the most impact.”
 The challenge of running for mayor is that the spotlight is “squarely on you,” Slaughter said. He said the public perception of the mayor is wildly different when it comes to him and his family.
 He said his family in particular drives him to be successful; his wife, Vanessa, and two children, son Jayden, 8, and daughter Chloe, 6. However, Slaughter said, being in the spotlight isn’t always easy.
 “Everywhere you go, especially in the digital age we live in right now, everybody has a camera,” Slaughter said. “You’re on an island, so to speak. You have to be on your toes all the time. It puts [my family] in the spotlight, too.”
 Slaughter said he mostly enjoyed the campaign trail because of all the interesting people and members of the community he got to meet. Many community members volunteered to help out with his campaign.
 He said that because his job is politics, it’s always going to be challenging, but said that he has definitely enjoyed the ride so far, calling it “very humbling.”
 Coming full circle, Slaughter is grateful for the skills and relationships that Penn State gave to him during his time as an undergraduate student.
 “They played a large part in my success, both personally and professionally, as it relates to education,” Slaughter said. “You don’t realize at the time when you’re in college how your classes and the relationships and friendships you build prepare you for what you’re going to do down the road. Penn State absolutely did that.”
 Slaughter said coming out of Penn State graduation he felt prepared to take on almost any challenge in life and any path he wanted to do — whether he wanted to go right into the workforce or go back to school like he ultimately decided to do.
 Although Penn State was “large” in his eyes, the university still allowed him to have close relationships with colleagues and professors to better his education and skillset, which has now helped him in the mayoral position.
 “I owe Penn State a huge debt of gratitude for the success I’ve had,” he said.

In the mid and smallcap segments, on a stock specific basis, there is considerable opportunity for wealth creation over the next 18 to 24 months, says Shibani Sircar Kurian, Senior Vice President, Fund Manager & Head-Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. All the IT majors have reported numbers for Q3. Where would you say there is reason for concern and where were you positively surprised?The result season has kicked off with most of the IT names reporting their numbers. The key to watch out for the IT names was the commentary from the management in terms of growth outlook going into next year. However, the growth outlook continues to remain fairly muted. There is still not much visibility of revival of demand, especially in the BFSI end and especially so among the larger banks. That area remains a point of concern for the sector as a whole. Q3 was expected to be a muted quarter given that it is a seasonally weak quarter from a growth perspective and by and large, numbers have been in line with expectations. The other point to note is that there has been not too much visibility of any improvement in margins going forward. One of course growth is muted and therefore from a margin perspective that impact still remains. Secondly the cost of doing business clearly is going up given the fact that given the higher cost of subcontracting larger deals means margins are under pressure and therefore margin outlook was also not seemingly great going into next year. From an overall sector perspective, there are still a lot of question marks both on growth and margins. Valuations are not stretched and therefore this sector has been more of a defensive where you are still seeing cash flow generation as a result of which, from a capital allocation perspective to shareholders, cash is being returned. It is more defensive rather than growth. Going into next quarter, we will see the budgeting play out and momentum in terms of how the deal flows pan out. We will get further visibility next year. As of now, it seems to be fairly muted, especially with large verticals such as BFSI and retail in terms of the growth outlook for the sector as a whole. Talking about the banking space, what do you make of the numbers that have come so far? Is there clear evidence of loan growth being slower than anticipated?Yes. System loan growth has slowed down. What was tracking at about 9%-10% has now slowed down to about 7% odd. After a period of time, we have actually seen deposit growth at a system level being higher than loan growth which is why banks are starting to cut their deposit rate. After a very prolonged period of time, deposit rate cuts are happening. It means the market share shift that was happening is continuing and it is fairly accelerated. So market share shifts away from PSU banks as well as NBFCs in the system towards private banks. Private banks continue to gain a larger pie of the incremental loan book and that is continuing. Second, with deposit rates now starting to come off at the margin there will be flow through in terms of rates coming off on the lending side as well because MCLR is linked to the deposit cost and as deposit costs moderate, the lending rates will also start to moderate. While the large legacy NPLs are now possibly behind us and a lot of that recognition has happened, there is still some stress in the mid corporate pack which is now visible in terms of some of the numbers that you have seen. Agri stress is also something that we need to watch out for. Retail credit quality on the other hand, seems to be holding up fairly well even on the unsecured piece. Both credit cards as well as personal loan portfolios have seen credit cost being fairly stable and while this portfolio is growing, one needs to monitor if the retail asset quality is holding up well. It has been a mixed set of numbers. Loan growth has clearly slowed down for the system as a whole but at the margin, the market share shift towards private sector banks seems to have accelerated. The Reliance stock has been steady. There is GRM pressure but on the retail and telecom side, it seems to be going great guns. Are you that the Aramco deal would not get closed within this fiscal?Unfortunately, I cannot possibly comment on specific stocks, and would not be able to comment on the results of Reliance. However, from an oil and gas space, this quarter is likely to see muted numbers on the refining margins front especially for the OMCs. Some part of the weakness on the refining margins would be offset by higher marketing margins but clearly this is going to be a quarter where overall trends for OMCs would be weak on the refining front and we would need to watch out for that. What about the telecom sector? Would you say there is merit in looking at the sector? Bharti Infratel has taken quite a knock and some of the banks may see quite a bit of pressure on the back of telecom exposure?Yes. the last three years were extremely negative for the telecom sector given that there was a significant amount of pricing pressure and competition to gain market share. Clearly that has changed and at the margin, the focus of all the players are now to improve profitability and balance sheet and therefore the trends in terms of improvement on pricing would continue and that would aid profitability for the sector as a whole. The question remains whether it remains a three-player market or turns into a two- player market. Given the fact that we expect tariff hikes to continue, balance sheet deleveraging would be visible in some of the larger players. The sector seems to be well placed in terms of improvement on profitability. How the regulatory perspective plays out, we will have to wait and watch. Do you think that a lot of the recent run up in the market especially the broader markets, has got to do with global flows that are just coming in?Yes, a part of the market movement is clearly attributable to flows and as you mentioned, global flows have been extremely good and that is adding to the market movement. However, from a broader market perspective, over the last two, two and a half years, the underperformance has been stark and in terms of valuations of the midcap index vis-à-vis the largecap index, we are now down to five-year lows. From a risk-reward perspective, we believe that there is a considerable amount of opportunity in the midcap space. It is extremely difficult to time the market. However, the mid and the small cap segments and on a stock specific basis, there is considerable opportunity in terms of wealth creation over the next 18 to 24 month period. One key factor that we need to watch out for is how the growth pans out especially in terms of macro growth as well as earnings growth. One thing to note is that a) the flow-through in terms of lower policy rates and lower lending rates is now beginning and therefore the transmission of rates in the system has improved significantly over the last three-four month period. b)From an earnings perspective as well, earnings improvement is now starting to play through. This year for instance, we are looking at 10-12% earnings growth on the back of corporate tax cuts and next year possibly between 15-18% earnings growth and therefore at the broader market level, there are definite opportunities from a stock specific basis to add to the portfolio.

Andy Robertson says Liverpool will not think about winning the Premier League title until it is mathematically certain, saying the players remain determined to stick to their game-by-game mentality.
 A 2-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday extended their lead over second-placed Manchester City at the top of the table to 16 points with a match in hand. They require just 10 more victories, having already registered 21 in 22 fixtures, to guarantee a first championship in 30 years and they look uncatchable.
 Fans at Anfield on Sunday sang “We’re going to win the league” but Robertson said the players were not complacent. “We would obviously love to say yes – but no,” said the Scotland defender.
 “You are playing against your rivals who you’ve had great battles with over the years and the fans probably want to rub it in a bit but we’re not getting carried away. Until the champions sign is above our heads we don’t believe anything. Yes, the lead is 16 points but we know how tough it gets.”
 Liverpool travel to face Wolves on Wednesday in the Premier League, with games coming up against West Ham and Southampton.
 “We will let other people say that (they will not drop enough points to lose the title) but I don’t think anyone in that dressing room is believing that just yet and I think you can see that with every performance we are putting in,” said Robertson. “We can believe once the final whistle of that game goes.”
 Jurgen Klopp’s side have not lost a league match since January 3 last year, a run of 39 matches, and there is growing talk about a potential ‘Invincibles’ campaign.
 “Looking too far and thinking can we go unbeaten is pointless,” said Robertson. “The last 39 games have been incredible but for us it is unfortunate it has not been in one season, it has been across two.
 “We keep going, we are on a good run just now, we are confident. Seven clean sheets on the bounce is massive and long may that continue.”

The National Initiatives for Sustainable and Climate-smart Oil Palm Smallholders (NISCOPS) has been launched by Solidaridad in Accra, Ghana.
 NISCOPS is a five year strategic programme aimed to among others enable governments in key oil palm producing countries to support and work with farmers towards more sustainable, climate smart palm oil production as well as contribute to Paris Agreement, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) objectives and the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs).
 The programme is being implemented in Africa (Ghana and Nigeria) and Asia (Indonesia and Malaysia) with the initial funding support from the Government of the Netherlands.
 The programme has an inception year (2019) with the implementation phase I from 2020 to 2023 and implementation phase II from 2024 and beyond.
 The Regional Director, Solidaridad West Africa, Isaac Gyamfi during the launch of the programme in Accra, Ghana and the inauguration of the programme National Advisory Committee (NAC), said, "We make bold here to say Solidaridad is in term with the current global and local realities especially on climate change and agriculture and we are now using our over 50 years' experience of both foot and brain on the ground through our works to contribute to shaping practices and policies at local, districts, national and global levels".
 Solidaridad has been in Ghana's Oil palm landscape since 2012 promoting yield intensification at both the farm and mill levels through introduction of Best Management Practices (BMP) and improved processing technology respectively.
 The organization has also supported the revitalization of the Oil Palm Development Association of Ghana (OPDAG).
 Solidaridad has also played a role in the establishment of the Tree Crops Development Authority. These have been implemented under our Sustainable West Africa Oil Palm Program (SWAPP).
 Analysis from SWAPP shows that an average farm yield of at least 12tons/ha/year for existing farms coupled with oil extraction rate of 18% will make Ghana self-sufficient in Crude Palm Oil (CPO) production. This can only be realised when among other interventions such as BMP, great attention is paid to the impacts of climate change on the sector as well as the contribution of the oil palm sector to climate change.
 In his presentation during the event, Dr. Samson Samuel Ogallah, Solidaridad Senior Climate Specialist for Africa and the NISCOPS Technical Coordinator stated that the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the programme is built on the three pillars of Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) of Productivity, Adaptation and Mitigation.
 Dr. Ogallah added that the programme in addition to its contribution to the NDCs and SDGs of the four countries, aimed to further build capacity of smallholders (organizations) and local institutions to improve performance as well as support development of landscape level mechanisms to operate in 'vulnerable' landscapes prone to deforestation.
 In her speech at the event, Katja Lasseur, Deputy Head of Mission, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ghana, expressed the commitment of the Government of the Netherlands to the programme and call on other partners and stakeholders to come on board in order to achieve the laudable objectives of the programme.
 The Minister for Food and Agriculture, Dr.OwusuAfriyieAkoto in his speech which was delivered on his behalf stated that Agriculture is the backbone of the Ghanaian economy. Achieving sustainable food security in a world of growing population and changing diets is a major challenge under climate change.
 Climate change will have far-reaching consequences for agriculture that will disproportionately affect poor and marginalized groups who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and have a lower capacity to adapt.
 Dr. Akoto added "I am happy to note that the overarching goal of NISCOPS is to contribute towards Ghana's Nationally Determined Contribution of the Paris Climate Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals through; Building the climate resilience of smallholder oil palm farmers and oil palm processors; Promoting use of energy efficient cook stoves at the artisanal processing level and; Implementing community led adaptation and livelihood diversification programs.
 I wish to assure you of Government support to create the enabling environment for the successful implementation of the programme in selected vulnerable communities in order to replicate it in other sectors of the economy to mitigate the impact of climate change"
 A nine-member National Advisory Committee (NAC) to advise the programme was inaugurated. The NAC members comprised of Public and Private sector representatives from the Oil Palm Development Association of Ghana, Oil Palm Research Institute, Ministries of Food and Agriculture; Trade and Industry; Local Government and Rural Development; Land and Natural Resources; Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (Environmental Protection Agency and Forestry Commission).
 NISCOPS is implemented by Solidaridad in Ghana and Solidaridad in partnership with IDH in Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria.

Samsung Electronics has named Roh Tae-moon CEO of its key smartphone division, according to Bloomberg. He'll take over the position from DJ Koh, who will continue to head up Samsung's IT and mobile and communication arms. Roh is Samsung's third CEO in the last dozen years, as Koh was appointed in 2015 while Koh's predecessor JK Shin held the job for around six years. Roh, who came on board with Samsung in 1997, helped develop the Galaxy device lineup and is supposedly a stickler for engineering and design. He'll reportedly try to bolster Samsung's reputation for quality after it stumbled over the past few years. Under Koh, Samsung was forced to kill the flammable Galaxy Note 7 and had to delay the Galaxy Fold due to issues with the display.\n\nRoh's primary goals will be to shepherd foldable products into the mainstream and help Samsung expand in China and India. Roh is also known as a cost-cutter who outsourced smartphone production to better compete with aggressive Chinese rivals like Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo. He'll be getting to work right away, as Samsung should be unveiling its new Galaxy S20 flagship series and possibly a second-generation foldable device at a February 11th event in San Francisco.

La ragazza, studendessa 19enne di origini cinesi, con cittadinanza italiana, aveva denunciato l'altro giorno un episodio di razzismo di cui sarebbe rimasta vittima su un treno regionale, a Mestre. In un post sul suo profilo Facebook ha raccontato di essere stata insultata, con frasi razziste e sessiste, e riempita di sputi da un gruppo di giovani bulli - alcuni minorenni - che l'avrebbero presa di mira solo per l'evidenza delle sue origini orientali. La giovane, che vive a Badia Polesine (Rovigo), frequenta l'universita Ca' Foscari a Venezia. Lo scorso anno, al compimento dei 18 anni, ha ricevuto dal sindaco il certificato con la cittadinanza italiana. L'episodio razzista, iniziato sulla pensilina della stazione di Mestre, sarebbe poi proseguito a bordo del treno regionale che doveva portare la 19enne a casa. La stessa vittima racconta nel post di aver reagito a tono al gruppo di balordi, che prima di scendere alla stazione di Padova le hanno anche sputato addosso. Nello scompartimento c'era solo un altro ragazzo, che pero sarebbe rimasto in disparte. Sull'episodio e intervenuta anche la direzione regionale di Trenitalia, annunciando l'avvio di accertamenti e dicendosi pronta ad incontrare la ragazza.

The other point to note is that there has been not too much visibility of any improvement in margins going forward. One of course growth is muted and therefore from a margin perspective that impact still remains. Secondly the cost of doing business clearly is going up given the fact that given the higher cost of subcontracting larger deals means margins are under pressure and therefore margin outlook was also not seemingly great going into next year.

The 49ers joined Don Shula's Miami Dolphins from 1971 and '73 as the only teams in the Super Bowl era to finish a playoff game with fewer than 10 pass attempts. Jimmy Garoppolo completed 6-of-8 passes for 77 yards (2-of-2 for 29 after halftime). "It's kind of a feast or famine defense," Garoppolo said, "so we got a couple big plays the first time we played them and thought we'd have those opportunities, but they wanted to take those away and open up the running lanes." The two best completions: a 30-yarder to Deebo Samuel over the middle to spark their first touchdown drive, and a 19-yard catch-and-run on George Kittle's lone target after the Packers pulled within 14 points.
