"People think that going to Europe is about having a lavish lifestyle, big house, good car- its not that. You start from scratch. You have to prove that you are good enough to be on the bench, then get a chance in the starting 11. You should start from smaller clubs of smaller leagues in Europe. You have to be very talented, you have to be mentally strong and be there and work. I’m afraid that many can’t do this. It entails lots of sacrifices. If they can do it, why not us? Many people don’t know the reality."

Proprio lui, però, aveva pochi giorni fa minimizzato sui migranti. «Sono preoccupato per coloro che tornano dallevacanze. I casi di contagio riguardano più queste persone che non i migranti che vengono controllati e quarantenati». Sileri aveva ribadito la necessità di prestare «massima attenzione» ai migranti, che «devono essere testati» e «controllati perché non devono fuggire. Ma - sottolinea - sono più preoccupato dei casi che arrivano in business class».

"I think it (the stint with Stabaek) made me a better player by leaps and bounds. It fortified my mentality and made me independent. The exposure makes you tougher, a person who can deal with every kind of situation. Nowadays, young players don’t get tough situations. (In Europe) you will be in an isolated place where there's no other Indian in the league. The language, the food, everything is different. It helped me gain that mental strength.
