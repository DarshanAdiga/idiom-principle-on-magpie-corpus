In a Kuzma-for-Bogdanovic deal, their salaries don’t match. Kuzma is owed $1.97 million this season, while Bogdanovic is owed $8.53 million in salary. The Lakers would have to cobble together roughly another $4.5 million in salaries to be able to do a deal, which seems hard to do without taking another key piece of the rotation. There is a $1.75 million trade exception for DeMarcus Cousins that helps. Quinn Cook is owed $3 million at the moment, which gets you there on paper, but given that he’s not playing at the moment, it’s hard to gauge how Sacramento would value him as an asset. It’s relevant that Sam Amick added to his report, “filler salary is of no interest to the Kings.”

The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee approved a bill to punt to the states the prohibition or any control of marijuana. The bill removes cannabis from the long-standing Controlled Substance Act, which "schedules" marijuana as a dangerous drug, has a high potential for abuse and has no medical benefits.
 Hooray for vertical federalism that gives states control! But wait …
 What about LSD, heroin and a sundry of other dangerous drugs that the federal government has seriously controlled since 1970 so that citizens are not walking around dazed and confused? Why has marijuana been given a "get out of jail free" card and, most important, where are the public health, behavioral health and health care professionals who claim to be advocates for evidenced- based health promoting policies?
 The proliferation of marijuana-friendly public policies and little pushback from the health care professionals is stunning, given that our country is burdened with the enduring alcohol and tobacco abuse problems, the opioid overdose carnage and the "mysterious" ills of teen vaping. A dozen states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana and more are seriously considering this.
 The movement to grow, distribute, market and sell marijuana officially has been around for decades. But the emerging marijuana industry's break happened with the confluence of changes in socio-cultural norms, legislators' attraction to the newest consumer cash cow and vicarious exemption to use cannabis for medicinal purposes.
 Adding what undoubtedly will be another public health crisis has entered society with barely a peep from the media and health officials (public, private or nonprofit). In late August, the U.S. surgeon general, to whom public health advocates normally listen, sent a health advisory warning us of the known and potential hazards of using marijuana.
 The competition to see what legislator or candidate can be the most liberal and the ring of the tax cash register has brought legislators clamoring to get on board the marijuana sales gravy train. Similarly, advocates to free marijuana are giddy about beating the ostensible Puritanesque propaganda that keeps pot out of our hands. Changing socio-cultural attitudes toward marijuana does not obviate the need to see credible scientific evidence that normalizing pot will not be a major public health threat.
 Normalizing marijuana on the back of reasonable consideration for medical marijuana, still in its pilot stage, is a clever bait and switch. It is understandably unpopular to be against something that will help ameliorate or placate conditions or diseases that plague people, such as cancer, PTSD, Alzheimer's and AIDS. Hence, medical marijuana use enterprises are now available in 33 states and several territories, and more states will be joining them. Few are speaking up that making the leap from these "compassionate care acts" to the mercenary "opportunity and reinvestment" acts is disingenuous.
 Those who think normalizing marijuana will support small businesses, reduce the census in our jails, decrease addiction and street sales, and help minority communities are, well … smoking something. The cannabis trade will be an elaborate enterprise and the drug quickly will become commodified. It is being built by high-rolling investors, influential lobbyists, real estate prospectors, specialty bankers, lawyers, and -- most concerning -- marketing experts with creative teams who will work to get into the heads of the many new consumers.
 Tax dollars collected easily will be diluted by the bureaucratic units needed to control every facet of the business. As with tobacco, alcohol and vaping products, advertising and marketing campaigns will push the limit to gain and keep loyal customers -- including our youth. Police officers need to retool how to determine who is under the influence to keep our roads safe. This adds another "profiling charge" opportunity for lawyers when police need to stop, search and seize users driving on roads.
 Workplaces will need to add a tome of policies and procedures and more drug testing to ensure that employees are not toking on the job. The increasing list of maladies approved for medical use increases the pool of acceptable use.
 To capitalize on "what is good about using cannabis" and to appease the push to be progressive, we should establish state laws that the growing, distribution, advertising and sale of medical marijuana be handled by health care nonprofits such as university research hospitals, hospital systems or substance abuse and behavior health rehabilitation nonprofits. There should be none to minimal taxes, which will keep the price down for those who use it for legitimate health care reasons. It should be illegal outside of medicinal use.
 This approach is truly compassionate and not opportunistic. Otherwise, get ready for more substance abuse, crime and compromised health rehabilitation services that will need to be built well beyond cottage industries to keep up with the health damage by normalizing marijuana in our society.

Yes, Kansas is a strongly Republican state that is surely in the bag for Donald Trump (he won the state by 20 points in 2016). But it’s also a state with a more ideologically heterodox GOP than many others, but where a dominant hard-core culturally conservative wing still has the power to win primaries. And with Pompeo out of the race, the front-runner in the 2020 Senate race instantly becomes former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who managed to lose the governorship to Democrat Laura Kelly in 2018.

Plenty of members of Congress are terrified of the consequences of voting to authorize or reject military action. You could argue the vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq was the issue that helped Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary, or at least one of the issues. In the current primary, Joe Biden is still getting grief for his vote over Iraq. Passing a new authorization of military force would require Congress to declare that one set of military strikes is authorized but another set is not — a vote that could hurt them down the road. They’ll be accused either of reckless warmongering or of denying the military the authority to strike a gathering threat.

Trump Tries to Explain Soleimani Strike to Rush Limbaugh: He Made 'Bombs that Blow Up All Over the Place'


--DocBreak--
By Richard Cowan, Susan Cornwell and David Morgan
 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he had enough support from his fellow Republicans to set the rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, dealing a blow to Democrats' efforts to call new witnesses against the president.
 Democrats want at least three White House officials and Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton to testify at the trial in the Republican-controlled Senate about the president's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival.
 McConnell has resisted the idea, instead seeking a fast trial based on evidence collected in the House of Representatives before it voted last month to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
 While Republicans are still divided over whether the Senate should eventually hear more testimony, the vast majority of them have agreed to leave the decision until after the trial has started, McConnell told a news conference.
 Senator Lindsey Graham said at least 51 of the 53 Republicans in the Senate were backing that plan.
 "We’ve got the votes necessary to start the trial using the Clinton model, which is good news," Graham said, referring to an arrangement made during the 1999 impeachment trial of then-President Bill Clinton after Republicans and Democrats were similarly deadlocked over the question of witness testimony.
 The House has charged Trump with abusing his power for personal gain by asking Ukraine to announce a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in November's presidential election.
 It also charged the president with obstructing Congress by directing administration officials and agencies not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.
 Trump says he did nothing wrong and has dismissed his impeachment as a partisan bid to undo his 2016 election win.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, has declined to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, effectively delaying any trial and giving Senate Democrats some time to win support for the introduction of new witnesses and documents that could bolster their case for removing Trump from office.
 Earlier on Tuesday, Pelosi's office said no decision has been made on the timeline for sending the articles to the Senate.
 But the Senate Republicans' decision to close ranks is likely to increase the pressure on Pelosi to do so.
 McConnell has emerged as the clear winner of the standoff with Pelosi and could be in a position to dictate the pace of the trial, thanks to the strong backing he has received from his caucus, Republican strategist Alex Conant said.
 "Pelosi started down this pathway without a clear exit ramp, and McConnell just took control of the car,” said Conant, who added that the Senate Republican leader was in a position to control the process unless Democrats co-opted four Republicans.
 Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said Democrats needed to decide on their best strategy. "At this point our best leverage is probably inside that trial," he said.
 The trial is expected to lead to Trump's acquittal before the 2020 presidential election campaign heats up, as no Republicans have voiced support for ousting him from office. A two-thirds majority of the Senate is needed to vote to do that.
 'THEY CAN'T HIDE'
 Democrats have argued that Bolton and the other new witnesses must be heard for the trial to be fair.
 They had focussed their efforts on persuading several moderate Republicans to settle the witness battle before the start of the trial, but had seen "no traction," according to one Senate Democratic aide.
 They are now focussing their attention on winning over Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski as potential allies during the trial, with the hope that capturing them could spur other Republicans to abandon Trump.
 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would force votes during the proceedings to have the witnesses testify and for new evidence to be submitted.
 "Make no mistake, on the question of witnesses and documents, Republicans may run, but they can't hide," Schumer said on the Senate floor.
 Bolton, who was fired by Trump in September, said on Monday he was willing to testify.
 Other witnesses during the House impeachment investigation testified that Bolton strongly objected to an effort by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine's government outside of regular diplomatic channels, with one saying Bolton referred to the arrangement as a "drug deal."
 Congressional investigators believe Bolton objected to Trump's decision to delay $390 million in military aid to Ukraine and could elaborate on that, a Senate aide told Reuters this week.
 Bolton refused to participate in the House impeachment inquiry while the Trump administration and Congress battled in court for access to witnesses and documentary evidence.
 The White House could try to block Bolton from testifying.
 When asked on Tuesday if he would be okay if Bolton testified, Trump told reporters at the White House: "That's going to be up to the lawyers. It'll be up to the Senate, and we'll see how they feel."

Eden Prairie’s boys hockey team snapped a two-game losing streak with an avalanche of goals Saturday, Jan. 4, in Buffalo.
 The final score was 8-0, as the Eagles rolled with a 38-12 advantage in shots on goal.
 “Buffalo was jacked to play us in their first game in the Lake Conference,” Eden Prairie head coach Lee Smith said. “But once we scored our fourth goal [early in the second period], that took the wind out of their sails.”
 Captain John Mittelstadt led Eden Prairie’s puck movement, finishing the game with four assists. Goals were spread across the board with two by Ben Steeves and one each by Mason Langenbrunner, Luke Mittelstadt, Drew Holt, Tyler Johnson and Kam Langefels.
 Jake Casey was another top playmaker with two assists, and goalie Eli Andrews stopped all 12 Bison shots on net.
 Eden Prairie battle some injuries and sickness during the holidays and lost twice in the Hockey for Life Tournament in Prior Lake.
 “If everyone is healthy at then end of the season, that’s what I’m looking for,” Smith said. “In the Buffalo game we came back to making the simple plays and not over passing the puck. Teams are playing us hard, playing us physical, so there is, no doubt, going to be some wear and tear.”
 Excited for the chance to compete for the Lake Conference title, Smith said, “Until someone takes it away from Edina, it is their [Lake] title.”
 The Hornets won state last year, when they edged Eden Prairie by a goal in the state finals.
 “Wayzata is a good hockey team that’s hard to score on,” Smith said. “And Minnetonka is playing better. Along with us and Edina, those are the big four in the conference.”
 Eden Prairie enters this week’s action with an overall record of 9-2-1. The Eagles don’t have a conference game this week, but will play two northern powers in games at Eden Prairie Community Center.
 Cloquet comes to town for a 7 p.m. game Friday, Jan. 10, and Duluth East visits Eden Prairie at 3 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 11.

Cada centavo cuenta, así que lo que puedas reunir es muy apreciado”, escribió la estrella australiana en la mencionada red social. El dinero está destinado para ayudar a las familias damnificadas y a los animales que perdieron sus hogares a causa del siniestro que está arrasando vorazmente con todo lo que encuentre a su paso. Chris Hemsworth colocó en su biografía de Instagram un enlace que dirige a 13 vínculos para que los usuarios también puedan contribuir con un poco de dinero en la lucha contra los incendios forestales en Australia. “En mi biografía, agregué enlaces para apoyar a los bomberos, organizaciones y organizaciones benéficas que están trabajando para brindar apoyo y alivio durante este momento devastador y desafiante.

Cabe recordar más de 480 millones de animales y 24 personas han muerto a causa de los incendios. También, el siniestro va arrasando con más de cuatro millones de hectáreas. El koala está funcionalmente extinto y mediante redes sociales se han compartido videos de rescates a diferentes animales como canguros. Ya son cuatro meses que los incendios no pueden ser apagados y muchos usuarios ruegan de que empiece a llover.

Dizboni notes that Soleimani was in Iraq trying to extend Iran’s influence and power in the area. He also says that while reporting to Iran’s leader, the general nonetheless seemed to be operating as a state within a state acting on his own initiative in both foreign and domestic affairs, and as Dizboni says, was to some extent was running foreign policy. The professor says because of that some in the top echelons of the regime may indeed have wanted to see the general moved out the way to reduce his increasing political influence. However, while not entirely out of the question, he feels it is unlikely that the dislike would go so far as to have anyone in the regime involved in the general’s death.

Someone up at the North Pole must have gotten the message.
   
 Santa never looked so good.
   
 When I was a kid, my mother used to take us to the neighboring town to see Santa Claus over Christmas. What I recall from those visits was that Santa's sleigh was oddly parked in some side alley and that we received as a treat a small box that contained four chocolates, like the kind you get in a Whitman's Sampler.
   
 I also recall, though vaguely, that the Santa we visited looked a bit less than the Real McCoy. Sure, he had the red suit and the whiskers and the eyeglasses, but he just didn't look authentic enough.
   
 Flash-forward nearly 30 years to when we took my daughter to the local shopping center for her first real, honest-to-goodness meeting with Saint Nick. The Santa that day? Some young kid, wearing blue-tinted eyeglasses, who could barely keep the sorry-looking white wig and whiskers on.
   
 Things have gotten better since then. A few years later, we took my daughter to see another Santa in downtown Meadville who was spot-on, although a bit skinny for the part. We later took her and her cousins to a breakfast with Santa at the Riverside Inn, and the guy playing the role was as good as it gets.
   
 I've paid closer attention to the Santa stand-ins since then, mainly because I had to do a lot of explaining to my daughter in order to convince her that the guy wearing the blue-tinted glasses really was a friend of Saint Nick and was helping him out.
   
 I often thought about what I would do if I encountered one of those really bad-looking Santas. Would I pull the guy aside and suggest that he either make a better effort or stand down? Would I tell the kids in line to go home because the "real" Santa wouldn't be visiting that day?
   
 Thankfully, I never had to do these things. All the Santas I've seen from my vantage point have done an excellent job in looking the part.
   
 Keep up the good work, and see you next December.

Will they retreat, as mainstream parties adopt their agendas, or is this just a slight pause? Again, I would say the previous trend has been exhausted and this is a new and hard-to-predict moment.
 Another recent trend, the proliferation of new #MeToo cases and an accompanying rise in publicity, may also be losing momentum.
 Figures such as Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein have receded from the news.
 Could this issue come back with another major celebrity-linked scandal? Absolutely — but it also might have cooled off for a while. The prediction that there will be more #MeToo cases is no longer so easy.
 Are there examples of contrary cases, where an important preexisting trend still seems very much in force?
 Well, carbon emissions will almost certainly get worse before they get better. When it comes to temperatures, however, the global data have exhibited periodic flat periods or even declines before renewed rises. So at least in the short run, predictability there is not so great either.
 One implication is that the coming year may hold an especially large number of surprises. Alternatively, rational people (and readers of Philip Tetlock, who has studied the difficulty of forecasting the future) might discard their hubris and not be very surprised at all.
 In any case, it is a scary moment. Past performance is not indicative of future results, as they say on Wall Street, and that may be even more true in 2020. Don’t throw out your history books, but you may want to open your mind about what happens next.

According to the letter from the foundation, “a concerned local resident contacted us to report that the Preston County Commission sponsored a National Day of Prayer event on May 2, 2019.”
 It stated that “reportedly, a local pastor delivered a prayer, and a number of uniformed Morgantown Police Department officers participated in the event.”
 The officer being referred to was Mike Charlton, pastor of New Life Ministries in Reedsville, who addressed those attending.
 The letter claims the “National Day of Prayer drives a wedge between the 35 percent of Americans who are non-Christian and the rest of the populace,” citing a PEW Research Center report dated Oct. 16.
 “I think it takes care of itself in that you now have policies and procedures in regard to the use of the courthouse lawn,” Mace said. Those policies and procedures were approved in October 2018 and took effect Jan. 1, 2019.
 The foundation requested the commission inform them of the steps they will take to “respect the right of conscience of all the citizens.”
 Price asked Mace to prepare a reply to the foundation, which commissioners will review.

Over CalGang’s more than two decades of operation, officials have defended it by praising its usefulness and integrity. They say it provides crucial information for criminal investigations — it’s largely a ready-made list of suspects, potential informants, and witnesses, after all — and can be accessed only by “specifically trained law-enforcement officers and support staff.” It cannot, they insist, be used to screen people for employment purposes or immigration status, a claim the public has few concrete means of verifying. It’s a convenient feature of CalGang that believing in its putative limitations and pure intentions (and the veracity of the ways California police designate gang membership in general) hinges almost entirely on whether you’re willing to trust that law-enforcement officials, when presented with a powerful, opaque, and largely unaccountable surveillance tool, will simply choose to do the right thing.

Guardiola showed his intent by naming a strong team but without a natural striker as Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus were left on the bench. The fluid front four of Silva, Mahrez, Raheem Sterling and Kevin de Bruyne were too fleet of foot and thought for a United defence without the injured Harry Maguire.
 An extra midfielder also helped City dominate possession and nullify United counter-attacks.
 City got their reward with a sumptuous strike from Silva to open the floodgates.
 The Portuguese international has struggled to reach the heights of a brilliant campaign as City won a domestic treble last season, but was back to his best as he smashed a shot into the top corner from outside the box.
 Silva turned creator for City's second on 33 minutes as one pass split the United defence and Mahrez raced in behind Victor Lindelof before rounding David de Gea to slot into an empty net.
 Five minutes later it was 3-0 as De Bruyne left Phil Jones flat on the ground before his powerful shot was parried by De Gea into the path of the unfortunate Pereira, who could only turn the ball into his own net.
 Only De Gea's brilliance and the profligacy of Sterling prevented the scoreline becoming even more embarrassing for Solskjaer before half-time.
 The Spanish goalkeeper spread himself to make a magnificent save from Silva before Sterling failed to turn home Kyle Walker's inviting cross as his run without a goal against United stretched to 18 games.
 City eased up after the break but should still have extended their lead when De Gea saved well with his legs from Mahrez.
 Moments later, United grabbed a lifeline when they finally caught the visitors cold on the break as Mason Greenwood teed up Rashford to calmly slot into the far corner for his 17th goal of the season.
 But there was no late rally from the Red Devils to further cut City's advantage as the blue side of Manchester celebrated a third straight win at Old Trafford and a fourth in five derbies on the road since Guardiola took charge.

The Dove Award-winning group Avalon is headlining its first tour in a decade, and anticipation for what the road might bring couldn't be higher for singer Greg Long.
 Also nominated for Grammy Awards, Avalon will bring part of their Called Tour at 7 p.m. March 6 at Evangel Temple, 1201 Towson Ave. The group is known to millions for songs "Everything to Me," "Can't Live a Day," "Mercy Said No," "Testify to Love," "Adonai," "Reason Enough," "The Glory" and "Orphans of God." The all-ages concert will serve as an opportunity for people to hear some of the best-known Avalon songs and more, Long said.
 "We have to play many of the songs we're known for, and that is completely fine," Long said during a recent telephone interview. "We'll definitely be doing songs from the new record, 'Called,' but we won't be forgetting many of the songs that people wish and expect to hear at an Avalon concert. We know that list of songs goes on and on, and that's fun for us.
 "And we haven't made new music in a very long time, so we are excited about our new album, also," he added. "For us to be blessed to release a new single, 'Keeper of My Heart,' and have people respond to it in such a wonderful, positive way, is great."
 Sarah Kelly, who also is a Grammy Award nominee, will serve as the opening act for the Fort Smith concert.
 Like virtually every Avalon concert, the upcoming show will feature an acoustic-based segment that will present some of the material in a "more intimate, stripped-down" approach, said Long, whose wife, Janna, also is a member of Avalon.
 "I like to call that part of the evening 'Hearing Our Voices in the Raw,' so to speak," he said with a laugh. "We have a lot of fun with it, and we always try to not stray too far from the original melodies of the songs."
 Another unique feature during the show was created to "excite" audiences and keep the members of Avalon on their collective, creative toes, Long said.
 "You don't really see this much in secular concerts or Christian concerts, but we actually take requests from the audience during the concert," he said. "Sometimes it can be a whole lot of fun.
 But sometimes the audience can stump the band with a request, he said.
 "There was a request one time and Janna said she didn't think we she do that one song," Long recalled. "But we always try to meet the requests."
 Tickets for the upcoming concert range from $24.50 to $75 and can be purchased by calling (877) 234-3847 and at EventBrite.com/e/TheCalled.

 Someone up at the North Pole must have gotten the message.
 Santa never looked so good.
 When I was a kid, my mother used to take us to the neighboring town to see Santa Claus over Christmas. What I recall from those visits was that Santa's sleigh was oddly parked in some side alley and that we received as a treat a small box that contained four chocolates, like the kind you get in a Whitman's Sampler.
 I also recall, though vaguely, that the Santa we visited looked a bit less than the Real McCoy. Sure, he had the red suit and the whiskers and the eyeglasses, but he just didn't look authentic enough.
 Flash-forward nearly 30 years to when we took my daughter to the local shopping center for her first real, honest-to-goodness meeting with Saint Nick. The Santa that day? Some young kid, wearing blue-tinted eyeglasses, who could barely keep the sorry-looking white wig and whiskers on.
 Things have gotten better since then. A few years later, we took my daughter to see another Santa in downtown Meadville who was spot-on, although a bit skinny for the part. We later took her and her cousins to a breakfast with Santa at the Riverside Inn, and the guy playing the role was as good as it gets.
 I've paid closer attention to the Santa stand-ins since then, mainly because I had to do a lot of explaining to my daughter in order to convince her that the guy wearing the blue-tinted glasses really was a friend of Saint Nick and was helping him out.
 I often thought about what I would do if I encountered one of those really bad-looking Santas. Would I pull the guy aside and suggest that he either make a better effort or stand down? Would I tell the kids in line to go home because the \"real\" Santa wouldn't be visiting that day?
 Thankfully, I never had to do these things. All the Santas I've seen from my vantage point have done an excellent job in looking the part.
 Keep up the good work, and see you next December.

The conversation on climate change has gone on long enough where the ordinary Ghanaian should be able to tell you what climate change is about. But unfortunately, that’s not the case, some journalists in this country when invited to cover events organised on climate change, at the end of the day, tell their stories with the focus on some unpopular comments made by speakers at the event and forget about the main issue.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - At the United Nations, Russia and China say they strongly oppose the New Year's Eve attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. But Moscow and Beijing say they have decided to block a U.N. Security Council statement condemning that attack because it doesn't address the subsequent U.S. killing of Iran's top general. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia says Moscow agrees with the proposed U.S. statement condemning the embassy attack. However, he told reporters Monday that the focus must now be to "prevent developments going down the drain in the direction of a major conflict."

United´s captain for the evening Marcus Rashford restored some pride for the hosts to reduce the deficit 20 minutes from time, but they face a huge task when the sides meet again for the second leg on January 29.
 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer´s men had torn City apart on the counter-attack to shock the Premier League champions on home soil a month ago.
 That league defeat allied to another loss at Wolves over the festive season realistically ended City´s hopes of catching runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool, leaving Pep Guardiola´s men to focus on the domestic cups and Champions League.
 Guardiola showed his intent by naming a strong team but without a natural striker as Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus were left on the bench. The fluid front four of Silva, Mahrez, Raheem Sterling and Kevin de Bruyne were too fleet of foot and thought for a United defence without the injured Harry Maguire.
 An extra midfielder also helped City dominate possession and nullify United counter-attacks.
 City got their reward with a sumptuous strike from Silva to open the floodgates.
 The Portuguese international has struggled to reach the heights of a brilliant campaign as City won a domestic treble last season, but was back to his best as he smashed a shot into the top corner from outside the box.
 Silva turned creator for City´s second on 33 minutes as one pass split the United defence and Mahrez raced in behind Victor Lindelof before rounding David de Gea to slot into an empty net.
 Five minutes later it was 3-0 as De Bruyne left Phil Jones flat on the ground before his powerful shot was parried by De Gea into the path of the unfortunate Pereira, who could only turn the ball into his own net.
 Only De Gea´s brilliance and the profligacy of Sterling prevented the scoreline becoming even more embarrassing for Solskjaer before half-time.
 The Spanish goalkeeper spread himself to make a magnificent save from Silva before Sterling failed to turn home Kyle Walker´s inviting cross as his run without a goal against United stretched to 18 games.
 City eased up after the break but should still have extended their lead when De Gea saved well with his legs from Mahrez.
 Moments later, United grabbed a lifeline when they finally caught the visitors cold on the break as Mason Greenwood teed up Rashford to calmly slot into the far corner for his 17th goal of the season.
 But there was no late rally from the Red Devils to further cut City´s advantage as the blue side of Manchester celebrated a third straight win at Old Trafford and a fourth in five derbies on the road since Guardiola took charge.

In October 2018, President Kenyatta issued a public apology to small-scale entrepreneurs at a summit at Strathmore University over the government’s failure to provide a conducive environment for business. Subsequently, he made a commitment that the government would support SMEs through infrastructure development, including reliable and affordable electricity supply, favourable tax regime and responsive legal and policy frameworks.
 During Jamhuri celebrations last month, the President reiterated the government’s pledge to facilitate the growth of SMEs and, for good measure, did two things. First, he directed the Attorney-General, National Treasury, Kenya Revenue Authority and Judiciary to formulate a policy to waive court fees for commercial disputes under Sh1 million, which, essentially, targets small-scale traders. Secondly, he launched a mobile loan scheme, dubbed Stawi, that allows small-scale traders to obtain unsecured loans of Sh30,000-Sh250,000 at a discounted nine per cent interest.
 These provide tangible efforts by the government to boost SMEs, recognising the crucial role they play in the economy. Statistics show SMEs hire up to 75 per cent of the working population.
 Given this background, it’s difficult to reconcile the latest move by the very government to introduce Turnover Tax (TOT) on small businesses to be calculated at three per cent of the sales. Beginning January 1, KRA is set to collect this new tax, which is one of the revenue streams it’s pursuing to raise income.
 Tax is a civic duty. It provides the kitty from which the government runs its operations and provides services and infrastructure. In recent times, KRA has consecutively failed to achieve its targets. Consequently, the government has been forced into extensive borrowing, internally and externally, to meet its budget deficits.
 But the point of discussion is the level and extent of taxation. The citizens are overburdened by tax. Business people are worse off. Small-scale traders operate under very difficult conditions and hardly make ends meet. The government conjuring up a tax for them in a bid to raise its incomes is pushing its luck too far.
