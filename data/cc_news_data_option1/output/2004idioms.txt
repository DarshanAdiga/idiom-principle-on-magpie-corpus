VENICE, Fla. (WWSB) - People on Venice Avenue enjoying this beautiful Friday. For restaurants here they have extra reason to be happy, especially Daria Nafziger, owner of Ciao Gelato. Venice City Council giving the green light to allow her and others to expand their outside dining area on the sidewalk.“We only have seating capacity for six on the inside, so if we could add a couple extra tables that’s great," said Nafziger. Our neigbors right here have given us permission to set up tables in front of their location.”Restaurants can now set up tables and seats in front of neighboring businesses as long as they get permission. They also are required to maintain a six-foot wide pedestrian walkway.“Anything we can do to help any of our merchants, restaurants or otherwise is going to be to our advantage, as we try to reopen in a safe way," said Ron Feinsod, Mayor of the city of Venice. "And whether they are merchants on the island or off the island, it’s really important we look for ways to help all of them.”City council shot down the idea of closing down the street for outdoor dining, so the mayor says they went with the next best thing. Restaurants are still only allowed 50 percent capacity for indoor dining. It’s been a rough couple of months for Luca Cassani and his Cassariano Italian Eatery business. He tells ABC7, expanding his outdoor dining business will be a big help. “I feel good, obviously because my business would benefit completely," said Cassani. "I think it’s a great idea, I think especially for now it’s a good idea, it will benefit every other business I believe.”Copyright 2020 WWSB. All rights reserved.

Southeastern Conference schools will be able to bring football and basketball players back to campus for voluntary activities starting June 8 at the discretion of each university.The SEC’s announcement Friday is the latest sign that a college football season will be launched in some form this fall. The move comes two days after the NCAA Division I Council voted to lift a moratorium on voluntary workouts on campus by football and basketball players, effective June 1.Other conferences are expected to follow suit, though decisions could be left to individual schools.“At this time, we are preparing to begin the fall sports season as currently scheduled, and this limited resumption of voluntary athletic activities on June 8 is an important initial step in that process,” SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said.SEC officials noted any workouts would take place “under strict supervision of designated university personnel and safety guidelines developed by each institution.” They referred to June 8 as the start of “transition period that will allow student-athletes to gradually adapt to full training and sports activity after this recent period of inactivity.”Permitted actions are limited by the NCAA to voluntary activities supervised by strength and conditioning personnel.“This is an important first step toward having a season this fall, and we will continue to collectively work together as our top priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our student-athletes, coaches and staff,” Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said in a statement.The SEC decided to resume athletic activities with the guidance of a league task force that includes public health, infectious disease and sports medicine professionals from each of the league’s 14 member schools.The task force prepared a series of best practices for screening, testing, monitoring, tracing, social distancing and maintaining clean environments to serve as a guide for each school.Recommendations included testing of symptomatic team members (including athletes, coaches and staffers) as well as screening athletes before they arrive on campus within 72 hours of entering athletic facilities and on a daily basis once they resume athletic activities.Other recommendations include immediate isolation of team members who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or are under investigation, followed by contact tracing under Centers for Disease Control and local public health guidelines.“Health and safety have been our top priority as we’ve gone about this planning process, and we’ll continue to follow guidance from medical experts and health officials as we navigate the coming weeks,” Tennessee athletic director Phillip Fulmer said. “Our staff and student-athletes should be prepared for a ‘new normal,’ as we’ll be implementing changes to how everyone accesses and uses our facilities."A Big 12 Conference moratorium on in-person team activities and voluntary workouts currently goes through May 31, a few days after spring meetings by leaders of the conference's 10 schools who have discussed options in bi-weekly calls since the pandemic outbreak shut down sports more than two months ago.Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby has said football teams would need six weeks or so to get ready to play, including some time for players to get reacclimated before a traditional preseason camp. Based on the current schedule for season openers on Labor Day weekend, that would mean teams would need to be back together by around mid-July.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday he thinks college football will return on schedule with at least some spectators. Abbott has already issued new rules to allow youth sports leagues to resume in June and for some professional leagues to hold events without spectators.“Once we get to college football season, our goal right now is to have college football season start as planned, with fans in stands,” Abbott said in an interview with Austin television station KXAN. “What we don’t know is what the capacity level would be.”___AP Sports Writers Stephen Hawkins, Jim Vertuno, Teresa M.

Unfortunately for Levy, he didn't win any of them, tarnishing an unprecedented run with the Buffalo Bills that began with a bitter 20-19 loss to the New York Giants in the 1991 title game. After Scott Norwood's potential winning field goal went wide right, Levy and the Bills never came so close to a championship. They lost the next three Super Bowls by an average of three touchdowns. Too bad for Levy we can't count his two titles coaching in the Canadian Football League.

Roy Melvin Dice, Jr., 91, of Palmyra, went to be with Jesus on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 at Londonderry Village, Palmyra. He was born June 21, 1928 in Palmyra to the late Roy Melvin, Sr. and Mable Irene (Buck) Dice. He was predeceased on May 30, 2009 by his wife of 61 years, Faye Geraldine (Summers) Dice. He is survived by his wife, Marilyn Rebecca (Gluck) Myers Dice. He graduated from Palmyra High School '47, Grace College '56, Grace Seminary in '59 and earned a Masters Degree from Temple University '71\. He was ordained as a minister by the National Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches '62 and began pastoring churches in Winona, MN and Cedar Rapids, IA. He was the first pastor of Telford, Lititz and Myerstown Grace Brethren Churches. He also served as interim pastor of Lancaster and Palmyra Grace Brethren Churches. Roy taught elementary school at Pine Street and Lawn Elementary Schools in Pa before he became Head 6th Grade Science Teacher at Milton Hershey School for 24 years. He was a humble servant with an infectious smile and sense of humor that would light up a room and bring so much joy to those around him. His love for Jesus Christ directed his time, his many talents and his unconditional love for all. He is survived by his loving daughter, Lynne L. Swider and husband Thomas of Harrisburg; two grandsons, Lt Colonel Robert T. Hines, Jr. (USAF) and a NASA astronaut (wife Kelli) and Michael John Dice Hines, Assistant Principal of Sam Houston High School, all of Houston, TX; three granddaughters, Catherine "Cat", Sarah and Julia Hines; two step-children, Melissa Burrous of Wellsboro and William Judy of Millersburg. He was predeceased by two sisters, Thelma Dice and Catherine Kiscadden. Roy attended The Evangelical Free Church of Hershey until his health declined to the point where he was unable to do so. There he participated in many different activities including conducting Sunday School classes. He enjoyed many activities throughout his lifetime, including tennis, social gatherings and travel. He worked with Bob Neff Tours as a Tour Leader in the 1990's and was able to lead groups over the years to Russia, Germany, France and the Holy Land. When he retired from Milton Hershey School he continued his lifelong devotion to children by generously driving many qualified students from the school, when needed, to various colleges and universities along the East Coast. He also enjoyed a position at Hershey Park where he shared responsibilities with his oldest grandson as tram drivers for those arriving and departing the park. This was another way he maintained his lifelong devotion to the youth of our world. This writing would not be complete without the heartfelt expression of gratitude to the staff at Londonderry Village for their dedication to Roy's physical wellbeing, maintaining his love of life and encouraging his sense of humor throughout the later years of his life. A Celebration of Life will be held at a later date. Private burial will take place in Gravel Hill Cemetery, Palmyra with Pastor Dave Martin officiating. Rothermel-Finkenbinder Funeral Home &amp; Crematory, Inc., 25 West Pine Street, Palmyra, PA 17078 has been entrusted with the arrangements. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in his honor to Londonderry Village Good Samaritan Fund, 1200 Grubb Road, Palmyra, PA 17078 or Hershey Free Church, Compassion Fund, 330 Hilltop Road, Hummelstown, PA 17036.

 In January, police revealed a previously unreleased photograph of initials on a black leather belt — either an HM or WH, depending on the angle — that they say was handled by an unknown suspect.
 Last fall, state officials gave investigators the green light to ask the FBI to deploy genetic genealogy, a technique in which genetic profiles are run though databases to find potential relatives of a homicide victim or suspect. It's that technology that led to the woman's identification, police said.

While social distancing guidelines have been lessen for regions across the United States, socializing opportunities are becoming more apparent. With the Memorial Day weekend fast approaching, area residents and guests are expected to gather around regional lakes and rivers.
   
 Not to lessen the importance of social distancing and personal hygiene, the Oklahoma Highway Safety Office has issued a warning to individuals planning to enjoy natural sites in and around the state.
   
 "If you're headed to the lake, river, or down the road to celebrate the long weekend, make sure you pack a plan to get home safe," a release issued Thursday said.
   
 "During the 2019 Memorial Day holiday period in Oklahoma, two people were killed in crashes, one of those was in an alcohol-related crash. That's down significantly from 11 people killed in 2018. While that decline is great news, Oklahoma still lost two people last year in preventable crashes," the release continued.
   
 OHSO stressed the importance of being prepared and having the necessary supplies handy before taking a hike or visiting area bodies of water.
   
 "We will have troopers on the roads, in the water, and in the air making sure people are being safe this holiday weekend," said Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lieutenant Chris Arnall in the release. "We want to make sure everyone enjoys the time with friends and family, but we want them all to make it home safe."
   
 The department also wanted to remind people that, "The Oklahoma Highway Safety Office (OHSO) and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol want to remind everyone that law enforcement is still on duty and will be looking for impaired drivers this weekend."
   
 The Oklahoma Highway Patrol's marine enforcement division, Troop W, will have all available troopers out and working on area lakes this Memorial Day weekend.
   
 "We urge everyone to consider safety on the water as well as on the roads," said Troop W Captain, Mike Sharp. "Have a life jacket onboard your vessel for each passenger, children 12 years old or younger must wear a life jacket if they are on a vessel that is less than 26 feet in length. Never operate boats or personal watercraft while under the influence of alcohol or drugs."
   
 The Oklahoma Highway Patrol will team up with local law enforcement across the state to put a special emphasis on impaired driving enforcement this weekend. Several agencies in the areas around popular lakes and rivers will have officers working with the ENDUI Oklahoma Impaired Driving Liaison troopers to get impaired drivers off the roads.
   
 "We understand everyone wants to have a good time. We just ask that you follow certain rules and use common sense to avoid a tragedy that could have been prevented," said Captain Sharp.
