The game's first golden scoring chance fell to Burnley's Chris Wood, and he made an absolute mess of it in the 14th minute.

Somehow, against all logic, Wood put his effort wide of the post and let Arsenal off the hook for more lackadaisical defending.

“If you don’t have internet access, you can’t reach out across the world as a small business and do the kind of things that other people do who are in bigger cities,” he said.
 The Amicalola EMC-Ellijay Telephone partnership isn’t the only rural Georgia broadband project to move forward this month. On Dec. 3, Comcast announced it had completed an expansion of broadband to more than 2,500 homes and businesses in Haralson County.
 For the EMCs, the green light came last year when the General Assembly passed legislation sponsored by Gooch that for the first time authorized EMCs to provide broadband service to their customers.
 Since then, besides the Amicalola EMC project, Carroll EMC and Colquitt EMC have announced broadband projects in their areas of the state.
 LaGrange-based Diverse Power became the first EMC after the passage of Gooch’s Senate Bill 2 to delve into broadband last March when it announced plans to run 150 miles of fiber-optic cable to serve 600 customers in five rural counties in Southwest Georgia.
 Those three will join Blue Ridge EMC and Habersham EMC, which started offering broadband several years ago, even though the legal authority to do so prior to Senate Bill 2 was unclear.
 Historically, bringing broadband service to rural Georgia has been a difficult proposition for the EMCs.
 “When you get down into these rural areas, there’s just not many people, maybe five to six people per mile or, in our case, meters,” said Dennis Chastain, president and CEO of Georgia EMC, the trade association for local EMCs representing about 4.4 million Georgians. “If there’s not that many people there, it’s hard to cover the cost of building the line.”
 That was certainly the case when Moultrie-based Colquitt EMC began considering providing broadband to customers in its largely rural seven-county service territory, said Danny Nichols, the EMC’s president and CEO.
 “We recognized early on we couldn’t go into the broadband business on our own. The math doesn’t work,” he said. “But we couldn’t play ostrich and put our heads in the sand.”
 What changed this year was the coronavirus pandemic, which made getting high- speed internet connectivity into rural communities even more critical. Suddenly, companies were forced to rely on virtual meetings to conduct business and schools had to resort to distance learning.

 And the former Concord Spider is already starting to turn heads.
 With limited practice time, Alexander has earned respect and praise from the Suns’ biggest star, Devin Booker, and their head coach. And that means everything for any rookie, let alone one who wasn’t drafted and is in training camp just hoping to make an impact.
 According to the Arizona Republic newspaper, Alexander got to test his skills during a game of 1-on-1 against Booker this week. And while Alexander came away impressed by the All-Star guard, he also left with some rave reviews of his own.

"We didn’t get going until after the first 30 minutes. You can’t do that in the Premier League or you get punished – like we did. The good thing is we reacted well. We dominated and should have scored one or more two. I’m disappointed with the start, pleased with the reaction. We’ll have to look at it but it’s not like us," Henderson told our partners in the UK at Sky Sports. "I don’t want to make excuses. I’ll let you talk about the amount of games teams are playing. We flew back from Denmark, prepared well. For whatever reason we didn’t start well. Maybe we could have won the game on another day. [At half-time Jurgen Klopp said] We need to start the half like we finished the first half. A few of us weren’t happy with the start. We gave everything in the second half. Fulham made it difficult to create chances. When you can’t win, don’t lose. But I felt we were good enough to get the three points."

Belief: Human touch leaves a scent on a baby bird that may cause the mother to abandon it. Not true. Most birds have a poor sense of smell and couldn't detect human scent on their young. However, that doesn't give us the green light to cuddle every baby bird we find in spring. Young birds can have mites that they could pass on to human handlers and excessive disturbance of young may cause a parental bird to abandon her brood and try another nesting attempt in a safer place. If cats or other dangers can't be kept away from a young flightless bird you find, move it quickly to a safer location (in the same area where it was found), then let bird parental care continue.

 Makale Foreman scored his first points of the game on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer that gave California its only lead of the game and a 72-70 win over San Francisco on Sunday.
 Foreman missed his first six shots of the game, including five attempts from 3-point range, for the Golden Bears (3-4).
 Andre Kelly led Cal with 22 points and seven rebounds. Grant Anticevich added 18 points and seven boards, and Matt Bradley scored 17 points.
 Jamaree Bouyea had 11 of his career-high 24 points while the Dons (5-3) jumped to their largest lead at 21-9 lead, and Bouyea closed the half with a three- quarter-court heave that gave San Francisco a 37-29 lead.
 The Bears three times closed the deficit to one in the second half, the third time with 16.1 seconds left when Bradley drove and dished to Kelly for an open layup.

The ultimately more important aspect is that the delusions keep Yuka going when she's ready to give in. (We also get her backstory in the process, which is a standard “played the part to fit in” scenario.) That's good, because Iu finds that carelessly straying out onto a not-completely-frozen pond is a bad idea, Kusue cannot revive because she has frozen to death, and Yusuke, who revives after his fall and wanders around in a dungeon for a while, has to deal with worm poop before literally becoming dinner for another worm-like critter. These kinds of complications are to be expected, as where's the tension if the heroes don't go down to the wire on this? The minor surprise is the sudden appearance of a female magic-user riding a giant cat, who further seems to know about “players” (as she puts it). She is also dusky-skinned when no one else in this setting has been. Who she is and why she knows such information is a mystery for another day (and probably another season), however, as she doesn't go with Yuka when the quest ends.
