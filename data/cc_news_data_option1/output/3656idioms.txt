ISLAMABAD: JUI-F chief Fazlur Rehman Sunday said the opposition had no option but to break from the traditional and routine decisions and take a strong decision in the All Parties Conference.
 “ Traditional and routine decision could not fulfill the purpose of the All Parties Conference,” he said while talking to reporters after meeting former prime minister and President Pakistan Muslim League (PML) Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain.
 Talking to the media after the meeting, Fazl said he had met Ch Shujaat at the wedding ceremony of Senator Talha Mehmood’s daughter and had told him that he would visit his residence to inquire after him, as during the time of COVID-19 he could not meet him. He said no politics was discussed in the meeting. He said if women were not safe in the country then what could be expected from the government. “As long as this selected government is power, neither the economy will improve nor the future of our youths will be safe,” he said, adding that government representatives were coming out with such statements as to add insult to injury. He said inflation and unemployment were increasing and the economic situation was before everyone but the rulers were busy talking about the State of Madina. He questioned government’s silence over the wave of sectarianism in the country.
 Fazl said if all the institutions worked within their ambit, then the country would see an improvement. To a question about the scheduled APC of the opposition, he said the opposition would gather in September at the APC where strict decisions should be taken. To another question, he said there was a need for reforms in the PTI instead of police.
 Meanwhile, Ch Shujaat Hussain said every subject except politics came under discussion during his meeting with Fazl. In a statement, he said he told Fazl that Coronavirus was a warning from Almighty Allah that had changed the world standards and all worldly super powers were helpless before it despite scientific and technological advancement. Shujaat further said his father Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi had very close relations with Fazl’s father Mufti Mehmud. He said his meeting with Fazl was held in a pleasant atmosphere and they had a detailed discussion on the pandemic.

Y el principal motivo es, como siempre, economico. El articulo de _The New York Times_ en cuestion describia la distribucion del poder blanco en el mando a cuenta de las reivindicaciones de _Black Lives Matter_. Asi que hay una paradoja peligrosa en una logica que nos lleva a negar la existencia de razas cuando millones de personas sufren condiciones de vida injustas precisamente por su identificacion con una raza. Seria posible establecer una analogia, salvando las distancias, con la cuestion de genero: los comulgantes del mundo _queer_ reivindican la idea de genero fluido o no binario, incluso la libre adopcion del genero por parte del individuo como artefacto social o cultural generalmente impuesto a tenor de tradiciones irracionales, sin una base biologica real; sin embargo, mientras las mujeres sigan siendo discriminadas o victimas de violencia por el hecho de serlo, convendra seguir diciendo que hay mujeres, reconociendolas como tal, asistiendo en lo que sea necesario para la correccion de los desequilibrios y la eliminacion del muy existente techo de cristal.

FOXBORO -- Following the Patriots win over Miami, tempers flared with Cam Newton and several opposing Dolphins defensive players on Sunday.
 It's tough to tell what exactly started it all, but Newton could be seen arguing with Kyle Van Noy, who appeared to push him, and Elandon Roberts, who got in his face. The Patriots quarterback had to be held back and then held back against when Christian Wilkins grabbed and pulled off one of Newton's chains.
 Both Julian Edelman and Rex Burkhead could be seen holding Newton back as he searched for his chain on the turf.
 "I still got my chain. I got two of them. They were reaching for my chain though," Newton said. "They were reaching for my chain. I think that kind of got up under my skin, but throughout it all, man, listen, I don't want nothing taken away from a great team win. I don't want to be selfish to kind of focus for us as a team or me personally, a lot of tempers can flare. I was just teasing with coaches letting them no that College Park almost came out. Throughout it all, it was just fun and games."
 Newton certainly frustrated the Dolphins defense. He completed 79% of his passes, but did most damage on the ground with two rushing touchdowns. After the game, while speaking to the media, Newton did take a small jab at Wilkins, who once went viral for doing a split after a Clemson's National Championship in 2017
 "You just have to realize who you're talking to... I realized I was talking to a person known for doing splits," Newton said. "So that was uncharacteristic of myself to keep on going back and forth. But at the end of the day, it's football. No matter who it is, I play with a competitive edge and I expect the other team, too. At the end of the day, anything outside of that, it's all about respect. I don't disrespect nobody. I don't want anybody to disrespect me, but at the end of the day, we got the thing that was most valuable."

I don't offer this in an attempt to excuse unacceptable behavior, but the customers you describe appear to be so upset and on edge that they can no longer control their emotions. Yes -- some of them are also entitled, impatient and arrogant. Personally, I think that when a customer acts out, the store manager should step in and remove that person from the premises. Some stores have increased their security staff to deal with this. If enough managers did this, customers would be put on notice that bad behavior won't be tolerated.

NEW YORK -- At a U.S. Open unlike any other, Dominic Thiem constructed a comeback the likes of which hadn't been seen in 71 years.
 After dropping the opening two sets against Alexander Zverev on Sunday at a nearly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium -- fans were banned because of the coronavirus pandemic -- Thiem slowly but surely turned things around for a 2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (6) victory across more than four hours to earn his first major championship.
 The 27-year-old from Austria is the first man to win the American Grand Slam tournament after trailing 2-0 in sets in the final since Pancho Gonzalez did it against Ted Schroeder in 1949 at an event then known as the U.S. Championships.
 Not only that, but in a fitting finish to an unprecedented two weeks, this match was decided by a fifth-set tiebreaker, something that had never happened in the final.
 When it ended on a groundstroke flubbed by Zverev, a weary Thiem collapsed on his back way behind the baseline. Zverev -- who himself came within two points of the victory -- walked around the net to offer a handshake and hug to his pal, two gestures rarely spotted in this era of social distancing.
 Thiem had come in 0-3 in Grand Slam finals, but always came up against Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic in those others. This time, he was the favorite and came out jittery, but eventually worked his way out of that, while Zverev went from cool and confident to passive and pushed around.
 The fifth set was just as back-and-forth as the other four, the mistakes rising with the tension and the history in the offing.
 Thiem broke in the opening game when Zverev shanked a pair of forehands.
 Zverev broke right back -- and pierced the silence with a rare cry of "Come on!" \-- when Thiem double-faulted.
 Then it was Zverev's turn to nose ahead, breaking for a 5-3 lead when Thiem sent a down-the-line backhand wide and leaned over, gasping for air.
 But with a chance to serve out the biggest win of his nascent career, Zverev faltered, getting broken right back when he pushed a volley into the net.
 That began a three-game run for Thiem, who broke to lead 6-5, earning his own chance to serve for it, when Zverev netted a backhand, followed by a long forehand.
 A trainer came out to check on Thiem's right leg during the ensuing changeover. He couldn't seal the deal then, either, and eventually needed a trio of match points to end it.
 While this was the No. 7-ranked Zverev's first Slam final, this was the first one that Thiem was supposed to win, following losses to Nadal at the French Open in 2018 and 2019, then to Djokovic at the Australian Open this February -- back before the pandemic upended the world and prompted a U.S. Open with zero fans and regular COVID-19 testing.
 Instead of wild applause and loud shouts greeting great exchanges, the soundtrack at Arthur Ashe Stadium mainly came from outside the largest court in tennis, courtesy of roaring airplanes, rumbling trains, revving car engines, honking horns and wailing sirens. There was the occasional polite applause from the dozens of tournament workers allowed in the stands -- and, deep into the match, yells from the players' entourages.
 But the louder crowd noise heard by TV viewers was fake, added by the broadcaster.
 Unable to draw from support in what's always been an electric environment, on an evening that felt more like a glorified practice session than a match with so much at stake, both men were sluggish at times, listeless, even.
 Normally, the U.S. Open closes each Grand Slam season, but what about 2020 has been normal?
 "Strange times," Thiem called it.
 Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, Wimbledon was canceled for the first time since World War II, while the French Open was postponed from its originally scheduled May start and now will begin in two weeks.
 So the tennis world quickly shifts to European clay after an unusual two- tournament hard-court doubleheader in Flushing Meadows -- called "a crazy idea" by U.S. Tennis Association CEO Mike Dowse on Sunday.
 The U.S. Open was preceded at its site by the Western & Southern Open, which moved from Ohio to New York as part of a "controlled environment" to limit travel.
 Another way in which this whole event was different: A member of the Big Three of men's tennis -- Roger Federer, Nadal or Djokovic -- had won the preceding 13 major trophies.
 So Thiem took advantage of the chance to sneak into the club of champions.
