LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) — Louisiana residents are once again dodging overturned cars on the roads, trudging through knee-deep water to find their homes flooded and pledging to rebuild after Hurricane Delta blew through the besieged part of the state. Delta made landfall Friday with top winds of 100 mph. It then moved over Lake Charles, a city where Hurricane Laura damaged nearly every building in late August. No deaths from Delta have been reported so far. But a leading cause of the 32 attributed to Laura was carbon monoxide poisoning from generators used in buildings without electricity. Delta weakened into a tropical depression, but forecasters warned of flash flood and storm surge danger in areas from Texas to Mississippi.

The reason it's problematic there is there's sound going on all around you. It's hard to focus on the person that you want to hear. ... Young people have less trouble with that. Their auditory systems are more able to filter out unwanted conversation. But restaurants, unfortunately, take advantage of this. They tend to turn up the sound as the night goes on, both to make diners talk less and, therefore, drink more, and also to drive out older, lingering customers who don't run up ... big checks. Get them out and turn the tables over faster. ... And then, perversely, paradoxically, even people who hate loud restaurants tend to avoid really quiet ones, because they figure, it's so quiet, how can it possibly be any good?

Once you've engaged in self-reflection to identify the values you hold dear, Kraemer says, then you need to find a solid sounding board who will tell you whether you are living those values. This could be a family member, close colleague, or religious leader, for example.
 "Find people whose values you appreciate, whom you admire, who can give you an honest appraisal of whether you're on track or not," he said. And if they say you're not, you need to engage in self-reflection to figure out how to get there.
 Soliciting feedback is a key leadership skill in any context, Kraemer explains. Yet, as you rise through the ranks at an organization, it can often get more difficult to get anything other than sugar-coated counsel.
 One way to ensure you're getting straight talk is to make sure that you're interacting with everyone in the company. This means going well beyond your own team.

Riot police swiftly detained dozens at a protest march in Belarus on Sunday after strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko raised hopes for change by meeting jailed opposition figures.
 Large numbers of black-clad masked police, internal troops and men in plainclothes emerged from unmarked minibuses and ran towards protesters in the capital Minsk, pulling some to the ground, witness footage on independent news sites showed.
 The Viasna rights group, which monitors detentions at political protests, said at least 39 people had been detained in Minsk as well as around a dozen in other cities.
 Among those detained were journalists from Russia's TASS state news agency, although they were later released, the agency reported.
 Protesters have gathered every weekend since Lukashenko claimed victory in August 9 elections over a popular opposition candidate, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claims to have been the true winner.
 The European Union and the United States have refused to recognise Lukashenko's inauguration for a sixth term, saying the polls were not free and fair and condemning alleged abuse and torture of detained protesters.
 The United States and the EU have hit Belarus with sanctions for allegedly rigging the vote and orchestrating the crackdown on protesters, targeting key officials -- but not Lukashenko himself.
 Protesters came out with umbrellas on a rainy afternoon for the latest in a series of mass protests urging Lukashenko to step down, called the "March of Pride".
 It came after the 66-year-old authoritarian leader, in power since 1994, on Saturday took the unusual step of visiting a group of recently jailed opposition politicians, officially to discuss his plans for constitutional reforms.
 The opposition hailed this as a sign that Lukashenko senses his weakness and is seeking some compromise with the protest movement.
 However the authorities on Sunday ordered a reduction of mobile internet service and sent military vehicles into the centre of the capital Minsk.
 Several thousand protesters dodged police who closed off main streets to prevent the columns of marchers from reaching the city centre.
 Police used stun grenades and water cannon, spraying plain and coloured water at demonstrators.
 Some of those detained were wrapped in the red-and-white protest flag, footage posted by the Tut.by news site showed.
 One man had his head bandaged at the scene, the Belsat news site reported.

 The Muckleshoot Tribe in August donated $35,000 to the Reagan Fund, which works to elect Republicans to the state House. A month earlier, the tribe gave $40,000 to the Leadership Council, the committee associated with state Senate Republicans.
 Some tribes also are leading contributors in Washington to federal campaign coffers.
 The Puyallup Tribe is in a class by itself for campaign contributions so far on federal campaigns this year since January 2019, with more than $2.2 million spent, far and away more than any other Washington tribe, according to data from the Federal Election Commission reports of contributions for 2019-20.
 That includes the top six biggest contributions from Washington to the Democratic National Committee, totaling $639,000 since September 2019.

LAFAYETTE, La. -- Ripping tarps from damaged roofs and scattering massive piles of storm debris in the wind and water, Hurricane Delta inflicted a new round of destruction in Louisiana communities still reeling along a path Hurricane Laura carved just six weeks earlier.
 Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph before rapidly weakening over land.
 By Saturday morning, it dwindled to a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, but storm surge and flash floods continued to pose dangers across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.
 Mississippi also got its fair share of rain overnight.
 Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole -- only 15 miles or so from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. It then moved directly over Lake Charles, a waterfront city about 30 miles inland where the earlier hurricane damaged nearly every home and building, and where moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.
 Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter spoke with The Associated Press as he rode out Delta's arrival downtown. He said tarps were flying off homes across the city, and piles of wreckage were being blown around, some of it floating in the surge of ocean water.
 "I'm in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building," Hunter said. "It's pretty intense."
 Water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack's bedroom in Lake Charles as he tried to sleep through the storm. Jack said a tarp covering roof damage caused by Laura hadn't blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.
 "It's raining real hard; it's flooding; the wind is strong," Jack said Friday night. "I'm OK. I'm not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well."
 In Lake Arthur, Delta's winds peeled shingles off the roof of L'Banca Albergo, an eight-room boutique hotel in what used to be a bank.
 "I probably don't have a shingle left on the top of this hotel," owner Roberta Palermo said as the winds gusted outside.
 The electricity was out and Palermo said she could see pieces of metal coming off the roof of a 100-year-old building across the street. Unsecured trash cans were flying around the streets.
 "There is a lot of power lines down all over the place, there's ... really deep water in certain spots," said hotel guest Johnny Weaver. He had been out in the weather with his friends earlier and one friend's car was stranded in the water.
 Tropical storm force winds reached 160 miles outward from the storm's center early Saturday. A 68 mph gust was reported at LSU's Tiger Stadium overnight, and a 55 mph gust was reported at Adams County airport in Natchez, Mississippi.
 In Galveston, Texas, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from where the center made landfall, winds toppled trees, street signs and two homes under construction, and with dunes flattened by earlier storms, the surge reached beneath raised houses. Large swells and rip currents prompted beach closures as far west as the mouth of the Rio Grande.
 Delta also downed trees across Mississippi, including one that landed on a Jackson-based WLBT-TV vehicle with a news crew inside. No one was injured.
 Forecasters said the storm would move into the Tennessee Valley Saturday and into Sunday as a tropical depression.
 In Delta's wake, about 740,000 homes and businesses were without power in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi early Saturday, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.
 Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, made the record books when it struck the Gulf Coast. It was the first Greek- alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental U.S. And it became the 10th named storm to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a century-old record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.
 Delta was the fourth named storm to strike Louisiana in 2020. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip just three days before Laura struck. And Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.
 Some who rode out Laura hunkered down again with Delta. In Lafayette, about 75 miles east of Lake Charles, Jeanne-Marie Gove could hear debris hitting her door as her patio gate banged open and shut. She said the roof from a trailer at the mobile home park behind her apartment was torn off and tossed down the sidewalk.
 "The wind is much worse than what Hurricane Laura brought," Gove said in a message on Twitter.
 "The wind gusts are making the glass from our windows bow inward," she added. "It's pretty scary."
 Hunter said he thought more people evacuated for Delta than Laura, reducing emergency calls during the worst of the storm. Across the disaster area, people could only wait for the waters to recede before getting a full view of the damage.
 "I believe that Delta could actually be more of a flooding issue than Laura was from what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing right now in the thick of it," the mayor said Friday night.
 "We really just need people not to forget about us," Hunter said. "We are going to be in the recovery mode for months and probably years from these two hurricanes. It's just unprecedented and historic what has happened to us."

Milton Arlen Asher            Milton Arlen Asher, an award-winning jazz woodwind musician, died on Friday, October 2, 2020 after a short illness. Born on a small farm in Missouri on Tuesday, May 7, 1929, Arlen quickly showed a fascination with music from the radio. At age 11, when his father died, he began playing professionally in nightclubs to make ends meet. He met the love of his life, Joetha Jean Callison, in 1950, and they married shortly afterward. Their sons were born in 1954 and 1956.      After attending Iowa State University with a degree in radio and TV broadcasting, he accepted a job as director-announcer at KNME in 1958 and the family moved to Albuquerque. In 1965, he left broadcasting to establish a teaching studio, where he taught woodwinds and imparted his joy of music to thousands of students, including his granddaughters. He also visited Jo's first grade classes & introduced many schoolchildren to music.      In 1981, Arlen and Jo moved to an off-the-grid solar adobe house they built themselves south of Santa Fe. He continued playing and recording music in his in-house studio there and teaching in Santa Fe.      Throughout his 80-year career, Arlen played with numerous local and national jazz musicians and groups, recording both solo albums and collaborations. He continued playing professionally until the past year.      The family is thankful to have had a father and grandfather who was so kind and compassionate in his public and private life. Although he was a superb musician who had many professional opportunities, he always put his family first, and he frequently expressed his love.      Arlen was predeceased by his wife of almost 60 years, Joetha Jean Callison Asher, and by his older son, Terry Asher. He is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Kelly and Donna Asher, and grandchildren Melissa Asher and her husband Maxwell Mianecki, and Kathleen Asher. He is also mourned by Connie Farley and by his many other close friends.      In lieu of flowers, please vote. Donations can be made to the Outpost's Arlen Asher Jazz Scholarship, KSFR, or Women for Women International. A Memorial Service is being planned for 2021, once the danger of the pandemic has lessened. The family is grateful to Arlen's many friends and fans for their outpouring of love and support. Please visit our online guest book for Arlen at      www.FrenchFunerals.com

With an expected contribution of $400 million in revenue, $70 million in adjusted EBITDA and $28 million in net earnings, the deal looks compelling. The 2 times sales multiple marks a big discount compared to the 7 times multiple at which DNB trades. This is in part explained by Bisnode's EBITDA margins seen at just 17%, while DNB reports margins in the mid-40s. Even after adjusting for the differences in EBITDA margins, the EBITDA multiple paid for Bisnode looks quite compelling as the company undoubtedly aims to create some synergies (both in costs and revenues) to create real value from here.
 This is recognized by investors as shares essentially rose by $2 overnight to $28 upon the deal announcement. This implies that the price paid for Bisnode is actually equivalent to the jump in the value of Dun & Bradstreet, making it very evident that investors think that the company has made a great deal.
 While the $818 million deal is essentially a bolt-on one, valued at roughly 6% of the pre-deal valuation of Dun & Bradstreet itself, it shows the commitment of the company to continue to improve the business. This comes after a quite strong second-quarter results.
 Despite these early gains, in terms of a solid second-quarter earnings report and a sound deal, I am still a bit cautious on the back of the valuation argument. Hence, I continue to treat the shares with caution here and now, yet will continue to monitor the situation from here onward.

It appears that one of the most glaring missteps in the design of the new flight control system was relying on information from just a single angle of attack (AoA) sensor for MCAS to activate. AoA sensors are small vanes on the nose of the plane that measure the pitch of the aircraft as it moves into the headwind. If the the AoA senses the plane is pitched up too high, MCAS will automatically and repeatedly force the nose of the plane down. And that's exactly what happened to both planes that crashed, except the sensor was wrong. Indonesian investigators found a Lion Air maintenance crew installed a new faulty AoA sensor the day before the doomed flight, and failed to recalibrate it and test it.

Washington coach Ron Rivera spoke last week about quarterback Dwayne Haskins having a future in the organization despite being benched just four games into this coaching regime, but few executives around the NFL are buying it. The situation between the quarterback, who was drafted 15th overall just 16 months ago, and Rivera's staff is already fairly toxic, and multiple sources within the organization believe a trade by the end of the month is the most likely outcome.
 Some rival executives have already begun looking at film of the former Ohio State star, anticipating him being moved in the coming weeks, with Kyle Allen \-- who has deep ties to this coaching staff -- taking over as starter, veteran Alex Smith now the No. 2 quarterback and Haskins demoted all the way to third string.
 Several sources close to Haskins have advised him that a trade would be far and away the best outcome possible, ideally to a solid franchise with an experienced veteran QB the 23-year-old could learn from. Haskins was not drafted by this regime, which was not high on him coming out of college. He is not a fit in their system, and his personality has rubbed them the wrong way since early on. Sources say with almost no practice time now and likely to be a healthy scratch many weeks, it's difficult for Haskins to envision a future for himself in Washington, where his development has never felt like a priority dating back to last season, when soon-to-be-fired coach Jay Gruden threw him into regular season games before many believed he was ready.

First, these communities are more likely to work jobs that force them to interact face to face with others, making them more likely to contract the virus, he said. Second, the burden of systemic racism in this country has contributed to chronic health problems for many in these communities, putting them at higher risk of death or other severe outcomes when they do become infected.
