For 2020, the company expected sales growth at around 3% as adjusted earnings per share were seen up by around 3%, seen around $5.00-$5.15 per share. This suggests some modest margin pressure as share repurchases most likely would be responsible for the majority of the expected earnings per share growth.
 With sales growth seen up low single digits the outlook essentially revealed some expected further margin deleverage. Trading around $115 per share, shares traded at 23 times earnings which is a steep multiple given the modest growth.
 The positive, or potential for Walmart would be the company returning to even the lower end of the 5-6% operating margin range, which the company achieved in recent years. Even if the company would return to the lower end of that range, operating earnings of $27 billion would translate into earnings of around $6.50 per share. If achieved, this $1.50 per share boost to earnings would reduce valuation multiples to about 18 times earnings. That said, achieving a point improvement in operating margins is a daunting task.
 The reason for that is that continued growth in e-commerce (which is a lower margin business) furthermore comes alongside the fact that sales of the stores are flat at best, a trend seen by many omnichannel operators. Hence, I believed that 3-4% operating margins were the new norm, not 5-6% as was seen in the past.
 ## The Start Of The Year
 The first quarter for Walmart was a very eventful one of course given the Covid-19 impact, really starting to make an impact in March. The company reported very strong first quarter results with Walmart benefiting from formidable e-commerce capabilities as the fact that is stores remained open, being labeled as essential, even as it sells many non-essential items.
 The company reported first quarter comparable sales growth of 10.0% for the US Walmart operations, as e-commerce sales were up 74% for Walmart US, yet of course growth was driven by the back-end of the quarter. Growth at Sam's Club came in at 12.0% on a comparable basis, which is impressive as e-commerce sales were up ¨just¨ 40% and the unit saw a 410 basis point headwind from tobacco sales being ended. International sales were up just 3.4% yet that is a bit misleading with currency headwinds reducing sales by about 4 points as the company furthermore reports international sales with a month lag, a key factor in this environment.

Consumer Electronics Association President Gary Shapiro says his association is only looking for voluntary incentive auctions of "some" of the broadcast spectrum. "We're not saying get rid of over-the-air, free broadcasting," he told C-SPAN during a taping of its _Communicators_ series. He also says that new legislation targeting online pirates could instead "basically shut down the Internet in a very large way."
 Shapiro said there is plenty of spectrum available in each market. He said auctioning that broadcast spectrum could bring anywhere between $15 billion and $40 billion to the treasury.
 He said that it is a mathematical certainty that, long-term, wireless devices will not work as they are expected to without more spectrum, including being able to watch full-motion video, like C-SPAN, while he is traveling on a train.
 Asked if device-makers, like his members, don't also have a responsibility to make their devices more spectrum-efficient, he said "absolutely," and added that there was "every incentive" to do so. He said that included relying more on local wi-fi nets. But he insisted that when most people have smart phones and tablets, the country will need a system to support them.
 Shapiro said he thought that if the supercommittee does come up with a deficit reduction package, incentive auctions are "almost certainly" going to part of it. The supercommittee has until Nov. 23 to come up with its deficit-reduction solutions.
 Shapiro said he supported protecting copyrights, and patents and software, but does not support the PROTECT IP and Stop Online Piracy Acts, which he pointed out are targeted at web sites. While he said that pirate web sites are "horrible and wrong and ought to be stopped," he said he opposes the bills because they give any private party the ability to shut down a web site "without any process protections." But Shapiro went further, saying the legislation was "basically shutting down the Internet in a very large way."
 He also said the bills could be "good" if modified with process protections, though he said that would mean going back to the drawing board. That includes due process, the ability to answer to charges, and a process to make sure the right sites are being targeted. "We don't want the Internet shut down," he said.
 Shapiro suggested that the success of the content community in protecting their copyright, which he says is now almost perpetual, is in part because they are great lobbyists and fund-raisers and give members of the Judiciary Committee a "phenomenal amount" of money. He said that tech companies often vote on the basis of social issues and are not great fund-raisers. "So, all of a sudden you have Republicans and Democrats getting all of this money from the content community, and they [content companies] basically have a very good way with themselves in the Judiciary committee."

When South African David Miller joined the IPL with the Kings XI Punjab franchise, there were high expectations from the swashbuckling batsman.
 The left-hander has had mixed fortunes for KXIP featuring in 79 matches amassing 1850 runs at an average of 34.26 and a strike-rate of 138.78, though it was a couple of poor seasons that led to them parting ways.
 Miller joining the IPL was a stroke of luck for him as injuries to multiple players in the set-up just before the tournament meant KXIP had to reach out to him.
 Speaking to Zimbabwean commentator Pommie Mbangwa on an Instagram live, Miller recalled the phone call less than two weeks before the start of the IPL in 2011. His debut unfortunately would come only a year later.
 “The first year, I went into the auction and I did not get picked up, literally 10 days before the IPL, I got a call from Kings XI Punjab and they said we are selecting you and you need to come over as soon as possible, there was an injury to Stuart Broad so I packed my bags and I went to India.
 “That’s where it all started, it was an incredible journey, firstly it was a just a one year deal, but then they retained me for the next two years at my base price. The first three years of mine at IPL were incredible,” Miller said.
 It was like a dream come true for Miller to get a chance to share a dressing room with Gilchrist having grown up watching him play.
 “Adam Gilchrist was the captain at that time, growing up I always looked up to him and Matthew Hayden, I watched Australia play at 3 am in the morning, Gilchrist was captaining me, we had a lot of greats in our side, so it was a dream for me.
 “In my first year, I did not get a single game at the IPL halfway through my second year, I got three games and then in my third year, Adam Gilchrist was retiring, he actually pulled his both hamstrings, I then got a game and that’s when I played my 101 run knock against RCB,” the 30-year-old further said.

Cricket West Indies chief executive Johnny Grave has said they are in the 'final stages' of discussions with the ECB over the tour of England in July.
 Grave said he's confident the tour will happen 'at some point' and hoped the team would leave West Indies in early June so that they can complete their quarantine protocol before beginning the series in a biosecure environment.
 "From where we sit at the moment, based on the information we have, based on the fact that every day there are less and less cases in the UK everyone is getting increasingly confident that the tour will happen at some point," he told ESPNcricinfo. "Our board meeting is on May 28. If the tour has to take place, by the start of June we would need to have the board approval and support by then in order to get the charter flight logistics in place and select the players.
 "We are in the final stages of discussions with the ECB and they are in the final stages of finalising their plans in order to get the UK government and ECB board support. We are expecting to get a formal offer to tour England probably by the end of the month so that we can get our board's approval and the players can potentially leave the region in early June."
 Grave said the two boards are working on playing three Tests, each starting July 8, July 16 and July 24 respectively. While the venues haven't been finalised, Grave said the 25-member squad would leave for England in the week starting June 8.
 "The ECB have got more confident that they've got a robust and safe plan to deal with cricket in a biosecure environment behind closed doors. Our medical team are getting more confident and comfortable with those plans.
 "Our players and support staff who we have met with are beginning to understand what a seven-week tour behind closed doors might look like. And the operations team are getting the logistics together for flying everyone from across the Caribbean to probably Antigua to then depart to the UK on a private team charter. So yes, good progress is being made and we are getting closer to that final plan for our board to effectively sign off on the tour and ask the selectors to choose the squad and the players to confirm their participation."
 Recently, West Indies Test captain Jason Holder said he wouldn't force anyone to tour England if they have fears. Grave conceded players and support staff have apprehensions, but stressed none have opted out of selection.
 "There is player and support staff apprehension. There is apprehension about leaving their families for seven weeks. There is apprehension about moving into a biosecure cricket ground for the first time. There is apprehension about travelling on planes and going to the UK, which has had so many cases," he said.
 "Also some apprehension around getting back to the Caribbean around what the quarantine requirements may be in their home countries. It is such a dynamic situation, but we hope that if they were tested prior to their departure of the UK and if they need be tested again when they come back to the Caribbean that by late July, they wouldn't have to do any quarantine back here. But clearly, each Caribbean country may have different rules and restrictions so we can't be certain at this stage. So there is some fear and apprehension, not just about leaving the Caribbean to go on the tour but also getting back home to be reunited with their loved ones.
 "Players have concerns, but certainly I have had no feedback that a player has said, based on what we know now and what we have shared, that they won't tour. No-one has directly come out and said they won't tour, but we haven't formally asked them yet."

Researchers at the Technion University in Haifa, Israel developed a "self- disinfecting" face mask for people wear amid the coronavirus pandemic, the academic institution announced Monday.
 In light of the Technion's Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering recent development, the university applied for a patent on March 31 in the United States - the country hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak. As of press time, the United States has reported 1.68 million cases of the coronavirus, and registered 98,024 deaths as a direct result of the viral spread.
 The disinfection process itself, takes place when a layer of carbon fibers in the mask are warmed up by plugging it into a low current source -  the Technion uses a mobile phone charger as an example.


    In recent weeks, the coronavirus pandemic has forced the hands of governments across the globe to require their national constituency to wear face masks when venturing out of the house, as the coronavirus and shelter-in-place orders continue to grip countries worldwide.
 With regard to the masks themselves, there are loads of option available for the public to purchase and use throughout the pandemic. The most popular being the N95 masks, which are essential for front-line medical workers, but are single use and in short supply - this is where the Technion comes in.
 The Technion's innovative reusable face mask, developed by Dean of the Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering Prof. Yair Ein-Eli and his research group, seamlessly destroys viruses that build up on the mask using low current heat. Viruses that would otherwise compromise the efficacy of the face mask.
 When the low current heat (2 amps) is applied to the Technion's mask, the layer of carbon fiber coating the face covering destroys the viruses - accomplished by simply by plugging the mask into an outlet, which sets about the disinfection process.
 "These regulations, along with the urgent need to provide masks for the medical staff caring for coronavirus patients, has led to a surge in demand for these masks and a search for manufacturers and suppliers," the Technion said in a statement to the press. "In the US, for example, approximately 3.5 billion masks are required in order to protect against an acute epidemic - 100 times more than the number of masks readily available. An immediate shortage of masks also occurred in Israel and was accelerated when the Ministry of Health announced that mask-wearing is mandatory."


    SINCE THE ONSET of the coronavirus outbreak, which is believed to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan, China, and the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, the Technion has been on a bit of a disinfectant technology binge, as of late - creating smart innovative solutions to effectively combat the viral spread.
 Last week, researchers from Technion's Wolfson Faculty of Chemical Engineering developed what they call "smart disinfectants," specially formulated to destroy the coronavirus infection that remain chemically active over an extended period of time, the university said in a press statement last week.
 The research team, headed by Asst. Prof. Shady Farah, was awarded a European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) Health COVID-19 Rapid Response grant in order to accelerate the disinfectants into market in the shortest span of time.
 "We are currently producing potential substances and testing them. We plan to select the optimal substance and begin mass production in the next few months," Farah said.
 Considering to date there are no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, effective disinfectants are deemed crucial for stymieing the spread of the coronavirus.
 Farah's research team specializes in creating innovative polymers for medical use and smart drug delivery technologies. During the onset of the pandemic, Farah and his team devoted themselves to developing special anti-viral polymers that act on the viral compound - by altering and damaging its structure as well as attacking and destroying the viral envelope.
 "Disinfectants have been used since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in order to prevent infection from contaminated surfaces - mainly by applying hypochlorite solutions, more commonly known as household bleach. This method has several significant disadvantages: it evaporates quickly, and breaks down rapidly when exposed to sun/UV light. Consequently, its effectiveness is limited and short-term, requiring surfaces to be disinfected several times a day," Technion University said in a press statement.
 Farah added, "although this development was accelerated due to the current coronavirus crisis, in the future it will also be effective against other microorganisms."
