CHINA DENIES DELAY IN INFORMING WHO: A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson says a report from The Associated Press that Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the novel coronavirus is “seriously inconsistent with the facts.” Zhao Lijian told reporters at daily briefing on Wednesday that China’s anti-epidemic efforts are “open to the world, in which the time and the merits and demerits are clear-cut, and the facts and data are in plain sight. It can stand the test of time and history.” Zhao repeated China’s claims to have maintained close communication and cooperation with the World Health Organization and to have acted in an “open, transparent and responsible manner.” Officials kept the information to themselves for more a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines, the AP has found from internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews. Strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame.

Look on the 95% we think when things settle down here in this country, it could get back to normal pretty fast. This has been -- it's been a challenging time for retailers. Last year, we had to work our way through the tariffs, the year before we had to work our way through the border tax that was being proposed. We thought we had blue skies ahead of us back in -- back in March and all of sudden COVID came on so strong. And then last week, we thought we have blue skies again and unfortunately what the country is going through right now, hopefully everybody will pull together and things will get back to normal or whatever the new normal is and -- and I think that look, people are this has been a tough -- it has been tough couple of months for the country, I mean as Americans we are not used to be in quarantine, we are not used to being curfew and Americans like to roam, they like to be free and hopefully everybody will get that feeling back and the country will overcome -- and the country will come together and do the right thing.

As we come up with our models for the second half, there are a wide variety of scenarios, right, and until you see evidence in terms of things happening within our locales and within businesses coming online, those models are again, which one do you want us to choose, right.

I was just going to add one thing to that. I think, and one of the things that's important to understand is, across industries and company size, the disruption caused by COVID has caused almost every company to take a step back and the uncertainty they see in the market and really be thoughtful about how they spend, because nobody knows with certainty what the recovery curve looks like. And so, I would say that we saw companies across the board delaying decisions and taking longer in contemplation and one of the advantages of our business model is we have a relatively short for a lot of our transactions sales cycle. But when companies start to slow down that shows up a little bit more quickly in the numbers. And I think that's what we're seeing this quarter. But the pipeline build, the trial build, all of those things give us a ton of confidence that as certainty emerges in the recovery path, we expect to see a lot of those, those -- that hesitation to unlock and we expect the trends to improve.

You know in some ways, it reminds me of in 2012 when we built our omnichannel distribution center, we couldn't find another example of a fashion retailer that used a single pool of inventory on the scale that we were talking about to service their customers. This is the same kind of thing that we feel like there is an opportunity to set our company up like a digitally native brand would, to be able to put inventory close to customers, manage delivery costs, and improve service levels. So we're excited about it. We had planned to do this over few years. The pandemic and the crisis we're going through actually forced us to move much faster, but at the end of the day that's a good thing. It's going to drive more capacity, more capabilities, better service and ultimately lower cost for us. That's it.

Thanks Michael. Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here and I look forward to meeting all of you soon. My first six weeks as CFO have been active to say the least. COVID-19 pandemic forced us to pivot our 2020 plans from investing for growth to prioritizing liquidity above all else. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow have allowed us to self-fund our business for many years. However, given uncertain operating environment, we accessed debt markets in April to shore up our cash position and enable us to continue to invest for the future. We have been laser focused on near-term cost savings and cash preservation while also working on profit improvement initiatives, including inventory optimization and a review of our store fleet. I'm really proud of what my team has accomplished in such a short period of time. I have long believe the talent, hard work and dedication of our people, the competitive advantage, and this challenging situation has validated that view.

Sure. I want Mike to add-on to this, but I will tell you our merch margin was up to last year, our markdown rates were lower than last year and it was a healthy margin last year. So very strong. The team pulled back on promotions, we got really creative because of the demand we saw online, we were able to pull back on strategic merchant categories and make sure that we were being as profitable as possible. So we continue to be accretive to the total company and you'll see more down the road, we're going to share more insight to Aerie as we built this brand out. And now with Mike joining us, he's very excited to get these results out. So, Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add on.

Let’s have a hearty Cape Meares welcome for Wendy Burroughs and her husband, Mike Olson! Wendy and Mike traveled up and down the Pacific Northwest coastline, from Canada to Oregon, looking for the perfect retirement haven…and they found it right here in Cape Meares.
 Hailing most recently from Tucson, Arizona, Wendy and Mike are excited to be in their new home on Bayocean Road. Mike is a professional musician/recorder/producer and has his own band, “The Key Ingredients of African Soul.” He brings in musicians from around the world, digitally, to create original compositions styled from African traditional music. Mike is converting one of the rooms in their new house to be his studio. Mike also hopes to resurrect his old love of surfing; he already has a couple of surfboards on hand and plans to paddle around Cape Meares Lake for a bit before trying his luck with ocean waves.
 Wendy is retiring from a job with Pima County, Arizona, as an environmental education information officer. She is a nature enthusiast, observing plants, animals and birds. She is thrilled with both the local elk herd that occasionally shows up in their front yard as well as the variety of birds here; Wendy notes that Cape Meares shows up on bird-watching sites as a highly-rated area. She and Mike also like hiking and are looking forward to walking on the beach and in the forest. We wish you the retirement of your dreams here in Cape Meares, Wendy and Mike!
 I talked to a surfer who was contemplating the ocean the other day. I asked him what he looked for when evaluating wave action. He said four things: stability, symmetry, a hollow, and few people. That day was perfect; it was only 9 a.m., but he had already spent four hours surfing. Of course, wetsuits are a must here; the water is not warm, as it is for surfers in California and Hawaii. Surfing is a beautiful sport that requires a lot of stamina.

Hi Gerard, it's Mike, I can take that. The DC cost or the cost from our 3PLs, I'm not expecting as those get up and running and ramped up at the transaction level cost will be that substantially different than our own DCs and that is in our buying, occupancy and warehousing costs, not in SG&A. So just making sure you have it in the right bucket there. As far as stores reopening, obviously our SG&A dollars being down in first quarter had a lots to do with stores being closed and the furlough of our associates. We're really excited to get all those foots back to work here in the second quarter, but as we said, only about half our stores are reopened as of today. So from a cost perspective, we're still going to be a benefit in the second quarter as that continues, that ramp up continues between this month and to July. In general, right now, we also in the second quarter as we kind of pivoted on cash preservation mode, and looked at our controllable discretionary expenses for the balance of the year. The second quarter is where we will see some of those other benefits, some of those costs that are even outside of stores.
