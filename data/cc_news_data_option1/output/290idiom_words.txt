If the goal of this massive fee, along with those thousands of signatures, was to keep lesser-known candidates out, as some observers have mused, then it failed.
 But so what? That's not necessarily a bad thing.
 There will be several heavy-hitter names on the list and it is likely that one of them will be the eventual winner. Peter MacKay has already declared he's in. Pierre Poilievre and Erin O'Toole are expected to announce soon.
 The Conservatives will want to emerge in fighting form out of this leadership race as soon as possible.
 As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is governing with a diminished minority government, there could technically be an election at any time. The Conservatives need to select someone job ready who has a proven track record. It also needs to be someone who won't embarrass the party.
 The grassroots know this and it is almost guaranteed that they'll select one of the high profile candidates.
 This doesn't mean that there's something wrong with a lesser-known candidate stepping forward though, so long as they are genuine in attempting to mount a credible campaign.
 If Canadians are going to have faith in their political system and believe that it answers to them, they need to feel that it is not a closed shop and that it's accessible to all. Good luck to all.
