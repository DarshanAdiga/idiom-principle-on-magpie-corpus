  Andrea Phelan is a lifelong resident of Winchester and a 1983 graduate of Winchester High School. She lives in Winchester with her son Michael and her husband Lieutenant Phelan of the Winchester Fire Department. As a student alumna, faculty alumna and alumni parent, Andrea represents all members of the recently launched Winchester Alumni Association, where she serves on the board of directors.


  We want to cover what matters to our readers. If there is something else you think we should be reporting on, or someone else we should talk to, please let us know here.


  What are you up to now? Tell us a little about your journey.


  Currently I am the proud principal of the Ambrose Elementary School in Winchester. I was previously the assistant principal at Lynch Elementary School and taught both second and third grade at the Muraco Elementary School. From the time I was in the first grade at the Muraco School, I knew I wanted to be a teacher. I had a teacher by the name of Mrs. McFall. I don't remember all of the academics she taught, but I remember how welcoming and kind she was. What I didn't always know was how much I could enjoy being a leader in schools.


  Along with being a passionate educator, I wholeheartedly believe that we all should be committed to our community. My profession takes up a lot of my time, but in years passed I have been a member of the Winton Club, Enka Society and the Rotary Club of Winchester. This year I became a founding member of the board directors for the recently launched Winchester Alumni Association.


  Has there been a recent endeavor/passion that you are proud to have accomplished or pursued?


  In 2008 I was bestowed with the Winchester Foundation for Educational Excellence Sarah Swiger Award. This award is given annually to an educator who embodies a commitment to all students, an understanding of the needs of the whole child, and devotion to community service. Receiving that award was a moment I will never forget and a humbling honor.


  Was there a moment, person or experience at WHS that you remember or that has helped you to find your passions or reach your goals?


  When I went to Winchester High School all of the staff made an effort to build relationships with students. I vividly remember my guidance counselor Ms. Trickett encouraging me to go to school to be a teacher.


  After WHS there were others, who mentored me and helped me grow as an educator and an educational leader, especially past Superintendent Dr. Marini. Jim saw leadership qualities within me, and was influential in my pursuing a masters degree through ELI and Endicott. Rosalie Tashjin, the past principal at Muraco supported my lifelong love of learning, and I carry her words of wisdom about the importance of community building into every day now as principal at Ambrose. Past Lynch Principal John Dupuis was especially instrumental in drawing me out of the classroom and encouraging me to reframe the role I could play in advancing Winchester Public Schools.


  What connection, if any, do you still have to WHS or Winchester schools?


  I have been organizing our class reunions since I graduated. Our 1983 class was a very close group, and many of us get together often. I attend as many WHS events as I can. I love seeing all of my former students, colleagues, classmates. I enjoy learning about and celebrating who they have become. We missed our 35th reunion, but plans are coming to gather in 2020.


  Is there insight or advice you can share with current students? A wish that you have for them?


  Never miss an opportunity to be fabulous. Find what you like to do in life, be kind to everyone and the rest will fall into place. It's all about nurturing relationships and having a growth mindset. Don't define your success by what others are doing or what makes them happy. As Mark Twain said, "comparison is the death of joy." Is there something that you really want to accomplish? Go for it! It may take a long time, but you'll get there.


  Anything else you'd like to add?


  My father graduated from Winchester High in 1941, my brother in 1971, my sister in 1976. Most students know my sister as Mrs. Pace, teacher at Winchester High School. My daughter Noelle, class of 2011, is working as an attorney for WHS class of 1981 alumna Judith Perritano, at Pierce, David, & Perritano in Boston. Our oldest son, Michael lives with us full time and our youngest, Anthony WHS 2017, will graduate in 2021 from Providence College where he is studying Finance and Accounting. All of us believe WHS prepared us for successful lives, however our pathways there differed. We are a proud Sachems Family!


  Each month, Sachem Alumni are spotlighted for their pathways to success. Andrea is only one of the more than 1800 alumni currently registered with the WHS Alumni Association. To catch up on classmates and colleagues, Register today at WinchesterAlumni.org. Do you know of a classmate or other alumnus who has found success in their personal or professional endeavors?

Extending a helping hand to the hapless victims of the raging bushfires in Australia, an Indian couple is providing fresh meals from their restaurant to those affected by the disaster. Kamaljeet Kaur, along with her husband Kanwaljeet Singh, has been preparing simple meals of curry and rice for the victims in their Desi Grill restaurant in Bairnsdale in the state Victoria for the last five days as the bushfire crisis in the country worsened.We are providing proper meals of curry and rice. We distribute the food at the relief centres as well as give to those who come to our restaurant asking for it, Kaur told PTI over phone on Saturday. The situation is really bad. Initially there was less fire in the area but later it expanded. People have lost their lives, houses, farms and animals, she said.Victoria is one of the worst affected areas in the disaster. Other areas are New South Wales and South Australia. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Saturday called up 3,000 military reserve troops to combat the raging bushfire crisis which has so far claimed the lives of 23 people with high temperatures and strong winds threatening to worsen the conditions across the country.More than 14,000 hectares have been destroyed in South Australias Flinders Chase National Park, Kangaroo Island. Expressing concern over the situation, Kaur said that people had left their houses and were either shifting to relief camps or moving to Melbourne.The couple, who migrated to Australia over a decade ago, were earlier providing raw materials to Sikh volunteers in the area to prepare food for the affected people but later started preparing it in their restaurant. Even the shortage in staff in their restaurant has not deterred the Melbourne- based couple from helping those in need as they have roped in friends and family to prepare food for the victims as well as manage business hours of the restaurant.Most of the staff members have left due to the disaster. My family and friends are working in the restaurant, said Kaur, who along with her husband, started the restaurant in Bairnsdale in 2016. She said that the loss in the area felt like personal as we have lived here for seven years before moving to Melbourne.This place is like a small countryside area. We know almost everyone here and are emotionally connected with the people. So the loss is more personal, she said. More than anything else, people have lost their memories as mostly old couples stay in the area and they had their farms and animals destroyed in the fire, she said.Evacuation orders were in place across Victorias Alpine region and the navy was ferrying evacuees to relief centres. We have seen wind gusts up to 67 kmh already today, up at Mount Hotham. Its predicted when the change comes through we will see gusts up to 80 kmh. We have a long way to go today. Today is a very challenging day for all of us, Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said.Temperatures are expected to hit 40 degrees at Gippsland and 45 degrees in northeast. Fears of dry lightning storms are expected to cause more fires. About 50 fires continue to burn across Victoria with more than 820,000 hectares destroyed - mostly in the East Gippsland and northeast of the State. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday declared the state of emergency, advising residents to leave immediately.

A new Gallup survey finds that about half of Americans who hold second jobs say they don’t do it out of financial necessity. Why, then, do they put in the extra hours? Do they just like working?
 Europeans, in stark contrast, relish their free time. Workers in Denmark actually went on a general strike because they were entitled to _only_ five weeks of vacation. They wanted six.
 Many American workers get a lousy one or two weeks off, if that much. Yet 55% of Americans with paid vacation said they didn’t even use all the time off, according to the U.S. Travel Association.
 John de Graaf, who writes on free time and consumption, has a theory on why Americans don’t pound the table for more paid vacation. “Until you actually get a block of time off,” he said, “you don’t really appreciate it.”
 He cites an interesting case in Amador County, California. After the 2007-09 financial crisis, California trimmed its contribution to every county by 10%. County officials in Amador decided that rather than lay off public workers, they would cut their working hours by 10%.
 The Service Employees International Union cried foul. It preferred layoffs of low-seniority people over a shorter workweek for other public employees. The county stood firm but said that it would honor the union’s preference in two years if money remained tight.
 Two years later, the budget still needed cutting. The union leadership predictably chose layoffs and restoring the five-day week for the others. But the workers said, “Wait a minute.” They weren’t asked. The union put the matter before the rank and file, which voted 71% to 29% to stay on four days with less pay.
 What happened? As de Graaf observed, “Workers were now saying things like, ‘Now I go fishing on Fridays.’” (Only a few, mainly men, used the freed-up day to take on outside work.)
 The female employees tended to like the four-day week more than the men, according to de Graaf. They would tell him, “Well, now what I do is the kids are in school on Fridays, so I do various chores on Friday, and then I have the whole weekend off.”
 Amador County workers enjoyed the added advantage of all having the same day off, so they had friends to go fishing with. That’s the thinking in Europe, where nearly everyone gets vacation time during the same weeks of August. Europeans realized that people want time off when friends and family do.
 During the Great Depression, a number of big American companies moved to 30-hour weeks. One of them, Kellogg’s in Battle Creek, Michigan, adopted a kind of compromise. The workweek was reduced to 30 hours, but the company paid the employees for 35 hours. Interestingly, Kellogg’s found that these workers had become more productive during the hours worked.
 Those holding multiple jobs — now about a quarter of U.S. workers — are far rarer in Canada and France, according to Gallup. Why would that be?
 Perhaps the stronger social safety nets in those countries make ordinary people feel more economically secure. Perhaps a consumer culture flashing luxury in our faces makes Americans see some expenditures not as extravagances but as basic necessities. Work is how they can afford them.
 “Other things being equal,” de Graaf adds, “when Americans are given the choice of time or money, most will choose the money.”
 But looking at the experience in Amador County, it’s possible that we just don’t understand the value of time off because we’ve had so little experience with it. If so, what a sad commentary on the American way of life.

Tom Kamenick, an attorney and president and founder of the Wisconsin Transparency Project, said it's not that cut and dried.

"It sounds like they're going over important information and hashing out details outside of the public eye so they don't have to have those discussions during the public board meetings."
 Until 2014, liberal members of the officially nonpartisan County Board had for years had private caucus meetings.

Turkey on Saturday said two foreigners were involved in businessman Carlos Ghosns transit through Istanbul as he fled Japan on his way to Lebanon. There are two foreigners involved in the transit, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul told CNNs Turk broadcaster during an interview.He did not provide further details on their nationality or exactly what role they played. Ghosn, the former Nissan boss, is accused of financial misconduct but he claimed his upcoming trial was rigged before he made his escape from Japan before New Years eve.There is already an official Turkish probe into Ghosns apparent transfer between private jets at Istanbuls Ataturk Airport. The investigation is focused on two flights, the first a Bombardier labeled TC-TSR flew from Osaka in Japan, landed in Istanbul at 05.15 am and parked in a hangar.The second was a private jet to Beirut, a Bombardier Challenger 300 TC- RZA, which left 45 minutes later, news agency DHA previously reported. After seven people were detained earlier this week in Turkey including four pilots, five were formally arrested, Gul said, adding that the prosecutors probe continued.The minister also said that there had been no formal judicial request from the Japanese authorities in relation to the incident.

The hunt for a working-class consciousness has long been frustrated by the inclinations of the working class itself. Socialist author Upton Sinclair, when he launched a bid for governor of California nearly a century ago, lamented the phenomenon. “There was very little working class mentality,” he observed. “Those who belonged to that class did not know it, and hated you for telling them.” At the same time, the middle class has always been up for grabs. “I saw the middle classes suffering just as much as manual workers and farmers,” he continued. “If Fascism came to California it would be through these middle class people. If Democracy were preserved in California, it would be because these people had come to understand the depression and the remedy.”

It is with overwhelming sadness that we announce Ken's passing on Tuesday, December 31, 2019 at the age of 68. Beloved husband to Allison and dedicated and cherished dad to Matthew and Meaghan. Ken is predeceased by his parents, Fred and Shirley. He will be missed by his step-mother Lois, sister Debbie (Brent) Handley, nephew Kyle (Lindsay) Handley and niece Ashley (Troy) Seguin. He will also be lovingly remembered by his aunt Joy (John) Holly as well as extended family and dear friends. Ken was a fiercely committed, respected and proud teacher with the Waterloo Region District School Board for 28 years and often ran into students who remembered him fondly. Over the course of his career, Ken had a positive impact on many young lives, including those he coached in basketball, ball hockey and ice hockey. Ken was an avid sports and Leafs fan whose knowledge of players, statistics and Leafs lore was vast and shared with anyone who would lend an ear. Ken took immense pride and pleasure in his family, his cottage in Sauble Beach and his treasured dogs, Casey, Samson and Charlie. Ken met each day bravely and kept a positive attitude. He was grateful for the excellent care he received. Thanks to Dr. Fortino and staff, Dr. Hubay and the Grand River Cancer Centre team, Vicki at the Diabetes Clinic, Dr. Tan, Dr. Trussler and the LHIN unit, and the amazing nurses of 5D North at Grand River Hospital. Friends and family are invited to gather and celebrate Ken's life at Westmount Memorial Celebration Centre on Friday, January 10, 2020 from 1-3 p.m. with family tributes held at 2:30 p.m. Cremation has taken place and a private interment will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations may be directed to the KW Humane Society or Grand River Hospital. Ken is forever in our hearts. "Go Leafs Go!!!"

“We really wanted to have a full picture of what went on before we go into the preliminary exam,” Attwood said, adding that investigation reports are still being finalized.
 Supal was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 12 and arraigned the next day before Judge Robert Cooney. Cooney denied Supal bond, remanding him to a cell in Grand Traverse County’s jail.
 A passerby discovered Wanda Mae Lyons’ body on Dec. 11 after spotting drag marks along Kasson Center Road in Leelanau County, Sheriff Mike Borkovich previously told the Record-Eagle.
 Supal and his father own property along Kasson Center, court records show.
 Curious, the man followed the tracks through a wooded stretch up to the edge of a steep ravine.
 Lyons’ nude body, wrapped in black plastic and covered in leaves, rested at the bottom. She’d been bludgeoned, stabbed and strangled, according to a pathologist’s report, and suffered neck fractures.
 Lyons’ husband reported her missing hours after the discovery, Traverse City Police Department investigators previously said.
 He’d stepped out after an evening spat, and upon returning the next day found his wife gone and their extended-stay room at Traverse City’s Terrace Beach Motel bloodied.
 Supal stayed on and off in a nearby room, Grand Traverse County Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg previously told the Record-Eagle, and the three were the motel’s only residents. Lyons, previously from Chicago, and her husband had been staying at Terrace Beach for 2 to 3 months, and knew Supal in passing.
 Investigators quickly connected the dots and agencies joined forces in the investigation, probing the nearby waters of the West Grand Traverse Bay and cataloging several pieces of evidence from Terrace Beach.

Tehran has already vowed to retaliate, and in the short term, the Iranian general’s death raises the risk for U.S. troops, government workers and even civilians in Iraq and other parts of the region.

How do I increase my weight?


  For a number of reasons, you should see your doctor first before deciding to lose weight.


  "Dealing with any underlying cause such as thyroid disease, tackling stress or getting support with severe grief or eating disorders is the first place to start," says Dr Sally. "But then you need to think about how to gain back your weight in a healthy way. And simply filling up with calories from high-sugar, high-fat processed food isn't the way to go. Yes, you may put on weight - but it will be mainly fat that won't improve your health much, if at all."


  So while the odd pizza and chocolate indulgence is fine, it's important to also make sure you're eating healthily - even when trying to gain weight.

But they were virtues within the capacity of everyone; they did not assume any special breeding, or status, or talent, or valor, or grace -- or even money.

Following is a summary of current US domestic news briefs. Judges struggle over Trump bid to block McGahn congressional testimonyU.S. appeals court judges on Friday appeared skeptical about broad legal arguments by President Donald Trumps administration seeking to block a former White House lawyer from testifying to Congress as part of the impeachment effort against Trump, but also seemed wary about stepping into the heated political fight. Judge Thomas Griffith asked tough questions of the Justice Department lawyer who argued on the administrations behalf and the lawyer for the Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee that subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn, and could be the pivotal vote in deciding the case. Hanukkah machete suspect indicted in New York on six counts of attempted murderThe man accused of going on a machete rampage at the New York-area home of a Hasidic rabbi during a Hanukkah celebration was indicted on Friday on six counts of attempted murder, up from five counts the suspect was charged with previously. The indictment also charges Grafton Thomas, 37, with three counts of assault, three counts of attempted assault and two counts of burglary stemming from the Dec. 28 attack, Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Walsh announced at a brief news conference. U.S. Senator Booker raised 6.6 million for presidential bidU.S. Senator Cory Booker raised 6.6 million in the last three months of 2019 for his bid to win the Democratic nomination for president, a haul nearly identical to the prior quarters total, his campaign announced on Friday. Booker has struggled in public opinion polls and did not qualify to participate in the December debate. Conservative, liberal Methodists to split over gay marriageThe United Methodist Church plans to split into two later this year, church officials said on Friday, a schism that follows years of contention over whether the church should end its ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy. The plan, if approved at the churchs worldwide conference in Minneapolis in May, would divide the third-largest U.S. Christian denomination into two branches A traditionalist side opposed to gay marriage and the ordination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender clergy, and a progressive wing that will allow same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy. U.S. Democratic contenders condemn Iran strike, warn of warDemocratic presidential contenders on Friday condemned the air strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, saying President Donald Trumps decision was reckless and could lead the United States to another war in the Middle East. President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox, said former Vice President Joe Biden. His campaign released a 30-second online ad that portrayed Biden as tested and trusted around the world against Trumps erratic, unstable presidency. Rumbling Alaska volcano sends ash plume 5 miles into the airOne of Alaskas most active volcanoes, a towering ice-covered cone in the Aleutian Islands, shot a cloud of ash more than 5 miles high on Friday, triggering a warning to aviators and putting on a show that was captured in satellite imagery. The ash burst from Shishaldin Volcano, about 670 miles southwest of Anchorage, was part of an on-and-off, mostly low-level series of eruptions that began in July with a stream of lava from the crater at the peak of the 9,373-foot-tall mountain. U.S. Senate in stalemate over how to proceed with Trump impeachment trialThe U.S. Senate remained at a stalemate on Friday over how to proceed with the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, as the chambers leaders wrangled over whether White House aides will be called as witnesses and the top Democrat appealed to a handful of Republicans who could help break the impasse. After a two-week holiday recess, there was still no clarity about when Trumps impeachment trial might begin.

In a filing on Friday, lawyers for Avenatti said it would be so prejudicial to Mr. Avenatti as to deprive him of a fair trial for prosecutors to suggest he was more than 15 million in debt, a claim Avenatti vehemently disputes, when he allegedly tried to extort up to 25 million from Nike. Trump tells evangelical rally he will put prayer in schoolsU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said his Democratic opponents would tear down crosses and pledged to bring prayer to public schools at a re-election rally to shore up evangelical support.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the security threat to his frequently targeted city changed significantly overnight considering the resources of a modern, major nation such as Iran compared to those of non-state organizations like al Qaeda or ISIS.

Extending a helping hand to the hapless victims of the raging bushfires in Australia, an Indian couple is providing fresh meals from their restaurant to those affected by the disaster. Kamaljeet Kaur, along with her husband Kanwaljeet Singh, has been preparing simple meals of curry and rice for the victims in their Desi Grill restaurant in Bairnsdale in the state Victoria for the last five days as the bushfire crisis in the country worsened.


  "We are providing proper meals of curry and rice. We distribute the food at the relief centres as well as give to those who come to our restaurant asking for it," Kaur told PTI over phone on Saturday. "The situation is really bad. Initially there was less fire in the area but later it expanded. People have lost their lives, houses, farms and animals," she said.


  Victoria is one of the worst affected areas in the disaster. Other areas are New South Wales and South Australia. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Saturday called up 3,000 military reserve troops to combat the raging bushfire crisis which has so far claimed the lives of 23 people with high temperatures and strong winds threatening to worsen the conditions across the country.


  More than 14,000 hectares have been destroyed in South Australia's Flinders Chase National Park, Kangaroo Island. Expressing concern over the situation, Kaur said that people had left their houses and were either shifting to relief camps or moving to Melbourne.


  The couple, who migrated to Australia over a decade ago, were earlier providing raw materials to Sikh volunteers in the area to prepare food for the affected people but later started preparing it in their restaurant. Even the shortage in staff in their restaurant has not deterred the Melbourne-based couple from helping those in need as they have roped in friends and family to prepare food for the victims as well as manage business hours of the restaurant.


  "Most of the staff members have left due to the disaster. My family and friends are working in the restaurant," said Kaur, who along with her husband, started the restaurant in Bairnsdale in 2016. She said that the loss in the area felt like "personal as we have lived here for seven years before moving to Melbourne."


  "This place is like a small countryside area. We know almost everyone here and are emotionally connected with the people. So the loss is more personal," she said. "More than anything else, people have lost their memories as mostly old couples stay in the area and they had their farms and animals destroyed in the fire," she said.


  Evacuation orders were in place across Victoria's Alpine region and the navy was ferrying evacuees to relief centres. "We have seen wind gusts up to 67 km/h already today, up at Mount Hotham. It's predicted when the change comes through we will see gusts up to 80 km/h. We have a long way to go today. Today is a very challenging day for all of us," Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said.


  Temperatures are expected to hit 40 degrees at Gippsland and 45 degrees in northeast. Fears of dry lightning storms are expected to cause more fires. About 50 fires continue to burn across Victoria with more than 820,000 hectares destroyed - mostly in the East Gippsland and northeast of the State. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday declared the state of emergency, advising residents to leave immediately.

The screenplay flips constantly from subtle and insightful to preachy and ham-handed. Characters are also written unevenly, including the fictitious one played by Robbie, who is presented first as a somewhat sheltered Christian millennial with a strong right-wing pedigree before the film lands her in bed with a lesbian co-worker (Kate McKinnon) immediately after their meeting. The paradox is that the movie actually tries to be fair and balanced. But like the network it covers, that effort is thwarted constantly by the ideological blinders of its creators.

But there’s evidence that representing those wealthy districts may be a leading indicator of where the party is headed. New research by economist Thomas Piketty — the basis of his new book “Capital and Ideology,” a sequel to his 2013 blockbuster “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” — shows that educated voters blaze a trail the wealthy later follow. In 1960, the Democratic Party’s main backers had both lower incomes and less education than Republicans. Beginning in ’64, a great divergence began: Educated voters flocked to the Democratic Party, even as the top 10 percent of income earners remained Republican. Along the way, Republicans — still the party of the rich — deftly caricatured Democrats as out-of-touch elites, liberal arts professors disconnected from beer-swilling real Americans.

Following is a summary of current US domestic news briefs. Judges struggle over Trump bid to block McGahn congressional testimony
 U.S. appeals court judges on Friday appeared skeptical about broad legal arguments by President Donald Trump's administration seeking to block a former White House lawyer from testifying to Congress as part of the impeachment effort against Trump, but also seemed wary about stepping into the heated political fight. Judge Thomas Griffith asked tough questions of the Justice Department lawyer who argued on the administration's behalf and the lawyer for the Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee that subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn, and could be the pivotal vote in deciding the case. Hanukkah machete suspect indicted in New York on six counts of attempted murder
 The man accused of going on a machete rampage at the New York-area home of a Hasidic rabbi during a Hanukkah celebration was indicted on Friday on six counts of attempted murder, up from five counts the suspect was charged with previously. The indictment also charges Grafton Thomas, 37, with three counts of assault, three counts of attempted assault and two counts of burglary stemming from the Dec. 28 attack, Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Walsh announced at a brief news conference. U.S. Senator Booker raised $6.6 million for presidential bid
 U.S. Senator Cory Booker raised $6.6 million in the last three months of 2019 for his bid to win the Democratic nomination for president, a haul nearly identical to the prior quarter's total, his campaign announced on Friday. Booker has struggled in public opinion polls and did not qualify to participate in the December debate. Conservative, liberal Methodists to split over gay marriage
 The United Methodist Church plans to split into two later this year, church officials said on Friday, a schism that follows years of contention over whether the church should end its ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy. The plan, if approved at the church's worldwide conference in Minneapolis in May, would divide the third-largest U.S. Christian denomination into two branches: A traditionalist side opposed to gay marriage and the ordination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender clergy, and a progressive wing that will allow same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy. U.S. Democratic contenders condemn Iran strike, warn of war
 Democratic presidential contenders on Friday condemned the air strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, saying President Donald Trump's decision was reckless and could lead the United States to another war in the Middle East. "President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox," said former Vice President Joe Biden. His campaign released a 30-second online ad that portrayed Biden as "tested and trusted around the world" against Trump's "erratic, unstable" presidency.

The ash burst from Shishaldin Volcano, about 670 miles southwest of Anchorage, was part of an on-and-off, mostly low-level series of eruptions that began in July with a stream of lava from the crater at the peak of the 9,373-foot-tall mountain. U.S. Senate in stalemate over how to proceed with Trump impeachment trial

After a two-week holiday recess, there was still no clarity about when Trump's impeachment trial might begin. Avenatti says evidence he's cash- strapped doesn't belong in Nike extortion trial

All-rounder Irfan Pathan on Saturday announced his retirement from all forms of cricket, ending an injury-ridden career that prevented him from realizing his true potential. The 35-year-olds retirement was on expected lines, considering he last played a competitive game in February 2019 during the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy for Jammu and Kashmir.Before turning up for Jammu and Kashmir as a player cum mentor in 2018, Pathan played all his domestic cricket for Baroda. Though he remains a non-playing mentor to the Jammu and Kashmir outfit, Irfan had not been playing over the past 12 months and did not even put himself in the IPL auction pool last month.The left-arm seamers bowling was like a breath of fresh air when he made his India debut against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in 2003. He was all of 19 back then. He never had express pace but his natural ability to swing the ball into the right- handers got him instant success, also drawing comparisons with the great Kapil Dev.It seemed India had found the all-rounder they were looking for since Kapil left the scene. Pathan, who last played for India in October 2012, featured in 29 Tests 1105 runs and 100 wickets, 120 ODIs 1544 runs and 173 wickets and 24 T20 Internationals 172 runs and 28 wickets.In the 2003-04 Test series in Australia, he bowled a sensational spell of reverse swing in Sydney, getting rid of two key players -- Steve Waugh and Adam Gilchrist. The game, however, ended in a draw. He was also part of the victorious Indian team at the 2007 World Twenty20 and was the man-of-the-match in the final against Pakistan.One of his best performances came on the tour of Pakistan in 2006 when he became the second Indian after Harbhajan Singh to take a Test hat- trick, removing Salman Butt, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yusuf in the first over of the match held in Karachi. In 2008, he played a big role in India winning a Test match against Australia on a tough Perth wicket, which offered steep bounce.Injuries and lack of form troubled him thereafter and his ability to swing the ball deteriorated. His downfall coincided with Greg Chappells stint as the India head coach. Pathan has been commentating on the game over the past 24 months and it would be very much part of his future plans.His India teammates were quick to congratulate him on social media. Wish you great 2nd inn my brother IrfanPathan. What a champion bowler and a fighter on the field... god bless you brother... lots of love, tweeted Harbhajan.Former India batsman VVS Laxman wrote Was such a joy to see IrfanPathan evolve from an aspiring 17yr old cricketer when I first saw him into a mature International Cricketer. You can be very proud of what u have achieved not only as a cricketer but also in mentoring young cricketers from JK. A very happy 2nd innings. With his elder brother Yusuf, he made a rare sibling pair to represent India. PTI NRB BS BS ATAT

What do you think was the biggest national news story of 2019?


  If you are guessing this monumental story starts with a “T,” you are quite right. However, it’s not the T-word you are thinking of.


  The biggest news story of 2019 was about a train — no ordinary train, but the greatest and strongest steam engine ever built — the Union Pacific Big Boy 4014. This gigantic steam engine was built in the early 1940s to haul long heavy trains of coal over the Wasatch Mountains between Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Ogden, Utah. Twenty-five Big Boys were built; eight survived to go display in parks across the country. Until May of 2019, none of them were running.


  Union Pacific Railroad, the original owner of the 4014, worked diligently for the last six years to get this mighty engine up and running. The efforts required a total rebuild of the engine, and in many cases, parts had to be engineered one at a time.


  Union Pacific’s mission was to get the Big Boy on the tracks, in working order, by mid-May, and take it to Ogden, Utah.


  The occasion was the 150th anniversary of “The Golden Spike,” the meeting of trains coming from the east and west, the completion of the Transcontinental Railway in 1869. For the first time, Americans could travel from New York to San Francisco by train. It was a miraculous piece of history, uniting the country and making travel feasible.


  On May 9, 2019, thousands of train fans gathered in Ogden to watch as the Big Boy arrived from its home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The UP 844 also arrived, and the engines met nose to nose, just as history recorded two engines meeting a century and a half ago.


  My husband, Bruce, was one of the throngs of train buffs — affectionately known as steam nerds — who waited patiently for the engines to arrive, decked out with cameras, phones, video cameras and tripods. He and his buddy Scott from Chicago and many others followed the engine back across Utah and Wyoming. The Big Boy spent the rest of the summer and into the fall traversing much of the western half of the U.S.


  To our great good fortune, the Big Boy’s travels took him through Minnesota. He started in Albert Lea, then north through Waseca and Faribault, then into the metro area for a three-day stop at Union Depot in St. Paul. Then, north again and on to Duluth. Hundreds of people greeted the train at each stop.


  I went to see the engine in St. Paul. Bruce and sons Paul and Matt took a few days vacation time and met the engine in Faribault, then went to Duluth to see the engine one more time before it took off east to Chicago and on to other destinations.


  While the Big Boy’s presence in Minnesota was the ultimate experience for train fanatics, its visit also attracted history buffs, families and young toy train lovers. If you did not get the chance to see it traverse our state, let me tell you, this is not Thomas the Tank Engine. It is not cute and cuddly. It is a monster — at 132 feet long, it’s about two-thirds the length of a Boeing 747. At 17.5 feet tall, it dwarfs the tallest humans. The driving wheels alone are 5 feet 8 inches tall. UP says it weighs about 1.2 million pounds.


  And steam engines have lives of their own. They groan and crackle when they start to move. They huff and puff as they start to breathe, then pick up speed as they steam down the tracks. And when the engine is going full bore, the ground shakes and you have to cover your ears because of the thunderous noise.


  Yes, the biggest news event of 2019 was the reincarnation of this monstrous being, sharing with all of us a living and breathing history lesson and showing how tons of iron and steel can be intimidating and beautiful at the same time.


  It’s one “T” word that we all can agree on.
