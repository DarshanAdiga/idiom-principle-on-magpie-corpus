HHRD's self-proclaimed "Sister organization" ICNA is, according to experts, the western branch of Jamaat-e-Islami, a radical South Asian Islamist movement. HHRD has come under fire from members of Congress for sponsoring a conference in Pakistan with multiple branches of the terrorist group Lashkar- e-Taiba and for openly funding groups that themselves openly fund terrorism.

Smith wrote in Jewish News Syndicate (JNS), "Yet Singh may have the last laugh. In a series of recent reports, she documented the activities of several Islamist groups that have serious issues with terror financing, as well as the influence campaign aimed at promoting an Islamist view of Kashmir. Several of these same groups are closely and publicly aligned with Omar". He added, "In her testimony, Singh highlighted US and UN-designated terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbu-ul-Mujahideen and Jaish-e-Mohammad, as well as these groups' wanton murder of Hindus and uncooperative moderate Muslims alike. Yet Omar ignored this, instead focusing solely on overreach by the Indian government. This is the narrative favored by Stand With Kashmir (SWK) and its numerous affiliated Islamist groups. SWK's origins and funding is a mystery, but their officials include former activists from Islamist organizations such as Students for Justice in Palestine".
