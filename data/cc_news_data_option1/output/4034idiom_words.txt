The left-handed Padikkal has so far scored 178 runs for the RCB in this edition of the IPL, including three half-centuries. The 20-year-old has been consistent throughout the tournament and has provided the team with steady starts.   On the other hand, Bishnoi has been able to maintain a stranglehold over the opposition batsmen, and the spinner has taken four wickets for KXIP.   Sanjay Bangar has been impressed by SunRisers Hyderabad pacer T Natarajan and the former India batting coach hailed the execution of yorkers from the pacer.   "The yorker ball is the most difficult ball in this format, and that too when the ball is wet, despite that T Natarajan bowled in the previous match and sorted out SRH's death bowling issue. I am really impressed by Natarajan. He is looking in good form and Natarajan will be my player of choice who has impressed me in the IPL," Bangar said on Star Sports' show 'Cricket Connected'.   Natarajan has played five matches in this year's IPL so far, and has managed to take five wickets at an economy rate of 8.31. (ANI)
