City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal on Friday said history-sheeters were under constant surveillance.
 When journalists asked him about the steps taken by the police to handle anti- social elements, he said the police had always had a category-wise list of history-sheeters, including details of the ones active within and outside the city.
 “We are always watching them and will take immediate action if they commit any offence,” Mr. Aggarwal said.
 The Commissioner added that as per the Madras High Court’s suggestion, a draft legislation on curtailing rowdyism was on the cards. [The DGP had informed the court about the same on Thursday.]
 Mr. Aggarwal, along with Additional Commissioners of Police, flagged off an awareness campaign vehicle on COVID-19 prevention and precautionary measures.
 ## Public cooperation
 He said the State government had been taking all out efforts to prevent the spread of the disease and had been successful in controlling its spread. He added that 100% success could be achieved with the full participation of the public.
 The Commissioner said over 2,500 police personnel had been infected so far. While most of them had been cured and had rejoined duty, around 250 were still hospitalised or under home quarantine. Senior police officers are in touch with them and are regularly enquiring about the treatment given to them.

The agitation against the Farm Bills has set me thinking. I had so far been of the view that for anything to happen and sustain in the Government it had to be politically acceptable, socially desirable, technologically feasible, financially viable, administratively doable and judicially tenable. This in itself was quite a handful. However, the unexpected agitation against the Farm Bills has compelled me to add another dimension: "emotionally relatable".
 Almost everyone outside the Government feels that not much happens in the Government. Not only that, each one of them will have an idea on how to make- things-happen. However, if the seven aforementioned aspects are not taken into consideration, the idea will perhaps not travel much distance on the ground. Let us consider each one of them.
 No matter how good an idea is, it will get converted into policy only if the ultimate decision-making authority, a politician or a group of politicians, puts its stamp on it. For example, many would argue that reservation in government jobs is adversely impacting governance. If there is a referendum, perhaps the majority will vote against it. But can we dispense with it now or at any time in the future?  Perhaps not, because it will never be politically acceptable. That is why decision making in democracies takes much longer than in countries like China. A lot of time gets spent in consensus building. This is not to say that democracies are worse than autocracies because political acceptability, as an underlying principle of democracy, has its own merits.
 The social desirability of an idea is equally important even if it may not appear to be so. It is important in the context of the implementation of an idea that maybe politically acceptable. A number of schemes announced by the Government, hence politically acceptable, fail on the ground because while formulating the scheme, the social context is not taken into consideration. Thus, the infamous Family Planning effort of the Government during the dark days of emergency not only met with failure but led to the fall of the Government. This may be an extreme example but many schemes and ideas face enormous problems if they are not socially desirable. Understanding the needs of the stakeholders is critical for the success of any scheme.
 Technology is changing by the day. Hence, the feasibility of technology becomes an important determinant in the implementation of an idea and sustaining it. Many of those that have not travelled to various parts of the country advocate the use of the internet to reach out to children during COVID times for schooling. They are perhaps unaware of the fact that the internet has not reached out as yet to a large part of the country. The situation may change over a period of time but as of now, it may not be possible to reach out to all the children through the net.
 The most critical part in the implementation of an idea is the availability of funds to back such an idea. Till a couple of years ago, a number of Railway lines were announced by successive Railway Ministers in their speech (fortunately this has ceased now) without the funds to back them. These railway lines were socially desirable and technologically feasible. They were obviously politically acceptable as well. But they never happened on the ground. Similar apprehensions are raised about the recently announced National Education Policy (NEP). The Policy recommends the allocation of 6% of GDP to the Education Sector. This is nothing new. It was recommended long ago by Dr Kothari in his Report as well. But the money never came despite a cess levied by the government to raise resources. In fact, during the period from 2014 to 2018, the budgetary allocation to School Education actually came down in real terms. Without requisite money to back ideas, such ideas will not travel a long distance.
 Even if we have the requisite money, if the desired human resources are not available, the idea will not work on the ground. One of the reasons for failure in the delivery of health care in rural areas is the shortage of doctors. Health care is politically acceptable and socially desirable. There is a reasonable amount of money available. But a shortage of human resource is a major constraint.  School Education in the country is another example where there is an acute shortage of human resources. There is an additional problem relating to their management as well. This management of the teachers who are the pivot of school education has left a lot to be desired. The biggest mafia in School Education is the one that provides pre-service training, the B.Ed and D.El.Ed Colleges. A large number of them exist only on paper but they can give you a degree. The selection of teachers to Government Schools is another racket. One former Chief Minister is behind the bars for manipulating selection. What can be expected of teachers that have come through such a process? Human resource management is the key to the success of any programme.
 Finally, no matter what the government does, the final arbiter is the judiciary. It can undo all that may have been attempted. The over-indulgent judiciary can make matters worse.
 The Farm Bills appear to be fine on all these dimensions mentioned above. Even those that are opposing it on account of political considerations were themselves pushing for such reforms when they were in power. Most of them would privately agree that the Bills would benefit the farmers and will free them from the clutches of "middle-men". However, opposition to the Bills is still so huge. It reflects the inability of the proponents to make this idea "emotionally relatable" to the farming community. The Bills are indeed socially desirable but the government which has otherwise demonstrated to be so skilful in communicating messages has apparently been unable to do so in the present instance. Hence, the Bills that are so beneficial to the farmers are not perceived as such. There is, therefore, this problem of perception and a large number of farmers are not able to relate emotionally with the Bills.
 The listing of these limitations does not mean that things don't happen in the government. The success of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Coal Block auctions and unprecedented increase in coal production during 2014-16, Ayushman Bharat and the like prove that it-can-happen. These programmes/schemes/efforts understood these limitations and worked around them. There is indeed a lot to learn from how they made-it-happen for others to make-it-happen.

ALMA -- J.D. Coursey is sitting with his family. It's Friday somewhere in America, and for the Courseys, that somewhere is Citizens Bank Field at Airedale Stadium.                           Just then, as J.D. and Bekah Thomas-Coursey's older son lay on the field, his crumpled-up body leaning closer to the opposing team's sideline than his own, Jacob is wincing after a hard hit during the opening week of Alma's 2020 football season.                           Nothing is promised in COVID-19 2020. Not even high school football. An injured football player in September?                           Get in line.                           Six months before, as schools are shutting down amid a pandemic people were still trying to understand, Jacob Coursey is shooting baskets on a sun-splashed April afternoon in a church parking lot with classmates BriLee White, Drew Battles and Hunter McAlister.                           On this night, however, anxious classmates are standing in unison until Coursey picks himself off the turf. The 5-foot-7, 165-pound senior eventually trots off the field, his spirit shaken but not broken.                           A week later, Coursey cradled a perfectly thrown pass from quarterback Conner Stacy on the team's fourth snap of the game, then raced 53 yards for a touchdown reception during Alma's 17-14 overtime win over Rogers Heritage.                           A good route runner with good hands and average speed, Coursey is one of Stacy's favorite targets.                           "It was really a big deal for our team and it was really big for coach (Rusty) Bush to get his first win here," Coursey said. "It brings a lot of chemistry between us and our coaches and us as teammates."                           But it's Coursey's defensive prowess that draws the most raves. Like a heat-seeking missile, there's nothing soft about Jacob Coursey's tackling ability.                           "You have to play angry to be successful," he said. "It's just kind of a mindset you have to have. When you step on the field and put the helmet on, you turn into a different person. During practice, it's not really the same because we're going against our own guys. I kind of have the mindset during the game that those guys (opponents) are trying to take something from me that I want.                           "It's a different mindset that not everybody has."                           Coursey leads the team in tackles and has 10 receptions for 108 yards and a TD reception.                           Alma (1-3, 0-1) travels to Harrison today.                           "He does everything you ask him to do at a hundred miles an hour," Bush said. "You don't have this happen very often in your crew, but sometimes you have to slow them down at practice, just because you don't want to get anybody hurt."                           "Coursey has been our leader in the back (secondary) since I got here," first-year defensive coordinator Ernest Pressley said. "He's that guy who can go out there and get us lined up in multiple coverages. We've asked him a lot this year, to step down in the box and help us on run support. That was really evident those first four games - he was averaging 12 to 15 tackles a game."                           Not only that, but Coursey also led the team in forced fumbles behind the line of scrimmage. "For a safety, that kind of talks about his aggressiveness and how tough he is," Pressley added.                           Old School                           Jacob Thomas Coursey is a throwback football player in every sense, the type of kid who could've played for Wayne Thompson's 1972 Airedales just as easily as some of those tough-as-nails mighty mites who left it all on the field for Frank Vines' 1990s Airedales.                           Jacob came into this world on the morning of April 21, 2003, a 5-pound, 4-ounce bundle of joy born five weeks premature with baby blue eyes and a smile that immediately melted the hearts of his two of his biggest fans -- grandmothers Cindy Coursey and Patricia Thomas.                           "As a dad, all you want is to see your kids go work hard and benefit from the fruit of all their labor. Nobody sees your kids work the way you see your kids work," J.D. Coursey said. "You see them come home after a loss or after a bad practice. As a dad, it's even more rewarding to see all that hard work pay off.                           "He's having to learn to be a good teammate and trust his coaches. I'm thrilled that we're in week five of the football season and he's still playing -- every play is a blessing."                           Green and Gold                           By the time Jacob Coursey was old enough to play football, J.D. Coursey -- now an assistant principal at Alma Middle School -- had become an assistant football coach.                           Seventeen years later, Jacob Coursey is living proof that little guys aren't just happy to be part of the team but important players, too.                           "My dad played here; my dad coached here, and my uncle (Shane) played here, too," Coursey said. "We've all kind of grown up here. Growing up here and watching the guys ahead of me ... they played not just for each other but the name on the jersey.                           "He's a small-town kid who absolutely loves this game and loves his teammates," Bush said. "He's a coach's kid who understands the game. He's a special kid, and I'm really excited to be part of his senior year."                           Tyler's sidekick                           As a ball boy for the Airedales -- a feat Jacob Coursey did between his fourth- and ninth-grade seasons -- during his dad's coaching tenure, Coursey admired the play of former football star Tyler Mlakar.                           One day he told him as much.                           "I was a ball boy from fourth through the ninth grade; me and Tyler had some conversations," Coursey said. "I just really looked up to him. I had his mom, too, when I was in the sixth grade."

Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of -$0.41 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $0.79 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -399.50% and predicted to reach at 11.76% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 23.00% for the next five year.

Everybody is aware that Florida is the hot spot, but they're usually thinking Burmese pythons, things like that, where the much greater number of things coming in are actually snails and insects and plant pathogens."

When the darkness of night rolls around, what makes it so beautiful? There are probably a few things that come to mind. But, all in all, it’s the stars. The shape, the brightness and the constellations that make it worth your while. Only when the time is right.       When winter rolls around in King City, hockey is the town’s brightest star; the most beautiful constellation. It’s what everyone waits for. It’s what every child, wakes up for every morning. If a sport, defined a town, hockey defines King City. Ask a lot of people around – they’ll agree with you.       When the King Weekly Sentinel spoke with King Minor hockey president Ilya Dagenais, he said it frankly. Hockey is King City.       And now, this winter, despite uncertainties surrounding the ominous COVID-19 pandemic, King Minor Hockey is returning, but in a very different way.       Dagenais has been working closely with the Township of King. He says the Trisan Centre is expected to open this week and Nobleton Arena will open in three weeks.       “As it currently stands, King City arena will not open,” Dagenais added.       “As it currently stands with restrictions of 50 per building and some sanitization that needs to be done, every 60-minute ice slot turns into 90-minutes.”       Normally, in any given winter, there would be 55 usable ice hours. But now with one arena short, there’s going to be a drop to roughly 35 hours a week of ice time.       This season will see less ice time for the players than before due to restrictions. This year, unlike any other year, will combine King City, NobleKing and Schomberg’s teams together.       Registration only dropped by 20 per cent versus last year.       Before entering the building, everyone must complete a COVID-19 health checklist. All members must wear a mask while entering the building at all times and for the players, they must wear a mask until the moment they hit the ice.       Change rooms will not be available for use and parents will be permitted to watch their child practice for the time being. There may be changes to this, depending on the situation of the virus.       As for the players and coaches, everyone will be sequestered within their own bubbles. Major and minor league players will be combined in a non-age specific bubble of a maximum of 50.       Players and members of staff may not interact with other members in other bubbles.       “The first two to three weeks, depending on when we get the second pad of ice, it will all be (player) development,” Dagenais said.       “By the third week of October, somewhere around there, we’ll start phasing in the house league play.”       According to the Ontario Minor Hockey Association guidelines, teams will consist of nine skaters and one goalie within the bubble. Children will compete in three-on-three or four-on-four contests once a week. It is noted, teams may be reduced depending if the size of the bubble is less than 50.       Scores, standings and statistics will all be recorded not only for a fun, but also a competitive experience.       While understanding this is designed to be a fun and safe experience, Dagenais also understands financial implications families might be enduring.       As a result of this, he has covered all he can and expects to dig into the reserves.       “We do know from our parents, some have had a rough year with lay-offs and financial situations in the world right now. We didn’t want the financial situation to be an obstacle to be able to get their kids on the ice. We made the commitment unanimously as a board that those reserves are there for a rainy day and you can’t get more of a rainy day than this pandemic.”       King Minor Hockey is paying for the ice, jerseys, socks, timekeeper and referees. It’s a one-stop, shop and there’s no requirement for fundraising.       All costs are available online on their website.       Dagenais says families have indicated their appreciation for this as families look forward to enjoying a winter season of hockey.

Looks, outward appearances, are for other people.       A realization dawned on me the other day, one that may change the way we look at ourselves, or rather, glance outward.       I don’t have a concrete idea of what I look like.       The other day I watched the beginning of a sci-fi movie on Netflix. The main character’s lifeless double is found on the floor. He turns the body over and he’s shocked to find out it’s him.       I thought about this for a minute. If I found a body on the floor, turned it over, I wouldn’t readily recognize myself. I’d turn his head left and right, study it, and then sigh, wondering to myself if that’s really what I look like.       Let me qualify.       I spend maybe 90 seconds looking in the mirror in the morning, and another 90 seconds at night, while brushing my teeth. The rest of the day, I never check myself out.       Our brains are our internal computers – they are everything we are. We perceive, judge, weigh, decide and calculate everything by what we see. Our eyes flip the information to our brains, where the whole process takes place.       We glance downward at our hands, arms, legs and feet. But we can’t look at our faces, unless we stand in front of a mirror, a reversed image of our real selves.       If we never look in a mirror, or lose our eyesight, how do we know what we look like? Is our mental picture of our appearance burned into our brains? Is it slightly different than the real deal?       For some, they have a mountain of photos of themselves, perhaps even videos, where they can see themselves in all their glory. They can watch themselves in action.       I joke to my wife that during my wake, the room will be somewhat void of photos. I don’t have many of myself – I don’t like them. Sure, there may be half a dozen family shots but very few depictions of this outstanding man exist.       You will notice that I have a graphic, a cartoon, of myself at the top of this column. I did have photos in my younger days at the Caledon Citizen, but tossed that idea as I aged, not so gracefully.       Wait, there’s more.       If no photos of ourselves existed, the only “images” would be from other people’s minds. Everyone perceives things differently. Does that mean we look slightly different to each person we know and love? I’d say yes. So what’s our true form?       Good question, indeed.       About 15 years ago, I developed a condition known as rhinophyma, characterized by a large, red, bumpy or bulbous nose. This condition is significantly more common in men, especially between the ages of 50 to 70 years. I contracted it in my early 40s.       It worsened gradually, and to me, when I looked in the mirror, I saw the same careworn face. Others did not. In fact, I can honestly say it startled a few passers-by.       It required surgery to correct and my youngest referred to as the time I got my “new nose.”       Again, this is a matter of perception, which is obviously subjective. Do we see what is actually there?       My whole life shows on my face and I’m damn proud of every wrinkle, dent and irregularity. I’ve earned them all.       I look my wife’s face. In the past 25 years of marriage, I don’t think it’s changed one iota. She has the same bright smile and cute laugh. Everything about her seems perfect.       I don’t know what she sees when she looks in the mirror. But does it matter?       There’s the question we should all be asking ourselves – does it matter what I look like?       Aesop once wrote that we should look to the mind, not the outward appearance.       And Bryant McGill observed that while many show discontentment with their looks, few show it regarding their intelligence. “I, however, assure you there are many more plain minds than faces,” he said.       I’ve heard that many Hollywood stars don’t like how they look on film. Many don’t watch their own movies or TV shows.       Looks, by and large, are genetic and by design. There’s very little we can to do alter them, despite the thousands of infomercials claiming otherwise. It’s the luck of the draw, the hand you’re dealt with.       But doesn’t that make you truly unique and one of a kind? Isn’t that something to celebrate?       Shakespeare once observed that God gave us one face, and yet we make another.       Here in the “civilized” world, looks are king. They are everything, especially in advertising, entertainment and furthering the affluent gene pool.       Again, our brains may disregard the useless information we absorb. It only processes and stores new information, something interesting or visually appealing. Everything else falls by the wayside.       And so it should.       I’m a big fan of things that are remarkable by being “out of place.” I love creative photos or artwork that depict dichotomies or contradictions.       I love it when people stand on the sidewalk with signs and I’m drawn to the ones that indicate the Messiah has arrived and the end is near.       I suppose my point is we don’t have to be aesthetically pleasing to be important or make a difference. I say ban all mirrors, photos, selfies, videos, even for just a day. Let’s all walk around as if we’re new to the species, meeting one another for the very first time.       I’d say things like “Oh my, what a well deserved face you have. Tell me what’s behind it.”       Let the stories flow.

Which brings us to the matter of Alteryx. How long do we think that Alteryx's platform will be one of the best solutions for data science? When you buy a stock at 16x revenues, the answer had better be pretty long. Because the company has to remain in business for a minimum of 16 years -- and pay out 100% of revenues as profits to you -- merely to return the price you paid up front. In most realistic scenarios, a company needs to survive even longer to generate decent returns for investors. The math is less severe if a company is still growing rapidly, but growth has evaporated at Alteryx.

BOCA RATON Fla., Oct. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hoteliers are bracing for a tenuous tourist season as the fallout from the COVID-19 recession lingers, but deep discounting should not be part of the recovery playbook, said Peter Ricci, Ed.D, director of the Hospitality and Tourism Management program in Florida Atlantic University’s College of Business.
 Ricci contends that hotels should keep rates what they were prior to the pandemic and instead institute a bare-bones operation that includes reduced staffing and expenses with only a small percentage of rooms available to reserve.
 “This will maintain brand integrity and the quality expectations without denigrating the experience,” he said. “Once doors are opened to guests at lower rates, they will anticipate similar rates in the future.”
 Ricci has more than 20 years of managerial experience in hospitality industry segments such as food service, lodging and destination marketing.
 Hospitality is the largest private employer in Florida with more than 1.1 million people working in the industry. Estimates showed that roughly half of those workers were laid off or had hours reduced at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this spring when it disrupted nearly every aspect of American life. Many workers have since returned to their previous jobs, but their futures remain uncertain as hotels grapple with declining revenue amid a still-soft travel market.
 In April, the average daily rate (ADR) for hotel rooms across the United States plummeted 45 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to analytics firm STR, the leading source of data for the lodging industry. The ADR has improved each month since, but still was down 23 percent in August.
 STR notes that post-9/11, room rates fell sharply for 12 months and took double that time for the ADR to return to what it was prior to the terrorist attack, the firm said. The rebound from the financial crisis of 2008 took roughly the same amount of time.
 As the traditional tourist season looms, property owners can slowly reopen more rooms and add staff while maintaining rates near pre-pandemic levels, Ricci said. He suggests offering an increase in value rather than simply deep price discounts. For example, hotels can stand out from the competition with built-in items, amenities and services, such as free face masks, hand sanitizer in the rooms and a list of local restaurants noted for social distancing.
 Hotels should consider rehiring management professionals to help maximize revenue streams as part of a daily strategy once the crisis passes, according to Ricci, but getting customers back through the lobby doors by slashing rates is a bad precedent that can have long-lasting repercussions.
 “Don’t just drop the rates 50 percent or more to get back in business. Offer a value so you can stay in business,” he said. “Hoteliers need to panic less, strategize more and move forward.”

JOHANNESBURG – With parts of Gauteng experiencing thunderstorms the weather service said strong winds and localised flooding remains on the cards for the weekend.          The weather service issued a level 2 alert for potential severe downpours earlier this week, with several parts of the province expected to be hit by some rough weather conditions.          Forecaster Celeste Sourie said the cool conditions were expected to persist into the weekend and has urged residents to stay vigilant of changing conditions.          “At the moment there is a thunderstorm just west of the Lanseria Airport, and we have a thunderstorm approaching the Heidelberg area. For the rest of the afternoon, there are some thunderstorms making their way to the northern parts of Gauteng. They will continue into the evening and then looking into tomorrow, the chances of thunderstorms are reaching about 30%.”          Meanwhile, the Johannesburg Metro Police Department's Wayne Minnaar has also advised residents to exercise extreme caution on the roads.          “It would be necessary to reduce speed on wet roads and to keep a safe following distance as vehicles tend to skid out of control when braking harshly.”

MANHATTAN -- If the past seven months of life with the coronavirus pandemic has taught them nothing else, the Kansas State Wildcats have learned the margin for error with the accompanying uncertainty is razor thin.                           They have to remain vigilant.                           And that was Chris Klieman's message to his team as soon as they stepped off the field last week following an emotional 38-35 upset victory on the road against Oklahoma.                           Neither Texas Tech, which visits Bill Snyder Family Stadium at 2:30 p.m. Saturday for the Wildcats' Big 12 home opener, nor the virus, care much what happened a week ago.                           Much like K-State, Texas Tech (1-1, 0-1 Big 12), raised its game in the Big 12 opener, leading No. 8-ranked Texas in the closing minutes of regulation before falling in overtime, 56-53. The Red Raiders barely survived their season debut two weeks before that, edging Houston Baptist, 35-33.                           Following K-State's disappointing 35-31 loss to Arkansas State in the season opener, Klieman implored the Wildcats to take stock and redouble their efforts in the two weeks leading up to Oklahoma. Now they must guard against turning into one-hit wonders.                           "They did a great job, and it just can't be one game," Klieman said. "It has to be sustained.                           "We need to do this for the long haul, and that's the challenge we made to our guys. We didn't play well in week one and you lose. We played well (and) played hard in week two and had an opportunity to win."                           When you don't know what life will look at from one day to the next, there's not much point in dwelling on the past.                           "We better put it behind us in a hurry, or we're going to not be ready on Saturday," Klieman said. "What we did today is great, but it pales in comparison to what you can do the next day.                           "And right now we have to move on, and I think our guys did a nice job of that on Monday. But that's been kind of our mantra for the last year plus, is tack great days and don't worry about yesterday. Worry about today and let's win the dang day, and we're going to try to do that today."                           Sophomore defensive tackle Jaylen Pickle, who made his first career start against the Sooners, heard the message loud and clear.                           "Every day is a different day," said Pickle, who started in place of Eli Huggins. "You've got to win every single day and then it's just build on every day and every win, and build on every loss, too, because there is always something you can learn."                           Pickle got the start when Huggins was unavailable. The Wildcats also were without cornerbacks Lance Robinson and Kiondre Thomas and running back Harry Trotter among others, presumably as a result of positive COVID-19 tests or contact tracing.                           And that's the other reason the Wildcats can't let their guard down.                           It forced them to shuffle positions in the secondary, with Jahron McPherson moving from free to strong safety and cornerback AJ Parker to nickel, while sophomore Ekow Boye-Doe and junior college transfer Justin Gardner drawing their first starts at the corners. It also gave electric freshman Deuce Vaughn a bigger role at running back, where fellow true freshman Keyon Mozee also came up big with a 78-yard pass reception.                           Because he and his staff don't know for sure who will be available from one week to the next or even on a daily baseball, they have had to prepare more players at the cost of developing continuity at certain positions.                           "So let's throw that pandemic word out there again," Klieman said. "Let's put all our eggs in one kid's basket and all of a sudden that kid goes down on Wednesday or Friday.                           "Now we have to find a way to get all those reps to somebody that we could have split those reps up (earlier).                           "Really, that's at every position for us. We're trying to get the reps evenly distributed, so that when something does happen and a guy goes down, we can't say that kid has only had 10 snaps and now we've got to play him 50."                           Klieman's staff already embraced a philosophy of utilizing any players they felt were up to the job, and it paid off against Oklahoma, where the Wildcats rallied from a 21-point second-half deficit.                           "The biggest examples I would use is of our game last week and when you watch the Texas Tech game last week," said offensive coordinator Courtney Messingham. "I felt as if we were as fresh and ready to go as you could be in the fourth quarter. And I felt that, when you watch the game, we were in better shape.                           "And it wasn't because each individual was probably in better shape, but we use as many people as we can. When you watch the Texas Tech game, by the fourth quarter and overtime, you could see that they were two teams that were gassed. They were spent."                           The Wildcats definitely will need to keep fresh on defense against a high-powered Tech offense that ranks 10th nationally in total offense, seventh in passing and ninth in scoring. Quarterback Alan Bowman averages 377.5 passing yards per game, completing 66 percent of his attempts with seven touchdown and four interceptions.                           Tech also has the Big 12's leading rusher in SaRodorick Thompson, who has run for 222 yards and four touchdowns.                           With what has been a revolving door in the secondary for K-State, plus the fact that Texas Tech pushes the tempo offensively, linebacker Elijah Sullivan said it is imperative that the Wildcats are on the same page.                           "It just gets you a different guy to communicate to, and that's what we've been working on throughout the whole time we've been back," Sullivan said. "Just being able to communicate as a defense, as a whole, no matter who's back there.                           "We have had a lot of guys kind of move around. As you know, Jahron (McPherson) was back there at strong safety this week. But the biggest thing is communication no matter who's out there."

Kansas' U.S. senators announced Friday they are partnering on a bill to extend how long local governments, state agencies and health care facilities have to spend federal COVID-19 relief funds, a key request from many stakeholders.                           Kansas received more than $1.25 billion in CARES Act funds earlier this year and a state taskforce has earmarked almost all of those funds for counties, as well as projects ranging from rural broadband to helping improve the state's COVID-19 testing strategy.                           But throughout that process, stakeholders have been cognizant of the looming Dec. 31 deadline to spend all the money. Any remaining funds not spent by that point will return to the federal government.                           But both of Kansas' Republican U.S. senators, Jerry Moran and Pat Roberts, announced legislation, dubbed the Remove Impediments for a Successful Economic Recovery Act, to extend the deadline to December 2022                           "By providing an extension to CRF payments, we are ensuring local governments throughout Kansas and the country are able to utilize this critical funding in the best, most effective way possible and within a more reasonable timeframe," Roberts said in a statement.                           County governments, some of which have yet to receive their share of CARES Act funds from the state, have been concerned that the Dec. 31 deadline puts them under the gun to make use of the money, whether by helping businesses acquire personal protective equipment or helping municipalities within their borders.                           "As soon as we heard that the money was going to have to be spent by the end of the year, all of our brains exploded," said Crawford County Commissioner Jeremy Johnson.                           The deadline has made it challenging to use funds in areas like broadband deployment or other infrastructure projects, which are likely to be difficult to complete by year's end.                           And nursing homes and other health care facilities yet untouched by the virus have said they would like to save any funds they got from the CARES Act for later, in the event infections occur in 2021.                           That is especially true, long-term care advocates say, in the event flu season and COVID-19 strain resources further.                           "I need that money Jan. 1," Holly Noble, a representative from the Kansas Adult Care Executives Association, told the Joint KanCare Oversight Committee on Monday.                           The legislation mirrors a similar bill from U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., to extend the deadline to 2021.

There’s an inconspicuous shop on Schomberg’s Main Street. Artistic and intriguing.       The door is wide open and behind the heavy, theatre style burgundy curtain is an eclectic office.       At first glance, it’s part museum, part design studio. Unlike other shops, this one also houses a modern replica of Leonardo da Vinci’s flying machine.       G2Net, a “court-ordered” non-profit dedicated to delivering aid to developing countries, is part of one man’s multi-faceted passion, or perhaps obsession. It’s also home to UNICORN Aerospace – Universal Cartographic Orbital Rotational Navigation. This is a strategic multi-dimensional geo-spacial mapping technology. The company develops advanced aerospace technologies for private industry and the military.       Pretty cool stuff. The quaint Schomberg storefront has an air of mystery, a feeling of something much bigger.       Andre Milne is a pilot, former military man, artist and aeronautical designer. His passion hovers in the sky but he’s a logical man, driven by a search for the truth. He’s also an admitted skeptic, believing only what he can see and prove. He’s also a trained flight data analyst, who’s uncovered evidence surrounding some of the most mysterious air crashes in recent history.       Milne is unassuming, intelligent and quite personal. His laid-back nature belies his skills, covert military experience and investigative abilities. These same skills, and his tenacity, have drawn the attention of government officials and military personnel alike.       Milne formed G2 Net in 1994, with support from the Toronto Police. The goal was to collect and deliver humanitarian donations to refugees in the Caucasus area of the former Soviet Union, something not quite fashionable at the time. The idea was to have Canadian police offers on the ground in the region, giving the project legitimacy and a certain amount of might.       He saw G2Net as a vehicle to accelerate aid in real time.       In the process, he identified inefficiencies and red tape hurdles among top international aid organizations. Delivering aid to Muslim countries in the Middle East proved challenging. The name used in those countries for the Red Cross is Red Crescent, a moniker adopted by the Ottoman Empire in 1906. Red Crescent provides disaster and conflict relief in those regions.       When he tried to launch an aid program to Somalia, the idea was simple enough – Canadians bringing humanitarian aid to Somalians. It was an attempt, he said, to open relations with that part of the world.       A lot of challenges and regulatory issues forced Milne to put G2Net in mothballs for a time.       The time is now.       His philanthropic side, and ultimate goals, have never waned. He’s adamant that any and all donations, particularly monetary donations, get to those in need. He’s eliminated a bloated administration that plagues many NGOs and non-profits. Instead, his efforts are self-funded. Some exciting future fundraising plans, and a fantastic aerial project, are in the offing. He hopes to “launch” everything soon.       To raise funds, Milne has created the Stealth Aerial History Tour, a world-wide trip via a unique biomechanical aircraft, the Stealth. Modelled after da Vinci’s flying machine, the pedal-propelled light aircraft with hang-glider like wings is aiming to set some records. It’s also designed to generate funds for those who desperately need it.       Milne is planning a tour with the Stealth, live-streaming sights and sounds of some of the world’s wonders and marvels. Using a pay per view per flight method, viewers will log in and watch as the craft and pilot navigate over such places as the Great Wall of China or the Pyramids of Giza. Enlisting the support of various countries and their own athletes or celebrities, each leg of the journey will have nationalistic flare. It may just help bring some countries and cultures together, in a time of uncertainty and conflict.       He hopes to raise money and then simply give it all away.       Milne sees human-powered flight as the “holy grail of flight.” It’s pure and simple, almost an extension of the human form. Through his craft, and this project, he hopes to inspire the hearts and minds of people who literally shoot for the stars.       Milne shares some amazing, albeit redacted stories, ranging from UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) and black ops to government cover-ups.       Milne uses hard data to prove his case.       He’s turned his attention to investigating some major airline crashes, and has uncovered some interesting evidence.       His interest was piqued when he began doing a forensic analysis of EgyptAir 990. The jet airliner that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean roughly 100 kilometres south of Nantucket, Massachusetts, in the early morning hours of Oct. 31, 1999. All 217 people on board died. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the actions of the copilot caused the crash, but Egyptian authorities blamed mechanical failure.       Using various radar sources, satellite readings and his own expertise, Milne believes the pilots used evasive action to avoid two objects that were posing a threat. Whether these were missiles or UAPs remains unknown.       Milne was so adamant about his findings that he lobbied MPs, Canadian government officials and even the PMO in 2003 to look at his data and share the information with Egyptian officials. He received letters of support from well known MPs at the time.       His efforts became stalled, Milne speculates, by other government agencies.       Fast-forward to 2014 and Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared March 8 on its way from Kuala Lampur to Beijing. All 227 passengers and 12 crew were presumed lost.       Investigators relied largely on Insmarsat satellite data to believe it crashed somewhere in the South China and Andaman Seas. Searches have failed to find the wreckage.       Milne’s colleague Danny Boyer, a U.S. air force member, located a satellite image believed to be the crash site in a remote part of Cambodia. Milne is now working with Boyer to get a team through the jungle to examine the site he found. The black box and the wreckage will be key to uncovering the truth.       But Milne doesn’t believe it was deliberate pilot action.       It remains as one of the biggest mysteries in air history.       The downing of Ukrainian Flight 752 on Jan. 8, 2020 caught the world’s attention. An anti-aircraft missile fired by Iranian military personnel destroyed the plane, killing all 176 passengers, including 57 Canadians.       Investigators are still waiting to recover data from the black box.       While the facts in this incident seem indisputable, Milne believes there’s much more to it than meets the eye.       He said he’s been asked by the Ukraine government to continue looking into the incident and he’s been corresponding with officials from that country. That, he said, prompted a visit recently from RCMP agents with the Integrated National Security Enforcement Team.       This further piqued Milne’s curiosity but he refused to relay any details of his investigation.       Such is a glimpse into the goings-on behind the curtain at G2Net on Schomberg’s quiet Main Street.       The Pandora’s Box of discoveries aside, Milne’s desire to help those in need is undeniable.       Help support his efforts, when he and his Stealth take to the skies.

I am not sure how to answer this question. You cannot train bias out of someone, it is part of human nature. We all favor our family over our neighbors, our neighbors over our community and our community over the community down the road. We must recognize our bias and constantly guard against it.
