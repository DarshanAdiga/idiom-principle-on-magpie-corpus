They added: "Claims that there is new evidence and witnesses have come forward are unfounded as these matters were dealt with in both trials and require no further consideration.
 "As a family who sat in court every day listening to all evidence against Morris, we would like to make it very clear that there is or never will be any doubts in our minds that the right person is behind bars and that’s David George Morris.
 "It has been very upsetting for our family, children and grandchildren seeing campaigns and hearing people claiming he’s innocent.

A federal judge in Atlanta is weighing a challenge to a Trump administration directive that halts the eviction of certain renters through the end of the year in an effort to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month issued an order barring landlords from evicting any person covered by the order from a residential property for failure to pay rent. The measure followed an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in early August that instructed public health officials to consider measures to temporarily halt evictions.
 Individual landlords from four states — Georgia, New Jersey, South Carolina and Virginia — and a trade association representing owners and managers of rental housing in all 50 states filed a lawsuit challenging the order. The inability to evict tenants who aren’t paying rent is causing them irreparable harm, they argue, and they asked the court to prohibit the enforcement of the order while the lawsuit is pending.
 The lawsuit, filed in Atlanta where the CDC is located, is one of several across the country challenging the agency’s order.

The APME region continues to perform relatively well during this crisis. Excluding restructuring charges and prior year gain on the China IPO, OUP margin decreased 90 basis points. All of the $1.5 million of restructuring costs involve Australia where we continue to simplify the business after exiting certain low margin staffing clients. Revenue growth in Japan was up 5% on a constant currency basis and, after adjusting for billing days, this represented a 6% growth rate which was equal to the growth rate in the second quarter. Our Japan business continues to perform very well and we expect a revenue trend of flat to low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Revenues in Australia declined 7% in constant currency on a days adjusted basis.

 Google went on a shopping spree that involved more than 260 acquisitions. Besides the vision of Page and Brin, many of the deals were driven by insights into trends gleaned from a search engine that constantly crawled the internet and processed billions of requests each day.

FCA declined to comment on specifics surrounding this new platform, but Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, believes the architecture could be part of FCA's coming merger with France's PSA Group. The two plan to close a 50/50 merger of their automakers next year, following which it'll be known as Stellantis. According to Fiorani, the "multi-energy" architecture could possibly come with help from its new French mate. PSA already has two ultraflexible platforms in its stable: the EMP2 and CMP architectures that support varying levels of electrification for SUVs and small cars. It very well could form the basis for FCA's own platform since it's largely avoided any major stance on electrified vehicles. That's with good reason, Fiorani said. "Nobody has proven that a significant portion of the market is ready for electric vehicles and definitely not at a profitable price."
 "The PSA platforms and vehicles have already been designed so making the adjustments for North American safety regulations is less expensive than developing a whole new vehicle from scratch," he added.

Andrew Lawson Andrew Lawson (May 22,1949 - October 14th, 2020) Our brother, and a great uncle, cousin and friend to many, especially his favorite aunts, Ann and Margaret, passed away peacefully in the early morning hours on October 14th after a very brief battle with cancer. It was just two and half weeks ago that Andrew golfed 10 out of 14 days with his brothers Matthew and James in Dutchess County. A testament to his strength and competitive fire on the golf course. The Cousins Cup, an annual family golf event that Andrew went to for 19 straight years, will never be the same without him. His love of golf may have been eclipsed only by his astonishing appetite for great food, especially when prepared by his sister Ann! When Andrew came over recipes were doubled and the cupboards were laid bare! Andrew was also an incredibly smart person and on a dark night he could mesmerize you with his knowledge of the stars and our universe. He could also talk with you about mathematics but most could only stay with him for a few minutes on this topic before you realized you were way out of his league! But as smart as Andrew was he was even kinder. Who else catches a mouse in the kitchen with a "safe" trap and then drives it a mile or so to a wildlife sanctuary. There were no sharp edges to Andrew and he was always the favorite uncle to all of his nieces and nephews. Andrew will be deeply missed by everyone whose lives he made brighter.

St. Joseph responded quickly, scoring on a 79-yard Jaeckels-to-Chris-Barganier touchdown catch-and-run.
 According to Memberto, the Knights scored the next 13 points in the game to take a 20-10 in the first half. Two field goals were sandwiched around a Jaeckles touchdown.
 St. Joseph gave Lompoc just enough time on the clock for Portis to score on a 24-yard screen pass at 1:09, capping a short four-play drive in which Lompoc quarterback Torey Sims scrambled to pass then took off running down the Lompoc sideline for a 47-yard gain.
 No one scored in the third quarter until the Knights took the ball at the Lompoc 40 and drove to the Lompoc 3 in nine plays. Cuauhtemoc Martinez hit a 20-yard field goal on the last play of the third to make the score 23-17 St. Joseph. The Knights wouldn't score again.
 After Foster's return, St. Joseph had a seven-play drive that ended when Lompoc's Corey Maxwell intercepted a pass at the Lompoc 40 and returned it to the St. Joseph 32. The Knights then had a fourth-and-11 at their own 37 but Jaeckels could only gain 10 yards, turning over the ball on downs to the Braves.
 A big key to the victory was the Lompoc defense in the red zone, Memberto wrote. Citing the three St. Joseph drives that stalled at the Lompoc 9, 10 and 3 in which St. Joseph had to settle for field goals.
 The Braves were able to then drain the clock and move to 8-0.
 "Donny (Cross) and (Paul) Terrones, it was on them," Lompoc coach Andrew Jones told Memberto that night, crediting his two defensive coaches. "They got the stops, so they should get the credit.
 "I'm fortunate as the head coach that I don't have to worry about the defensive part of the game, I can focus on special teams and offense."
 Lompoc finished 11-1 on the season. St. Joseph went 7-5, winning their next three games before losing to Newbury Park in the quarterfinals of the playoffs.
 Lompoc rushed for 245 yards on 42 carries in that game, with Sims and Hayes topping 100 yards. Jaeckels went 15 of 26 for 204 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He also scored the rushing touchdown.
 Lompoc's league win streak would largely go unchallenged until it was snapped in 2019 by Santa Barbara High after a major shift in the league landscape, with Lompoc moving to the Channel League as Santa Maria Valley schools moved to the CIF Central Section.
 Lompoc won 43 straight league games from 2010 to 2019. The Braves went nearly 3,300 days without losing in league, though St. Joseph was this close to clipping that streak much sooner.

 However, as Turmeric and Honey makes plans to open a café area at the back of the store, as per the customer surveys, the question of a possible full lockdown still looms in the background.

 # One person shot by Battle Creek police during traffic stop
 Trace Christenson
 Battle Creek Enquirer
 View Comments
 One man was injured early Tuesday after being shot by a Battle Creek police officer during a traffic stop.
 Police said the shooting occurred about 12:13 a.m. after an officer stopped a car on Columbia Avenue near LaVista Boulevard on the city's south side.
 The officer reported seeing erratic driving, including stopping and backing up in the roadway and an illegal turn.
 As the first officer spoke with the male driver outside the car, a second officer arrived and approached a man who was a front seat passenger.
 The second officer saw a gun in the waistband of the passenger, ordered the passenger to raise his hands and told the passenger the gun would be removed for safety.
 The passenger initially followed the officer's commands, police said, but as the officer reached for the gun in the waistband the passenger began to resist and reached back into the car for a second gun on the floor of the vehicle.
 The second officer fired his weapon, wounding the passenger.
 Lifecare Ambulance took the injured passenger to a hospital in Kalamazoo for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, police said in a statement released by the city.
 Neither the officers nor the driver of the car were injured.
 The driver was arrested on charges related to the traffic stop, and police said they recovered two handguns.
 The two male officers have been placed on paid administrative leave, a standard practice when officers are involved in a shooting, and Battle Creek police requested that Michigan State Police investigate the incident.

For the first nine months of 2020, Vivendi's revenues were €11,598 million, up to 2.4% (-1.1% at constant currency and perimeter 1) compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was mainly due to the growth in revenues of Vivendi's two main businesses, UMG and Canal+ Group, demonstrating the resilience of their subscription-based activities. The increase was partially offset by the slowdown in the revenues of Havas Group and Vivendi Village, which were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In seguito i blocchi sono stati trasferiti in un’area attrezzata per separare il ferro dal calcestruzzo. I lavori hanno prodotto complessivamente circa 1.200 tonnellate di materiale che, dopo gli opportuni controlli radiometrici, verranno allontanate dal sito e inviate a recupero, nell’ambito della strategia di economia circolare perseguita dalla stessa Sogin. Lo smantellamento della centrale di Latina produrrà inoltre complessivamente circa 319 mila tonnellate di materiali.

Like other seminal Silicon Valley companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Apple, Google started in a garage — one that Page and Brin rented from Susan Wojcicki, who now runs YouTube for the company. They focused on creating a database of everything on the internet through a search engine that almost instantaneously listed a pecking order of websites most likely to have what anyone wanted.
 Unlike other major search engines offered by Yahoo, AltaVista and others, Google initially only displayed 10 blue links on each page of results, with no effort to get visitors to stay on its own website.
 “We want you to come to Google and quickly find what you want. Then we’re happy to send you to the other sites. In fact, that’s the point,” Page told Playboy magazine just before the company’s initial public offering of stock in 2004.
 Google was so proficient at this that its name soon became synonymous with searching. But once Google figured out it could sell ads tied to search results, it began to make more money than Page and Brin ever envisioned. Seeing an opportunity to mine new opportunities and push technology to new frontiers, they decided to spend billions of dollars on research and acquisitions.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly has said it's time to tone down the “the anti-science, anti-mask rhetoric,\" after a retired firefighter who was upset about Wichita’s mask ordinance was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kidnap and kill the mayor. “This is serious, and we all need to get on the same page and work together,” Kelly said Monday. Police have said the man could face a charge of criminal threat. He was arrested Friday and prosecutors said he could be arraigned Tuesday afternoon, The Wichita Eagle reported. Police have said the suspect sent text messages to a city official threatening the life of Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple because of his role in the passage of a mask mandate to slow the spread of the coronavirus. “He said he was going to kidnap me and slash my throat and he needed my address because I needed to see the hangman,” Whipple said. Kelly said anger over restrictions imposed to protect public health is getting out of hand. “It’s imperative that we turn down the rhetoric — the anti-science, anti-mask rhetoric,” Kelly said. “We see what’s going on, what it has done here with the mayor of Wichita and elsewhere such as Michigan.” Members of a self-appointed militia group are facing charges accusing them of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The FBI and Michigan law enforcement have charged 14 men in connection with a domestic terrorism plot. The state health department reported Monday that Kansas had 2,113 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases since Friday, an increase of 3% that brought the total number of infections reported in the state to 72,968. The department also reported 13 additional COVID-19-related deaths, bringing the Kansas death toll to 872. Meanwhile, the coronavirus...

Are TV dramas OK? I ask because, sometime during the past decade, a format once rooted in the daily struggles of more-or-less normal human beings came a bit unglued. So-called prestige drama got darker, stranger, flashier, pulpier, scarier or simply more intense. Forced by a surplus of original content to find a gimmick, many TV creators have turned away from realistic stories, to embrace fantasy, sci-fi, superheroes, melodrama. Maybe the tipping point was _Game of Thrones_. Maybe it was _American Horror Story_ or _The Walking Dead_ or even _Downton Abbey_ 's metamorphosis from stodgy period piece to self- aware soap. Now, pay TV platforms such as HBO and Amazon are loading up on genre fare--some but not all of it great. Emotional dramas like _Six Feet Under_ and _Friday Night Lights_ have given way to the mawkish _This Is Us_. Procedurals are getting weird; _The Good Wife_ team begat _Evil_. And the most authentic, vividly wrought characters of the last several years have mostly come from half-hour dramedies: _Fleabag_, _Atlanta_, _Enlightened_, _BoJack Horseman_, _Better Things_, _Insecure_, _Catastrophe_, _Vida_.

Workers have to notify employers at least one day in advance. Employers are able to choose whether they will allow employees to take time off before or after their work shifts.
 "There's nothing in the statute that talks about how that has to be communicated, in writing or anything else, so I guess the point is, there isn’t any particular way that you need to let your employer know about this, at least according to the statute. You just need to make sure you do it at least a day in advance," Balitis said.
 "Chances are, this law is slightly less relevant in this election cycle than it has been in the past because I think, by and large, fewer people are probably going to go to the polls to vote," he added. "We’ve seen that mail in balloting and early voting by mail dropping ballots off has just surged."
 Employers who violate the law could face misdemeanor criminal charges.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy won’t square off in person with his primary Democratic challenger or any of his opponents ahead of the Nov. 3 election, marking this as Louisiana’s first Senate race in more than 20 years not to feature a TV debate. Cassidy's campaign said the GOP incumbent hasn't received a “firm invitation” to a television debate this election. But he only apparently was interested in participating in debates that would involve allowing all 14 of his competitors to crowd the stage in the coronavirus pandemic, even those who have done little to no fundraising or campaigning. “We will consider all requests that allow every candidate to participate,” Cassidy spokesman Ty Bofferding said in a statement. His chief Democratic opponent, Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins, said Cassidy is ducking the scrutiny that comes with such questioning. Perkins said “several outlets have reached out to our campaign” about debates but Cassidy hasn’t agreed to any of them. “I think he is afraid and he’s ashamed of his record,” Perkins said at a recent candidate forum that Cassidy refused to attend. Whatever the reason, this race will be Louisiana's first U.S. Senate competition without the major contenders on a TV stage hashing out the issues since 1998. The last time it happened, then-Democratic incumbent Sen. John Breaux refused to debate his main opponent, Republican Jim Donelon, then a state representative and later elected Louisiana's insurance commissioner. Over the 22 years since that election that Breaux easily won, candidates for open U.S. Senate seats and incumbents running for reelection have participated in face-to-face matchups with their opponents in six different races.

 Arbaaz, who has obtained the 85th rank in the NEET all India rankings and the third rank in the State, says that his brothers who succeed in the face of adversity, inspired him. “My parents also supported me. Four years ago my father suffered a stroke and became bed-ridden for months. But he never asked me to quit studying or take up a job. He nudged me to keep studying so that I could become a doctor and help a lot of people,” Arbaaz told _The Hindu_.
 He says he is likely to be accepted into the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. The studious youth, however, does not want to stop at MBBS. “I want to complete my post-graduation and then, take up research to create low- cost treatment for the poor,’’ he said.
 Arbaaz scored 97 % in PU and 92 % in SSLC exams. He joined the Bidar-based Shaheen PU College. The college admitted Arbaaz free, just as it had admitted his two brothers.
 “This year, we have admitted 300 students free, against our intake of 1500,” said Abdul Quadeer, secretary of Shaheen PU College that has produced NEET toppers Karthik Reddy and Arbaaz.
 Karthik Reddy’s father Rama Reddy is a professor of mechanical engineering in Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College in Bidar.
 His mother Kalpana is a government primary school teacher. “My elder brother is an engineer. He is a student of M.Tech. But I was not sure of what to do after PU. I got interested in medicine after discussing with my friends at the college,’’ he said.
 He was a day boarder who chose a semi residential model which meant he went to college at 7 in the morning only to return home at 9 p.m.. He says that he spent the lockdown period solving past question papers. The college staff came home to give the papers and collect the answer sheets every day. “We kept in touch with our teachers via phone and video conference calls,” he said.

“I have two college kids so they come home with all their dirty laundry in their hamper, and they want to put their clean laundry back in their hamper, and I say 'No, you can’t do that!'” Reynolds said.
 Bacteria can grow and multiply in your hamper.
 “You should always wipe that out after with a sanitizing wipe so that whatever germs that might have been on your dirty laundry that got in your hamper are no longer there,” Reynolds said.
 As for washing those dirty clothes, what you're already doing is probably OK.
 "Mostly, you don't need to use high-level products like sanitizers or bleach because the coronavirus is killed very easily, so just normal wash cycles are very effective for the SARS-COVID2 virus and other respiratory viruses like your cold and flu viruses."
 This means cold water is fine because COVID is an enveloped virus with a coating on the outside that is very easy to kill.
 Liquid detergent, powder, and pods all work well as long as they have the right ingredients. Reynolds and Dr. Charles Gerba, aka Dr. Germ, suggest looking for things like "deep cleaning" and "enzyme action" when picking out your detergent at the store.
 “They tend to be more expensive. But in the long run, they keep you safer, remove more debris from your laundry. They kill more germs,” Reynolds said.

“We raised as much money for the Friends of Baseball account in one day as we do with several of our events,” said Fairmont State Baseball Coach Phil Caruso. “We plan to develop a strategy again this year to take advantage of the matches and challenges and raise as much money as possible. We will reach out to donors ahead of time and on October 29 through social media and letters to encourage them to give.”
 The matches and challenges and work put into gathering support ahead of the day paid off for many academic units, programs and projects last year.
 Fairmont State faculty, alumni and friends can also sign up to be social media ambassadors for the day. A complete toolkit and suggested posts will be provided to volunteers who want to share and encourage others to give.
 Donors have contributed more than $140,000 to the Fairmont State Foundation in advance of Oct. 29 to create matches and challenges for various programs, schools and athletics, including the Academic Dollar for Dollar Match, Athletic Scholarship Match, Academic Scholarship Match, Falcon Fund Greatest Needs Dollar for Dollar Match, Board of Governors Chairmain’s Challenge, Foundation Board Chair’s Match and more.
 “The Day of Giving is not only a great and fun fundraising event, but it also highlights the importance of partnerships and the power of sharing a mission,” Mirta M. Martin, president of Fairmont State University, said. “The funds raised when donors, the Foundation, and the University team together enable us to honor our commitment to providing transformative educational experiences. In a year that has become defined by uncertainty, there’s one thing I know we can count on: The generous heart of the Falcon Family.”

Andrew Lawson      Andrew Lawson (May 22,1949 - October 14th, 2020)      Our brother, and a great uncle, cousin and friend to many, especially his favorite aunts, Ann and Margaret, passed away peacefully in the early morning hours on October 14th after a very brief battle with cancer.      It was just two and half weeks ago that Andrew golfed 10 out of 14 days with his brothers Matthew and James in Dutchess County. A testament to his strength and competitive fire on the golf course. The Cousins Cup, an annual family golf event that Andrew went to for 19 straight years, will never be the same without him.      His love of golf may have been eclipsed only by his astonishing appetite for great food, especially when prepared by his sister Ann! When Andrew came over recipes were doubled and the cupboards were laid bare!      Andrew was also an incredibly smart person and on a dark night he could mesmerize you with his knowledge of the stars and our universe. He could also talk with you about mathematics but most could only stay with him for a few minutes on this topic before you realized you were way out of his league!      But as smart as Andrew was he was even kinder. Who else catches a mouse in the kitchen with a "safe" trap and then drives it a mile or so to a wildlife sanctuary. There were no sharp edges to Andrew and he was always the favorite uncle to all of his nieces and nephews.      Andrew will be deeply missed by everyone whose lives he made brighter.

China’s super wealthy have earned a record $1.5 trillion in 2020, more than the past five years combined, as e-commerce and gaming boomed during pandemic lockdowns, an annual rich list said on Tuesday.
 An extra 257 people also joined the billionaires club in the world’s number- two economy by August, following two years of shrinking membership, according to the closely watched Hurun Report. The country now has a total of 878 billionaires. The U.S. had 626 people in the top bracket at the start of the year, according to Hurun in its February global list.
 The report found that there were around 2,000 individuals with a net worth of more than 2 billion yuan ($300 million) in August, giving them a combined net worth of $4 trillion.
 Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce titan Alibaba, once again topped the list after his wealth surged a whopping 45% to $58.8 billion as online shopping firms saw a surge in business. He was followed by Pony Ma ($57.4 billion), boss of gaming giant Tencent who made an extra 50% despite concerns about his firm’s U.S. outlook after it was threatened with bans there over national security fears.

Mohammad Arbaaz Ahmed was in eighth standard when his father suffered a paralytic stroke. He remembers his brothers carrying their father Mohammad Saleemoddin to hospitals in Basava Kalyan and Bidar. Doctors said that it may be a result of an accident or injury in the past. They began a series of treatments, but little came of it.
 He lost his job and was barely mobile. His wife started working as a house help to keep the hearth warm. Saleemoddin was a lorry driver handling goods vehicles between Mumbai and Hyderabad. He worked overtime to feed his large family and send his children to school.
 But the illness affected the family badly.
 This, however, did not deter the children from succeeding in school. His eldest son got into an engineering college, another got into medicine and the third became a dentist.
 Arbaaz, who has obtained the 85th rank in the NEET all India rankings and the third rank in the State, says that his brothers who succeed in the face of adversity, inspired him. “My parents also supported me. Four years ago my father suffered a stroke and became bed-ridden for months. But he never asked me to quit studying or take up a job. He nudged me to keep studying so that I could become a doctor and help a lot of people,” Arbaaz told _The Hindu_.
 He says he is likely to be accepted into the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. The studious youth, however, does not want to stop at MBBS. “I want to complete my post-graduation and then, take up research to create low- cost treatment for the poor,’’ he said.

Preparations by various parties for the elections to the District Central Co- operative Bank in Belagavi have led to significant political developments.
 The State Cooperative Election Authority has announced that the filing of nomination papers, and voting, if necessary, will be held on November 6.
 The 16-member financial institution mostly had BJP leaders heading it in the recent years.
 Current president of the DCC Bank Ramesh Katti, younger brother of the former Minister Umesh Katti has been occupying office for 17 years, while his political rival and Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi has served as cooperative president for five years.
 In 2015, Mr. Ramesh Katti defeated Mr. Savadi by a single vote when he polled nine votes against Mr. Savadi's eight.
 It was suspected that the lone government nominee favoured Mr. Ramesh Katti. That the two belonged to the same party did not seem to matter.
 This time around, Mr. Savadi has two interesting allies — the Jolle couple from Nippani and the Sangh Parivar.
 MP from Chikkodi Anna Saheb Jolle has been a long-standing director of the bank. His wife and Minister for Women and Child Welfare Shashikala Jolle is a national-level office-bearer of the Sangh Parivar-affiliate Sahakara Bharati, a federation of co-operative societies.
 Senior RSS functionaries held a meeting with DCC Bank aspirants in the house of RSS leader Arvind Rao Deshpande in Athani twice this month.
 District in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi exposed cracks in the party when he said that he would abide by the decisions taken by his brother and BJP MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi and Mr. Umesh Katti in relation to issues involving the bank. Another meeting is scheduled on Wednesday.
 It was interpreted as if he would not side with the Savadi and Jolle group.
 Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi is said to enjoy the confidence of all his brothers, including Congress leader Satish Jarkiholi.
 In the Congress camp, Channaraj Hattiholi, brother of MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar, seems anxious to contest.
 The MLA, however, has denied it.
 DCC Bank polls have gathered interest as local politics in Belagavi tends to have repercussions at the State level.
 Two years earlier, the choice of candidates for the Belagavi Taluk Rural Development Bank led to a bitter battle between Ms. Lakshmi Hebbalkar and the Jarkiholi brothers that shook State politics.

With infection rates rising and social distancing measures becoming the norm, the need for new voting options became urgent overnight. Counties that previously fielded a few thousand absentee ballot requests were suddenly flooded with hundreds of thousands of voters asking to cast ballots remotely, and election boards were suddenly to find enough people willing to risk exposure to COVID-19 to be poll workers. The prospect of long lines to vote--a sign of poorly functioning election systems in normal times--now seemed potentially life-threatening.

Northwest High School seniors soon will be recognized for their efforts beyond academics thanks to a new award.
 The Northwest Education Foundation recently created an endowment in honor of James and Martha McGahan, two longtime Northwest High School educators. Gian Baxter-Collins, executive director of the foundation, said the idea for the award came about after some foundation board members suggested it at a meeting.
 “A few board members and I met with the McGahans to ask them if they would be comfortable and open to doing this. We had a pretty touching conversation on that,” Baxter-Collins said. “You cannot talk to a Northwest graduate who graduated before 2000 and not have the McGahans come up in the conversation. They are a staple to the high school. They both were at Northwest for so long, and every student was touched by one or both of them.”
