ORWIGSBURG — An argument over trash dumping allegedly led to a threat against a day care operator that will land a Schuylkill Haven man in Schuylkill County Court.
 Carl M. Dannenhower, 79, of 303 Haven St., waived his right to a preliminary hearing Tuesday on charges of terroristic threats, disorderly conduct and unlawful depositing of waste.
 Magisterial District Judge James R. Ferrier bound over those three charges for court after Dannenhower waived his right to the hearing. Ferrier allowed Dannenhower to remain free on $5,000 unsecured bail pending further court action.
 Schuylkill Haven borough police alleged Dannenhower threatened to kill Gina Cappell, director of the day care center at Jerusalem Evangelical Lutheran Church, 252 Dock St., at 8:44 a.m. July 12.
 “ ‘Come here, I’ll kill you,’ ” Dannenhower said to Cappell at the end of their argument over Dannenhower dumping his garbage at the church.
 Police said Cappell told Dannenhower he could not dump his garbage in the church’s dumpster. The two then began to argue, which led to the threat, according to police.
 After the threat, Cappell became alarmed, left the area and called 911, police said.
 Two other women said they saw Dannenhower dump his garbage in the dumpster and one took photographs, police said.
 Dannenhower now will head to the county court, where he will have the option of pleading guilty to some or all of the charges or pleading not guilty and demanding a jury trial.

BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - On a scorching hot September day in Auburn, Ala., LSU kicker Cole Tracy delivered one of the most memorable moments in program history under immense pressure. In a recent interview, Tracy recalled that thrilling afternoon on The Plains and how the 2018 Tigers sent LSU in the right direction to deliver its unbelievable national championship campaign the following year.On Sept. 15, 2018, Tracy drilled a 42-yard field goal at the gun in a roaring Jordan-Hare Stadium to lift his Tigers to a thrilling 22-21 win over No. 7 Auburn. Suddenly, an LSU team that was thought to possibly be a disaster was sitting at 3-0 on the season after also thrashing No. 8 Miami, 33-17, in the season opener. Thanks to a 36-16 rout later of No. 2 Georgia at home and then a 40-32 triumph in The Fiesta Bowl that ended No. 7 Central Florida’s 26-game winning streak, the 2018 LSU Tigers finished 10-3 overall and No. 8 in the country. Tracy made a stellar 29-of-33 field goals that year, turning out to be, without question, a huge recruit by head coach Ed Orgeron and his staff that stabilized the program.

At some point this summer, I’m sure you noticed it.
 Maybe it was on your way to the grocery store, or out for an evening drive. Maybe you were there in person to see your son or grandson play and couldn’t find a place to park.
 As you drove past the local Little League field, high school field or community park, there it was ... a full parking lot or a street lined with cars and a large crowd of people watching the game.
 All across Schuylkill County this summer, baseball and softball fields at every age level were filled with playing youngsters being cheered on by large crowds.
 As a newspaper staff we covered the Schuylkill County Teener League’s seasons in both the Senior Division and Junior Division, chronicled the Schuylkill- Berks Independent Baseball League’s season that ended with Hamburg capturing the crown and took photos at the Pottsville Babe Ruth League’s championship tilt.
 As a baseball umpire I witnessed first-hand the Schuylkill Haven and Cressona Little League programs hold regular seasons and postseason tournaments for players ages 7-12, got a chance to work a game in the 16-team Lehigh Valley High School Invitational held in the Allentown and Bethlehem areas, and did a couple of games at a 16-and-under tournament held recently at the Pottsville Babe Ruth Field that included a team from Lebanon County.
 Similar youth leagues were held throughout the county in both baseball and softball, there was a similar 16-team Lehigh Valley Invitational in softball, and hundreds of local players participated on travel baseball and softball teams that competed in tournaments all across the state and beyond.
 There have been no reports of massive positive tests and infections from COVID-19, no overwhelming rush of patients at local hospitals or an abundance of deaths on the obituary page.
 With all of that being said, why not let it continue? Why not play high school baseball and softball in the fall?
 As we press forward in this coronavirus pandemic world, the status of high school fall sports is in question. Mainly, the issue is the contact sports of football and soccer, in which large numbers of players and fans are the norm.
 Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf “recommended” that all school and youth sports be stopped until Jan. 1, 2021, to prevent the spread of the virus. His office has said in recent days that Wolf won’t make his recommendation a mandate and officially shut down all fall sports, but we don’t really know that for sure if new medical data is presented.
 The PIAA, meanwhile, will officially vote at its board meeting Friday whether or not to go against Wolf’s recommendation and continue with fall sports this season. The state’s governing body already has delayed the start of those fall sports seasons by two weeks — first official practices Aug. 24, first football games Sept. 11 — and several conferences and school districts across the state have decided to either cancel their fall sports seasons or delay them.
 In recent days, both executive director Robert Lombardi and assistant executive director Melissa Mertz have publicly presented their case for the PIAA to press forward, with Mertz going on WITF radio on Monday and Lombardi speaking in front of the state’s Athletic Oversight Committee on Tuesday. Both said the protocols are safely in place for Pennsylvania to conduct fall sports seasons.
 But instead of conducting football and soccer seasons this fall, why not try a hybrid-like approach?
 Switch baseball and softball to the fall, move football, soccer and volleyball to the spring.
 Think about it for a moment, and you’ll realize it’s very feasible.
 The baseball and softball players that lost their spring high school seasons, but have played all summer, get a chance to immediately return to the diamond. The 2020 high school regular season was slated to run from March 20 through May 9, a span of 51 days. If switched to the fall, it’s conceivable that if the season started Sept. 11 (or earlier), the regular season could be completed by the end of October, with a postseason of district and state playoffs continuing until mid-November.
 It might be a little cold in November, but when you think about it, we’ve had some pretty mild winters around here lately. I’ve covered baseball games in March that were much colder than the weather in November. It’s doable.
 Football is played at the college level in the spring, the PIAA conducts boys’ volleyball in the spring and girls’ soccer in Schuylkill and Berks counties was played in the spring for years. Having those seasons start sometime in March and finish in early June is extremely possible. It would also allow for a complete, 10-game football season, which is something we won’t have if the PIAA presses to move forward under the current arrangement.
 What about the other sports? Regardless of what the PIAA decides Friday, I think golf, tennis and cross country should be held right now without issue. My only question would be what to do with track and field, since many track athletes play football. You can’t move track to the fall and still have cross country. Some compromise would be needed there.
 As for the fans, we’ve seen all summer that spectators can attend baseball and softball games without issue. A little more social distancing would be nice, but it was impressive to look up from the field while umpiring and see a hill or grandstand lined with loud, screaming fans.
 By the spring, we should have a better handle on the coronavirus where fans can attend football, soccer and volleyball games like normal. For the fans, the switch makes a lot of sense. Your kids get to play, and you get to see them play in person.
 The winter sports of basketball, wrestling and swimming? ... Hopefully by then our world is in a better position to deal with things. We can cross that bridge when we get there.
 For now, if holding high school and youth sports in the fall is a priority, switching baseball and softball to the fall and putting football, soccer and volleyball in the spring might be the way to get it done.

The illnesses appear to be slowing. FDA’s traceback investigation identified several farms in the U.S. that may have provided product used in the Fresh Express salads that were recalled. FDA investigated multiple farms identified in the traceback. In Florida, FDA analyzed water samples from two public access points along a regional water management canal (C-23), located west of Port St. Lucie, Florida. These samples tested positive for _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ using FDA’s validated testing method. Given the emerging nature of genetic typing methodologies for this parasite, the FDA has been unable to determine if the _Cyclospora_ detected in the canal is a genetic match to the clinical cases, therefore, there is currently not enough evidence to conclusively determine the cause of this outbreak. Nevertheless, the current state of the investigation helps advance what we know about _Cyclospora_ and offers important clues to inform future preventive measures.

For the most part, employment dictates one's insurance.
 The United States is the only major developed economy where being unemployed — as millions have been since the crisis began — means losing health insurance coverage.
 There are options, but most are cost-prohibitive for someone whose only income is unemployment benefits. The bureaucratic red tape also complicates getting the right care.
 Amaya's entire family depended on his income. Now, they are mired in financial uncertainty as well as sorrow.
 "While they're mourning his death, (they are) also coping with a tremendous financial burden," said Wendi Walsh, an officer in Unite Here Local 355, a hospitality workers' union.
 The Amayas have "a huge medical bill … and also the cost of his funeral, and that's the last thing that this family should be having to cope with right now while they're mourning."
 Amaya's relatives say they cannot possibly pay what they fear will be tens of thousands of dollars owed to the hospital — or even the mortgage.
 So far, they have not received a bill. It could arrive weeks or months down the road.
 FAIR Health, a nonprofit organization that analyzes health care claims data, says that COVID-19 patients without insurance could end up with an average of $73,000 in debt.
 Amaya was one of hundreds who lost their jobs at the Fontainebleau. He had worked there for 11 years as a banquet manager.
 His family is angry and says the hotel did not make it possible for those laid off to get continued coverage under the federal COBRA law — a claim the Fontainebleau denies.
 Its vice president of marketing, Josh Herman, also said the hotel "is not required to provide health benefits for laid-off workers, as is true of virtually all private employers."
 In any case, the premiums for COBRA coverage are high, especially for those out of work, explains Eneida Roldan, a professor and CEO of the Florida International University Health Care Network.
 The unemployed could, however, take advantage of so-called Obamacare coverage, created by former President Barack Obama, for which premiums are subsidized.
 "But it's a complex system," Roldan says. "Not everyone understands it and there is little information available that explains how to access it."
 For the Amayas, it's already too late. They feel abandoned at their greatest hour of need.
 "I feel very angry and disappointed," says Amaya's teenage son German.
 "We had to fight to get to where we are, and we're treated as if we don't deserve what we have."

In light of these facts, the Biden campaign has refused to endorse providing subsidized health-care benefits to the undocumented, advocating instead for them to merely be allowed to pay out of pocket for plans sold on the ACA exchanges (Biden does support a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, which, if implemented, would ostensibly provide those already here with full eligibility for welfare programs). But the DNC video draws no such distinctions. To the contrary, it suggests that health-care is a right that extends to all people, no matter how much they earn or where they live.

 Speaking to BBC News on Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock did not rule out a local lockdown.
 He said: "Places like Oldham, where we are now seeing the number of cases rise, we have to take the same localised approach, working very closely with the local council, and make sure we get both the messages to the public and also the rules right in place and the resources, like the testing resources, to get a grip on it in all the areas where there is an outbreak, including Oldham.
