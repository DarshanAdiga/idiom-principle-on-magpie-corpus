Rage that the wisdom and experience of scientists and doctors and other experts have been dismissed or downplayed since the beginning of this pandemic.
 Sorrow for the hundreds of thousands of lives lost and families shattered and rituals upended and joy deferred since March.
 Fear, obviously.
 It was all there, swirling around in my slightly broken heart.
 The spinal tap was inconclusive. I had the proteins that indicate meningitis, but not the white blood cells. I was moved to a room in the COVID-19 unit, where I saw a series of doctors for the next three days.
 I was given blood thinner shots in my upper arms to prevent a stroke. A nurse drew my blood every four hours to check my troponin levels. I had another EKG and an ultrasound of my heart. I had a CT scan and MRI of my brain. The MRI took place at 1:30 a.m. because that’s when there was an opening.
 As the MRI technologist wheeled me back to wait for hospital transport to return me to my room, he asked when I was first diagnosed. I told him my positive test was 12 days prior.
 “You’re lucky,” he told me.
 I didn’t feel lucky. Everything hurt. My arms were covered in bruises from the IVs and blood thinner shots. I was lonely and worried about my kids, home and worried about me. I was tired in a way I had never experienced.
 But he was right. I was lucky. I went home the next day. My troponin levels were starting to decrease and a neurologist gave me the all-clear. I was ordered to rest and avoid stress as much as possible.
 The next eight days at home I had to wrap ice packs around my head and secure them in place with a stocking cap to dull the headaches. I didn’t move much from the couch. Slowly I started to add activities back — walks with my family, card games at our kitchen table. I had a follow-up MRI of my heart to check for myocarditis and none was detected, meaning the cardiac injury is likely acute, rather than chronic. I feel pretty good now, seven weeks after I was diagnosed.
 I am lucky.
 And I’m scared — about how many more infections, hospitalizations, deaths lie ahead of us, about spikes across the country, about folks gathering for Thanksgiving.
 I wavered about writing this. I hear a lot from the COVID-is-overblown crowd and I hear a lot from the (screw)-your-feelings crowd and this story is an invitation, I realize, for blowback from both.
 But this virus is far from done with us. And it serves no one for me to keep an experience with it shrouded in mystery. Too much about COVID-19 has been shrouded in mystery.
 I wish we had a national testing strategy and a national mask mandate and daily, credible briefings about the latest coronavirus science and statistics and strategies. We have none of those things.
 But we have each other. And our fates are intertwined. That’s never felt more beautiful or more terrifying. I still believe we can rise to the occasion, especially with principled, kind leadership nudging us, guiding us from the top. I have high hopes for presumptive President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 task force.
 I have high hopes for our ability and willingness to protect one another. It is, in fact, our only option to defeat this virus, which has already stolen so much.

He called Kulick’s a “good neighborhood store” and said its new proprietors plan to expand its selection of groceries and other items, given the lack of similar vendors nearby.
 “It’s literally only one [grocery] store in Winchester, so we want to keep what people need,” he said.
 The Mahavir group would also like to establish an Aroma Joe’s, the regional coffee shop chain, at the gas station and is exploring plans to turn the adjacent car wash, which it also purchased, into a Taco Bell franchise, according to Patel.
 The Plifka family had owned Kulick’s for its entire 111-year existence, having founded the market in 1909, until its sale Monday.
 Stanley Plifka Sr. operated the store for five decades, according to his 2006 obituary in the Brattleboro Reformer. He and Butch ran Kulick’s together for multiple decades before the younger Plifka took the reins completely 25 years ago, he said Friday.
 A Winchester native, Butch Plifka explained that as owner, he tried to follow his father’s example of treating customers fairly and being an active and generous community member.
 “I’d like people to remember me as somebody who was kind to people that were less fortunate than us,” he said.

Sewell is hands down the best left tackle in this year’s class. However, Darrisaw is the front runner for No. 2. Michigan’s Jalen Mayfield, Texas’ Sam Cosmi, Northwestern’s Rashawn Slater, and Norte Dame’s Liam Eichenburg all have a chance to boost their draft stock. However, given his elite athleticism that NFL coaches will crave, you can probably go ahead and lock in Darrisaw as OT2 in this class.

To join Interact, students have to be nominated by their teachers and then are reviewed by the organization’s board of directors. O’Mara was nominated his freshman year, ran for a spot on the board of directors at the end of that year and has served in that role ever since.
 “Being part of Interact — going to Puerto Rico and also just doing the events — it’s very fulfilling,” O’Mara said. “Without Interact, I wouldn’t have been exposed to all these opportunities to volunteer and go to these places and do community service.
 “It’s helpful for me to have access to all these events,” O’Mara added. “I don’t think I’d be as involved as I am without Interact because I simply wouldn’t know about the things that we’re doing.”
 O’Mara is also part of the National Honor Society, an organization recognizing students for their academic accomplishments.
 As a senior, O’Mara has been full-steam-ahead on the college search. He said that his AP Environmental Science class that he took junior year inspired him to pursue the sciences in college.
 “That was probably one of the best, if not the best, class I’ve taken in high school,” O’Mara said. “A lot of the opportunities — we had these enrichments where you had to get involved outside of class and it was for a grade, and, I don’t know, I just had a lot of fun with it.”
 Science has been a big part of the on-going college search – although he’s not sure exactly which sciences he wants to pursue. He just knows that he wants the opportunity to do research or get involved outside in a larger way outside of just class.
 He also hopes to pursue a Spanish program in college so he can study abroad in a Spanish-speaking country.
 Soccer is going to take a back seat in college. O’Mara said academics will be his main focus at the next level.
 “I realized, probably around sophomore year, that I really wanted to focus on academics in college,” O’Mara said. “It seemed like a lot of commitment to try to play soccer. Even if I went DIII, it’s still a lot of commitment.”
 But club soccer is not out of the question.
 “I feel like club would be a way for me to have fun with it,” O’Mara said.
 One way or another, O’Mara seems to be on a pathway to success — and people around him are already taking notice.
 “He’s a real gifted kid,” Pierce said.

Even as good news on the vaccine front has people all over the nation envisioning an eventual end to the pandemic that’s claimed more than a quarter-million U.S. lives and thrown the nation’s economy into a tailspin, each day brings news of new ways in which the novel coronavirus exacts a toll on our society.
 One such effect became apparent this week when the N.H. Department of Education released an estimate of state adequacy aid for school districts for the next fiscal year. Poorer districts receive targeted state aid based on the percentage of their students receiving free or discounted school lunches. That qualifier is a frequently used metric by state and federal agencies because it’s a simple test: families near or below the federal poverty level qualify for discounted meals.
 The big caveat to that system is that parents have to apply, giving their incomes to the school districts, in order to receive the benefit. Some don’t want to divulge that information, due to pride or fear or other reasons, or don’t know they qualify. Others, sadly, can’t be bothered.

I made it an entire eight days. I wish I could point to one particular circumstance that derailed me, but it was not just one thing. It was a global pandemic that is surging, and political and societal unrest. It was unsettledness, worry, and anxiety in the lives of people I love. It was concern for people who are in need of healing in body, mind, and spirit. It was life, in all its ups and downs and twists and turns; in all its beauty and sadness and complexity and busyness.

Broadway is back! Well, sort of.

 Theatrical performances have long been a staple of the annual New York City celebration, which will operate differently this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I’ve struggled to write a column that isn’t all doom and gloom, and frankly, it’s been very difficult. But here’s a few consoling thoughts to ponder these days before Thanksgiving.
 We’re pretty resilient folk, for the most part. It’s been bumpy but many have been going about their jobs in yeomanlike fashion. The employees at clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, dental offices are soldiering on. The home- healthcare nurses are hard at work, tending to the sick. Utility crews labor diligently in the cold outdoors, the newspaper is still published, grocery stores are filled with food. This week I happened to see an armada of UPS trucks leaving their Keene terminal and it seemed a metaphor for hope, representing to me that Americans do — in an emergency — pull it together. Perhaps we grouse and gripe all the way — we’re a cantankerous, mouthy, opinionated bunch — but we put our shoulders to the wheel when we finally realize there’s an emergency at hand; we naturally form a pretty good bucket brigade.
 Maybe there’s something to that old expression that it’s darkest just before the dawn. Perhaps when people sit down to their Thanksgiving meal — modest as it might be this year — they’ll say a prayer and hope for the best. Hope is the salve that makes life tolerable, the candle in the window on a dark, windy, frigid night, soothing to the frayed nerves as you approach home, weary and sad. I think we’ll be seeing many candles in windows this year.
 I’ll end sounding like maybe I write cards for Hallmark. A mask can’t hide a smile, all expressions are conveyed through the eyes anyway. Let the other guy get that open parking space at the grocery store. Don’t feel it’s always necessary to expound upon the self-proclaimed righteousness of your political opinion. Call that lonely old lady down the street — the one you don’t necessarily like — and ask if she needs anything when you’re going to the store.
 You don’t have to turn into a relentless, Positive Polly — no one likes those people — but just crowbar your actions into a semblance of kindness and cheer, even if you don’t really feel it deep down inside. Light that candle in your soul.

And he did just that, even with his coach limiting his offensive production because, with Keene’s regional schedule, they were competing against schools in lower divisions.
 Behind O’Mara, the team finished undefeated in the regular season, and was scheduled to face Concord High School in the first round of the NHIAA DI tournament before their season prematurely ended because of travel restrictions.
 Regardless, O’Mara’s successful season earned him a spot on the All-State First Team.
 “It’s nice to be recognized as one of the better players in New Hampshire but compared to missing playoffs — it kind of makes up for it, but not totally,” O’Mara said. “I wish our team could’ve been recognized.”
 “That was a very attainable goal for him. I’m glad he reached it,” Pierce said. “These players had every excuse not to go as hard as they went … but these players … had goals in mind that they wanted to reach.
 “Being an All-State player is a big deal,” Pierce added.
 When O’Mara isn’t too busy scoring goals, he spends his free time improving himself off the field — or helping to improve others.
 This past February, O’Mara was part of a group of roughly 30 local high schoolers to travel to Puerto Rico with the Interact Club and spending a week on a missions trip helping the locals recover from damages caused by natural disasters.
 While on the trip, O’Mara and his group worked on home improvements as well as replanting trees in the area.
 “I remember the last day, when we were finishing up the house, we were getting on the bus to leave and, right before that we had walked around the house, and it felt fulfilling to see the difference,” O’Mara said.
 “Fulfilling” was the word that O’Mara used most when describing the trip to Puerto Rico. He hopes to go again this February, but the status of that trip is in question because of the pandemic.

I got the call on a Tuesday that my COVID-19 test came back positive, and my mind raced to two places: my kids and my heart.
 My kids because I feared they, too, were infected. (How could they not be? I work from home, they school from home. Laughing, singing cheek-to-cheek dance parties are standard in our kitchen.)
 My heart because I already have a heart condition brought on by a virus. I had viral meningitis in 2011 and, a cardiologist surmised, my body sent fluid to my organs to protect them. The sac of fluid near my heart never reabsorbed, so I live with a pericardial effusion that has neither shrunk nor grown in the past 9 years.

Bloomberg) -- The holiday travel rebound U.S. airlines were anticipating is starting to wobble.Surging coronavirus cases have caused a “weakening” in bookings, American Airlines Group Inc. President Robert Isom said Thursday at a Skift conference. Earlier in the day, United Airlines Holdings Inc. followed Southwest Airlines Co. in warning that more customers are scrapping their trips.
 “There has been a deceleration in system bookings and an uptick in cancellations as a result of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases,’ United said in a regulatory filing.The slowdown threatens airlines’ push for a modest holiday sales boost at the end of a year in which air travel collapsed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Only two weeks ago, United was adding flights for the week of Thanksgiving, saying it expected its busiest week since March. Now, government leaders are discouraging travel, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control being the latest to urge Americans to stay home.
 The CDC’s guidance Thursday came a day after Anthony Fauci, the influential director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recommended that people “think twice” about traveling over the holidays. That sets up the potential for increased tension between public health officials and the nation’s battered airlines.
 “We believe that renewed restrictions by many state and local governments have negatively impacted demand in the immediate term,” Alaska Air Group Inc. said in a filing.
 A Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. airlines was little changed at 1:18 pm. in New York. Southwest advanced 0.6% to $45.88 for the biggest gain while United fell the most with a 1% decline to $40.64.
 The U.S. reported an additional 163,975 cases on Wednesday, according to Covid Tracking Project data. There have been more than 250,000 deaths cumulatively, according to Johns Hopkins University.
 “We’ve already seen a seasonal uptick in cases, and that’s concerning,” Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said on a conference call. “Cancellations are up, but it looks like December will be in line with what we’re seeing in November, and maybe slightly improved.”

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A federal appeals court struck down Boca Raton’s ban on conversion therapy for gay adolescents struggling to come to terms with their sexuality, calling the ban an infringement on the First Amendment rights of the teens and the counselors who try to treat them.
 Licensed family therapists Robert Otto and Judy Hamilton sued the city for the right to talk to their juvenile clients about conversion if the clients had “unwanted” attraction to members of the same gender or “confusion” about their gender identity.
 The city’s ordinance prohibited conversion therapy as harmful to the health and emotional development of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and other youth. A district court upheld the law, but Otto and Hamilton appealed, backed by religious-liberty advocates at Liberty Counsel.
 A three-judge panel at the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned the earlier decision by a 2-1 vote. “We understand and appreciate that the therapy is highly controversial,” wrote Judge Britt Grant. “But the First Amendment has no carveout for controversial speech. We hold that the challenged ordinances violate the First Amendment because they are content- based regulations of speech that cannot survive strict scrutiny.”

If you've purchased a frozen turkey in advance, the best way to thaw a turkey is in the fridge. This ensures the turkey is being thawed at the same rate on the inside and outside. Of course, this takes a little planning ahead of time. The general rule of thumb is to allow 24 hours per 5 pounds of meat, so it would take a 20-pound turkey at least four days to thaw. Keep turkey in original packaging and place in a pan or on a try on the bottom shelf of fridge.

When we feel it is safe for our 4-H volunteers, members and their families, we have plans in place to offer a hybrid program and face-to-face programming again.

I live on Douglass Street and notice the frequency with which people leave things they no longer want on the corner of Douglass and Beaver streets on quite a regular basis. I’d often thought how good it is for someone to be able to leave something and have someone who might have a use for it take it off their hands.
 This year, though, it has developed into an eyesore. It seems to me that if the object is not taken after maybe two days, the person who left it needs to take it back and deal with it. This summer someone left a couch on the corner, which sat for literally weeks, even after it rained on it and then someone spray painted on it. The person or persons shamelessly passed by and let it sit there for literally weeks.
 Lately, there has been stuff sitting for a week or two, even after several rainfalls. I think it’s quite disrespectful to the neighborhood and wanted to comment on it.

"Humans are incredibly adaptable and resourceful, but there are limits to our ingenuity that we are starting to come to terms with. We see humans begin to migrate now across the landscapes as a result of climatic events. That's a very different type of migration than wildlife, but there are some similarities in how we both seek resources that benefit our lives."

I stumbled upon an article from January 2020 by author Brian Robinson, published in Forbes, called "10 Tips To Make 2020 Your Best Year Ever," and while Brian's crystal ball didn't tell him what a train wreck 2020 would be, his advice, nonetheless, was spot on because it was grounded in optimism.

Now that you have the statistics, let's make it personal. All of the complications from diabetes are preventable, which means that a person should never have to end up on dialysis, lose a foot, have a heart attack, a stroke or go blind, because of their diabetes. It does not have to happen.

The diva shared some throwback pics of her parents from their engagement ceremony along with some pics from their recent vacation. In the caption, Kriti showered immense love on her mom and dad and mentioned how they had restored her faith in happy endings.

Obama infamously joked about the supposedly joyless drone strikes during a well-remembered White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2010. The then-president jokingly threatened boyband the Jonas Brothers with assassination should they make a move on one of his daughters. "Boys, don't get any ideas," he said, "I have two words for you: predator drones."

I was amazed and grateful. I really believed I’d found a man who was so happy to have me in his life again that he’d stay with me through thick and thin. Wrong!
 During a talk about our childhood viral diseases, I made the excruciatingly difficult decision to tell him I had GH. His response was, “Oh, wow!” Then silence, followed by a change of subject. We hung up, and he has not called me or answered my calls since.

That led to involvement in larger projects and eventually the trip to the Dominican, after which they sponsored a child there. They had planned to visit West Africa this offseason to meet several of their other children before the pandemic canceled those plans for the time being.
