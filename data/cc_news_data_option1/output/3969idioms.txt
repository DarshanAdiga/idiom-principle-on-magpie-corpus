Democratic U.S. Senate contenders in Georgia rallied Saturday to hand out yard signs and push for consolidating the state’s left-leaning voter population ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
 Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, both Democrats vying to unseat Republican senators this election cycle, linked arms in the Atlanta suburb of Lithonia Saturday morning in one of a burgeoning number of in-person campaign events being held by top Democratic candidates amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Warnock, the senior pastor of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, has held mostly online video rallies and townhalls so far in his campaign against U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the Atlanta businesswoman who was appointed in December to hold the seat of retired U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson until November.
 But Saturday’s joint in-person appearance in Dekalb County by Warnock and Ossoff, the investigative journalist challenging U.S. Sen. David Perdue, signaled the two Democratic frontrunners are ready to engage more directly with voters in their respective Senate races roughly a month out from Election Day – and to do it wearing masks.
 “I think that the science is very clear that masks work,” Warnock said Saturday.
 “This virus is neither red or blue, Democrat or Republican,” Warnock continued. “It’s a virus. And the best thing we can do for one another – the most patriotic thing we can do – is put on a mask, socially distance, wash our hands and take care of our neighbors.”
 The several-dozen people in attendance handing out signs Saturday in support of Warnock and Ossoff all wore masks and conducted their activities outdoors, marking a contrast between Republican candidates and incumbents who have taken a more cavalier approach to masking.
 Loeffler, speaking with U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee at a Forsyth County restaurant Friday, stated she will not require masks to be worn among attendees at her campaign events despite the positive COVID-19 test results this week of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump.
 “I have had twenty-three Delta (Airlines) flights since May 4th,” Loeffler said Friday. “It is safe to be out and about if you take those precautions. And we should. We have to reopen the economy.”
 “The Democrats want to keep us locked down,” Loeffler continued. “We have to find ways to manage through this. I would just encourage Georgians to keep a level head and make sure they’re being cognizant of [health] guidelines.”
 Collins, the U.S. Air Force Reserve chaplain and Republican who is waging a fierce campaign against Loeffler for Georgia’s share of conservative votes, has also declined to require masks at his campaign events.
 “We encourage people to be safe in ways they are comfortable with,” said Collins campaign spokesman Dan McLagan.
 “Not being control-mad socialists, we are not big into requiring things,” McLagan added. “Be respectful of others, wear a mask if you wish, social distance.”
 The approaches between Democrat and Republican candidates on the campaign trail this election season have been starkly different, marked by an intense focus on safety guidelines by more liberal candidates like Ossoff and Warnock and a more assertive stance on personal choice espoused by conservatives like Loeffler, Collins and Perdue.
 Perdue, who like his Republican counterpart Loeffler tested negative for coronavirus Friday following news of Trump’s contraction, said he continues “to urge all Georgians to stay vigilant as we fight this virus.”
 “Remember to follow the three ‘W’s’: wash your hands, watch your distance and wear your mask!" Perdue wrote on Twitter Friday.
 The alliance of Ossoff’s campaign with fellow Democrat Warnock represents an unusual occurrence, given elections for Georgia’s two Senate seats normally occur in staggered years that do not overlap.
 But the start-of-the-year retirement by Isakson, a Republican, has thrust both Senate seats into play and partnered Warnock and Ossoff as the state’s Democratic party seeks to solidify support – and potentially help flip the balance of power in Congress.
 On Saturday, Ossoff pressed for less political divisiveness amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has crippled swaths of the economy and hounded Georgians who in many communities are venturing back out in public after more than six months of social isolation.
 “This should be a time for healing and unity,” Ossoff said Saturday. “And Reverend Warnock and I are united in the effort to unite the people to focus on what matters, which is our health, our well-being [and] our prosperity.”
 As of Friday afternoon, more than 320,000 people in Georgia had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel strain of coronavirus that sparked a global pandemic. It had killed 7,106 Georgians.
 Early voting in Georgia for the Nov. 3 elections starts on Oct. 12.

Prof Leslie Thomas QC, of London-based Garden Court Chambers, was recently appointed the first black Professor of Law at Gresham's College. He said experiences like those reported by Ms Wilson were nothing new.
 "You turn up at court, and you're seen as the defendant, the clerk, the solicitor...everything apart from the barrister. This has happened to me so many times.
 "On one occasion, I turned up to a case in my wig and suit and I was given such a hard time by the court's security guards.
 "I don't mind security giving anyone a hard time, if everyone gets a hard time. But that's not the case."
 He said he was pleased by Ms Wilson's stand against the issue, but said the reaction to her story "made me laugh".
 Prof Thomas said: "People need to wake up and smell the coffee. Being a white kid gives you privilege.
 "The perceptions of black people are so deep rooted [in society], it's not just the bar.
 "However, there are few workplaces that lack diversity more than the courts. There is unconscious bias.
 "One time, a judicial figure in this country said he was impressed by 'how articulate' I had been in court. I'm supposed to be articulate, I'm a barrister!"
 Prof Thomas said the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement had given him hope that racial bias was at a "turning point", but the question of "whether society can keep it up" remained to be seen.
 In an article for Counsel Magazine earlier this year, Prof Thomas wrote that "there are still no black male High Court judges".
 "Bias is implicit and often unconscious," he said. "It takes great courage to change the system."

“Under Operation Sting we have taking concrete steps to strengthen the logistics and operational capability of the civil and armed security forces.

In dynamic sites, the structure of a webpage — which includes items such as titles, bylines, article bodies, etc. — is abstracted into a template, and the specific data for each page is stored in a database. When requested by a web browser or other end client, a server-side language can then dynamically generate many different webpages with the same structure but different content. This is how frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django, as well as content management systems like WordPress, work.

A better place? I do not know, but this is what I like about PCLOS: It gives us access to state of the art software like the Gimp for photo editing, R for computations, Texlive for writing reports, Firefox and Thunderbird for staying connected, LibreOffice for occasional writing and drawing, Shotwell for organizing our photos, Skype for seeing the family and lots more. It has a forum that is nice to visit with helpful people from all over the world.
