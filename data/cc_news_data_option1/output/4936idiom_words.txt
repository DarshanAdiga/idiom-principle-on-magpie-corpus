 # Man arrested for calling in death threat from La Junta sentenced on Monday

 DENVER — A man arrested in 2018 for making a death threat from La Junta against the wife and child of a U.S. senator was sentenced Monday to "time served."
 Michael James Seaton "never intended to hurt anyone," a court document signed by a prosecutor states.
 Judge R. Brooke Jackson who presided over the case, said he agreed. The case was held in Denver at the U.S. District Court because Seaton was charged with a federal crime.
 The judge said Seaton served approximately 2 years in custody while waiting for resolution of the case. In court on Monday, Seaton, 61, pleaded guilty to "transmission of a threat through interstate commerce."
 The document said Seaton "made the threat out of frustration that he was unable to get anyone to take seriously concerns that he had tried to report to various authorities." It was signed by Seaton and his attorney, as well as the prosecutor.
 After Seaton was arrested, doctors testified he was delusional. He felt he had been wronged while living in Florida.
 The judge said Seaton was restored to competency by medication at a prison medical facility while in federal custody.
 Authorities did not identify the senator who was the recipient of the threat.
 Seaton was living in a motel and a trailer in or near La Junta around the time of the threat, according to information disclosed soon after he was arrested.
 Authorities listed Boynton Beach, Fla. as Seaton's address when the case was filed, but there was information that he also owned property in Otero or Bent counties.
