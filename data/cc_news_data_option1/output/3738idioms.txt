WASHINGTON (AP) — In a memo to U.S. attorneys Thursday obtained by The Associated Press, the Justice Department emphasized that federal prosecutors should aggressively go after demonstrators who cause violence — and even sedition charges could potentially apply.
 The sedition statute doesn’t require proof of a plot to overthrow the government, the memo read. It instead could be used when a defendant tries to oppose the government’s authority by force.
 Attorney General William Barr has been pushing his U.S. attorneys to bring federal charges in protest-related violence whenever they can, keeping a grip on cases even if a defendant could be tried instead in state court. Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences; sedition alone could lead to up to 20 years behind bars.

It has been quite a while since Google’s Nearby Sharing feature snuck its way into the Chromium repository. While Nearby Sharing hasn’t been live for Android users for very long, it looks like the Chrome OS team is hard at it getting the file-sharing feature working for Chromebooks. The Nearby Share flag popped up in the Canary channel of Chrome OS a few months ago. However, apart from Chrome Story somehow getting it to work back in July, the feature has been completely non-functioning. When enabled along with a “share sheet” flag, the sharing option in the Files app simply shows the Nearby Share icon. Clicking the icon launched a dummy placeholder screen. My guess is that developers did not intend for the feature to ever show up for the general public. When Chrome Story’s Dinsan Francis was able to get it working, I presume the Chromium team slammed the door.

Champions Bayern Munich kicked off the new Bundesliga season on Friday at home to Schalke behind closed doors as Germany winger Leroy Sane made his debut for the hosts.
 The 24-year-old Sane made his first appearance since his July transfer from Manchester City.
 Austria defender David Alaba, who is stalling over signing a contract extension with a year left on his current deal, missed out with a leg injury.
 Following Thiago Alcantara's transfer to Liverpool on Friday, his place in Bayern's central midfield was filled by Joshua Kimmich.
 The European champions were forced to keep the stands at Munich's Allianz Arena empty because of a rising coronavirus infection rate in the Bavarian capital.
 However, fans are expected at other top-flight grounds on the opening weekend of the new German league season.
 On Thursday, Munich's mayor Dieter Reiter decided that Bayern fans must stay away, scuppering plans to allow 7,500 home supporters into the Allianz Arena.
 "I am sad that it is not possible to play the Bundesliga opener in front of spectators," said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.
 "It remains our wish and our goal to be able to play in front of our fans again as soon as possible."
 Germany's politicians had given Bundesliga clubs the green light to allow the partial return of fans into stadiums, providing the rate of infection in each region remains below 35 per 100,000 inhabitants.
 Bayern's hygiene concept, to allow fans into the stadium, had been approved as late as Wednesday night.
 However, the rate of infection figure for Munich was revised to 47.6 per 100,000 on Thursday, which led to Reiter's decision.
 Set numbers of fans are expected at other Bundesliga grounds this weekend.
 The largest crowd is expected in Dortmund where last season's runners-up expect "around 10,000 fans" for Saturday evening's match against fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach.

Smoke from California and Oregon wildfires has cloaked Canada's third-largest city of Vancouver -- known for its majestic mountain views and fresh ocean breezes -- in the dirtiest air in the world this week.
 Days have been spent smarting under a thick haze that has irritated eyes and throats, and sent asthmatics gasping for breath. It has also complicated Covid-19 testing.
 On Friday, despite forecasted smoke-clearing rain storms, the city -- 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) north of the biggest California fires -- topped for the second time this week the World Air Quality Index for worst air, after briefly ceding first place to Portland in fire-stricken Oregon.
 "I'm out of breath all the time, my chest feels like it's exploding, I feel like I'm going to suffocate," Fatima Jaffer, a doctoral student at the University of British Columbia, told AFP.
 "I'm afraid of the long-term damage this smoke might do to my lungs and my asthma."
 Authorities for the metropolitan region of 2.5 million residents issued daily air quality warnings since September 8, with things so bad that Vancouver opened five filtered "clean air shelters."
 It's equivalent to smoking eight cigarettes a day, researchers noted. Health officials urged all citizens to close windows and avoid strenuous exercise or outdoor activities -— especially those with respiratory illness.
 Jaffer, 58, said her worsening asthma added to a sense of panic and dread, as she had just recovered from Covid-19, which robbed her of her sense of smell. Now she worries the smog could increase her odds of reinfection or cause new health complications.
 "I'd just gotten to the place of getting over the fear of Covid-19 and felt like I could breathe again," she said, "and now I literally can't."
 It's been an "entire horrible week for air quality," said Armel Castellan, a federal warning preparedness meteorologist. "The fine particulate has brought our Air Quality Health Index up off the charts."
 "There's no doubt this is very massive and very concerning," he said.
 \- Covid-19 and wildfire smoke -
 The same people are at most risk of smoke inhalation and the coronavirus, according to provincial health officer Bonnie Henry. The past month has seen British Columbia's active Covid-19 cases surge 130 percent, hitting highs more than double those at the pandemic's April peak.
 "For many of us, there's confusion about what symptoms are caused by smoky skies, and what symptoms are caused by Covid-19," Henry told a news conference, "particularly for people who have underlying lung disease, asthma, heart disease and diabetes."
 Another vulnerable group are Vancouver's more than 2,000 homeless residents, many of whom have chronic illness, a recent survey found.
 "If you're outside and homeless, and surrounded by this smoke and the pandemic, you can't get away from any of these things," said Jeremy Hunka, with Union Gospel Mission. "It's hitting a group of people that generally have been just left far more vulnerable."
 For North Vancouver professional dog-walker Barry Appal, 64, he and his wife ten years his senior have had to wear masks outdoors and avoid usual strenuous trails.
 "After a half-hour you could feel it in your lungs and get a headache," he said. "We're active and healthy, but with Covid-19 around, picking up any respiratory thing could become a bigger problem than normal."
 He's most worried for his 30-something nephew with cystic fibrosis.
 "He's very susceptible to anything to do with his lungs," Appal said. "He's already freaked out about Covid -- that could wipe him right out at the drop of a hat."
 Meteorologist Castellan said conditions should improve next week thanks to brewing Pacific storms clearing the air.
 But with the "fingerprints of climate change" clearly visible in the year- after-year worsening wildfire seasons, "We're not done with this yet," he warned.

The Big Ten, along with the Pac-12, Mountain West and Mid-American Conference, initially postponed all fall sports and set tentative plans to play those seasons in the spring. The Big Ten reversed course Wednesday, however, and announced a return to play plan that will see its 14 members begin competition Oct. 24.
 In its press release, the Big Ten cited rapid, daily testing as one of the keys to university presidents changing their minds on the initial dangers that led them to the postponement.
 Following Burman’s address to the Board of Trustees, UW president Edward Seidel released a statement on the potential return of fall sports, saying he was optimistic they could be put back in place.
 “Due to recent advances in COVID-19 testing technology, and in light of the decision by the Big Ten Conference to return to competition in October, I am hopeful that we will find a safe path forward to get our athletics program back in business,” Seidel said in a news release. “It was terribly disappointing for all of us — especially those players and coaches, but also our amazing fans — that a postponement of the fall season was determined to be necessary. Our athletics director, Tom Burman, and our department of athletics are working hard with their colleagues to bring the postponement to an end for the Cowboys and Cowgirls. We’re not able to announce anything right now, but be assured that we’re doing everything we can to make it happen.”
 While football is at the forefront of most people’s minds, Burman noted that all athletes would have equal access to the hypothetical testing. When asked by a board member the odds of there being football sometime this academic year, Burman said chances were “very high” and that, “it could happen sooner.”
 “Testing is the issue for returning to play, and it has to be rapid, frequent testing,” Burman said. “That’s not simple nor cheap.”

In the video, taken from a Fox News report, Biden points to his right and waves as he steps from the plane in Tampa, but only an empty field can be seen in the distance.

One version of the video was retweeted more than 17,000 times. Versions of the same video also appeared on YouTube and various conservative blogs, and were viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook. In reality, Biden was waving to people outside the frame of the video. Beyond the AP's account, a Bloomberg News reporter posted video of the scene from a different angle, capturing four people standing near a fire truck and other personnel on the runway.

SPRINGFIELD - Gov. JB Pritzker said Wednesday that he stands behind his decision to prohibit high school football for the fall season amid the COVID-19 pandemic, even as professional and many college leagues have decided to resume play.
   
 "Over the summer, we saw outbreaks across Illinois and the world tied to a variety of youth sports leagues. Those continue today, even among the lowest risk youth sports," Pritzker said during a COVID-19 news conference in Chicago. "We have watched professional sports and even some college teams play seemingly without many problems. But remember that these programs are operating with daily testing or in a league-created bubble, or with facilities that allow for outsized social distancing and are sanitized every day. And, in some cases, all of those precautions have been taken."
   
 Pritzker's comments came one day after the Big 10 conference, which includes the University of Illinois and Northwestern University, reversed its earlier decision and announced that it will allow the 2020 football season to go forward starting Oct. 23-24 under enhanced health and safety protocols.
   
 The NFL also has allowed its season to go forward under safety protocols that include limited seating in the stadiums.
   
 The Illinois Department of Public Health released its sports safety guidelines in July. Those guidelines divide various sports into three risk categories, depending on the level of physical contact involved, among other factors.
   
 Football and hockey are in the highest risk category, meaning those teams are restricted to non-contact training. Basketball and soccer are considered medium risk, meaning they can have intra-team scrimmages but no competitive play. Baseball, golf and softball are considered low risk so they are allowed to engage in competitive games.
   
 Football has been pushed back to the spring, along with boys soccer and girls volleyball. The only high school sports currently ongoing are cross country, golf, girls tennis and girls swimming and diving.
   
 "The science is the same for sports as it is for restaurants, meetings, nursing homes, you name the situation," IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said. "The more people you are around, the closer you are to them, and the longer you are around them, the greater the risk of transmitting COVID-19, and this includes colleges and universities."
   
 Dr. Michael Lin, an infectious disease specialist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, said that regardless of the level of contact involved in any particular sport, all contact sports present some level of risk.
   
 "While a contact sport itself provides an easy way on the field for the virus to spread, it is also incredibly important to remember that there are many off-the-field activities that are associated with contact sports, such as athletes using locker rooms, working out in gyms, and traveling together that provide a perfect storm of conditions."
   
 Declining infection rates
   
 The debate over the resumption of high school sports came as infection rates appeared to be declining in most parts of Illinois, including two regions that are currently under enhanced mitigation measures such as the closing of bars and restaurants to indoor service.
   
 In Region 7, which includes Will and Kankakee counties, the rolling average test positivity rate fell to 6.4 percent, according to the latest data. That's a tenth of a point below the 6.5-percent benchmark that would allow for the lifting of those restrictions.
   
 "IDPH will continue to watch that positivity over the next few days, and if that trend holds for three days, we will remove the resurgence mitigations and return the entire region to Phase Four of the Restore Illinois plan," Pritzker said.
   
 In Region 4, which includes the Metro East area across the river from St. Louis, the rolling average test positivity rate stood at 8.9 percent. That's still above the 8-percent threshold that triggers the enhanced mitigation efforts, but well below the 9.6-percent rate the area recorded just three days earlier.
   
 Pritzker noted that the positivity rate has held steady or declined in all but two regions of Illinois over the past two weeks. The statewide positivity rate stood at 3.7 percent as of Wednesday, an increase of one-tenth of a percent from the day prior.
   
 On Wednesday, IDPH reported 1,941 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 over the previous 24 hours, bringing the statewide total since the pandemic began to 266,151. The department also reported an additional 35 virus-related fatalities, bringing the statewide death toll to 8,367.
   
 As of Tuesday night, 1,565 people in Illinois were being hospitalized for COVID-19. That included 345 patients in intensive care units, of whom 143 were on ventilators.

ROCK HILL, S.C. -- On Friday, the South Atlantic Conference Presidents Council has made the decision to begin intercollegiate competition in men's and women's basketball for the 2020-21 season on November 21. Teams will also be permitted to begin full team practices on Oct. 22. The start date of other winter sports (indoor track and field, swimming and diving and wrestling) will be up to each institution's discretion.
 "While we realize we are not out of the woods completely, the pandemic situation has improved and we feel confident in our abilities to allow our student-athletes to compete in a safe environment," said Dr. Maurice Scherrens of Newberry, Chair of the SAC Presidents Council. "Starting basketball will be a good opportunity for us as a league to test out our protocols and procedures to make sure we are fully prepared for fall, winter, and spring sports to be played during the 2021 spring semester."

Then here was a school that was dedicated to not only giving them a voice that is heard, but giving them control over how their school is run, how the daily life of the school unfolds is determined by the students at St. Benedict's. So you are handing the students the reins, to a large degree, in their own lives, and that's something that young people rarely get anywhere and young people of color never get. I sensed that would be sort of just fascinating to examine, but how that would happen once they go inside the gym doors, because a sports team is a place where the individual voice has to be sublimated to the collective good. This was going to be a challenge to say the least. It was going to be a conflict more than likely, and sure enough, that's what happened.

It is not clear whether protest-related arrests will continue apace. Demonstrations have slowed, though not necessarily because of the federal charges. Wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have lessened some of the conflict.
 While many local prosecutors have dismissed dozens of low-level protest arrests, some are still coming down hard. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1 million for about a dozen people in a protest that followed the death of a knife-wielding man by police.
 Even some Democrats, including District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, have called for the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against violent demonstrators, going as far as accusing the administration of declining to prosecute rioters. Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 42 people one August weekend after a protest left a trail of vandalism. But prosecutors said the arrest paperwork did not identify specific crimes tied to each suspect.
 The federal confrontation with Bowser seemed counterintuitive, though Trump has a history of squaring off against the mayor.
 About one-third of the federal protest-related cases are in Portland, for crimes such as assaulting a deputy U.S. marshal with a baseball bat, setting fires and setting off explosives at the federal courthouse and throwing rocks at officers.
 Three purported “Boogaloo” members, who use the loose movement’s name as a slang term for a second civil war or collapse of civilization, were charged with possessing a homemade bomb and inciting a riot in Las Vegas.
 An El Paso, Texas, man was accused of promoting hate speech, posting a video online with a racist epithet and making threatening comments to Black Lives Matter protesters while holding a military-style rifle at his feet. A Minnesota man was accused of helping burn down a police precinct headquarters there after Floyd’s death.
 But other cases simply do not belong in federal court, lawyers say.
 In Seattle, 35-year-old Isaiah Willoughby, who’s accused of setting fire to the outside of a police precinct, faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison if convicted of arson in federal court. He could be looking at about a year behind bars in state court, where his lawyer said the case belongs.
 “This is city property that has been destroyed and you have a local prosecutors office that is ready and willing and able to charge these cases in state court, but the federal government is attempting to emphasize these protest-related crimes for whatever agenda they are seeking to pursue,” said assistant federal public defender Dennis Carroll.
 Carroll accused federal authorities of using the cases to try to make the protests seem more violent and disruptive than they really were.
 Federal prosecutors this month agreed to dismiss the charge against a man who authorities said was found with a Molotov cocktail in his backpack after he and other protesters were arrested in May for blocking traffic in Jacksonville, Florida. Video showed that 27-year-old Ivan Zecher was wrongfully arrested because he was actually on the sidewalk — not in the street — meaning prosecutors could not pursue their case, Zecher’s attorney, Marcus Barnett said.
 “There is absolutely an agenda here to blow these out of proportion, make these look more serious or more sinister than it is,” Barnett said of the pursuit of federal charges. “This is the Justice Department, from the top, furthering an agenda that has nothing to do with justice,” he said.

We went out in August to shoot a couple of days at the end of what's their summer session. It just blew my mind between Father Ed, this radical old monk who came out of the '60s all full of fire and piss and vinegar, and the kids were so interesting and so diverse. You had the African kids, you had the Newark kids, you had the suburban kids, and yet they're so incredibly talented. They were just so interesting to me, the kids. You work with kids sometimes and they're shy and you're just an old guy and they're not too comfortable around you, but these young men were incredibly self-possessed and had a way of dealing with one another and a way of being on camera that was just really compelling and the energy in the school was extraordinary. We knew we had a great project on our hands after those two days and cut together some footage that we'd shot and took it around and happy to find a home with Quibi.

“You can tell the guys are ready,” he said. “The urgency has elevated; they know they’re in the single digits right now until kickoff time so you can sense it.”
 There has been a fair amount of raving done by coaches and the media about the potential of White’s unit. Given its 2019 achievements and the abundance of returning bodies, it’s understandable. That said, he doesn’t want that getting in his players’ minds. He wants to keep them motivated and ready to prove themselves again.
 “There’s definitely a pride piece to it,” White said. “I think anyone that’s a competitor has that pride piece. We also know that year’s past.”
 “We’re a different team… every year is different, and every year you have to face new adversity and new challenges. Just because you look good on paper doesn’t mean you’re going to rise to those challenges and elevate,” he continued. “I think we have the guys to do it, but you never know exactly how it’s going to play out until it happens.”

The Plainsmen (1-2) will look to even their record with the third early road game of the schedule with a trip over the hill to take on No. 4 Cheyenne East (2-1) at 6 p.m. today at Okie Blanchard Stadium.
 Laramie will also be a bit shorthanded without seniors Colter Nunn at running back and Garrett Dodd at receiver. Reed said both were “banged up” and “Other guys have to step up and we will go with the horses we have.”
 One of those horses has been senior running back Isaac Sell, who leads LHS with 149.3 all-purpose yards per game — 117.7 rushing, 26.3 receiving and 5.3 on kickoff returns. At running back, he has 353 total yards on 56 carries to go with four touchdowns. His rushing total ranks fourth in Class 4A.
 The Plainsmen defense will have to contend with the best offensive team in 4A, led by the best quarterback.
 The Thunderbirds have accounted for an average of 458 yards, led by the passing attack of senior Graedyn Buell. His stats so far are: 311.3 yards through the air; 58 of 89 for 65.2% completions; 10 touchdowns and one interception. His quarterback efficiency rating is 188.2.
 “(East) has a good quarterback who is leading everybody else in the state,” Reed said. “I don’t think you can necessarily stop him from scoring. We will need to put up some points so we can play in this game and get after it. It has to be a little bit of a shootout.”

The Kewanee resident holding up a planned 123-acre solar farm on the western city limits says he's fighting the project not because of its encroachment to his property, but because he wants to protect the city from an imminent Chinese attack on the U.S. power grid.
   
 Kewanee Planning Commission members postponed the approval of a special-use permit for the project at last month's hearing after resident Robert Turner, whose property abuts a solar farm being developed by California-based Sunpin Solar, claimed the company had not lived up to its deal to mitigate the effect of the solar panels on his property.
   
 Turner claims the company had agreed to plant trees around the property he purchased three years ago - bought around the time the company was negotiating a deal with the Kewanee Economic Development Corporation over the purchase of the solar farm land. The land sits on the KEDC's Leninger Industrial Park through an option lease agreement that was signed in 2019.
   
 The Lininger site would be host to an approximate 25 megawatt solar system with an estimated annual production of up to 46,100 megawatt-hours. The total annual production could power 3,900 homes annually.
   
 Sunpin's alleged deal with Turner was supposed to serve as a buffer between the solar farm and the residential property.
   
 "I don't want to live in the middle of it, that's what the objection is," he told commissioners at August's online meeting.
   
 The 80-year-old Turner complained to commissioners that Sunpin officials hadn't dealt with him fairly and that the two sides had yet to reach an agreement. He also complained that the KEDC had not treated him fairly or taken his concerns seriously, and by keeping the deal a secret, he hadn't been aware of the planned solar farm when he purchased his property.
   
 Sunpin business development manager Jamie Boyd confirmed that the company initially had offered $15,000 to Turner for the landscaping work, but told planning commissioner members in the Zoom meeting that the company was prepared to make Turner a final $25,000 for the tree-planting work.
   
 Commissioners tabled the matter until its Sept. 25 meeting, awaiting the company's final offer to Turner.
   
 Change in tune
   
 But Turner says now he won't accept the offer -- or any offer -- telling the Star Courier that his demand from Sunpin has gone up to $220,000 to purchase the property entirely (plus moving expenses) and that he never really cared whether the company provided a barrier of trees around his property.
   
 "I want to do what's right for the people of Kewanee and the citizens of the United States," he said in a phone interview. "I think we have a violation of national security going on. I'm not worried about the surroundings here, that's crap."
   
 Instead, he is calling on the city to reject Sunpin's special-use permit request until next year because he claims the components within the proposed solar farm could be used by the Chinese government to unleash an attack on the country's power grid. He has provided city leaders information packets he says prove his theories.
   
 "Last night one of my sources told me that serious decisions are being made by government agencies between now and the election, dealing with the national grid threat," he said in a followup email. "From this information, I strongly suggest that the city council wait until after January 2021 to vote on the Sunpin matter, to pass a vote any sooner it is most likely that the 'powers to be' could loose their entire investments."
   
 Tuners claims "connections" to officials in China that were made through the course of his professional career.
   
 City nonplussed
   
 Kewanee Mayor Gary Moore is disputing Turner's conspiratorial claims and what he says are racist characterizations in his arguments that have offended Sunpin company officials.
   
 "The were very offended by his racially motivated attacks," he said.
   
 In fact, despite Sunpin's project being tabled to September, company officials have asked to skip the Sept. 24 meeting and to have their item placed on October's agenda instead.
   
 In the interim, Moore has set up a meeting with Sunpin officials to ameliorate hard feelings over Turner's attacks and to reaffirm the city's commitment to the project, which is expected to produce additional revenue to the city, though no specific revenue projections have yet been shared publicly.
   
 The Planning Commission's final recommendation would still need city council approval.
   
 "They don't need anything from him," the mayor said, noting that the offer of landscaping was beyond what was required of Sunpin and a sign they were trying to be good neighbors.
   
 Despite Turner's bluster, "We're still planning to move forward," Moore said.
   
 Keith Edwards, Kewanee's director of community development, who doesn't have a vote in the special-use approval process but received an information packet from Turner, said he is dumbstruck over the residet's efforts to stymy the deal with Sunpin.
   
 "The city is absolutely welcoming them with open arms," he said. "We support the whole concept."
   
 Edwards said it's ironic that zoning for Leninger Industrial Park, where the solar panels will be moored underground to withstand 110 mph winds, actually allows for more-intrusive industry to build there. He said Sunpin is not obligated to provide any kind of barrier, and that a factory would be exempted from special-use requirements but be required to put up an 8-foot fence.
   
 The city council approved a solar ordinance last year and the special-use provision was added to give the city another project oversight mechanism.
   
 "That land is zoned manufacturing, so if a large factory built here -- let's say John Deere wanted to build tractors there, if we were to be so lucky -- it would be way more obstructive to him than a solar array."
   
 In the end, only the panels will be visible, as installation doesn't involve intricate footings, only a concrete pad. The whole operation could be removed and the property's configuration would remain unchanged.
   
 "It leaves no footprint on the ground, whatsoever," Edwards said.
   
 He said he hopes company officials can see past Turner's bluster and know that Kewanee is a welcoming place for development.
   
 "It would be a very sad thing if one person were able to make this go away," he said.
   
 Turner, who describes his fight as part a part of his a Christian Constitutionalist beliefs, said that won't stop him from trying.
   
 "I want them to turn it down, that's the right way to do it," Turner said in the phone interview. "I will never let this go. I'd like to prevent this from even happening. I'm not a lawsuit man, but…"
