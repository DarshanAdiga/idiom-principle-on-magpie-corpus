Relying this much on close wins is a good way to fly far too close to the sun. Of course, close wins are kind of Juve's thing.
 The best close-game average over the past decade came from Juventus in 2013-14. They played in 18 zero- or one-goal matches, won 15 and drew the other three. This almost impossible 2.67-point average prompted their run to a league-record 102 points and a 17-point romp over an excellent Roma. They won the league comfortably the next year thanks to Roma's regression, but their close-game average fell to 1.83, and their overall point total fell to 85.
 The fifth team to top 2.2 points per zero- or one-goal matches? Last year's Juve. They averaged 2.29. Death, taxes, Juve scoring late goals to steal points.
 ## The (increasingly) Old Lady
 Back in April, I took a look at how some of Europe's established elite teams were positioned for the future. The main takeaway for Juve: they're old. Very good, but old.
 Those 14 players with 1,000 league minutes? Nine are at least 29 years old. Ronaldo is 35, defender Leonardo Bonucci and midfielder Blaise Matuidi 33, Higuain and defender Juan Cuadrado 32\. This was one of the oldest core rosters in the Big Five and while Juve is usually a bit on the mature side, this is pushing it.
 There is a small but impressive young core of players like Dybala (26), de Ligt (20) and midfielders Rodrigo Bentancur (23) and Adrien Rabiot (25) in the rotation, and even though there weren't many homegrown players on the pitch this year, Juve does have star prospects like winger Dejan Kulusevski, forwards Dany Mota and Felix Correia, defenders Merih Demiral, Luca Pellegrini and Cristian Romero, and keeper Leonardo Loria on whom to call at some point.
 It will be fascinating to see how Sarri attempts to integrate youth while keeping the title streak alive. It's easier said than done, and it might open the door to another interesting title race next year.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — With three days to go before the 2020 opener, Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw already was reveling in the first victory of the season.
 How he performs Thursday night against the San Francisco Giants in his ninth opening day assignment remains up in the air. But just the opportunity to begin preparations for the Dodgers’ biggest rival has Kershaw feeling positive.
 “Really, the fact that we’re even here, a few days away from having a season, I think is a win for baseball in and of itself,” Kershaw said Monday, remarking on the low percentage of positive COVID-19 tests around the majors.
 Of course, the biggest challenges posed by the coronavirus await. Teams are only now starting to hit the road for exhibition games. Los Angeles hosted the Arizona Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium on Monday for the second consecutive night.
 Simply breaking even in road games has always been a solid recipe for success in baseball. Except now, Kershaw believes that being away from home is where the entire season will hang in the balance.
 “Honestly, it’s just kind of scary,” the three-time Cy Young Award winner said. “You think about, if I go somewhere and get (coronavirus) and give it to my teammates and our season is ruined because of something stupid I did, that’s a bad feeling. Don’t be that guy.

Understeer is the predominant handling character, as expected of a car with two-thirds of its mass over the front axle, but you really need to either carry too much speed into a turn or get on the throttle too early – the mid- corner behavior is very neutral, and I could dial in additional steering as needed.

Play ball? Experts send mixed signals on MLB 60-game season

Lakers coach Frank Vogel has seen playoff-season James three times before — never liking how those experiences went. Vogel was coaching Indiana and his three best seasons there saw the Pacers matched up with James and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference playoffs.
 Heat in 6 in 2012. Heat in 7 in 2013. Heat in 6 in 2014.
 This time, Vogel is genuinely and understandably eager to see James at playoff time.
 “Obviously, it’s been great having LeBron on our side after years of going against him,” Vogel said. “But in particular, when we get to the playoff environment, I’ve just seen how he is this year in some of the bigger regular season games, how he’s more mentally locked in, more vocal, more making sure everybody else is locked in. And I anticipate that come playoff time, we’ll see that all being done at an enhanced level.”
 James will have a big say in whether the Lakers win that title. By the time the season resumes July 30, the ballots will be cast to determine whether he or Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo — the two frontrunners — wins the NBA MVP award. James is almost mathematically assured of winning his first assist title; he cannot be caught by second-place Trae Young of Atlanta no matter what happens at Disney. And the Lakers, barring all-out collapse, will be the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference.
 By any measure, it’s been a good year on the court for James.
 A weird year, but a good year. Time will tell if it’s a great year. He believes the bubble will work and sees no reason yet why this NBA experiment would fail. And while he detests being away from his family and his inner circle, he’s using this chance to be locked in to focus on the opportunity.
 “As far as the MVP race, I think I’ve shown what I’m capable of doing, not only individually but from a team’s perspective, us being No. 1 in the West,” James said. “There was a lot of conversation about, you know, ‘LeBron can do those things in the East but if he ever came to the West, what can he do?’ I heard all of that, and to have our team at the top of the Western Conference and playing the way that we were playing at that time and the way I was playing, you know, that’s definitely a good feeling.”
 NOTES: The league said 346 players had been tested on the NBA campus since last leaguewide coronavirus results were announced July 13, with no positives. … Houston coach Mike D’Antoni said guard Russell Westbrook, who revealed last week that he tested positive for coronavirus, was flying in Monday and rejoining the team. “I know he’ll be ready,” D’Antoni said. … Sacramento announced that Marvin Bagley III was having an MRI to determine how badly he injured his right foot in practice Sunday. The Kings will be without De’Aaron Fox (ankle), Richaun Holmes (extended quarantine for rules violation) and Alex Len (coronavirus, returned to practice Monday) for their exhibition opener against Miami on Wednesday. Harrison Barnes (coronavirus) is also still away from the team and Bagley’s status seems most unclear now as well.

Other Trump aides have for months pushed the president to keep a lower profile on the virus response and instead champion the economic recovery and other issues with a clearer political upside. That camp, led by chief of staff Mark Meadows, has attempted to plot out something close to a traditional messaging strategy for Trump to contrast him with Biden on policy issues.
 In the last week, they’ve organized White House events highlighting Trump’s efforts to support law enforcement, talk tough on China and roll back regulations, all while sharply criticizing Biden. And Trump himself has teased forthcoming moves on immigration and health care.
 Meadows was among the most forceful White House aides in pushing Trump to end the once-daily coronavirus briefings more than two months ago after the president mused about injecting disinfectants as a cure for the virus. It sparked state medical warnings against the potentially deadly move.
 The daily briefings were scrapped soon after that misstatement, fulfilling the hope of aides who saw them dragging down the president’s poll numbers, particularly with older voters.
 But the president himself had not abandoned the idea of reviving them in some form, telling aides he missed the early evening window in which he would dominate cable television ratings. Tellingly, when he announced Monday that the news conferences could return, he did so with an eye toward its time slot.
 The view in Trump’s circle is that the president needs an alternate means to reach voters with his trademark rallies largely on hold because of the coronavirus. The president voiced frustration in recent days about his inability to hold a rally, blaming Democratic governors in battleground states for not waiving COVID-19 restrictions on large gatherings.

New York-based audio gear maker Avantone Pro has released a pair of heavy- looking reference-grade headphones for musicians, engineers, podcasters and audiophiles on a budget. But the Planar over-ears have been designed for long session comfort and, as the name suggests, feature planar magnetic driver technology for the promise of "amazing accuracy, high-end detail, clarity, natural bass and response time."
 Planar drivers sit somewhere between dynamic and electrostatic technology, where a super-thin, electrostatic-style flexible diaphragm is set between an array of evenly-spaced Neodymium magnets. Avantone says that since the magnets apply equal forces front and rear, the resulting sound is more natural than would be delivered using moving coil drivers, with low distortion and fast response times.
 The open backs create a flat frequency curve over a wide 30 Hz to 30 kHz range, with total harmonic distortion of less than 0.1 percent at 100 dB, 104-dB sensitivity and 32-ohm impedance. All without the kind of pressure build up or acoustic resonance you might get from closed back models.
 All in, this should result in less listening fatigue and, though the headphones look big and bulky, Avantone says that "sessions that last for hours will only feel like minutes" thanks to big soft ear cushions and a lightweight design – though they do tip the scales at exactly a pound (0.48 kg).
 The Planar headphones are available now in red or black, and come supplied with an eco-friendly shoulder bag, a long audio cable and a jack adapter for US$399.

“We have seen no evidence of successful interference in the EU Referendum,” the statement said.
 The report says Russia sees Britain as one of its top intelligence targets in the West. It said Russian influence in the U.K. is the “new normal,” and successive governments have welcomed Russian oligarchs with open arms. Russians with “very close links” to President Vladimir Putin were “well integrated into the U.K. business, political and social scene — in ‘Londongrad’ in particular," it said.
 Speaking before the report was released, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Russia “never interfered in electoral processes,"not in the United States, not in Britain, not in any other country."
 “We don’t do that ourselves and we don’t tolerate when other countries try to interfere with our political affairs,” Peskov said.
 The report's authors said they were subjected to an unprecedented delay in making the document public, with officials holding off its release for more than six months. Critics have claimed that was meant to shield Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party from embarrassment.
 The committee did not offer a theory as to why the government delayed the report, but did say the government’s explanations for delaying the report were not true.

After winning three World Series titles as a catcher with the Yankees, Girardi began his managing career in 2006 with the Marlins, led the team to a 78-84 record and was fired — before he was voted NL Manager of the Year.
 He was hired by the Yankees after the 2007 season to replace Joe Torre, managed New York to its 27th title in 2009 and was let go by the Yankees after the 2017 season. He decade-long record in New York was 910-710 but resulted in just one pennant.
 Girardi was hired by the Phillies during the offseason to replace Gabe Kapler and was reunited with shortstop Didi Gregorius, who left the Yankees and agreed to a $14 million, one-year deal.
 “He’s played extremely well, especially in this 2.0, as we call it,” Girardi said. “I think he’s grown really fond of his teammates and his teammates love him.”
 Gregorius spoke with old teammates before the game, then went 1 for 3 in the tie. He doubled and scored in the first off prospect Deivi Garcia and was replaced by another popular ex-New York player, Ronald Torreyes.
 Aaron Judge hit a fifth-inning home run off Vince Velasquez, a 428-field, opposite-field drive into the right-field seats for his third homer in two games since returning from a broken rib. Judge was unsure whether to circle the bases because he was allowed to bat with three outs — DJ LeMahieu had hit into an inning-ending double play but the Phillies wanted Velasquez to face one more batter.

 The news was particularly sweet for Grimm, who made at least 50 appearances for the Chicago Cubs every season from 2014 to 2017 but has bounced around a few organizations since and spent all of 2019 in the minors.
 “It was a long year last year,” Grimm said. “There were times I was ready to walk away from the game, just to be honest with you. But I’m just very fortunate that I have people around me who care, who helped me navigate those emotions."

 Zimmer's chance of emerging from a crowded outfield mix has been helped by Delino DeShields being slowed after contracting the coronavirus and Jordan Luplow's back issue.
 A first-round draft pick in 2014, Zimmer broke in with the Indians in 2017 and played 101 games. The 6-foot-5, 220-pounder was quickly nicknamed “Machine” by his teammates, who were awed by his speed on the bases and in the outfield gaps.
 But his bright future hit a serious nag in 2018, when a torn labrum in his right shoulder required surgery that would sideline Zimmer for nearly a year.
 He spent most of last season in Arizona rehabbing before being called up for nine games in September. When camp opened this past February, Zimmer was considered a long shot, at best, to make Cleveland's opening-day roster mainly because the team wanted to ease him back by getting him more playing time in the minors.
 The pandemic changed those plans, and Zimmer's performance so far this summer has forced the Indians to re-think their outfield alignment.

NEW YORK (AP) — Joe Girardi’s new path was evident Monday. And unfamiliar.
 So was the result.
 Girardi's Philadelphia Phillies tied the New York Yankees 2-2 Monday night in a preseason exhibition after Mauricio Llovera allowed a solo home run in the ninth to pinch hitter Mike Ford.
 A tie was not what he had envisioned.
 “That doesn’t happen in real baseball,” said Girardi, who started his day by watching a simulated intrasquad game. “But, obviously, we’ve got a long trip back, and we’ve had a long day of baseball.”
 About to start his first season as Philadelphia's manager, he was at Yankee Stadium for a prep ahead of his team’s pandemic-delayed opener Friday at home against Miami. He had been back just once since he was cut loose by the Yankees, for an appearance.
 “I always came in through the garage, down the stairs, into the home clubhouse,” he said. “We came through the loading dock and from center field all the way around. So that was different.”
 Not everything was a change.
 “I did see a lot of familiar faces in Lou Cucuzza and and his clubhouse staff,” he said, referring to New York’s director of clubhouse operations. “So that seemed kind of normal. But you’re on the opposite side, and it’s different.”

 “From the beginning when we set out we got more partners on board and everyone has just pulled together. We see ourselves as a partnership, getting people the correct information about the current situation and coming out of the crisis.

CAIRO (AP) — The coronavirus has infected people inside several Egyptian prisons and killed at least 14 detainees, as authorities seek to stifle news of the spread of the virus behind bars, a leading human rights watchdog said Monday.
 Human Rights Watch released a report based on letters smuggled from prison and interviews with inmates and their relatives. It documented multiple cases of detainees who died after experiencing suspected virus symptoms without being tested or receiving adequate medical treatment.
 Tens of thousands of people in Egypt are crammed into what rights groups say are overcrowded and unsanitary prisons.
 Despite appeals for the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi to release thousands of inmates to curb the pandemic, authorities have accelerated a long-running crackdown on dissent, arresting health workers, journalists and critics who voice concerns over the government’s handling of the pandemic.
 One activist Sanaa Seif, was arrested last month after raising the alarm over a possible outbreak in the prison where her brother, prominent political prisoner Alaa Abdel-Fatah, is being held. Her family's fears have grown since authorities suspended visitation rights as a precaution against infection. Prison policies have been applied erratically since the start of the pandemic, said her sister Mona Seif, with guards often refusing to let in disinfectants and medicine for inmates or pass letters to families desperate for information.
 “Instead of providing adequate medical care and health measures needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Egyptian government tries to obscure a serious health crisis in prisons,” said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at HRW.

He added: “It will bring a major change in this area, will generate more footfall, and create more jobs for the community. Locals will have access to a lot more new shops with different uses.
 “As this part of the centre was badly rundown it was discouraging the local community – redeveloping it will have a positive impact.
 “In the long run, we would love to see Greenhills a really up and coming area, with positive facilities and activities on offer.
 “In our future plan, we will be looking to do more projects like this within areas that can be redeveloped.”
 “Due to COVID-19 we suffered huge losses and we didn’t get any help at all, but thankfully we still managed to carry on with our project.”

BUTLER COUNTY, Ohio (FOX19) - A local woman revealed the details Monday night of what happened recently when a local groomer returned her once-healthy dog with new and severe injuries, leading the dog to be euthanized that day.The Butler County Sheriff’s Office released information about the case Monday morning. It revolves around Tina Brady, her 14-year-old Yorkshire terrier, Lacey, and the groomer, Andra Edison.Brady tells FOX19 NOW she and her husband had taken the 4-lb. dog to the grooming business where Edison worked once before, so they trusted her.The groomer business had shut down during the pandemic, so Edison was operating out of her home at the time, according to the sheriff’s office.Brady says when she dropped off Lacey to Edison, the dog was fine, but when she got her back 90 minutes later, she knew right away something was wrong.“[Edison] hands her to me, and [Lacey]‘s kind of yelping and stuff, and I looked at her and she kind of had a spot on her head, and I asked [Edison] what’s wrong with that,” Brady said. “[Edison] said [Lacey] was scratching really bad and started flipping around in the cage as soon as I left.”Brady says Edison tried to claim Lacey had been in bad shape when the dog was dropped off.“I was like, why would I drop her off if she was that way?” Brady mused.Brady says Edison also suggested perhaps Lacey had a seizure, but Brady says the dog had never experienced one before.“[Edison] was just kind of crying and stuff, and was like, ‘I am afraid if you take her to the vet, they will put her down,' and I thought, ‘Why would they put her down?‘” Brady recalled.Brady says she asked Edison how much she owed, to which she says Edison replied “Nothing.”“I said, ‘Well, you put time into this, this was your job,‘ and she was like, ‘No, I can’t charge you.‘”Brady says she decided to take Lacey to a veterinarian to get checked out. It transpired the dog had bleeding on the brain and several broken ribs.The Butler County Sheriff’s Office said it appeared Edison held Lacey down on the grooming table with all Edison’s body weight.Brady says the bleeding in the dog’s brain is ultimately why she had to be put down.“She was our baby,” Brady said. “We would like to know what happened to her, but then, on the other hand, we are scared to know what she did to her.”Edison has since been charged with cruelty to a companion animal.Lacey’s owners say they hope the woman is never allowed to touch another dog again.Copyright 2020 WXIX.

After a five month Covid-19 hiatus, Lamar County students likely will be headed back to school after Labor Day if action by North Lamar ISD school trustees Monday night is any indication.
 Although other county school boards have yet to make an in-person start date decision, Paris, Prairiland and Chisum probably will follow suit after hearing from health district director Gina Prestridge on Monday.
 “Lamar County superintendents met after a 10 a.m. (Monday) meeting with health officials,” Superintendent Kelli Stewart told trustees. “I would not want to speak on behalf of them, but three of the four are looking at a Sept. 8 start date and the fourth may begin earlier with virtual learning.”

If ever we could use a balm from the ways of our messed up world, now is the time. One method I've found to escape from reality over the years is through the movies. And though trips to the cinema are on hold, our TV sets are where most current movies are finding homes.      Yes, there's a lot of emotional turmoil and grisly horror in much of today's film fare, but once in a while, something pleasant slips through. "Fisherman's Friends" is one of those. It's a real charmer, a gentle and funny little film that would be a perfect half of a twin bill with ""The Full Monty." It's been kicking around for a couple of years, had a release in its native England in early 2019, and is finally seeing the light of day in the U.S.      Based on true events from 2009, but fictionalized left and right, it tells the unlikely story of a bunch of small-town men, most of them lobster fishermen, all close friends, in the village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, who, after a hard day out on the water, would retire to their local pub, The Golden Lion, for a few pints and a lengthy singalong of traditional sea shanties.      No, nothing all that unlikely there. That part comes in with the introduction of four city dwellers, visiting Port Isaac for a day of yachting, hearing the 10 men - known collectively as Fisherman's Friends - singing, and believing that they could be the next successful boy band or, as mentioned in a quick visual gag, buoy band.      These visitors work at a music management company in London and are always on the lookout for the next big thing. But their belief in Fisherman's Friends is a gag, one that three of the four don't let the fourth city boy in on, and coerce into getting the 10 a cappella singers to sign on.      OK, that's not quite the way the real story played out, but the film's version works just fine. The city boys think the villagers are rubes, and the villagers think the city boys are wankers. Truth is - at least the truth told in the film - they are wankers, though Danny (Daniel Mays), whose leg his pals are pulling, appears to be a decent fellow, and is only doing the job his fun- loving but uncaring boss Troy (Noel Clarke) has ordered him to do.      By the time Danny catches on, he's already convinced the initially uncooperative fisherman and group frontman Jim (James Purefoy) to take a chance with him, and has given his word that they'll be treated honorably. When his boss tells him to end the charade, he can't, because he's a man of his word.      That's about as dramatic as the film gets, and in its lengthy-feeling two-hour running time, there's a lot of filler for viewers to deal with. The tough, hearts-of-gold fishermen continually rag on good-natured Danny, but nothing develops from that. There's a two-minute segment of trouble from the Coastal Guard, but that fizzles out. Tempers flare during a trivia night at the pub, and are immediately quashed. There's a boating accident, a daring rescue and a concussion. But that's never mentioned again.      The script tosses in a love interest for Danny - Jim's divorced daughter, and single mom, Alwyn (Tuppence Middleton), and offers up back stories on Jim's sometimes negative attitude, Jim's father Jago's (David Hayman) history with the sea, and a fleeting mention of Danny once being in rehab. But it turns out to be a stream of small stories that keep starting, don't go anywhere, and are forgotten, and then there's another small story.      The only other bits of drama that do take root involve some money problems that could affect the fate of The Golden Lion AKA the heart of the village, and the plot point that reduces the number of singing fishermen from 10 to nine (With so much of the story being fictionalized, did the filmmakers really need to keep a death in there?)      But aside from those instances, the film is unrepentantly upbeat, even featuring some last-minute extremely happy storytelling to cap it off. It's not very believable, and kind of twee, but that part really did happen.      "Fisherman's Friends" will be available on digital and On Demand beginning July 24.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Fisherman's Friends"   Written by Piers Ashworth, Meg Leonard, and Nick Moorcroft; directed by Chris Foggin   With James Purefoy, Daniel Mays, David Hayman, Tuppence Middleton   Rated PG-13
