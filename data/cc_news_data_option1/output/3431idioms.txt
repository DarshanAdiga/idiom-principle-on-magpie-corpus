WASHINGTON (AP) — During the coronavirus pandemic the use of telehealth visits has taken off after Medicare temporarily relaxed restrictions that predated the smartphone era. Consultations via tablets and phones were a boon to patients and doctors who were unable to visit face to face when society shut down. Telehealth visits have dropped with the economic reopening, but are still far more common than before. Now there’s a push to make telemedicine a permanent mainstay of the government’s flagship health program. But it's going to take involvement by Congress to do away with the old restrictions. Many private insurance plans, including those in Medicare Advantage, offer some level of telemedicine coverage.

Hotel and restaurant bodies said the latest Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) guidelines which include their suggestions on lifting curbs on bars, increasing capacity limits for social gatherings and easing of inter state movement should provide the much needed fillip to the industry. They expect many states to follow suit and relax existing restrictions. Pradeep Shetty, hononary secretary, Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) said the association is glad that the centre has taken into account their suggestions on doing away with curbs on bars and increasing capacity limits for gatherings, besides easing inter state movement. Maharashtra may take time considering the continuing surge, but we think states like Delhi, Karnataka, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan can allow hospitality companies to restart operations in a full fledged manner outside containment zones, Anurag Katriar, president, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI). “States cannot defy the centre. Point 4 of the new guidelines clearly implies no state can become a cowboy state. The economy is being shattered by mini lockdowns. We expect many states including Delhi to now allow bars to resume operations and relax restrictions for restaurants, said Rahul Singh, founder and CEO of The Beer Cafe. Manu Chandra, chef partner for brands such as SodaBottleOpenerWala, Toast & Tonic, Fatty Bao and Monkey Bar said all this while, state governments and excise departments said they can’t be in violation of the MHA guidelines. “The MHA guidelines had very categorically prohibited bars till Unlock 3.0. With Unlock 4.0, with the omission of the word bars, it opens up the avenue for states to now decide whether they want F&B; outlets which have bar licenses to operate under localised guidelines that they set in,” he said. “The coast is clear. I feel with enough safety protocols, the service of alcohol at tables is okay. It is a desperately needed revenue stream for the industry and for the state. How else will they make money,” he added. Besides lifting curbs on bars, which had continued till Unlock 3.0, the ceiling on marriage related gatherings, which have contributed to the revenues for hotels, has been extended upto 100 from September 21 from the existing 50. Other social and entertainment functions will be permitted with a ceiling of 100 with effect from September 21 with mandatory social distancing protocols. The guidelines also state there shall be no restriction on inter state and intra state movement of people and no separate permissions will be required for such movements. “Many people have homes in the hills and due to restrictions on inter-state movement, they have not been able to head back home. While the centre has said there should not be any restrictions on inter state movement, we have a resort in Uttarakhand and we are waiting for a clarification from the state on matters like the PCR tests,” said Ankur Bhatia, executive director of Bird Group which owns Roseate Hotels & Resorts and is chairman for CII's tourism committee for Northern India. “There is definitely a surge in cases but this will definitely help. Right now, a lot of people are not heading to other states because of the fear that they will go through tests and will have to stay quarantined for longer periods. The directions to states are pretty clear. Now it is up to them,” he added. Manbeer Choudhary, president, Hotel & Restaurant Association of Haryana (HRAH) said as per the centre, the hospitality industry is open in all forms now with the doing away of bars in the list of prohibited activities. This is a positive sign from the centre. We would like to think no state will defy the MHA guidelines, he said.

Estevan Hernandez, 67, left this earth to be with his Heavenly Father on August 26, 2020. He peacefully passed away in a Killeen hospital surrounded by his loving family. A Memorial Celebration will be held on Thursday, September 3, 2020, which would have been his 68th Birthday, at 2:00 p.m. at Harper- Talasek Funeral Home in Temple.
 Estevan was born and raised in Temple, Texas and was the youngest son of twelve children. After he graduated from Temple High School, he married Cynthia Ramirez and worked for Santa Fe Railroad. When their first daughter was born, he left the traveling life of the railroad and started his career in Plumbing to be closer to home. A few years later he welcomed a second daughter and his family was complete. He was a devoted husband and father and cherished the time he had with his girls. Most afternoons he would go straight from his work boots to his tennis shoes so he could play catch with his girls or work on whatever sport they were playing at the time. He was a Black Belt in Tae Kwan Do and proudly watched his girls follow in his footsteps and do the same. He taught them that the world was theirs and they could do anything they put their mind to. You couldn’t have found a more supportive and loving father. He was devoted to his career and became a Master Plumber. He mentored anyone that worked hard and wanted to learn and was proud when he witnessed their successes. He never asked anyone to do something that he wasn’t willing to do himself. He enjoyed archery and competing with his Traditional Bows. He was a very talented leather worker. He loved to make his own patterns and crafted beautiful archery quivers, belts, and wallets by hand. He loved making one-of- a-kind gifts for his friends and family. After twenty-three years of marriage Estevan and Cynthia divorced and parted as the best of friends, with love and respect for one another. They continued to enjoy time with their children, grandchildren, and eventually, great-grandchildren. Estevan got remarried in 2001 to Suzy Hernandez. They enjoyed a quiet and scenic life in Kempner, Texas. He lived his life just as he wanted to and made the most of every day. Although Estevan’s life on earth was short, it was full of joy, happiness and love. He will be missed greatly by many, but knew what awaited him after this world, and always said he would be ready when God called him home.
 He was preceded in death by his parents, Justo and Josefa Hernandez of Temple; three brothers, Jesse Hernandez of Waco, Joe Hernandez of Fort Worth, and Frank Hernandez of Fort Worth; and one sister, Rosie Calderon of Temple.

But the concessions Miami takes with inexperienced run fits can be bolstered when you add a physical tackler like Brandon Jones — and when you get more athletic on the second level of the defense. Those are two boxes the Dolphins did indeed check this offseason. And with the trade of LB Raekwon McMillan over the weekend, it appears as though the second level athleticism will offer even more sideline to sideline range and help make sure there are contested gaps across the board. McMillan, to his credit, was an excellent run defender between the tackles. But he becomes a player who stands out like a sore thumb when you're able to get him into space.

I found him on Facebook. I was on Facebook soliciting for funds for my NGO project when this guy sent me a message in my inbox. I thought, “How did this guy even become my friend that he’s sending me messages?” He hadn’t commented on anything of mine or even liked any of my posts but there he was, throwing words at me in my inbox. He spoke about my NGO and continued to give me advice on some other things I could do to improve the fundraising. Judging from the way he talked, he was also very passionate about the work of my NGO.      He requested a meeting after a week of talking on the phone which I gladly accepted thinking he was going to make a donation to my NGO. I needed money and I needed all hands on board to help make the program a successful one but he had a different agenda. He was looking for an opportunity to meet me because he had been given a prophecy about the woman he was going to marry. He wanted to meet me and see if I fit the description of the woman in the prophecy.      We met. We spoke. While I had my mind on my NGO project, he had his mind on me. Checking me out and asking questions to confirm whether or not I fit the description. He said, “I was so convinced you were the one. From the way you looked to the fact that we had so much in common. It could only be the works of the Lord.”      I come from a family where the trend in the marriages of the women wasn’t good; they marry late, or marry early and won’t give birth or give birth with different men. I didn’t want that for myself so I started praying for a different marital story when I was just but a secondary school student. Again, I’m the last child of my parents. I had four sisters and they all got married while I was growing up. I was a witness to their marriages and that gave me the opportunity to imagine the kind of marriage I wanted for myself. I didn’t treat the issue of marriage with kid gloves. I wanted the first man I dated to be the only one so when he proposed, I also started praying about it to have a confirmation from God.      But he started giving me pressure. He wanted an answer as soon as possible. I told him, “Honestly, because of my upcoming program, I haven’t had the time to pray about it so give me some more time. Maybe till the end of the program so I can have a clear mind to decide.” Just when I had convinced him to give me some time, two pastors also came to me with their love proposals. Straightforward I knew I wouldn’t be at peace with them. One of the Pastors didn’t live in Ghana. Three of my sisters’ husbands lived abroad and I was a witness to how their marriage suffered so I wasn’t enthused about marrying someone who didn’t live here with me. I let the pastors go.

What isn't always obvious is how much of a battery pack's energy is usable versus its maximum theoretical or gross capacity. To protect the battery from excessive degradation over time, EVs never fully drain or fully charge the pack. Some automakers disclose gross capacity, some report usable energy, and some provide both. But plenty are cagey on the details. For example, when the Taycan launched, Porsche claimed it had a 93.4-kWh battery capacity, which is closing in on the Model S's. That made the Taycan's low range figures even more surprising. But it turns out that the amount of usable energy in the Taycan's pack is only 83.7 kilowatt-hours, or nearly 15 percent less than that of the Model S.
 Based on the limited data we have, it seems that Tesla allows its cars to use more of a pack's capacity than other manufacturers do. We suspect that's partially because the company puts some of the responsibility on the driver to choose how high to charge the battery, noting that anything above a 90 percent charge should be reserved only for trips, not everyday use.
 ## Efficiency Gains
 Tesla's largest battery pack carries the energy equivalent of just 2.9 gallons of gas when fully charged. The key to extending EPA range is to use less electricity to propel the vehicle and to recapture as much energy as possible using the electric motors to slow the vehicle whenever the driver lifts off the accelerator during the EPA cycles' many slowdowns. Tesla's aggressive regenerative braking alone nets it a 13 percent gain in range versus the Porsche Taycan, which waits until the driver presses the brake pedal before initiating meaningful regen [see "Power Ranger"]. This is one piece of Tesla's holistic approach to efficiency that also includes its vehicles' ability to roll down the road with less friction than their competitors [see "A Lighter Load"].

There was delight or Bandon after securing an all-important draw against Mallow in a crunch Co-Op Superstores Co. SAHC at Coachford on Saturday. Though the West Cork side had the laurels snatched with a late Mallow point, the point was enough with Charleville claiming their anticipated victory over Fermoy in the other group game. Bandon players jumped for joy at the full-time whistle, the stalemate earning them a quarter-final meeting with Kanturk.
 The look of quiet satisfaction on the face of team mentor Paddy Cahalane told its own story.
 “As it transpired, Mallow fought gamely, it went right down to the wire, the lads did fantastic in a competitive grouping. We lost to Charleville early on, having just five days to prepare for that game, the dual clubs are being crucified yet it’s a brilliant championship, all it needs is a bit of tweaking.
 “We‘ve to be happy, probably Charleville were a step ahead of the rest, now our attention turns to football and a meeting against Fermoy next week where a position in the knockout phase could also be a possibility”.
 Mallow needed a win and had a goal within 40 seconds when Niall O’Riordan placed the isolated Seán Hayes to billow the Bandon net. For a spell, Mallow looked the more convincing side, benefiting from the input of John Healy, Kevin Sheehan and Darragh Moynihan, with the industrious Paul Lyons and Aaron Sheehan on target for a 1-4 to 0-1 advantage.
 Bandon required remedial action, the move of Michael Cahalane to centre back proved pivotal and they were right in the game once Darren Crowley set up Mark Sugrue for a peach of a goal.
 With Cahalane towering into the game, Bandon had thrown off earlier anxieties, Cahalane, Adam Murphy and Sugrue adding points for parity — 1-10 apiece at the break. And though Mallow restarted with a surge and a pair of points, Bandon hauled themselves back into contention, the play of Cahalane, Donough Lucey, Jason Hickey and Conor Calnan yielded four points on the bounce.
 Mallow showed commendable battling qualities, Moynihan and O’Riordan pointing to level matters. And as the standard of hurling improved, Ronan Crowley and Lyons pointed massive efforts at either end.
 Though Sheehan nudged Mallow ahead, back came Bandon, Crowley obliged on the double including a booming 80m free. But Charles Carroll replied and the teams were deadlocked for the 10th occasion.
 But it wasn't enough for the Mallow men.

Within a few hours after Hindustan Times reported about the plight of Mumbai's dabbawalas and their appeal to the public to donate cycles, good samaritans on the internet instantly responded with help.
 Manish Mundra, who has produced films like 'Masaan' and 'Newton', pledged 100 cycles for the dabbawalas after reading the story.
 "Anybody in Mumbai can help me negotiate for 100 cycles for Mumbai Dabbawala association. They need Atlas double bar cycle for sturdiness. I am donating 100 cycles. Anybody else wanna donate or contribute for more ?', he tweeted. Mundra's appeal got a good response with nearly a 100 people volunteering to help the community.
 "Please count me in for 10 bicycles," stated a Twitter user.
   
   
 Subhash Talekar, president, Mumbai Dabbawala Association said he was flooded with phone calls. "So many people have come forward to help our dabbawalas. The community is really happy and is looking forward to start work now. Thanks to this, thousands of dabbawalas will now get help. We are all eager to start work soon and are now hoping to get permissions to ply on the trains too," he added.


 On Saturday, Mumbai Dabbawala Association appealed to people to donate cycles to them as they could not afford to pay the maintenance costs of their rusted cycles which have been lying outside the stations for six months now. The association has been demanding the central government to start regular local trains or allow dabbawalas into the essential services category. They submitted a written request to that effect on Saturday.
 There are nearly 5,000 dabbawalas working in the city who deliver meals to people on a daily basis. Known for their timely and accurate food deliveries, Mumbai's dabbawalas have been used as a case study in several management institutes.
 In 2003, when Prince Charles met a few members of the community, he lauded their work. Ever since, the dabbawalas have always been in the limelight. With the growing uncertainty around the nature of work and the utility of tiffins in future, the community is now clueless about what the future holds.

A magnificent third quarter from Fr O’Neill’s laid the foundation for a comfortable win over Ballymartle in the Co-Op Superstores Cork Senior A hurling championship at Cobh on Saturday.
 Ballymartle finished the game with 13 men following the dismissal of Darren McCarthy in the 20th minute and goalkeeper Declan McCarthy was dismissed three minutes from full time.
 The game started in a welter of excitement with Fr O’Neill’s opening up with consecutive points from Declan Dalton and Billy Dunne. Suddenly, Ballymartle responded to the wake- up call and a Darren McCarthy point in the sixth minute injected energy into the side.
 A minute later poor defending allowed Brian Corry plenty of space as he blasted the ball to the back of the net for a Ballymartle goal.
 On the next possession, Fr O’Neill’s responded in style when Rob Cullinane set up Declan Dalton and their talisman showed no mercy with a thunderous shot past the keeper.
 Incredibly Ballymartle hit back with a goal: Corry showed a nice touch to drill an unstoppable shot beyond Colin Sloane.
 When O’Neill’s needed inspiration, Billy Dunne scored the first of his three goals in the 18th minute but despite playing with 14 men a late Corry point ensured the teams were level at the break.
 On the resumption, Fr O’Neills ran riot scoring three goals in the opening 13 minutes with Dunne, Liam O’Driscoll and Dalton on target. Indeed, in that phase, Fr O’Neill’s outscored their opponents 3-6 to 0-3.
 The Dalton and Dunne combination worked wonders as the latter secured his hat- trick with a sublime strike in the closing minutes it put the icing on the cake for the O’Neill’s hard-working forward.
 By virtue of this win, Fr O’Neill’s booked their semi-final berth and if they can produce similar performances in the coming weeks, they could be very well serious championship contenders.
