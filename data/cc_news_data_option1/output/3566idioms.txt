I would be embarrassed and grossed out on behalf of her six young children, who clearly can see their own father is pilling on the gross. And Mrs Nico Mary is no innocent either, she can do as many posing for selfies and get more Followers, at the end of the day she is making hay on an sleazy financial arranged affair between a man 30 years older than her. They both are repulsive.

“This morning, I contacted the attorney general to demand that he immediately close Case 2,000 and cancel the delusional indictment filed against the prime minister, and to demand the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the affair made public last night by [Channel 12 journalist] Amit Segal. Our claims that Case 2,000 is totally without grounds was substantiated yesterday in light of the revelations surrounding the investigation, which was carried out amid a corrupt conflict of interest.”

Former world champion boxer L Sarita Devi has recovered from COVID-19 but has quarantined herself away from her home in Imphal for at least the next 10 days to ensure that her young son's "well being is not compromised".
 The 38-year-old had tested positive for the dreaded virus on August 17 along with her husband Thoiba Singh. She was discharged from a care facility on Monday after returning a negative test.
 "I came back yesterday after testing negative. My husband was discharged last week but I had to spend a few more days at the COVID care centre after my test came positive. But thankfully I am out of there now," Sarita told PTI.
 She has lodged herself at the hostel of her academy near her home in Imphal to ensure that her seven-year-old son Tomthin is not at risk. The child had tested negative for the virus last month.
 "If I would have gone home, he would have come running to me. And I can't take that risk. For his sake, I have decided to isolate myself at my academy's hostel," she said.
 "My husband is also here but he will leave because his isolation will be over in the next couple of days as he was discharged before me," she added.
 Sarita was mostly asymptomatic for the duration of her illness, experiencing only mild fever for a day along with a blocked nose.
 "I had mild cold when I got myself tested along with my husband. It saddened me to start with because my kid, who tested negative, left from the facility crying. He was calling out for me. That was tough to deal with," she recalled.
 "But then I saw so many people fighting it out and I told myself I can't allow a virus to defeat me. The resolve helps, you cannot lose it mentally. Staying strong in the mind is important to beat this virus," she said.
 Sarita is an Asian Games bronze-winner, besides being a five-time Asian Championships gold-medallist.
 She was the second boxer to test positive for the virus after the legendary Dingko Singh.
 Dingko, an Asian Games gold-medallist who is also battling cancer, had recovered from the infection after enduring a month-long hospitalisation.
 Sarita is one of the longest serving and among the most decorated women boxers of the country.
 She became a world champion in the 2006 edition and added two bronze medals in the later editions. She is also a Commonwealth Games silver-medallist besides being a national medallist.
 "Another challenge beaten," she laughed, referring to the dreaded illness she recovered from.
 "I guess some challenge here and there helps you stay on your toes."

 SEOUL, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Thousands of trainee doctors in South Korea returned to work on Tuesday after ending a more than two-week strike as the country continued to post three-digit rises in new daily coronavirus infections.
 The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 136 new cases as of midnight Monday, after the rate fell to a three-week low of 119 a day earlier. The total infections rose 21,432, with 341 deaths.
 The daily tally has steadily dropped since it reached a peak of 441 last month after the government imposed unprecedented social distancing rules to blunt a second wave of outbreaks from churches and political rallies.
 Efforts to blunt the latest epidemic has been complicated by the strike launched on Aug. 21 by some 16,000 intern and resident doctors against the government's medical reform proposals.
 The trainee doctors restarted work after agreeing to end the walkout on Monday, though many medical students continued to resist final licensing exams as part of the protest.
 The intern and resident doctors are the backbone of healthcare services in emergency rooms and intensive care units, and hospitals increasingly grappled with delays and disruptions amid constant growths in COVID-19 patients.
 Authorities are weighing whether to extend the social distancing curbs ahead of Chuseok, one of the country's biggest holidays this month, which would see tens of millions of people travel nationwide.
 President Moon Jae-in said the daily numbers are expected to drop below 100 by the holiday, though health officials have urged against visits and gatherings.
 "Despite moderate declines in daily cases, cluster infections have increased fivefold compared to last month, and continued to emerge from various groups, including religious, medical and sport facilities as well as offices and social gatherings," Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a meeting.

Willy non ha chiuso gli occhi di fronte a quella scena e senza pensarci su ha attraversato la strada per soccorrere l'ex compagno. Si è messo tra i due, ha allontanato l'aggressore che però ha preso il cellulare e ha avvertito il resto della sua comitiva. In tre minuti un Suv nero è arrivato sgommando, sono scesi in tre, lasciando aperti gli sportelli, e insieme al quarto che era già lì, hanno cominciato ad aggredire il ventunenne e gli altri presenti. Tutti però sono riusciti a scappare, tranne Willy. Che è finito a terra dopo calci allo sterno e al volto: "Sembravano mosse di arti marziali", spiega ancora la donna residente a pochi metri dal luogo dell'omicidio. Il pestaggio si è concluso solo quando Willy ha smesso di respirare.
