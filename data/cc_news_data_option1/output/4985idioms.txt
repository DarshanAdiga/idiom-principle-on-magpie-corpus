Danbury finds minor COVID violations in business inspections

Ho, ho, ho. Christmas 2020 is just weeks away and it’s time for all good holiday elves to finish their shopping. I have a few ideas to help with the list.
 With all of its challenges, 2020 has been the year we expanded our gardens and experimented in the kitchen — both good places to look for gift ideas. Gardeners love to play in the soil and trim leaves. House plants can be a way to do this indoors.
 Find your inner hippie, and give macramé plant hangers. Not only are they a fun, creative way to add plants to a room, they also let you position or hang the plants in sunny spots without taking up valuable table space. Macramé hangers come in all designs and lengths. Heck, maybe you have skills and can knot your own! Add a planter, and a plant mister and you have a fun, imaginative gift.
 Needle nose hand shears or garden scissors are useful gifts gardeners will love. Combine them with a pair of garden gloves, a fingernail brush and hand salve for a stocking full of gifts.
 Terrariums are another way to bring the garden indoors. There are many shapes and sizes to choose from, including structured, glass table-sized houses or glass bowls. No need to worry about filling it, your gardener will have ideas and lots of fun creating their personalized gardens.
 I love wind chimes and have them hanging outside of windows, doors and in the tree limbs of my shade garden. This year I have asked Santa to replace the ones outside my back door. They are very old and the weather has taken a toll. Corinthian Bells wind chimes are made in Manassas Park, Virginia, and have a beautiful, deep sound when the wind blows. I have seen them for sale at local garden centers and feed shops.
 Keeping it local, I noticed beautiful doormats in several area stores. What a fun gift. Something everyone needs, but not everyone will invest in for themselves. I have them at every outside door, so one always needs to be replaced.

Many of the existing travel behavior models fall short in characterizing the gender differences in transportation. Understanding these differences aids development of sustainable cities typically from a social equity perspective. In this research paper, authors identify a modeling framework to determine the work choice propensity among females in the city of Bangalore. An initial data analysis provides a descriptive variation of the work choice propensity among males and females, and the further regression models elicits the impact of various factors on the work choice propensity of individuals. In the regression framework, the interaction model examines the existence of gendered variation in the influence of various factors, and subsequent models estimates the influence of these factors separately for males and females. The significant impact of the gender incorporated interaction terms in the study reflected the need for gender specific market segment. Further, the stronger influence of social conformation factors on the work choice of women indicated the need for flexible working hours and childcare facilities at work for women. In a developing country context, the study also elicited the role of awareness and educational programs to revamp the societal attitudes, rooted on the patriarchal mind-set, against women's work participation.

We are a big brand and such things come with the territory. If we were some obscure and struggling business, no one would care about us. The other thing is that I am an ordinary person running a big business. I go wherever I want and I socialize. That’s my approach. These people then mistake my approach for a weakness. They think that I am easy to extort money from.

Sancho walked away from Manchester City’s academy at that stage, with a young hopeful believing that senior opportunities would be easier to come by outside of England.
 That big career call has been more than justified in Dortmund, with the talented 20-year-old now a senior international and established part of an ambitious Bundesliga outfit.
 Matondo is treading a similar path, having made his way from City to Schalke, and the Wales international believes anything is possible for Sancho if he remains grounded and avoids getting caught up in the hype that has already generated intense talk of interest from Manchester United.
 “With the pandemic and the situation we’re in, we tend to stay apart. We do speak now and then,” Matondo told _talkSPORT_ of his former City colleague.
 “He’s doing very well and I’m proud of him, and I always believed he would do what he’s doing, because he’s always had that ability [since] being with him at Manchester City.
 “It’s helped me having him here, because before I came – and he knew I was coming – we had a good long chat about everything here and what Germany is like and he gave me confidence that I could start to achieve what he’s achieving.
 “He’s doing well. It’s an aim for me to start pushing and helping Schalke and hopefully I can do that.
 “Everyone that knows Jadon and grew up around him or played with him knew how talented he is. You never ever questioned his talent. When you know football and you see Jadon play, you know already that, if he can keep his head and do the right things both on and off the field, he can have a top career and he’s proving that right now.

Looking ahead, those organizations pivoting funds away from marketing will ultimately endure longer-term impacts. Marketing takes time to build on, and by toggling budgets up and down, past investments will begin to lose momentum. A dip in marketing spend will put these companies well behind others who continue to invest. Those who choose to navigate through this uncertainty and prepare for recovery will be far more successful in the long run.

Administering the coronavirus vaccine to Wisconsin residents took another step forward Thursday as state health officials said they hope to receive nearly 50,000 doses my mid-December.
 This news comes on the heels of a grim milestone this week, as 50 Jefferson County residents have died from the virus since the pandemic began in March.
 “We have 50 deaths now,” stated Gail Scott, director of the Jefferson County Health Department. “It is a mixture of people who were residing in long-term care facilities and in the community.”
 Gov. Tony Evers wrote to the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asking that Wisconsin be prioritized for vaccine distribution, so the state’s 450,000 health care workers can be vaccinated.
 The state’s plan to distribute the vaccine prioritizes front-line workers who have been exposed to COVID patients. Also, residents of long-term care facilities, people over the age of 65 and some essential workers will be the first offered the vaccine.
 “The next few months will be a critical time for our state,” Evers said at a news conference.
 The governor made the case to prioritize Wisconsin and pass a federal aid bill that would send more than half a billion dollars to the state.
 On Thursday, the Department of Health Services reported another 4,618 cases of the virus as the state nears the 400,000 mark of positive cases.
 The case numbers have subsided in the state over the last few weeks when there were more than 7,000 cases per day, placing Wisconsin among the top outbreaks in the nation. Since then, cases have ticked downward leading up to Thanksgiving, when health officials feared large gatherings could lead to further spread.
 “We should see observable (cases) starting today (from the holiday), but we have already heard from our staff that the cases they are calling are related to the holiday gatherings,” said Samroz Jakvani, epidemiologist with the Jefferson County Health Department. “Theoretically, we should definitely see an increase from current levels.”
 Jakvani said looking at county and state coronavirus case numbers, the drop in cases is not as significant as it looks because fewer people are getting tested and less PCR tests — that are more reliable at concluding a person is positive for the virus — are being used. There are more rapid tests being used that are less reliable, he said, with many of those probable for the virus, but not confirmed.
 That is detracting from the number of cases reported as confirmed, he said.
 “Right now, if you look at the county graphs, or the state overall, it looks like there has been a huge drop in new cases per day,” Jakvani said. “While there has been a drop from the levels of new cases per day that we were previously seeing, the real drop is not as huge.”
 He did say it is a significant difference from weeks earlier when Jefferson County was seeing 75 to 90 cases a day.
 There have been 5,485 cases of the virus in Jefferson County since March.
 Testing sites continue to see high a number of people getting tested in the county.
 The testing site at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater has conducted 6,500 tests since the site opened on Nov. 9. The site is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the Kris Russell Volleyball Arena in the Williams Center, 907 W. Schwager Drive, Whitewater. Anyone 5 years and older can get a free, fast COVID-19 test.
 Preregistration is required at doineedacovid19test.com. People will receive their results within 15 minutes.
 Also, Fair Park in Jefferson is holding a testing site from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday.
 Also on Thursday, Evers said Wisconsin restaurants and small businesses affected by the pandemic will receive $45 million in grants. Eligible businesses will get $20,000 by the end of the year.

The government has passed laws that allow the literal police to literally police the internet for speech the government doesn't like. This law was struck down by the courts but there can be little doubt a replacement is in the works. The government has also sided with extremists by engaging in speech-related prosecutions that target citizens who've criticized extremists. The firebombing of a French satirical newspaper by Islamic extremists hasn't nudged the dial towards freer speech, unfortunately. The government has also made insulting certain politicians a crime and has given itself broad powers to take down internet speech.
