Since the pandemic began, the whole universe that is food production, supply and distribution has been hit with multiple, complex and ongoing changes in nearly every sector. Food banks and pantries are an important sector of the food supply and distribution chain, benefitting both businesses donating food products via the perk of tax deductions, as well as people living in poverty that cannot make ends meet.

Unanimously approved a three-year user agreement for “The Bora Dora” district to allow businesses to utilize the district for outdoor seating. City Manager Tracey Schultz Kobylarz said it is similar to the outdoor café ordinance. Clark said the best thing is to change the ordinance to work it out so the LCC will be satisfied. He said it is not permanent and is letting the business use the city’s property with a review every year. John Winter of Egan’s Pub said they want to put up igloos next to their business for cold- weather dining and they need 22’ more room on the Fourth Street Square. He said they are buying two igloos for $16,000 and it will be something classy for the downtown. He said they thought they could be used from mid October to mid March. He said during the warm months, if others need that space on the square for their events, they could pull back their outdoor dining temporarily. Winter said he hoped the Bayou and Johnny’s would get on board and apply for the outside dining /alcohol state permit;

On top of pantry perennial challenges of often having to operate with restricted-use funds, uncertain supply lines like donations that include either very limited items or sudden and overwhelming supplies (think cases and cases of foods and beverages that lack essential nutrients), and their frequent reliance on a volunteer workforce; food banks and pantries have had to continually alter their food supply and distribution systems to protect the growing number of already vulnerable people from increased risk of exposure to the virus.
 If you are in a position to donate to food banks or pantries at this time, bear in mind that cash allows pantries to be more flexible in serving the needs of individuals and families. People should never donate expired or damaged foods.

The last time I had a face to face long chat with him was when I lost my child. On 30th July 2018, around 7:30 pm, at a private clinic, I lost my child at birth, due to pregnancy complications. It was a baby boy and I had planned to name him Pumaya. He lived for just a few minutes I guess. It was the fault of the medical officers, but I let go of every pain and bitterness I felt that evening because I am fully aware of the systemic failure of our country.

As a psychiatric social worker in Rockville, Md., Karol Kullberg has spent most of her work life in a small room, listening to patients face to face — work she finds rewarding and fulfilling, she says. When the pandemic hit, she was able to work from home — a blessing in some ways, but not others. Offering therapy online, via telehealth appointments, has been convenient, Kulberg says, but she also finds it isolating and somewhat alienating.

A Baltic Sea ferry with 331 passengers and a crew of 98 has run aground in the Aland Islands archipelago between Finland and Sweden. Finnish authorities say there are “no lives in immediate danger” and the vessel isn't leaking.

The woman who fit that description was Eyram. She entered my life with a bang and never looked back. Come to think of it, she’s the prettiest person I’d ever come close to. She looked at me and accepted me for who I am. Other people didn’t see me though they were looking at me. To them, I was too quiet and boring so even when their eyes could see me, their mind didn’t follow suit. Eyram saw me, gave me a chance in her circle, and even found me interesting.

A loss by Houston to the Patriots this week would drop the Texans to 2-8; making it mathematically impossible for Houston to finish the year with a winning record and extends the possibility of Miami to stay in the running to potentially secure a top-3 pick for yet another week. The silver lining here? If the Texans win, at least the Patriots will have lost in the process.

I woke up the next morning to see this message; “You tell me that you love me but you have no single care for me. How could you ignore your sick girlfriend when you don’t know what she’s going through? Is that how you’re going to treat me when you marry me? It’s better we end it here and this time around, I’m very serious. Don’t come and beg me because I’m sick and tired of your fake attitude.”
