Sony lanzará en noviembre la esperada PlayStation 5, justo a tiempo para luchar contra su rival de Microsoft, la consola Xbox Series X, por reinar en la campaña navideña marcada por una pandemia de coronavirus que ha disparado el sector de los videojuegos. Las dos consolas se lanzarán con un par de días de diferencia, ambas con el objetivo de capitalizar una ‘rara avis’ en medio de la carnicería que la pandemia ha supuesto para muchos sectores de la economía. Además de una versión premium de US$ 500 de la PS5, también se ha diseñado una “edición digital” de US$ 400, sin unidad de disco para aprovechar la creciente popularidad de la descarga de juegos desde la nube. Estas versiones de la PS5 saldrán a la venta el 12 de noviembre en Australia, Norteamérica, Nueva Zelanda, México, Japón y Corea del Sur, y estarán disponibles en otros lugares una semana después, dijo la firma japonesa el último miércoles. Microsoft anunció la semana pasada que su Xbox Series X de última generación se lanzará el 10 de noviembre. El precio inicial estimado es aproximadamente el mismo que el de la PS5 completa, mientras que la Xbox Series S, la gama más barata, saldrá a la venta a finales de noviembre por US$ 299. La PS4 se ha vendido más del doble que la Xbox One, y Sony espera que juegos como “Final Fantasy XVI”, “Hogwarts Legacy” y “Spider-Man Morales” le ayuden a mantener esa hegemonía. Algunos de los juegos nuevos serán exclusivos para la PS5, lo que le dará a Sony una gran ventaja, dijo Amir Anvarzadeh, estratega de Asymmetric Advisors en Singapur. “PS5 tendrá una gran ventaja como siempre la ha tenido, porque en Europa PlayStation domina y Xbox siempre está muy por detrás”, dijo. “Pero para que los juegos de PS5 se vendan, necesitas el hardware para vender”. Sony alardeó de las capacidades de la nueva PS5 durante su presentación. “No podemos esperar a que nuestros seguidores experimenten en su propia piel la increíble velocidad, la mayor inmersión y los juegos asombrosos”, dijo el jefe de Interactive Entertainment, Jim Ryan. Las empresas de juegos han experimentado un aumento de los ingresos y una explosión de las ventas ya que muchas personas buscan distraerse durante los confinamientos decretados para contener el coronavirus. Según NPD Group, el gasto de los consumidores en videojuegos en Estados Unidos alcanzó un récord de US$ 11,600 millones en el trimestre de abril a junio, casi un tercio más que en el mismo período del año anterior. Las ventas del sector videojuegos de Sony aumentaron 32.5% en el primer trimestre fiscal del 2020-2021. Microsoft dijo en julio que sus ingresos habían aumentado 13% a US$ 38,000 millones, gracias en parte a su computación en la nube y sus servicios de juegos para la Xbox. Pero Anvarzadeh advirtió que los máximos recientes, incluido el gran éxito de Nintendo con “Animal Crossing”, no durarían mucho. “Nintendo va a tener (el equivalente a) tres trimestres de Navidad en un año, lo cual es inaudito”, dijo. “La pandemia provocó una gran distorsión del mercado que no creemos que se repita”, agregó. “Así que todos estos desarrolladores van a enfrentar grandes desafíos el próximo año, al menos desde el punto de vista del crecimiento”.

It was an opportunity and honor of a lifetime to be able to serve in the White House. I put my heart and soul into this role every single day, but at some ￼￼points, I would come home at night and I would look at myself in the mirror, and say, are you really making a difference? Does it matter? Because no matter how hard you work, no matter what you do, the president is going to do something that is detrimental to keeping Americans safe which is why are you signed up for this role. It was awful. It was terrifying.

This was how trainer James Cummings summed the stable’s likely starters in the world’s richest turf race, run at Royal Randwick on October 17.“Bivouac is our horse,’’ Cummings said when asked which sprinter the stable was considering for Godolphin’s Everest slot.“We will put him in when we have to put him in. Everything revolves around him at this stage.’’Bivouac resumes in The Shorts at Royal Randwick on Saturday and Cummings said if the four- year-old runs up to expectations, he could go straight to The Everest or have another lead-up run in the Group 2 $500,000 Premiere Stakes (1200m) on Epsom Day, October 3.As Cummings pointed out, Bivouac has won at Group 1 level second-up from a spell in the Newmarket Handicap earlier this year but the sprinter won his other major, the Golden Rose, at the third run of his spring campaign.“We have the option of giving him another run in the Premiere if we feel he needs it before The Everest,’’ he said. “We will get through this weekend, take stock and decide how he is placed to advance. I don’t think it needs to be any more complicated than that.’’ Trekking is a dual Group 1 winner of more than $3.5 million prizemoney. He did run third in The Everest last year and gunned down Gytrash in The Goodwood back in May.Cummings revealed he is leaning to starting Trekking first-up in the Group 1 $1 million Moir Stakes (1000m) at Moonee Valley on September 25.“I think I will go to the Moir with Trekking,’’ he said. “This is a weight-for-age Group 1 and Trekking is a solid weight-for-age performer.“He ran in the Moir Stakes last year and was a bit unlucky to be beaten only one-and-a-half lengths behind Nature Strip. “Trekking then won the Schillaci Stakes before his third in The Everest.’’Cummings has trained two Everest placegetters – he also had Osborne Bulls run third in 2018 – and said this year’s race is shaping as “very interesting”.“They are a different group of sprinters this year and there will be a few three-year-olds in it so it is going to be good for the race,’’ the Godolphin trainer said.“Just as they do in Europe when they run the good three-year-olds in the big weight-for-age races, these young horses taking on the older horses to find out how good they are makes for some great clashes.’’

The live export ship carrying 43 men and almost 6000 cattle capsized and sank en route from New Zealand to China during Typhoon Maysak on September 2. Among the crew still lost at sea was Bass constituent and “very dear friend to the community”, 27-year-old Will Mainprize. “Along with the nation I was very distressed to learn that Gulf Livestock I had gone missing off the coast of Japan,” said the letter Ms Archer shared with members of the Facebook group, ‘Urgent Efforts to Resume Search for Gulf Livestock I Survivors’.“What an unfathomable tragedy and I can only imagine the anguish of the friends and families of the missing crew while we await the outcome of the search and rescue mission.” Mrs Archer’s letter said she understood the Japanese Government had confirmed the air and sea search continued.“I have received requests for the Australian government to assist using satellite technology,” it went on to say. “Could you please update me on the status of the search and rescue mission and if satellite technology could be of assistance.“I appreciate your consideration in these very desperate times.”Ms Archers message was met with many messages of thanks from members of the group. patrick.gee@news.com.au

In talking to lots of other passengers about their occupations and other things, I have not come across a ton of CEOs commuting, either.

Donors are desperately needed to combat the impending influx of new blood cancer cases following a delay in diagnoses caused by the Coronavirus lockdown. Now the international DKMS stem cell charity known as 'We Delete Blood Cancer' is running Stem Cell Awareness month to try and fill the gap in donor registrations. "The need for transplants is even more urgent now than before lockdown," a charity spokesman said. "The gap in finding donors is worrying as it's even more important to offer hope during the Coronavirus outbreak to people with devastating blood cancers, whose lives have also been harmed by the pandemic. A transplant is their last hope of staying alive." Donor Sam Schmidt in Limehouse underwent a life-giving transplant just before lockdown to donate stem cells after being successfully matched with a patient from a worldwide search. The 25-year-old accounts manager registered with the charity when he moved into Narrow Street from west London after being inspired by Peter McCleave's story, a father of two young boys found to have blood cancer after being fit and running the Ironman triathlon. "It's quick and easy to sign-up to the stem cell register," Sam explained. "You just take a cotton swab of your mouth and send it off in the post. "The process isn't that bad, like giving blood. I just lay down and binge watched TV for a few hours, but knowing I was potentially saving someone's life." The search for donors continues amid widespread confusion about what is involved, which holds many volunteers back, the charity says. Among the biggest misconceptions is thinking the process is invasive, difficult, painful or involving a needle in the spine. But nine-out-of-10 donations in reality are made with blood taken from one arm into a machine that extracts the stem cells before being put back through the other arm, usually taking four to six hours. "It's incredible knowing you could be someone's only hope of survival," Sam tells you. "Covid-19 doesn't stop other people needing your help." Sam unfortunately was no match for Peter McCleave, the patient who had inspired him to sign up. Peter has been given just seven years to live, yet still hopes to find his matching donor. Yet he has encouraged through his public speaking events people like Sam in Limehouse to register online.
