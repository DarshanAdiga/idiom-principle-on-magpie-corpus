But Johnson's Conservative government has come under fire for its slow response to confronting the pandemic — allowing tens of thousands to gather at the Cheltenham horse racing festival in mid-March, for example. It's also faced criticism for its slow rollout of a coronavirus testing program.
 Over the past few days, the government has also faced acute criticism for the lack of personal protective equipment for frontline workers in hospitals, amid reports that some nurses have had to resort to cutting up garbage bags to cover themselves.
 Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed Saturday that 19 frontline workers have died from the virus.
 The Royal College of Nursing has piled more pressure on the government, urging members to refuse to treat patients as a "last resort" if adequate protections are not provided.
 Business Secretary Alok Sharma stopped short Sunday of apologizing for the lack of medical masks and gowns but said it is "absolutely right that no medical professional should be placed in a position where they have to make that choice."
 "That is why we are making sure we get the equipment to the frontline," he told Sky News.
 Figures later Sunday are expected to show that over 10,000 people in the U.K. have died after testing positive for coronavirus. That would make Britain the fourth European country after Italy, Spain and France to reach that grim milestone, even with its limited testing.
 On Saturday, Britain reported 917 new coronavirus-related deaths in its hospitals for an overall death toll of 9,875. The U.K. total only includes deaths in hospitals.
 While the number of new cases and hospitalizations appears to have plateaued, deaths are still rising. With virus death tolls in Italy and Spain on a downward slope, there are growing fears that the U.K. will end up being the country with the most virus deaths in Europe. The continent has had almost 74,000 reported coronavirus deaths.
 Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust an a scientific adviser to the British government, said the U.K. was likely to be "one of the worst, if not the worst-affected country in Europe."
 He told the BBC that Britain has "lessons to learn" from Germany, where much more widespread testing has been accompanied by much fewer coronavirus deaths.
 Last week, the British government's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, warned that the daily number of deaths would likely increase for a couple more weeks.
 Sharma refused to be drawn in on whether the U.K. will end up with the highest death toll in Europe.
 "We are at different trajectories," he said told the BBC. "We are starting to see these measures work."

GRAND RAPIDS -- Calvin track and field seniors Ryan VanAppledorn and Jordan Jorritsma have a few things in common.
 They both went to Holland Christian, are both on the track and field team and have the same quarantine past-time -- running.
 "I'm a thrower, and we kind of had a distance-running prohibition because the philosophy there was the more you run instead of bulking up and building that muscle mass kind of wears it down and turns it into lean muscle," Jorritsma said. "So since the season got canceled and quarantine started, I've started running again -- I did cross country in high school -- so I've lost like between five and 10 pounds and I can long-distance run again.
 "So that's been interesting, redoing that and seeing how utterly bad I was starting out because I hadn't done it in four years because I wasn't allowed too."
 VanAppledorn said running has kept a sense of routine in rather boring times.
 "Definitely running," VanAppledorn said. "It's a huge stress reliever. It helps you mentally, especially with the added difficulty of online classes and being home, it's hard to focus and running is definitely my best outlet to stay focused and keep a routine going."
 VanAppledorn and Jorritsma both had their senior track seasons affected by the outbreak of COVID-19.
 "This was kind of going to be my penultimate season coming back, getting to compete," Jorritsma said. "Our spring break trip didn't get to happen, so it was pretty disappointing, especially because we weren't canceled until about a week before we were supposed to leave for our spring break trip, which is the backbone of our season."
 VanAppledorn is trying to stay positive.
 "It's been a bit of a rollercoaster and the mentality keeps changing as one thing switches to another, so everyone's just figuring out how to deal with it right now," VanAppledorn said.
 Jorritsma will now have missed each of the last two track seasons. Last year, he spent the semester in Washington D.C. with a group of fellow Calvin students. They took classes with a Calvin professor, some did internships on Capitol Hill and Jorritsma worked at a law firm.
 "We would explore, we'd go talk to people from different organizations," Jorritsma said. "It was a great experience, but it did restrict me from participating in track and field."
 2020 was supposed to be his year to put a bow on track and field, but he's more disappointed he won't be able to spend time with his teammates.
 "That was the biggest loss, not getting to hang out with everybody on the team," Jorritsma said.
 VanAppledorn was recovering from an injury and was looking forward to the outdoor season. He hasn't stopped preparing despite the season cancellation.
 "I'm still treating it as if I'm still doing the work and getting my body ready," VanAppledorn said. "We're still going to do time trials and compare times, try to make the most of it."
 While both are up in the air if they will take the extra year of eligibility granted by the NCAA, they appreciated being able to attend college and compete with someone they're familiar with.
 "It's been cool having a teammate from Holland Christian here, too," VanAppledorn said.
 Though both competed in different events, they were connected through their Maroon roots.
 "It was fun when we would be at track and field meets," Jorritsma said. "We knew each other, so it was nice knowing somebody going onto the team."

Agriculture is no stranger to contagious disease.
 Drawing on sanitation experiences from outbreaks, such as avian and swine influenza or the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom in 2001, can help us through the current pandemic, according to Jason Hartschuh, OSU extension educator.
 Unless they are sick, farmers don’t usually tell their workers to stay home, but through keeping social distance on the farm and increasing many of our tried and true disinfection protocols, we can all stay healthy. One big difference is that instead of disinfecting our boots, we need to disinfect all surfaces around us and all our employees touch.

Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng has resumed training after a brief spell on the sidelines due to a muscular problem.
 Boateng suffered the knock in Bayern's 3-2 Champions League defeat at the hands of Rostov last week and missed the Bundesliga win over Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend.
 His return to Sabener Strasse means he is likely to feature in Friday's trip to Mainz as Bayern look to close the gap to leaders RB Leipzig.
 The newly promoted side are still unbeaten after 12 games and hold a three- point lead over Carlo Ancelotti's men.
 Robert Lewandowski took part in Tuesday's training session without any noteworthy problems after suffering a minor knee problem on Monday, while Javi Martinez also resumed regular training after spending Monday in the club's performance centre.
 Xabi Alonso, meanwhile, worked individually due to some minor physical discomforts.

 Father Vincent Michael O'Connor died on April 10, 2020 at Landmark Senior Living. He was 97 years old. Born July 19, 1922 and grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts, Father O'Connor was the son of Michael J. O'Connor and Delia O'Connor (Neilan). He was predeceased by his sister Lillian E. O'Connor who was his constant companion and traveling partner. She passed on June 1, 2001. His beloved brother James J. O'Connor passed on November 14, 1986 and sister-in-law Phyllis A. O'Connor passed July 25, 2010. He attended St. Anselm College in Manchester, NH, and studied for the priesthood at the Seminary of Philosophy and the Grand Seminary in Montreal, Canada. He was ordained a priest on January 24, 1948. After four years of parochial experience, Father O'Connor was assigned to graduate studies in Social Work at the Catholic University in Washington, D.C. where he received a Master of Science degree in Social Work. He gained professional field experience in Washington, Baltimore, and St. Louis. He then returned to the Springfield Diocese to establish both the Catholic Charities Agency and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. In 1975, he was appointed chairman of the Springfield Housing Board. In light of these capacities he served as diocesan representative on local, state, and national levels. Father O'Connor was Chairman of the Department of Social Work (which he established) at the College of Our Lady of the Elms in Chicopee, MA, from where he held an Honorary Doctorate, and taught at Boston College of Nursing. Simultaneous with these responsibilities, he functioned for over fourteen years as a Civilian Chaplain among the military at Westover Air Force Base; was Chaplain of the Westfield Detention Center for delinquent youth, and did rehabilitation counseling at the Springfield Municipal Hospital. In 1960, he chaired the Massachusetts State Committee that formulated standards for child caring institutions in the Commonwealth. Father O'Connor was a Charter Member of the National Association of Social Workers, a member of the Academy of Social Workers and was a former Board Member of the Massachusetts Conference of Social Welfare. In August of 1969 he was appointed pastor of St. Catherine's Parish in Leeds, MA. In addition to his parochial responsibilities he served as part-time Chaplain in caring for the Catholic patients of the Northampton Veterans Medical Center. On July 31, 2002, Father O'Connor retired to the Northampton area, and most recently at Landmark Senior Living. He is survived by his two beloved nieces Ellen and her husband Ted Borowski, and Alicia and her husband Joe Tyburski. Services for Father O'Connor will be private and held at the convenience of the family. Burial will take place in St. Patrick's Cemetery in Chicopee. A memorial mass will be announced at a later date. CZELUSNIAK FUNERAL HOME has been entrusted with arrangements. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Father O'Connor's memory to Pope Francis Preparatory School or to St. Anselm College.

Karim Benzema could be fit enough for a place in the Real Madrid starting XI for their derby clash with Atletico Madrid on Saturday, head coach Zinedine Zidane has revealed.
 Striker Benzema missed Madrid's last game before the international break - a 3-0 LaLiga win over Leganes - with a hip problem and was a doubt for this weekend's fixture at the Vicente Calderon.
 The Frenchman returned to training on Thursday and Zidane says he could be included from the start.
 "Benzema will be in the squad," he told a news conference. "He has recovered and I'm happy to have him back.
 "We'll have to wait and see if he's ready to play. If he's in the squad it means he could start.
 "Karim has been training well with his team-mates. We'll wait and see on Saturday if he will start."
 The availability of Benzema will plug the gap left by Alvaro Morata, who could miss up to a month with a hamstring injury picked up while on international duty with Spain.
 Morata initially sustained the issue in a World Cup qualifier against Macedonia last week, with Madrid reportedly furious he was allowed to play 26 minutes in a 2-2 friendly draw with England on Tuesday.
 However, Zidane is reluctant to point the finger.
 "These things can happen in football," he added. "I'm not going to blame anyone. We're upset with Alvaro's injury but these things can happen.
 "We just hope he makes a speedy recovery. We can't change the past.
 "It's easy now looking back. I don't know exactly what happened the other day. I'm sure everybody there that works in the backroom staff is professional and did their job. Now we have to be patient and look after Alvaro.
 "When players head off on international duty you hope they return with a clean bill of health, but the most important thing is that he makes a quick recovery. We have to focus on Saturday."
 Zidane also had positive news regarding the fitness of Sergio Ramos, who has been out since early October with a knee injury.
 "Sergio has been training well this week and we'll decide tomorrow how the team will line-up," he said.

That was the way one apartment dweller described what happened early Monday morning to a two-story building located near the mouth of Ell’s Branch on the Oneida Road that most people referred to as a type of landmark building in the community.
 The aftermath has left an elderly lady, Rosie Johnson, 84, listed in stable condition in the Memorial Hospital, suffering from second degree burns.
 Grubb became an overnight hero to the people of this tiny community located about eight miles north of Manchester on Ky. 11 by saving the woman’s life.
 After removing his family from the burning building, more commonly known as the L.F. Johnson Grocery, he managed to locate Johnson in her upstairs apartment and carry her from the building.
 Witnesses at the scene said the swift action by the man may have saved the woman’s life.
 Officials are still puzzled over what instigated the fire, and no one seems to be able to help them.
 “We have no idea where the fire started or what started it,” said Burning Springs Fire Chief Jim Westerfield, who’s crew was called to the scene at about 4:20 a.m. “Grubb doesn’t have any ideal what started it and we haven’t been able to talk to Mrs. Johnson.”
 “This was the type of fire where we couldn’t find any place that looked like the flames may have started, nor could we get to the flames to fight them,” the chief added.
 By daylight Tuesday, only the ashes could be seen at the place where many folks in the community had known over the years to be the Led Johnson Grocery.
 Rosie Johnson, L.F.’s wife, had lived in the store for at least the last 20 years and had continued to live there even after her husband passed away recently.
 “The bottom part of the building was a grocery operated by Alex Roberts, who incidently owned the whole building,” Westerfield said. “Apparently Grubb and his family, and the Johnson lady were the only two families living upstairs.”
 Little or no insurance was owned by any of the residents and Roberts reported to have a small amount on his store and contents.
 The L.F. Johnson place has been a long-time fixture in the community and recognizable landmark of its residents.
 “It is one that has been here a long time and I think everybody knew Led (Johnson), because folks still called it the L.F. Johnson place even after he died,” said Floyd Burt, a neighbor who was one of the first to report the fire.

West Ham boss Slaven Bilic has suggested that Jose Mourinho put himself in more serious trouble by kicking a water bottle too cleanly in his touchline tantrum last Sunday.
 The Manchester United manager has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association after he was sent to the stands by referee Jon Moss during the 1-1 Premier League draw with the Hammers at Old Trafford.
 Mourinho became incensed when Paul Pogba was booked for diving and kicked a bottle in frustration before Moss ordered him to leave the technical area.
 Bilic offered some sympathy towards his counterpart and felt that his clean connection made the offence unfortunately clear.
 "It was a great volley to be fair. He should have miskicked it - he hit it too well!" Bilic said ahead of the teams' EFL Cup quarter-final clash on Wednesday.
 "I have sympathy with him because of the situation with Pogba, it was a great decision from the referee but from our point of view it did not look like a dive.
 "Many times I have seen those bottles in front of me and many times I have gone to smash them and stopped in the last second."
 It is the second time Mourinho has been sent off this season and could land the 53-year-old with a stadium ban, as well as a significant fine.
 But Bilic believes the behaviour of managers in England is much more refined than in a number of other European nations.
 "I have been sent to the stands a couple of times, including once when I was at Besiktas in a game against Arsenal in the last minute of the [Champions League] play-off game - I gesticulated too much and the referee was Serbian so he understood me," said Bilic.
 "In Europe, in most stadiums the benches are far away from each other so we don't see each other. Here [in England] you are right next to each other and it is a dangerous situation because your state of mind is not normal. You are not sitting at home having lunch with your family - your adrenaline is going and you are in the red zone.
 "What I find really great in England is that I have never seen a fight between the managers. [Arsene] Wenger and Mourinho, the one they always show, is one in 15 years or so, so we are doing well."

I also love Brussels sprouts cut in half and roasted cut side down until the edges curl up.
 Any kind of squash or potato is easily roasted when cut into slabs or cubes and lightly coated with olive oil, salt, and fresh or dried herbs like rosemary and thyme. If the vegetables are small, like baby potatoes, they are best left whole so the outside can puff up and become crunchy, while the inside steams and becomes silky.
 Keep the food elevated in the oven so the hot air can rotate around it, and make sure every exposed surface is coated with olive oil so no moisture can escape.
 The cooking time will generally be 45 to 60 minutes, but will depend on the size and weight of the food. A small paring knife inserted in the center will tell you if the vegetable’s done. If the knife goes in as easily as into soft butter, and the outside is nicely browned, the food is done.
 Let the vegetables rest for a few minutes on the rack, and serve hot or at room temperature.
 As good as they are plain, roasted vegetables are even better with a finishing touch of flavor. Sprinkle with a bit of spice or fragrant olive oil, or brush on a bold vinaigrette to add a touch of acid and oil.
 Any leftover roasted vegetables are delicious the next day chopped and added to a salad, served as an antipasto platter at room temperature, or made into a sandwich.
