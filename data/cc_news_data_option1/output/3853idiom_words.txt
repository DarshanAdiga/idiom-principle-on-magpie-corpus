Dev also believes that the Hindi music industry provides a level playing field to everyone. "I believe in good work. Whoever does outstanding work will get an opportunity here, and there is nothing like 'I am a girl so I can't work in Bollywood' or 'people are not supporting me'. I think if I am doing good work, people will support me. It completely depends on the artiste as to how he/she is and how our work is.
 The composer, who has worked on three tracks in the upcoming Vikrant Massey and Yami Gautam-starrer Ginny Weds Sunny says that the makers of the movie loved her first scratches and that's how everything fell in place. "I was narrated the movie scene by the director Puneet Khanna, and it was a wedding scene song. I worked on the song along with lyricist Kunaal and sent the scratch to the movie team and they absolutely loved it. That's how it all fell in place. Plus, I have composed two more songs in this film one is Fir Chala with singer Jubin Nautiyal and another is recreational song Sawan which is a collaboration with Neha Kakkar, Badshah and Mika Singh.


 The Tum Hi Aana (Marjaavaan; 2019) composer says that even though she came from a small town, she was lucky enough to get projects to work on. "I moved to Mumbai quite early on in my career with my husband Aditya Dev. Honestly, my experience has been fair as everyone faces ups and down and has to work hard or struggle to get to a point but in all it was not that bad at all. I'm thankful to god for everything. It was a new experience coming into a new city and trying our luck, to achieve what I have dreamt about in life," she concludes.
