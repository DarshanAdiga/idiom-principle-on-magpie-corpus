Che tasto dolente. Io sono di Reggio Calabria, ma ho vissuto all'estero e poi sono tornato a casa. E la prima cosa da dire e che il tasso di giovani che se ne vanno dalla Regione oggi e piu alto rispetto a quelli che se ne andavano in Germania, a Torino o Milano negli anni Cinquanta, gli anni del dopoguerra. Due giovani su tre, di fatto, lasciano la loro casa. Come si fa a bloccare questa emorragia? Il problema e che si perde troppo tempo a cercare di capire perche i giovani se ne vanno invece di offrire subito proposte concrete affinche non lo facciano. È inutile stare li a cercare le cause. Mettiamo in atto soluzioni. Ogni volta che laureo un ragazzo con 110 e lode e come se gli dessi un passaporto per andare via. Allora ecco parliamo delle universita. Diamo ai giovani borse di studio e di ricerca. Investiamo in cose concrete. Ci sono tante eccellenze: all'Universita di Rende per esempio, in provincia di Cosenza. La facolta di ingegneria e una delle migliori d'Italia tanto che una multinazionale giapponese che sviluppa software ha investito in questa universita e dato lavoro ai nostri giovani. Non ha investito a Torino o Milano. Ma a Cosenza. Il sistema sanitario non funziona bene, e allora perche non assumiamo medici e infermieri? Queste sono misure che si possono applicare subito. O ancora, non abbiamo piu assistenti sociali ma tanti ragazzi che sono pronti e hanno le competenze per fare questo lavoro. Li teniamo fermi? La spesa e piccolissima rispetto ad un obiettivo grande.

BROCKTON - Seeing no other way out, an elderly Brockton man jumped from a second floor landing into the bushes below to escape a house fire that broke out early Tuesday morning, according to the Fire Department.
 Brockton firefighters responded to a house fire just after 3 a.m. at 11 Field St., a two-story home on the north side of the city. Deputy Chief Brian Nardelli said when firefighters arrived, there was smoke coming out of the back of the building, and a glow from the second floor. As they made their way up to the second floor, a deputy out front noticed a shadow, which was the elderly man on the second floor, who crawled out a window onto a landing and then quickly jumped down into some bushes, Nardelli said.
 "The other people were able to escape. He was unable to, so he did jump out," Nardelli said.
 It's not clear if the man could have found another way out, Nardelli said, and firefighters didn't have a chance to extend a ladder to him or otherwise get him off the landing before he jumped.
 The elderly man and a woman were taken to Good Samaritan Medical Center for evaluation and potential treatment. The elderly man was hobbling a bit after the fall, Nardelli said, so there were concerns that he could have suffered a low-extremity injury, but it didn't appear to be a life-threatening injury. The woman "took some smoke" to the lungs, Nardelli said.
 They were among a total of five occupants in the building, including three adults and two children, Nardelli said.
 The fire was quickly knocked down and confined to a second floor bedroom, Nardelli said.
 The cause of the fire that is suspected to be the overheating of extension cord wire used to power a space heater, Nardelli said. The fire caused $75,000 in damages to the building, Nardelli said.
 The Brockton fire deputy credited the firefighters from Squad A company that responded for putting the fire out so quickly, preventing it from spreading to other areas of the home.
 "They did an unbelievable job," Nardelli said. "They were able to contain it to the room. There was pretty good heat on second floor when we got there. We were able to attack it and knock it down quick. That's the big thing. Once it's out of the room, you're off to the races throughout the whole house."

Now, that doesn't mean he didn't impress in any way. He put on a show during the Home Run Derby, as you might recall, and made contact at an uncanny rate for such a young hitter. He also authored some of the hardest hit balls in all the majors. But his average exit velocity was suspect and his average launch angle downright sad. The problem is he's getting drafted like none of it happened, which might make sense if we were working with a weakened hitter pool and had to scour every nook and cranny for upside, but we're clearly not. In fact, third base is so deep that No. 15 in my rankings, Josh Donaldson, actually had higher point-per-game average last year than No. 7, Eugenio Suarez, so there are just redundancies all over.
 Guerrero will eventually be a star, and maybe he improves his launch angle in Year 2 the way Juan Soto did and takes off. But it's unnecessary risk at a position where you can't go wrong waiting.

ROCKLAND -- People dealing with Parkinson's Disease, their loved ones and caregivers dressed to the nines, snapped photos on a red carpet and worked the dance floor at a special event geared toward them on Friday night.
 The event, called "Parkie Prom," was organized by 110 Fitness, a gym that focuses on programming that's inclusive to Parkinson's patients and people with other disabilities.
 "The camaraderie is great. Everybody is great. It's like having a whole separate family," said Dennis Sproul of Hanover, a member of the gym who attended Friday's event.
 Parkinson's affects the nervous system and can cause tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, difficulty with speech and frequent falls, among other symptoms.
 Brett Miller, owner of 110 Fitness, said the gym is an "all-inclusive" space, and the largest one in the world that caters specifically to people with Parkinson's.
 "Our mission is that we don't leave anyone behind," he said. "No matter what your disability or ability is, everyone is welcome here."
 The gym offers a boxing program specifically geared toward Parkinson's patients, along with other programs that include cycling, yoga, tai chi, and strength and conditioning workouts. The gym also has programs for other disadvantaged groups, including disabled youths and adults, veterans and women who have survived domestic violence.
 The prom was also a fundraiser for the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organization named for an Olympic cyclist diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's that funds research into the disease and connects those suffering from Parkinson's with various resources.
 Miller said the event was a chance for members to get dressed up and have fun in a way they don't usually get to do. Volunteers chipped in to help with every aspect of the event, he said. The food, drinks and a DJ set were all donated. Hairdressers from two local salons, Cove Hair in Scituate and Dahlia Salon in Cohasset, volunteered to do hair and makeup before the event, and volunteers brought in dozens of prom dresses for gym members to wear, he said.
 "We have what's like a huge family here. It's a big community," he said.
 On Friday night, the lights in the gym were dimmed, a disco ball sent colorful light bouncing of the walls and a DJ set up in the boxing ring filled the room with oldies tunes. Near the entrance, a red carpet awaited guests as they arrived, in suits and long dresses.
 Jim Murphy of Cohasset was there with his wife, Pat Murphy, and Ellie Devine of Marshfield, a friend who volunteers at the gym during boxing classes. He said his workouts at the gym have helped him regain some of his balance. Loss of balance is a frequent Parkinson's symptom.
 The gym is a supportive place, where members encourage each other to reach their personal fitness goals, he said.
 "Everybody celebrates everybody else's victories," like when a friend is able to complete a new exercise, he said. His goal is to be able to start golfing again this year, a target he said he's confident he can hit, in part because of his workouts at 110 Fitness.
 Devine volunteers as a "cornerman" during boxing sessions, supporting the gym members as they hit the bags.
 "It's such a positive attitude in here," she said. "It's an absolutely joyful place to be."
 A whiteboard in the gym is covered with members' goals for the year. One person's goal is to touch their toes. Another wants to run a 10 mile race.
 "Fear less, trust more" wrote another.

MIDDLEBORO -- Reece Marcal has the skills required to be a go-to player on the court for the Middleboro High boys basketball team.
 But the one asset Marcal lacks is completely out of his control as he doesn't come close to possessing the prototypical size of a game-changer. It hasn't mattered, though.
 Marcal packages his supreme talent inside of a 5-foot-7, 135-pound frame, and despite his clear height disadvantage, the senior guard continuously overcomes what others may think is a limitation by raising his game to another level for the Sachems.
 "The kid's talent is undeniable, but what makes him different is he's so undersized," said first-year Middleboro coach Michael Duarte. "It's a constant battle."
 A battle Marcal has shown he can win more often than not. Even when he was a few inches shorter, Marcal made an impact for Middleboro with his quickness on drives and lights-out shooting.
 In his first career start as a sophomore, Marcal led a win over East Bridgewater with 21 points, and never left the starting lineup. He could never fully shed the tag of being an undersized guard, but as he poured in points by the truckload, it became less of his identity.
 "It doesn't really faze me," said Marcal, who has blossomed into a top-10 scorer in the South Shore League this season. "I feel like I'm small out there because everybody's got three, four inches on me. I use my speed and everything like that to try to get even with everybody."
 While Marcal has produced some lofty scoring figures in his career, nothing compared to the performance he put together on Jan. 10, again against East Bridgewater.
 Marcal got going with a couple easy baskets before racking up points in bunches such that once he got over 20, Marcal lost track of his point total.
 He continued to stay within himself and the offense, though, but he was in such an elevated zone that his teammates kept feeding him the ball. During his offensive eruption, Marcel caught fire from beyond the arc by sinking 9 of 11 3-pointers. By the time he made his way to the bench with a couple minutes remaining and the Sachems comfortably in the lead, Marcal found out he torched the Vikings for 40 points.
 For Marcal, it was a vindication of sorts for anyone whoever said his height would get in the way and it served as the best scoring output from a Sachem in more than 25 years.
 "I woke up that day and I was like, 'I got to do something because I've been too average this season,'" Marcal said. "I kept hitting threes and I was like, 'I don't know how I'm doing this.' It just kind of happened. I couldn't believe it."
 Duarte wasn't surprised by Marcal's offensive outburst as the prolific scorer filled the role he has carved out for himself.
 "His job is to score," Duarte said. "He's a kid when all else fails we know we can get Reece the ball and he's going to probably be able to put it in."
 Marcal didn't obtain a career performance on talent alone. Marcel plays with a determination that has always been there and he uses it to his advantage to propel him past opponents who are bigger and stronger.
 "There's no doubt he plays with an edge," Duarte said. "Not a mean streak, but he always played with a chip on his shoulder because he's the smallest kid in the gym."
 Marcal's high rate of production hasn't happened by accident. He put in arduous work to develop into a sharpshooter and playmaker that gives him the ability to score in abundance.
 Marcal has also displayed the leadership of a veteran player, buying into Duarte's systems and philosophies to help lay the groundwork to get the program moving in a positive direction as the Sachems, who are currently 3-10, haven't made a postseason appearance since 2009.
 "He's made my job as a first-year varsity coach here a thousand times easier," Duarte said. "If your best player is willing to commit and do the little things, then your 12th man better be willing to commit and do the little things."
 Marcal is just one of three seniors who have spent all four years in the program, witnessing the ups and mostly downs throughout the past few seasons. But Marcal has given it his all no matter the situation. Not having a height advantage at any time in his career already forced him to do that.
 Marcal will always be an undersized guard, but as he has shown, he's much more than that.
 "I put so much into this program," Marcal said. "I'm dedicated. It might not be the best four years of high school basketball, obviously, but I love basketball. I love playing. Senior year, had to show out."

Because they are starting from scratch, many of them do not view their practices as adapting, we learned. Rather, they see these techniques as central elements of a new kind of ranching.

On education, Sawyerr believes we should be looking beyond brick and mortar schools and curriculum designed for a pervious age and instead, “encourage curriculum that emphasizes STEM education, leveraging the internet and virtual based education approaches to augment face to face interactions, and in some cases eliminate the need for face to face instruction entirely.” Companies such as the Africa Blockchain Alliance are dedicated to improving this and have trained close to 50 engineers in 2019 via the Africa Blockchain Developer Program with Consensys Academy. “We've also done many non-tech blockchain education sessions for various groups across the continent. Such efforts for tech and non-tech training on blockchain need to be scaled up,” notes Onuoha.

TELLING STORIES
 Nelson and La Vaque, veterans on press row at the State Hockey Tournament, were quick to find how little they actually knew.
 With every interview came about new facts, new angles to tell.
 "I was a high school kid in the 80s, loving every second of the tournament. Going to it was the greatest thing in my life. It was the State Fair, the Fourth of July and Christmas all rolled into one," Nelson said.
 It came down to crafting what happened on and off the ice at the tournament into interesting stories.
 "You get behind the scenes with (famed coach) Willard Ikola, talking with the coaches, the players, about what happened in the locker room, on the bus, in hotel rooms, and you're like, 'wow, there's a lot of drama.' That's what the book is. We're just telling stories," Nelson said.
 The book, set to be released to the public in February, can be pre-ordered at the Minnesota Historical Society website. _Tourney Time_ also has its own website, where additional stories left out of the book as well as interviews and other factual information, are being released.

Pham is that disciplined sort of hitter who normally wins my undying affection, and longtime readers may remember he's _the one_ I hyped to the hills during draft prep season just a couple short years ago. But I don't like the way things are trending for Pham, and it's easy to overlook, given his late start, that he'll be 32 on opening day. Once a player enters his 30s, he's at risk of rapid regression, sometimes without warning. So when there _is_ warning, we need to take it seriously.
 In an environment where fly balls seem to turn into home runs at random because the drag on the ball is so low, the players most at risk of being left behind are the ones who don't elevate. Pham was never great at this, but he has taken steps back the past two years, to the point his ground-ball rate was fourth-highest in baseball last year. That's Eric Hosmer territory. Add that he also had a career-worst barrel rate, and it's fair to ask how much longer home runs will be part of his skill set. He's obviously going to run less as he gets older, too. Shave a handful off those home run and stolen base totals, and there's not a lot separating Pham from, like, Brett Gardner.
