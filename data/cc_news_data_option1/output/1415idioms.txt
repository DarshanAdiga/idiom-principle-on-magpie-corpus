Dr. Leigh Vinocur, spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians, told ProPublica that coupled with PPE shortages, the highly contagious virus can force hospitals into a difficult calculus. “Of course, we want to do what’s best for the patient, and in this situation we have to cut corners that we wouldn’t usually,” she said. “But the alternatives are losing half your workforce. Using all your resources on one patient, doing everything, everything, using all your PPE.”

It would be 23 years before I'd ask again, in the summer of 2015, when I was writing a book on Apollo 8 and visited the Lovells in their Chicago home. By that time, the movie was 20 years old, the mission had been redeemed in the public mind and Lovell's depiction by Tom Hanks, as well as his time on the speech-making circuit, had secured him a spot on the Rushmore of astronauts, along with other names like Armstrong and Glenn and Gagarin. The speeches had paid well too, allowing Lovell to build his oldest son, who is a chef, his own restaurant. In Lovell's living room on that July day in 2015, he was much more reflective than he'd been when I'd bulled ahead with the same question in 1992.

The couple first met after the Civil War when a penniless Isidor Straus moved to New York City, according to Premier Exhibitions. Isidor and his brother later acquired Macy's, and he eventually became a powerful businessman and a member of the US House of Representatives.
 According to Today, Straus was offered a spot on a lifeboat while the ship was sinking. He declined, saying he wouldn't board a raft until every woman and child had gotten off the ship.
 Ida then refused to leave her husband. When her husband urged her to evacuate the ship, she reportedly responded, "We have lived together for many years. Where you go, I go."
 Ida then ordered her maid to board a lifeboat. She also gave her a mink coat, quipping that she wouldn't need the garment anymore. The couple was last seen together on the deck of the Titanic. Isidor's body was recovered from the ocean, but Ida was never found.
 Woodlawn Cemetary in the Bronx memorialized Isidor and Ida Straus with a cenotaph bearing a line from the Song of Solomon: "Many waters cannot quench love --neither can the floods drown it."

“It appears to be out of line and extreme and clearly in violation, a blatant violation, of our fundamental rights,” said state Senate President Susan Wagle of Wichita, an abortion opponent. Wagle questioned why abortion clinics remained open, while churches faced restrictions.

"I hope people will draw the value of family from all of this. You get kind of mundane and stuck in a rut of trying to get here, go there. Sometimes it pulls the family apart. I think the coolest thing about this quarantine is, it has put the family back together," she said. "I think families will be able to instill dinner time and dinner conversations where they weren't able to do that before because of the things they committed to.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The OPEC oil cartel and nations including Russia have agreed to boost oil prices by cutting as much as 10 million barrels a day in production, or a tenth of global supply. More countries, including the United States, were discussing Friday their own cuts in what would be an unprecedented global pact to stabilize the market.The agreement between OPEC and partner countries aims to cut 10 million barrels per day until July, then 8 million barrels per day through the end of the year, and 6 million a day for 16 months beginning in 2021.Mexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said Friday that he had agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.S. will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.That paves the way for cuts that experts estimate could reach 15 million barrels a day in all - about 15% of world production. Such a move would be unprecedented both in its size and the number of participating countries, many of whom have long been bitter rivals in the energy industry.The price of crude is down by over 50% since the start of the year and while that helps consumers and energy-hungry businesses, it is below the cost of production for many countries and companies. That has strained the budgets of oil-producing nations, many of which are developing economies, and it has pushed private companies in the U.S. toward bankruptcy.Analysts warn even these proposed cuts may not be enough to offset the loss in demand over the longer term, as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated demand for energy around the world.“COVID-19 is an unseen beast that seems to be impacting everything in its path,” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said at the start of the meeting, according to a statement. “There is a grizzly shadow hanging over all of us. We do not want this shadow to envelope us. It will have a crushing and long-term impact on the entire industry.”One breakthrough came after Mexico relented in its opposition to the deal, in which it was being asked to cut its output by 400,000 barrels a day. Mexican President Obrador said his country will instead cut its production by 100,000 barrels per day from its current level of 1.7 million barrels a day. The U.S. will add a cut of 250,000 barrels per day to what it has already agreed.More nations were expected to add to the effort, with Saudi Arabia chairing a Group of 20 virtual meeting of energy ministers on Friday to discuss the oversupply in the market.The meeting is expected to bring onboard a wider number of countries, including the United States. Saudi media quoted Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as saying in his opening remarks that the pandemic means it is more vital than ever that reliable and affordable energy supplies are available. The meeting also includes representatives of OPEC.Trump has spoken earlier with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia about the negotiations. The United States is interested in a deal because the oil price crash has caused thousands of job losses in the oil patch just as the virus outbreak is causing a record spike in unemployment.“There’s so much production nobody even knows what to do with it, that’s how it’s working,” Trump said at a White House news briefing.The oil market was already oversupplied when Russia and OPEC failed to agree on output cuts in early March. Analysts say Russia refused to back even a moderate cut because it would have only served to help U.S. energy companies that were pumping at full capacity. Stalling would hurt American shale-oil producers and protect market share.Russia’s move enraged Saudi Arabia, which not only said it would not cut production on its own but said it would increase output instead and reduce its selling prices in what became effectively a global pricing war.In the time since, prices have collapsed as the coronavirus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have largely halted global travel. International benchmark Brent crude traded Friday over $31 a barrel while the U.S. benchmark West Texas crude traded under $23.Russia relies on oil as the main source of income and the price collapse caused the ruble to crash. That boosted the cost of imports and sped up inflation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin views “very positively” the result of the negotiations and added that Russia welcomes Mexico’s decision to join the deal.The agreement is a win for everyone, the world’s economy would have “plunged into chaos” if the deal had been broken off, Peskov added.Analysts warn the proposed 10 million barrel per day cut for May and June will not be enough to offset plummeting demand for oil globally and runs the risk of coming too late as storage capacity for oil nears its maximum. Even if North American producers took 5 million barrels a day off the market, there could still be an excess supply of 5-10 million barrels per day.Research firm Rystad Energy estimates the imbalance for April is 27.4 million barrels per day. The firm says global storage of crude is already close to being filled to the brim, estimating that on average 79% of the world’s oil storage capacity is already full. Around 7.4 billion barrels of crude and products are in storage, including 1.3 billion currently on board tankers at sea.Chris Midgley, global head of analytics for S&amp;P Global Platts, said the proposed cuts are unlikely to have any significant impact on April supply, and thus run the risk of getting close to exhausting all available storage in May.However, a cut of 10-15 million barrels per day is enough to prop up oil prices and helps to reduce strain on crude storage facilities, analysts said.___Associated Press writers Daria Litvinova and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Cathy Bussewitz in New York, Aya Batrawy in Dubai and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

After the summer ends, when the season officially “begins,” practices are more than just a two-hour get-together. For coaches, it’s getting there early, setting up, running the practice and then waiting while the kids drive home or get picked up, which isn’t always on time. The same goes for games, with the time spent playing representing just a piece of the time coaches invest in them.
 Before those games ever begin, coaches have earned their paychecks and more. So, you can imagine the disbelief when the idea was floated that coaches might not receive the second half (supplemental pay is divided into two pay installments) of their spring payout.
 To the layman, I understand the simple math of “there are no games, thus no pay needed,” but it’s just not that simple. The work was already put in before the postponements hit last month.
 If that’s not enough, coaches have remained in communication with their players, encouraging continued physical activity and offering support for the new virtual learning environment. Student-athletes often look to their coaches as sources of accountability, and that hasn’t changed just because the games have stopped.
 At the end of the day, the Board of Education made the right decision to pay the remaining supplements to spring coaches. Whether or not it was ever a real debate is left to the members, who understandably held the meeting on Zoom without public comment due to the COVID-19 restrictions.
 Coaches make little money for what they do as it is. They do it for the love of the game and for love of the kids. There isn’t a long line of people waiting to take those jobs either.
 Let’s take care of the ones we have.

One of the interviewees was Mike Ferguson, a 38-year-old Los Angeles resident who went from having a Bernie or bust attitude to saying that Biden most likely has his vote in November. Ferguson told the Daily Beast, “At the end of the day, I will probably end up voting for him…. I look at this like an addiction. We have to look at this like harm reduction. The only thing that will feel right to me is we have to get Trump out of office.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The OPEC oil cartel and nations including Russia have agreed to boost oil prices by cutting as much as 10 million barrels a day in production, or a tenth of global supply. More countries, including the United States, were discussing Friday their own cuts in what would be an unprecedented global pact to stabilize the market.The agreement between OPEC and partner countries aims to cut 10 million barrels per day until July, then 8 million barrels per day through the end of the year, and 6 million a day for 16 months beginning in 2021.Mexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said Friday that he had agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.S. will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.That paves the way for cuts that experts estimate could reach 15 million barrels a day in all - about 15% of world production. Such a move would be unprecedented both in its size and the number of participating countries, many of whom have long been bitter rivals in the energy industry.The price of crude is down by over 50% since the start of the year and while that helps consumers and energy-hungry businesses, it is below the cost of production for many countries and companies. That has strained the budgets of oil-producing nations, many of which are developing economies, and it has pushed private companies in the U.S. toward bankruptcy.Analysts warn even these proposed cuts may not be enough to offset the loss in demand over the longer term, as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated demand for energy around the world.“COVID-19 is an unseen beast that seems to be impacting everything in its path,” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said at the start of the meeting, according to a statement. “There is a grizzly shadow hanging over all of us. We do not want this shadow to envelope us. It will have a crushing and long-term impact on the entire industry.”One breakthrough came after Mexico relented in its opposition to the deal, in which it was being asked to cut its output by 400,000 barrels a day. Mexican President Obrador said his country will instead cut its production by 100,000 barrels per day from its current level of 1.7 million barrels a day. The U.S. will add a cut of 250,000 barrels per day to what it has already agreed.More nations were expected to add to the effort, with Saudi Arabia chairing a Group of 20 virtual meeting of energy ministers on Friday to discuss the oversupply in the market.The meeting is expected to bring onboard a wider number of countries, including the United States. Saudi media quoted Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as saying in his opening remarks that the pandemic means it is more vital than ever that reliable and affordable energy supplies are available. The meeting also includes representatives of OPEC.Trump has spoken earlier with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia about the negotiations.

Al is also survived by many nieces and nephews, including Heather Dix, his niece and goddaughter with whom he shared a special relationship.                                                                                                                            Several cousins also survive, including Rusty Haganah, whom Al considered a brother. Al is also survived by his 9 year old yellow lab, Bullet, who he loved to take hunting.                                                                                                                            He was preceded in death by his parents, his adoptive mother, Carol Sue Dix, and his father-in-law, Lawrence Vaupel, Sr.                                                                                                                            Al retired from Heart Technologies, Inc. as their Chief Financial Officer in June of 2019.

His faith in God was strong and an inspiration to many and he lived life to the fullest. Al was a devoted Chicago Cubs fan, and loved fishing, gardening, and hunting, especially with his special friends in Meredosia, IL. He was blessed with many lifelong friends and was loved by everyone who knew him. His family meant everything to him and he was always there to lend a hand to anyone who needed him.

OUR VIEW Cities and states not being being able to rely on assistance from the federal government — the entity to which Americans send their tax dollars every year — is disheartening, to say the least, and that is doubly true for the nation’s health-care-delivery network, which according to doctors, nurses and other hospital personnel serving on the front lines is teetering on the verge of collapse.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Authorities warned Rhode Islanders on Friday to wear masks, gather only in groups of five or fewer people and keep their distance from each other as they increasingly venture outdoors. State environmental police said they'll be monitoring fishing areas, bike paths and management areas that are still open to the public to make sure people observe strict social distancing rules. Department of Environmental Protection chief Janet Coit said officers will issue citations to violators. “During this critical time when we’re all longing to get outside for some fresh air and physical activity, I encourage people to enjoy the outdoors close to home by taking a walk around the block or spending time in their backyards,” Coit said in a statement. “And for those who plan to go fishing or biking this weekend, we ask that you keep your distance from others and engage in these activities by yourself or with members of your immediate family,\" she added. Rhode Island’s trout fishing season opens this weekend, but with limits designed to eliminate crowds and contain the coronavirus outbreak. Environmental police also urged residents to properly dispose of masks and gloves. The department said it has fielded numerous complaints of people tossing protective items on the ground.

The annual Good Friday Appeal for the Royal Children's Hospital has raised $18.2 million after the Victorian government threw it a lifeline.


  Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced on Friday his government would make up the shortfall between what was raised this year and last year's total, which was $18 million.


  The final total raised was $18.2 million, organisers said.


  "The total is something all Victorians should be proud of, especially under such trying circumstances," Good Friday Appeal executive director Anne Randall said in the statement late on Friday.


  "It is incredible to see the community continuing to rally together - virtually - and raise funds for children in need."


  The appeal relied this year on a "virtual tin shake" in place of volunteers in public collecting in-person donations.


  Earlier on Friday evening Mr Andrews said the state could not watch the appeal fall short this year.


  "The Good Friday Appeal supports the neediest kids - kids that are sick - and their families, every year, and we can't leave the kids short this year," he told Channel 7.


  At 8pm on Friday the donation tally was at nearly $7.2 million.


  Donations help the hospital care for children like Quinnie Westwood, the face of this year's campaign.


  Quinnie was born unable to breathe and had kidney failure, before undergoing surgery at age two to get her grandfather's kidney.


  The youngster is now six years old and despite the challenges faced since birth, including having to take anti-rejection medication, she makes her parents proud of how far she has come.


  As well as patient care, donations go towards equipment, technology, research and training.


  This year marks the 150th year for the Royal Children's Hospital.

I got into journalism because I thought I could make a difference. I wanted to right wrongs, fight for the little guy, root out government corruption, dig deep into conspiracies and cover-ups. I knew it would never really be a lucrative career, but I didn’t care. I wanted my work to have purpose, to contribute to society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And because my skills in math and science are laughable, I chose to become a journalist where my skills are merely functional. And it’s been a lot of fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Over the years, one of the most impressive things about working in a newsroom is watching it respond to a crisis. This one has been no different. In fact, in my 25 years as a journalist here, it’s probably been the finest example of how indispensable a newspaper can be. If ever there was a time when the people of this community could be proud of their local newspaper, now is that time.

It is expedient, I suppose, to lie in litigation if you crossed an intersection through a red light. You can lie and say it was a green light and that changes the legal outcome of your case. And that's the way Trump operates. But he would go beyond that because he would say the heck with you and the horse you rode in on as he did in the House impeachment inquiry. Then, he denounced Adam Schiff and denounced Jerry Nadler and denounced the witnesses. He tried to subvert the whole proceeding by denouncing the whistleblower and by showing that those people who lined up against him were of low character and were themselves liars.

The next step would be setting a schedule for the reopening of all now-closed businesses no later than June 1. That may not seem to jibe with county health officials’ projections of how long the virus may stay active in our region, but by that time if businesses are not back up and running, we may all face a problem just as big and overwhelming as the threat of contracting COVID-19.

In one of the cases that I describe in the book, he got wind of the fact that a small business, a travel agency conducted by father and daughter in Baldwin, Long Island, was using the name Trump Travel. Not Donald Trump Travel, but Trump Travel. They used Trump Travel because they were selling a bridge tours for people who play bridge, and “trump” is a bridge term. Also, like “Ace Hardware,” they thought “Trump” keynoted excellence. This was a little storefront travel agency in a small Long Island community. Trump had never been in the travel business and he never had any business involvement in Long Island, but he sued them. And at the end of the day, they were allowed to continue to use the name Trump Travel, but it had to make the lettering a little smaller. And they'd exhausted their life savings in defending the case. So he was quite sadistic about the way he went about it.

Vietnam will resume rice exports from this month, a government statement said on Friday, after the government last month announced a ban on rice exports to make sure the country has sufficient food to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has approved a plan by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to export 400,000 tonnes of rice in April, according to the statement seen by Reuters.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Phuc told the ministry to work out another plan for exports in May and submit it to the government by April 25, the statement said.

Chris Wilder hailed Billy Sharp as ‘Mr Sheffield United’ after the striker stepped off the bench to grab a late leveller at Bournemouth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    United’s Premier League return looked set to end in disappointment following Chris Mepham’s first goal for the Cherries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But boyhood Blades fan Sharp, top scorer during last season’s promotion-winning season, scrambled an 88th-minute equaliser following a free-kick to force a deserved 1-1 draw at the Vitality Stadium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “He was always going to come on when we you’re chasing the game but I thought the contribution of all the players was outstanding,” Blades boss Wilder said of 33-year-old Sharp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We were bold in terms of trying to get back in the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We felt that it was coming and we were nice and bright on a free-kick.

The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors received long-range projections on the coronavirus, and members did not like what they saw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    County health officials have come up with some best guesses, based on federal modeling, that indicate rules about safe-distancing, mask-wearing and other personal safety measures may have to stay in place into next fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Board members also exchanged ideas on how they believe the pandemic may play out locally, and that segued into discussion about the dangers of keeping businesses closed vs. the protection of county residents’ health and welfare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Fourth District Supervisor Peter Adam worries about the economic ramifications of keeping the local businesses in lockdown through the summer months and into the fall, and said this: “The economic impacts of this are getting overwhelmed by the health impacts of this. If we go all the way out to Nov. 1, a lot of people are going to be hurt without getting sick.”

Well first, don’t go into desperation mode. That is the one thing that I’m not crazy about: the government constantly telling people how long this lockdown is going to last. Why? It causes anxiety for people. Many start to stress and when you stress it can lead to panic. Panic is NEVER a good thing because you can impulse buy. You rush to the grocery store and start purchasing everything off the shelf you think you need, but a vast majority of it will go to waste.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The OPEC oil cartel and nations including Russia have agreed to boost oil prices by cutting as much as 10 million barrels a day in production, or a tenth of global supply. More countries, including the United States, were discussing Friday their own cuts in what would be an unprecedented global pact to stabilize the market.The agreement between OPEC and partner countries aims to cut 10 million barrels per day until July, then 8 million barrels per day through the end of the year, and 6 million a day for 16 months beginning in 2021.Mexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said Friday that he had agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.S. will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.That paves the way for cuts that experts estimate could reach 15 million barrels a day in all - about 15% of world production. Such a move would be unprecedented both in its size and the number of participating countries, many of whom have long been bitter rivals in the energy industry.The price of crude is down by over 50% since the start of the year and while that helps consumers and energy-hungry businesses, it is below the cost of production for many countries and companies. That has strained the budgets of oil-producing nations, many of which are developing economies, and it has pushed private companies in the U.S. toward bankruptcy.Analysts warn even these proposed cuts may not be enough to offset the loss in demand over the longer term, as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated demand for energy around the world.“COVID-19 is an unseen beast that seems to be impacting everything in its path,” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said at the start of the meeting, according to a statement. “There is a grizzly shadow hanging over all of us. We do not want this shadow to envelope us. It will have a crushing and long-term impact on the entire industry.”One breakthrough came after Mexico relented in its opposition to the deal, in which it was being asked to cut its output by 400,000 barrels a day. Mexican President Obrador said his country will instead cut its production by 100,000 barrels per day from its current level of 1.7 million barrels a day. The U.S. will add a cut of 250,000 barrels per day to what it has already agreed.More nations were expected to add to the effort, with Saudi Arabia chairing a Group of 20 virtual meeting of energy ministers on Friday to discuss the oversupply in the market.The meeting is expected to bring onboard a wider number of countries, including the United States. Saudi media quoted Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as saying in his opening remarks that the pandemic means it is more vital than ever that reliable and affordable energy supplies are available. The meeting also includes representatives of OPEC.Trump has spoken earlier with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia about the negotiations. The United States is interested in a deal because the oil price crash has caused thousands of job losses in the oil patch just as the virus outbreak is causing a record spike in unemployment.“There’s so much production nobody even knows what to do with it, that’s how it’s working,” Trump said at a White House news briefing.The oil market was already oversupplied when Russia and OPEC failed to agree on output cuts in early March. Analysts say Russia refused to back even a moderate cut because it would have only served to help U.S. energy companies that were pumping at full capacity. Stalling would hurt American shale-oil producers and protect market share.Russia’s move enraged Saudi Arabia, which not only said it would not cut production on its own but said it would increase output instead and reduce its selling prices in what became effectively a global pricing war.In the time since, prices have collapsed as the coronavirus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have largely halted global travel. International benchmark Brent crude traded Friday over $31 a barrel while the U.S. benchmark West Texas crude traded under $23.Russia relies on oil as the main source of income and the price collapse caused the ruble to crash. That boosted the cost of imports and sped up inflation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin views “very positively” the result of the negotiations and added that Russia welcomes Mexico’s decision to join the deal.The agreement is a win for everyone, the world’s economy would have “plunged into chaos” if the deal had been broken off, Peskov added.Analysts warn the proposed 10 million barrel per day cut for May and June will not be enough to offset plummeting demand for oil globally and runs the risk of coming too late as storage capacity for oil nears its maximum. Even if North American producers took 5 million barrels a day off the market, there could still be an excess supply of 5-10 million barrels per day.Research firm Rystad Energy estimates the imbalance for April is 27.4 million barrels per day. The firm says global storage of crude is already close to being filled to the brim, estimating that on average 79% of the world’s oil storage capacity is already full. Around 7.4 billion barrels of crude and products are in storage, including 1.3 billion currently on board tankers at sea.Chris Midgley, global head of analytics for S&amp;P Global Platts, said the proposed cuts are unlikely to have any significant impact on April supply, and thus run the risk of getting close to exhausting all available storage in May.However, a cut of 10-15 million barrels per day is enough to prop up oil prices and helps to reduce strain on crude storage facilities, analysts said.___Associated Press writers Daria Litvinova and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Cathy Bussewitz in New York, Aya Batrawy in Dubai and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

VALLETTA, Malta (AP) -- Malta has brought to its shores 70 migrants who drifted into Maltese waters after being stranded at sea for five days, but said Thursday that it must suspend further rescues due to the COVID-19 emergency.

I don’t know. He goes on to say that food is essential, but you’ll never see a grocery store giving away loaves of bread. Police are essential, but you’ll never see officers patrolling the streets without expecting a paycheck (and they absolutely should be paid for their work).

I know it’s super easy for me, a person who is employed, to sit here and say that when others around the country aren't as lucky. But when I look back at how my news organization responded to this and how it stepped up to help its community, I think I’m going to be proud of The Free Press.

The bill, in part, will require backers of ballot initiatives to submit more petition signatures before triggering Florida Supreme Court reviews that play a critical role in determining whether initiatives go before voters. The bill also will allow county supervisors of elections to charge more to verify petition signatures and will require all proposed constitutional amendments — including those placed on the ballot by the Legislature — to have statements about the potential impact on the state budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    During the legislative session, Republican lawmakers said the bill could help prevent fraud in the initiative process and argued that it should be difficult to amend the state Constitution.

SB 1794 does exactly that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Meanwhile, the sales-tax holidays signed Wednesday by DeSantis are part of a tax package (HB 7097) expected to reduce state and local revenues next fiscal year by $47.7 million, according to a staff analysis.

A man with COVID-19 was recently admitted to a third hospital in Brooklyn and asked a doctor how long it was before he could leave. Before her shift ended, the doctor told him that he required oxygen, and he’d need a few days to recover. When she returned to work the next morning, she learned that the patient had taken a turn for the worse. He was on a high-concentration oxygen mask, at 15 liters per minute, the last step before intubation for COVID-19 patients.

Attacking the BJP and its leader Kirit Somaiya over his allegations regarding the permission given to scam accused Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan to travel during the lockdown, the Congress on Friday alleged that the DHFL promoters were "main donors" of the NDA constituent. Seeking to turn the tables on the BJP and Somaiya, Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said Principal Secretary (Special) for Home Amitabh Gupta, who gave permission to the Wadhawans to travel to Mahabaleshwar from Khandala, was appointed by the previous Devendra Fadnavis regime in the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Sawant also said it cannot be ruled out that someone higher up in the BJP may have influenced to facilitate the Wadhawans to travel. Hence, Somaiya's false pretence will not work, Sawant said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Gupta has already been sent on compulsory leave by the Maharashtra government. Earlier in the day, Somaiya had hit out at the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state and alleged the Wadhawans shared "close ties" with NCP chief Sharad Pawar and other leaders of the party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Wadhwan grp has been main donors for @BJP4India DHFL HDIL RKW all funded BJP...Hence false pretence of @KiritSomaiya won't work," the Congress leader tweeted. He alleged that Wadhawan's company, in which a BJP MP is a partner, is developing Vijaydurga port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Recalling that Gupta was appointed by the previous Fadnavis government, Sawant said that help from someone higher up in the BJP to the Wadhawans cannot be ruled out. The Congress leader said the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra has taken immediate action against Gupta and asked the Modi government, too, to do the same to come clean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Somaiya also said that there has to be "some political influence" behind IPS officer Gupta's letter exempting the Wadhawans from the lockdown norms citing a family emergency. He also had demanded Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh over the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The DHFL promoters Wadhawans, their family and close friends travelled from Khandala near Pune to Mahabaleshwar in Satara district on Wednesday evening despite coronavirus lockdown..

What's worse is that DeSantis appears to not know that the reason that schools are closed during the coronavirus pandemic is not because the virus is killing kids in big numbers but rather that children are demonstrated carriers and vectors of the illness to adults. A kid might get coronavirus and have mild (or no) symptoms at all. But they could pass it to a teacher, a parent or another adult who gets much, much sicker. And that adult could then pass coronavirus to more people. And on and on we go.

We are used to being out shaking hands and in a closer environment with the public,” Fansler said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    When asked how officers are handling the stress, he said it seems most are doing OK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I believe it hasn’t really sunk in for most. It is all still kind of surreal. Only when the commercials come on showing the metropolitan areas with hardly anyone walking around, does it strike some,” Fansler said. “I do see more masks being worn now than before. Albeit, a lot are being worn incorrectly. But [people] are trying.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                    At the Sheriff’s Office, Dressel said a few members have had to self-isolate either from exposure or because they showed similar symptoms to COVID-19, but so far, none have tested positive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Anyone who can work from home is doing so, and staff have made other drastic adjustments, as needed, he said, including the Information Services team working through technical issues to keep information flowing without too much of an impact on service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As in other agencies, deputies handle as many calls by phone as possible, directing some complaints to the online system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For calls that require actual law enforcement, fire or medical personnel, dispatchers ask screening questions to get a better idea of any COVID-19 risk factors on scene, Dressel said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Deputies all have N95 masks and instructions on how to wear and store them properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Deputies also screen anyone taken to the jail before they enter the facility, to quarantine anyone who is a risk away from the rest of the population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dressel related via social media this week that the jail currently has “zero cases” of COVID-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Things are different than they were just a few weeks ago, and change is always challenging,” Dressel said, “but our deputies and members work in a field where no two days are alike, so they have been able to adapt quickly to the way we have to go about business these days.”

Analysts warn the proposed 10 million barrel per day cut for May and June will not be enough to offset plummeting demand for oil globally and runs the risk of coming too late as storage capacity for oil nears its maximum. Even if North American producers took 5 million barrels a day off the market, there could still be an excess supply of 5-10 million barrels per day.

When I first met Cohn, I was an Assistant US Attorney and Cohn was being investigated by a federal grand jury. I worked for Robert M. Morgenthau then and that investigation resulted in indictments. Cohn was in the anteroom of the grand jury chamber and witnesses were waiting to testify and he raised his open hand in what might be interpreted as a high five. I naively thought it was a high five to encourage the witnesses since they were facing the daunting experience of testifying before a grand jury. And it wasn't the high five at all. He was telling them to take the Fifth.

Po skladbe Nasaďme si Hrušky je to ďalšia skladba s aktualnou temou. _„ Na rozdiel od predchadzajucej skladby tato novinka prešla postprodukciou a mixažou Paľa Fecika, keď sme všetko riešili online. V klipe mal prsty aj naš fanušik Daniel Buc, ktorý z nudy doma vytvoril video s animovanou postavičkou a napadlo mi, že ho oslovim, či by chcel spolupracovať na klipe. Potešilo ho to a tak sme v priebehu troch dni vytvorili klip len pomocou smartfonov, ktore disponuju rozširenou realitou. O výslednu podobu klipu sa postaral dlhoročný kamarat a kameraman Pavol Varga. Je to už štvrta skladba v tomto roku pre kapelu Smola a Hrušky alebo pre solový projekt Spoko a navyše ide o treti song, ktorý vznikol spontanne a bez dlhých priprav,"_ dodava lider kapely.

"It just kind of left us thinking, 'what if,'" Flat Rock coach Marc Villemure said. "(March 12) was just a really strange day. Our girls were really looking forward to that game. (Edison) is loaded, they just have a lot of talent. It would have been a really good measuring stick game to see where we're at."
 Villemure's Rams were among the last 16 teams left standing in the Division 2 girls' basketball state playoffs. They were also one of two Downriver-area girls' teams teams that saw a postseason run abruptly halted. Allen Park Inter-City Baptist was scheduled to play in a Division 4 regional final game on March 12.
 Flat Rock wrapped up with an overall record of 21-3, including a perfect 14-0 mark in Huron League play, culminating in a league title. The Rams had won 20 consecutive games after a 1-3 start to the season.
 "...They're just a wonderful group of girls to coach and be around," Villemure said. Our seniors in particular, it's been great to see them grow since they were freshmen playing on varsity. We really pride ourselves on our defense and I think we excelled in that area this year."
 Speaking of those Flat Rock 12th graders, three of them earned All-Huron League honors. Sarah Kopp was named first-team all-conference, Sara Serbantez was named second-team and Amy Jackson was an honorable mention. Also joining Kopp on the league's first-team was sophomore Kayla Giroux, who has already emerged as one of the area's top overall athletes.

The Titanic is one of the most famous tragedies in maritime history.
 And a number of its victims and survivors were quite famous too.
 The ocean liner, which sank off the coast of Newfoundland on its maiden voyage to New York City, was billed as the paragon of luxury travel. As a result, many prominent individuals decided to book a trip on the doomed ship.
 Some of the ship's most famous passengers included a top fashion designer, one of the wealthiest men in the world, and a famous British countess.
 For the most part, most of the well-known people on board were first-class passengers. Researcher Chuck Anesi crunched the numbers, breaking down the demographics of the survivors. He found that 97.22% of the 144 female first- class passengers were rescued, while only 32.57% of their 175 male counterparts were saved.

He emphasised the need for development partners, who have been major contributors to the health sector over the years, to reprogramme existing funding to support the COVID-19 response, adding:  “The development and humanitarian community must rise to the occasion to support communities with public health information and emergency relief, especially for the poor and the vulnerable.

"Since my junior year I've been balancing both," Oglesby said. "Later in my senior year is when I decided basketball was the way to go. It was the thing I enjoyed the most, and I decided that if I enjoy it more, I should do it for the next four years."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Oglesby's recruiting process began during football season and carried into basketball season. He fielded basketball offers from William Jewell, Emporia State and a handful of junior colleges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Oglesby says he chose Emporia because of the relationship he built with their current coach, Craig Doty, who won a NAIA national title at Graceland in 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "They've got a great coach," Oglesby said. "He's building the program down there. He knows what he's doing."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Hornets went 10-18 in Doty's second year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The players have bought in. It's a program that I can go to, where I know everyone wants to succeed," Oglesby said.

Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder hopes he is “close” to signing a central midfielder ahead of today’s transfer deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wilder, who has already signed eight players since the Blades won promotion to the Premier League and has broken the club’s transfer record four times this summer, is trying to get another in on loan before the window closes at 5pm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wilder also expects a couple of departures from Bramall Lane as the club prepares to make its long-awaited Premier League return away at Bournemouth on Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We are trying to add a central midfield player to the group and if we do I’ll be delighted with what we’ve done so far, in terms of what I was given at the back end of last season and how we have gone about it in structure, the age and the ambition and desire of the players we have brought in,” said Wilder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I should imagine, like every manager up and down the country, we are close but things can change pretty quickly. But we are just banging away and seeing if we can do something before the window closes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “It is amazing how it comes down to these last few hours. We did a lot of our work pretty early, which I’m delighted with, but if we can get one more I’ll be delighted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “If it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t then we go with the group we’ve got. It could be an exciting last few hours and one deal sparks other deals. We are waiting for a few things to happen and if they do I will be delighted because we’ve got our eyes on some targets that are going to make us better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “As regards going out, there’s a couple of bits of interest in Mark Duffy and Leon Clarke, who are established Championship players, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they went by the close of play.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Sheffield United have been absent from the Premier League for 12 years, since their controversial relegation in 2007 involving West Ham and the Carlos Tevez affair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As a Blades fan in charge of his boyhood club, Wilder admits it could be emotional when he leads out the team at Bournemouth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I’ve always said I’m proud whenever I lead Sheffield United out. I’m focused on the game, I’m excited and of course I’m proud to represent and lead the club back out in the Premier League,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “It’s been a long way back and obviously there’s going to be a lot of emotion around the fixture but we’re professionals and we have to concentrate on trying to get a result at a very difficult place against a team and manager I have a lot of admiration for.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bookmakers have made Sheffield United, who won promotion as runners-up in the Championship, favourites to be relegated this season but Wilder is unperturbed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I’m fine with it,” he said. “It’s something we have to embrace. But where would you rather be, playing last week in the Championship or playing in the best league in the world? It’s about opinions and I get that and I don’t have a problem with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Two out of the three that went up last year were relegated so we understand we will be up against it. We understand the journey we have been on and how quickly things have happened and that we will be coming up against some powerful clubs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “But we will stick together and work hard for each other and we are determined not to just make the numbers up.”

The guys from Car Advice decided to take it to a track nearby and compare it to the A35 AMG, a car that needs no further introduction. Can the MINI keep up on the track?

The need to fight and kill an enemy depends on gravity and the damage the circumstances may cause any sovereign nation.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            But the melodramatic killing Abiy and his cronies have been undertaking for the past 2 years in Oromia and the Amhara states don’t fit the requirements of combating the invading enemy demands at any given time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Much of the killing, torturing and jailing of empire Ethiopia’s youth stems from lack of basic humanity, incompetence, complacency, and lack of basic decency of the so-called UNIY party, also known as Pilxigina.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Oromians are used to death, imprisonment, harassment and to the disappearance of thousands of innocent people but the recent killing of 200 Amhara youth-only leads to a deadly breakdown of the already fracturing empire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The power-hungry former EPRDF members who are running empire Ethiopia today lack basic humanity, sense of community and social trust, and their day to day actions are clearly endangering the natural empathy that humans should have for one another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The disdain the people of the empire have for Abiy’s cronies may have robbed the group of sense of humanity, and thereby, the social cohesion necessary to build a peaceful society can not survive the crisis created. This is a recipe for disaster with mind-boggling magnitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Ever since it was created, empire Ethiopia functioned with a short supply of competent and genuine people with a sense of common good. What is sad at this point is that the empire hit the rock bottom after falling in the hands of little men who know nothing but lying about everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Abiy and his cronies have proved themselves to be the least credible group that ever led empire Ethiopia. In the process, human life was put in harm’s way on a daily basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Well, history will render judgment on Abiy Ahmed’s contribution to the collapse of trust across the empire's institutions and the recent killing of 200 young people suggests more disaster compounded by human carnage, hate, economic disparity, and long-lasting failure.

Also musing a restart is the English Football League, the tiers below the Premier League, which told clubs to tell players that there would be no training allowed until at least 16th May ahead of possible restart in June and a very condensed end to the season.

_SPRINGFIELD_ — When _BusinessWest_ launched its 40 Under Forty program in 2007, it did so to identify rising stars across our region — individuals who were excelling in business and through involvement within the community — and celebrate their accomplishments.

You might be on hold for quite some time and when I say that I’m being generous because it could be hours. It can be absolutely frustrating to say the least, but keep a tab on all the calls you’ve made because you want to have something as a backup if needed. Now back to what we were discussing: finances. How do you best go about not just protecting your money, but ensuring you are being smart about what you spend?

"During this critical time when we're all longing to get outside for some fresh air and physical activity, I encourage people to enjoy the outdoors close to home by taking a walk around the block or spending time in their backyards," Coit said in a statement.

“In the light of the magnitude of these pressures, it is considered that the Maltese authorities are not in a position to guarantee the rescue of prohibited immigrants on board of any boats, ships or other vessels, nor to ensure the availability of a ‘safe place’ on the Maltese territory to any persons rescued at sea,’’ the government said in a statement.

Teemu Pukki insisted his hat-trick for Norwich against Newcastle was the stuff of dreams for a player picked up on a free transfer last summer.


  The Finnish forward fired the Canaries ahead with a sweetly-struck volley at Carrow Road and added a second and third inside 12 minutes of the second half to take the game away from the visitors.


  Pukki was released by Danish side Brondby in the summer of 2018 before Norwich brought him in, and the player repaid that faith by finishing the 2018-19 season as the top goalscorer in the Championship as Daniel Farke’s men were promoted as champions.


  “That was one of the best games I’ve had here,” Pukki told the BBC’s Match of the Day programme.


  “A hat-trick in the Premier League is something I couldn’t even dream of a couple of years ago.”


  Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker pointed out to Pukki that his hat- trick was the first in the Premier League by a Norwich player since Efan Ekoku in 1993.


  “I didn’t know that – it sounds pretty special,” the Finn added.


  Norwich boss Farke felt the win would do wonders for his side’s confidence.


  “It is important to get off the mark as quickly as possible and to do this immediately in the home game against such a good side like Newcastle is outstanding and good for the mood, good for the self-confidence,” he said.


  “It’s always good to have the first win under your belt.”


  Steve Bruce, whose side had only an injury-time consolation goal from Jonjo Shelvey to show for their efforts, insisted there was no lack of desire from his players but admitted they needed to improve in “a lot of departments”.


  “Make no mistake, we’ve only been here four, four and a half weeks and we’ll go again next week and improve and can be better,” he said.


  “I wouldn’t question their desire, I think they just got caught up in (Norwich’s first home game).


  “I can’t question anyone’s desire. I don’t think you want to go out there and do badly but certainly we can do more in a lot of departments and I think that was the frustrating thing from our perspective.”

Cardiff boss Neil Warnock beat Luton to the signing of Isaac Vassell and was rewarded when he came on to score a last-gasp winner against the Championship new boys.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Vassell, a deadline-day capture from Birmingham, headed home Junior Hoilett’s cross to secure a 2-1 victory.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Aden Flint got on the end of Josh Murphy’s teasing free-kick to volley home his first goal for the Bluebirds in the 56th minute.                                                                                                                                                                                                    After German forward Robert Glatzel missed a golden chance from a Hoilett cross, Luton levelled when Matty Pearson headed Luke Berry’s cross past Alex Smithies into the bottom corner but Warnock brought on Vassell in place of Glatzel and it proved to be a match-winning move.                                                                                                                                                                                                    “There are twists and turns in the window and you have to take advantage if you can,” said Warnock.                                                                                                                                                                                                    “It’s not just a goalscorer goal, he ran 50 yards to close someone down and it just spread to the crowd and the other players.                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I watched him on a cold windy night at Truro when I was out of work for a few weeks and he did everything right that night.                                                                                                                                                                                                    “He played up front and on the right and in the hole and he ran and ran and ran.

But other clubs got involved and we were unable to compete financially,” said Jones.                                                                                                                                                                                                    “But not defending the cross is more disappointing than not signing him. It just showed how ruthless the Championship can be. We have (to) learn from it. I’m not thinking about who scored, but who’s stopping the cross.                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We didn’t control the moment. We were slicing things and putting it out for throw-ins. That’s how they play. It’s not how we play.

_Cyberpunk 2077_ will get at least as much DLC as _The Witcher 3_, and you can expect information about it to start rolling out in the months and weeks ahead of the game's arrival.


  CD Projekt recently hosted a Polish Q&A session with investors where it talked about its upcoming business plans, and one of the topics touched on was Cyberpunk 2077's DLC. The game's developer has confirmed in the past that its overall approach for adding content to the game _will be similar to its approach for The Witcher 3_, and these most recent comments - as translated by _VGC_ \- confirm that there will be a good amount of it.


  Adam Kiciński, CD Projekt president, said Cyberpunk 2077 will have "no less DLC than The Witcher 3 had", and as far as when those DLCs will be announced, we should anticipate "a similar scenario to The Witcher 3". That means we can look forward to a substantial spread of free updates rolling into the game to expand it in the short term, and at least two major paid DLC expansions to be released for Cyberpunk 2077 later on.


  On top of all this, CD Projekt Red is still hard at work on Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer, which the developer is treating as _a separate AAA release several years down the line_ \- so it probably isn't being counted among the DLC for the single-player game. The studio has confirmed multiple times that _coronavirus concerns should not mean any further delays_ for Cyberpunk 2077, so hopefully we can all expect to bombard CD Projekt Red with "expansion when?!" messages come September.


   _CD Projekt Red is also planning to make a_ _ _"full-blown next-gen version" of Cyberpunk 2077__ _, but not in time for the console launches this year._

Already, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said the country should be looking “to all-mail ballots across the board” because of the pandemic. But President Donald Trump has weighed in strongly against voting by mail, even though he himself casts absentee ballots and Republicans have often favored mail-in ballots especially for older people.

Stead was a highly influential editor who, in an uncanny twist, may have foreseen his death on the Titanic.
 As the editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, the newspaperman published an explosive and controversial investigative series about child prostitution. He is credited with helping to invent investigative journalism.
 A devoted spiritualist, Stead also established a magazine dedicated to the supernatural and a psychic service known as Julia's Bureau.
 He also penned a fictional story in 1886 that bore an unsettling resemblance to the real-life events of the Titanic.
 "How the Mail Steamer Went Down in Mid Atlantic, by a Survivor" tells a story of an ocean liner that sinks in the Atlantic. In the story, only 200 passengers and crew members of the original 700 people on board survive the disaster, due to a lifeboat shortage.
 According to Biography.com, Stead didn't hang around on deck as the Titanic sank. He spent his final hours reading in his cabin.

“These overwhelmingly high numbers speak for themselves. This more than $1 billion in urgently needed relief is great news for our State, and it will help thousands of Maine small employers continue to pay their employees and keep from closing their doors,” said Senator Collins.  “I worked hard with a bipartisan group of my colleagues to create this forgivable loan program to support small employers and their employees, which will address the cash-flow problem that small businesses are facing due to the economic harm caused by COVID-19.  Maine banks and credit unions are working around the clock to assist small businesses and certain nonprofits with their funding needs.  I will continue to work closely with these financial institutions, the SBA, and the Treasury Department to ensure this approved funding is disbursed as soon as possible.”

Three tubs of absentee ballots that never reached voters were discovered in a postal center outside Milwaukee. At least 9,000 absentee ballots requested by voters were never sent, and others recorded as sent were never received. Even when voters did return their completed ballots in the mail, thousands were postmarked too late to count — or not at all. Cracks in Wisconsin’s vote-by- mail operation are now emerging after the state’s scramble to expand that effort on the fly for voters who feared going to the polls in Tuesday’s elections.

Noel Leslie, Countess of Rothes, was one of the Titanic's most famous passengers at the time.
 A popular figure in London society, Leslie became a countess after marrying Norman Evelyn Leslie, Earl of Rothes, in 1900.
 Leslie and her cousin Gladys Cherry booked a trip on the Titanic. According to Biography.com, both Leslie and Cherry escaped on a lifeboat and assisted crew members in rowing the raft to safety.
 The cousins, along with crew member Thomas Jones, reportedly advocated rowing back to search for survivors, but their fellow lifeboat occupants voted against it.
 The countess reportedly helped take care of her fellow survivors on board the Carpathia. According to Encyclopedia Titanica, she was dubbed "the plucky little countess" in the press and was a major subject of the media frenzy that ensued in the wake of the disaster.
 After surviving the Titanic disaster, Leslie became a prominent philanthropist and worked as a nurse during World War I.

And since the MINI JCW Clubman and the M135i xDrive share a lot of their underpinnings, from the engine to the gearbox, one could wonder which one to get. If it was my money, I'd go for the more practical MINI which also sounds better. Getting back to the comparison at hand here, the superior torque of the lighter MINI allow it to catch up to the Merc on the straights but the 8-speed Aisin gearbox is a bit of a letdown in the corners, allowing the AMG to pull away. It's a pretty close call though and if you take the price difference into account, it's not an easy decision to make.

A plethora of benefits offered by agriculture robots such as accuracy and precision, minimal requirement of human labor, faster task accomplishment, cost benefits, and fatigueless functioning will encourage their wider adoption across the global agricultural industry. The rising labor cost is creating substantial demand for automation in the agriculture sector. A few of the innovations expected to bolster adoption of agriculture robots in the long run are use of wireless sensors, driverless tractors, penetration of wearable and drones, proliferation of controls and systems driven robots, and the rising demand for the 3D printing technology in the agriculture sector.

Ashley Henderson, of Ganado, put together Easter baskets at Cotton Belles Boutique in Victoria on Thursday.


  Henderson closed her business after the initial confirmed COVID-19 cases in Victoria, so she was making Facebook videos when people started asking for Easter egg baskets. Since then, she’s made more than 60 different baskets for kids and nursing home seniors in Victoria. Henderson is worried about how the 10 small businesses who sell their products in her shop and how they will be affected by the coronavirus closures. “It is a very scary time to have a business and I’m concerned about my artisans and I know they are a little fearful right now,” Henderson said. “We’ve never had to deal with something like this.”


  Amanda Mamerow, owner of The Sweetheart Boutique in Ganado, also started making Easter baskets for Ganado residents about five days ago. She had the supplies already and wanted to make sure everyone could have a basket. Mamerow has been in business for 10 years and never experienced anything like this before. “It’s been overwhelming,” Mamerow said. “We thought that we might make 10, but we’ll probably hit over 100.” Mamerow will be taking orders on Friday and can be contacted at 361-771-3131.

They hit the front eleven minutes into the second half through Scott Hogan’s emphatic finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                    But Waghorn bagged his second of a high-tempo game with a 70th minute penalty to leave Stoke waiting for that first win.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Waghorn opened the scoring inside the first 120 seconds after he turned home a Kieran Dowell cross with a first-time finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Stoke should have levelled six minutes later when Joe Allen hit the post from a yard out after Kelle Roos had brilliantly saved a Sam Clucas header.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Jack Butland beat away Dowell’s dangerous inswinging free-kick on 12 minutes as the open start continued.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Lee Gregory had a close range shot turned behind for a corner following a good turn on 31 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                    And the hosts made the set-piece count when Lindsay levelled with a powerful header from inside the six-yard box.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Tom Ince cracked an effort against the crossbar from 12 yards out on 38 minutes after a blocked shot fell kindly.                                                                                                                                                                                                    James McClean failed to connect with the ball in first-half stoppage time after he pulled away at the back post.                                                                                                                                                                                                    George Evans won a corner for the visitors on 53 minutes as the Rams looked to get a foothold in the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                    But they found themselves behind when debutant Hogan smashed home into the roof of the net on 56 minutes to deservedly put Stoke ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Derby will have been left asking questions over their defending after Lee Gregory was allowed to race on to a long ball over the top, before picking out an unmarked Hogan.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Clucas powered a header just over minutes later as Stoke continued to keep the pressure up.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Tommy Smith and Tom Lawrence both received bookings in the 67th minute for their part in an ugly touchline melee of players following a late tackle by Florian Jozefzoon.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Derby were given an unlikely lifeline after George Evans was brought down in the box two minutes later.                                                                                                                                                                                                    And Waghorn, who missed a penalty in last week’s 0-0 draw with Swansea, made no mistake as he slotted home straight down the middle to send Butland the wrong way.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Peter Etebo flashed a long range effort just wide deep into seven minutes of stoppage time.

“Uiteindelijk is winnen voor ons niet het belangrijkste”, zegt Volk. “Op deze manier te werk gaan, met een menselijke artiest in the loop, was al heel waardevol. We hebben veel geleerd van de samenwerking met Willie Wartaal. En daarnaast hopen we vooral dat het veel discussie oproept over AI en muziek.”

The American newspaper Boston Globe revealed that the Japanese drug favipiravir obtained the green light from the Food and Drug Administration for use as a potential drug against the Covid-19 epidemic, indicating that the state of Massachusetts will become the first US state to test the drug in humans.

Letting our small business suffocate has a multiplier effect. Look at our chambers of commerce. They are filled with locally-owned insurance agents, accountants, lawyers, and other service firms who want to sell their services to our vibrant local business district owners. Without local businesses, what will those service firms do? Sell accounting services to Target? Sell your legal services in small town Florida to Walmart? Chambers of commerce, help us fight for small business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    When local businesses suffer, they stop paying rent. Landlords stop paying banks. If 20-30% of our retail storefronts go dark, does anyone not understand we will have a banking crisis too?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The heart of our communities is being destroyed by this shutdown. The big chains are allowed to be wide open. Michaels, Best Buy, Home Depot, Target, Walmart, JoAnn Fabrics, nationally owned construction firms are still in full swing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We are going to create ghost towns in our downtowns with this terrible policy of a hard shutdown that applies hardest to our locally owned businesses. The economic destruction will be devastating right in our front yards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Here’s what we should do: If a consumer can buy clothes and shoes at Walmart then the locally owned shoe and clothing store should be open too. Or, just close all the nonessential goods at Walmart so everyone is treated the same. Why can we go to Home Depot to do spring gardening (nonessential) but not go the park for a walk?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The quibbling above reveals the heart of the issue. Why not give our most vulnerable, the small business, the benefit of the doubt? Do we value the big chains over a local business run by a husband, wife and two daughters? I know my answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We should figure out what social separation means in retail. I’m don’t know for sure how, but a rule that says no more than one customer in a business per thousand feet would treat all businesses the same and allow small business to be treated just like the big chains. It might also be the path forward from this crisis. Governor DeSantis, we need your plan. Where is it?

After the cold and dreary months of winter, I am always eager for spring and to decorate for the Easter season. For me, celebrating Easter and the joys of spring go hand in hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Once you make the decision to set a formal or informal table, then the fun can begin. We've become a disposable society where paper plates, cups and napkins are the norm for family gatherings. Consider using the opportunity to take out the fine china, crystal and flatware. If you don't own fine china, but would like to start your own collection, visit estate sales or antique malls. While you're searching for these goodies, keep your eyes open for ceramic bunnies, chicks and lambs. Vintage tablecloths, napkins and candle holders are often found for great prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For a semi-formal place setting, I have often used wicker chargers. Dollar stores offer so many unique items to "fill in the gaps" on the table. Consider small vine bird's nests, tiny Easter eggs to fill small baskets at each place setting and holiday-themed salt and pepper shakers. Fresh flowers are always appropriate to herald the arrival of spring!                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For fun and informal meals, vibrant Fiestaware plates always bring compliments from my guests. If you don't want to purchase an entire set of dishes, neighborhood yard sales and estate sales are your friends. The best part of using Fiestaware (besides its bright colors) is the ease of mixing and matching. I've used pink, purple, robin's egg blue, green, orange and yellow all together for an Easter egg color-themed table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        If room allows, have a separate "kids' table." Children love the bright colors and, again, the dollar stores are a treasure trove of goodies for setting the perfect table for your youngest guests. Vinyl tablecloths that can be easily cleaned are perfect for the inevitable spills and drips. Melamine plates are suitable for the kids, along with plastic cups or glasses. Consider filling a large basket with plastic Easter eggs as your centerpiece. If time allows before the meal, let the kids decorate their own boiled and dyed egg to use as their place setting marker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Don't forget about the serving pieces. Silver trays, vintage egg plates for stuffed eggs, cabbage shaped bowls for coleslaw and platters with a carrot motif all contribute to the beauty of your Easter table. Plan ahead and visit your local hobby or department stores the days after Easter. You'll find great bargains for next spring's family table.

James Maddison and Harvey Barnes have warned there is plenty more to come from Leicester after their hard-fought 2-1 win at Sheffield United.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers has targeted a top-six finish and his young side’s display at a partisan Bramall Lane provided further evidence of their potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Foxes showed their resilience as they went toe-to-toe with the Blades, while two top-class goals from Jamie Vardy and Barnes secured them their first win of the season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Every interview I’m doing I’m telling people how much quality we’ve got in this squad,” said Maddison, who was man of the match in front of watching England boss Gareth Southgate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We have to show that. It’s no good just saying it to you guys, we have to go and show the quality we’ve got.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I think with Saturday’s performance we did that. Sheffield United is a tough place to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I’ve played here with Norwich and now Leicester and both games have been really tough.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Vardy’s clinical finish after Maddison’s killer pass gave Leicester a half-time lead and, after substitute Oli McBurnie had headed the Blades’ deserved equaliser, Barnes stepped off the bench to fire home a blistering winner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Barnes, who unleashed an unstoppable half-volley six minutes after replacing recent signing Dennis Praet, agreed both goals were from the Premier League’s top drawer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Very much so,” he said. “You’ve seen with Vards’ goal. We’ve been playing a lot of short passes and playing out from the back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “But we do have that element in our game where we can release Vards with his pace and kill teams that way, and here it’s paid off very well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “There’s definitely more to come. We’re not going to get ahead of ourselves, it’s very early in the season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “But I think we’re looking to be a lot more clinical in the final third and pick up as many points as we can.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Blades’ club record signing McBurnie headed home his first goal for the club since arriving in a deal reported to be worth up to £20million earlier this month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But his satisfaction at getting off the mark with a classic centre-forward’s header was tempered by his side’s second defeat in 21 matches under Wilder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We know there’s quality in this division,” McBurnie said. “We know that if we’re not at it we’re going to get punished and I think that’s what happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We huffed and puffed at the end, but it wasn’t for long enough really to expect to get something in this league.”

I worry while writing this that it might be a little bit cringey to sing the praises of Anthony Bourdain. He was often a bit macho, sometimes fat-phobic, and yes, an old white male celebrity. My inner intersectional feminist is screaming. There is also a part of me that has been carefully trained to distrust celebrity books. So many authors who could survive off celebrity book deals and the writing in them is usually eye-gougingly terrible at its best.

The releases bring to an end a year-plus long saga regarding the team's WWE status.  Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder reportedly asked for their releases back in January of 2019 over frustration regarding the company's treatment of the tag team division.  The team is reported to have turned down contracts last April that would feature major pay raises to the tune of a total $500,000 per year for five years.

The Union ministry of health and family welfare has issued a short video clip on 'How to Safely Stop Drinking due to Lockdown' for alcoholics who cannot get their daily dose of alcohol because of the lockdown."In this lockdown period if anyone is used to taking large amounts of alcohol daily, or is hooked on to alcohol, then this can be trying time for these individuals," says Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, in the beginning of the video that runs for 1.53 minutes.Then comes the expert in de-addiction, additional professor in the department of psychiatry, Dr Ravindra Rao."Some of us, who are using alcohol on a regular basis, say daily or almost daily, may experience some discomfort, either physical or psychological. Psychological discomfort will manifest in the form of anxiety, restlessness, and the physical discomfort could manifest in terms of palpitation, breathing difficulty, tremors of hand, not being able to sleep at night," he says.Then the video goes on to visually narrate ways to cope with both physical and psychological discomfort.Ways to cope with psychological discomfort"Try to make yourself busy by watching movies, by watching television, by spending time with your family members, your children; indulge in some activities like gardening, or exercising. Remember to drink lots of water during this time. Have a fitful sleep for eight to nine hours, which will make you feel better," says Rao.Ways to cope with physical discomfortHowever, if you have physical discomfort then Rao advises not to take it lightly as it could escalate to problematic symptoms such as seizures or delirium."You need to take the help of a doctor during such time, and the doctor will prescribe you medication which you have to take under the directions advised to you," says Rao.The video ends by a public service message from the AIIMS director, who advises people to use this opportunity to quit drinking."I would also say that this is a good time to see how you can give up your addiction to alcohol for the simple reason that it will cause more harm than good in the long run," says Dr Guleria.

I think Barr has been quite cavalier about observing that tradition. He doesn't believe in it. He is contrarian and a libertarian. He believes in the unitary executive so that Trump is free to do basically anything he wants to do because he's the President of the United States. Barr has not been a check on Trump's unbridled abuse of power, but it's not really for the attorney general to do that. It's for the Congress to do that through the impeachment power, so you can't say that Barr has failed to ride herd on the president because he would take the view that that's not his obligation.

"I think it's not a good idea to think the Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind issue. We have too many ships at sea, we have too many deployed capabilities. There's 5,000 sailors on a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. To think it will never happen again is not a good way to plan. What we have to do is figure out how to plan in these kind of Covid environments," Hyten said.

_I thank you Marcus for taking on the onerous task of acting as my secretary, in addition to your regular duties as my aide, in regard to this portion of the report. The Greek, Aristides, is competent, and like most Greek secretaries his Latin is quite graceful, but also like most Greek secretaries he does not know when to keep his mouth shut. I want him kept away from this work, and I want you to observe the strictest security. Caiaphas was playing a nefarious game, and I do not think we are out of the woods yet. I do not want his spies finding out what I am telling the Imperator and Caiaphas altering the tales his agents are now, no doubt,_ _spreading in Rome. Let us take the Jew by surprise for once!_

There is, however, nothing equivocal about the way Americans in particular and history writ large view things. Lovell was the successful commander of a triumphantly successful mission. That historical reckoning comes not despite the fact that his fragile, fickle spacecraft denied him the chance to set foot on the moon, but because of it.

Neil Warnock rued a losing return to the Championship as Cardiff were edged out 3-2 by Wigan.                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Bluebirds had beaten Manchester United at Old Trafford in their last outing in May before dropping back into the second tier.                                                                                                                                                                                                    They took the lead through Joe Ralls but Wigan recovered from the setback of a missed penalty by Josh Windass to lead through goals from Michael Jacobs and Windass.

All of which left Warnock, like the rest of the crowd, catching his breath – but disappointed with the outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                    “It was nothing I wasn’t expecting, we know exactly how tough this league is,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                    “You have to take your chances and I thought we had chances to kill the game.

Benjamin Guggenheim was a member of the powerful Guggenheim family, which earned its fortune in the mining industry.
 He was traveling on the ship with his mistress Leontine Aubart and a number of staffers.
 According to "LIFE Titanic: The Tragedy That Shook the World," Guggenheim was initially optimistic about the ship's prospects, telling his maid that, "We will soon see each other again. It's just a repair. Tomorrow the Titanic will go on again."
 Guggenheim, whose body was never recovered, reportedly put a rose in his buttonhole and quipped, "We've dressed up in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen."
 He later passed on a message to his estranged wife to a Titanic survivor. "Tell her I played the game out straight to the end," he reportedly said. "No woman shall be left aboard this ship because Ben Guggenheim is a coward."

It’s unclear how, exactly, hospitals’ legal obligations to patients have changed during this crisis. On March 23, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order, as part of broader disaster emergency efforts, that temporarily limits liability for health care workers. The order modifies existing law to provide that many medical professionals are immune from civil liability for injury or death as a direct result from their actions or omissions, unless gross negligence can be proved. The wording, though, is vague. Inside the hospital, there’s still uncertainty about the changes, according to a clinical administrative staff member at a hospital in Queens.

Tom Bradshaw was given a standing ovation by Millwall’s staff and players after ending his nightmare year by scoring in the 2-1 Carabao Cup win at West Brom. The 27-year-old striker had not netted since his record £1.25million move from Barnsley in January after initially joining the club on loan last August. Since then the Wales international has come back from a serious knee injury but had not got off the mark for his new club until the equaliser at The Hawthorns. Millwall came from…

NBA legend Magic Johnson says he's hopeful health experts will soon come up with effective treatment to help patients beat coronavirus -- but added important parts in overcoming the pandemic will be expanding testing and healthcare access to African American communities who have been hit the hardest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "We've got to make sure, first ... every American can get a test," Johnson told CNN Thursday night. The former Los Angeles Lakers player announced nearly 30 years ago he was HIV positive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The reason why I'm still living is because (of) early detection. I had a test, I had a physical. It came up that I had HIV and that saved my life," he said. "So people want to get tested. Until they get tested, people won't be comfortable because that's going to tell them whether they have this virus or not."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But tests, Johnson said, should be made available in all parts of the country so that all communities have equal access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The problem is people want us to drive to suburban America to get that test," he said. "Why can't you have that testing done right in urban America, right in the inner cities?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But having more tests won't be enough. For African American communities which have so far been the hardest hit by the virus in the US, he said wider access to medical care as wellas access to the right information about this virus will make all the difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "When you think about, first of all African Americans, we deal with a lot of health issues already. So we talk about HIV and AIDS, but obesity, when you think about diabetes, high blood pressure, so all these things we already deal with, then you add coronavirus on top of that, that's a tough situation," Johnson said. "And then the lack of access to health care, that's just an unbeatable situation."

Chicago officials said earlier this week 72% of coronavirus victims were black -- despite the fact that African Americans make up 30% of the city's population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In Louisiana, where 32% of the population is African American, those residents account for more than 70% of coronavirus deaths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "There's been inequalities and injustice going on for a long time especially when you think about minorities," Johnson said. "Until those things change, we're still going to have a lack of health care. We're still going to be behind the 8 ball when you think about African Americans."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But there's also a lot of misinformation contributing to the problem, Johnson said, which is reminiscent to the rumors and beliefs that floated around when there was still little known about HIV, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Blacks thought they couldn't get HIV and AIDS. It's the same thing as the coronavirus. It reminds me going back 30 years, we were all wrong."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "That's why we see these (coronavirus) numbers so high, because ... people went out there spreading the word that blacks couldn't get it, and now we see that not only can we get the coronavirus but we can die from the coronavirus," Johnson said. "So, in our community, we got to do a better job of making sure everybody knows that they can get this virus. And it's deadly."

Jews flock to the city of Jerusalem, the site of their Temple, and the religious fanaticism of the Jews, never far below the surface, always threatens to boil over into revolt. _When my patronSejanus, if there is an after-life I hope his shade knows peace, informed me that I was to be Prefect of Judea, he told me that I only had to do two things: keep the taxes flowing and keep the peace. He also warned me that the Jews were religious madmen who would try to thwart me at every turn! How right he was! How can you govern a people who threaten to rise up in revolt over standards, gold shields and using a portion of temple funds to build an aqueduct in Jerusalem, their only city worthy of the title? Sooner or later the Jews will rise in bloody revolt and a war will be fought with them to their annihilation. I trust this war will not occur during my term of office. I have had enough of a miserable climate, a miserable people and Yahweh, their completely incomprehensible god! I wander. It is late, I have worked too long and drunk too much wine.

In an age where your virtual background says more about you than actually being in the call, static backgrounds in Zoom are just plain boring.


  While Zoom supports video virtual backgrounds, finding an appropriate video can be challenging (although not impossible if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves), due to the length and work it takes to trim out just the section you want.


  Because the animated GIF is the new third language behind Emojis, it can easily communicate your thought of the day.


  Unfortunately Zoom doesn’t support animated GIFs and lets you add only static PNG, JPG and BMP files to use with its virtual clipping background. But there is a workaround, so keep reading to find out.

One measure Bashoor had already put in place to reduce risk was to reduce the number of units sent to a routine medical call: One ambulance instead of two, or a single medical team either in an ambulance or fire engine, instead of both vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    His staff also have used all the personal protection protocols, Bashoor said, as well as screening patients for fever, sore throat and cough, updating emergency room staff on their way to hospitals if patients showed symptoms of COVID-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As for how well Fire Rescue personnel are coping, Bashoor said supervisors keep in close touch with each of them, as well as with the newly-formed local Critical Incident Response Team, to manage expectations and concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Novel coronavirus had already caused new challenges for first responders. Prior to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people in one place, Highlands County Consolidated 911 Dispatch saw an increase in emergency calls for people congregating at public parks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As it stands now, gatherings of more than 10 people in “public spaces” are specifically prohibited in the governor’s order, said Scott Dressel, public information officer for the Highlands County Sheriff’s Office. He said law enforcement is tasked with making sure there are no more than 10 people at any public gathering or meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Call volume has dropped with the reduced traffic since the stay-at-home order, which has allowed emergency services to focus on medical calls, not wrecks, Bashoor said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Still, with Highlands County’s high percentage of residents older than 65, the likelihood is high that many of them could become infected, and Florida has not yet seen a peak to the infection rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As for law enforcement, Sebring Police Cmdr. Curtis Hart said he and Police Chief Karl Hoglund have one officer self-isolated due to a family member showing symptoms of COVID-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “As for everyone else, our department is holding up well,” Hart said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The station on North Ridgewood Drive has closed the lobby to the public, and anyone brought to the office by officers or administration is being screened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Our officers are continuing to use [personal protection equipment (PPE)], practicing social-distancing and hygiene protocols when possible and have been told not to come to work if they feel sick or have been around anyone having symptoms of the virus,” Hart said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Early on, officers implemented taking certain calls over the phone to limit exposure to others, “which I believe has helped,” Hart said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    However, he said they are still responding to all in-progress calls and other calls where an officer is requested to respond.

He'd never been in the pharmaceutical business and had never been in business at that point anywhere outside the United States. But this family had the wherewithal to defend the case and eventually the case was thrown out completely.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Friday that customers should shop once per week instead of stocking up for weeks on end to help avoid shortages in stores.
 He said the company's supply chain is healthy and merchandise continues to flow into stores, but demand remains high for items like hand sanitizer and paper goods amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 "There's plenty of flow coming, but if everyone could just kind of manage and buy week-to-week rather than stocking up at this point, it would be helpful for everybody," he told NBC News TODAY.
 He said food inventory is "recovering and in good shape."
 "Hand sanitizer has been a little harder to come by," he said. "Our associates have it and we're working to put it on the shelf but as soon as we do, it's gone. Paper goods are continuing to sell out quickly. In the last five days we've sold enough toilet paper for every American to have their own roll just in five days."

Los Angeles deputy mayor Jeff Gorell said in a tweet that CORE’s efforts will help take over the city’s fire department’s workload and free up first responders for emergency services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Penn hopes other non-profit organizations and local governments will help run test sites as well. In the meantime, he said everyone should be washing their hands so often, their hands should be “crispy.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Wash your hands because this is mostly hand to mouth from what we can tell. They gotta be really crispy, or you’re not doing it right,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ___                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

If your file’s resolution is too small, click the _Resize_ button and it’ll put your converted video into the Resize Tab. You can fill out just the New Width box or just the New Height box to meet the minimum size, and Ezgif.com will fill in the other box for you. This works most of the time, but if either is smaller than 640x360, you’ll have to increase the size.

Azhar Maqsusi is a well-known figure in Hyderabad. For the last eight years, Azhar has been waking up at 6 am. After spending some quality time with family, he steps out of his house at 10 am to get groceries from the Fateh Khan Bazaar. He and his team soon start cooking and by afternoon, hundreds of people who have not had a single meal, would be fed in Hyderabad.  Since the nationwide lockdown began, several people, including volunteers and NGOs, across various states have been pitching in to provide food to migrant labourers, homeless people and others who are stranded. For Azhar, however, this act of serving food to the needy has been a consistent one.  It has been eight years since he started feeding people under the Dabeerpura flyover in the city. Over the years, the work has expanded and Azhar and his team feed almost 1,500 people everyday at multiple areas across the city, and even in other states in India. Azhar says that he realised the effect of hunger in his teen years, when his father passed away. When did you first begin feeding the needy Today, April 10, marks the eighth year since we started our food service for the poor. It began after I saw an old lady named Lakshmi at a railway station. Her feet were amputated, she had not had any food to eat, so I gave her food that day. From the very next day, I started feeding homeless people at Dabeerpura under the banner of Hunger has no religion. Since then, our programme has continued and we feed people of all religions. We do it in different locations including Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Raichur and Delhi. What changes have you seen in the last eight years Earlier, free food was mostly served only in religious places, like a temple, dargah or gurudwara but that has changed now. Food is being served at hospitals and railway stations and various donors have come forward. I think of this as an achievement. What were the challenges that you faced when you started When we started out, there were many financial challenges. Ours is a middle class family and we run a gypsum plaster business. We dont particularly appeal for donations. If people come forward voluntarily and donate groceries and rice, we accept it. There were days when I had to borrow money or sell scrap material to feed people but eventually, through social media, several people came forward and started helping us.  How has the lockdown changed things Before the lockdown, we used to cook and serve food at different locations, and would make people sit together and eat. However, due to the lockdown, we are now packing the food and distributing it as food packets instead. We have drawn boxes for maintaining social distance; whoever is in need of food stands in a queue inside those boxes to collect the food packets. Usually, we serve the homeless, destitute and people begging on the streets. Now, we are serving migrant laborers as well by going to various locations in our van. What food is provided To make it easy for packing, we are giving tomato rice or vegetable biryani during the lockdown period.  Usually, there are cooks at the different places where we serve food. Most times, I also lend a hand. When it comes to my first dish, I have learnt cooking khatti dal and whenever there is no cook available, I cook. I know how to make chicken biryani, vegetable pulao, tomato rice, etc which I learnt gradually. What keeps you motivated Service to mankind is the service to god. Humanity is the most important degree that everyone should have apart from their other degrees.

Look, what’s happening on a global scale is extremely serious. Watching friends not be able to sleep because they’re worried about they gonna make ends meet, reading stories of people being laid off and not being able to collect unemployment and seeing the fear that this pandemic is causing does a lot on the soul. Then, of course, there are all these deaths and the concern for my parents, who due to their age, are some of the most vulnerable to this virus.

Her online classes are part of the efforts of Skagit County’s senior centers to keep seniors informed, social and active in a time when isolation and worry can be especially hard on their health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Loneliness is an epidemic, especially for seniors. It (affects) everything from nutrition to social skills and overall health,” said Jackie Cress, the Burlington Senior Center coordinator. “I worry about the seniors who are homebound, as they’re supposed to be. We have to find every way we have to keep them plugged in so they don’t feel alone. We all feel that way.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In an effort to combat the loneliness, the Burlington Senior Center has made several efforts to reach out to seniors who cannot visit the facility while it’s closed under the state’s stay-at-home order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cress said more than 1,300 seniors had signed up for the center’s activities in the last full month before the facility shut down on March 11.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Among the efforts that may prove most helpful are a newly established “phone pal” system where seniors can call into the center and connect with someone who’d like to chat with them; a pen-pal program that encourages kids to write letters or send artwork that are delivered to seniors; and a daily photo contest on the center’s Facebook page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mary Unser of Sedro-Woolley said she enjoys the “Grumpy Old Men Yoga, Ladies Welcome” program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I enjoy the online class because it is a good way to safely meet and practice yoga together,” she said. “The teacher Eddie (Pole) and his wife Susan accept you at whatever level you are at. It’s a welcoming group of people of all ages and abilities.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In a thank-you email sent to the senior center, Unser wrote: “Class has been helped me in so many ways. I am so thankful to be in class again.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Eddleman said there has been an unexpected benefit to the online classes; two former participants who moved away — one to Virginia, one to Arizona — have since rejoined the group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “It’s been an exciting way to go about this,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cress said she’s pleased so many seniors have been able to stay connected online, but is concerned about those who cannot join them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Many don’t have access to computers,” she said. “... we struggle with how to get info to them. We’re trying every little thing we can think of.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Sally Hill, the administrator of the Anacortes Senior Activity Center, has similar concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As soon as the scope of the pandemic and its potential effects on seniors became apparent, she made a list of seniors whom she knew needed to be contacted. She’s checked in with them over the phone, and one has a neighbor who has agreed to bring daily hot meals, Hill said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “It’s extremely important. Without that engagement there’s risk of depression. There are a lot of studies that link that with physical issues, shortening of life,” she said of seniors’ risk of isolation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Hill said the center serves 150 or more seniors a day. While the building is no longer open, the staff is still trying to find ways to reach out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Every day we’re putting puzzles on the front bench. They’re not only for seniors or people who come to the center; anyone can help themselves to the jigsaw puzzles. Another thing is (answering) the phone. I’m pleased we can be there. We answer the phone, and more and more people say, ‘Oh, I’m so glad you’re answering the phone.’ There’s great value in people being able to call, ask for information or services or talk to a person.”

On Wednesday, Flemish Health Minister Wouter Beke came under fire for rolling out an emergency plan to fight back spiking rates of contagion and deaths in the region's nursing homes, which critics said came too late.

I commend the County Board of Education’s decision to pay out the second round of supplemental pay for its school’s spring coaches.
 I have to ask, though – why was the question ever up in the air?
 We can start with the basics. One, the spring sports season has not been canceled. As of this date, it has only been postponed until May 18.

Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon and his wife Lady Lucy Duff-Gordon were two of the most prominent passengers on board the Titanic.
 Duff-Gordon was a major landowner and society figure in the UK, known for his fencing skills. Lady Duff-Gordon was a top British fashion designer, whose innovations included the precursor to the modern day fashion show.
 The Duff-Gordons booked a trip on the Titanic in order to travel to New York City on business. When disaster struck, they both escaped on the first lifeboat that embarked off the ship.
 According to Vogue, Lady Duff-Gordon described the scene on the Titanic, saying, "Everyone seemed to be rushing for that boat. A few men who crowded in were turned back at the point of Captain Smith's revolver, and several of them were felled before order was restored. I recall being pushed towards one of the boats and being helped in."
 In the wake of the tragedy, Sir Duff-Gordon received criticism for not adhering to the ship's "women and children first" evacuation policy.
 A few years later in 1915, Lady Duff-Gordon escaped death again after canceling her voyage on the doomed Lusitania.

If the coronavirus has left a hole in Kashif Siddiqi's life, it is not because sport has come to a standstill but that it has forced his recovery from injury into DIY mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "It is a bit crazy because we are in lockdown," says the British footballer who has joined Real Kashmir FC, placed fourth in the 2019-20 I-League, on loan from Oxford United.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "I have a gym at home. I am following what I was doing previously but now I have to do it on my own. Since I had ruptured by Achilles tendon, I need a lot of ultrasound and infra-red treatment and I can't do it," says Siddiqi, 34, over the phone from his home in Stratford-upon-Avon, around an hour's drive from Oxford.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The difference between the shutdown in England and India, says Siddiqi, is that you are allowed to go out once every day for exercise while maintaining social distancing norms. "It is possible it will get stricter next week. We haven't reached the peak yet."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A string of injuries contributed to a career which began at Arsenal's youth team and continued in the USA while he worked on a MBA never taking off beyond a senior international for Pakistan in 2008. "It could have been India as they were also looking for South Asians in Europe but I would have had to give up British citizenship," says the full back who can also play in midfield.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     So Siddiqi uses football to ask the planet to give peace a chance and raise gender equality. It was an idea spurred by what his Ugandan-born mother had to go through during Idi Amin's reign. "She came to England as a refugee," he says. Siddiqi's father is an Indian from Lucknow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In 2011, he set up the Kashif Siddiqi Foundation to help increase the presence of British South Asians in football. Two years later, Siddiqi co-founded Football For Peace (FFP) with Fifa Legend Elias Figueroa, a three-time South America Footballer of The Year and a defender with Chile in three World Cups (1966, 1974 and 1982). FFP works with 6000 children in England alone; Pele is a charity ambassador.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Siddiqi's other job has taken him to Afghanistan, meet football legend George Weah as president of Liberia --- a country wracked by civil wars --- members of the royal family in Britain, Monaco and Jordan and Pope Francis in The Vatican; win awards for humanitarian work; involve footballers such as Mesut Oezil and Bacary Sagna in his projects; share the stage with British marathon legend Paula Radcliffe and play five-a-side football with Usain Bolt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Football touches 3.5 billion people and that power can be galvanised in such a strong way." That, Siddiqi says, is not happening in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Responsibility shrugged off?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The football world has a responsibility but its contribution at this stage is minimal. The reactiveness of the football world has been ridiculous. Fifa, FifPro (players' world body) and other organisations should have been in sync. (But) Different people are saying different things like they would in a terror attack," he says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Yes, people who have played are giving some money here, donating. (But) As a collective, I think, football federations, governing bodies can come together and do a lot more."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Fifa, which had cash reserves of over $2.7 billion in 2018, has contributed $10 million (Rs 76 crore approximately) to World Health Organisation's Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund. BCCI, the Indian cricket board, alone has pledged Rs 51 crore to PM-CARES, a relief fund specific to Covid-19 in India.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Manchester United's Marcus Rashford, who has been ahead of the curve with charity work, has said: "I think there have been plenty of occasions, for me personally, where we have tried to help but we have not helped in the best way possible."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Footballers in the cash-rich Premiership have formed a charity fund to help Britain's National Health Service and Southampton's players, coaching staff and directors have agreed to defer wages till June. But Tottenham Hotspur, which posted profits of nearly 70 million pound last year, have imposed a 20% pay cut and sought government help to pay salaries of non-playing staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Definitely don't agree with furlough for top line football clubs. That means we are looking after players but not (non-playing) staff. It is a team environment, if one goes, everyone has to go. Can't isolate," says Siddiqi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Britain being forced indoors, however, has "arm-twisted" an FFP programme in London involving 3000 children to migrate to a digital platform. "Through football we are trying to talk about equality and social justice to youth who have had a past in dealing with drugs and crime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "At a time of isolation and lack of mental activity, we can engage children on the importance of health, nutrition and mental well-being through football. That aspect of the game is very important," he says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Siddiqi was to join Real Kashmir before the 2019-20 I-League but got injured two days before he was due to fly out. He won't be ready before next season but says the move, "made sense at so many levels."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "This team gets young boys, girls, old women, ordinary people, the police and the military --- with whom ordinary people often have a difficult relationship --- together for 90 minutes. This team gives people hope. That is football for peace."

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The OPEC oil cartel and nations including Russia have agreed to boost oil prices by cutting as much as 10 million barrels a day in production, or a tenth of global supply. More countries, including the United States, were discussing Friday their own cuts in what would be an unprecedented global pact to stabilize the market.The agreement between OPEC and partner countries aims to cut 10 million barrels per day until July, then 8 million barrels per day through the end of the year, and 6 million a day for 16 months beginning in 2021.Mexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said Friday that he had agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.S. will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.That paves the way for cuts that experts estimate could reach 15 million barrels a day in all - about 15% of world production. Such a move would be unprecedented both in its size and the number of participating countries, many of whom have long been bitter rivals in the energy industry.The price of crude is down by over 50% since the start of the year and while that helps consumers and energy-hungry businesses, it is below the cost of production for many countries and companies. That has strained the budgets of oil-producing nations, many of which are developing economies, and it has pushed private companies in the U.S. toward bankruptcy.Analysts warn even these proposed cuts may not be enough to offset the loss in demand over the longer term, as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated demand for energy around the world.“COVID-19 is an unseen beast that seems to be impacting everything in its path,” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said at the start of the meeting, according to a statement. “There is a grizzly shadow hanging over all of us. We do not want this shadow to envelope us. It will have a crushing and long-term impact on the entire industry.”One breakthrough came after Mexico relented in its opposition to the deal, in which it was being asked to cut its output by 400,000 barrels a day. Mexican President Obrador said his country will instead cut its production by 100,000 barrels per day from its current level of 1.7 million barrels a day. The U.S. will add a cut of 250,000 barrels per day to what it has already agreed.More nations were expected to add to the effort, with Saudi Arabia chairing a Group of 20 virtual meeting of energy ministers on Friday to discuss the oversupply in the market.The meeting is expected to bring onboard a wider number of countries, including the United States. Saudi media quoted Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as saying in his opening remarks that the pandemic means it is more vital than ever that reliable and affordable energy supplies are available. The meeting also includes representatives of OPEC.Trump has spoken earlier with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia about the negotiations. The United States is interested in a deal because the oil price crash has caused thousands of job losses in the oil patch just as the virus outbreak is causing a record spike in unemployment.“There’s so much production nobody even knows what to do with it, that’s how it’s working,” Trump said at a White House news briefing.The oil market was already oversupplied when Russia and OPEC failed to agree on output cuts in early March. Analysts say Russia refused to back even a moderate cut because it would have only served to help U.S. energy companies that were pumping at full capacity. Stalling would hurt American shale-oil producers and protect market share.Russia’s move enraged Saudi Arabia, which not only said it would not cut production on its own but said it would increase output instead and reduce its selling prices in what became effectively a global pricing war.In the time since, prices have collapsed as the coronavirus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have largely halted global travel. International benchmark Brent crude traded Friday over $31 a barrel while the U.S. benchmark West Texas crude traded under $23.Russia relies on oil as the main source of income and the price collapse caused the ruble to crash. That boosted the cost of imports and sped up inflation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin views “very positively” the result of the negotiations and added that Russia welcomes Mexico’s decision to join the deal.The agreement is a win for everyone, the world’s economy would have “plunged into chaos” if the deal had been broken off, Peskov added.Analysts warn the proposed 10 million barrel per day cut for May and June will not be enough to offset plummeting demand for oil globally and runs the risk of coming too late as storage capacity for oil nears its maximum. Even if North American producers took 5 million barrels a day off the market, there could still be an excess supply of 5-10 million barrels per day.Research firm Rystad Energy estimates the imbalance for April is 27.4 million barrels per day. The firm says global storage of crude is already close to being filled to the brim, estimating that on average 79% of the world’s oil storage capacity is already full. Around 7.4 billion barrels of crude and products are in storage, including 1.3 billion currently on board tankers at sea.Chris Midgley, global head of analytics for S&amp;P Global Platts, said the proposed cuts are unlikely to have any significant impact on April supply, and thus run the risk of getting close to exhausting all available storage in May.However, a cut of 10-15 million barrels per day is enough to prop up oil prices and helps to reduce strain on crude storage facilities, analysts said.___Associated Press writers Daria Litvinova and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Cathy Bussewitz in New York, Aya Batrawy in Dubai and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Wright told the club’s official website: “Obviously it was disappointing not to be involved in the Betfred Cup knockout rounds but we’ve been working hard on the training pitch and had a bounce game last week against Arbroath too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We’ve been working hard on fitness and also our game plan for tomorrow’s match so we’re well prepared. Now it’s up to the players to take that onto the pitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Easter Road has been a happy hunting ground for us in recent years but we know it’s going to be a difficult game. Hibs are very attack-minded and have added to their squad well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “(Glenn) Middleton has come in from Rangers and both he and (Daryl) Horgan looked good last weekend. They’ve got (Stevie) Mallan and Scott Allan in the midfield as well who are creative players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “However I always feel you get the chance to play when you face Hibs. You have a chance to get on the ball and create opportunities and it’s not like playing away at Celtic Park for example where you don’t get a lot of possession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “They’ve looked good going forward but they have conceded quite a few goals and hopefully we can exploit that on Saturday.”

After the rescue mission, the Malta government said in a statement that it could no longer help migrants in distress at sea trying to reach Europe from northern Africa.

The mission is now thought of as one of the greatest exercises in human ingenuity, improvisation and on-the-fly decision-making. It is taught in business school crisis-management classes, and is enshrined alongside Apollos 8 and 11 as part the great triptych of American space exploration. As for all those later missions that did succeed in landing on the moon--Apollos 14, 15, 16 and 17? Footnotes to the one that didn't.

There was something far more troubling here. We're going to get to the bottom of it. And if people broke the law and we can establish that with the evidence, they will be prosecuted… What happened to him was one of the greatest travesties in American history — without any basis. They started this investigation of his campaign. And even more concerning, actually, is what happened after the campaign. A whole pattern of events while he was president… to sabotage the presidency… or at least have the effect of sabotaging the presidency.
