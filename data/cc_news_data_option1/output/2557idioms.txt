“Because of the nature of the allegations, we have a formal process and policy in place, and we’re going to execute that as it’s written. We’re always looking to ensure due process is afforded to everyone.”


  Reed is hopeful an investigation process creates firm and permanent change in his hometown community. Reed also sees himself as the harbinger of this change.


  Before Reed worked at the UI, he held jobs with the American Cancer Society as a fundraiser and MLB’s Chicago White Sox as part of its non-profit community relations arm.


  It was through the latter role that Reed said he gained “a much greater appreciation for people who are dealing with circumstances more challenging than my own.”


  He takes that to his current job, which involves promoting inclusivity at a major university.


  “Opportunities for me to make the society I live in a better place,” Reed said, “are always something I’m going to jump on.”


  With Georgetown being a relatively small community, Reed said he recognizes “there’s not a lot of structured activity outside of school and sports for kids to do.” As such, kids’ worldview is most likely to be shaped by those they meet through school and sports.


  That’s another reason why Reed was so troubled by Cavanaugh’s alleged behavior.


  “What kind of example is the school district setting by allowing a man like Josh Cavanaugh to have an impression on our kids?” Reed said. “What kind of message is that sending to our community?”


  Reed said he’s pleased with the response his petition has received, given the number of signatures compared to Georgetown’s population.


  “All of those (signatures) aren’t community members,” Reed said. “I really want to, as much as possible, bring awareness to this issue and hopefully encourage others who have stories to share them, to come forward.


  “It’s intimidating. Some of those people are working in the school district now. Some of them have daily interactions with the stakeholders involved in this situation. People who are in vulnerable places can’t necessarily come forward as visibly as I. I fully understand that, and I’m doing what I can to emphasize their voices.”


  Reed said he "can't with any certainty speculate" on whether or not any of the allegations he's received extend to parties beyond Cavanaugh. He only noted that school officials have been made aware of past alleged abuses, such as one that Reed wrote in his change.org petition led to Cavanaugh's first resignation as G-RF football coach. That event, Reed wrote, allegedly involved Cavanaugh telling a student he was "going to kill him and his mother if he didn't shut up."


  Cavanaugh was rehired as G-RF football coach prior to the 2017 season. Neal said Cavanaugh still holds his positions as the Buffaloes’ girls’ track and field coach and assistant principal at Mary Miller Junior High.


  Neal noted that Cavanaugh did resign when he left G-RF football in 2013, though she said “that would be something you’d need to ask Mr. Cavanaugh” when asked why he stepped down seven years ago.


  Reed said he heard from Neal last weekend, about a week after the school board meeting on June 20, which abruptly ended minutes after Reed’s comments, when both Neal and school board president Mike Gragert appeared to experience technological difficulties in the virtual meeting. Gragert appeared to have such issues throughout the meeting.


  “We were able to sit down (Monday),” Reed said of Neal, “and I shared a multi-page document of complaints shared with me from victims and witnesses. An investigation is underway.”


  Neal told the News-Gazette that “at Georgetown-Ridge Farm schools, we do not condone racism, sexism or anything of that nature.”


  Gragert said in an email to The News-Gazette that “due to the critical and sensitive nature of this situation it would be inappropriate for me to offer any public comment at this time.” Cavanaugh has not responded to multiple requests for comment.


  “At the end of the day, I’m more of a PR person in this process. I’m not a stakeholder, current or future,” Reed said. “As far as my influence can reach, I’m willing to take on the task. But at the end of the day, the community really has to stand up and say, ‘(Cavanaugh) doesn’t represent our values as a community, and we don’t want him here to negatively impact our students, our teachers, our parents, our volunteers, our stakeholders.”


  That this upheaval is occurring during highly-publicized movements such as “Black Lives Matter” and “Me Too,” which work against racial injustice and sexual abuse, respectively, also is poignant in Reed’s eyes.


  “As a nation, we’re being challenged to take a look in the mirror and look at our family and look at our places of employment, asking ourselves, ‘Are we reflective of the values that we say we have?’” Reed said. “If I can enact that change in my hometown, I think that’s a great example for others to take on. Especially as a young Black man, if I can do something that enacts possible change, I think it really hopefully is of motivation to others who want to make change in their communities as well.”

During the series all eyes would be on Rohit, who had scored three hundreds including a double century against South Africa at home in his debut series as Test opener last October. He, however, missed two games in New Zealand due to a calf injury."It's going to test any batsman in the world, but I think because he's (Rohit) played a lot of One-Day cricket batting at the top of the order, and now he's been having some success with the red ball game as well, that'll give him confidence coming in," Hussey said."I have no doubt in my mind that he's got the ability and the skill and the temperament, to be able to handle it."The former Australia left-handed batsman said the key for Rohit would be adaptability to the Australian conditions."I think he would adapt. No, worries at all of his batting at the top of the order. It will be challenging in Australian conditions against the top quality bowling attack with pace and bounce," Hussey said.The 45-year-old left-handed batsman feels return of the duo of Steve Smith and David Warner will make life difficult for the Indians in the upcoming series.Smith and Warner missed India's historic away Test series win over Australia in 2018 because of their one-year bans for their involvement in the infamous ball-tampering episode in South Africa.In the absence of the duo, India recorded their first Test series win Down Under in 2018-19."Obviously, bringing back Smith and Warner into the team is huge, but the guys that were exposed and perhaps probably weren't quite ready at the time from two years ago, have now managed to get a number of Test matches under their belt... India are going to be up for a stiff challenge in Australia this summer," Hussey said in a chat show on Sony Ten's Pit Stop."Put that with a world class bowling attack in Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazelwood and (James) Pattinson as well with Nathan Lyon...I think the team looks extremely strong, they are playing some excellent Test cricket. We know India are a world class team, but they have to be at their best to beat the Australian team on home soil." Hussey feels the absence of the two key batsmen, Smith and Warner, exposed the young Australians to the rigours of Test cricket."They basically had to either sink or swim and someone like (Travis) Head I think has really shown a lot of character, a lot of guts and a lot of fight in grabbing hold of his opportunity and he's performed pretty well," he said.Post the sandpaper gate scandal, Hussey feels the Australian team has worked extremely hard to gain their respect back."The team copped up a lot of stick, lost a lot of respect in the cricket community here in Australia and all around the world. They've worked extremely hard over the last couple of years to gain the respect back from the cricket community, by the way they play and the way they conduct themselves and I think Tim Paine's led that really well," he said.The Chennai Super Kings-player-turned-batting consultant further hailed 'Captain Cool' MS Dhoni, saying he should be allowed to take a call on his career."He's been an incredible person and player for CSK for so long, and India for that matter, and we hope he keeps playing for another 10 years but I'm not sure we're going to be able to see that so hopefully he can play for as long as he can."Post India's World Cup semifinal exit in 2019, Dhoni has been on a sabbatical with speculation surrounding his career.Hussey also admired the way Virat Kohli respects the presence of Dhoni in the team and the chemistry the duo shares."I think you got to give a lot of kudos to Virat Kohli, having someone like MS Dhoni still in the team who's been, arguably, India's most successful captain. Sometimes some people would find that threatening to still have that person in the team," he said."But I think that's where you need to tip your hat to Virat and so you know he's obviously got the personality to say 'no, no I would like this guy around. I can learn from this guy, and he's going to help me get down the better skipper and obviously have a better team'," he signed off.",

As a pitcher, Colton Johnson knows when not to bite on a breaking pitch, even one of his own slurvy curve balls -- and because of the coronavirus pandemic, this baseball season's been nothing but one off-speed pitch after another.


   


  So, the 6-foot-4 left hander decided to return to Illinois State University, work on his graduate degree and take advantage of the NCAA's offer of additional eligibility for spring sports athletes. He'll be 22 when he suits up for the Redbirds in 2021.


   


  "I turned down an offer after the draft," said Johnson. "It wasn't enough."


   


  The majors conducted a trimmed down draft this season, selecting only 160 players. Afterward, teams could only offer $20,000 signing bonuses to undrafted free agents.


   


  Johnson is the son of Greg Johnson and Mary Bates of Kewanee. At Kewanee High School, he was team MVP his senior season, went 8-2 with 149 strikeouts and was a big reason the team won its first regional title since 1945.


   


  For Illinois State, he'd become a "go-to" arm. He was the team's only returning all-conference pitcher. Before the spring season was cut off, he'd started four games, made five appearances, thrown 25 innings and had 37 strikeouts and a 3.60 earned run average.


   


  Next season, the majors will likely return to the 40-round draft. Even if their assessment of Johnson's arm remains unchanged, Johnson feels he'll be in a better place.


   


  "Probably, it'll be the same, money-wise," he said. "I'll have a year of my masters done and only miss three months of professional baseball."


   


  If he misses any. There is no indication the minor leagues will be playing this summer and there only a handful of college leagues up and running.


   


  Even so, this decision gives him time to retool, improve his arsenal of off- speed pitches to counter his reliable fastball, hit the weight room and refocus. Oh, and get a lease on a new place to stay.


   


  "I've been throwing with a group; we get out to the mound every Friday," said Johnson. "There's a lot of professional guys around here year-round. I just joined right in with them."


   


  On the academic side, he'll be able to get a masters in sports management, which is his preferred vocation. "I've a bachelor's in finance," he said. "It's a good degree, but I had no idea what I was getting into. Sports management is more up my alley."


   


  His plan is to give his arm a break during July, concentrating on just lifting weights. There is also the scrubbing floors part, which he'll do as a part-time worker at Neponset schools.


   


  "I might not completely shut down," he said. "Couple times a week, I'll try to get some work in. Our throwing program starts in late July/early August. I'll just slowly get in game shape. Work 1 inning, then two. It's a slow thing."


   


  If there was one game where Johnson showed his potential it was Feb 21 against No. 16-ranked Oklahoma. Johnson dueled Nationals' draft pick Cade Cavalli, who was on the mound for the Sooners. Both went seven innings; Johnson had 10 strikeouts, two walks and gave up four hits while Cavalli had nine Ks, a walk and six hits allowed. Oklahoma won 2-1.


   


  Johnson followed that up with an inning of work for a save that closed out an 8-7 win against No. 13-ranked Arkansas on March 3.


   


  In fact, closing out a senior season properly is all part of the reason Johnson is coming back to Illinois State.


   


  "My experience at ISU has been a blast for me," he said. "Obviously, some good feelings about going back."

"Every game is going to be a must-win game from now because we have a few teams ahead of us so the margin for error is minimal," said Arteta.


  Wednesday's meeting with Norwich is Arsenal's first competitive game at Emirates Stadium since March, as they returned from lockdown with four away games - at Manchester City, Brighton and Southampton in the Premier League, and then at Sheffield United in the FA Cup on Sunday.


  The north London side had collected 13 points from five homes games immediately prior to the coronavirus shutdown, though Arteta accepts home advantage is now partly diminished by the absence of supporters.


  "At home we have to be very strong if we have any chance of finishing in European places," said the Spaniard.


  "We really want to play at home; that's where we enjoy [playing] more. But obviously, not having the fans is a tremendous disadvantage."


  Arteta also confirmed that defender William Saliba will sign a loan extension at Saint-Etienne so he can play in the French Cup final against Paris St- Germain on July 24.


  Saliba, 19, joined Arsenal from Saint-Etienne last summer before immediately being loaned back to the French club.


  "He's been over there all year, he's earned his right to play that final if the manager wants to do that," Arteta said.


  "We have to give him the opportunity to do that, to enjoy that and we'll have him after."

Volleyball coaches? They’ve always been forced into a hands-off role in the summer months. A pandemic didn’t change that.


  “We will not be getting the same opportunity,” Tamas said. “A little bit disappointing to see because we lost out on our biggest developmental phase of the season. But, OK, it is what it is. We told them once this first hit back in March that this was going to be a year unlike any other.


  “We just need to be prepared to be comfortable with having to change on the fly. We talk about being adaptable a lot. We’ll accept the challenge like we do with all the rest, and we’ll be ready for whatever day they say we’re allowed to play.”


  The development phase Illinois missed was its spring practice schedule. Illinois, then the Big Ten and then the NCAA, halted all organized team activities the second week of March.


  The Illini were supposed to play their first spring match on March 28 at Lipscomb — an opportunity for junior defensive specialist Taylor Kuper to play against older sister, Megan. Two more matches and a tournament were to follow, including a showdown with Notre Dame at Mother McAuley High School in Chicago, an all-day tournament at Bradley and a lone home match against Illinois State at Huff Hall.


  Tamas was counting on those spring practices to rework the roster and at least start on figuring out a lineup for the 2020 season after the Illini finished 16-14 during the 2019 season that saw a third straight NCAA tournament appearance, albeit one coupled with a first-round NCAA tournament loss.

As was the case at the weekend, there will be no supporters inside the City Ground as the remaining games will take place behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 A number of measures have also been put in place to ensure stadiums are as safe an environment as possible.
 Lamouchi admits it is a situation which takes some getting used to, although he has been surprised by the tempo in his team’s first two games since the season resumed from a three-month suspension.
 “It is difficult for all managers, all teams and all players, so I don’t want to complain,” he said.
 “It is not the same playing without fans and there are different protocols. It is absolutely different.

Eliminating recycling in a city of our size would do detrimental damage to not only our landfill and our reputation, but also to our citizenry. It would reverse years of educational effort that has driven consumer action to such a high participation rate in the curbside recycling program. If recycling were eliminated completely and revisited years down the road as suggested during a recent city board discussion, the cost to re-educate the population to the point of 70% recycling participation would be great.

In its attempt to repair this tear in the aspirational nation, the CCP employed a strategy known as the United Front. In Amdo, simply put, this referred to a transitional period of indeterminate length during which class struggle would be de-emphasized in favour of forming alliances with the region’s religious and secular elite. Unlike traditional imperial practices, however, the United Front was imagined as a 'gradual,' 'voluntary' and 'organic' method of nation building. By eliminating the exploitation Amdo Tibetans and others allegedly had suffered under the Ma regime and its predecessors, and replacing it with the autonomy, equality, religious freedom, mutual respect, and material prosperity promised by the CCP, Party leaders confidently predicted that both class awareness and patriotic consciousness would rise and eventually the masses themselves would indicate that they were ready for the transition to socialism and to be fully integrated into the PRC.

New Timberland High School football coach Greg Wright has been dealt lemons but they’re making lemonade out in St. Stephen.
 Phasing in to football season with safety guidelines to follow because of COVID-19, including social distancing, has not allowed football teams to hit the ground running this summer but Wright and company aren’t complaining. They’re making the best out of a situation that is less than ideal.
 “We’ve had some really good numbers,” said Wright, a former Cross High School player who took over for Art Craig. “We’ve had some good leadership. It helps when you’ve got some coaches who have been there for years. They know the kids. That’s helped with the transition.”
 Seven current assistants stayed on after Art Craig left for Hanahan High School. Wright, who was at Denmark-Olar, might be able to add one or two more as school approaches in August.
 “I love the organization of how we have things right now,” Wright said. “With smaller groups, you can slow it down and be more detailed. It’s very important for us because we’re coming up with a new system with some new terminology. It’s been beneficial for us, getting our kids to understand the concepts and making sure everybody is teaching and seeing the same thing.”
 The energy level has been high each day. The Wolves have won 14 region titles in 15 seasons and finished in the third round of the playoffs for the fourth straight season last year.
 “We’ve been having great practices,” Wright said. “These kids are motivated.”
 As June turned into July, though, Berkeley County School District fall sports programs were still in phase one of their return to sports. Phase two would bring in more sports equipment but with positive COVID-19 cases reported by the state over 1,000 each day recently, football season still seems a long way off.
 There has even been talk of flipping the seasons and having spring sports in the fall and vice versa.
 “I hope we’re going to get football (in the fall),” Wright said. “We’re praying that we will. We understand it’s a serious matter. We’re taking precautions, making sure our kids are safe at all times. That’s the most important thing. We do hope we can get back to normalcy but that remains to be seen.”

“The last three months have been a whirlwind of emotions while trying to establish a new routine, but I was thankful to spend that time with my family at home in Tuscola,” Day said. “The extra time spent with family was refreshing, but also a bit stressful as I was still in classes and adjusting to all of my coursework being moved to an online format. As time went on and I established a routine at home, I became more conscious of my emotions starting to settle and not worrying so much about all of the unknowns.”


  Softball helped. Even if she didn’t have a catcher to throw to or opposing hitters she was trying to strike out.


  “The facility I normally worked out in Tuscola was closed because of the coronavirus, but the Tuscola High School softball field was still open,” Day said. “My family would sometimes be busy with their own activities, so, in the spirit of social distancing from others, I utilized the open field by myself and set up a net behind the plate to throw into. There was also a new bullpen recently installed at the high school field, so I was happy to utilize that as well and help break it in. Rain or shine, warm or cold, I enjoyed having that time to pitch on my own for fun as a form of stress relief.”


  She stayed connected with her teammates and friends, too, via Zoom calls, social media and other means of technology.


  “It was quite the transition being away from them while at home considering we are basically one big family and spent nearly all of our time together on campus,” Day said. “We had weekly video calls with the team and the whole coaching staff. We covered a number of topics, including how we each spent our time to stay busy at home and cope with the loss of the second half of the season.”


  Pitching to imaginary hitters hasn’t taken up all of Day’s time amid the pandemic. A former cross-country runner in high school, Day has picked up running again. She has walked her dog. Helped her family clean, organize and get rid of old or unused items for donation.


  She also has picked up a long-time hobby again on a more consistent basis.


  “I spent a lot of time working on art projects and painting,” Day said. “I painted a few commission pieces on canvas, a pair of jeans and repurposed a few items around my home, but I found great joy in the ability to express myself in a creative outlet while I actually had the free time.”


  Day still has another season left at Illinois State. Two, in fact, if she chooses to accept the extra year of eligibility the NCAA granted to all spring sport athletes in 2020 because of the pandemic.


  For now, though, she’ll focus on celebrating her 21st birthday on Wednesday, staying in pitching shape and focusing on her academics. The public relations major is set to earn her bachelor’s degree in May 2021, with plans to find a nonclinical position with a communications department at a hospital in the future.


  “I have always had an interest in the medical field, but had a natural knack for communications,” Day said. “I am hopeful to get the best of both worlds.”


  And she’s hopeful she gets to dig into a pitching rubber again, stare in to her catcher’s glove, uncork her powerful delivery and try to strike out an opposing hitter while playing for Illinois State next spring.


  “I will never take a single pitch for granted again,” Day said. “There will come a day in my life where I am no longer playing softball, and not being able to play for the rest of the 2020 season has made me grateful for each and every opportunity that I am still able to step onto the field and into the circle.”


  When she does, she’ll know she’s not just pitching for her school. Or her teammates. Tuscola will be keeping tabs, too, on her progress.


  “Coming from a small town to playing at the Division I level has been an absolute dream come true for me,” Day said. “I hope to serve as a role model for younger athletes that also come from smaller towns in hopes to gain athletic attention from Division I schools. I want to use my platform as a student-athlete to inspire athletes that they can truly achieve anything they want to, regardless of where they come from. You don’t have to come from a big place to compete on a big stage.”

WASHINGTON -- Healthcare groups were generally positive -- with some exceptions -- about Monday's 5-4 Supreme Court decision striking down a Louisiana abortion law, a law that critics say would have forced all but one of the state's abortion clinics to close.Today, obstetrician- gynecologists from around the country celebrate the Supreme Court's decision that will help protect the ability of their patients to receive essential care and that affirms physicians' roles in advocating for their patients, Maureen Phipps, MD, MPH, CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), said in a statement. Once again, just as in 2016, the court has declared that placing onerous, unreasonable requirements on physicians and clinicians who provide abortion creates an unconstitutional burden on patients in violation of the U.S. Constitution.While ACP [the American College of Physicians] recognizes and is respectful of different views that individuals, including physicians and patients, have on these issues, ACP believes that a woman has the right to make health care decisions about matters that affect her personal, individual health, the college said in a statement, noting that it was pleased with the decision. Reproductive health care services should be treated like other medical services in America. Placing unnecessary barriers that do not increase patient safety in the way of those seeking these kinds of procedures serves only to interfere in physicians providing needed care to patients. The ACP was one of several physician organizations, including the American Medical Association and ACOG, that submitted a friend of the court brief on behalf of the abortion clinics.2014 Law at IssueThe case of June Medical Services v. Gee involves a Louisiana law passed in 2014, which would bar doctors from providing abortion services in the state unless they have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they provide abortion care. Louisiana currently has three abortion clinics; there were about 10,000 abortions performed in the state last year, with a complication rate close to zero, attorney Julie Rikelman, JD, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the clinics, said on a teleconference with reporters.The Louisiana law, known as Act 620, is identical to a Texas law in another Supreme Court case, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. The high court struck down the Texas law in 2016.In finding for the plaintiff, the Supreme Court agreed with the opinions expressed by the federal district court in Louisiana, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. These include its determination that Louisiana's law poses a 'substantial obstacle' to women seeking an abortion; its determination that the law offers no significant health-related benefits; and its determination that the law consequently imposes an 'undue burden' on a woman's constitutional right to choose to have an abortion. We also agree with its ultimate legal conclusion that, in light of these findings and our precedents, Act 620 violates the Constitution. Breyer was joined in his opinion by justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan.In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said he believed the Whole Woman's Health case was wrongly decided, but that The question today, however, is not whether Whole Woman's Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case ... The legal doctrine of stare decisis [to stand by things decided] requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike. The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore Louisiana's law cannot stand under our precedents.Question of Standing Both Breyer and Roberts disagreed with arguments that the clinic physicians did not have standing to bring the lawsuit because they weren't the patients on whom the procedure was performed. The plaintiffs are abortion providers challenging a law that regulates their conduct, Breyer wrote. The 'threatened imposition of governmental sanctions' for noncompliance eliminates any risk that their claims are abstract or hypothetical.That threat also assures us that the plaintiffs have every incentive to 'resist efforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function,' he continued. And, since they are the ones who would have to apply for admitting privileges, they are, in other words, 'the least awkward' and most 'obvious' claimants here. Roberts said in a footnote in his opinion that because of that reasoning, I agree that the abortion providers in this case have standing to assert the constitutional rights of their patients.Justice Clarence Thomas disagreed with that idea. The abortion providers' sole claim before this court is that Louisiana's law violates the purported substantive due process right of a woman to abort her unborn child, he wrote in a dissenting opinion. But they concede that this right does not belong to them, and they seek to vindicate no private rights of their own. Under a proper understanding of Article III, these plaintiffs lack standing to invoke our jurisdiction. Furthermore, our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled. Because we have neither jurisdiction nor constitutional authority to declare Louisiana's duly enacted law unconstitutional, I respectfully dissent.Anti-Abortion Ob/Gyns Weigh InThe American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists also was unhappy with the decision. As professional practitioners of Hippocratic Medicine, we call for medical accountability. Cases like those in Bethesda last month show a pressing need for abortionists to have hospital admitting privileges, the association said in a statement, referring to a story posted on LifeSite, an anti-abortion rights news publication, about two late-term abortion procedures, at a clinic in Bethesda, Maryland, in which the patients required hospital treatment.This is important so that women can receive the timely life-saving care they need in case of complications, and also so that there is accountability for the abortion providers to ensure they are competent. We're disappointed by today's Supreme Court decision. Lives are at stake.The White House called the ruling unfortunate. The Supreme Court devalued both the health of mothers and the lives of unborn children by gutting Louisiana's policy that required all abortion procedures be performed by individuals with admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, said a statement from the press secretary's office. States have legitimate interests in regulating any medical procedure -- including abortions -- to protect patient safety. Instead of valuing fundamental democratic principles, unelected justices have intruded on the sovereign prerogatives of state governments by imposing their own policy preference in favor of abortion to override legitimate abortion safety regulations.Despite today's decision, the battle over abortion rights will continue, Rikelman said, noting that the center is currently contesting 30 other state laws that restrict abortions, including several in the state of Louisiana. Among these are laws extending the waiting period for abortions to 72 hours and those outlawing D&amp;E [dilation and evacuation] abortions, which are the standard of care in procedures performed after 15 weeks, she said.

Gem Studios held one of its Paint it Forward fundraisers on June 6 and directed the money raised to Big Brothers, Big Sisters. Over a Zoom meeting Ty McClellan, area director, accepted the donation of $325. Donations are always appreciated but this year it came on the heels of the organization having to cancel its largest annual fundraiser.
 “Bowl for Kids Sake is our single biggest statewide fundraiser of the year,” he said. “It accounts for about a third of our fundraising to support our operational budget. Losing that has been significant and has left us trying to remedy the situation through alternative fundraising events.”
 Moving forward nonprofits are contending with no-gathering orders, which prevents large fundraisers and a shrinking economy. The businesses that sponsor and support the work of charities are hoping to make it through the pandemic with their doors open — sponsorship dollars are tight, he said.
 To compound matters, community needs, which the nonprofits tend to, are increasing.
 “Like all businesses, we too are continually being pressed to do more with less,” he said. “Coming out of this pandemic, the needs are expected to increase quite drastically.”
 In addition to losing financial support, social distancing, or physical distancing as the Council for Nonprofits prefers to call it, has charities trying to balance safety with their missions.
 “We can’t sacrifice the quality or the safety of our existing matches,” McClellan said. “Nor do we want to stop enrolling new youth or mentors.”
 One-on-one relationships is the crux of Big Brothers, Big Sisters.
 The mission of Big Brothers Big Sisters is to match youth facing adversity with caring adult mentors outside of their home. That description itself, calls for actions not allowed with COVID-19.
 “The very basis for our program is to be able to meet in person,” he said. “While virtual, has proven to be very effective in navigating this pandemic there is no replacing the in-person meetings.”
 Big Brothers, Big Sisters is not alone in its scrambling to figure out how to will move forward.
 Jill Nelson, executive director of Delivering Change and her husband Dave was the ambassador family for the Kansas Infant Death and SIDS network in Wichita, Kansas for its Step Up For Kids.
 The 5K run ended up being a virtual event. Instead of everyone gathering, running together, cheering each other on and having fellowship, participants did the run on their own and uploaded photos to social media.
 “We weren’t able to all gather and talk,” she said. “Part of that is the social aspect of being together with other families. Dave and I are both on the board for the Kid’s Network — the fact that it wasn’t held in person, we actually had really good registration, but you still take a hit on your what you project is your bottom line”
 Delivering Change’s annual community baby shower had to be canceled and she had to put a hold on the prenatal education classes. However, the need for the classes has not diminished. Starting July 6, Nelson said they will move them to a virtual format.
 “We’re going to give it a whirl and see how it goes,” she said. “It’s really hard to interface with our patients and our clients, virtually. There’s just something about that face-to-face interaction.”
 Fiscally Delivering Change is in a better position than some non-profits because they are a Kansas Permanent Health and Environment grantee, which provides them with a steady operating stream. Additionally, the Kansas Health Foundation freed up about $2.1 million for immediate relief funding, she said.
 “We were fortunate … we applied for some of that and were lucky to be awarded some financial dollars there,” she said.
 But the money nor Zoom meetings can replace the interaction people need — the hug, the smile, the one-on-one support, McClellan and Nelson said.
 “There’s science and research behind what a hug can do,” Mclellan said.
 The local BBBS has 130 active matches and 140 children on a waiting list to be matched with an adult mentor. While COVID-19 has disrupted his work, he continues to search out and match adults with children who need a positive influencer in their lives. Many of the children enrolled in the program live in poverty and often face some form of abuse, he said.
 “We know there’s urgent needs, like when somebody needs food or mental care — I’m never going to downplay that kind of stuff — ever but what we try to tell people is when you invest in Big Brothers, Big Sisters, you are breaking generational cycles of poverty and abuse and you’re building a stronger community,” he said.
 Moving forward nonprofits will have to get creative, work together and stay focused on their goals and the people they serve because at the end of the day — people and relationships are what is important, he said.
 They are looking for ways for the mentors to stay in touch with their littles.
 “They need that friendship,” McClellan said. “Friendship is not canceled during this time.”

It is understood the people targeted were all from ethnic minority backgrounds.
 ## Threats of violence
 The letter, which was not addressed to Mr Yaqub personally, stated it was sent by a militia group and made a number of threats of violence to anyone who was "a woman or man and was born in another country".
 Mr Yaqub said it was opened by his wife and the manager of his shop, adding that reading it had left them "shaken up".
 "I tried to take on the burden to calm them down and joked 'don't worry, it can't be serious as they haven't put a first class stamp on it'."
 However, he said after reading it he "just couldn't believe it".
 "I'm born and bred here [and] I've never seen this kind of literature before.
 "I was thinking 'where do I belong?' For me - England, Pendle, Lancashire - this is my country."
 He said those responsible were "only a minority", adding: "I think they are wired wrong."
 The residents of Mellor, where he has lived for 10 years, are "beautiful people", he said.
 Det Insp Andy Horne said the letters were not thought to pose a direct threat to any individual and officers were investigating a link to a number of others received by post offices across the county in December.
 A Post Office spokesman said the company was supporting the police effort "to apprehend those responsible".

A theme has emerged in recent weeks as college athletes have begun to speak out against racial inequality both inside and outside their locker rooms.


   


  At Oklahoma State, star running back Chuba Hubbard threatened to step away from the team after coach Mike Gundy was photographed wearing a T-shirt with the logo of the controversial OAN television network.


   


  At Iowa, long-time football strength coach Chris Doyle left the program after facing widespread accusations of bullying and disparagement by former players, particularly Black men.


   


  At Clemson, football coach Dabo Swinney had to defend how he dealt with assistant Danny Pearman uttering a racial slur during a 2017 practice.


   


  All three of those coaches are white.


   


  Even many of the positive stories of college coaches supporting their Black athletes -- like Kentucky football coach Mark Stoops leading a Black Lives Matters march for his team in Lexington -- have centered around white coaches.


   


  All too often absent from the conversation about college sports and race have been Black head coaches.


   


  Not because they are silent, but mostly because colleges still have woeful records of hiring Black coaches, especially at the highest levels across the Power Five conferences.


   


  To gain a better understanding of the racial makeup of college coaches, The Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, counted the Black head coaches and other head coaches of color in each Power Five athletic department (including Notre Dame, which is a member of the ACC in basketball), then confirmed the numbers with each school.


   


  Washington State, Duke and Iowa declined to confirm the racial demographics of their head coaches, and Miami did not respond to multiple emails.


   


  Of the 1,073 head coaches in NCAA sports at Power Five programs, only 79, or 7.4%, are Black.


   


  Of the 65 Power Five schools, 15 do not employ a single Black head coach in any NCAA sport, though seven of those schools do have at least one other head coach of color.


   


  Alabama, Arkansas, Texas A&M;, Iowa State, Texas Tech and Washington State do not list any head coaches of color on their online staff directories. All but six Power Five programs have two or fewer Black head coaches.


   


  In Kentucky, the University of Louisville has just one Black coach, women's tennis coach Mark Beckham, and two other minority head coaches. The University of Kentucky has one Black head coach, track and cross country coach Lonnie Greene, and one other minority coach.


   


  Meanwhile, 19% of athletes in the Power Five conferences were Black in the 2018-19 school year, according to the most recent data available in the NCAA's demographics database.


   


  Representation for Black athletes among their head coaches continues to lag in the NCAA and especially the Power Five conferences.


   


  "I like to think that in the best-case scenario that we hire who we feel comfortable with. That's not a bad thing," Missouri men's basketball coach Cuonzo Martin, who is Black, said. "The other part is, if you were raised a certain way to think that someone is less than you, how do you hire them in a position that is equal to you? If you thought they were less than you, how do you hire them to a position that takes intellect, experience, understanding, knowledge?


   


  "… That's hard to do, and that's why I think we must be diligent and deliberate in our hiring practices, building our programs and continuing the growth. You have to be able to see the numbers over a course of time."


   


  Only one sport has more than 15 Power Five Black head coaches -- track and field.


   


  Football has 11 Black head coaches, women's basketball has 12 and men's basketball has just eight Power Five Black head coaches -- despite the sport being dominated by Black athletes.


   


  According to the NCAA, 51% of men's basketball players in the Power Five conferences were Black in 2019.


   


  That's a disparity that is concerning to many, including Martin.


   


  In Kentucky, one of Louisville coach Chris Mack's three full-time assistants is Black, Mike Pegues. At UK, two of coach John Calipari's three full-time assistants are Black, Kenny Payne and Tony Barbee.


   


  "We're basically not far from where we were 20 years ago," said Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida, which publishes an annual Racial and Gender Report Card for each American professional sports league and the NCAA. "The numbers for head basketball coaches, men's basketball coaches of color, are literally within a percentage point of where they were in 2004, which is the first year we did the modern Racial and Gender Report Card.


   


  "Football coaches are about flat. When you go to other sports obviously, there are even less coaches of color represented. Women's basketball is doing a little better than 20 years ago, but it was doing awful 20 years ago."


   


  It takes no time for Greene, who oversees all six Wildcat track and cross country teams, to rattle off a list of the many Black coaches who have developed national championship contenders in his sport, including former UK coach Edrick Floreal, who now coaches at Texas. But he thinks Black coaches still face greater scrutiny.


   


  "Is that an easy job for them? No, because in my mind we're analyzed a little deeper, under the microscope," Greene said. "We don't have room for error, we don't have room for mistakes. … In my experience, in my time, it isn't easy."


   


  The number of Black head coaches drops off substantially in the remaining sports around the country. There are three coaches of color in women's soccer, softball, volleyball, women's tennis and wrestling; two in gymnastics and one in baseball, beach volleyball, men's soccer, fencing, men's tennis and swimming and diving.


   


  The Courier Journal also asked Power Five schools to share any diversity hiring initiatives within their athletics department.


   


  Several noted the creation of positions within the senior leadership staff focused on diversity or diversity and inclusion committees. Many of the schools with no Black head coaches acknowledged work to be done in their athletic departments in improving diversity.


   


  A Texas spokesman told The Courier Journal the Longhorns have adopted a policy similar to the NFL's Rooney Rule, requiring minority candidates to be interviewed for job openings.


   


  Oregon and Oregon State are subject to a state law requiring qualified minority candidates to be interviewed for head coach or athletic director openings.


   


  Martin, though, isn't a fan of the Rooney Rule. "It shouldn't be whether it's male, female, white, Black or brown, all right, then I'll decide how you're paid. That shouldn't matter."


   


  Lapchick has proposed college sports adopt its own version of the Rooney Rule, which he calls the Eddie Robinson Rule in honor of the legendary Black football coach from Grambling State.


   


  That rule would require two candidates of color be interviewed for each position at the senior levels of athletic department administration, as well as mandatory representation across genders in the hiring process.


   


  "I think the thing that is going to make the difference now as opposed to everything that's happened before and gives me hope is the voices of athletes are being raised," Lapchick said. "I think that's going to be an irresistible force on some college campuses to bring about the changes that are being asked for.


   


  "… We have a moment in time where we can really bring about change here. If we miss this opportunity, it might not come along again for a long time."

PENN YAN -- Congressman Paul Tonko (D-NY20) is endorsing his fellow Democratic colleague Tracy Mitrano in her bid to unseat the Republican incumbent in New York's 23rd congressional district. Tonko's district includes all of Albany and Schenectady counties and parts of Montgomery, Rensselaer and Saratoga counties. He is serving his sixth term in Congress.


   


  "Tracy has the energy, commitment and passion for public service that is required for the job. She doesn't hesitate to roll up her sleeves to find common sense solutions to the challenges in her district. I endorsed Tracy in 2018 and I am proudly endorsing her again," Tonko said. "Her voice as a cybersecurity expert is sorely needed in Congress, and I couldn't be more proud to support her campaign."


   


  "I'm honored by Congressman Tonko's confidence in me," said Mitrano. "Working together as fellow upstaters, we could do a great deal of good for our region in Congress, from extending broadband Internet services to rural areas to preserving the natural beauty of our districts."


   


  Tonko chairs the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change and serves on the Science, Space and Technology Committee, as well as on the Natural Resources Committee. He is also the co-chair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, or SEEC. Since Democrats took the majority in the House of Representatives in 2018, he has worked as a primary architect of Congressional climate change legislation to protect clean air, water and soil, and to create new clean energy jobs.


   


  Tonko is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the oldest standing committee in the House. He's the first upstate New York Democrat to serve on that committee since 1966.


   


  Mitrano faces Rep. Tom Reed, R-Corning, in November's general election, a rematch of the 2018 election.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats have unveiled a plan to address climate change that would set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It also would push renewable energy such as wind and solar power and address environmental injustice that harms low-income and minority communities. The election-year plan backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders is less ambitious than a sweeping Green New Deal that a group of progressive Democrats outlined last year. The new plan sets a range of targets, including a 45% reduction by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions. It would require that new cars by 2035 would emit no greenhouse gases, while heavy-duty trucks would eliminate those emissions by 2040.

SEATTLE -- Seattle Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto had at one point expected former first-round pick Logan Gilbert to be pitching at T-Mobile Park by the time June rolled around.  
 He also believed Jarred Kelenic, one of the top prospects in all of baseball, would likely soon follow him to the big leagues, set to join a group of prospects expected to be at the core of the Mariners' rebuilding project.  
 "Eventually, our players are still going to hit the ground running and achieve whatever ceiling they were able to achieve," Dipoto said. "It may just take a little bit longer."  
 From Seattle to Kansas City, Baltimore to Miami, rebuilding teams that were hoping to see their young prospects play in the majors this season are reevaluating their plans.  
 The challenge: figure out how to get a substantive season in for some of the top talent in the minor leagues that these clubs are banking on to eventually become contributors if they ever want to climb out of division basements. And do it amid the coronavirus pandemic, which is likely to knock out all minor league play this year.  
 Is it worth starting the clock on the career of a top prospect for a truncated 60-game season? What about the taxi squad each team will keep? Is there enough of an opportunity for meaningful at-bats or innings to pitch? Could there be an expanded fall league option in Arizona, presuming health and safety concerns allow for that?  
 All key questions. None with straightforward answers.  
 "It is affecting all 30 clubs," White Sox GM Rick Hahn said. "And it is something that as we head into the fall, winter, the 2021 season we're going to have to adjust our expectations in terms of guys' pacing, in terms of guys' likelihood and timing at making an impact at the next level."  
 The list of teams facing a significant rebuild is short. Seattle is there. So, too, are the Royals, Orioles and Tigers in the American League. In the National League, it's more muddled outside of the Marlins, with a mix of teams good enough to stay in the race for 60 games but also looking ahead to the future.  
 The Marlins thought top prospect Sixto Sanchez might pitch in the majors this year. Now, is it worth it? Same for their top draft pick, Max Meyer out of Minnesota.  
 Will the Royals bring up Bobby Witt Jr.? What about Adley Rutschman in Baltimore or Kelenic in Seattle?  
 "You want to be 100% sure a player is ready to help you at the major league level before you add them. ... There's no minor leagues to send them down to if they struggle at the major league level," Royals GM Dayton Moore said. "So it's a unique situation, a unique challenge that we're looking forward to, but we also have to think big picture as well."  
 The teams caught in the middle are those who expected 2020 to be a springboard. They may have had key players who had a taste of the big leagues in 2019 and were hoping this season would be the transition into becoming contenders in 2021.  
 A prime example is Hahn and the White Sox.  
 "I'm of the mindset, and have been of the mindset, is what we're building here is a multiyear project. It's a multiyear endeavor," Hahn said. "This was going to be sort of that first year of transitioning from the rebuild into that competitive stage, so it's extremely important from our perspective to get these guys out there and competing."  
 "We obviously have a young club, a team that's only going to grow and benefit from playing experience during the regular season and hopefully the postseason, so getting a taste of that this season was of the utmost importance," he said.  
 For the White Sox and others on the fringe of contention, it could mean taking a different approach to a 60-man group that includes the taxi squad. As in, would it be better to have players with big league experience available immediately if need be, or prepare prospects for the future?  
 In Seattle's case, Dipoto said he's now viewing the development of their prospects in a 17-month window. Whether it's on the taxi squad or in some sort of fall league, what can they get accomplished this year? And how does that alter the time frame for where they should be in their development come 2021?  
 For a club that expected to start turning the corner next year, the developmental loss this season could be significant.  
 "We are viewing this as almost the beginning of an onboarding for the next 17 months and messaging it to the players like that," Dipoto said. "We have your best interests in mind. We are going to preserve your health and well-being above all other things, and along the way we're going to compete our butts off and try to win as many of these 60 games as we can win.  
 "And who knows what can happen in a season like that, when it's 60 games. Anybody can get hot and make a run. And I guess to that extent we have as good a shot as anybody, but we're also highly focused on the big picture and it will stay that way."

Born and bred in World War II, over six million M1-, M1A1-, M2- and M3-carbines were made in total from 1942 to 1945. It was the most widely produced American military arm of the era, even surpassing M1 rifle production by at least half a million and not one was made in a U.S. Army Ordnance Department arsenal. Ten private factories produced the majority of them (mostly semi-auto M1s) in a fury of wartime production. Serious carbine collectors usually won’t rest until they have at least one example from each firm.

 “We are here today to provide hope and vision,'' said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., chairwoman of the climate panel. She called the Democratic plan a "transformative road map for solving the climate crisis,'' and pledged that it would address environmental justice and vulnerable communities that are suffering from the effects of air and water pollution and industrial waste.
 "The health of our families and the air we breathe are at the heart of our plan,'' Castor said, adding that the plan would create good-paying jobs in solar and wind energy, manufacturing electric vehicles and ensuring that communities are more resilient to flooding, extreme heat, intense hurricanes and wildfires.

Since the notion of arming support troops with carbines was already a couple hundred years old when the M1 Carbine came on the scene, why was the M1 series such a standout among its military peers? First off, at a time when most military carbines were just shorter-barreled versions of full-power military bolt-action rifles, the M1 Carbine was semi-automatic and chambered in mild mannered .30 Carbine (ballistically similar to the .357 Magnum pistol cartridge). If you’ve ever fired a 7.62 x 54R through a 20″ barreled Russian M44 Mosin Nagant carbine, you’ll understand how punishing similar carbines are to shoot in terms of recoil and muzzle blast. The mild recoiling M1 Carbine is a delight to shoot and no small part of the gun’s popularity.

According to the sheriff's office, Foster was operating the watercraft on a private pond at 3550 County Road 4 and had an 8-year-old boy on board when a crash happened. Neither Foster nor the boy were wearing personal floatation devices that are required for minors.


  Foster will appear in Hopewell Town Court to answer the charge.


  Chris Barber, 40, of Bloomfield, a bystander, dove into the water to help the child but had some sort of medical event and began drowning. Sheriff Kevin Henderson said after the accident. Deputies got him out of the water and performed CPR, but he was pronounced dead at Thompson Hospital.

RAY BROOK — Out with the young, in with the old.
 The state-run Adirondack prison in Ray Brook has again been converted, this time from a facility for teenage boys to a medium-security prison for men over 55.
 In 2018, the then-medium-security adult facility was converted to hold male inmates between the ages of 16 and 18. This was done in light of Raise the Age laws, which raised the age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18 for nonviolent offenders in New York.
 This year’s state budget transferred the responsibility for these young offenders from the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision to the state Office of Children and Family Services. Gov. Andrew Cuomo first proposed the idea in late January in his Executive Budget.

These are the kinds of things Tulsa County Election Board Secretary Gwen Freeman has been dealing with since the polls, most of them, anyway, opened at 7 a.m.
 “When you have 700-something or 800 people out in the field, there is always going to be something with one or more of your precinct officials, or the precinct locations,” Freeman said. “So there are always the early-morning issues that plague you at first no matter the size of the election.”
 Freeman said precinct workers have been given the option to wear masks and goggles, or both, but that many have chosen to wear protective shields.
 “They started going to the shield because people could hear them better and they felt like they could breathe better,” she said.
 Voters are not required to wear masks at polling stations. However, that message didn’t make it to everyone Tuesday.
 Among the minor headaches Freeman dealt with was a church worker who was instructing people entering the building to vote that they had to wear a mask.
 “We are not going to stop you from voting because you don’t wear a mask,” Freeman said. “We called the church, and sure enough, the pastor fixed it real quick.”
 Many Tulsa County voters are headed to new polling stations Tuesday. The Election Bureau had to find dozens of new sites because some facilities, such as nursing homes, aren’t available during the pandemic.

Licensing Reform


  Iowa is one of the most heavily licensed states in the country. Nearly one out of every three workers in Iowa is required to maintain a license to work in their profession, while the national average is one out of every four workers.


  Licensing in many areas of the economy has a proper role. It ensures consumers can depend on reliable and professional service and it protects them from scammers and grifters. However, excessive licensing is a significant burden for low income Iowans trying to work their way out of poverty. It creates hurdles for job creators in their effort to expand their business and meet the demands of their customers.


  HF 2627 starts to ease those burdens by waiving first-time licensing application fees for low income individuals. For many licenses, it credits work performed in other states without licensure to meet Iowa’s license requirements, establishes universal licensing path that recognizes licenses from other states, and improves the licensing process for felons who have completed their sentence. A uniform conviction standard, focused on offenses directly related to professions, will help some felons earn a living and reduce their likelihood of recidivism.


  Licensing reform is one of several pro-growth bills passed in the short conclusion of the 2020 legislative session to rebuild the Iowa economy. The economy was the best in the history of the state prior to the arrival of the coronavirus in Iowa. Policies like HF 2627 will play a key role in rebuilding our economy.


  Finally, I would like to mention one of budget items appropriated though the appropriations budget subcommittee I chair, known as Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund (RIIF). In light of the current times and challenges we are having as a society, I find it important to note funding I have supported for law enforcement. Through RIIF we have appropriated near $20 million to the remodel and repair of the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA), furnishings and classroom technology for ILEA, a new state patrol aircraft outfitted with technology to aid in tracking human trafficking activity, protective equipment for troopers and bomb disposal units, and finally an upgrade to communication technology across the state. Iowa is very fortunate to have the well trained, loyal, and dedicated public safety employees we have working for us.


  Thank you for all your calls, emails, and messages throughout the legislative session. I am glad to be back home.

New leadership is coming to the Waseca Public School District.
 Eric Hudspith is taking over as the new superintendent starting on July 1. He will be taking over for retiring Tom Lee, who has been with the district for seven years.
 “I really had a pretty smooth transition,” Hudspith said. “Tom (Lee) has been very gracious, allowing me to meet with the board members, all the administrators and talk about what's currently going on in the district.”
 Coming to the school district Hudspith has been able to meet with administration, staff, faculty and some students to learn about the community.
 “I think that it's really important as the superintendent to be professionally a part of the community, but also just to be personally a part of the community,” Hudspith said. “And so that is something I intend to do is to become personally a part and my family as well to become personally a part of the community as well as professionally.”
 Part of his transition plan that the school board looked at when he was hired involved Hudspith making community connections in July and August.
 "Eric is going to do a great job in Waseca," Lee said. "He has taught two different grades, been a principal and has held a few different district level jobs. He is known to be a great person to work with. He and I have met several times to assure a smooth transition. He is ready."
 Hudspith is coming from the Mankato School District where he was the director of human resources and organizational development. Through this position he has worked closely with the superintendent where he was able to gain experience and knowledge. Prior to working in Mankato he was in the Albert Lea school district for 10 years.
 From his past experiences and his knowledge of Waseca, Hudspith has set a few personal goals that he plans to strive for long-term in his position at Waseca schools.
 “Well, I'm still learning a little bit, but I'm looking forward to continuing to make sure that the district is a leader in the community and I think they already are in a lot of ways,” Hudspith said. “The only thing that I have learned about the community of Waseca so far is that the community is really supportive of the schools and also has really high expectations of its schools. I embrace that.”
 One goal he spoke of is continuing to make sure that every student that leaves the school district has options for what they want to do in life.
 Some ways Hudspith said this could be done is through what has been learned from distance learning to offer more opportunities for students through online courses that they didn’t have access to in the past. Part of this for Hudspith is he cares about providing the environment for students to grow and succeed at whatever path they choose.
 Waseca is already embracing what students want to gain out of their education through personalized learning and Hudspith plans to continue developing this practice in the schools.
 “If I had to say what’s my goal, it's going to be the best district in Minnesota,” Hudspith said.
 Something that Hudspith will have to tackle immediately is how to handle COVID-19 and how to plan for the beginning of the school year.
 “I think it's (starting during COVID-19 preparations) allowed me to get to know the teaching and the operations of our district faster or more efficiently than maybe I would in some years,” Hudspith said. “So as we’re developing our plan for the fall, developing our three plans that our committees are working on now, Superintendent Lee has brought me in on that and so I'm up to speed on that planning for the fall, more so than I would probably be in many transitions.”
 Hudspith has been able to collaborate and work with the school board, administrators and other staff to create the three plans required for the beginning of the school year. One thing that Hudspith said about all of the schools that he has worked with in his career is the importance of meeting all the needs of all learners especially during distance learning and the holes in it and how to fix that for students.
 “It also helps me build immediate trust with my team,” Hudspith said. “Because right now I have to trust that my team knows what they're doing and I have complete faith that they do and we have smart people who are doing great work. So this is my opportunity to get to know them better by them showing their stuff and expertise right away.”
 His work in Waseca has already started through the plans for COVID-19 and meeting his team and the community members.
 “I've got the good fortune to look where I wanted my next career adventure,” Hudspith said. “I wanted to be here because of the high level of academic achievements and high level of activities they have. ...
 “One of the observations that I have about Waseca is that this is a high functioning district that really serves its community well and so that is one of the things that attracted me to this district.”
 Hudspith spoke highly of his impressions of the Waseca Public School District.
 “This is an incredible district that’s really doing a lot of great things for kids and families and for staff,” Hudspith said. “So I chose to be a part of this district for that reason and I always really had a high respect for Waseca and its schools.”
 Waseca is only Hudspith's third district in his years of teaching, administration and district employment.
 ”I’ve got a pretty wide range of experience in education, but only in two different school districts because I like to stick around,” Hudspith said. “I want to invest in where I am. That was another thing that I liked about Waseca is it was very clear to me that the school board was interested in someone who was going to invest in the community and that's what I want to do is invest.
 “In my opinion, one of the things that drives me or that I appreciate is being able to see some of the things through that you implement so that when you get to the challenging part of it or it gets hard you're there to work your folks through it or you can celebrate with people when things go really well. So I don't intend to start something and then go. It's just not my personality and it's more of an investment in the long run.”
 Hudspith got into education because of his family background in education.
 Both his maternal and paternal grandparents worked for schools and were role models for him growing up. Having this background led him to get a bachelor's degree in elementary education from the University of Minnesota, Duluth.
 He continued his education at Minnesota State University, Mankato where he obtained his master's degree in education technology before getting his specialist degree in K-12 administration at the University of St. Thomas. Hudspith furthered his education again and got his superintendent licensure at the University of St. Thomas as well.
 “I had some great role models in that regard from family but I always knew that I wanted to help kids,” Hudspith said. “I always knew I wanted to support kids. And again this is a little bit cliche but it’s about my career trajectory.
 “When I was in the classroom I loved impacting those 30 kids. Then I got the opportunity to be a building principal where I could impact 500 kids. Then I got to the district level where I am now I am helping support one part of the whole district staff, human resources and now to move to a superintendency where my skills and experiences and personality can support the entire district and community. So it kind of goes from the classroom level that you support to now I can support the entire community. My goal or part of what drives me every day is using my skills and talents to support the entire community.”

“I really don’t know how they went about deciding who went,” Gerber said Monday afternoon. “I was still in big league camp when that whole thing ended in March, so technically I guess I wasn’t cut yet. Our farm director called me and said I would be coming back out to Seattle. I was really excited about that, and I’m really excited about the opportunity.”


  Gerber also understands that opportunity comes with plenty of questions he doesn’t really have answers for right now with sports resuming still in the midst of a pandemic. Mostly about his health. He’s healthy now. Staying that way, though, is his concern.


  “I think most of us are going to be able to stay healthy in terms of being able tor recover from the virus,” Gerber said. “As far as making sure nobody gets the virus, that’s going to be a challenge, honestly. I don’t know how that’s going to work out. At some point, somebody’s going to get it.


  “Even if you completely isolate, there’s always going to be some weak link where it’s possible for something to happen. I’m just hoping things work out and the protocols are enough. Are they going to be enough? I honestly don’t know. I don’t know if anybody really knows. It’s a trial and error thing. You’ve got to do it to find out.”


  All Gerber can be confident is Seattle’s training camp will begin this week. Everything else that follows is still to be determined for the 23-year-old native of Maple Grove, Minn.


  “We’re going to get things going,” he said. “If there’s a gigantic spike or there’s a huge outbreak again across the entire country, I’m sure baseball will reflect that and it’s tough to get a season on board. If things kind of stay where they are now, I think we’re going to be able to get things going. But I’m not an expert on that. I really don’t know.”

“We advised (the county clerk’s office) that he should accept the candidate slated by the party,” Champaign County State’s Attorney Julia Rietz said. “If anybody wants to challenge that, they need to challenge that in court.”


  The party faction headed by state Rep. Ammons last week rejected the incumbent treasurer appointee, Marisol Hughes, and slated Democrat Cassandra Johnson to run for the post in the November election.


  That was followed by the party faction headed by Ar-Raheem — Ammons’ rival for the position of party chairwoman — slating Hughes as its Democratic treasurer candidate.


  The position is up for election in November because former treasurer Laurel Prussing, who was elected to a four-year term in 2018, was overwhelmed by the duties of the office. She resigned at the end of January 2020, leaving the office in highly publicized shambles.


  Because of the timing of Prussing’s resignation, state law requires voters to fill the two-year balance of Prussing’s term by election in November.


  The office will be up for election to a four-year term again in 2022.


  Champaign County Republicans have yet to choose their candidate. They have until Aug. 26 to make their choice, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.


  Circumstances of the dual Democratic slating, however, remain uncertain because, even though the county clerk’s office Monday rejected Hughes’ filing papers, litigation remains a viable option.


  County Clerk Aaron Ammons is married to Rep. Ammons. In that respect, his office’s decision to reject the filing papers of a candidate opposed by his wife has appearance problems. But his office defended its decision as above- board, and Rietz’s legal blessing closes the matter for the time being.


  “The nomination for vacancy was already filled by the recognized chair of the Democratic party, chairwoman Ammons. Chairwoman Ammons submitted the paperwork on Thursday (6/25) at 8 a.m. to nominate Cassandra ‘CJ’ Johnson as the Democratic Treasurer in the November 2020 general election,” said Deputy Clerk Angie Patton, a former campaign aide to both Aaron and Carol Ammons.


  Although Patton characterized Ammons as the “recognized chairman” of the county Democratic Party, that description is in dispute.


  Ammons’ supporters claim they ousted Ar-Raheem from the chairwoman’s post on April 15, electing Ammons to take her place.

Trump Campaign Sues 67 Pa. County Election Boards, Including Allegheny County Election Board, Over Mail-In Ballots
   *[FT]: Financial Times

Typically there are 262 polling stations countywide; Tuesday’s election will have approximately 240.
 At the Mabee Center on the campus of Oral Roberts University, 77-year-old Robert Buchanan came ready. He entered and exited the polling station wearing a mask and white rubber gloves.
 “There is nobody in there, just the poll watchers,” Buchanan said.
 More than 30,000 Tulsa County residents have requested absentee ballots — far exceeding any previous election — which Buchanan said might have accounted for the lack of a crowd inside the polling station when he arrived at about 8:15 a.m.
 “We purposely waited until after the people who vote before they go to work,” Buchanan said.
 Chiquita Ponds, 56, noticed some differences at Rudisill Regional Library, her longtime polling place.
 “When I went in, I had to go in a different way,” she said. “I was a little confused initially, but I recognized the people that I normally see. But the process was smooth, easy. ...
 “People had face masks on, those face shields, which made me feel a lot safer.”
 The Election Board was set to meet again Tuesday morning to process another 1,700 absentee ballots.
 So far, the board has received back approximately 21,000 of the more than 30,000 absentee ballots it sent out.
 The final batch will be picked up at the Post Office just before the polls close at 7 p.m.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats have unveiled a plan to address climate change that would set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, while pushing renewable energy such as wind and solar power and addressing environmental injustice that harms low-income and minority communities.
 The plan, put forth Tuesday in a 538-page report, sets a range of targets, including a 45% reduction by 2030 of the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. The plan also would require that new cars sold by 2035 emit no greenhouse gases, while heavy-duty trucks would eliminate those emissions by 2040. The plan would eliminate overall emissions from the power sector by 2040 and all but eliminate greenhouse emissions from all economic sectors by 2050.
 The plan backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders is less ambitious than a sweeping Green New Deal that a group of progressive Democrats outlined last year to transform the U.S. economy to combat climate change and create thousands of jobs in renewable energy. The Green New Deal, championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., calls for dramatic steps to virtually eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and sets a goal to meet “100% of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources,” including nuclear power.

During the series all eyes would be on Rohit, who had scored three hundreds including a double century against South Africa at home in his debut series as Test opener last October. He, however, missed two games in New Zealand due to a calf injury.
 "It's going to test any batsman in the world, but I think because he's (Rohit) played a lot of One-Day cricket batting at the top of the order, and now he's been having some success with the red ball game as well, that'll give him confidence coming in," Hussey said.
 "I have no doubt in my mind that he's got the ability and the skill and the temperament, to be able to handle it."
 The former Australia left-handed batsman said the key for Rohit would be adaptability to the Australian conditions.
 "I think he would adapt. No, worries at all of his batting at the top of the order. It will be challenging in Australian conditions against the top quality bowling attack with pace and bounce," Hussey said.
 The 45-year-old left-handed batsman feels return of the duo of Steve Smith and David Warner will make life difficult for the Indians in the upcoming series.
 Smith and Warner missed India's historic away Test series win over Australia in 2018 because of their one-year bans for their involvement in the infamous ball-tampering episode in South Africa.
 In the absence of the duo, India recorded their first Test series win Down Under in 2018-19.
 "Obviously, bringing back Smith and Warner into the team is huge, but the guys that were exposed and perhaps probably weren't quite ready at the time from two years ago, have now managed to get a number of Test matches under their belt... India are going to be up for a stiff challenge in Australia this summer," Hussey said in a chat show on Sony Ten's Pit Stop.
 "Put that with a world class bowling attack in Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazelwood and (James) Pattinson as well with Nathan Lyon...I think the team looks extremely strong, they are playing some excellent Test cricket. We know India are a world class team, but they have to be at their best to beat the Australian team on home soil." Hussey feels the absence of the two key batsmen, Smith and Warner, exposed the young Australians to the rigours of Test cricket.
 "They basically had to either sink or swim and someone like (Travis) Head I think has really shown a lot of character, a lot of guts and a lot of fight in grabbing hold of his opportunity and he's performed pretty well," he said.
 Post the sandpaper gate scandal, Hussey feels the Australian team has worked extremely hard to gain their respect back.
 "The team copped up a lot of stick, lost a lot of respect in the cricket community here in Australia and all around the world. They've worked extremely hard over the last couple of years to gain the respect back from the cricket community, by the way they play and the way they conduct themselves and I think Tim Paine's led that really well," he said.
 The Chennai Super Kings-player-turned-batting consultant further hailed 'Captain Cool' MS Dhoni, saying he should be allowed to take a call on his career.
 "He's been an incredible person and player for CSK for so long, and India for that matter, and we hope he keeps playing for another 10 years but I'm not sure we're going to be able to see that so hopefully he can play for as long as he can."
 Post India's World Cup semifinal exit in 2019, Dhoni has been on a sabbatical with speculation surrounding his career.
 Hussey also admired the way Virat Kohli respects the presence of Dhoni in the team and the chemistry the duo shares.

 "I think you got to give a lot of kudos to Virat Kohli, having someone like MS Dhoni still in the team who's been, arguably, India's most successful captain. Sometimes some people would find that threatening to still have that person in the team," he said.
 "But I think that's where you need to tip your hat to Virat and so you know he's obviously got the personality to say 'no, no I would like this guy around. I can learn from this guy, and he's going to help me get down the better skipper and obviously have a better team'," he signed off.

Taylor told Forgey that he had grown up at boot camp and had become the man he should've been when he walked into WMC with a semi-automatic handgun. He said he made a "terrible, terrible decision" that morning and that he planned to leave Wyoming and never come back.
 Natrona County District Attorney Dan Itzen, who tried the case last summer, said the recommendation was a "close call" for his office. Itzen asked that some more stringent limitations be put in place to "step down" Taylor from the regimented life at the boot camp program to "near freedom" of probation in Nevada.
 Forgey said he was "pleased" with the results of the boot camp program and found sufficient reason to release Taylor to probation. He demurred on the subject of whether Taylor could serve out that sentence in Nevada, leaving the decision up to the state Department of Corrections. He prohibited Taylor from taking drugs or consuming alcohol during his probationary period.

Given what he achieved despite lack of playing time in Norway, it seemed as if there was more in store for Sandhu. But for the Chandigarh Football Academy product, it wasn’t meant to be. He had no choice but to leave Europe as he fell down the pecking order once Billy McKinglay replaced Bob Bradley as head coach in 2016.            That paved the way for his return to India, as the keeper joined Bengaluru in 2017 after three seasons with Stabaek. Sandhu has since gone on to establish himself as the first-choice goalkeeper for club Bengaluru FC and country.             “I didn’t want to leave [Stabaek] but it’s something that had to happen,” he recently said in an interview on the Indian Super League’s Instagram handle.             “I didn’t want to continue, I wasn’t getting game time under the new coach after Bradley left. When you know that coach doesn’t want to give you a chance and wants to go with an experienced guy, I knew this wasn’t the place for me. My first intention was to stay in Europe and I tried my best. There were one or two options but they were under the level which I was already at. So I didn’t want that. I would rather go back to India and be there,” Sandhu added.            His European stint may have not gone to plan but he entered uncharted territory by becoming the first Indian to feature in a Uefa competition – a proud achievement not only for him but also for Indian football.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

The People's Republic of China's "human rights record is deplorable, and its efforts to disguise that record must be countered with more transparency, more discussion, and more truth, as the UN's founders envisioned," she said adding that the Trump administration will "continue to lead those efforts, and will take every opportunity to give voice to those in Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, and elsewhere who are prevented from using theirs." Craft said the experts revealed the true state of human rights in China and their statement outlined the Chinese Communist Party's "systematic repression of religious and ethnic minorities, the disappearance and detention of lawyers and human rights defenders, and the regime's use of forced labour." Craft urged all her counterparts at the United Nations and in international organisations around the world to take note of the statement. The UN human rights independent experts had said that it is time for "renewed attention" on the human rights situation in China, particularly in light of the moves against the people of the Hong Kong SAR, minorities of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the Tibet Autonomous Region, and human rights defenders across the country.                     *[FT]: Financial Times
