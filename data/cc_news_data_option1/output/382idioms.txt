 Lakes and ponds are a pretty sight in any season, but freezing temperatures in the winter turn them into a magical-looking natural wonderland. Lake Nazik in Bitlis province's Ahlat district in eastern Turkey is no exception. As the temperature dropped below minus 20 degrees Celsius at night, the body of water slowly solidified into ice, pushing fishing boats and rowboats to the surface. Shaped by the sun, wind and snow, superficial cracks fractured the lake's surface, leaving whimsical patterns. Drones managed to capture photographs of the beautiful sight from above. Kids made the frozen lake their playground, punctuating the natural serenity with their squeals of delight as they slid and skidded across the glassy surface. Spanning an area of 40 square kilometers, the lake, between the town of Ovakışla and villages of Nazik, Gölgören, Dilburnu and Kırıkkaya in Ahlat, stays frozen for three months out of the year. Ahmet Canbay, a resident of Dilburnu village, said the lake started to freeze in mid-January, and soon locals would go ice-fishing in the lake. 'This year the lake froze a little later than usual. The ice has reached about 15-20 centimeters thickness. When the ice is at least half a meter thick, we break the ice and go fishing in the lake. Our animals also get to drink from the freshwater (after we open up holes),' he said. Nametullah Özcanoğulları, a local boy, said he loved to traipse around with his friends on the lake and play ball games on it. 'It is a beautiful place. The frozen surface has become our football field. It will be more beautiful when it gets covered in snow,' he said.

 The Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday commemorated the victims of the Elazığ earthquake, which claimed 41 lives, with solidarity messages that were displayed on digital boards near the court during their match against the New Orleans Pelicans. The LED boards showed messages in Turkish that read 'Our prayers are with you Elazığ,' while displays on the posts read 'Malatya,' referring to Elazığ's neighboring Malatya province, where casualties and heavy damages also occurred. Speaking after the match, Cavalier's Turkish forward Cedi Osman thanked his team for the emotional support. 'I sincerely thank the Cleveland Cavaliers Organization who raised awareness by showing support messages on boards and posts. I am proud to be a part of this family,' he said. The NBA player previously pledged to donate $100 to quake victims for every 3-pointer made during Saturday's NBA game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Chicago Bulls. He ended up donating $10,000 with his teammate Larry Nance despite 25 3-pointers. On Friday, Elazığ was struck by a magnitude 6.8 earthquake that killed 41 and injured 1,607 others. The quake also displaced thousands in the eastern province and neighboring Malatya as dozens of buildings collapsed.

POLICE SHOOTING-SCOTTSDALE HOSPITALScottsdale police say man dies after being shot by officerSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Authorities say a man has died after being shot by Scottsdale police outside a hospital. The Scottsdale Police Department says an officer shot the man Tuesday as he approached authorities with a knife in his hand. The suspect was taken into the hospital and later pronounced dead. Authorities say police had been called to HonorHealth Scottsdale Osborn Medical Center about a man with a rifle just outside the public entrance to the ER. Hospital security had taken the rifle from him by the time police arrived. Police say no officers were injured and an investigation is ongoing. Authorities did not release the name of the man who died. The hospital didn't immediately respond to a request for commentMURDER CONVICTION OVERTURNEDMurder conviction overturned in Navajo reservation killingGALLUP, N.M. (AP) — A federal appeals court has overturned a Gallup man's first-degree murder conviction in a 2016 homicide, ruling that the defendant should have been allowed to present evidence that the man killed had used methamphetamine before a fatal fight. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Tuesday grants Brian Tony a new trial in the killing of 44-year-old Pat Garcia on the Navajo reservation near Church Rock. Tony claimed self defense and the trial judge allowed him to present evidence that Garcia's behavior was erratic and violent. However, the judge didn't allow Tony to indicate that Garcia's alleged behavior resulted from methamphetamine use. The appeals court said allowing the drug-use evidence sought by the defense might have explained Garcia's behavior.GRAND CANYON-SPECIAL PERMITSWedding plans at Grand Canyon? Park says seek permit soonerGRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) — If you want to tie the knot at the Grand Canyon, you'll want to get your request in sooner. The national park says a lack of staffing means applications for special use permits will take longer to process. Weddings, family reunions, memorial services and organized group hikes all require permits. Basic permits now take up to 30 days to process but will take up to 45 days starting Feb. 14. More complex requests could take up to 90 days. Commercial operations, such as road-based tours, also will be subject to the longer processing time into the summer.COAL-TRANSITION FUNDNavajo look to Arizona utilities to make up for coal lossesFLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — The Navajo Nation is looking to Arizona utilities that shared in the power generated on the reservation to help make up for the financial losses from the coal industry. Navajo leaders asked utility regulators in Arizona to require that power companies contribute financially and with technical assistance as the tribe focuses on renewable energy projects. The appeal was made in a rate case involving Tucson Electric Power, but it could extend to another major state utility and aid other communities that have long depended on revenue from coal.AP-US-CHILD DEATHS-PHOENIXWoman indicted on murder charges in deaths of her 3 kidsPHOENIX (AP) — A woman has been indicted on first-degree murder charges in the suffocation deaths of her three young children in Phoenix. The indictment filed Monday against Rachel Henry mirrors earlier charges lodged by prosecutors in the Jan. 21 deaths of 3-year-old Zane Henry, 23-month-old Miraya Henry and 7-month-old Catalaya Rios. Henry's attorney, Alan Tavassoli, didn't immediately return a call seeking comment late Tuesday afternoon. Henry is scheduled to be arraigned on Feb. 4. No motive for the killings has emerged.CHINA-OUTBREAK-ARIZONAArizona college students question response to virus casePHOENIX (AP) — Despite Arizona State University's attempts to tamp down panic, a confirmed case of a virus outbreak from China has left students feeling alarmed. From putting on masks to signing a petition to cancel classes, students are questioning whether the university and health officials are doing enough. The university said in a statement that its Tempe campus was open. Officials also reiterated the Arizona Department of Health Services' findings that the risk to the general public of contracting the coronavirus was low. The infected patient has ties to the ASU community but does not live in school housing. The person had traveled to Wuhan, China.FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT-SCHOOL CLOSINGArchitecture school started by Frank Lloyd Wright to closeSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The architecture school that architect Frank Lloyd Wright started nearly 90 years ago is closing. School officials announced Tuesday that the School of Architecture at Taliesin, which encompasses Wright properties in Wisconsin and Arizona, will shutter in June. The school's governing board said in a statement the “gut-wrenching decision” was made after no agreement could be made with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to keep operating the school. The school currently has 30 students. It will remain open for the spring semester. School officials say they are working on an agreement with Arizona State University's design school to allow those students' credits to transfer.EDUCATION TAXESTwo tax increase measures may be on November Arizona ballotPHOENIX (AP) — Arizona voters may have the opportunity to choose between competing tax increase measures to boost school funding in November. A proposal backed by some Republican lawmakers to boost a dedicated sales tax from 6/10 of a cent to a full penny is set for its first hearing Tuesday. If the full Senate and the House pass Sen. Kate Brophy McGee's referral it will appear on the ballot. Brophy-McGee said the proposal would boost yearly funding for schools, community colleges and universities by about $450 million. The second education funding proposal is a voter initiative backed by education advocates.

In the early 80s the brand became a victim of its own success, every city trader from Rio to New York and Frankfurt via London drove a 911, preferably the most in your face, fully optioned Turbo in black. But making money at everybody else’s expense became a dirty business. The owners’ reputations plummeted and took the aspirational qualities of Porsche down with them. Suddenly no car enthusiast would be seen even glancing at one. In London it got so bad that if you were in a 911 wanting to pull out of a side street you had to wait till everybody had gone home and the was road deserted. Nobody would let you out into the traffic, ever, no matter how much of a hurry you were in. Even if you smiled. Mind you, in London smiling at strangers in other cars is not wise, 911 or not.   Porsche had to work quite hard to distance themselves from that reputation. But with all that racing pedigree, it was a bit like Hugh Grant being caught in flagrante with a hooker. After some time, the quality, polish and charm wins out, all that is now forgiven and forgotten. Reputation restored and Porsche are once more one of the shiniest baubles on the automotive tree.
