 For this homeschooling mom, the biggest challenge is managing time between her older and younger child, who learn differently and have different requirements.
 “With an older child, you really have to give them the space to determine their own schedule, and there is a learning curve. Part of that is being available if they hit a bump in the road but not trying to control their navigating. So really, the biggest challenge is that balance between supporting their independence and growth while being available to help in constructive ways,” she said.

The latest zoo resident is the seventh baby for Tanda, who arrived – pregnant – at Zurich Zoo in December from an Israeli zoo, accompanied by two of her daughters and a young male. The gestation period lasted 487 days (16 months).
 The white rhinos of Zurich Zoo live in the large new Lewa Savannahexternal link, which they share with giraffes, zebras, antelopes and ostriches. The area was inaugurated in the absence of the public due to the coronavirus crisis.
 ## Closed enclosures
 Not everyone is happy about how zoos have been treated during the pandemic. Industry umbrella association Zooschweizexternal link said on Thursday it was “incomprehensible” that museums could re-open from May 11 but not zoos and animal parks. This was “unequal treatment” which was “unacceptable”, it said.
 Zoo visitors are mainly outside where the risk of infection is lower than in closed rooms in museums, it argued.

“Meu primeiro livro foi _Pedra_ e o último também vai ser”, disse o poeta ao companheiro de gulag, o campo de trabalhos forçados, com quem carregava tijolos só para se exercitar, aludindo ao título de seu livro de estreia. Seriam seus últimos dias antes de morrer e antes que Nadejda Mandelstam recebesse um bilhete para que fosse a um posto de correio para apanhar a devolução de um pacote que enviara ao marido: “Destinatário desaparecido” era o eufemismo para morto. Hoje, a história e seus brutos fatos são conhecidos. Pode-se ler o incontornável _Hope against Hope_ , de 1970, em que Nadejda recupera o calvário de Mandelstam (e dela). Hoje, os versos do poeta são patrimônio de uma humanidade ferida, a que se tem acesso graças à entrega de Nadejda a essa guerra única. Como disse o poeta irlandês Seamus Heaney, ao sussurrar e memorizar a obra do marido, que não poderia correr o risco de ser encontrada em papel, para que os verdugos stalinistas não a destruíssem, Na­dej­da tornara-se uma “guerrilheira da imaginação, devota à causa da poesia”. Hoje, com o nada menos que brilhante _O que Ela Sussurra_ , Noemi Jaffe opera o milagre vital da literatura — paralisa o tempo, como Nadejda o paralisara com as palavras sussurradas do marido, e liberta o trágico casal do rumoroso fluir do tempo. Inscreve-os, assim, sob a forma de uma esperança — como a do nome Nadejda — em papel firme como pedra.

 “The kids also love science projects. We have made moon dough, watched the reaction of shaving cream, water and food coloring and made a volcano.”
 Being outside as much as possible is essential, she adds, whether they are doing physical education activities like an obstacle course, a ninja warrior course, or chalk paintings. They have also raised and released butterflies from the caterpillar stage, went on a nature hunt and discovered how to tell the age of a tree by counting the rings on its stumps.
 “Another special activity we did was cut and colored hearts and wrote messages on them and then we taped them on signs around Olivette, including City Hall, parks, police station, and community center,” Minoff said.
 “My biggest challenge is getting my spirited child to do the work in the classes that he doesn't like. Another big challenge is playing referee between my children when some are finished with their work while others are not. I take that back...my _biggest_ challenge is juggling all the Zoom meetings that my children have to attend.”
 The best part, she said: “Spending time with my children and seeing how they learn. As difficult as this is and as much as we did not necessarily sign up for this challenge, we are really fortunate to be able to watch the world through our children's eyes. To see them learn and grow and how they interact with their teachers is amazing. I also love how creative my kids can be and how they work together on projects.”

Although the lockdown is centrally focused on containing the spread of infection and protecting the NHS’s capacity to cope, it is clear that such a radical and widespread change to society will have significant negative effects on people’s lives. We asked respondents to indicate whether they had experienced a significant problem or dispute in relation to key aspects of life. Our findings suggest that problems with mental health, loneliness and money are most prevalent. But of concern also is the 1% of respondents who reported problems of violence or abuse within the home, particularly in light of the earlier finding (above) that only 68% of respondents knew that it is permitted to move to another address because of a fear of violence at home.
