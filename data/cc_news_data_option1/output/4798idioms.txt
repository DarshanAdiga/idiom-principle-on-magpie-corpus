Gubernatorial races played out as expected, with all nine incumbents on the ballot winning. Montana’s Greg Gianforte (R) and Utah’s Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox (R) captured the two open seats. The five insurance commissioners’ races also favored incumbents and yielded only one new official, Montana’s Troy Downing (R). And Democratic efforts to make inroads on state legislatures did not come to pass. What do those results add up to?

Typically, when you think of Disney musicals, the phrase "Based on a true story" doesn't come to mind. But Kenny Ortega's directorial debut was loosely based on  the real New York City Newsboys' Strike of 1899, which aimed to force William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer to lower the prices of their newspapers to make them more affordable for the newsies to purchase. The strike was notable for being organised, mostly, by kids.

Still, making your own edibles is easier said than done. If you’ve ever tried making homemade cannabis-infused edibles from scratch, you probably already know it’s not always an easy process. There are so many factors to consider and steps to take - like decarboxylating your cannabis, infusing your oil and making sure the dosing is right for your dish. And if you don’t prepare everything in just the right way, you may find your edibles to be way less potent than you’d hoped.

AstraZeneca's third quarter revenue rose 3% to $6.6bn. That reflects good growth in new products, offset by a decline in some more mature drugs and a reduction in 'externalisation' or 'collaboration' revenues (where Astra sells a drug to a third party in return for an upfront payment and a small ongoing interest).

Carbon dioxide occurs in atmosphere naturally -- without it, the Earth would be too cold to sustain life. It cycles through the atmosphere into organisms and back, keeping the system in balance. The problem is that human activities -- mostly the burning of fossil fuels -- have added a lot more carbon dioxide into the system, far more than can be absorbed. And according to the WMO, the lockdown-induced drop in man-made emissions is smaller, or at most similar in size to natural fluctuations and so won't make any difference in the long term.

We would be remiss not to mention Astra's most recent roll of the dice - a tie up with Oxford University to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The vaccine looks promising, and has the added advantage of being storable at normal refrigerated temperatures, bear in mind though that AstraZeneca has promised to distribute the vaccine at no profit while the pandemic lasts. Still the project offers long run potential as well as helping develop an expertise in vaccines that it's lacked in the past.

Despite the significant progress in recent years and a drug portfolio that should be capable of delivering growth for years to come, Astra isn't yet back in peak condition. The group's still not generating enough cash to fund the dividend, and debt's climbing as a result. That's clearly unsustainable in the long run. Drugs have a limited time on patent after which sales typically collapse, and the current sales bonanza won't last forever. Astra needs to put its dividend on a more sustainable footing before that happens.

NEW YORK (AP) -- The National Retail Federation expects that holiday sales could actually exceed growth of prior seasons despite the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. The nation's largest retail trade group predicts that sales for the November and December period will increase between 3.6% and 5.2% over 2019 to a total between $755.3 billion and $766.7 billion. That excludes automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants. It compares with 4% growth to $729.1 billion last year. Holiday sales have averaged gains of 3.5% over the past five years. The NRF delayed the release of its forecast by about a month, citing the uncertainty around the pandemic. Still, it warns any further shutdowns of stores as virus cases surge would derail sales.

Burnley won for the first time in the Premier League this season as Chris Wood sealed a 1-0 victory against Crystal Palace, while Southampton missed a chance to go third in their 1-1 draw at Wolves on Monday.
 Burnley had failed to win any of their first seven games in the joint worst start to a season in the club's history.
 Sean Dyche's side were the only Premier League team yet to score a home goal this term until New Zealand striker Wood put them ahead in the first half against Palace.
 That was enough to clinch a much-needed three points for Burnley, who climbed out of the relegation zone at the expense of Fulham.
 "We created two or three golden chances, we take one and it gets a bit nervy because we hadn't found that first win. To get that one done will do us the world of good," Dyche said.
 "We have got a group that can challenge. We have had a tough start but that has been coming."
 Palace were missing Ivory Coast forward Wilfried Zaha after he tested positive for coronavirus and Roy Hodgson's side lacked a cutting edge without him as they slumped to a second defeat in three games.
 Burnley had managed just three league goals this season and hadn't scored since October 3 when Ashley Westwood netted in a loss at Newcastle.
 But Wood ended that four-game goalless run in the eighth minute when he fired home from Jay Rodriguez's flick after a poor headed clearance from Cheikhou Kouyate.
 Palace went close to equalising when Andros Townsend's curling effort forced a fine save from Nick Pope.
 Burnley were inches away from doubling their lead through Johann Gudmundsson, whose rising strike from the edge of the area cannoned off the bar.
 Michy Batshuayi should have equalised when he latched onto Dwight McNeil's wayward back-pass, but Pope was quickly off his line to block the Belgian's scuffed shot.
 Pope was in superb form and he came to Burnley's rescue again in stoppage time when he somehow clawed away Christian Benteke's close-range shot.
 \- Revitalised Walcott -
 At Molineux, Southampton were on course for a fourth successive win when Theo Walcott put them ahead in the second half.
 But Pedro Neto came off the bench to equalise as fifth-placed Southampton had to settle for extending their unbeaten run to seven matches.
 "I am happy. For everyone it was a tough game, tactically so demanding, it was like chess. They played 4-3-3, we didn't expect that but we found the answers," Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said.
 Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo added: "I think it was a foul for their goal. After that it was about reacting to that incident. The boys did that. We finished the game well, creating chances."
 Walcott has thrived in a central striker's role for Southampton since Danny Ings was injured and the converted winger tested Wolves keeper Rui Patricio in the first half with a snap shot.
 Southampton took the lead in the 58th minute, with a touch of controversy about the goal.
 Wolves were frustrated that Stuart Armstrong's barge into Rayan Ait-Nouri went unpunished in the build-up before Che Adams sent a low cross to the unmarked Walcott, who slotted home from close-range.
 It was the 31-year-old's first goal for Southampton since rejoining them on loan from Everton in October.
 His last league goal for Southampton came in his first spell there almost 15 years ago.
 Walcott should have netted again after Adams' pass put him clean through, but this time he side-footed wide from 12 yards.
 It was a crucial miss as Wolves equalised in the 75th minute as Raul Jimenez's fierce drive bounced back off the post to Neto and the substitute drove his first-time strike past Alex McCarthy.
 Neto nearly snatched a winner in the closing minute when his low drive was well saved by McCarthy.
