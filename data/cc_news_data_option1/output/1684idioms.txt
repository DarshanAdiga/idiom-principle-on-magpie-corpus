SRINAGAR, INDIA (AP) -- Ramadan in India, which began April 25 in the country, has been marred by the rising Islamophobia following accusations that a surge in infections was tied to a three-day meeting in March in New Delhi of an Islamic missionary group, the Tablighi Jamaat.

Port staff are working to install signage on both sides of the bridge to inform people of their options to pay online, and are continuing public outreach to clear up misunderstandings about BreezeBy and encourage as many people as possible to switch to that system.
 “A lot of the locals do have the misunderstanding that you need a bank account to get a BreezeBy,” said Scholl. “So we really are trying to reinforce to people that you don’t and if you want to top off your BreezeBy balance with cash … you can pop that cash in the drop box and let us know your license plate number and you’ll be fine.”
 While the port is urging bridge-users to move towards the BreezeBy system, Commissioner Kristi Chapman said that the point of this alternative all- electronic tolling method is to preserve the toll booth operators’ jobs for when the temporary PPE restrictions are lifted.
 “We did this intentionally to save our tollbooth workers,” said Chapman. “There were probably other options we could have looked at and gone forward with that would have essentially eliminated our toll booth people, but this is to protect our people in the long term to keep them as our greeters as they enter and exit our state.”
 Said Scholl, “Here’s a lot of concern, it’s actually really heartwarming how many people in the community are concerned that the toll takers are losing their jobs and that this would be a permanent thing.”

The original Pixel Buds were a strange product. They came out a full year after the AirPods, and despite having the same $250 price tag, they weren't very comfortable, they weren't very smart, and they weren't even truly wireless, as they still had a cable connecting the left and right buds. But for the new 2020...

Additionally, to make sure the Pixel Buds are both comfortable and secure, Google added a tiny stabiliser arm behind the ear tips, so getting a snug fit is as simple as sticking the buds in your ears and giving them a slight twist downwards to lock the buds into place. Meanwhile, on the outside, there are small touch-sensitive surfaces on both left and right buds that allow you to easily play or pause a song (single tap), skip forward one track (double tap), skip backwards one track (triple tap) and even adjust the volume (swipe forward to increase, swipe backwards to decrease) without ever needing to touch your phone or laptop. And of course, like every modern Google product, the Pixel Buds have full support for the Google Assistant so you can ask questions (touch and hold) and even get help with real-time translation just by asking.

So even though I’m not a teenager anymore, apparently my ears aren’t so screwed up. So I can still hear things like the Pixel Buds faint hiss or the high-pitched whine that older CRT and LCD monitors often time emit. However, this adds another challenge when deciding whether or not to buy the Pixel Buds, because while the issue could be very annoying for some, others might not be able to hear the hiss. Or you might just get lucky by getting a pristine pair of Pixel Buds that don’t produce any static at all. Either way, this isn’t something that almost any of the Pixel Buds’ competitors suffer from, regardless of if you go with less expensive rivals like the standard AirPods or Galaxy Buds+, or more premium options from Jabra and Sony.

But for the new 2020 Pixel Buds, Google has almost completely redeemed its previous efforts by creating something that’s a joy to use and listen to, that is if you can ignore or avoid the Pixel Buds’ one potential deal-breaker, a pernicious hiss.

“We’re pushing it to May 1,” said Chief Financial Officer Fred Kowell. “We’ll use every hour of the day until May 1.”
 The new system uses license plate recognition (LPR) software to track vehicles crossing the bridge.
 After seven days, the data is sent out to a third-party collector, either the Oregon DMV or Duncan Solutions, and an invoice is mailed to the address associated with the license plate informing the registered owner that they owe $5: The $2 bridge toll, plus a $3 administrative fee.
 Bridge-crossers will be able to pay the $2 toll online — with no administrative fee if they pay before the invoice is mailed out. Even after the invoice is sent, they can waive the fee if they pay the $2 toll and register for BreezeBy within 30 days.
 “One of the things we’re designing is the website and the ability to go in and make a payment,” said Kowell. “We’re trying to make it (the website) as idiot- proof as possible, but we’ve also looked at other tolling agencies to try and just pick a hodgepodge of the best attributes of each agency and what’s realistic for our time period, trying to design a system so we can go live May 1.”

"Part of the issue is just when you think you've adapted to this, something comes up," said Dr. Laura Hawryluck, a critical care physician at University Health Network and associate professor of critical care at the University of Toronto. "Like, for example, something really simple like you want to cook something and then you realize that you're missing an ingredient, and you realize what's going to be involved in getting that ingredient, if the stores even have it. Things that you've really taken for granted, that you wouldn't even think twice about and now every time that kind of moment comes up you re- experience the loss of life as it was all over again."

However, the Pixel Buds semi-open back design does come with some tradeoffs, with the main one being that if you’re in a noisy environment, you’re still going to clearly hear things like road noise, sirens, or the screeching wheels of a subway car. This can be an advantage if you prefer to not be totally isolated from the outside world, allowing you to still be aware of your surroundings if you’re riding your bike or simply walking around the city. The disadvantage of this is that if you’re on a plane, you are going to hear that crying baby. Sure, those cries might be slightly muffled, and you’ll still be able to pick a soundtrack of your choosing, but you won’t be able to escape its wails like you would if the Pixel Buds had active or even better passive noise cancelling.

Gov. Brown announced a “Framework for Opening Oregon,” but there are still details to work out with all the stakeholders, so any idea when we will get back to the new normal is anyone’s guess and probably wrong.
 For some of you, this has been a time to catch up and do things you haven’t thought about or had the time to do, like reread books you enjoyed 10 years ago, watch Bringing up Baby with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant — again — or learning to bake a pizza napoletana as they do in Naples, Italy, where pizza was born.
 Then for many of you, you have been inside long enough and about ready to go bananas! (Do people still use that expression — or am I showing my age?)

"A lot of people might be home with their abusers," says Thomas. "When you're not out in the community, when you're not out and about and having that contact with people it can be easy for people to fall into a mindset to think they're alone and that no one knows what's going on and is available to talk to them."
