Therefore, building a portfolio of diverse businesses could be a sound move. It may limit your risks to specific sectors that may find trading difficult after coronavirus has passed. It may also boost your returns in the long run, and allow you to partake in the FTSE 100's long-term recovery.

Medical professionals around this Muslim kingdom in North Africa spoke to The Associated Press, showing that the heartbreak and fears and the challenges of working safely are shared with Western counterparts, as is the devotion to saving lives.
 Two Moroccan doctors have died after becoming infected, officials have said. Morocco, which is under a strict lockdown, currently has more than 4,500 confirmed cases and some 170 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University count.
 Since early March, the Moroccan government has steadily introduced virus control measures that have gradually turned vibrant cities into near ghost towns. Health minister Khalid Ait Boutaleb says that if it weren’t for preventive measures, Morocco would now be facing 6,000 coronavirus-related deaths.
 Still, the virus has wrought personal havoc for some health workers, temporarily tearing them apart their families as they self-isolate at the end of the day to keep their loved ones safe.
 Radiology nurse Iman Benali at Casablanca’s Sidi Moumen Hospital has been away from her husband and 6-year-old child since early March. Some nurses working with Benali had to stop breastfeeding their infants when duty called, she said.
 Her long days end in self-isolation at a hotel with 70 other medical professionals. The hotel housekeepers are also forced to exchange families for hotel rooms because of their contact with the health professionals.
 Benali said the sacrifices shared with co-workers has created a special bond.
 “We watch out for each other out of compassion, but also out of fear for our own health,” she said. “If a hospital worker gets contaminated, it means the entire hospital workforce may be contaminated.”
 At Moulay Abdellah Hospital in Morocco's Atlantic coastal city of Sale, Dr. Youssef Dhabi said he believes the deaths of his colleagues are a driving force for caregivers.
 “If the deceased doctors were given a chance to return to work, they would take it instantly. You’d find them in their protective gear, treating patients," he said.
 During his 12-hour shift, nurse Ahyane rarely eats because he fears contamination. “You wonder, are your hands clean enough to eat?” he says.

That type of stuff, which I think is highly productive… It really gets squeezed when you're just dealing with adding another two-way guy or a roster spot or a 10-day guy or this guy has an injury and managing and mapping that out. And then you have another game coming. And Steve's focused on the game and not holistically, big picture, like we are. So this is a good time, and we're doing that. And it's been good. It's probably long overdue in some ways, and it's actually enjoyable. I love having those conversations. And I really am thankful and lucky to get to have them with Steve because he's, you know, got such great experience playing for [Gregg] Popovich, Phil Jackson, and being a GM. Now, having coached for six years, they're really thoughtful and provocative conversations every time we speak.

I have been not watching much. I’ve got three kids. I did watch Ozark… caught up on that one. I have designs to watch stuff. Clearly, I have watched the Last Dance – up to speed there. But I'm not a big old games guy. And also, like I said, my window of time to watch anything is really after the kids are down so it doesn't start till 8:30 or 9 p.m., and by that time, it's emails. If I do have a little bit of time — it sounds kind of boring, but I try to catch up on film of our potential draft picks. So I'm not on that Netflix trend. I aspire. I'm envious.

But it's a puzzle [that's] never solved, not the process of the draft, free agency, not coaching — you never say 'I'm done.' You never reach a point time you have figured it out. And even when you win a championship, because I'm fortunate enough to know what that feels like. I've never felt like the work is done. And that's what keeps pushing you though.

The timing of a FTSE 100 recovery is unclear due to the unpredictability of the news. But in the long run, the index is likely to revisit its all-time high of around 7,780 points. It has always recovered from its previous lows, and investors who have purchased shares during times of great uncertainty have often benefited from the index's subsequent recovery.

Belmont Abbey College expects to debut its first healthcare bachelor program this fall.
   
 Pending approval from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, Belmont Abbey expects to admit pre-nursing students, who will be on track to apply for the college's new nursing program their junior year, for the fall semester.
   
 Belmont Abbey estimates about 30 students will be admitted into the nursing program. Upon graduation, those students will receive a bachelor of science in nursing.
   
 Students who enroll in the program must maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA in all major courses, complete courses in one or two attempts and enroll in at least six credit hours of work in clinical practical settings.
   
 In development since 2018, a team of faculty and staff from the biology, business, theology, student life and academic affairs departments, as well as CaroMont Health, Gaston College, Gaston County Schools and Holy Angels, developed the new program.
   
 The BSN program will address the continuing healthcare needs in Gaston County and will thrive through collaboration with community partners.
   
 "To connect the history of our monks who sought to bring education to the south, to now bringing the very hands and feet of care to the people of our community is sublimely satisfying," wrote Belmont Abbey President Bill Thierfelder in a statement. "The relationship with CaroMont Health, Gaston College, and [Gaston County Schools], will bear fruit for many years to come."
   
 Belmont Abbey hired Dr. Carolyn Harmon, who will join the college on June 1 as nursing program director. Harmon comes to Belmont Abbey from Carolinas College of Health Sciences in Charlotte and the University of South Carolina with extensive experience in nursing course development.
   
 Novice nursing students will apply during the spring semester of their sophomore year and must pass a criminal background check and drug screening and submit immunization records. All students completing the four-year degree will have a clinical or professional practice placement during their senior year.

Personally, I wouldn't go to the highest-risk end of the stock market, as here the rebound could be slow. I would look for companies with strong balance sheets, continuing revenues, customers who are still spending, and manageable debt. There are plenty of cheap FTSE 100 stocks that fit the bill, without making too much of a gamble.

Take note that Infinity Ward mentioned last week that the matchmaking of Warzone will be tweaked to force suspected cheaters to play against each other in a sort of prison island. Hence, significantly reducing the number of cheaters in every match, at least in theory. That matchmaking change was supposed to go live this week. It may as well be already live but Infinity Ward has not provided any confirmation for the time being.
