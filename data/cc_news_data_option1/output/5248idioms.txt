Reminds me of when George Harrison was attacked in his home by a crazed fan. His wife Olivia beat the crap out of the attacker, including knocking him out cold with a table lamp.  Tom Petty sent George a get-well message, saying "Aren't you glad you married a Mexican girl?"

The new mom and husband Ben Domenech welcomed Liberty on Sept. 28, per _People_ __, and since then, she 's let followers in on what motherhood is like for her. "Motherhood is euphoria," she captioned _a photo of a gold necklace_ with a charm that reads "Mama" on Oct. 8. "All of the cliches have come true and exceeded well beyond my wildest expectations ~ it is hands down the best thing I have ever done in my entire life."
 She continued, "This is the first time since my Dad [ _Senator John McCain_] passed that the part of my heart that broke off and left with him no longer feels missing.... Thank you to all who have respected my protectiveness, boundaries and privacy during pregnancy and now first steps into motherhood. I know it is unorthodox given the public life I have chosen. It's all a work in progress and I will continue to share what I can as I (and Ben) are comfortable."
 About a week later, she shared _the first photo of the newborn_ (really, just the back of her head), her tightly swaddled, snuggled into Mom's shoulder. "Bliss. ‚ô•Ô∏èüóΩ," Meghan captioned the post.

There is an overwhelming sense of transition in the automotive community, and it can mainly be attributed to Tesla's ability to constantly reinvent the wheel. While many manufacturers are striving to start building electric powertrains on their own, many realize that Tesla has an overwhelming advantage in the sector. This comes from what Elon Musk commended the Tesla faithful for this morning: hard work, diligence, and a "never give up" attitude.

Mixed sentiment is once again the theme. On one hand, a stimulus package finally passed and a second coronavirus vaccine (Moderna) is on the way to ‚Äúsave the day.‚Äù On the other hand, COVID-19 is surging to record levels and a new strain discovered in the U.K. may be more contagious and infectious. As a result, stricter shutdowns are being implemented worldwide, including 27 countries which have banned flight to and from the U.K. Although last week ended mildly positive, and have largely kept the election and vaccine rally which started in November moving, there have been several indicators that show markets may be overheating, and that the economic recovery may be slowing down. Tesla‚Äôs official addition to the S&P 500 may cause a surge in volume and volatility as well. There may be a light at the end of the tunnel of this pandemic with the vaccines, and the second half of 2021 could be bullish for everyone. But for now, some more pain and some short-term jitters could spook investors. In this shortened trading week due to the Christmas holiday, it is anyone‚Äôs guess what could happen. Among all the news and data spurring on the markets, the deep learning algorithms at Q.ai have used Artificial Intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù) technology to rate the Top Trending Stocks for this week.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, says he deserves early release from home confinement but federal authorities refuse to credit him for good behavior and hundreds of hours of work and prison courses completed behind bars. Cohen filed court papers Monday contending he "could be eligible for release in a matter of weeks or months" under the First Step Act, a sweeping criminal justice reform Trump signed into law in 2018.

Tesla's overwhelming domination of the EV sector has been culminated through long hours of hard work by company employees who have had to roll with the punches through various hardships that have confronted the automaker. From the 2008 Roadster issues to the 2017 "production hell" Model 3, to the 2020 shutdown of its production plants amid the pandemic, Tesla has defied the odds on numerous occasions.

NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump‚Äôs former lawyer, says he deserves early release from home confinement but federal authorities refuse to credit him for good behavior and hundreds of hours of work and prison courses completed behind bars. Cohen filed court papers Monday contending he ‚Äúcould be eligible for release in a matter of weeks or months‚Äù under the First Step Act, a sweeping criminal justice reform Trump signed into law in 2018. Once one of Trump‚Äôs closest advisers, Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion, campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. His convictions included orchestrating payments to two women to keep them from talking publicly about alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen had been scheduled to remain in prison until next November, but was released in May to serve the remainder of his sentence at home as part of an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19 in federal prisons. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons, Cohen said, told him in a letter last week that he is ‚Äúnot entitled to any credits for his work performed at FCI Otisville,\" the federal lockup in New York where he served more than a year. Cohen said the letter left him ‚Äúat a loss‚Äù and did not address time credits owed to him under the First Step Act, which encourages inmates to participate in programs aimed at reducing recidivism. ‚ÄúThis absurd response by the government is nothing more than a stonewall tactic,‚Äù Cohen wrote in the filings. It's possible, he added, \"that he has already served well past his release date.‚Äù The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After his initial release, Cohen returned to prison for two weeks in July after an earlier run-in with the Bureau of...
