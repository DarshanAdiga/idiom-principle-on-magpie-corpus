To step out of the elevator onto the fifth floor of the Whitney Museum into the newly installed exhibition Vida Americana Mexican Muralists Remake American Art is equivalent to walking into a time warp. One is back in Greenwich Village of ninety years ago when José Clemente Orozco was painting frescoes on the walls of Joseph Urban’s New School building on 12th Street, when David Alfaro Siqueiros conducted a workshop in experimental technology at Union Square, and Diego Rivera brushed a head of Lenin into his outsize mural for Rockefeller Center. Not only has the Whitney achieved a tour de force in replicating immovable (or destroyed) frescoes and unearthing little-known works by American artists responding to the Mexicans, but it has written a neglected chapter back into the history of American art.

Union minister Smriti Irani said on Saturday she was enraged that the death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape case were making a mockery of justice by their delaying tactics and asserted that urgent steps were required to stop it. We need to go a step forward, especially with regard to the conviction rates... what we saw in the Nirbhaya case and it is happening. The fact that rapists can throw caution to the winds, the fact that they can laugh in the face of justice is a fact that enrages me no end, she said inaugurating a national conference on women in police and Central Armed Police Forces, organised by the Bureau of Police Research and Development BPRD.The Union women and child development minister said urgent steps are needed to ensure that such mockery of justice does not take place anymore. Since the issue Nirbhaya case has not come to end, I will request the MHA that after the hanging of these convicts, all arms of the government need to sit down along with the judiciary to see to it that once evidence has been collected and once a decision has been made by courts, this mockery of justice does not happen, Irani said. A trial court in Delhi issued fresh warrants on Thursday with March 20, 5.30 am, as the date for the execution of the Nirbhaya case convicts -- Mukesh Singh 32, Pawan Gupta 25, Vinay Sharma 26 and Akshay Kumar Singh 31 after a series of mercy petitions and pleas being filed by them were rejected.The execution of their death warrants has been deferred thrice so far due to delays by them in exhausting legal remedies. All the convicts in the case are to be hanged together. At the conference, she urged the BPRD, a police think-tank under the home ministry, to help her ministry in framing procedures to ensure that children of under-trial women are helped so that they do not suffer.These children have no role in the crime committed and I would like to offer the services of my ministry to BPRD so that a joint effort in this context is undertaken as it is the need of the hour, Irani said. Similar steps need to be taken to improve the condition of under-trial women in jails, she said.The minister added that a historic step is being taken with regard to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences POCSO Act, in conjunction with the BPRD, NIMHANS and NALSAR, as these organisations will soon go to each district of the country to engage with every stakeholder in this domain. Irani said her ministry has also sanctioned procurement of forensic kits, as requested by the BPRD, under the Nirbhaya fund.She asked the police think-tank to help in framing of standard operating procedures for about 700 one-stop centres that act as the first point of contact for female victims across the country. BPRD Director General V S K Kaumudi said, Individuals with criminal mindset misuse the cyber platform for targeting women through Internet. Crime against women are often un-reported and even if they are reported they do not end up in conviction, the BPRD chief said, adding that the conviction rate of women-centric cyber crimes in 2018 was only 15.6 per cent..

A Kashmiri pandit, whose father was killed by terrorists in 1997, on Saturday moved the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, seeking a CBI probe into a slew of terror cases against outlawed terror outfit JKLF former leader Farooq Ahmed Dar alias Bitta Karate. Karate, who was arrested last year by the National Investigation Agency in a terror funding case, had earlier been in jail for nearly 16 years between November 1990 and 2006 on various charges ranging from murders to other heinous acts terrorism.He was was granted bail by a TADA court in 2006 on ground of inordinate delay in framing of charges against him. After his release, Karate had parted ways with Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front led by Mohammad Yasin Malik and is now part of another faction of the JKLF. The plea against Karate to the high court was made by Vikas Raina, a migrant Kashmiri pandit, whose father Ashok Raina, the principal of a higher secondary school, was killed by Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists in Gool in 1997 along with two other teachers of the school.In his petition, filed through advocate Utsav Singh Bains, Raina has annexed a list FIRs pertaining to a series of heinous cases of murder and other acts of terrorism, pending against Karate. Seeking a fresh investigation by the CBI into cases against Karate, Raina has also annexed a video footage with his petition in which Karate is purportedly seen confessing to having killed 20 kashmiri pandits on camera, a court official said.He said Rainas petition is likely to come up for hearing by the high court on March 11. Seeking the transfer of cases against Karate to the CBI and their trial to Jammu, Raina also referred to his release by TADA court, saying that the apathy of the government and the police has led to a travesty of justice in which a dreaded terrorist like Karate has walked out after murdering scores of Kashmiri Pandits. This is not only haunting the migrant Kashmiri pandits but also shakes the confidence of law-abiding citizens of this country in the criminal justice system, the petition said..

So, first, what’s right about the mayor’s proposal? It comes from his heart. De Blasio has not had an easy mayoralty—which maybe no one does—but he, in particular, got to override the White House, which was hostile to cities, especially sanctuary cities. So why not defy lame ducking and do something that is not lame, like not clefting the poorest among us? As Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer said at the rollout at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine in December of this bold program, “The city has the money; the cardinal has the land. Do it—but don’t do shelter. Do housing.” Of course, she was right. Housing, not shelter, is the solution to homelessness.

The Swiss government is working on directing support to companies hit by falling demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak and will not adopt a broad stimulus program, a top official said on Saturday.

Government subsidies paid to staff put on short working hours by their employers have been shown to be an effective economic stabilizer, she said.The government was also looking to target support at companies such as event managers which are likely to be hit by government restrictions including a temporary ban on events that draw more than 1,000 people. Ineichen-Fleisch said supply chains were still functioning and company inventories were well-stocked, but she added that could change in a month depending on the spread of the virus which has infected hundreds and killed one person in Switzerland so far.The situation will leave marks on our economy, how deep we dont know yet, she said. Asked about calls for the Swiss National Bank to help address the widening economic impact, she said the central bank was independent and would make its own decisions.

The Indian government has passed a resolution to this effect. Has Madhya Pradeshs Congress regime recognized Azad Kashmir He also alleged that senior Congress leaders use the same terminology as do Pakistan and separatists.He also demanded that a sedition case be registered against the person responsible for this gaffe. Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja said chief minister Nath expressed anger over the incident. On Naths orders, two officials were suspended, Saluja added.An MPBSE official said the paper setter and the moderator were suspended and disciplinary action would be taken against them.

The mayor is also putting the arm on many houses of worship—asking whether we can take people in if the city “retrofits” our spaces. It is not a secret that many houses of worship are sitting on land that could be used for the wider community as well as for its adherents. Moreover, if the city will help houses of worship to shelter, by putting in showers, beds, and privacy shields, mission consistency doubles. The city does what it can and should and so do the religious groups. The strategy is to retrofit places that can accommodate at least a dozen people; and the better price point for the retrofitting is with small groups of 70 or so. The program is state of the art housing thinking.
