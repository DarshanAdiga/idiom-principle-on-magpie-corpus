With the COVID-19 pandemic and the initiation of government mandated closures to ensure everyone’s safety, few have been harder hit than farmers. With traditional farmers’ markets sidelined by the virus this year, many have sought alternate ways to market and sell their produce. One of these farmers is Switzer’s Farm, who have turned to selling their wares directly from their farm on Clear Lake Road, just east of Bancroft.   Jarrett and Dannielle Switzer and father Conrad run the family business now, a 200 acre farm that’s been going for over five generations. Jarrett’s grandfather Alfred started the farmers’ market in Bancroft, and they have been selling fruits and vegetables in town since the mid 1970’s.   With this year’s pivot to selling their produce from their farm, Dannielle reveals that at first, they didn’t know what to do.   “Jarrett was on the fence. We have the little one to consider too (their toddler Kurt). And they said we could be out there, but it’s hard to know. You could put fibreglass around if you want but it’s hard. You have all kinds of people coming at you, and there’s no way for him to wash his hands. You can have hand sanitizer, but it’s not as good. This way, you can run right into the house and wash your hands and it’s done. And there’s no washrooms open either so it would have been an awfully long day. And being outside here at the farm, it really gives people a chance to see where their produce is coming from too, which is a great thing,” she says.   While Dannielle thinks that this new initiative is kind of exciting, it is also a learning curve.   “We’ve got order forms, trying to advertise, advertise, advertise. But so far it seems, we had our first day last Friday and it went over very well actually. We had well over 30 people and a lot of them ordered the bags,” she says.   Dannielle is referring to the produce bags they have on sale through their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/switzersfarmbancroft   The bags come in three sizes; Seniors/Singles, Couples and Families. They retail for $20, $25 and $30 respectively and the contents vary week by week, for whatever is in season when you buy the bag. For the week of July 6, the contents included mini potatoes, radishes, leaf lettuce, green onions, mushrooms, hot house tomatoes, English cucumbers and red peppers.   “Our produce bags we’re doing, we switched them to brown paper bags, write the customers’ name on them, hand them over and away they go. It’s contactless and a safer way to go,” she says.   In addition to the bags, they also have strawberries, peas, grape tomatoes and rhubarb that can be added on to your order.   Customers are advised to order by calling or texting 613-334-1746 or by email at jswitzer655@gmail.com by Tuesdays at 7 p.m. for pickup on Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. or Monday from 9 a.m. to noon. Payment is by e-transfer or by cash at the farm.   Dannielle says the produce bags are not too labour intensive, and she has folders she keeps for each day to keep everything organized.   “Thursday night we go out and pick everything for Friday and that’s done. Takes a couple of hours or so depending on how much you have. It’s not too bad and then you write out whatever they got on the bag. Extra stuff you write on there as well, and it works out all right. And the green onions we run and pick them fresh in the morning and put them in the bags so they stay nice. Lettuce is the same way. But it’s all coming along,” she says.   The mini potatoes are new to the bags this week, and Dannielle says they haven’t even had any yet.   “A customer came in this morning and asked if the potatoes were ready. We hadn’t dug any but you dig them fresh, and she just wanted a small container. She’s the first one to have them, even before the farmer,” she says.   So far, Dannielle says it’s really going over well with their customers, and people really like the bags. They have been advertising on their Facebook page and have run an ad on the radio.   “Everybody says they love the idea and they say they like the safeness of it, not having to venture into town with everything going on,” she says.   According to the Switzers, some customer favourites include tomatoes, corn, raspberries, strawberries and little pickling cucumbers.   Jarrett thinks having people come to them is nice because it frees him up.   “I can go pick stuff and not be in town all the time. I can go do hay, prune trees, I can get firewood delivered. I can do other stuff too,” he says.   He also points out that it precludes food waste, as people order exactly what they want and pick it up. With the market, he would usually bring an assortment of products into town, and whatever he didn’t sell that day would go to waste, as it would sit in the hot sun all day.   While most of the Switzer’s fields are planted with cash crops to be sold throughout the season, some of it has buckwheat planted on it, which gives the field a rest in between crops. Jarrett Switzer says that if you plant buckwheat and till it into the ground it’s good for it.   “It’s a natural way of building the ground up, better than using fertilizer and stuff,” he says.   With the success of their initiative, the Switzers are thinking of having different sales strategies for each season, as they sell a multitude of crops. For instance, in the fall they have pumpkins and in the winter they have maple syrup and Christmas trees.   Terry Woodrow is a local who comes by to get a bag of produce, and she thinks it’s amazing to be able to pick up something locally like this.   “I was in last week and I picked up strawberries, and they were so good. So, I’m pretty well finished. I made jam, rhubarb strawberry crisp and just froze some. So, I’m here today to get my vegetables and they should be awesome,” she says.   Gwen Coish, who works for Bancroft Community Transit, comes by to pick up some strawberries and some asparagus, and thinks the whole idea is fantastic.   “I love it. Fresh strawberries, typically I pick, but with COVID-19 I haven’t been able to do that. This is actually more convenient. As a working mom, it’s way more convenient. So, I appreciate the convenience of this and I appreciate being able to pop out here. I called yesterday and it was ready today. With all this stuff going on, I wasn’t sure how I was going to get my fresh berries this year. I’m very appreciative of it,” she says. “And asparagus is my husband’s favourite, so he’ll love that.”

Now that Season 2 is almost over, secrets are coming out and relationships are getting tense.

Raymond Arnold lived to see the day.
   
 He never thought he would.
   
 Arnold, a Spartanburg resident, was on the pit crew and became chief mechanic for Wendell Scott, one of NASCAR's first black drivers, a Hall of Famer, and still the only African-American to ever win race at the circuit's highest level. Arnold sat in his bed, less than a month before his passing, and held a model car in his hands. It was the No. 43 famously associated with Richard Petty, now driven by Bubba Wallace, the only black driver in the series, and it was autographed by both.
   
 That day, June 10, two days after Wallace pleaded a case that had been made upon deaf ears for decades, NASCAR banned the Confederate flag from its events.
   
 "He was in disbelief," said his daughter, Toni Arnold-McFarland. "He said, 'I don't really know it is really going to happen.' I gave him that car sent to him by a racing enthusiast and my dad just kind of looked at it and held on to it. You could tell he was going back through his life and was thinking about how things could've been so different if this moment had happened 50 years before."
   
 Arnold died on July 7. A memorial service was held 10 days later, Friday evening, at the most appropriate place, the Piedmont Interstate Fairgrounds, more commonly known as the Spartanburg County Fairgrounds, near downtown. You would never know it by looking at it today, except for the remaining barriers around overgrown weeds, but this was the center of the NASCAR world in 1961, when Arnold went to watch this black driver he had heard so much about from his friend David Pearson, who became arguably - up against Petty and later Dale Earnhardt - the greatest driver in the history of their sport.
   
 And on that day, Scott's NASCAR Grand National debut on March 4 of 1961, Arnold was troubled by the fact that Scott didn't have enough help in the pits or in the garage. So Arnold actually came out of the stands to offer help. Arnold ended up taking the carburetor off his own automobile to put in the race car. From that day on, Scott and Arnold stayed as close as close can be. Arnold became a trusted source both on and off the track.
   
 Consider that this was during the height of the Civil Rights unrest. It was less than six months from when 6-year-old Ruby Bridges had to be escorted by four armed federal marshals to become the first student to integrate an elementary school in New Orleans. Throughout 1961, there were the "Freedom Rides" throughout the South, and they were marked by violence. Civil rights leader and U.S. representative John Lewis, who died Friday, was one of the 13 original Freedom Riders recruited by and often stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Martin Luther King Jr.
   
 "The Confederate flag is actually heritage to a lot of people," said Scott's son, Frankie, a gifted mechanic in his own right who witnessed discrimination first-hand from a young age. "And a lot of that is not bad. But when you come to a race track, it's something you should not have to deal with. On your own property, that's fine. On your own vehicle, that's fine. But when people come to a race track, there is a lot of bad history associated with that flag.
   
 "We are hoping that society will realize that it's time for a change. I think it's going to help NASCAR in the long run. You don't want to come to the track and hear derogatory terms when you have paid your money to come. You just want to enjoy good racing. It's a good thing and it's long overdue. … NASCAR seems to realize that now is finally the time."
   
 "This should have happened sooner," said Arnold-McFarland. "We should be further along. We want this to be a learning time. It's time for us to move forward. We need more diversity in the sport."
   
 Perry Allen Wood was 9 years old and at the Spartanburg track when Arnold helped Scott make his Grand National debut. Wood is now a NASCAR historian, noted author and co-host of a weekly radio show on 1400 AM Spartanburg called "Start Your Engines."
   
 "From what I gather," Wood said, "Arnold was a well-known person around the local shops. Pearson would have had to have known Wendell through short-track races. So it's interesting that he introduced to the two if that is the case."
   
 Scott's car lasted only 52 laps in that first race and the carburetor went back in Arnold's car so he could get home. The top three, in order, were Spartanburg's Cotton Owens, Petty and Pearson. Ned Jarrett's car had oil pressure failure, same thing that got Scott, and was 16th, one spot and two laps ahead of Scott.
   
 Scott never had a sponsor or a manufacturer backing his team. He took broken car parts discarded from other drivers and searched junk yards. Arnold was instrumental, through his connections, in helping Scott find pieces to put together a car to race. Their goal was not necessarily to win but to finish, hopefully in the top 10, to get paid and continue racing.
   
 In nearly 500 races over his 13-year career, Scott had a top-10 finish 147 times and won the Jacksonville (Fla.) 200 in 1964 by passing Petty near the end. With a strong backing and an even playing field, who knows how good Scott could have been.
   
 "I'm not going to tell you he would've been a track champion," Wood said. "But he might have been."
   
 Interestingly enough, Arnold missed that only victory. He was a teacher, most recently until his retirement at Eastside High School in Taylors, and could only get to the races closer to the upstate.

 MILLERSBURG -- It was a night for familiar faces in victory lane with fans gathering on the Hill to cheer on their favorite drivers.  
 Starting off the night's events were the Holmes Tire late models with Ryan Markham setting fast time among 17 (15.057) and picking up heat race one. The heat two win went to Corey Conley.  
 Setting the pace to the green, Markham and Conley went side-by-side into turn one. Conley got the run off turn two and took the lead with one lap in the books. Three laps down, caution came out. Conley retained the top spot on the restart as Dave Hornikel challenged Markham for second. Ten laps in, Conley began navigating his way through lap traffic as eighth place Rick Mardis started working his way up to challenge the top five. With 17 laps down, caution once again came out, bunching the field up for the restart. Back under green, Conley again took the top spot as a three-wide battle between Markham, Brandon Francis and Mardis ensued. Five laps to go, Mardis secured third from Francis and looked in on Markham, but he was unable to surpass him as the checkered flag dropped. After leading all 25 laps with no real challenge, it was Conley picking up the victory. Conley was followed by Markham, Mardis, Francis and Shane McLoughlin.  
 The Bugs-R-Gone modified division featured a field of 13 with Kyle Moore setting fast time (16.336) and picking up a heat race win. Robin Duston got the win in heat two. Bringing the field to the green, Moore jumped out front with one lap down. Second place Jess Hartman was challenged on the outside by George Lee, who claimed second off turn four. Duston later took third, leaving Hartman and D.J. Cline in a battle for fourth. Side by side, the two flipped positions back and forth. As the laps dwindled, Moore advanced his lead over the field, working up to lap traffic with nine down. Caution free and 20 laps in the books, Moore put a half-track distance between himself and Lee, picking up another win on the season. Third went to Duston, fourth to Cline and fifth to Jess Hartman.  
 A field of seven made up the Crozier Welding truck division with a single heat race win going to Rolly Heyder. After redrawing for the feature, it was Heyder and Travis Hare sitting on the front row for the night's 12-lap feature event. Side by side for lap one, Heyder edged out over Hare to claim the lead at the line. Lap after lap, Hare challenged Heyder for the top spot. Four laps to go, caution came out. Heyder again claimed the top spot on the restart and that is where he remained, fending off Hare to pick up the feature win. Hare finished second followed by Dwayne Powell, Chad Squires and Evan Large.  
 With a field of 24, the Snyder Hot Shot Truck and Trailer modlites had three heats, with wins going to Joe Burkhead, Clint Snyder and Jimmy Smith. A top three redraw after the heats placed Emmet Myers and Tanner McLoughlin on the front row for the night's 15-lap feature.  
 After a number of cautions to start the race, the green was back out and McLoughlin took the top spot with Smith all over his bumper. Lap for lap, Smith challenged McLoughlin. Unfortunately, contact between the two in turn three and four brought out the caution. Eight laps down and the green back out, McLoughlin took the lead. However, he had troubles coming off turn four on lap 10, ending his night and placing Joe Burkhead out front. Eleven laps in, caution came out once more, bunching the field up to the restart. Burkhead, retaining the lead, was challenged by Braxton Wilson as the green came back out. The next three laps Wilson worked the bumper of Burkhead, looking for this way to the front. However, with one lap to go, Wilson spun in turn one and two, bringing out the caution. With a final restart to checker, Burkhead retained the top spot, picking up the feature win. Rounding out the top five was Jon Preston, Clint Snyder, Blake Morris and Jimmy Smith  
 The night's events ended with the Short Track Safety Team mini stocks with a 13-car field. Heat race winners were Colton St. John and Ed Geary. A top three redraw set the field with St. John and John Wheeler on the front row. With the drop of the green, St. John took the lead followed by Geary and Billy Parsons. With five laps down, St. John was out front with nearly a straightaway lead. Geary and Parsons battled it out for second just as caution flew. St. John again claim the top spot on the restart and that is where he stayed, leading green to checker and adding to his victories for the season. Geary finished second followed by Parsons, Darrin Thornsley and Kevin Markey.

New research out of Stanford University suggests erasing memories associated with opioid addiction could eliminate the triggers that lead to drug cravings and relapse into addiction. A fascinating animal study has demonstrated that by blocking a specific neural pathway, animals addicted to morphine effectively forget the drug’s effects and cease addictive behaviors.
 Xiaoke Chen, lead investigator on the research, previously homed in on a specific part of the brain in the thalamus called the paraventricular nucleus (PVT). Chen’s research revealed PVT activity played a major role in activating addictive drug behaviors, so the new study set out to investigate whether temporarily silencing this specific pathway could alter drug-seeking behavior.
 The new study first generated a memory-dependent morphine addiction in a cohort of mice. For several days the animals were presented with a two-sided chamber, saline on one side and a morphine-dosed solution on the other. After just five days the animals had developed a preference for the morphine solution.
 The researchers then presented the animals with the two-sided chamber while using optogenetics to silence a key PVT pathway. With this pathway turned off the animals displayed no preference for the morphine solution. But even more interesting, when tested again the following day without actively silencing the PVT pathway, the animals still showed no preference for the morphine solution.
 This intriguing finding suggests temporarily inhibiting this PVT pathway after cueing specific drug behaviors may somehow erase the memories that trigger the addictive preferences. Chen hypothesizes drug addiction to essentially be a memory problem, and by disrupting the memories underpinning both the drug’s reward and withdrawal associations, the compulsion to seek the drug could be effectively erased.
 “Our data suggest that after silencing this PVT pathway, environmental cues will not work to reactivate this memory,” says Chen. “We haven’t tested a later time point than two weeks. But we think it’s very likely the memory is just gone.”
 Recalling similar recent research into methods for editing, or erasing memories, Chen suggests the key to effectively manipulating the drug- associated memory is by silencing this PVT pathway while the memory is being recalled. Disrupting the pathway during the memory reconsolidation process allows for a highly specific form of memory erasure.
 “The memory first needs to be reactivated to provide an opportunity for precise memory manipulation,” explains Chen. “You don’t want to erase the entire memory; you only want to erase the part that’s associated with the drug.”
 While this kind of optogenetic disruption of brain activity can be evoked in humans using deep brain stimulation, it is way too invasive to be effectively deployed as a therapy. So this compelling research finding will not immediately translate into a treatment for drug addiction in people.
 However, Chen does note the study shines a light on a novel neural pathway that seems to play a fundamental role in addiction behaviors. And if this pathway can be influenced through means less invasive than literally implanting electrodes in one’s brain, then new treatments for addressing drug addiction could be developed.
 “Drugs as a stimulus can drive a very robust behavior,” says Chen. “I want to understand the mechanism underlying that behavior and hope that this knowledge can help address the devastating opioid epidemic in the U.S.”
 The new study was published in the journal _Neuron_.

"Ich bin Teil des Bundesvorstandes, deswegen gilt das für mich auch." Ihr Ziel sei es aber, "dass die Partei im Dezember organisatorisch, inhaltlich und personell besser aufgestellt ist."
 Bislang werde das Treffen der 1001 Delegierten unter den Auflagen der Corona- Pandemie mit Begrenzungen bei der Personenzahl und Abstandsregeln geplant, sagte Kramp-Karrenbauer. Mit den drei Bewerbern um den Vorsitz stehe sie in ständigem Kontakt. Nach der Sommerpause wolle sie mit ihnen besprechen, wie der Fahrplan bis zum Parteitag aussehen werde - und wie die Kandidaten die Situation sähen. "Ich gehe bei allen dreien davon aus, dass sie zu ihrer Kandidatur stehen. Zumindest habe ich keine anderen Signale bisher."
 In der CDU wird spekuliert, ob Laschet wegen seiner eher schlechten persönlichen Umfragewerte doch noch die Rolle mit seinem Teampartner Jens Spahn tauschen könnte - und der Bundesgesundheitsminister selbst für den Parteivorsitz antritt.

Salgının istihdama etkilerini azaltmak amacıyla, hem işvereni hem işçiyi korumak için yaşama geçirilen istihdam paketi bu hafta Meclis Genel Kurulu'nda görüşülecek. İşyerlerinin normale dönmesini sağlamak için aylık 4 milyar destek verilirken 3 ayda bu destek 12 milyar liraya ulaşacak. Plan ve Bütçe Komisyonu Başkanı Lütfü Elvan, Aile, Çalışma ve Sosyal Güvenlik Bakanı Zehra Zümrüt'le yaptığı görüşmeye göre 12 milyar liranın maksimum tutar olduğunu, tahmini beklentisinin bu tutarın yüzde 50'si civarında yani ilk üç ayda 6-7 milyar lira civarında olacağını söyledi. 2021'E KADAR UZATILABİLECEK Pandemi döneminin istihdama etkilerini azaltmak için getirilen önlemlerde sürelerin yeniden belirlenmesi konusunda yeni düzenlemeler getiren mini istihdam paketi Plan Bütçe Komisyonu'nda kabul edildi.

KIDEM TAZMİNATI KORUNUYOR ÇALIŞMA Genel Müdürü Nurcan Ender, pandemi nedeniyle ücretsiz izne çıkartılan işçinin bu durumu haklı fesih yaparak iş akdini feshettiğinde kıdem tazminatı alabileceğini söyledi. Ücretsiz izin sürecine ilişkin soruları yanıtlayan Çalışma Genel Müdürü Ender, işçinin bu dönemde başka bir iş bulup ayrıldığında kıdem alıp alamayacağı konusunda 'Bu ilave edilen düzenlemelerin içinde değil ama kendi isteğiyle ayrılırsa yanar' dedi. Komisyon görüşmesi sırasında TİSK işçi ile işverenin karşılıklı anlaşarak ikale sözleşmesi ile iş akdini sonlandırması halinin istisna tutulmasını talep etti. Türk-İş de TİSK'in önerisini destekleyerek nasıl işveren tek taraflı olarak ücretsiz izne çıkartabiliyorsa, işçinin de haklı nedenle iş akdini feshedebilmesine olanak sağlanmasını istedi. AYLIK DESTEK 1.177 TL Aylık nakdi ücret desteği brüt bin 177 lira, net bin 168 lira olacak. Nisan ve ayıs aylarında 1 milyon 358 bin işçi ücretsiz izne çıkarken, 1 milyar 701 milyon lira nakdi ücret desteği verildi. Haziran ayında ise ücretsiz izne çıkarılan 1 milyon 705 bin kişiye 1.1 milyar ödenirken, toplamda üç aylık dönemde ödenen tutar 2.8 milyar lira oldu. Düzenleme kapsamında İşsizlik Sigortası Fonu tarafından işverene sağlanan, sigortalı hissesine karşılık gelen destek tutarının sigortalıya ödenmesi işverenden talep edilemeyecek. Fon'dan düzenleme kapsamında karşılanan tutarlar, gelir ve kurumlar vergisi uygulamalarında gelir, gider veya maliyet unsuru olarak dikkate alınmayacak.

MILLERSBURG -- It was a night for familiar faces in victory lane with fans gathering on the Hill to cheer on their favorite drivers.  
 Starting off the night's events were the Holmes Tire late models with Ryan Markham setting fast time among 17 (15.057) and picking up heat race one. The heat two win went to Corey Conley.  
 Setting the pace to the green, Markham and Conley went side-by-side into turn one. Conley got the run off turn two and took the lead with one lap in the books. Three laps down, caution came out. Conley retained the top spot on the restart as Dave Hornikel challenged Markham for second. Ten laps in, Conley began navigating his way through lap traffic as eighth place Rick Mardis started working his way up to challenge the top five. With 17 laps down, caution once again came out, bunching the field up for the restart. Back under green, Conley again took the top spot as a three-wide battle between Markham, Brandon Francis and Mardis ensued. Five laps to go, Mardis secured third from Francis and looked in on Markham, but he was unable to surpass him as the checkered flag dropped. After leading all 25 laps with no real challenge, it was Conley picking up the victory. Conley was followed by Markham, Mardis, Francis and Shane McLoughlin.  
 The Bugs-R-Gone modified division featured a field of 13 with Kyle Moore setting fast time (16.336) and picking up a heat race win.  Robin Duston got the win in heat two. Bringing the field to the green, Moore jumped out front with one lap down. Second place Jess Hartman was challenged on the outside by George Lee, who claimed second off turn four. Duston later took third, leaving Hartman and D.J. Cline in a battle for fourth. Side by side, the two flipped positions back and forth. As the laps dwindled, Moore advanced his lead over the field, working up to lap traffic with nine down. Caution free and 20 laps in the books, Moore put a half-track distance between himself and Lee, picking up another win on the season. Third went to Duston, fourth to Cline and fifth to Jess Hartman.  
 A field of seven made up the Crozier Welding truck division with a single heat race win going to Rolly Heyder. After redrawing for the feature, it was Heyder and Travis Hare sitting on the front row for the night's 12-lap feature event. Side by side for lap one, Heyder edged out over Hare to claim the lead at the line. Lap after lap, Hare challenged Heyder for the top spot. Four laps to go, caution came out. Heyder again claimed the top spot on the restart and that is where he remained, fending off Hare to pick up the feature win. Hare finished second followed by Dwayne Powell, Chad Squires and Evan Large.  
 With a field of 24, the Snyder Hot Shot Truck and Trailer modlites had three heats, with wins going to Joe Burkhead, Clint Snyder and Jimmy Smith. A top three redraw after the heats placed Emmet Myers and Tanner McLoughlin on the front row for the night's 15-lap feature.  
 After a number of cautions to start the race, the green was back out and McLoughlin took the top spot with Smith all over his bumper. Lap for lap, Smith challenged McLoughlin. Unfortunately, contact between the two in turn three and four brought out the caution. Eight laps down and the green back out, McLoughlin took the lead. However, he had troubles coming off turn four on lap 10, ending his night and placing Joe Burkhead out front. Eleven laps in, caution came out once more, bunching the field up to the restart. Burkhead, retaining the lead, was challenged by Braxton Wilson as the green came back out. The next three laps Wilson worked the bumper of Burkhead, looking for this way to the front. However, with one lap to go, Wilson spun in turn one and two, bringing out the caution. With a final restart to checker, Burkhead retained the top spot, picking up the feature win. Rounding out the top five was Jon Preston, Clint Snyder, Blake Morris and Jimmy Smith  
 The night's events ended with the Short Track Safety Team mini stocks with a 13-car field. Heat race winners were Colton St. John and Ed Geary. A top three redraw set the field with St. John and John Wheeler on the front row. With the drop of the green, St. John took the lead followed by Geary and Billy Parsons. With five laps down, St. John was out front with nearly a straightaway lead. Geary and Parsons battled it out for second just as caution flew. St. John again claim the top spot on the restart and that is where he stayed, leading green to checker and adding to his victories for the season. Geary finished second followed by Parsons, Darrin Thornsley and Kevin Markey.

Cyprus amended its Constitution in 2013 to allow for the extradition of Cypriot nationals to a European country or to a third country on the basis of a European arrest warrant or on the basis of a bilateral or multilateral treaty that the Republic of Cyprus has signed, with the understanding that the corresponding country would extradite its citizens as well. In 2003, the United States and the European Union entered into an extradition agreement. The articles of the U.S.-E.U. agreement were incorporated into the pre- existing bilateral treaty to create a new bilateral treaty with Cyprus, signed in 2006.

Fortunately, Webb reports that the dog who needed emergency attention has recovered fully, but she says people should take it seriously when they notice their dogs panting more, getting tired, and wanting shorter walks. The loyal nature of dogs can be their biggest downfall. Webb says that when dogs are out on walks , "They try to keep going with their owner. If the owner has a way to go back to the car, they may end up having to carry the dog, which isn't easy when it is a medium-to-large dog like a Labrador."

The bodywork, naturally, is all carbon, and this is where GFG Style has placed most of its pride. As a barchetta, it's totally devoid of any roof, and its key design feature is a pair of spaghetti-strap "structural pillars" rising up from the front mudguard and stretching all the way back to the rear spoiler.
 These flying buttress-style features allow the Dora to rock a wrap-around windshield that looks like it extends all the way to the back of the doors in a single piece. It doesn't; the joins are hidden beneath the pillar thingies so the doors can open upwards.
 Behind the cabin, a rollover bar is presented as an aesthetic element, joining the two rear wheel arches as a gentle curve. There are lightning bolt shapes in the headlight and taillight assemblies, and the flip-up active spoiler is really the only part of the car that seems overly worried about downforce. There are no splitters, diffusers, flicks, or other wind tunnel specials on board; this is a casino-to-beach cruiser not a lap time predator.

 ORRVILLE -- It was another action-packed night of racing on Saturday at Wayne County Speedway.  
 The Pine Tree Towing & Recovery Sprints returned to action. The front row of R.J. Jacobs and Jason Dolick set the early pace as they dueled back and forth for the lead in the first seven laps with several lead changes between the two. Wooster's Dean Jacobs took over second from R.J. Jacobs on lap eight and then overtook Dolick coming out of turn two on the next circuit. From that point on, Dean Jacobs led the way to his second win of the season. Dolick stayed close to the winner for second, while R.J. Jacobs fell back into a battle for third with Jordan Ryan. The two made contact on lap 21, resulting in Jacobs' night ending with front-end damage. Ryan continued on to finish third. Fast qualifier Trey Jacobs finished fourth and Tyler Street grabbed fifth and the Hard Charger Award after starting 10th. The red flag waved before the field made one lap as rookie Wyatt Zimmerman took a tumble in turn three. Heat wins went to Trey and Dean Jacobs.  
 J.R. Gentry started on the pole of the Malcuit Tavern Super Late Model feature, held off early challenges from Jerry Bowersock and led all the way to claim his second victory of the season. Bowersock ran race long in second. In the middle part of the race, Brad Malcuit, Cody Scott and Larry Bellman were changing positions on each circuit while Mitch Caskey -- last week's winner -- was moving through the field. With two laps to go, Scott suffered a flat tire and dropped out. Caskey got past Bellman for fourth following Malcuit across the line, with Bellman taking fifth. Caskey started 15th and collected the Hard Charger Award. Matt Irey and Gentry posted heat wins and Will Thomas collected the $200 Quick Time Award.  
 Scott Peltz used the outside front row starting spot to lead the way for the opening four laps before giving way to Joel Watson, but his time out front lasted only one lap as Mansfield's Kyle Moore took over. Starting seventh, and with a bounty riding on his shoulders, Moore took the point coming out of turn two and never looked back for his third win at \"Orrville's Historic Oval.\" He swept the night as he pocketed the $100 Quick Time Award and won his heat race. A caution with five laps to go gave Casey Fritz, who came on strong in the last half of the feature, a chance at Moore on the restart. But Moore used the high groove to pull away. Peltz finished third with DJ Cline and Steve Rex filling out the top five. Fritz and Nathan Loney also were heat winners.  
 Moore returned to victory lane in the McKenzie Concrete Super Stock feature. He started on the pole but early cautions kept the field bunched together, which gave Michael Amick a chance. Amick swiped the top spot away from Moore on lap five and stayed out front for the next four circuits. Moore later recaptured the lead and pulled away for his second win of the night. Amick cruised to a second-place finish as it was a dogfight for third place between John Wilson, Brandon Craver, Chase Alexander and Gary Hensel Jr. The quartet ultimately finished in that order. Don Rutt -- who was involved in a red flag incident with Mike McElravy in the feature -- Wilson and Moore topped the heat races. Brandon Morrow picked up the $100 Quick Time Award.  
 It was a rough and tumble feature for the JoyRide Transport feature that saw Steven Lester roll in turn one at the start of the race. Once the feature went green, it was a six-car battle for the lead between Chaz Dawson -- the leader for the first five laps -- Cory Staley, Doug Hensel, Jordan James, Dustin Bedlion and Colton St. John. James took the lead on a restart on lap six and the Loudonville driver stayed out front for his first win. Bedlion took second with Staly taking third, followed by Johnny Bruce Sr. and Dakota Graciani. Dawson, St. John and Hensel had problems late in the race. Ryan Carder won the last chance race for the second week in a row as Staley, Bedlion and Hensel scored the heat wins.  
 Racing action next Saturday will be the Buckeye Late Model Dirt week with the Hans and Don Gross Memorial and $3,000 going to the winner of the Malcuit Tavern Super Late Models. The Pine Tree Towing & Recovery Sprints, the McKenzie Concrete Super Stocks and the JoyRide Transport Mini Stocks are on the racing card as well. Gates open at 3 p.m. and racing starts at 7 p.m.

Craven County students will return to school next month with a mix of in person classroom and remote instruction, according to a plan approved by the Craven County Board of Education on July 16. County schools have been closed since March 16 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 Under the state's Plan B-Option 3 guidelines approved by the Board, students will be placed on a rotation schedule, with all schools closed for cleaning on Wednesdays, which will be remote learning days for all grades. Kindergarten students will attend school four days a week, Monday-Tuesday and Thursday- Friday. Grades 1-5 will attend class two days a week and learn from home the other three days. Those students will be placed in groups that determine which days of the week they are in the classroom. The AA group will attend in person Mondays and Tuesdays, while the BB group will attend Thursdays and Fridays.
   
 Middle and high school students will attend one day per week in person on a rotating schedule and will be assigned a letter A through D. A students will attend in person on Mondays, B students on Tuesdays, C on Thursdays and D on Fridays.
   
 Students in the Exceptional Children and English Second Language programs, as well as those that do not have Internet access at their homes, will have the option to attend every day as well.
   
 Parents will also have the option of enrolling students in Craven Live, the county's remote instruction program. Registration for Craven Live began Friday, July 17 and will continue through Thursday, July 23. Students who enroll in Craven Live will be required to commit to remote instruction for at least one semester. All students who register for Craven Live will be accepted.
   
 "As we try to meet the demands for the very different choices and health concerns that our families and staff have we want to make sure we can offer as much as we practically can of both a remote-only option and a face-to-face option," said Superintendent Meghan Doyle.
   
 Under Plan B-Option 3, all K-12 students and staff will be required to wear face masks and maintain six feet social distancing, with lunches served in the classroom. Students will be allowed to remove their masks during their lunch period. Hand sanitizer will be distributed at every entrance and in each classroom and restroom.
   
 School Nurse Luanne Mack said all students riding school buses will have their temperatures checked by the bus driver. If they have a fever they will not be allowed to ride the bus that day. All K-5 students must have an adult supervising them at their bus stop. Parents of students in grades 6-12 will be notified if their child is unable to ride the bus. Carpool students and students who drive to school will have their temperatures taken and be asked COVID-related questions. If they display symptoms or answer yes to any of the questions they will not be allowed in the school.
   
 If a student displays COVID-19 like symptoms while at school, they will be placed in the quarantine room and the parents will be notified to pick them up. Depending on the symptom, the child could be required to quarantine for 10 days. If the student tests positive for COVID-19, they will not be allowed to return to school until they are symptom free for 72 hours.
   
 Doyle said the schools are taking steps to ensure students are not near one another for extended periods.
   
 "There will be a great deal of signage in our schools that is directing students about what to do," said Doyle. "They will be in the restrooms to remind students to wash their hands. We're actually making structural changes to our restrooms to separate the stalls so students are still distancing in the restrooms."
   
 According to Doyle, in the event that a student tests positive for COVID-19, the classroom will be shut down for disinfection and contact tracing will be done to identify individuals that were in close contact with the student. Doyle said a quarantine room will be set up at each school for students or staff members who test positive. She said staff members who test positive but are still able to work will be given the option of teaching remotely. Those unable to work can use sick leave or other leave options if they are under quarantine.
   
 In the event of an school outbreak, which is defined as two or more cases in the same classroom, Doyle said the teacher and students in the class will be quarantined and staff will rely on guidance from the local health department.
   
 Doyle acknowledged that a number of staff have expressed concern about returning to the classroom. She said she had reached out to Craven County Health Director Scott Harrelson regarding the safety of the school system's reopening plan. According to Doyle, Harrelson commented that healthy children are a low risk group and that since the school closures the county has seen increases in domestic violence, overdoses, local alcohol sales and visits to STD clinics.
   
 "He's of the opinion that our children need the structure of school and the outlet of athletics and other extracurricular activities back in their lives," said Doyle.

In comparison to other communities, the level of education in the Arab community is on the rise in past years. As the Arab community strives to break barriers and achieve celebrated accomplishments, we can see nowadays more and more people from the Arab world holding key positions across various industries.
 Despite all the success, there is still a clear gap between those who have succeeded, to those still aspiring to get there. Platforms that attempt to bridge this educational gap have been mostly unsuccessful in finding the right solution so far. But that’s not true for all of them. While searching for platforms that are able to bridge the gap, we notice the upcoming trend of remote learning, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. Like mushrooms after a spring rain, we see more and more companies offering a variety of remote learning packages, popping up everywhere.
 When glancing over the different companies in Israel and around the world, we notice a missing language in the remote learning scene. It’s pretty obvious that the spotlight shines bright on the American dream, its professors, its language, and its teaching methods. All around the world, we see the American dream being imitated in one way or another, from the unique teaching methods to using different languages in an effort to make it more accessible. However, even here, we see one language which is being left out - the Arabic language.
 Over the past two months, a change has taken place with a new startup called _YALLA ACADEMY_ entering the ring. With extensive activity, experienced faculty, and devoted students, you would think that this startup has been around for years, however, it exists for only a couple of months and that, more than anything, testifies to large demand and yearning coming from the Arab world.
 _YALLA ACADEMY_ uses key figures and executives from the Arab world as lecturers to run online courses and share with students their knowledge from their extensive and rich experience. While scrolling through _YALLA ACADEMY_ ’s website, the first thing you’ll notice is that there is absolutely no English or Hebrew, or any other language to be exact, except Arabic. Therefore, if you don’t read or write in the language then you are in for a pretty confusing ride. So, to further gain insight into the website’s activities we brought in an Arabic speaking friend to help us out, and we were surprised to find that the online lectures were just a part of a whole world of content.
 Every two weeks, _YALLA ACADEMY_ holds a free event open to the public that centers around a lecture from one of the academy’s partnered businessmen or lecturers. When we joined the open event we were surprised to find dozens of other people thirsty for every word coming out of the lecturer’s mouth, causing the event to last an extra hour following an extensive Q&A round at the end.
 After we were exposed to the various and diverse courses that the startup offers, our attention was then caught once again when noticing the _YALLA ACADEMY_ community. We took one of that startups’ lecturers to a quick conversation, asking him about this special community. “It’s an open forum where current and former students can connect with lecturers and industry experts to further develop ideas and ask any questions they desire”, he explains. One of the students told us that it’s an amazing first-of-its-kind Arabic-speaking networking platform for Arab entrepreneurs and students to better connect with various industry leaders and gain valuable insight into the path to success.
 _YALLA ACADEMY_ told Geektime that in light of the success of the program in the local Israeli arena and with the increasing demand for the next quarter - it intends to open the program in the European market in order to create a global Arabic-speaking community that will provide practical content from key business figures in the global Arab world.

The summer months are not the time to bring your best bud along to ride shotgun during errands. Don't leave your pet in a car on hot days, ever. Not even for a quick minute, or if you leave the windows open, or even if the car is running and the air conditioner is cranked up. Car temperatures can easily rise to over 100 degrees within ten minutes. After that, they can get up to 120 degrees or higher, fast. Dogs don't have a chance against that kind of heat. Also, it is illegal in Massachusetts to leave animals in vehicles where they are subject to danger from extreme weather conditions.

Councillor Skinner said that the feedback the council had received from public consultations were "mainly positive" but said that he wasn't aware of anti- social behaviour caused by street drinking in the redevelopment area.
 He said" There are huge benefits of having a leisure facility that works alongside health and wellbeing.
 "If someone has got good quality housing then it's likely that they will be healthy too.
 "To bring all of those facilities together under one site would be brilliant for the town.
 "I can't say about the street drinking in the area. I do sweep through the town occasionally and I do support the homeless centre in the town, although it's not something I sing about.
 "I'm aware of the main spots in town. Anything that we can do as a council to upgrade an area and make it better can only be seen as good for the town."

ORRVILLE -- It was another action-packed night of racing on Saturday at Wayne County Speedway.  
 The Pine Tree Towing & Recovery Sprints returned to action. The front row of R.J. Jacobs and Jason Dolick set the early pace as they dueled back and forth for the lead in the first seven laps with several lead changes between the two. Wooster's Dean Jacobs took over second from R.J. Jacobs on lap eight and then overtook Dolick coming out of turn two on the next circuit. From that point on, Dean Jacobs led the way to his second win of the season. Dolick stayed close to the winner for second, while R.J. Jacobs fell back into a battle for third with Jordan Ryan. The two made contact on lap 21, resulting in Jacobs' night ending with front-end damage. Ryan continued on to finish third. Fast qualifier Trey Jacobs finished fourth and Tyler Street grabbed fifth and the Hard Charger Award after starting 10th. The red flag waved before the field made one lap as rookie Wyatt Zimmerman took a tumble in turn three. Heat wins went to Trey and Dean Jacobs.  
 J.R. Gentry started on the pole of the Malcuit Tavern Super Late Model feature, held off early challenges from Jerry Bowersock and led all the way to claim his second victory of the season. Bowersock ran race long in second. In the middle part of the race, Brad Malcuit, Cody Scott and Larry Bellman were changing positions on each circuit while Mitch Caskey -- last week's winner -- was moving through the field. With two laps to go, Scott suffered a flat tire and dropped out. Caskey got past Bellman for fourth following Malcuit across the line, with Bellman taking fifth. Caskey started 15th and collected the Hard Charger Award. Matt Irey and Gentry posted heat wins and Will Thomas collected the $200 Quick Time Award.  
 Scott Peltz used the outside front row starting spot to lead the way for the opening four laps before giving way to Joel Watson, but his time out front lasted only one lap as Mansfield's Kyle Moore took over. Starting seventh, and with a bounty riding on his shoulders, Moore took the point coming out of turn two and never looked back for his third win at "Orrville's Historic Oval." He swept the night as he pocketed the $100 Quick Time Award and won his heat race. A caution with five laps to go gave Casey Fritz, who came on strong in the last half of the feature, a chance at Moore on the restart. But Moore used the high groove to pull away. Peltz finished third with DJ Cline and Steve Rex filling out the top five. Fritz and Nathan Loney also were heat winners.  
 Moore returned to victory lane in the McKenzie Concrete Super Stock feature. He started on the pole but early cautions kept the field bunched together, which gave Michael Amick a chance. Amick swiped the top spot away from Moore on lap five and stayed out front for the next four circuits. Moore later recaptured the lead and pulled away for his second win of the night. Amick cruised to a second-place finish as it was a dogfight for third place between John Wilson, Brandon Craver, Chase Alexander and Gary Hensel Jr. The quartet ultimately finished in that order. Don Rutt -- who was involved in a red flag incident with Mike McElravy in the feature -- Wilson and Moore topped the heat races. Brandon Morrow picked up the $100 Quick Time Award.  
 It was a rough and tumble feature for the JoyRide Transport feature that saw Steven Lester roll in turn one at the start of the race. Once the feature went green, it was a six-car battle for the lead between Chaz Dawson -- the leader for the first five laps -- Cory Staley, Doug Hensel, Jordan James, Dustin Bedlion and Colton St. John. James took the lead on a restart on lap six and the Loudonville driver stayed out front for his first win. Bedlion took second with Staly taking third, followed by Johnny Bruce Sr. and Dakota Graciani. Dawson, St. John and Hensel had problems late in the race. Ryan Carder won the last chance race for the second week in a row as Staley, Bedlion and Hensel scored the heat wins.  
 Racing action next Saturday will be the Buckeye Late Model Dirt week with the Hans and Don Gross Memorial and $3,000 going to the winner of the Malcuit Tavern Super Late Models. The Pine Tree Towing & Recovery Sprints, the McKenzie Concrete Super Stocks and the JoyRide Transport Mini Stocks are on the racing card as well. Gates open at 3 p.m. and racing starts at 7 p.m.

Sue Bird has seen a lot in her storied playing career in the WNBA, overseas and the Olympics. While nothing the 39-year-old Seattle Storm guard experienced has prepared her for life in the WNBA bubble, she is making the best of the situation.  
 The WNBA put all 12 of its teams at a single site -- the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida -- in hopes of playing the full 22-game season amid the coronavirus pandemic.  
 "The bubble is part summer camp, mixed in with the Olympic village, playing overseas and an AAU tournament with a little bit of college life thrown in," Bird said in a phone interview.  
 Two weeks into the experiment, players and coaches have been adjusting to their temporary homes.  
 "It's like overseas, but a little bit easier as far as access to things as you can order in and it's less isolating since you have so many of your friends around," Bird's teammate Breanna Stewart said. "In the end, getting here and seeing how everything has come to fruition, I know it's going to work, as long as everyone's smart and continues to be safe. We're trusting everyone that's here is going to be safe."  
 Stewart is living in a villa with some of her Storm teammates while Bird is staying at the hotel on site. Players were given the option of where they wanted to live.  
 The street where the villas are located -- a few minutes from the hotel -- has the feel of a sorority row.  
 Each team was given two golf carts and they are usually parked in front of the villas where the players or operations staff are staying. Atlanta glossed up its carts with the team's new logo on the front.  
 "You say hello to people and could bump into someone a few times a day from another squad," New York guard Sabrina Ionescu said. "It feels like the Nike Nationals AAU Tournament. You could be eating next to a team or hanging out at the pool with players that you're going to be playing against later that day."  
 While a few players voiced their concerns the first few days about the quality of food and accommodations, the league quickly addressed those issues.  
 With their quarantines concluded, players and staff now have a robust array of food options offered daily at the hotel. Or players can get groceries delivered and cook for themselves in the villas. The hotel is also where the league does its daily virus testing.  
 "Food has been great. Service has been great. People have had issues with their housing. but there is no protocol for this, and the league took care of it," Phoenix Mercury veteran Diana Taurasi said. "This is the first time anyone has done this. The WNBA has gone far and beyond what I thought would happen."  
 Even with the WNBA in the bubble, the virus is still on everyone's mind. Players wear masks unless they are eating. When they line up for food and testing, marks on the ground remind them to stand at least 6 feet apart.  
 People can hang out in the hotel lounge, which has tabled spread apart to maintain social distancing. The pool has become a popular spot during the day and at night.  
 Even with the leisure activities, many players spend their free time relaxing in their rooms.  
 "There is a lot of sitting in your room, FaceTime with your family," Taurasi said. "It's not ideal, but everyone's trying their best to make sure they we are comfortable mentally and physically."

CLEVELAND -- The infield is set. From first to third, the Indians have known for months who would be manning each spot.
   
 The only question remaining is the lineup configuration, although that, too, seems to be trending toward one straightforward answer.
   
 To get to the answers on the construction of the outfield and how the designated hitter spot will be used early in the season, the Indians are having to take the scenic route.
   
 Some new injuries, a few old injuries no longer being an issue and the oddness and suddenness of summer camp have again jumbled how the Indians might put together their roster for Opening Day when it comes to the many available candidates in the outfield.
   
 The Indians will open the season with a 30-man active roster, which adds some flexibility, though that number will drop to 28 after two weeks and two weeks later, it'll fall to 26 for the remainder of the season.
   
 Oscar Mercado has his spot, and Franmil Reyes' bat will be in the lineup every day. Perhaps the No. 1 question remains how much Reyes can play in the outfield. The shortened summer camp, combined with Reyes missing time twice, once due to caution with COVID-19 and another following an awkward slide into second base, hasn't offered many answers in that regard.
   
 Manager Terry Francona would like to have Reyes in the outfield defensively, but the frequency with which that can happen depends on the value it adds elsewhere in how the Indians can configure their lineup. With less than a week to Opening Day, it remains a question mark.
   
 "It's been harder, just because he missed three days getting tested, he missed another day and a half when he slid hard," Francona said via Zoom. "He has played the outfield a few times. My hope is that that trend can continue a little bit. I think it gives us a stronger lineup when we're able to run him out to either left or right at least some of the time."
   
 That leads to Domingo Santana, another offense-first, right-handed hitter. To get both in the lineup, one below-average defensive outfielder, at least based on previous work, will man a spot in the outfield. That, in turn, means someone else is on the bench. If both sluggers are swinging the bat well, giving a little on the defensive end is an easier choice.
   
 "I mean [Santana] is a guy with a track record that if he gets hot, he gets real hot," Francona said. "We're trying to figure out where he fits. We're trying to figure out where everybody fits."
   
 The picture gets only murkier from there. Delino DeShields would normally have a spot on the roster, but he's on the injured list after being delayed by a positive COVID-19 test and might not be ready by Friday. Jordan Luplow has been dealing with a sore back and has missed some time recently. Tyler Naquin and Bradley Zimmer, meanwhile, are healthy following the shutdown and have both swung the bat well, especially Zimmer.
   
 Daniel Johnson, too, has had a positive camp, but the health of the other lefties lessens any need for the Indians to rush Johnson. Naquin had a strong 2019 before tearing his ACL and Zimmer has looked much improved and healthy for the first time in multiple seasons. Greg Allen remains a candidate as a switch-hitter. Jake Bauers, meanwhile, has more of an undefined fit.
   
 "Jake's in a little bit of a peculiar spot," Francona said. "His best position is probably first base. We've got a guy that we think is an All-Star there. So we're trying to make that bat fit, possibly in left field, Where does it fit? Those are all questions that we're going to have to figure out. Regardless, we all feel like there's an everyday player in there and at some point, it's going to show."

MILFORD - Back in April, Sarah Enquist was laid off from her job at KO Sushi & Grill in Hopkinton - a business that is closed today as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Shortly afterward, she relapsed.
 "I felt like, 'OK, the world is ending, why not?'" said Enquist, 32, who has struggled with addiction since she was 14 or 15.
 "Right now it's really hard for people in recovery because of the isolation," she said. "There's a lot of people who have had years of recovery, and they're falling off. It's really important for us all to be together, because in recovery, you can't do it alone."
 It was support from others that helped Enquist, who served in the Army for six years fixing weapons, stay sober since her relapse. People she previously lived with at a halfway house reached out to her when they heard about it, and she received support from Lisa Trusas, a 911 dispatcher and recovery coach at Community Impact Inc. in Milford who had been looking out for Enquist before she stayed at the halfway house.
 Virtual meetings held by Community Impact, an organization that provides mental health support and services for those struggling with addiction or losing someone to it, has also helped Enquist feel less alone. But moving out of Milford in late May to live at a sober home in Worcester with about 20 other women means, at the very least, that she won't be physically alone.
 "If we're all quarantined, at least I'm surrounded by like-minded people," she said. "The easiest thing for an addict to do is to talk to another addict because some people just don't understand. We've all been there before. Someone who hasn't might not get it."
 She's been there since May 31. As of Saturday, Enquist is 74 days sober.
 Sitting at a picnic table in the parking lot of Community Impact on Saturday morning painting rocks with colorful words reading, "hope" and "breathe," Enquist said she hopes people who see the rocks feel less alone in a time where physical isolation can mean life or death. It can be one of the worst things for an addict to experience, she said.
 "I remembered something that a girl in recovery had told me: 'Hope stands for hold on, pain ends.' That's what got me back. That's why I made this rock," she said, showing a rock depicting a sunny day with clouds, and that same phrase.
 The event to paint these "recovery rocks" was the first one hosted by Community Impact for Chris' Corner to spread the message of recovery and addiction awareness. Chris' Corner, a new resource recovery center planned for downtown Milford, is named for Milford High graduate Christopher Swindell, who died of an overdose at age 29 on July 13, 2018.
    New Milford recovery center to be named for Chris Swindell  
 About 40 others joined Enquist in rock-painting on Saturday, with more than four dozen rocks dispersed throughout Milford over the weekend, including some at the soon-to-be Garden of Hope at Fino Field. On the back of every rock is the hashtag #RSNP, which refers to the "Regional Substance Navigation Program," where people can reach out to for help.
 For those struggling with addiction during the pandemic, Enquist recommends they seek help, whether it's moving into a supportive environment with others or sharing your struggle through a computer screen.
 "I think addicts and alcoholics are just a bunch of big empaths that feel all the weight of the whole world, and they can't handle it," she said. "I just wanted to be able to spread hope, because hope's the only thing that brought me back."
 As a result of the pandemic forcing people to reduce physical contact with one another, Community Impact has turned to telehealth, video conferencing and phone check-ins to make up for its usual face-to-face meetings. The number of people seeking help through those programs has spiked during the pandemic, jumping from 71 in April to 101 in June, said owner Amy Leone.
 But she's glad to see more people seeking help.
 This past week, she said the center reopened to help a few younger children who were struggling with telehealth, but the full return of everyone will be a slow and steady process. Despite striving to keep everyone safe, the reduced physical contact with others has affected many who are struggling with their addiction or someone else's, said Leone.
 "All of us know that if this was happening to us in our families, we wouldn't know what to do and we would need somebody like (the staff at Community Impact Inc.)," said Leone. "If (my son) was struggling with that disease, I would need somebody to help. Because I wouldn't know what to do."
 It's what Shannon Keaney did when her son Patrick started struggling with addiction after getting hurt playing lacrosse in college. He had been in and out of rehab, and wanted to recover after struggling for more than five years, said the Milford mother.
 When Patrick was 23, his parents found him a rehabilitation center to stay at for 11 months. He came home with a prescription for Vivitrol, an opioid- blocker to reduce his cravings.
 But insurance wouldn't cover its cost, said Keaney. Without insurance, one injection of Vivitrol costs about $1,400.
 Patrick's parents fought with the insurance company for months about it, until Patrick relapsed. On Feb. 18, 2017, Patrick died of a fentanyl overdose. He was 24.
 "I was his friend," said Keaney, calling him a "mama's boy."
 It's been three years since his death, and he's remained on Keaney's mind every day since. The social isolation brought on by the pandemic has heightened her feelings of loneliness, but said virtual meetings with Community Impact have helped her, along with an online support group she helps run called "Rise Up" that meets a few times a month.
 "Find a group," Keaney tells those who are struggling after losing a loved one to addiction and feel physically and emotionally isolated from the world. "Don't stay home and in bed. Get a support system - and they are out there."

Sidney Crosby was two months removed from lifting the Stanley Cup when he turned his attention to winning another championship.  
 It was early September 2016, and the Pittsburgh Penguins captain stepped on the ice in Ottawa for Canada's training camp ahead of the World Cup of Hockey. Players had gone four months since any game action when NHL camps opened July 13 and they started preparing to jump right into the Stanley Cup playoffs.  
 A lengthy, unscheduled break because of a pandemic is something new for all involved, but the World Cup experience of transitioning from time off directly into meaningful competition is something the more than 100 players left from that tournament can draw on during the NHL's restart. The lessons learned -- good and bad -- could determine who packs up early and who battles for hockey's storied trophy.  
 "It's very similar to that," Crosby said. "You kind of have a short, abbreviated training camp and then you're right into it. You've got to be ready, but you also have to understand that you've just got to get better with every game. It's just about getting momentum and getting better every day. Whether it's training camp or Game 1, you just have to have that mentality. I think everyone's had different experiences that can help them in this case, but it's definitely got that feeling of the sprint."  
 Teams get only two weeks of camp at home, then travel to Toronto or Edmonton for one exhibition game before competition gets going for real. Before that, players had a month of voluntary workout time, similar to a typical summer offseason.  
 Only this time, it's not a prelude to an 82-game season. Except for the top four teams in each conference that get round-robin tune-up play, the remaining 16 go directly into a five-game elimination round right away. No pressure, right?  
 "It didn't matter what you did all summer," said Winnipeg Jets captain Blake Wheeler, who played for the U.S. in 2016. "It was tough. And it's going to be tough in Edmonton. We go in there knowing that it's not going to be easy."  
 U.S. teammate Ryan McDonagh figures this training camp is a little easier because of the built-in familiarity. His Tampa Bay Lightning and the other 23 teams coming back had played roughly 70 games together before the season was halted in mid-March.  
 "It's not like you're really trying to jell with new teammates out of the blue," McDonagh said. "Guys know what their roles are on this team. It's not like they have to kind of figure out where they're supposed to be and what kind of player we're being asked to be, so we can really just focus on getting our skills where they want to be, getting our pace and letting everything take its course."  
 That winding course is something hockey's best players and coaches can recall from 2016. New York Islanders coach Barry Trotz, who was an assistant when Canada won the World Cup, considers that tournament the closest comparison because he anticipates the same frantic shifts of momentum.  
 "You can recover real quick too: You can have an off game there, and your game can get right back on track the next game," Trotz said. "It's a short window. We've got to (be ready) right from the drop of the puck from the opening faceoff."  
 When the U.S. wasn't ready, it went 0-3 and out. The same result for any team this time around would mean a qualifying round sweep and no hockey again until December, at the earliest.  
 "The experience I really take out of it is to crank the intensity up earlier and try to get into it as much as you can," said Dallas Stars forward Joe Pavelski, who served as U.S captain in 2016. "You have to stay committed to playing playoff-type hockey in 2-1, 3-2 games and (avoid) turnovers. It'll be important to get in that mindset early."  
 Playing in empty arenas will take an entirely different mindset, though the feel around the cities should be similar for players. They'll be able to keep tabs on the other action while they're together in a couple of hotels, quarantined from the general public until there's a new champion.  
 "You're in that hotel and it's pretty much just rink to hotel and back and forth," McDonagh said. "You're going to be watching other games, seeing who makes it out of the first round and how teams are shaking out and all that stuff. It'll have that feel. It's not quite there yet."

El exentrenador de la selección española de balonmano, Valero Rivera, que este mismo lunes anunció su salida del equipo para marcharse a otra federación, ha destacado las virtudes del exjugador Iñaki Urdangarín, quien podría acompañarle en su próxima aventura como técnico. Rivera no ha querido confirmar nada por el momento, pero no ha dudado en señalar las cualidades del marido de la infanta Cristina como jugador de este deporte. "Ha sido jugador de la selección durante quince años, era un gran defensor y facilitaba mucho en las labores de ataque. Psicológicamente es una persona muy fuerte. Es de esos jugadores afortunados, llegó muy joven al club y se retiró ahí", ha afirmado el técnico durante el Foro 'Camino a 2020', organizado por el Comité Olímpico Español (COE). El entrenador aragonés, que no ha querido dar demasiadas pistas sobre su destino y sobre su relación con Urdangarín, ha asegurado que ya explicará los detalles cuando llegue el momento. "Hoy acaba mi contrato y tenía pensado decir adiós, dar mi agradecimiento a todas las personas. Estoy aquí porque me comprometí con Alejandro Blanco (presidente del COE) y, después de todo lo que se ha dicho, me remito a la carta. Es el día de decir adiós, cuando toque lo que toque, hablaré", ha zanjado Rivera. Al margen de su reciente despedida de la selección, Valero Rivera, que durante el acto se mostró convencido de que "el futuro del balonmano está garantizado", ha recordado la emoción que le supuso levantar el título que convirtió al equipo en Campeón del Mundo. "Fue como el final de una película maravillosa, el día más feliz de mi vida, en la ciudad donde siempre he vivido, con mi familia del Palau", concluyó.

At the beginning of summer the North Hastings Community Cupboard started two new projects with the help of the Community Food Centres Canada Grant. Now they are starting to see the fruits of their labour, and adding them to their programs.   With help from the $20,000 funding the NHCC was able to purchase seven garden towers and build several produce boxes. The goal of these boxes and towers is to bring fresh fruits and vegetables to their food baskets, the soup kitchen, and to develop more healthy eating programs.   With the help of the towers in a greenhouse, NHCC volunteer Amanda Stone is hoping they can provide fresh food all year round to community members. With grow lights that attach to the towers, they will be able to grow plants even in the short, cold days of winter.   The seven towers give the NHCC the ability to grow 196 plants. Currently, they are working on lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, beans and some herbs. “We tried to pick some simple things that people will actually use. There are a lot of options for what we can grow in a tower, but for now we are going to stick with the popular items for now.”   The volunteers working in the garden towers are going through a learning curve. Gardening in a tower indoors can be a bit different then working in a traditional garden bed. For example the towers do not use soil, can water themselves and they don’t need to be weeded. But since the towers are in the green house, volunteers will have to pollinate plants themselves.   The goal with these towers is for the NHCC to become more self-sustaining. Not only as a way to supply fresh produce for their shelves but as a way to raise funds for future programs.   Stone is looking to the future when the garden towers may allow the NHCC to set up something similar to a farmer’s market. This would enable the volunteers to raise funding for the Cupboard while providing fresh local food for area residents.   Currently with COVID-19, there is more funding available for programs and organizations like the NHCC, but that is not always the case. At times it can be difficult for organizations to get the funding needed to run programs.   “Knowing that we can do some social enterprise work with it [the tower garden] going forward is knowing we can keep our charity status going. Because there is obviously a need, but it does take money to run it.” explains Stone.   Stone hopes that once they are up and running well enough that the NHCC could also provide produce to local restaurants. The funds raised from those sales would help to directly sustain the work the NHCC does in the community.   This project could take time to develop as the greenhouse, garden towners and garden beds will need to be expanded. There is another grant available through Canada Agriculture and the NHCC is currently looking into the possibilities of applying.   “It would be so cool, I think, to be able to buy fresh grown local produce all year long. With all our little cafes and stuff, it would really help our local economy too, as opposed to having to order from out of town. It could be real sustainable.”   In the meantime, Stone and other volunteers are using the food baskets and fresh vegetables from the gardens to help others learn about healthy eating. This is done through the development of healthy recipes that are written out by the volunteers, and placed on cards that are included in the food baskets. These can be used by those who receive the baskets again and again, offering the opportunity to learn how to make nutritious meals for less.   The NHCC is always looking for new ways to help the community, and with many people believing that COVID-19 will have an effect on food pricing and availability, the volunteers want to let people know that their services are available to everyone. “We are not just a food bank, we are much more than that,” says Stone.   They are also looking for more help from area volunteers. Anyone interested in gardening, food, nutrition and more can find the volunteers working on the NHCC gardens every Monday.

A local seventh-grader got an early taste of the college experience after taking the ACT test and enrolling in an online university course.
   
 At 12 years old, Collin M. Clement of Chackbay took the college entrance exam in December and was accepted into Mary Baldwin University's online program in Virginia.
   
 The Sixth Ward Middle School student is now taking a college-credited psychology course online.
   
 "He's on discussion boards with older students and is pretty pumped about it," Collin's mother, Paula Clement, said. "We're really proud of him. It's just exciting to see him pumped about college at this young age."
   
 As soon as Collin is able to take college courses in Louisiana, he will apply to Nicholls State University or Louisiana State University, Clement said. The youngster plans to take two college courses each year until he graduates from high school.
   
 He hopes to take a sociology class during next spring, Clement said.
   
 Collin said he has developed a regimen that balances both study and downtime. He said gaming and playing basketball and soccer help alleviate stress.
   
 "Every week you do an essay and take multiple tests," the future eighth-grader said. "It's not that bad. I just study a lot. I feel like doing multiple classes right now would be stressful."
   
 When he isn't hitting the books, Collin is involved with numerous extracurricular activities, including robotics, 4-H and playing the drums for the Sixth Ward Middle School band.
   
 His mom said Collin is surrounded by influential role models. Both of his older brothers, Matthew and Jacob Carpenter, have already graduated from college. The former is a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and the latter is a safety analyst for LSU.
   
 Collin's father, Shannon Clement, serves as the human resources director for the Assumption Parish School Board and Paula Clement is the assistant principal at W.S. Lafargue Elementary School in Thibodaux.
   
 His younger sister, Andi Clement, is an accomplished swimmer who has won multiple awards.
   
 "He's got really good role models behind him," Paula Clement said.
   
 Collin's best advice for those preparing to take the ACT is to take it more than once to get a feel for the exam.
   
 "At first it's a bit stressful, but if you take it over and over as you go it gets easier because you realize what to do and how to do it," he said. "Be confident and make sure you study and look ahead. I also suggest getting a tutor and work on your time management. Timing is very important."
   
 Collin said he hopes to one day become a neurosurgeon.
   
 "I like helping people, and I'm not super squeamish," he said.
