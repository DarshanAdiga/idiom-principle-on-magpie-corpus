The parents of four DuPage County high school athletes have filed a lawsuit, hoping to force the return of football and other sports that have been postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying the Illinois High School Association violated its bylaws when it agreed to follow the state's safety guidelines.
   
 The suit, filed on behalf of a basketball player, two football players and a competitive dancer, says the IHSA failed to follow its procedures when it "adopted as binding guidelines on IHSA schools several non-binding guidelines issued by (Gov. J.B.) Pritzker regarding the conduct and timing of interscholastic athletics for its member schools."
   
 The Pritzker administration in July issued rules categorizing youth and high school sports at various levels of risk. Football, wrestling and competitive dance were listed as high-risk sports, meaning athletes can practice if there is no contact, but cannot compete. Basketball, categorized as medium risk, can have players scrimmage but not play games.
   
 The IHSA, already facing a similar lawsuit in Montgomery County, near St. Louis, said it would defer to state officials about returning to play, and moved football, boys soccer and girls volleyball to the spring. But as other states have restarted those sports, the IHSA has sought unsuccessfully to regain authority over its schedule.
