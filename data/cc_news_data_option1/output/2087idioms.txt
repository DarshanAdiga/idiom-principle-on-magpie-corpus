“What if we made a narrative that comes just from spying on somebody you don’t know while they’re going through something? We wanted it to be about quarantine without being about it,” Anderson says. “Nobody wants to talk about quarantine in artwork right now, but there are these very universal emotions within it that correspond with other life changes. We realized we could be in that world without talking about COVID.”
 The game began by introducing us to the Instagram account of Jade, a self- described “humanoid” with a penchant for bad poetry and metaphorical dreams. We meet Jade in a moment of vulnerability. Robin, Jade told us in an an Instagram video on May 5, has left her for the Pacific Northwest. The relationship between Jade and Robin isn’t spelled out at first, but we see early on that Jade is hurting, and the intimacy of a selfie as well as the casual, improvisational delivery of actress Nerea Duhart, is designed to foster an immediate connection.
 Jade is a character who, in a time of quarantine, is reeling from the dissolution of a relationship and asking for friends. Or, players rather. Tommy Honton, an escape-room veteran and co-founder of the Museum of Selfies, art-directed the puzzles, some of which are twists on Picross brainteasers, and others that have players stringing together abstract images.
 While some will have players using free web tools to distort images or sound files, by centering the game on Instagram it ultimately feels more like a four-week horror film told in installments rather than a series of puzzles. “Arcana” doesn’t try to mold an existing format onto the mobile phones; it recognizes the inherent forward momentum of smartphone-based media.

In fact, the series’ thorny relationship with celebrity is _one of its central features_ : While “Terrace House” was a boon to professional snowboarder Takayuki Nakamura, whose clothing brand received international attention after he wore it on the show, basketball player Ryo Tawatari found himself in hot water when fans theorized he cut short an in-house romance to placate his admirers.
 Unfortunately, the abuse that may accompany a star’s rise to prominence is often treated as par for the course — the trade you make in return for notoriety. “Terrace House” alumni began sharing their own experiences with the phenomenon after Kimura’s death. “I was often told ‘that’s the price of being on television,’ ‘if you’re going to get hurt, don’t be on it,’ ‘die,’ ‘leave,’ ” Mizukoshi wrote.
 That price is a lot to ask, even of someone who’s signed away their privacy for the sake of our enjoyment.
 “I’m just an athlete, not an entertainer,” Tawatari wrote in his _online tribute to Kimura_. For those who enter the house with even less experience in the public eye, the transition may be even more difficult.

"Nobody knows how many people have died. It could be 50 or even more," recalls Khadiza Begum.
 The 50-year-old was among 396 Rohingya Muslims who had tried to reach Malaysia but who finally returned to the Bangladeshi shore after the boat carrying them was stranded at sea for two months.
 Her estimate on the number of deaths comes from the funerals her son officiated as an imam, a Muslim preacher, on the same boat.
 The human smugglers never delivered them to their longed-for destination.
 Khadiza had to run away from her home in Myanmar because of violence that UN investigators described as a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing".

Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley spent the last two decades working with local officials to attract independent restaurants to the borough, turning it into South Jersey's top dining destination.
   
 Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the tree-lined town packed more than 30 restaurants into 1.9 square miles, including some Philly offshoots (Sabrina's Cafe, Circle Thai) and some rivaling the city's top offerings (Hearthside, Zeppoli).
   
 When Gov. Phil Murphy banned dining in restaurants in March in response to the pandemic, the borough quickly created drive-up zones for customers to safely grab curbside takeout -- and many restaurants adapted.
   
 But as New Jersey begins to re-emerge from its months-long lockdown, the question becomes -- what's next for South Jersey restaurants?
   
 'Like a tsunami'
   
 Once the ban on dining in restaurants is lifted, it will not be a return to normal, Maley says. Rather, restaurant owners, hospitality workers and customers must navigate a new "abnormal'' focused on safety, while restaurants try to recover from months of limited or no income, furloughed staff, supply chain issues and frustration over a lack of government relief funds.
   
 The shutdown of restaurants and scramble to recalibrate as they reopen "is like a tsunami unlike any we've ever seen,'' Maley said. "It's going to change everything about the way restaurants do business.''
   
 "I think there are two steps in this process,'' the mayor continued, based on conversations he's having regularly with officials throughout the state, "when the rules change, and when people decide that it's OK to go."
   
 He used an analogy to illustrate that wanting to go and going are not the same thing.
   
 "Golf is my life and they changed the rules on that, but (my wife and I) have both been like, 'Uh, not yet.' There might be some landmines when you go out there first.''
   
 The biggest change will be the number of seats restaurants are permitted to fill at one time. With capacity reduced by 50 percent or more, the question becomes, what else can be done to make up that income? Since Collingswood is filled with BYOBs, extending liquor licenses to allow for pre-packaged cocktails or other drink incentives will not help balance the books as it might in other towns, he said.
   
 The answer will need to come from feeding more hungry diners. In addition to increasing outdoor seating in areas approved for such purposes such as patios, guests may also see tables set up on sidewalks, side streets, main corridors like Haddon Avenue or even adjoining properties like empty parking lots.
   
 Collingswood officials are weighing the possibility of closing Haddon Avenue to traffic for select times this summer (such as weekend evenings) to allow restaurants to set up tables throughout the town, a model that's been tested during the borough's summer Arts Fest & Night Market.
   
 "I don't think for a while, as the faucet slowly opens, that we are going to have an avalanche of people,'' Maley said, a prediction echoed by restaurant owners themselves.
   
 What are the rules?
   
 Chef Anthony Iannone, left, and Chef John Pilarz are co-owners of Anthony's Creative Italian Cuisine in Haddon Heights. They are shown here prior to the pandemic shut down restaurants for dine-in service.
   
 Craig Kunisch, co-owner of two North Jersey restaurants and former president of the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association, is readying his businesses for an announcement that the state's 25,000 full-service restaurants have the green light to reopen. Some experts have predicted 10 percent of the state's eateries never will, and some say that percentage is even higher.
   
 As the governor weighs when to let restaurants seat their first post-lockdown guests, the restaurant association has released the following guidelines:
   
 Tables, chairs and bars to be cleaned and sanitized after every use.
   
 Place settings, utensils and menus to become either single-use or sanitized after every use.
   
 All staff must be certified in safe food handling (currently it's one member per shift).
   
 "Guest-facing" staff (primarily servers) wear masks.
   
 Employees have temperature checks and sick employees can't come to work.
   
 Anthony Iannone is co-owner of Anthony's Creative Italian Cuisine in Haddon Heights, which celebrates its 40th year in business in June. Iannone is also president of South Jersey Hot Chefs, an organization that represents nearly 20 local independent restaurants impacted by the crisis.
   
 He stresses that those revamping their menus must stay focused on what diners want right now. For instance, his restaurant went back to its roots, creating a takeout menu that draws heavily on basic Italian comfort food created from what is readily available and can be offered at a lower price point. He says he will likely retain this model, at least in part, once he can set his tables for dinner again.
   
 Restaurants focusing on takeout will likely need to retain that revenue stream, he said, which will present a challenge in a busy kitchen also gearing up for dinner guests.
   
 As far as reopening, "I am a little nervous moving forward … We know what things look like in terms of the known (masks, social distancing etc.), but what's the unknown going to be? If we are only able to open at 50 percent capacity, we are fortunate. We have three dining rooms, we have the physical ability to do that. But what about our employees? Will they feel comfortable coming back into that environment?''
   
 There also are practical considerations to work out in busy kitchens, where it will prove challenging to keep staff interacting at a safe distance, Iannone said. And then there are new costs restaurants would need to absorb for masks and gloves, disposable menus, one-serving condiments and additional sanitizing supplies.
   
 "I know people are looking forward to getting out and socially interacting,'' Iannone said. "I know people are itching to come out, but what would it look like?''
   
 Weighing the options
   
 In other parts of the country and the world where restaurants have resumed business, there is evidence that creativity and experimentation will be called for to adapt and thrive.
   
 In Amsterdam, for instance, small greenhouses are being employed to shelter outdoor diners in small groups, away from other diners and passersby. Service is provided at a distance, with masked waitstaff bringing food to the table on long planks.
   
 In Ocean City, Maryland, a bar had individual outdoor seats manufactured that resemble inner tubes, so guests tempted to invade each other's space will bounce off each other like bumper cars on the boardwalk.
   
 In some Asian countries, restaurant booths are cordoned off with Plexiglas and sanitized between guests, a model likely to be replicated by some New Jersey restaurants. But such accommodations are not practical for so many smaller, mom-and-pop businesses.
   
 Christine Chamoun, who, with chef/husband Dory Chamoun owns Dory's Mediterranean Grill in Medford, sees a quiet relaunch once they are given the green light to seat guests. And she does not foresee seating them inside her small cafe for quite some time.
   
 Instead, she plans to seat guests outside and work with the landlord and neighboring Iron Stone Village strip mall tenants to serve additional guests as weather permits.
   
 Takeout will remain an important part of the business going forward, she says. "This is not a problem that's going to kill our business. There are many people who are trying us out now who have never eaten inside.''
   
 Finding the silver lining
   
 Back in Collingswood, Maley sees a silver lining in the commitment shown by local residents to adapt to curbside pickup and do what they can to keep small businesses afloat.
   
 He points to the growing popularity of restaurant meal kits - build-your-own options for burgers, tacos, pizza and more - being offered by diners, cafes and even some high-end restaurants - as a pandemic trend that could also stick around.
   
 "The half 'do-it-yourself-at-home' may prove to be a separate revenue stream,'' he said.
   
 "I do believe the part of our restaurant scene that's grown, it's taken off since after 9/11. And that was because … there was more of a movement to be home, to stay close to home. I think that's where the fancy, schmancy restaurants had a little decline, and people kind of got back into more hometown stuff. And I think this is going to have that kind of an impact, it's going to roll people a lot closer to home.
   
 "It worries me,'' the mayor continued, "because restaurants have become our anchor store at the mall. It worries me,'' Maley concluded, "but we'll figure it out. We limped along and we will get through it.''
   
 Amidst all the uncertainty, one thing is clear - whatever form the reboot of restaurants takes, it will require patience, cooperation and trust between owners and those they serve.

"All the factors made us concerned that this was going to be a scenario that we saw, and the numbers kind of verified that," Yazel said.
 Over the past four to five weeks, Jeffersonville Fire Sgt. Justin Ames has noticed an increase in calls involving unresponsive individuals, and as a result, there has been increased use of naloxone in case the individual is experiencing an overdose.
 "There's a slight spike now, but it doesn’t compare to the amount of calls we were getting a couple years ago," he said.
 Clarksville Fire Chief Brandon Skaggs said there seems to be more calls related to opioid overdoses over the past month.
 "I think so many things have been focused on the COVID-19 response that other areas are not overlooked necessarily, but many are not looked upon as closely," he said. "As far as the mental health aspect of the pandemic, I don't know if it's affecting people who use opioids in a different way, but it's definitely an issue. Maybe there is some connection there, but I'm not sure."
 Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing guidelines, it can be more difficult to address ongoing issues such as addiction, according to Yazel.
 "First and foremost, we just need to, as soon as we can, consider these recovery services essential services, which they are and get as much as we can back up and running," he said. "I do think what we have in place worked, it's just a matter of their extenuating circumstances that we couldn't do it to their full potential."
 Gov. Eric Holcomb and the FSSA recently announced the state will fund almost $1 million for distribution of naloxone. The nonprofit Overdose Lifeline, Inc. will distribute 25,000 doses of naloxone to those likely to be first on the scene of an overdose, including first responders, families and caregivers.
 Requests for the naloxone are available at www.overdoselifeline.org/2020-indiana-naloxone-request.
 Yazel is encouraged to see the state's support for increased naloxone distribution. The health department replenished its supply last week, and there should be access to additional naloxone if needed, he said.
 "That's always been a thing of [the health department] – we want to make sure that anybody who needs it has the low barrier ability to get trained and to administer it," he said.

Developing for a new console is hard but the newer consoles are not as hard due to their similarities to PC hardware. But Optimizing is easy because all the consoles have the exact same hardware, drivers and software so there is no variations to work on. Later on down the road though ti becomes even easier to develop for them since they get a lot of exclusives from the big game companies. I do think though that the XB1 and Windows 10 will make it easier for consoles than ever.

Likening the coronavirus era to a horror story is no great leap. An invisible, deadly killer, angry mobs, supply shortages, financial bedlam — even those lucky enough to survive this moment relatively unscathed can no doubt sense it is one of high tension and drama.
 So maybe the escape we’ve all been needing was a narrative game that uses popular social media tools to recall one of the most gruesome murders to occur within Los Angeles city limits, a horror so great that it became national news, inspired a folk song and specifics of which, involving the harming of a child at the hands of a teenager, are chilling to read. While not many today remember the details of the tragic fate that befell a young Marion Parker in 1927, this paper has stated that few crimes “have been more revolting.”
 Wait. No. That’s not the feel-good story this moment is lacking, It is, however, the one “Arcana” has given us.
 Recognizing that many feel the world is currently out of sorts, as well as the damage one’s own mind can do when left alone, “Arcana” is certainly not trying to be “Animal Crossing,” Yet over the last three weeks the game, largely constructed in the days after stay-at-home initiatives went into place, has populated a not-so-hidden corner of Instagram with a tale of murder and mystery while also hitting on the terrors of isolation, all the while cleverly using the social media platform as a playing field.

I think they're enjoying the lockdown and the fact that they've been able to take a bit of a breather. It's been a very, very busy year for them, and I think this is a moment to just take a breath, reflect, and I think that's what they'll be doing on their anniversary."

Instagram @drjashton. May is mental health awareness month and this year it may be more important than ever to recognize its value. Joining me now to weigh in on this topic is motivational speaker and author bershan Shaw. Thank you for talking with us today. I know in a world operating with school closures and stay-at-home orders and social distancing, talk about the affects those changes have for sure on people's state of mental health. Hello, yes. This quarantine has really gotten to people. I mean, social distancing, people are becoming very depressed. They're becoming sad. They're becoming angry. It really does affect you because as human beings, we like to connect with people. We like to hug and kiss and say hello, so it's causing a really big effect. That's right, and people are literally, not just figuratively, isolated right now, so what are your top three tips on helping people get that stronger mental health and to get something into their daily life and routine that will make them feel better? Yes, and this is what I love doing. Number one, join a support group or talk to friends. Join someplace where you can be involved with people. That's why I have you are a warrior, right, my app. Then, next I love exercising. Exercising every day to get your endorphins up. I don't care if you walk around your neighborhood, walk up the steps, do some type of exercising to get things out of your mind. And then I really love dancing. Put on your favorite music and just dance. I mean, sometimes you got to look crazy, but dance on your own just so you can feel good and get out of this rut because we're all going through it. I agree. I try to have at least one dance party a week and it takes all my worries away. Now, you mentioned your app. If people want to take things a step further, you have this new app that helps people who are looking for support in their mental health journey, so what makes your platform different from those that are already out there? Yeah, you know, my platform is a safe space. We don't have to be like someone else. You know, a lot of these platforms you have to dress up, you can't make a mistake, you have to look beautiful. We want a place where you can be you. No need to be validated by anyone. If you're depressed, come on an share your story. If you're feeling anxious, stressed, feeling lonely, I mean, look at the unemployment rate today. It's the highest in so long, so you can talk about that. Other places you have to make it seem like you're okay and make it seem like you don't have any problems when you have problems. That's what we're about, to share your story because I have problems. We all have problems. I was just going to ask you that because you are just radiating positivity but clearly you chose this in terms of becoming a motivational speaker and helping people who have mental health needs. What brought you to this line of work? You know, I'm a stage four breast cancer survivor. I was given three months to live, three months, and that really -- it plays on your mind and your psyche. But I'm here, thank god, 12 years later, so I wanted to do this to give back because I know people are suffering in silence. I coach them. I coach leaders and business owners and CEOs and middle management and entrepreneurs. We're suffering in silence. We need a place where we can share and talk about what we're going through and not make it seem like we're living this happy day every single day. We need a place. I know I needed a place when I was going through cancer so I know other people need a place. Believe me, they do. They tell me. Thank you for sharing that too by the way. I got chills from head to toe hearing you say that because I have to say, I've never met a happier group of people than people who have faced death or have felt that fear because they realize how important it is to live. So as we close out this month of may this week, hoping you can leave us with a message of hope and motivation for those who are watching and may need to hear what you have to say. I have to tell them, this too shall pass. Keep going. I'm telling you, I'm giving urawarrior.com, the letter u-r-a warrior.com. 5,000 perks, great themes, motivational bracelets, motivational books, things that can help you get through this. We have to keep going because this too shall pass. My biggest thing, never ever give up. I love that. And you know what, from this breast cancer survivor to you, I knew we were sisters. Bershan Shaw, thank you for being with us today. We appreciate it. Thank you so much. I'm glad to be here. Not going to be able to wipe the smile off my face.

Days later, off the coast of Thailand, a small boat arranged by the human traffickers brought in much needed supplies.
 But, while they were waiting for another chance to get to Malaysia, the Burmese navy intercepted them.
 "They arrested the captain and three crew members, but they were released," Khadiza says. "I guess they made some sort of a deal."
 Their second and last attempt to land in Malaysia was also to end in failure. It became clear to everyone on the boat that they were going nowhere.
 "We were drifting around in the sea, with no hope of ever reaching the shore. People were getting desperate. We kept asking ourselves how long we could survive like this."
 So, a group of refugees went up to the crew and pleaded with them to disembark anywhere, regardless of whether it was Myanmar or Bangladesh.
 But the crew refused, believing it too risky. They could be arrested and their boat taken away.
 As the boat drifted aimlessly in Bay of Bengal, stories accusing the crew of rape and torture started circulating.
 "Things were getting out of control," Khadiza says. "I heard one of the crew members was attacked and killed - his body dumped in the sea."
 There were 10 Burmese crew members overseeing almost 400 refugees. "They realised it would be very difficult for them to fight and win," she says.
 The crew demanded more money to hire small boats which would take them ashore. Those on board coughed up another $1,200.
 After a few days, a small boat approached them. Immediately, the captain and most of the crew members jumped in to run away.
 Those remaining managed to steer the boat towards Bangladesh, with the help of two remaining crew members.

First off, kudos to the powercolor team for managing to fit both on the same pcb with the amount of cooling they did on a single gpu card. That's some serious skill. Although why, why the 2 hottest gpu's on the planet (or nearly)? Hmm, if only there was a dual am3+ board so I could pair it with a duo of fx 9590's. Then I could game away and not even have to fire up the furnace this winter lol.

 Where “Arcana” is going is defined, and newcomers can easily get caught up via summaries on the game’s site or simply by spending a little time with Jade’s Instagram. In terms of play, there are day-to-day moments that are malleable.
 “The weekly structure, overall plot and assets are something we decide ahead of time and is scripted, scheduled and planned thoroughly,” says Mali Elfman, co-founder of the short-film platform Fun Size Horror, and producer of the project. “Once the game is live, though, we know we’re have to change, tweak, create breadcrumbs toward things missed or needed.

There's a big difference between outsourcing to help delegate specialty work and outsourcing to cut corners. Clearly, this is a case of the latter. The pc version was obviously considered low priority, the work to port it was contracted out way too late in the development cycle, and the port was released even though the company knew that these game-breaking bugs existed.
