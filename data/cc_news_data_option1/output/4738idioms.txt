BOSTON (AP) — The Massachusetts Senate has approved its version of a $46 billion proposed state budget, about a 5.5% increase over the prior fiscal year. The spending plan, approved Wednesday evening, aims to move the state towards a more equitable recovery from the pandemic by making key investments in early education and childcare, food security, housing supports, and public health, Senate leaders said. The budget is for the fiscal year that began back on July 1. The state has been relying on temporary budgets to keep the state government up and running. Action on the budget was delayed by the onset of the coronavirus in the spring. Typically the new state budget is approved by lawmakers and signed by the governor by the start of the new fiscal year. The House has already approved its version of the budget. Both versions now head to a six-member conference committee made up of House and Senate members to hammer out a final compromise budget plan that must come back to each chamber for an up or down vote before being delivered to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker's desk. Baker will have 10 days to review the spending plan before issuing any vetoes and signing it. Baker and lawmakers will have little time to catch their breath before having to turn around and begin drafting a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2021. During the debate, the Senate adopted an amendment that would require the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to make a reasonable effort to use any new influx of federal aid to restore any planned service cuts that have hurt ridership, which has plummeted during the pandemic. Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack has suggested it might make more sense to hold off on using any additional federal dollars until they need it as...

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Two women who were slain in Miami in the 1970s were murdered by the United States' deadliest serial killer, authorities said. In a memo written by an assistant state attorney in Miami- Dade County on Thursday, Karen O’Donoghue, whose body has never been found, and Dorothy Gibson, who was strangled outside a downtown Miami hotel in 1977, were killed by Samuel Little, who has confessed to more than 90 killings. Little, who is 80, is in prison in California and serving multiple life sentences. He won't be charged in the two Miami murders, the memo stated. He’s been behind bars since 2012, and in 2018, told investigators he was responsible for about 90 killings nationwide between 1970 and 2005. The FBI said its crime analysts believe all of his confessions are credible. Miami Dade Chief Assistant State Attorney Kathleen Hoague wrote in a memo that the O’Donoghue and Gibson cases were being cleared as the “appropriate disposition for us and to give the next of kin closure” after so many years. Little said he strangled his 93 victims, nearly all of them women. Some of his victims were on the margins of society. Many were originally deemed overdoses, or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes. Some bodies were never found. Little told investigators he met O'Donoghue outside of a home for the mentally ill in the early 1970s. Little knew certain details about O'Donoghue — including that she had been a nurse and that she had menstrual irregularities. The FBI provided 30 drawings of some of his victims — color portraits that were drawn by Little himself in prison. Among them was a drawing of Gibson, who Little described as “girl at the bus stop hotel in back Linda.” “The composite sketch done by Inmate Little also was similar to the known photographs of Dorothy...

Proponents of the statue remaining in place have attempted to rewrite history to conform to their idyllic fantasies of the Confederacy.

This disturbing truth resounds in the words of Vice President of the Confederacy Alexander Stephens in his “Cornerstone” speech: “Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Although the Islamic State extremist group is battered and scattered, it cannot be fully defeated until the world finds a way to reconcile and resettle the thousands of people displaced by years of war in Iraq and Syria, the general overseeing American military operations in the Mideast said Thursday. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command, said there is no military means of solving the problem of Mideast refugees and internally displaced persons, or IDPs, who await repatriation or resettlement and represent what he called an unfortunate byproduct of armed conflicts. “Today, across vast swaths of Syria and Iraq, the systemic indoctrination of IDP and refugee camp populations who are hostage to the receipt of ISIS ideology is an alarming development with potentially generational implications,” McKenzie said in remarks to the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations. He said a solution must come from a joint effort by diplomatic, security and humanitarian organizations. “Unless the international community finds a way to repatriate, reintegrate into home communities, and support locally grown reconciliation programming of these people, ... we are buying ourselves a strategic problem 10 years down the road when these children grow up radicalized. If we don't address this now, we're never really going to defeat ISIS,” he added. Over the past six years, starting with former President Barack Obama's decision in 2014 to return U.S. troops to Iraq to halt an advance of Islamic State forces into Iraq from Syria, the U.S. has led an effort to militarily defeat the extremist group in both countries. But the group has not been extinguished, and McKenzie said it has not abandoned its aspiration to recreate a caliphate and attack the West. President Donald Trump has pushed for a...

He later recognised the mystery lady in a very old photograph of former staff at the castle - and she would have died long before his encounter on the castle roof.
 And his friend Steve, a security guard, once heard someone coming down the kitchen steps and felt someone breathing on the back of his neck.
 There appears to be at least one extra camp mate joining the celebs this year as a ghostly figure was reportedly seen at a window of Gwrych Castle during the launch night.
 An employee of the attraction told a national title that they had seen a floating woman in white and ghost hunters had felt her presence.
 "Several of the crew are completely horror-stricken and don’t want to go up to the castle," they claimed.
 "There are lots of lights on the main sets but there are also many dark areas behind the scenes and some noises are extremely spooky.
 "Even staff who don’t believe in that sort of thing are reluctant to go up to some of parts that were supposed to be used for running equipment and camera positions."
 Gemma Williams, a paranormal investigator, told another national title that she was "chased by a glowing woman wearing a red dress" during an overnight stay.
 "My friends and I stood there in absolute shock looking at her," she explained.
 "She had an old fashioned red dress on, a white shawl going over her arms and curly blonde hair.
 "We heard an almighty scream from her, it was really, really loud, which made us run again, it broke the trance. We ran down the front of the castle at full pelt.
 "We all got to the bottom and said one by one that we had seen a lady in a red dress. There was no explanation for it at all."
 Are all these people mistaken or is the castle really being haunted?

We now turn to present-day Warren County to address the false notion that racism, like slavery, is a relic of our past. Take, for example, the case of former Warren-Page NAACP President Suetta Freeman who, even after surmounting being locked out of schooling by Massive Resistance at Warren County High in 1958, went on to graduate here and embark on a career in auditing, yet had to commute for decades to Northern Virginia because she was unable to secure fair and equal employment in Front Royal. Her experience illustrates the racial inequality that is endemic nationally: on average, Black people only make 62 percent of white people’s salary. Or this year, when a truck drove past the home of a prominent member of our Black community and its driver shouted, “White power!” Or this summer, when a mixed-race child accidentally dropped a hand wipe at Applebee’s and her mother found it returned to their car with the writing, “You asked for this wipe, then left it laying (sic) right where that little peckerhead half-breed dropped it so everyone else could step on it. Though I’m sure your home is filthy and cluttered, we try to keep our town clean.” Or the people of color who visited our town for a work retreat in 2017 and awoke to an effigy of a lynching in their rental’s yard. Or the possibility that if we don’t take action to address injustice now, a name like George Floyd’s could someday be ringing from our own Blue Ridge Mountains.

M​: It was a great challenge. 8 months into the pandemic we knew that a show put together on Zoom wouldn't make the cut. It was enough time to plan accordingly and not scramble things together. Some of the shows were filmed in house. For those that we managed directly we ordered specific equipment to support the exigencies of each respective production. For instance we have ordered a 40metre green screen and green dance carpet flooring from the UK for specific shows. Consequently we now own the biggest green screen on the island. We turned Valletta Campus Theatre into a studio for two weeks in September and filmed a series of shows back to back. The execution of other shows was managed independently by their respective creatives because people within those teams had ample film production experience themselves. We had to rethink the creative process and work cinematically. We brought a Director of Photography on board to oversee the whole festival so we'd have cohesion in our aesthetic.
