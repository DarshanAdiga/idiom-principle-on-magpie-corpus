" _Space Force_ came around in a rather atypical way. Netflix had this premise that they thought might make a funny show -- the idea made everybody laugh in a meeting, an idea of a show about the origins of a fictitious Space Force. I heard about the idea through my agent, and Netflix pitched the show to me, and then I pitched the show to Greg, and we all had the same reaction to it," Carell explained in statements released by Netflix. There was no show, there was no idea aside from the title. Netflix asked, 'Do you want to do a show called _Space Force_?' And I pretty much immediately said, 'Well yeah, sure. That sounds great.' And then I called Greg, and I said, 'Hey, you want to do a show called _Space Force_?' And he said, 'Yeah, that sounds good. Let's do it.' And it was really based on nothing, except this name that made everybody laugh. So we were off and running."

YUBA CITY, Calif. (AP) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom says the state will gradually allow certain business to reopen as soon as Friday, as the state sees hopeful signs in data tracking the spread of the coronavirus. The plan outlined Monday includes a range of retailers that would be permitted to reopen, including clothing, sporting goods and flower shops. However there would be restrictions, such as curbside pickups. It did not include dine-in eating at restaurants and reopening of offices. Newsom says a key consideration for loosening stay-at-home orders is the ability for health authorities to conduct widespread testing and establish a system to determine if someone who is infected might have spread the virus to someone else.

The timing is the most inexplicable of all. Though lockdown has been extended, industry all over the country is being told to restart. Other measures and lockdown relaxations to slowly restart other segments of the economy are also in the works in all states. After weeks of idleness and no income, the migrant workers, hailing mainly from the eastern states and spread largely across the south and west of the country, could possibly at last see some hope of being able to start earning again, as a restarting economy is going to need this labour in the coming weeks.

The core module slots into the guitar's body and is held in place using magnets. When in place, it has the look of a custom scratchplate. The one man operation behind Fern Guitars says that he's aiming for an open source approach where pretty much anything goes, so long as it can be installed on the module without affecting play.
 "While I’ll certainly have stock configurations, the modules are designed to be a blank canvas," he said in a blog post. "Anything that can fit on the plate is a possibility. Want a touchscreen, extra knobs or MIDI integration? I’ll work with you to try and make that happen. My philosophy is that if we can fit it on the module in a way that keeps the guitar playable, nothing is off the table. And of course, the blank plates will be available for people to work on at home, should you be so inclined."
 Work on the next iteration of the prototype has begun, with the eventual aim being to offer affordable modular options, though exactly how affordable hasn't been revealed at this early stage in development. You can see a demo of the current prototype in the video below.

Groups including the NAACP, meanwhile, have called for greater government action to prevent the virus' spread in response to statistics showing that COVID-19 is killing disproportionate numbers of black people.
 An Associated Press analysis of available state and local data shows that nearly one-third of those who have died are African American, with black people representing about 14% of the population in the areas covered in the analysis.
 The toll in black communities, leaders say, reflects systemic policies that have made many African Americans far more vulnerable to the virus, including unequal access to health care and economic opportunity. That means many will face an untenable choice: go back to work or face unemployment with no benefits, said Antonio Lightfoot, an organizer for the Workers Center for Racial Justice in Chicago.
 The Rev. William J. Barber, who advocates for groups that often perform front- line jobs, said black people aren’t the only ones being devalued.
 “The issue is not what these protests are saying to just black people but what they are saying to poor and low-income people who are the most impacted," said Barber. “Invitations to open up society and encourage people to return to their routines is an invitation to death.”

The Chicago carrier warned its 12,250 pilots in a memo to prepare for “displacement” that affects 30% of them, or nearly 3,700 pilots. In a separate memo, United told employees it is planning at least a 30% cut in management and administrative staff, or 3,450 of them. Under terms of $5 billion in federal virus-relief aid, United can't lay off employees through September.
