"We think there is still time to work on a model that is fair for everyone. There are elements we absolutely agree with and we are supportive of tenants but tenants need to understand in the long term this will damage everyone and I think a reasonable tenant looking at this would see the owner has been forgotten and that is unjust."

LW: As we exit the crisis we of course want to make sure that people have the resources to maintain their lives every day so they're not being evicted if they're renting or lose their homes if they're paying their mortgage and I believe that right now that we have solutions for much of that and I want to make sure they can continue to provide nutrition to their families and be able to access health care at the health care systems and we want them to be able to get back to work and we want to make sure small businesses can maintain. You've seen that the city, the county, the state and the federal government have released a number of different programs to help small businesses and micro-businesses weather the storm and Rochester, our economy, we don't have a number of large employers, but what we do have is a number of micro-, small and medium-sized employers so we want to make sure that we keep them going and give them the resources that they need to open back up and get back to work and employ their employees again. And that's one thing that we think is very important. So there's a three-pronged approach, take care of the people, take care of their health, but also take care of the businesses so people can get back to work.

LW: I would say find things for them to do. I would say spend time with your family. I think one thing that this virus has done is to make sure we all understand what's important, right? And so all those things that we might have idolized like work or watching entertainment, all those things that we idolized, now we're forced to take stock and take a step back and look at your home. And I would also say lean on your faith. Understand that you children didn't ask to come here, we chose to bring them here and now that we are parents they need to understand what's happening, they're scared as well, they're not at school with their peers, they're not with their teacher and that experience is challenging, but do fun things with them. My daughter and I have been doing science experiments, there's coloring you can do, things that don't cost a lot of money, things that you can do in your home together. Go out and take them for a bike ride or walk or something, just to get out of the house for a moment, but maintain social distancing while doing that. Most important is to let them know that you love them and that you're all in this together and that we will get out of this together.

If there was one lesson that I found most important for anyone who may be starting university this fall or who still has years remaining, is that every single story is different. I think we live in a society where we are constantly being judged by our decisions — where to go to school, what job we want to get in the summer, what our plans are after graduating. For every major life decision I’ve made, there’s always one or two people who have questioned it. They think there was a better choice. When I chose Brock, I had a guidance counsellor who looked at me like I was from outer space. When I chose to work at summer camps, I had a parent who thought I should have chosen something that paid better. At the end of the day, there will always be someone there to nit pick and judge some of your decisions. No matter what, I encourage you to choose what you think is best for you. Your path through life won’t be identical to anyone else, it’s unique to you and that’s why you have to live your own life.
