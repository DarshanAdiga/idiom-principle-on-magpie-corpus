HARRISBURG -- Counting an avalanche of 1.4 million mail-in votes dragged through a third day in Pennsylvania on Thursday as some races from Tuesday's primary remained too close to call.
   
 Some counties had yet to report any mail-in ballot count, while others had reported a fraction of theirs. The Associated Press has not yet called a number of races where the contest was close or had a large number of votes yet to be counted, or both.
   
 Those races included several where incumbent state lawmakers trailed in the count and the only competitive primary among the statewide races, a six-way Democratic primary contest for auditor general.
   
 It also included a closely watched Democratic primary contest between Eugene DePasquale, the outgoing state auditor general, and lawyer Tom Brier for the nomination to challenge four-term Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry in the Harrisburg-based 10th District.
   
 More than 1.8 million voters applied for a mail-in or absentee ballot, smashing expectations by state officials for the debut of the state's new vote-by-mail law and drawing warnings that many contest results would be delayed. Voters returned almost 1.4 million of them, or 75.5%, according to information from the state's elections office Thursday.
   
 Thus far, The AP has called four races in which incumbents lost, all of them in Democratic primaries for a state legislative seat.
   
 Lawmakers had voted to postpone the primary election from April 28 to avoid the height of Pennsylvania's spike in coronavirus cases, and candidates and political parties had urged voters to cast ballots by mail to protect themselves from getting infected.
   
 The lack of drama in the outcome of the presidential contests and the massive mail-in vote produced light in-person turnout throughout the state.
   
 Turnout hit 1.9 million, or 22% of Pennsylvania's 8.6 million registered voters. Meanwhile, deadlines to accept mailed ballots were extended into next week in Philadelphia and six counties that are home to a total of 3.8 million voters.
   
 A judge in Delaware County rejected a challenge by the county's Republicans to an order by Gov. Tom Wolf allowing the counting of mail-in ballots through next Tuesday as along as they were postmarked before the election.
   
 Wolf, a Democrat, issued the order Monday for Philadelphia, Delaware County and four other counties under an emergency declaration in areas experiencing demonstrations over George Floyd's death.

La rebaja del IVA es precisamente una de las medidas aprobadas por Alemania en respuesta a la crisis, si bien la ministra de Hacienda, María Jesús Montero, replicó que ese país tiene siete u ocho puntos más de presión fiscal que este y además planea rebajar algunos tramos de ese impuesto a tipos que aquí ya son más bajos.

Many schools have shifted their admissions requirements to SAT and ACT optional policies in direct response to canceled spring administrations. Some schools have taken this as an opportunity to implement long-term changes to their testing requirements, such as the University of California, which will implement a test-optional policy for the fall of 2021 and 2022, and then shift to a test-blind policy for fall 2023 and fall 2024. The test-optional policy will apply to all students in the class of 2021-2022, but the test blind policy for the 2023-2024 entering classes will apply to California residents and may look different for non-residential students, according to a timeline for the future of standardized testing at UC.

That was until 2017, when they had a chance meeting at a Bentley dealership and the pair discovered a passion for each other and Kendall was soon seen court side at his games.
 After looking like there could be something, there ended up being nothing and their romance fizzled out before it could really catch fire.
 In 2015, Kendall met Los Angeles Lakers rookie D’Angelo Russell but despite media reports that they were getting it on, they always insisted that they were just good friends.
 The following year it was another Lakers player, Jordan Clarkson, who was in the dating sights of Kendall and a video of them kissing on New Year's Eve was soon being shared on social media.
 They reportedly 'secretly dated' but it didn't last until the next New Year celebrations.

If anything, I feel this area values genuine people and I've learned a lot from them. Appalachians, in general, don't mince words. If they think you're full of it, they'll tell you that, regardless of your station in life. (I have personally experienced this many times). The vast majority of them appreciate politeness and etiquette but they aren't afraid of a fight or roughing it. And I mean that in more ways than one. Appalachians, and I particularly reference Gallians, are a tough lot who have survived the worst drug epidemic of the era, continue to strive toward better education and make the best of limited resources in an area historically challenged by a lack of jobs and income. If the public doesn't find help, they find a way to make solutions. It's a "take the bull by the horns" mentality shared among Appalachians. They take care of their own but they expect others to contribute in helping others in kind or you're on your own.

These current events are the most disruptive times in many of our lifetimes, but they are nothing new – nor are they particularly awful. We are not headed toward a new civil war, so everyone – on the Left and Right – should stop using over-the-top rhetoric. It only encourages us to view our fellow Americans as enemies, to see ourselves as members of warring tribes rather than citizens of a nation, and desensitizes us to violence. The nation has real divisions, and singing Kumbaya won’t heal them, but our society still functions remarkably well.

That is till now.
 In one magical moment last Monday on a street outside the White House, it all changed for me as the president boldly strode through the throng protesting police brutality, parting them like Moses in the Red Sea, then standing on the church steps hoisting a Bible, resembling a huckster scalping tickets outside an NFL stadium.
 It was that look on Trump’s face as he held the Bible upside-down that really enthralled me. Where had I seen that look before? For some reason, the quote “What, me worry?” kept running through my head.
 Then it came to me, like a thunderbolt from heaven, the world was witnessing a miracle — the reincarnation of Rasputin the Mad Monk!
 Grigori Rasputin was a Siberian peasant who became a charismatic holy man during the early 1900s. Using his wiles, he eventually became a mentor to Czar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra. His enemies suspected Rasputin of influencing Russian diplomacy so assassinated him in 1916.
 Like Rasputin, Donald Trump has risen from a struggling young proletariat with a measly million dollars in his pocket to a powerful political figure. Based on Monday’s inspirational photo, Trump is also an aspiring holy man grappling with the great mystery researched by scholars for centuries seeking the correct way to hold a Bible.
 There were early indications that an evangelical path was being paved for Trump. One sign was he claimed that the Bible is his favorite book; that is, except when he claimed that "The Art of the Deal" by Donald Trump is his favorite book.
 Once asked his favorite verses in the Bible Trump replied, “I wouldn’t want to get into it because to me that’s very personal. You know when I talk about the Bible, it’s very personal. So, I don’t want to get into verses.” Amen, a wise and introspective response one would expect from a holy man.
 The one time when Trump did "get into verses" and publicly shared a favorite passage about “bending to envy,” biblical scholars said it does not exist, but what do they know.
 When asked if he favors the Old Testament or the New Testament, Trump, in the sage manner of a religious guru, proffered this deeply moving reply, “Probably equal. I think it’s just an incredible — the whole Bible is incredible.”
 In contrast to his normal unassuming and humble manner, Trump revealed in 2016 that “Nobody reads the Bible more than me.” An admission which, of course, surprised no one since he appears so knowledgeable concerning Bible verses in both the Old and New Testaments.

Where we live, June evenings bring fireflies - "lightning bugs" dancing their way across the starry background.      This is a real pleasure of stepping out on a clear night in June. The field we have out back, darkened by the night, would look like a field of stars if those fireflies would stand still. Instead they move about, blinking on and off, a show in my mind coupled with the constellations above, beats any man- made fireworks show.      One night I was looking through my reflecting telescope and a firefly entered through the open end of the tube. You can imagine the distraction!      The stars, though seemingly unchanging and still, looking as they did to our ancestors of old, aren't all that different than the firefly. Like this flashy insect, the stars actually are in constant motion, and many of them "blink" \- mostly at very slow rates (days, weeks, months) as they vary in magnitude.      The stars don't seem to be shifting because they are so immensely far. A few though, are crossing the heavenly sphere at a fast enough clip and are close enough, that a user of even a small telescope could trace its motion over a few years. One of the most famous is Barnard's Star, in Ophiucus.      As darkness falls in mid-June - once the moon is out of the way - look southeast for the large constellations Ophiucus and Serpens. Note: Serpens is broken in two, on either side of Ophiucus.      Ancient Greeks depicted Ophiucus as the renowned physican Aesculapius, the inventor and god of medicine, holding Serpens the Snake across his knees. Ophiucus is also depicted standing on Scorpius the Scorpion, the constellation immediately below it and marked with a fabulous, bright red star, Antares.      Dr. Ophiucus, I don't think, would be recognized by my health insurance plan.      Barnard's Star is of 9.5 magnitude, requiring a telescope of about 3-inch aperture or larger to easily see. You need a detailed star chart showing the myriad of similarly faint stars to track down which one is Barnard's Star.      Although appearing motionless in the eyepiece, if you were to take photographs or very carefully plot the stars on paper, you could repeat this in a few years and see that Barnard's Star has actually moved.      It was discovered by Professor Emerson Bernard in 1916. He noticed it had shifted by comparing his photographic plate with plates taken in 1894 and 1904.      The star has the highest proper motion of any star we see, moving at 10.3 "seconds of arc" per year.      (A degree on the sky, equal to about two full moons, is equivalent to 60 minutes of arc. Each minute has 60 seconds of arc.)      Barnard observed that in 22 years the star moved by four minutes of arc - about a third of the apparent separation of the famous double star Mizar and Alcor in the Big Dipper's handle.      Barnard's Star is a red dwarf star and only six light-years away, among the very closest. Astronomer Peter Van de Kamp, in 1963, had become convinced that an apparent wobble in the star's path was due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet.      His assertion was not vindicated until 2018 when a planet, 3.2 times the size of Earth, was discovered orbiting the star.   Full moon is on June 6.      Keep looking up at the sky!

 Erie police said a male motorist is facing charges in a Wednesday night crash involving a city police cruiser that sent an officer and a female passenger in the male's vehicle to the hospital.
 The crash happened at the intersection of West 23rd and Liberty streets on Wednesday at about 11:45 p.m. Three independent witnesses said a 2006 Audi was traveling west on West 23rd Street at a high rate of speed when it went through a stop sign and traveled in front of a 2020 Erie Bureau of Police Ford Explorer patrol vehicle that was traveling south on Liberty Street, Erie police Captain Rick Lorah said Thursday morning. The officer was not responding to a call at the time of the crash, he said.
 The two vehicles collided, causing significant damage to the police cruiser, Lorah said. The Audi then struck a parked vehicle before coming to rest, he said.
 The driver of the Audi was taken into custody on suspicion of driving under the influence and will face charges in the crash, Lorah said. The charges had not been filed as of Thursday morning.
 A female passenger in the man's car fled the crash scene but later showed up at Saint Vincent Hospital for treatment of minor injuries, Lorah said.
 The officer driving the police cruiser was transported to the hospital and was later released, he said.

MEDIA COURTHOUSE — Delaware County Common Pleas Court Judge Barry Dozor on Thursday granted the Delaware County Regional Water Quality Control Authority a temporary stay on county council’s ordinance to terminate the authority and transfer its assets to the county.
 “The vote by Delaware County Council (Wednesday) night, while most people were without power and in the midst of a pandemic, would have created undue harm for ratepayers in the form of huge rate increases,” DELCORA said in a statement. “DELCORA looks forward to having its day in court and making its case on behalf of ratepayers.”
 The order comes one day after council voted 4-0 to approve an ordinance that would dissolve the authority and bring all of its funds, assets, operations and liabilities under county control. Council members indicated passing the ordinance also put the kibosh on a pending $276.5 million merger between DELCORA and Aqua Pennsylvania Wastewater Inc., unanimously approved by the DELCORA board last year.

 ORLEANS -- Not long ago, Mike McNamara, who owns Hog Island Beer Company, was talking to a few friends, also small business owners, about creative partnerships.
 The moment was reminiscent of those vintage Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercials where chocolate and peanut butter meet in happy surprise. But some would say McNamara and Chatham Kelp make a better pairing: kelp and beer, or more specifically, kelp and stout.
 "We agreed we'd love to do something fun and cool … that ties directly to our area," said McNamara.
 Though Covid-19 has changed the way everyone is doing business, this is a bright spot.
 "Our slogan is, 'Kelp is on the way,'" said McNamara. Although the kelp- infused beer is not yet ready, "everything is bubbling so to speak."
 As the partnership ferments, Chatham Kelp has wrapped up a second successful season. On a recent afternoon Jamie Bassett stood in a greenhouse at Pine Tree Nursery picking dried kelp from lines strung from the ceiling with Richard Curtiss.
 "We've had a banner year," Bassett said, popping a piece of crispy kale into his mouth. "They dried beautifully. It is very nice, crunchy, kind of tastes like umami."
 Some call umami the fifth taste after sweet, sour, bitter and salt. Bold, savory, it has driven the recent popularity of kelp. The bulk of the product comes from Asia, but is increasingly grown in New England.
 Bassett and Curtiss co-own Chatham Kelp with Carl Douglass; it's one of three companies permitted on the Cape (there are a few on the islands). It is the only one that is a standalone farm, not associated with a shellfish grant.
 They had the idea for kelp farming several years ago, but between developing a business plan and navigating a nine-agency permitting gauntlet (ultimately receiving all unanimous votes), they planted their first crop late in 2018.
 The state Division of Marine Fisheries was one of the agencies in the gauntlet and Christopher Schillaci, who was the division's aquaculture specialist at the time, remembers the project well.
 Schillaci knew kelp was a nascent industry, with undeveloped markets. After meeting the trio he thought they just may make it work.
 "I always had hopes for these guys because they had the background that would make them successful," he said. "These are folks you can have honest conversations with, they understand it's not going to be a breeze."
 Schillaci, who now works as aquaculture coordinator in the Greater Atlantic Region for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the three hustled to find markets and understood the technical and biological aspects of the venture. They learned so much they could give TED talks, he said.
 "They went out and did what they said they were going to do and that helps build confidence in a new industry," Schillaci said.
 Bassett is from Chatham, his family goes back generations, and he has known Douglass, also a shellfisherman, for close to 30 years. Douglass was friends with Curtiss and introduced him to Bassett. As fate would have it, they were all sitting at a popular local hangout, the Red Nun, talking about Douglass's desire to have an oyster grant.
 Since Chatham doesn't allow new grants, they started spit balling other ideas.
 "We were trying to think outside the box," Bassett said. "It grew from there."
 The first year they started small and planted five strings, with the help of GreenWave, a Connecticut company that farms kelp and helps others get started.
 Most of the harvest was sold to upscale spots that make a point of celebrating local food.
 Award-winning Chef Michael Ceraldi, who owns Ceraldi's in Wellfleet, is famous for the seven-course, prix fixe culinary experience he offers using all Cape- sourced ingredients, including beef and pork. He first saw Chatham Kelp on Instagram and was smitten.
 "The literal health benefits are vast. It is so vitamin-rich," he said, adding that the flavor is wonderful as well.
 He has served kelp as pasta in a clam sauce, as a seaweed salad, wrapped fish in it, the list goes on. He was so impressed he worked Chatham Kelp's harvest into a meal he served at the James Beard Foundation, basically the Academy Awards for chefs.
 But kelp, which can go for about $64 a pound, has many uses beyond a sea vegetable, Bassett explained.
 "The best, in my opinion, is the cosmetic market," said Bassett.
 "For example, kelp face masks. Not the kind of masks we are dealing with today," Curtiss added, referring to virus protection.
 Bassett explained that this year the majority of the harvest is going to be used in luxury soaps bearing the Chatham Kelp name, produced on Cape at Atlantic Soap Company -- about to celebrate its one-year anniversary. It should be available in the fall, before the holidays.
 Caroline Laye, the owner and soap maker of the Falmouth-based shop, said Curtiss reached out late last year with the idea. The partnership made sense because she tries to use all local ingredients, with local seawater as a base.
 The hope is to make something elegant and sophisticated. The presence of Cape- grown kelp will serve as a moisturizer and add minerals to the soap as well as beauty.
 Chatham Kelp is running out of product, but next year they plan on increasing the number of strings planted from 10 to 15.
 Only a small portion of their 50-acre farm is used so far, and bright, yellow buoy balls with Chatham Kelp written on them mark the area.
 On a recent grey day, Bassett maneuvered his boat, Curtiss aboard, to harvest some of the kelp growing just off Harding's Beach.
 The kelp is grown on horizontal lines, about seven feet under the water. With the boat stopped, Curtiss swung a buoy aboard and began slowly pulling up the line. Thick, luxuriant kelp filled the tote.
 "Golden baby kelp. As fresh as it gets," said Curtiss.

RYE - The deal that would have finally met the growing needs of the Town Hall, after a decade of trying, has fallen through.
   
 In March, voters approved a land swap that would have the town acquire the former TD Bank building on Washington Road, in exchange for the Parsonage, a town-owned property that had been used by the Housing Partnership as subsidized housing. Some of the town offices would move from Central Avenue to the former bank and Rye resident Daniel Philbrick would renovate the historic Parsonage, making about eight market-rate apartments.
   
 Concerns over the property line between the Parsonage and Rye Public Library delayed the May 31 deadline to have a subdivision plan before the town Planning Board. On June 1, Philbrick exercised his option to void the agreement with the town. Philbrick could have extended it.
   
 A Planning Board meeting on the subdivision was rescheduled to July 14 from June 9.
   
 "We signed the contract six months ago," Philbrick said. "Within the past 30 days it became clear that the library trustees were not comfortable with the plan. They are concerned about future expansion of the library. We have always had a good relationship with the library. I think it might be better to take some time to do this right."
   
 Philbrick in a letter to town officials said he felt confident the exchange/swap agreement would have resulted in a beneficial outcome for the town. He said his plan for the Parsonage would have been appropriate as the abutting property for the library. He also expressed the belief the best use for the Parsonage property would emerge in time, with town officials working with the library trustees and the Historic District Commission.
   
 Library trustees say if the plan goes forward as it is, they will lose land up to the walkways currently on the library property. They say the land includes landscaping and lighting for the safety of evening patrons that the library put in place and maintains.
   
 Selectmen hope to resurrect the deal. Chairman Phil Winslow said the plan dates back to early last summer when they held a planning meeting to determine the best way to proceed with the town center. One recommendation was to do something with the Parsonage, which needs extensive renovations.
   
 "I think the cost to renovate was just shy of $1 million," Winslow said. "The Housing Partnership's contract was up and we decided we did not want to be in the housing business. Then, Mr. Philbrick came along and expressed an interest in the exchange. We thought it was a good idea for all. It could meet the Town Hall needs, and the Parsonage in the center of town would be renovated. We appraised both properties and the TD Bank building came in higher. It was a good deal. I am optimistic and I hope we can salvage this. Fifty-eight percent of our residents voted in favor of this."
   
 Winslow said Selectman Keriann Roman, who is an attorney, has been working with the library trustees and will meet with them again next week to see if a resolution can be reached.
   
 Winslow said the trustees disagreed with survey results and wanted more control over the land in question. About $15,000 was approved by voters in March to survey the property and Winslow said a draft survey has been completed.
   
 Jeff Ross, chairman of the Rye Public Library Board of Trustees, said they expressed concerns with the plan since before the March 10 elections.
   
 "We raised issues about the property lines and were told we would be involved," Ross said. "That has not happened."
   
 Ross said the Parsonage property line would come up to the library walkways, on land the library acquired in 1995 and which was part of the library since the design and construction of the building expansion in 1999.
   
 "Voters in March approved the swap but not specific boundary lines," Ross said. "New Hampshire law indicates the library property we have had custody of, is the library property. We never opposed the swap and are not trying to go against the will of the voters. We are still open to discussion with the town about this."
   
 In a letter to the selectmen, the trustees indicate that while they have never opposed the subdivision of the Parsonage land, they will continue to "strongly oppose the inclusion of the land, which has been and should continue to be viewed as library property."
   
 "What happens from here is in the hands of the selectmen," Philbrick said "We do not want to have bigger concerns with the library, and we have always supported the library. It is a disappointment to me because I believe it was a good solution for the town."

Erie police said a male motorist is facing charges in a Wednesday night crash involving a city police cruiser that sent an officer and a female passenger in the male's vehicle to the hospital.
   
 The crash happened at the intersection of West 23rd and Liberty streets on Wednesday at about 11:45 p.m. Three independent witnesses said a 2006 Audi was traveling west on West 23rd Street at a high rate of speed when it went through a stop sign and traveled in front of a 2020 Erie Bureau of Police Ford Explorer patrol vehicle that was traveling south on Liberty Street, Erie police Captain Rick Lorah said Thursday morning. The officer was not responding to a call at the time of the crash, he said.
   
 The two vehicles collided, causing significant damage to the police cruiser, Lorah said. The Audi then struck a parked vehicle before coming to rest, he said.
   
 The driver of the Audi was taken into custody on suspicion of driving under the influence and will face charges in the crash, Lorah said. The charges had not been filed as of Thursday morning.
   
 A female passenger in the man's car fled the crash scene but later showed up at Saint Vincent Hospital for treatment of minor injuries, Lorah said.
   
 The officer driving the police cruiser was transported to the hospital and was later released, he said.

PITTSBURGH -- James Conner didn't treat the quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as an obstacle, but an opportunity.
   
 While the shutdown forced the Pittsburgh Steelers running back to cancel a couple of planned vacations, it also gave him time -- a lot of time -- to filter out the noise heading into the most important season of his career.
   
 "(It) helped me get away from all distractions," Conner, an Erie native, said Tuesday. "I'm not saying they're all distractions, but not going out, to stay home and cook at home, and not be able to maybe go out on weekends. It forces people to stay home, so with that time at home I was just trying to get better."
   
 A process that included an aggressive workout plan designed to help Conner avoid the injuries that have dogged him since the Steelers took him in the third round of the 2017 draft.
   
 While the 25-year-old has shown flashes at times and reached the Pro Bowl in 2018 thanks to an electric first half, he's missed 10 games over the past two seasons and has topped 100 total yards just three times in his past 15 starts.
   
 While general manager Kevin Colbert has repeatedly stressed the organization still believes in Conner, the club also declined to approach him with a new deal. Conner insists he didn't take the decision personally.
   
 "That's the game," he said. "I want to do a lot more so I can give a lot more to this organization. I trust the Lord's timing. I'm not concerned about the extension. I know I've got another year left on my contract. I'll give it all I got for one more year and see how it plays out. ... I'm just going to ball out."
   
 Conner, who won a battle with lymphoma during his college days at Pittsburgh, isn't concerned about his health being at risk whenever he and his teammates get back to work in person. He called himself "100%" ready to play under whatever safety guidelines are enacted to help combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.
   
 "We're going to play it safe, of course," Conner said. "I'm not going to ignore it, but as far as me being scared or taking extra precautions because of my health history. That was four years ago. My body's healed. When we follow the protocols and health guidelines, I'll be just fine."
   
 Or, he hopes, better than that. He's developed a rigorous workout regiment that he's documented heavily on social media.
   
 He raised eyebrows last week when he posted a series of pictures that included a look at his hulking back. The 6-foot-1, 233-pounder joked it was "just the angle" and that "lots of people look like that."
   
 Not exactly. Conner arrived in the NFL off a record-setting career at Pitt, where he developed a reputation as a bruising runner who would just as soon run over a defender as he would run around one.
   
 He's become leaner and more versatile with the Steelers. He's caught 89 passes over the past two years and has proven to be valuable in pass protection.
   
 While the Steelers have professed faith in him, they've also hedged their bets. They took a running back in the draft for the fourth straight year when they selected Anthony McFarland out of Maryland in the fourth round.
   
 He joins a group that includes Conner, Benny Snell, Trey Edmunds and Jaylen Samuels. That's a lot of bodies and only one football at their disposal.
   
 "If I'm the guy, or however this year works, the goal is to win," Conner said. "We've got to be ready at all times. You can't warm-up to it. That's been our slogan, `We can't warm-up to it.' So I'm not paying attention to how many carries I need."
   
 Conner believes the return of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger from elbow surgery puts the Steelers back into the mix in the AFC. Pittsburgh still found a way to finish 8-8 last season with Roethlisberger playing all of six quarters.
   
 Conner was effective in spurts but had just 18 touches over the final eight games because of a right shoulder injury suffered in the final seconds of a win over Miami in which he rolled up 145 yards rushing.
   
 "There's nothing I can do to get last year back," Conner said. "I'm working every day hard as possible to be in the best shape ever, to be the best football player I can be. I'm going to give it everything I have. That's just where my mindset is. I'm not trying to make it bigger than what it is. All it is is perform. I do that when I'm on the field."

“Montreal is fortunate to have an excellent public tree inventory, ‘but many of the city’s trees are actually located on private land, and we know very little about them. This means our understanding of the urban forest is like a puzzle with half the pieces missing,” says Ziter.
 Ziter is a member of the CERC Smart Sustainable Resilient Cities and Communities team.
 Her contribution to the CERC team is to highlight the essential role of urban green space and biodiversity in creating a next-generation city. Ziter’s work finds nature-based solutions to ensure the health and well-being of urban residents.
 Making sense of our urban ‘patchwork’
 “Our cities are like patchwork quilts — made up of bits and pieces of built infrastructure and different kinds of green spaces. Private yards make up a really important — and really big! — piece of that ecological fabric,” she says.
 With this in mind, Ziter and her MSc student Kayleigh Hutt-Taylor created a project to map trees on private land around Concordia’s Loyola Campus.
 Initially, the project would have involved Ziter and her students — known as the “tree team” — visiting participants’ homes to measure and document the species of the owners’ trees.
 But the COVID-19 pandemic meant the project had to change gears.
 The result? A do-it-yourself approach that allows participants to measure trees themselves, using basic tools that include string or twine, a notebook or downloadable worksheet, and a camera or smartphone.
 “This project speaks to the university’s strong commitment to sustainability,” says Concordia President Graham Carr.
 “The fact that our researchers were able to adapt it to our current situation is an example of our community’s resilience and ingenuity. I hope many of our Loyola neighbours will take this opportunity to get outside and learn about the trees in our own backyards.”
 ‘Citizen science’
 “We decided to take a ‘citizen science’ approach, asking residents to participate in data collection for their own yards,” Ziter explains.
 “At its heart, scientific research is often about creative problem-solving, and I think this is a good example of that creativity in action,” she adds. “Now that we’ve made the switch, I’m actually really excited about the potential of this new direction to lead to a more powerful overall project. Maybe we should have been doing this all along!”
 “Finding new ways to engage the public has been an exciting challenge for me,” says Hutt-Taylor. The project will eventually form the backbone of her master’s thesis and will hopefully be expanded with Ziter’s Urban Landscape Ecology lab in the coming years.
 “I tried to create a project that is both interactive and easy to follow. The hope is that local residents will learn a bit about nature in their own backyard, while also contributing to our overall understanding of Montreal’s urban forest,” Hutt-Taylor adds.

The shift in the market comes after years of steep increases pushed some tenants out of their neighborhoods, while crimping the budgets of others.
 Annual rent increases started to slow even before the coronavirus outbreak, which analysts attributed to the fact that many tenants had reached their limit.
 As president of property management firm Eberly Co., Chuck Eberly manages about 2,700 units in the Los Angeles area across the market spectrum, from high-end properties to working-class apartments.
 Eberly said he’s had to offer a couple of weeks of free rent and in some cases dropped rent outright, mostly for his more expensive properties. Although he called the rent declines “small adjustments,” he expects he’ll be forced to make more cuts down the road.
