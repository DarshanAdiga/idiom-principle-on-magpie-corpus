There is a wide variance in how much Covid-19 has affected councils, and some are more exposed than others. The smaller rural councils, which already operated much more limited services, might end up faring better over time.
 Clive Manley, the chief executive of the Ruapehu District Council, says his organisation hadn't started with any luxuries in the first place, as services had already been "cut to the bone". However, he says the council has still been in a position to help people and businesses going into hardship.
 While the Ruapehu District Council has had more costs to bear over the period, it isn't yet seeing a significant loss in revenue from the rating base - in part because a third of properties in the district are owned by non-residents, and because the economic base of the region is in primary industries. Cuts may have to be made over the next year, but they'll be made with pruning clippers, rather than a chainsaw.
 "The small rural councils - we've been criticised by the Productivity Commission for not doing enough user-pays, we don't do enough targeted things for services. Well, that is why we're not impacted as badly as Auckland. It's because we're not dependent on activities," says Manley.

 Everyone has their opinions about birthdays. Some look forward to their next one and then there are some individuals that dread their next birthday for various reasons. I myself am no stranger to birthdays having celebrated 79 (sic) of them with the last one occurring just a couple of months ago on April 23.  
 Young children are excited about their upcoming birthdays because of the many presents they expect to receive and the special cakes that they ordered. My youngest granddaughter was so excited on her 13th birthday because she had ordered a Unicorn birthday cake. Others can't wait until they are 16 and get their driver's license (unfortunately for them the new law in Ohio is now 16 1/2).  
 Then there are those that can't wait until they are 18 and out of school and sadly some can't wait until they are 21 and can legally drink alcoholic beverages.  
 Then there are some that time is passing much too fast and fears enter their minds. I know that my wife confessed to me that she was devastated when she turned 40. Then there are others that always look forward to their next birthday saying it's much better to wake up above ground rather than under it.  
 Some look forward to getting a mailbox full of cards wishing them a happy birthday with some being funny, some religious, and then some very special from family members or lovers. Then there are those that are on social media and get a multitude of well wishes. Small children on the other hand could care less about receiving a birthday card especially if it doesn't contain any money.  
 I for one think I'll start a new trend on my birthday. Instead of expecting well wishes, I think I'll practice the old Hawaiian Ho'oponopono philosophy (which claims that these 10 words are most powerful) by saying ... I love you, I'm sorry, please forgive me, thank you. Maybe there's some truth in saying these words (audibly or silently) 10 times daily; maybe it would literally change the world. The Bible tells us similarly that these very same words need to be said from one to another.  
 I also think I'll start another birthday tradition; that being rather than receiving gifts as the birthday boy, I'm going to give gifts to the ones I truly love. Doesn't the Bible say somewhere \"that it's better to give than receive.\"  
 See you next Sunday.

Along with the ban on tobacco products and the incorrect assumption that the state could directly meet the basic nutritional needs of the population via the delivery of food parcels, the response to the religious lobby is reminiscent of Juvenal’s comment under imperial Rome some two thousand years ago that all the people really want is “bread and circuses”. This is not what people want or need. They require the power to express their actual needs and interests and the democratic means to ensure that government responds to these.

Besides the standard answers of the speed of the game and the multitude of talent that exists in the college game, Yoder learned one of aspect about playing football at that level.
 “It’s like a job,” he said. “You spend eight hours per day in practice, in meetings and in conditioning and that is on top of the things you do on your own like watching extra film. My roommate and I spend a lot of time watching film together on our own. We don’t have to do that but we know there are other players doing it and if we want to remain competitive we have to do the extra things like that.
 “One of the coaches here told me you either like it or love it. By like he meant you do the bare minimum and by love he meant doing all you can.”
 Yoder shared some team goals and some of his own personal goals for the upcoming season.
 “Team-wise we want to win the conference championship and make a huge run in the postseason,” he said. “Personally, I want to get my kick return average over 27 yards and want to get more than 900 return yards once again,” he said.
 The Tribe is slated to open the 2020 season Sept. 5 against the Stanford Cardinal in Palo Alto, Calif.
 “I am so excited for that game,” Yoder said. “Last season we played Virginia and the year before Virginia Tech. Every year we play a ‘big dog’ and not just to play them. We want to show people we can compete with the bigger schools.
 “I have been a fan of Stanford since the days of Christian McCaffrey. I love the way he carries himself on and off the field.”
 McCaffrey set the NCAA record for all-purpose yards in a season with 3,864 for the Cardinal in 2015. He broke the record of 3,250 yards by Barry Sanders.
 McCaffrey was the eighth pick of the first round of the 2017 draft by the Carolina Panthers.
 Yoder is home working construction this summer. He plans on taking an online course in July. He is also waiting on word when he can return to the campus in Williamsburg, Virginia.
 “We have not gotten word on when we can go back,” Yoder said. “There are crazy times we are going through.”
 When talking about crazy times, Yoder shared some thoughts on the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, which has sparked protests around the country, some of which have turned violent.
 “It’s a shame that in America the only way a subject like this gets any attention is by rioting and protests,” Yoder said. “This speaks volumes about my white privilege because I have never been racially profiled or have not been in fear for my life because of the color of my skin like some of my teammates have been. Our head coach (Mike London) has told us America needs to wake up. There are changes that need to be made.”

Since then the console has been restocked a few times, however, it has always proceeded to sell out almost immediately, leaving many who want to pick up the Nintendo…

 A side trip to Winchester to see his former JMU coach turned into an even better opportunity - a part-time paid position as the pitching coach and recruiting coordinator for Division III Shenandoah University.
 "He was looking to get back into the (college) game," said Kevin Anderson, the long-time coach at Shenandoah. "The kids love him. He is very knowledgeable about the sport. He hit the ground running and has not looked back."

 The coronavirus pandemic has not stopped travel on U.S. Highways 281 and 50, but the safety factor of those crossing that infamous intersection near St. John, Kansas has increased. A new $5.2 million roundabout where those highways intersect in Stafford County three miles south of St. John has been completed. After months of work starting in 2019, traffic is flowing smoothly through what had become a controversial project for some.
 The new roundabout features an inner circle for regular traffic and a permanent detour outer diamond shape to accommodate oversize loads, said Scott Mullen, Kansas Department of Transportation area engineer.
 The roundabout and diamond are designed to prevent the most severe accidents including t-bones and collisions at high speeds. Any collision at the intersection should be under 30 mph, Mullen said.
 Tim Potter, KDOT public affairs manager, said roundabouts are used at intersections that have a significant history of crashes and where KDOT has taken steps to mitigate crashes but those efforts were not successful.
 In this case, the intersection has a history of injury accidents, fatal accidents and damage to property accidents.
 \"There is a significant crash history over the years,\" Potter said.
 With the roundabout, any crash would be a glancing blow or sideswipe as opposed to a t-bone or angle crash and at a lower speed.
 A roundabout allows traffic to continue moving unless a driver has to yield to other drivers already in the roundabout. All drivers have to reduce speed to enter the roundabout.
 Prior to the roundabout, traffic on U.S. 281 was required to stop both north and southbound but traffic in U.S. 50 had no stop signs and no decrease in speed limit.
 There were several warnings in place for U.S. 281 drivers including rumble strips and multiple signs, some with lights, warning drivers to stop, check again and that U.S. 50 did not stop. Even with these signs and rumble strips, drivers on U.S. 281 would still pull into the intersection and not realize that traffic in U.S. 50 did not have to stop.
 Those signs are gone now and are replaced with a new speed limit sign and traffic flow signs. Traffic enters the roundabout and turns to the right. Entering drivers have to yield to traffic already in the roundabout.
 Building just a roundabout would have handled regular car, pickup and semi truck traffic. But much oversize load truck traffic uses the intersection, especially wind farm trucks with tower sections and turbine blades. There is not enough room for loads that long to get through a roundabout so the permanent diamond was necessary to accommodate those loads, Mullen said.
 Venture Corporation of Great Bend was the primary contractor for the project and there were 10 subcontractors.
 Work continued on this highway project throughout the pandemic as essential workers put in their time for the public good.
 One might hope that future travelers will be thankful for the sacrifices made by those workers. One life saved from a tragic accident is worth all the investment of state and federal funds, as well as time and labor.

Northern Victorian harness racing is mourning the loss of one of its most dedicated and popular administrators and supporters, with the passing of Bob Watson at the weekend.
 The popular former Cobram club secretary manager lost his battle with cancer and died on Saturday, aged 80 - 12 months after stepping down from his role.
 Bob and his wife Marg were the lynchpins of the energetic little club. Bob, who was "local born and bred" and a life member of the club through his previous involvement as a local studmaster, clerk of course and owner, took up the role as secretary manager "when the club was going through a rough patch".
 He attended the very first Cobram trots meeting in the 1950s with his dad and spent a lifetime around horses. Always "horse mad", over the years Bob was involved in showing and playing polo cross. He was also a harness racing owner, a thoroughbred owner-breeder and held various equine management roles.
 Bob was stud master at Denison Farm (later Eliza Park Stud) for 28 years and he and his wife Margaret set up a thoroughbred agistment property, Rosewood Park at Tocumwal, which they sold only due to Bob's health concerns.
 When Bob took on the Cobram secretary's role he was ably supported by Marg, the "administrative powerhouse" of the team. It was a difficult time for the industry and the Cobram club had only a small member base, limited sponsors and some compelling financial challenges.

But, as we all know, this isn't the first time we've faced an economic crisis. In the 1932 presidential election, Franklin D. Roosevelt decisively beat President Hoover because of the latter's inability to revive the economy in the early years of the Great Depression. Democrats eschewed Hoover's volunteerism and leveraged the power of government to spur an economic revival, passing a landmark domestic preference bill that the lame duck president signed - the Buy American Act of 1933 - and then cleared the way as FDR expanded the federal response to the crisis.

That came in his 34th appearance as a rookie for the Cardinals. He recorded the first save of his career on June 18, 1998, as he gave up one run in two innings in a 7-6 win at Houston over the Astros.
 The JMU product was 0-3 with an ERA of 4.97 in 41 games with eight saves that season.
 Croushore was 3-7, 4.14 in 59 games with three saves in 1999 for St. Louis.
 He split the 2000 season between Colorado and Boston, as he went 2-0, 8.74 in six games for the Rockies and 0-1, 5.79 in five outings for the Red Sox.
 His last MLB outing came October 1, 2000, as he gave up the winning run in the last of the 10th as Tampa Bay won 3-2 over the Red Sox.
 The right-hander was 5-11 with an ERA of 4.88 with 11 saves in 111 games in the majors and also appeared in the minors with the organizations of the Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Reds, Florida Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays. His last pro appearance came in 2003 with the Orioles in the Gulf Coast League.
 Croushore made it to the majors even though he didn't play for a college team the year after he graduated from Mount Vernon High in Fairfax County. That was because he was injured just before his senior year of high school.
 He lived with his mother that year in Texas and took classes at the University of Houston, with an eye on becoming an accountant. Then he was spotted by coaches at Hutchinson, a top program in Kansas.
 "It is funny how things work out," said Croushore, who was born in New Jersey.
 After coaching in Arkansas, where he also played in the minors and met his former wife Tami, Croushore wanted to get into the college game. Last year he met with JMU Coach Marlin Ikenberry about the possibility of being a volunteer.
 "The next day I had lunch with Kevin (Anderson). He said, 'Are you serious about this? Well, my recruiting and pitching coach positions are open. You can have both of them.' Things have worked out," Croushore said.
 The spot opened at Shenandoah after former assistant coach Michael Scimancio became a volunteer assistant coach at Division I Seton Hall in his native New Jersey.
 Templeton, who plans to play for New Market this summer in the Rockingham County Baseball League, said Croushore helped him work on his cutter and other facets of his game. "We definitely did a lot more running," said Templeton, who has played three years for the Hornets.
 The Hornets had an ERA of 4.94 in 12 games this past season while opponents had a mark of 9.10.
 "I could not be more happier," Anderson said of Croushore.

“I feel like (school administrators) have a tremendous amount on their plate just trying to get a feel for how to keep everybody safe, how to bring everybody back, how to cut some costs, how to have an effective budget where we can be competitive but be smart,” Mooney, in his 16th year at UR, said last week. “I support the university’s efforts in a really, really challenging situation that every university is in.”
 John Hardt, UR’s vice president and director of athletics, echoed Mooney’s sentiments in a Sunday email response to a Times-Dispatch inquiry regarding the contract situation.
 “As you can appreciate, with the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial impacts of the economy being turned upside down, and the sweeping protests surrounding the tragic murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and universal demand for social justice, it has been a near steady state of crisis management these past several weeks,” Hardt wrote.
 “Frankly, I really haven't had a meaningful opportunity to review and discuss the basketball program's tremendous progress and success this past season with Coach Mooney due to the abrupt halt to the season and our immediate focus being shifted to the pandemic.”
 Hardt added that he and Mooney are in regular communication and eventually the two will find time to discuss the future of UR basketball. A contract extension often is the reward for a strong year, and a sign of a school's commitment to the program's leader and staff members.
 “Chris embodies the positive characteristics that I value in a head coach, and he does a great job leading the Spider basketball program and supporting our student-athletes,” Hardt wrote. “He understands the University of Richmond and supports our educational values and mission.

Barring any setbacks due to COVID-19 or the weather, Sand Creek Station is set for another exciting summer of championship golf.
   
 The course is set to host four events under the auspices of Central Links Golf (a merger of the Kansas Golf Association and Kansas City Golf Association).
   
 The first will be a Kansas Junior Golf Association Tour event June 23; followed by the Railer, the Kansas Men's Amateur Stroke Play Championships June 26 to 28; a Kansas Men's Amateur Qualifier June 29 and the return of the Kansas Women's Amateur Championships July 13 and 14.
   
 "We're still practicing what's most important, and that's the social distancing," Kemper Sports Regional Manager Chris Tuohey said. "We've been working close with city hall. We've kept our ear to the ground with the county and the county health department. We've been told our efforts are most likely above and beyond what we need to do. We're practicing social distancing, allowing patrons to take one golf cart, so they don't have to sit with someone. We've removed all the rakes. In regards to the championships, and what safety measures we're going to take, we plan to work with Central Links on every single championship. These groups have to abide by the policies set by the Kansas and county health departments. It will be a partnership with the golf association.
   
 "There is still some uncertainty with some details. Will we allow caddies to ride with players? Right now, the cups are flipped upside down so the ball doesn't go in the hole. That's yet to be determined."
   
 Kemper Sports manages the course for the city of Newton.
   
 Tuohey said some of the finer details will be determined by the time the Railer rolls around.
   
 While he said it was a fluid situation and he doesn't know how many could be accommodated, Tuohey expects spectators will be allowed at the events.
   
 "Provided we can provide spectator golf carts, the carts are disinfected from head to toe," he said. "We've been using a chemical has been approved. The carts are doused thoroughly. The restrooms are doused thoroughly. They can come out if they want to watch, but we will be requesting that they follow social distancing guidelines that are still in place."
   
 Tuohey said restrictions for clubhouse use, including the snack bar, will probably remain.
   
 "We're going to allow limited access," Tuohey said. "Given that the clubhouse is only a couple thousand square feet, there won't be allowed a lot of patrons in the clubhouse. That would be throughout the entire year. Once we do allow patrons in the clubhouse, our staff will be wearing face coverings and gloves."
   
 Tuohey said food and beverage service will probably be offered on a carry out basis, but said that's a fluid situation.
   
 "We're now allowing anybody to sit down and eat at this time, but in the coming weeks, we may allow a few patrons at a time," he said. "What's most important is we're abiding by the six-foot spacing."
   
 The course did lose a number of spring tournaments at the high school and college level, including a round of the Bethel Invitational, the Newton High School Boys' Invitational, the Class 5A State Boys' Championships and the Summit League Championships, an NCAA Division I conference tourney.
   
 The KSHSAA announced the Class 5A state boys' tournament will return in 2021.
   
 Tuohey said the Summit League will return next year, and will extend its stay to 2022 with a possibility for 2023.
   
 Tuohey said the course has lost a few corporate outings.
   
 "That's been a melting pot," he said. "We have a few that we will host in the summer, provided we can. We have some that have been moved to the fall. We've had a few events that have been canceled outright, but they plan to hold their events in 2021. It's all over the board. … That did take its toll, but we've seen nice activity with daily fee play. We expect to be back to running competitive events next year."
   
 Tuohey said the course and the city of Newton are close to an agreement with the All-Pro Tour to return to the course this fall. The APT scheduled a tournament for the summer of 2019, but heavy flooding in the area forced cancelation.
   
 "We're happy to have them coming," Tuohey said. "We're in the final stages of locking in an agreement."
   
 He expects that tournament would be held Sept. 15 to 17.
   
 "We want to provide the safest environment possible than anyone else," Tuohey said. "By doing that, we think that is going to provide us with a great reputation in the community. … We're glad golf can provide this safe environment. It can provide an essential activity. And what better place than 176 acres."

Racism exists in the Bow Valley, Alberta and throughout Canada. We don't need chaos south of the border to see it first hand. I've witnessed it right here in town, on Main Street in fact. There's no denying it, we have to be better; from politicians and business owners to tourism operators and athletes. Let's lead by example and show the rest of Alberta that we have no patience for intolerance. I'll continue to listen and learn so that I'm in the best position to help and educate when and where I can.
 The anti-racism rallies that took place in the Bow Valley this past week were a reminder that there's always a groundswell of activism trying to make the world a better place. I'm happy that our Prime Minister marched with protestors in Ottawa, it was a welcomed change to the hiding-in-a-bunker- while-assaulting-peaceful-protestors bumbling racist imbecile who is running the U.S.A. I'm sick and tired, but mostly just angry, that our North American co-habitators elected such a despicable reality TV host to oversee their complex nation.
 Let's continue to motivate our American friends and families to inspire citizens down there to vote on Nov. 3, and to elect anyone other than who's there now. At home, we must continue to protest and stand-up for those who've had a knee on their neck for far too long. That includes all minority and racialized communities in Canada and abroad.
 Of course, that's not everything that's going on these days, we're also dealing with crowds of out-of-towners, a pandemic, road construction, the restart of tourism and the logging of trees along creeks. Large sections of forests have been removed from the mouths of Cougar and Heart Creek.
 The plans have been in the works for some time and will affect access to hiking and climbing areas. Hopefully, all of the flood mitigation efforts work as planned, but some doubt it. Exshaw locals say the recently completed flood mitigation work, which cost upwards of 10 million dollars, has made flooding worse. Politicians even visited to see for themselves how bad the damage was. I wonder if the engineers and planners who ordered trees to be removed know that trees help prevent flooding and landslides? I'm sure they know.
 There's a lot going on but thankfully the parks have reopened so we can escape the chaos to find solitude. And escape we have been. On Friday, there were over 20 skiers on Mount Athabasca's Silverhorn and around 15 on Andromeda's Skyladder. The crags, trails, lakes and summits will be busy this year, so play nice and be safe.
 You could always head north to Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Rockies. It was likely named for Colin Robertson, who worked for the Hudson's Bay Company, but might have been for John Robson, an early premier of B.C. That's ridiculous that we don't even know who it's named after. The Texqakallt First Nation, the area's earliest known inhabitants, called it "Yuh-hai-has-kun" which means "The Mountain of the Spiral Road." Let's just call it that.

The use of nuclear power in space is of interest to the American Nuclear Society (ANS), too, and it will have a session on Thursday at the ANS annual meeting to discuss an update to the society's position paper on the topic. The debate is over using Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) versus Low Enriched Uranium (LEU), which is a serious non-proliferation issue (Jeff Foust wrote a summary in The Space Review of a seminar held last fall about the issue), but one might hope they will also use the opportunity to update their anachronistic use of "manned" and "unmanned" in the existing statement.

The Quinn House is located at 555 Hurricane Shoals Rd. NW in Lawrenceville. It is a Christian ministry for food distribution, clothing/home goods assistance and men’s addiction recovery. It’s been in the community for more than 30 years.
 “Everything we do for people we do for free,” Director of Community Relations Patricia Smokes said. “We’re a licensed food bank. We gave over a million pounds of food last year for free. ... We provide food for the elderly, too. We do over 137 senior donations every month.”
 “We’re a Christian organization and we feel that you’re supposed to clothe and feed the poor and anybody in need. Even if we weren’t Christian, it’s the right thing to do, just to help those around you.”
 But in the last three months or so, as people have lost their jobs because of COVID-19 and the need has increased, the Quinn House’s food pantry has received many new visitors who are in need. The difference between now and before the pandemic is that it’s caused a food shortage with not enough donations coming in to meet the needs of the community.
 Pete Kruck, head of the food ministry, said there’s been about a 40% increase in drive-ups by people who just need food. The Quinn House feeds 10 families three days a week — with 115 pounds worth of food, including a case of water, produce and canned goods.
 “The people coming by are from every walk of life and age — married, single, elderly, homeless,” Kruck said. “There’s no majority. It’s a mix. There’s people who have lost their jobs who normally wouldn’t come to food banks, and we’ve gotten a lot more than before.”

The coronavirus pandemic has not stopped travel on U.S. Highways 281 and 50, but the safety factor of those crossing that infamous intersection near St. John, Kansas has increased. A new $5.2 million roundabout where those highways intersect in Stafford County three miles south of St. John has been completed. After months of work starting in 2019, traffic is flowing smoothly through what had become a controversial project for some.
   
 The new roundabout features an inner circle for regular traffic and a permanent detour outer diamond shape to accommodate oversize loads, said Scott Mullen, Kansas Department of Transportation area engineer.
   
 The roundabout and diamond are designed to prevent the most severe accidents including t-bones and collisions at high speeds. Any collision at the intersection should be under 30 mph, Mullen said.
   
 Tim Potter, KDOT public affairs manager, said roundabouts are used at intersections that have a significant history of crashes and where KDOT has taken steps to mitigate crashes but those efforts were not successful.
   
 In this case, the intersection has a history of injury accidents, fatal accidents and damage to property accidents.
   
 "There is a significant crash history over the years," Potter said.
   
 With the roundabout, any crash would be a glancing blow or sideswipe as opposed to a t-bone or angle crash and at a lower speed.
   
 A roundabout allows traffic to continue moving unless a driver has to yield to other drivers already in the roundabout. All drivers have to reduce speed to enter the roundabout.
   
 Prior to the roundabout, traffic on U.S. 281 was required to stop both north and southbound but traffic in U.S. 50 had no stop signs and no decrease in speed limit.
   
 There were several warnings in place for U.S. 281 drivers including rumble strips and multiple signs, some with lights, warning drivers to stop, check again and that U.S. 50 did not stop. Even with these signs and rumble strips, drivers on U.S. 281 would still pull into the intersection and not realize that traffic in U.S. 50 did not have to stop.
   
 Those signs are gone now and are replaced with a new speed limit sign and traffic flow signs. Traffic enters the roundabout and turns to the right. Entering drivers have to yield to traffic already in the roundabout.
   
 Building just a roundabout would have handled regular car, pickup and semi truck traffic. But much oversize load truck traffic uses the intersection, especially wind farm trucks with tower sections and turbine blades. There is not enough room for loads that long to get through a roundabout so the permanent diamond was necessary to accommodate those loads, Mullen said.
   
 Venture Corporation of Great Bend was the primary contractor for the project and there were 10 subcontractors.
   
 Work continued on this highway project throughout the pandemic as essential workers put in their time for the public good.
   
 One might hope that future travelers will be thankful for the sacrifices made by those workers. One life saved from a tragic accident is worth all the investment of state and federal funds, as well as time and labor.

Noble and others who are calling for changes see a renewed opportunity not just in the widespread protests over the current state of policing, but also in the broad condemnation from within law enforcement of Floyd’s death. Rather than backing the Minneapolis officers’ actions or asking for people to wait for an investigation, police leaders, including PORAC, by and large have swiftly disavowed their tactics.

Courts in the state will not be business as usual when they expand their operations next week.
 Maryland’s district and circuit courthouses have been scheduled by the state’s judiciary to expand operations following 5 p.m. today, Friday, June 5, after the courts close for the day.
 But the general public still will not be allowed to enter the courthouses next week, as has been the case since late March when the state’s top judge issued an order postponing most scheduled hearings and barring public entry into courthouses.
 The St. Mary’s courthouses have only been hearing emergency matters, such as bail reviews and emergency petitions, as well as some “problem-solving” court matters like adult drug court, since that order, leaving a very bare-bones docket with only one judge on duty each day in each courthouse.
 Starting next week, the courts will extend that to plea agreements with sentencing deferred, motions which can be handled without testimony, competency hearings, scheduling conferences and a few other minor matters.
 Remote hearings will still be allowed and preferred, according to the order.
 “All proceedings are conducted remotely whenever possible, using board approved technology,” Anne Arundel Circuit Judge Laura Ripken told the Maryland House Judiciary Committee last Thursday at a meeting discussing the reopening.
 State’s attorneys may also convene grand juries starting Monday, according to the Maryland Judiciary.
 The reopening is part of a five-phase plan by the state’s judiciary to return courthouses to normalcy, with the first phase of the plan being the “skeleton crew” courthouses which are currently in effect. The second phase of that plan begins Monday, and a third phase, where courthouses and their offices will reopen to the general public, is expected to begin on July 20.
 When the public is allowed in, courts will likely continue their current health screening procedures.

“Horrifying scenes and aftermath from selfish LOOTERS who don’t care about this city!!!!!” the tweet’s text says. “.... oh wait sorry. “No, these are pictures from a Kenny Chesney concert tailgate. Whoops.”
 It has since been retweeted nearly 50,000 times.
 Johnson confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that she was told the tweet and the apparent bias it showed were the reasons she would no longer be covering the protests. She declined further comment, deferring to her guild.
 Guild President Michael A. Fuoco, who is also a Post-Gazette reporter, told the AP that guild leaders were “appalled” by the move, and the paper’s editors have not yielded at all in discussions about Johnson’s status.
 “We feel taking a black woman off the most monumental national story about civil rights in the last 50 years is punishment,” Fuoco said. “We have very few black journalists. Someone who has the contacts and the insights for this story, that is what you want.”
 He said of the tweet that he “thought it was clever, I thought it was funny, and I thought it was food for thought. And that’s what we are as journalists. We put things out in the public square.”

"I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot." Hundreds of thousands have hunted in vain across remote corners of the US West for the bronze chest believed to be filled with gold coins, jewelry, and other valuable items. Many quit their jobs to dedicate themselves to the search and others depleted their life savings. At least four people died searching for it. (Someone was getting close last summer.)

The thermometer was rising right along with the sun and the world was awash in a golden green that proclaimed undeniably summertime was finally here! This was the kind of morning that makes all those foggy, soggy, 34-degree mornings of bicycle commuting seem like a small price to pay for a life on two wheels.  
 I stopped for a quick moment high atop Fredericksburg's east hill to snap yet another of the countless photos I have from the very same spot on similarly glorious days. Then I slid my phone back into my jersey pocket and bombed down the hill into town. When I put my foot down at the stop sign in the village square things started to get weird.  
 "John!" said a distinctly female voice from directly behind me. "JOHN!"  
 I twisted around quickly, still in the saddle. There was no one around, save for a pair of bearded old-timers assessing the state of the world over morning coffee at Lem's across the street.  
 "Jooohnnnn!" the voice called again. "Can you hear me, John?"  
 Somebody was messing with me. They were probably leaning out an upstairs window, or sitting behind the tinted glass of a nearby car, or maybe they'd actually planned the whole thing out and planted a speaker in a nearby potted plant or something. I was sure of it!  
 I played along for only a minute, then figured if I was going to be the butt of some "Candid Camera" type spoof, I was going to make the pranksters work a little harder for their laughs. I pushed off and headed toward the post office to drop a letter in the mail, losing the voice momentarily to the throaty rumble of a big diesel pickup as it dragged a dozen ladders and a trailer full of shingles up the hill toward Fryburg. But by the time I'd traveled the two blocks to the post office the voice was back, and more insistent than ever!  
 "John! John? JOOOOHHNNN! Hey John!"  
 This was too much. It's one thing to mess with a man, but entirely another to make him think he's going crazy. I couldn't believe anyone would go to these lengths just to spoof me. My mind ran wild. What had I done to deserve such targeted tomfoolery? Who had I wronged along the way?  
 Just when I was about to rip off my helmet, throw up my hands and shout out surrender right there in the middle of the street I felt a warm pulse of energy on my lower back. My phone!  
 "Joooohhhnnnn!" the voice whined, as I struggled to pull the gadget free from my pocket.  
 "Hello?" I said, obviously flustered. It was my sister, Sandy. My phone had apparently chosen to give her a call when I'd returned it to my pocket after grabbing that quick picture at the top of the hill.  
 "What the heck?" she said. "I've been trying to get a response from you for like 10 minutes! Are you alright?"  
 "Um, yes," I laughed. "Physically I'm just wonderful, but I'll have to admit, you had me a little worried about my mind for a while there!"

More cities lifted curfews on Sunday as nationwide protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd moved into their thirteenth day.
 On Sunday afternoon a crowd of protesters in Washington marched from DuPont Circle to the stretch of 16th Street that now bears a massive mural declaring, "Black Lives Matter." There, protesters participated in a lie-in while chanting, "I can't breathe" -- echoing the words of Floyd as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.
 Protesters in Southern California, many of them Latino, planned to caravan from Compton to the Los Angeles Police Department's headquarters. An organizer said the demonstration was meant to be inclusive and socially distant, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
