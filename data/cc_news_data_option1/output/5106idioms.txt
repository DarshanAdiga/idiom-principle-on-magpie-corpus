In Texas v. White in 1869, post-Civil War, the Supreme Court ruled that Texas entered an “indestructible union” upon admission into the United States, and therefore would remain part of the family. It’s also unclear if other Texans would be on board with such a drastic move.

The left-arm pacer bowled a scorching spell in the morning session as he peppered the opposition batsmen with short-pitched deliveries to create catching opportunities for close-in fielders. Ayaz Tasawar, who was unbeaten on 25, ran out of partners as Zia’s ran through Balochistan’s middle and lower-order. His scalps included Akbar- ur-Rehman (57), Taimur Ali (one), Bismillah Khan (0), Kashif Bhatti (four), Umaid Asif (three), Jalat Khan (0) and Taj Wali (0) as Balochistan were bowled out for 199 after starting the play on 112 for two.

Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE received US regulatory authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, making it the first inoculation against the new coronavirus to get a regulatory green light in the United States.
 The following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has killed 1.59 million people worldwide:
 WHO IS FURTHEST ALONG?
 US drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech are the coronavirus vaccine trailblazers.
 On Nov. 18, they became the first in the world to release full late-stage trial data. Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on Dec. 3, followed by Canada on Dec. 9 and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Dec. 11.
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due to complete its review of the shot by Dec. 29 and India is accelerating its review.
 WHO WILL BE NEXT?
 US pharmaceutical company Moderna is ahead of the pack at this point. It was next to release full data analysis for a late-stage trial on Nov. 30, with its vaccine showing a 94.1 percent efficacy rate. FDA advisers are due to review it on Dec. 17 and the EMA will do so by Jan. 12.
 WHO ELSE IS IN THE RUNNING?
 Britain's AstraZeneca is seeking approval for its vaccine in Britain after announcing interim late-stage trial data on Nov. 23. It had an average efficacy rate of 70 percent and as much as 90 percent for a subgroup of trial participants who got a half dose first, followed by a full dose.
 However, it is not clear how the regulator will deal with the different dosages in the efficacy data in its assessment. While India is conducting an accelerated review, it has asked for more data. AstraZeneca is also in discussions with the EMA, which is conducting a rolling review of the vaccine.
 US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson plans to deliver trial data this year, or early in 2021, teeing it up for US authorization in February if its shot is effective. It reduced the enrollment target for its clinical trial to 40,000 volunteers from 60,000 on Dec. 9, potentially speeding results which are tied to how quickly participants become infected.
 US firm Novavax is running a late-stage trial in Britain with data due in the first quarter of 2021. It expects to start a large-scale trial in the United States this month.
 France's Sanofi and Britain's GlaxoSmithKline, however, announced a setback on Dec. 11 in their attempts to develop a vaccine. The drugmakers said it showed an insufficient immune response in older people in mid-stage trials and that they would start a new study in February.
 WHAT HAPPENS IN THE TRIALS?
 The companies typically test their vaccines against a placebo - typically saline solution - in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of COVID-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot.
 HOW ARE VOLUNTEERS INFECTED?
 The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with COVID-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger a first analysis of their data.
 HOW WELL ARE THE VACCINES SUPPOSED TO WORK?
 The World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70 percent efficacy. The FDA wants at least 50 percent - which means there must be at least twice as many infections among volunteers who received a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. The EMA has said it may accept a lower efficacy level.
 WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA AND CHINA?
 While Pfizer's shot was the first to be rolled out following the publication of full Phase III trial data, Russia and China have been inoculating their citizens for months with several different vaccines still undergoing late- stage trials.
 Russia said on Nov. 24 that its Sputnik V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Institute, was 91.4 percent effective based on interim late-stage trial results. It started vaccinations in August and has inoculated more than 100,000 people so far.
 AstraZeneca said on Dec. 11 that it would test a combination of its vaccine with one of Sputnik V's two components to try to boost the efficacy of the shot it is developing with Oxford University.
 China launched an emergency use programme in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection. It has vaccinated about one million people as of mid-November using at least three shots - two developed by the state-backed China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and one by Sinovac Biotech.
 Sinovac said on Nov. 18 that mid-stage trial results showed its CoronaVac shot triggered a quick immune response and interim data from its late-stage trial could come this year.
 The Butantan Institute, a Brazilian biomedical centre, is producing CoronaVac and aims to make 1 million doses a day ahead of a vaccine campaign to be launched in late January.
 The United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, said on Dec. 9 that one of the CNBG vaccines was 86 percent effective based on interim results from a late-stage trial in the Gulf Arab state.

LAS VEGAS
 Tyler Nevens had 12 carries for a career-high 184 yards, including an explosive 69-yard touchdown burst, and San Jose State overcame its biggest halftime deficit of the season to beat Nevada 30-20 on Friday night and clinch the program's first berth in the Mountain West Conference Championship game.
 San Jose State (6-0, 6-0), which trailed 20-7 at halftime, is off to its best start since the Spartans went 13-0 in 1939 and plays Boise State in the title game on Dec. 18.
 Freshman Shamar Garrett caught the opening kickoff of the second half at the 2, ran up the right hashmark to about the 25 and broke left before racing along the sideline to trim SJSU's deficit to 20-14. On its ensuing drive, the Wolf Pack moved to San Jose State's 1 before, on second-and-goal, Jay Kavika forced a fumble by Toa Taua that was recovered by Jay Lenard. Derrick Deese Jr.'s 5-yard touchdown catch capped a 12-play, 99-yard drive with 2:34 left in the third quarter and Nevens' scoring run gave the Spartans a 27-20 lead about two minutes later.
 Taua had 11 carries for 96 yards for Nevada (6-2, 6-2).
 Junior Cade Hall had 2 1/2 sacks, including a pair on back-to-back plays on Nevada's final offensive possession. The 6-foot-2, 260-pound defensive end has eight sacks this season, tied for eighth most in the country.

 GLENS FALLS – Ronald Clinton Diffee, 72, of Fredella Ave., passed away at his home in Glens Falls, on Wednesday, December 9, 2020. Born on March 22, 1948, in Granville, Ronald was one of 13 children to the late John and Velva (Richards) Diffee.
 Ronald attended school in South Glens Falls and on July 16, 1966, he married his high school sweetheart and soulmate, Jacqueline Mott. They were joined in marriage at the Community Chapel in West Glens Falls and shared 54 wonderful years together.
 Throughout his life, Ronald worked odd jobs, until more recently, he was a self-employed contractor. He specialized in exterior renovations on homes and business. Ronald was a talented handyman who would tackle any job including siding, masonry work and painting. In addition to being a talented contractor, he also loved to cook Italian food, bake pastries and make homemade doughnuts for his family and friends to enjoy.

Sindh were five wickets down and required 65 more runs to avoid an innings defeat when the play resumed on Friday. Saud Shakeel failed to add to his overnight 50 as pacer Irfanullah Shah bowled him. All-rounder Hasan was the only batsman to post a double-digit score for Sindh on the last day of the match. Pacer Mohammad Wasim Jnr was the other notable performer with the ball for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as he bagged three wickets for 37 runs.

The win sets up a semifinal date with cross-county foe Norcross for the rights to advance to the Class AAAAAAA state championship game on Dec. 30.
 “We’re playing well and we’re causing turnovers,” Grayson head coach Adam Carter said. “Jayvian Allen forced three fumbles tonight and we had two picks. Any time you can cause turnovers and get off the field, you feel really good about it. The kids are just playing hard.”
 At halftime, West Forsyth had less than 10 yards of offense. By the midway part of the third quarter, the Wolverines had negative yardage on offense thanks to a top-notch performance from the Grayson front six.
 “That front six that we’ve got right now is just playing at a high level,” Carter said. “It’s been hard for teams to line up and run the ball at us. I just attribute that to the box.”
 While the offensive side of the ball for Grayson wasn’t perfect, it was enough to generate four touchdowns. Jake Garcia tossed two touchdowns through the air and running backs Sean Downer and Joe Taylor each found the end zone once on the ground.
 Carter spoke very highly of both Downer and Taylor for playing at a high level following the devastating injury sustained by Clemson commit Phil Mafah two weeks ago.
 “Nobody is going to replace Phil Mafah and what he brings to the table on offense, but they are doing a lot of really good things and they’re helping us be productive,” Carter said.

"Even Vietnam's recent development has been partially a result of growth in its private debt," he said.
 Kant also said micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) play a crucial role in providing employment but their credit needs are largely unmet by the formal financial sector. "The government is in the process of putting frameworks and protocols in place for credit to be pushed to segments that have largely been untapped," he said.
 Noting that financial inclusion depends on the regulatory environment, Kant said, "While a new business model will be required to fill the current gap in achieving the necessary credit flow, there is a need to change the regulation as and when required." The entire process will require bringing all stakeholders such as banking and industry professionals, together, he added. Kant said the MSME sector will have more credit needs going forward. So, more innovative methods will be the key to meet the demands of the sector, he added.
 He said MSME's credit gap is currently estimated to be Rs 25 lakh crore. Kant also said the government has been pushing faster formalisation of the economy and on credit fronts, the government has taken several key steps.
 According to Kant, the financial sector is undergoing a massive change and there has been a dramatic change in India's credit scenario also. "Over the past few years, there has been a flood of fintech (financial technology) players, which are bringing transformational change in the way financial services are provided," he said.
 Kant also pointed out that the government changed the definition of MSMEs to help the sector.
