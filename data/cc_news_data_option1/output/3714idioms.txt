With the fate of the 87th annual Marysville Stampede up in the air due to current COVID-19 guidelines, organizers conducted an informal, online survey to get feedback from the Yuba-Sutter community to determine the best way to move forward.
 While Nicole Rosser, one of the organizers, said feedback from the survey had not been collected at the time of publication, Stampede organizers plan to use the input to decide whether to move forward with some sort of event this year.
 “Depending on the results and if we move forward, the Stampede will be the same great rodeo, but with proper health and safety precautions in place to keep the spectators and contestants safe,” said Rosser.

Tiago Silva is Nottingham Forest’s only injury absentee for the Sky Bet Championship clash with Cardiff.
 The Portuguese midfielder has been ruled out until the end of September by boss Sabri Lamouchi.
 Winger Joe Lolley has recently been absent due to shin splints but returned to feature in the Reds’ 2-0 loss to QPR last Saturday and will be available again.
 Lamouchi has no further injury concerns, with defender Joe Worrall fully recovered from a knock.

 Midfielder Gavin Whyte has been suffering with a hamstring problem, however, and was sidelined for that game.
 Striker Isaac Vassell has resumed training after a long-term quad injury, but may find the fixture comes too early for a comeback.

“These acts were committed pursuant to two state policies, one to quash opposition to the government and another to combat crime, including by eliminating individuals perceived as criminals,” Valinas told reporters. “We also consider that the documented crimes were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population.”
 “For these reasons, the mission has reasonable grounds to believe that they amount to crimes against humanity,” she said, noting the alleged arbitrary killings and systematic use of torture, in particular.
 Under Article 7 of the UN treaty that established the International Criminal Court, a crime against humanity is defined as an act committed as part of a “widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population.”
 The experts said the violations in Venezuela took place amid a breakdown of democratic institutions, rule of law and judicial independence in the country, often during crackdowns on protesters. They said the “vast majority” of unlawful killings by security forces have not resulted in prosecutions and “at no stage have officials with command responsibility been brought to justice.”
 The report found that members of the Special Action Forces, a feared division of the national police service, and another unit were responsible for over half of the thousands of wrongful deaths that the experts examined. Superiors had authority to grant officers a “green light to kill,” the report’s authors wrote, citing a training video that showed officers being encouraged to “kill criminals without compassion.”
 UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, who traveled to Venezuela last year and met with Maduro, has urged him to dissolve the special forces and to hold the division’s leaders accountable. Her requests have gone ignored.
 The Bolivarian National Intelligence Service, known as SEBIN, was deemed responsible by the rights council experts for politically motivated arrests and torture, targeting dissident voices and human rights activists, the report says.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Many people have been profiteering from the Coronavirus pandemic in Mexico; prices for oxygen cylinders, medicinal alcohol and face masks all have skyrocketed. But perhaps the cruelest are the so-called pirate ambulances that take advantage of patients’ desperation.
 The poorly equipped, often broken-down rattletraps ply Mexico City streets listening to emergency radio dispatch frequencies and race to beat legitimate ambulance services to medical emergencies. They charge patients’ desperate relatives outrageous sums to take them to a hospital, and sometimes even divert them to poorly equipped private clinics from which they receive kickbacks for bringing in business.
 Activists and medical authorities have long complained that they’re not only abusive, but dangerous: Recent inspections have found many of the vehicles operate without sufficient equipment, with untrained personnel and expired medications.

Dance has a language of its own and has the power to communicate so many emotions. While dancing can be therapeutic for many, sometimes even watching someone's beautiful performance can do the trick. This video shared on Instagram fits that definition perfectly.
 Simran Jat, a choreographer from Mumbai, shared this clip in which she can be seen dancing to the soulful track Saibo by singers Shreya Ghoshal and Tochi Raina from the film Shor in the City.
 The dancer shared two clips of her performance to the song - a shorter version as Reels and another longer version. "Finally choreographed something out of my comfort zone. I hope you guys enjoy watching it," she shared as the caption of one of the two videos.
 It's likely you'll watch and re-watch both videos, because that's how amazing the performance is. Take a look:
   
   
 Shared on September 7 and 5 respectively, both videos have collected a huge number of reactions from people on Instagram. While the Reel has collected over 26.8 million views and 9.8 lakh likes, the longer version has received one lakh plus views. Both posts are flooded with appreciative compliments for the dancer-choreographer.
 "Wow you have so much grace in your dance," wrote an individual. "I never danced, but this was so inspiring, it made me groove dil se. Respect," added another.
 "God you're so pretty, TEACH ME DANCE," shared a third. "Literally no words... you're exceptionally talented miss... please never stop dancing, it's meant for you... GEM OF A PERSON!' shared a fourth.
