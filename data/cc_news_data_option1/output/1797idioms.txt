Tanner hasn’t announced any staff pay cuts or any furloughs and, when asked about cutting sports in general, said that’s something that he hopes it doesn’t come to.


  “Everything has to be discussed and considered. Is that something I want to do? Absolutely not; I was probably the first one to jump up and down when seniors and underclassmen got an extra year of eligibility,” Tanner said. “You talk about dollars and cents and you talk about doing the right thing. I would hope we don’t have to do that, but you do have to talk and consider it. You have to look at everything from A to Z and doing things differently to give you an opportunity to be fiscally sound and responsible. Not all schools operate in the black. We’ve been fortunate we fall in that category…Now it’ll be even more challenging. There are a lot of questions that have to be answered. You do talk about money. It’s there; we have to deal with it.

Kathleen has learned to fish just as our grandkids learned, starting with a colorful little rod with a closed-face reel, a bobber and crickets. From there, she graduated to a Zebco rod with a classic “33” reel and Texas-rigged worms.


  But that wasn’t enough. She said it made her look like a child.


  So last week, I dusted off a spinning rod that rarely gets used, an Abu Garcia “Cardinal” road and reel, a pretty white combo that looks a bit feminine. I bought it for my grandson, but he hated it because it was white and looks a bit feminine. It’s now been bequeathed to that woman who fishes with her husband.


  She’s a fast learner. I taught her how to open the bail, hold the line with one finger and casting it high and long and then close bail after letting the worm float to the bottom. I think she caught a bass on her first cast.


  It was strange really. I’ve fished our lake for more five years, always flipping into the shallows, catching them off topwater or baits thrown alongside structure. I never have an off day. That’s simply how you catch fish in our lake.


  Until three days ago.


  I now know that you can cast off the wrong side of the boat, letting the worm fall to the deepest water and do absolutely nothing except haul in 2-pounders cast after cast. I now know that you can absolutely over-think it, that you can give the wily bass too much credit. I now know that there’s another species in our lake besides the largemouth bass and the bluegill bream they feed off of.


  I learned this while almost falling in the water. Twice.


  We’re going to need a bigger boat, but that’s another story.


  So back to the moon. This is a critical week in the natural order of things here in North Carolina. The first full moon of May is when the fish begin to move onto the beds to spawn. Every creature in the ecosystem senses this, and for one week leading up to the moon and one week afterward is a wild show of nature, with millions of eggs and roe and fry suddenly attracting every animal in our world to the beds.

Manchester United assistant coach Michael Carrick has emphasised the importance of players' mental welfare as the club steps up its training programme.


  While the United Kingdom remains in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, discussions are ongoing over the possibility of concluding the Premier League season when it is safe to do so.


  Though bans on professional sport in France and the Netherlands has forced the cancellation of the Ligue 1 and Eredivisie campaigns, the Bundesliga will restart later this month, while LaLiga is aiming for a return to action in June.


  United have now made remote training sessions for players – which were previously optional – compulsory, though Carrick, an assistant to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Old Trafford, acknowledges that the mental health of the players is a priority.


  "Primarily, we're talking about getting back to fitness and playing games but also it's about if they're okay [psychologically]," he said on MUTV.


  "Like all of us, you want to make sure your friends and families are okay. The players are, obviously, part of our family and we want to make sure that, as humans, they're all right and then the sport and lifestyle can come after that.


  "At the start, we left the lads alone [doing their own fitness routines] because we were quite relaxed about it and could probably sense that it could be a good few weeks or months [before the team was back training together].


  "We were conscious of not being too intense with them at the start and then gradually increased it as we go along. As of this week, they're now on compulsory sessions.


  "It's good and we're just desperate to come back. They're looking forward to getting back to what they know best. We're just staying in touch and seeing what's next, like everyone else."


  Carrick added the uncertainty surrounding a potential restart is still an issue, despite the club doing what they can to maintain some form of normality.


  "That's the biggest challenge: not really having a return date," said Carrick.


  "That's why we've tried to gradually increase training and we're just giving ourselves the best chance to be ready, if, and when, we start.


  "It's the same as everyone - it's not just about us and the players; it's about everyone, in every walk of life. Everyone has got jobs to go back to and not knowing is the biggest issue. You can't plan and you're not sure what's next."

I am angry and very, very afraid. I am the mother, and although my children are grown and independent in their own lives, I have always believed and tried to live by my parental responsibility to comfort and educate and protect my children. Now, I cannot reassure my children that their lives will be ok and they will ever return to whatever "normal" was before Feb. 2020.
   
 I can't reassure them because I don't know any longer what normal may be. I live with a degree of fear every time I go out of my house, no matter how short or necessary the errand is. Facial masks hide familiar faces. If there are smiles of greeting, they cannot be seen and voices are often badly muffled. Routine trips to the post office, or to pick up a prepared lunch from the Junction, or perhaps just to find bananas at the local grocery, are all worrisome now.
   
 When I know my children and their loved ones go to their workplaces, I urge them to "stay safe" but in my heart I want them to stay in the better safety of their homes. I hope their work will not take their lives!
   
 All our lives have been turned upside down since February. Remember casually going to the Pig, or IGA or the dollar stores in the old days, without thinking about the need to wear a mask, and perhaps gloves? Remember days and shopping trips when you weren't urged to wipe off the groceries with a disinfectant wipe before putting them away? These days, we are told to wash and wash and wash our hands to the tune of "Happy Birthday" and sing it twice just to be sure they are cleansed. We are warned to socially distance from others, and forbidding duct tape lines greet us everywhere now at checkout counters. In some customer service areas, plastic sheeting hangs from the ceiling with only small openings to accept the money or packages customers bring.
   
 Even as some states begin to open up beaches and parks, movie theaters, bars and restaurants, each such movement comes with a caution. Twenty-five percent of allowable occupancy will be permitted, restaurants are told, although the reality is financial solvency for them cannot not exist at the 25 percent level. Schools will remain closed, with children's lives and learning uprooted indefinitely. The elderly lie alone in nursing homes and hospitals, perhaps to die alone. Yet phenomena are seen in nature as never before - dolphins in Venetian canals and wild animals on city streets.
   
 Some employees may never return to their previous jobs. Some small businesses will fail. But some stores may open if crowds are regulated and socially distanced. Gasoline is at incredibly low cost levels, but car owners are afraid to travel. Airplanes fly sparsely, sometimes with only a handful of passengers. Flight attendants in well-fitted, tailored suits will now be fitted with facial masks.
   
 However, workplace safety goals are merely suggestions for a myriad of building operations and personnel. Meat producers are suffering with high levels of infection within their factories. Sadly, too many employees in too many jobs are not being tested to more accurately determine levels of contagion in the kinds of close quarters often present in factory settings.
   
 Today, experts predicting a second wave with 60-70 percent of the population infected before public immunity is created. They predict a two-year season of illness.
   
 Farmers are dumping milk in their fields, unpicked crops are being plowed under, baby pigs are being euthanized since it is believed there will be no market, and no one truly knows what to do or how long it must be done. Even commercials take a soft touch, promising relief for bill. Families are shown playing together at home and many of these newly-crafted commercials end with the admonition to "stay safe! We're all in this together."
   
 So here we are. Information sources are conflicted and even unreliable. Wear a mask in public, the mayor of Stillwater, Oklahoma directed. Three hours later, after violent protests against employees who were attempting to enforce the regulation originally developed by the CDC, the requirement was softened to a voluntary request. Protesters said the masks were unconstitutional. Armed-for- war with intimidating assault rifles, protesters in Michigan maintained the stay-at-home order was an attack on their freedom, and was not to be accepted or enforced. One sign carried by an angry woman read "My Body, My Choice."
   
 But it isn't only her body; we are all being threatened by invisible droplets of contagion. How can I protect my children against those unseen enemies? How can I tell them everything will be all right in June, or September, or next year when I don't know that answer? Our lives, their lives will never be the same. I am angry and very afraid.

Manchester City's record signing Rodri has been picking the brains of Pep Guardiola as he seeks to get to grips with the Premier League.
 The 23-year-old Spain international has been a mainstay for Guardiola's men since joining City from Atletico Madrid last year, making 39 appearances in all competitions.
 An elegant operator at the base of the midfield, Rodri has chipped in with some valuable goals – most notably a blistering strike from the edge of the box in a 4-1 win at Burnley and header that ultimately proved decisive in the 2-1 EFL Cup final win over Aston Villa.
 However, the former Villarreal player has sometimes appeared ill at ease with the pace of the play around him, with Liverpool storming into a 25-point lead that left them on the brink of ending City's two-season reign as champions when the Premier League went on hiatus.
 Whenever a resumption comes, Rodri feels he is working under the best man to learn and improve.
 "To me, he is the best coach in the world. His success speaks for himself. Everything that he's won with all the clubs he's been at," he said.
 "I have learnt lots of things from him, I couldn't say only one. He has lots of experience as a player and as a coach. It helps me a lot that he played in the same position as me.
 "It's not easy for me as a young player, coming from LaLiga, to fit in the Premier League with such competition, [where it's] so strong physically, with great teams, but it has been an amazing experience this first season.
 "I try to learn every day from him [Guardiola]. He has helped me a lot, especially tactically. It's been the first time I played alone as a holding midfielder, so I have to adapt to the new situation. I'm happy because I fit very well with the team and the club. I feel I'm growing every day."
 When it comes to teething problems in the Premier League, Rodri cites a familiar problem for new imports.
 "It's another style of football. You can't take a breath or relax during the 90 minutes, not even for one second," he said.
 "I realised straight away that in this league you need to think really quickly. I tried to adapt my game in the first games of the season.
 "When I got the pace of the Premier League, I also started adapting my game and my skills to the team.
 "It wasn't easy, because we have lots of attacking players, but we need to defend as well. One of my biggest responsibilities in the team is specifically that part."
 Rodri is playing a role in which Fernandinho has excelled under Guardiola.
 However, form and fitness issues for specialists in the position have left the veteran Brazil international operating exclusively at centre-back this season.
 "He has helped me a lot," Rodri said of Fernandinho. "He is now playing more often as a centre-back so that he can have a bigger picture of the game.
 "He has helped me a lot from the back, [telling me] where to find the spaces.
 "What I learnt the most from him is the experience he has. He's 35 years old, he has been at the club for seven seasons now. So I listen to him a lot and try to learn a lot from him."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — For Californians venturing outside, donning a mask will be as common as putting on a cap or sunglasses when the state begins gradually easing stay-at-home orders on Friday. But rules about face coverings vary from county to county, and it's unclear what enforcement might look like.Masks have been ubiquitous at essential businesses like grocery stores and medical clinics since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. On the sidewalks of dense cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, people have been wearing masks for weeks, giving wide berth to the small number of others whose faces aren't covered.Now masks will be required for customers and employees at certain retailers reopening under new guidelines that also include contact-free transactions, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday.At Sam's, a corner store near San Francisco's City Hall, there are multiple signs reminding patrons to cover their faces, and the clerks have been known to kick out people who don't do so. Some customers will simply lift their T-shirts over their nose and mouth while running in to grab something quick.Mayor London Breed announced city residents must continue to wear face coverings and follow social distance requirements when waiting in line at newly opened businesses like florists or bookstores.Dannie Holzer said she wears a cloth mask most of the time but took it off while eating her lunch at nearby Alamo Square Park, where she was able to keep the required six feet from others.“I wear it because I respect other people, and I don’t know what immune deficiencies they may have,” Holzer said. She got used to wearing masks because she rides public buses, where they are required, on her way to and from her job at a marijuana dispensary.Holzer said she gets frustrated when she is indoors at a store and sees people with their faces uncovered.“I usually think, ‘I’m doing this for your benefit, so it would be nice if you did the same,’ ” Holzer said.Health officials in most of the San Francisco Bay Area — including Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo and Sonoma counties — have required that residents wear masks when they leave their homes. After previously only strongly urging facing coverings, officials in nearby Napa County on Thursday said they would mandate them.Bay Area residents are generally amenable to new rules instituted during the COVID-19 crisis, and deputies have issued very few citations for non-compliance, said Sgt. Ray Kelly of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office.“It’s really hard to write someone a ticket when they just lost their job, when they're living through a time of crisis,” he said. “But if it’s egregious, and you’ve talked to yourself into a ticket, then we have no choice.”Similarly in Los Angeles County, authorities hoped “kindness and compassion” would be enough to convince the “tiny group” of people who aren't complying to don masks, Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said. She urged shop owners to politely refuse service to people without face coverings.On trails around Los Angeles, county employees will be on hand to make sure hikers are wearing masks and maintaining appropriate distance, officials said.To the south in Orange County, masks are recommended but not required. At a strip mall in the city of Westminster, a member of a grocery store cleaning crew had a mask dangling around her neck, not over her mouth and nose, as she offered a shopping cart to a man passing by on Thursday. He also had a mask dangling around his neck.In Northern California, three counties with few confirmed COVID-19 cases allowed a variety of businesses to reopen earlier this week. Not all shoppers wore masks Wednesday at Yuba Sutter Mall, where about 18 of the roughly 50 stores were open.Yuba-Sutter Health Officer Dr. Phuong Luu issued a public warning to businesses to make sure their employees and customers were practicing social distancing and wearing face coverings, as required by the local orders.“I understand that some of your customers may strongly object to a facial covering requirement, but the long-term safety of our community is at stake,” Luu wrote.The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing face coverings that cover the nose and mouth, like T-shirts, bandannas and non-medical masks because the infection can spread from an asymptomatic person simply by speaking.“A simple cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source and not put other people at risk,” the CDC said in an April statement. “The mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment.”At the park in San Francisco, Dannie Holzer said while non-mask-wearers frustrate her, she stops short of calling people out.“I can’t be the person who tells people what to do,” she said.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Abby Police Found Stamp Collection Owner - Bags Found In Bush By Good Samaritan

The full moon marks the start of the seasonal spawn and my personal hiatus from fishing. Some people love bass and bream roe, or “poor man’s caviar.” And some people love catching bass off the beds, which known as “sight fishing” but in reality is cradle robbing the bass at a vulnerable time in life.


  So there we were, three days before the Flower Moon and trolling toward the dam, where a large drain tower sits in the deepest past of the lake. It’s close enough to the dam that people fish it from the shore, always leaving lures and various baits snagged in the drain, which is where I’ve found many a lure over the years.


  True to form, I saw a bright blue finesse worm, still Texas rigged with a bullet weight on its nose. I stood in our little jon boat and tried to retrieve it but almost fell in the water. The first time.


  I handed the worm to Kathleen, who mentioned how “pretty” it was. I rolled my eyes and tied it to her pretty white combo, and off we went.


  The rest of the evening was an education. Not for that woman who fishes with her husband, but her husband.


  She caught fish after fish with a pretty blue worm, a color I have never in my life tossed into our lake. She was still catching them when I threw my topwater Pop-R into a low-hanging tree limb and had to go in after it.


  I was not practicing good boating skills, risking life and limb for a $5 lure, losing my balance and falling half into the boat just as Kathleen squealed then she was stuck. She wasn’t. Her line was moving. She’d caught another fish while I was trying to kill myself.


  She squealed louder as she reeled it in, a bigger fish than I’d seen in a while, an odd shaped, distinctly colored fish I had only seen once in my lake.


  She’d caught a crappie.


  The evening was complete. It’s a new dawn now. I’ve learned more about our lake in one hour than I’d learned in five years.


  In the midst of a COVID-19 lockdown, three days before the Flower Moon and the spawning of a new population of fish, we had an adventure we’ll talk about forever. Tonight, we’ll watch the super moon rise over our little lake and realize yet again that in this horrible time on earth, the earth itself is restoring, restocking and reminding us all that she’ll reveal her secrets to us in her own way and in her own time.


  The lake belongs to the fish and fowl again. At least for a few days, the bass, the bream and yes, the crappie, will swim free and raise their own.


  The pretty little rod sits against a wall in the fishing room, a pretty little blue worm dangling from the tip.

And it’s truly truly just giving. Its something they can take home as a reminder.”Hundreds and hundreds of individual bouquets draped the six-foot wall. It was long enough to just about get all of your steps on your pedometer in for the day. Many marveled saying it was a work of art that these healthcare workers get to take home with them.“It has been absolutely overwhelming to see the outpouring of love and support that the community has shown for our teammates.” said Vicki Block with Atrium.It wasn’t as easy as just walking up and grabbing one of the 600 flowers off the wall, as there seemed to be a science to it. Some took from the front straight away. “Because it’s the most beautiful one.” said one nurse as she grabbed one of the first bouquets on the wall. Others walked the entire length before picking out just the right one.And it wasn’t just happening at Atrium Health. The same event was going on over at Novant Health as well at the same time.Copyright 2020 WBTV. All rights reserved.

CARVER - After weeks of strategizing potential plans and setting target dates for getting the 2020 spring season underway, it was finally set in stone: the season, and the remainder of the academic year, would fall victim to the wide- spread impact of the coronavirus pandemic.


  "I was looking forward to a condensed season, and when we got the news, my first gut reaction was sadness for all the kids, especially the seniors," girls track and field coach Sean Carey said.


  When news about delaying the start of the season hit around early to mid- March, a condensed season was the best case scenario, but with so much about the virus unknown, the best course of action was to scrap it all together.


  "At first, like everyone, you had hope that this wasn't going to go on forever and we'd have a shortened season, but after two or three weeks, the way things were headed, and we hadn't even come close to coming back at the beginning of April, to be honest, the writing was on the wall," boys tennis coach Roger King said.


  The senior class has gone through a lot in recent weeks, like not having the opportunity to close out their high school lives at the physical school, but they will all have to live with the "what if" of thinking about their final season.


  The news hit hard for the softball team in particular because they felt like their stars would align ahead of highly anticipated team success. The team didn't have a senior a season ago and was slated to have six this year.


  "It should've been the best season yet. I was really looking forward to seeing how much noise we were going to make with everyone coming back. It was kind of a bummer. We were hoping to make some noise and make it further in the tournament," softball coach Tony Rota said, wishing he could have one more season with this current group of seniors. Olivia Camelo, Shay Martin, Jacey Ruzzano, Morgan Campbell, Beth Stagnitta, and Ari Hunter were set to do some damage this spring.


  Girls track was also looking forward to capping off its seniors' high school careers on the right note.


  "The kids knew we were going to have a great season. I know they were frustrated that they couldn't show what they could do. My heart burns for these kids. They put a lot of time and hard work into it and for this to happen to them, it's a tough pill to swallow," Carey said.


  Jordan Turner, Bella Asam, Charlotte McElroy, and Emma Simmons were ready to represent Carver on the track one last time, but now they won't have that chance. Carey was looking forward to what their senior seasons had in store.


  He continued, "Jordan is hands-down the best all-around track athlete Carver has ever had, and that's saying a lot because there have been a lot of strong girls. She was absolutely going to kill it this spring, no doubt. Bella Asam, she was really coming on strong at the end of the winter in the jumps, I could put Bella in any race and she would do very well. Charlotte, same thing, she was ready to break out for another great spring herself in the sprints, she really helps us out with the throws and the javelin. Emma is coming off a great basketball season and she always is the top javelin thrower in the league. I feel for Emma too. I was glad she was able to finish her basketball season. I know that's her love. They're going to be irreplaceable in the future."


  For boys tennis, King wanted to see how his team was going to shape up. He had a mix of new sign-ups and perennial players that he was expecting to see a lot of growth from.


  "It would've been Luke Gregory, Chase Carey was going to be in strong contention for the top player this year, the Diogenes twins - Alex and Ben would've had great years. Jacob Wilkins would've had, I think, a really good season. Just talking to the kids this week, hopefully if things start to lighten up, hopefully we'll be able to get together as a team and have a little bit of an outing. I would love to do something as a team within a month or two before they all go their separate ways for college and everything, if we can," King said.


  The virus has left every spring athlete feeling like they have some unfinished business. The 2020 season is abandoned for good reason. It's a somber time, the virus has affected everyone in some capacity. It's important that everyone stays healthy at this time, and leaving the 2020 spring season at bay is the best way to do that.
