When "Bad Boys," the cop-buddy film directed by Hollywood bad boy Michael Bay, and starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, was released 25 years ago, it took in just over $141 million at the box office. When "Bad Boys II," with the same directing-acting combo came out 17 years ago, ticket sales were $273 million. I didn't see either of those films until a week ago, when I sat down for a double feature on my living room couch.      And I liked them! A lot!! It was easy to see why they were such big hits. Both featured boatloads of action, breakneck editing, gobs of handleable violence, a steady thread of humor, snappy banter, a lush and richly saturated color scheme, and a believable and loving camaraderie between the two leads.      Over the years, I had also become - with the exception of his dizzyingly unwatchable "Transformers" films - an unabashed fan of Michael Bay. When I discovered he wasn't directing "Bad Boys for Life," and that it would be co- directed by the unfamiliar (to me) Adil El Arbi and Bilail Fallah, I had some negative thoughts.      But 10 minutes into it, and already caught up by all of the action, fast editing, violence, humor, camaraderie, etc., I knew I was in good hands. About 20 minutes later, when Michael Bay had a cameo as a wedding emcee, and I realized he had given the film his blessing (and later found out he produced it), I was settled in for the ride.      In fact, it opens with a ride - a wild one, with Mike Lowrey (Smith) at the wheel of his Porsche, zigzagging through a high-speed police chase in Miami, with his partner Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) in the passenger seat, screaming for him to slow down. But it turns out not to be a chase. It's a high-speed ride to a hospital, where Marcus' daughter is giving birth to his first grandson.      And so begins the story of what appears to be the dissolution of the partnership. Mike and Marcus have been together all these years, but now Marcus is considering retirement "because family is all that matters." To which Mike, with no thoughts of retirement, replies, "I'll be running down criminals till I'm 100!"      Meanwhile, somewhere in Mexico, there's a bloody jailbreak, a reunion of a vindictive mother and her murderous son, and a vengeful plan that includes making Mike the target of some bullets. With that plotline in play, it's safe to say that retirement is at least temporarily put on the backburner.      There's some dark, serious stuff going on here, but the writers and directors make sure to include a fair share of fun in the mix, and there's some funny crosscutting between action-man Mike still keeping up his old lifestyle and old-fashioned family man Marcus settling into his new one. To clarify, Mike wants revenge on those who tried to off him, and Marcus wants to enjoy life with his grandson.      Joe Pantoliano returns for his third portrayal of the overly excitable Captain Howard, a man who regularly needs a swig of Pepto Bismol whenever Mike goes rogue on him. Series newcomers Paola Nuñez, as the head of a special police team, and Kate del Castillo and Jacob Scipio, as the malevolent mother-son duo, are perfectly cast. But as with the first two entries, it's the onscreen relationship between Smith and Lawrence, the peanut butter and jelly of cop- buddy movies (that's a compliment), that makes the film work.      Their characters are similar in that they're committed to their jobs. They're different because ... well, Mike drives that Porsche, and Marcus drives his wife's Nissan Quest. The nice thing about them playing these action roles again after all this time is that they're convincing as a couple of guys who are too long in the tooth to do it, but can still do it. Will there be a "Bad Boys 4?" The script makes it feasible, but let's see how well this one does at the box office (my guess is very well).      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now.

Cobra’s debut ended in true style as we saw London – and the entire country – suffer a major blackout following the fall-out of the solar flare. Lights, electricity, everything disappeared in the blink of an eye in a truly stunning final shot.

As if her impressive shape wear wasn't enough to get fans on board with Skims, her new cozy line definitely is. It's definitely a bit pricy, but how cute does Kim look in this all-black set with matching robe, strolling onto set?

Even though she doesn't always agree with the off the wall things he says, there's no doubt that Kim is Kanye's biggest fan, especially when it comes to his clothing line. She's always repping his stuff -- and it makes sense, because she looks good doing it.

Forty years ago next month, the Adirondack village of Lake Placid in upper New York State hosted the 13th Olympic Winter Games. The heroics of the U.S. men's hockey team's improbable win over the Russians and speed skater Eric Heiden's five gold medals made the 1980 games one for the ages.      Starting Feb. 14, the Lake Placid community will celebrate its legacy by hosting a full slate of activities that embody the Olympic spirit by re- creating the opening ceremony and torch lighting as well as skiing events with Olympic athletes.      As the site of North America's first winter Olympics, in 1932, Lake Placid is one of only three cities worldwide to have hosted two Olympic Winter Games. Since then it has played host to annual winter world championship events and other large-scale sporting competitions.      This small village of 3,400 has an unmatched Olympic legacy. It has sent at least one athlete to every winter games and in total has sent more than l00 athletes to compete since the first modern winter games in l924. The original rinks from l932 and 1980 seat 2,600 and 8,500 people for events.      Visitors can experience the glory and excitement of the Olympics by touring the Olympic complex and museum. In the building where the 1980 hockey game took place, the museum features videos, interactive displays, graphics and historic artifacts. It's fascinating to relive one of the greatest sports moments of the 20th century while watching original footage of the game.      It was here that 20-year-old Sonja Henie won the gold medal in l932 and charmed the world. She helped transform ice skating into entertainment art. Herb Brooks Arena, named for the coach of the 1980 gold medal U.S. hockey team, hosts skating competitions and Saturday night ice shows.      The museum, open l0 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, is on Main Street next to the arena. Entrance is free with an Olympic Sites Passport available at the Olympic Center box office.      1980 was an extraordinary year for U.S. athletes, and Lake Placid was at the center of it all. The eyes of the world were on the hockey game that will always be remembered as the "Miracle on Ice." The U.S victory rallied the entire nation as the U.S. team managed to defeat the best teams in the world. The U.S. team was a group of college players who had only been practicing together for six months. They beat the Soviets 4-3 and Finland 4-2 in the exciting final to capture the gold medal.      Preservation is a key museum core value. The original jackets, hockey sticks and other equipment of the players are displayed. Henie's costumes and skates are also on view.      Anniversary activities kick off with the opening ceremony Feb. 14. The torch run by 1980 Games torchbearers and local athletes will be followed by the 1980 Olympic cauldron lighting. Other events include:   • A meet and greet with medalist Dan Jansen.   • Learning the biathlon, curling and luge from athletes and coaches.   • Screening of the Disney movie "Miracle on Ice" at the Palace Theatre.   • Cross-country or downhill skiing.   • A 1980s Family Fun Party at the Olympic Ski Jumping Complex.   • A Fun Zone is scheduled each day between 4 and 6 p.m. on Main Street, where visitors can enjoy hot chocolate, s'mores and games. Restaurants, bars and shops will get in the spirit with live music and events.   Lake Placid is a five-hour drive north of New York City. For information, visit lakeplacid.com.

That thousand yard stare says it all. It's so often that we see Meghan smile, but her frowns get lost in a sea of royal madness. We don't blame Meghan at all for her departure -- it's about time we stop expecting royals to smile all the time.
