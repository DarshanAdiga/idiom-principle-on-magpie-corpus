Asked about McIlroy's comments, he said: "A lot of them (golfers) are very political, actually. A lot of them like my politics very much and some don't, I guess.


  "The ones that don't I don't get to see as much."


  World number one McIlroy teamed up with Dustin Johnson against Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff in Sunday's charity event at Seminole Golf Club.


  McIlroy and Johnson won by claiming a 1.1 million dollar (€1million) skin through a nearest-the-pin challenge on a par-three tiebreaker hole, as McIlroy hit his tee shot to within 10 feet.


  The pair raised 2,075,000 dollars (€1.9m), Fowler and Wolff ended with 1,150,000 dollars (€1m). Adding in viewer donations, the event raised 5,503,959 dollars (€5m).


  Trump also said it was "wonderful" to be watching the likes of McIlroy playing golf again as the US President underlined the importance of getting sport back quickly for the "psyche" of the nation.


  The sporting calendar has been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus pandemic in recent months, but events are slowly beginning to return across the world.

Editor's note: While Harold Bubil takes some time off, we'll reprise some of his popular columns. This column originally ran on July 20, 1996.
   
 For centuries, the world has praised the "Mona Lisa" as an ideal of beauty.
   
 But I don't know, I think the old girl is looking a little dated. The plain hair, the boring clothes, the stiff demeanor. I mean, she never really smiles; she just sits there with that smug grin.
   
 And she could lose a few pounds, too. Maybe a personal trainer could firm her up a bit. After all, muscles look good on a woman; just look at those Olympians!
   
 Let's face it, if Mona is going to be a '90s Woman, she needs a makeover. I'm sure we can find a painter to touch her up a bit. Da Vinci will roll in his grave, but, hey, it's not his painting anymore, now is it?
   
 What's that, you say? Unthinkable? Works of art shouldn't be touched?
   
 Oh, I agree.
   
 So how do we explain how we treat our architectural works of art, particularly the houses and buildings designed by masters of the modernist Sarasota school of architecture in the 1940s, '50s and '60s?
   
 Many of them have been torn down, or remodeled beyond recognition. Witness the stuccoed-over optical shop on U.S. 41 at Browning Street that formerly was the striking, glass-walled Galloway's furniture store.
   
 One outstanding example, Sarasota High School's "new building," is barely visible from the road anymore, hidden behind a mess of vegetation that has been allowed to grow tall from the banks of a creek.
   
 Still others still have fallen into disrepair. We wouldn't let that happen to the Mona Lisa, now would we? Nor would we add on a few more square feet of canvas just to make her fit a wall better.
   
 Now I realize that the design of buildings and their subsequent occupancy can be at cross purposes. Buildings are primarily functional, that function being to serve the needs of the occupants. And as those needs change, sometimes the buildings must be changed. That, however, can be done respectfully.
   
 Some of our local Sarasota school treasures have been tastefully remodeled, and still others have been preserved almost untouched over the decades. In the Sunday Real Estate section of the Herald-Tribune, we pay tribute to homes that have survived changing times.
   
 Unfortunately, many of the residences designed by such masters as Paul Rudolph (also known for designing Riverview High and Sarasota High's addition), Victor Lundy (who did St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Sarasota) and Jack West (Sarasota City Hall) have fallen victim to market forces.
   
 Built as simple beach houses, the homes occupied prime waterfront property that became so valuable in recent years that the owners saw more sense in replacing them with mansions. In the new order, the old houses, spare of ornamentation and short on space, had to go.
   
 But not all of them. Some owners, appreciative of their live-in art, have kept the houses as they were built, with clean, purposeful lines. They recognize that simplicity can be beautiful.
   
 Just like the "Mona Lisa."

Often, it takes a national crisis to expose the systemic flaws of society's most trusted systems. We have seen the nation's food supply chain collapse as a result of this pandemic, but it has really exposed more about the American psychology about agriculture and what eat or, more, want to eat.
 Americans suffer from the most costly and greatest occurrence of the major leading causes of death than any other nation on the planet. We have high incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity and these are all caused from a diet of affluence, or what is called the Western diet by T Colin Campbell, PhD, and Thomas M. Campbell II, M.D, authors of The China Study. Over decades of research and study of nutrition by these two scientists with rats and now human subjects, in conjunction with other physicians, they have found that the typical Western diet of animal protein, dairy products and sugar consumption has led to the failing health of Americans.
 Let's look at dairy products to start. Milk was frankly never meant for human consumption. The milk produced by the human mother contains approximately 5-6% protein, exactly the right amount for the new infant. This mother's milk contains the exact amount of macronutrients and has a 35% fat content, much higher that what is recommended once the infant reaches three years of age. This fat content is important because the infant is growing at enormous rates. Once weaned, children should not consume cow's milk. Why? Because cow's milk contains a cancer-causing protein called Casein, and it represents about 87% of the content of cow's milk.
 Consider cell replication. It is great to have healthy growth for our youth, but do we want healthy cell replication growth? Not really. Drinking cow's milk introduces this very protein into our bodies, and Campbell's decades worth research on rats indicated a direct correlation of introducing the Casein protein and cancer development.
 What about meat products? According to Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn Jr., M.D., the leading cause of heart disease in consuming animal protein. He says, "You graduate from high school in this country, you get a diploma and you also get the foundation for coronary heart disease," all based on the Western diet consumed by Americans.
 We like to blame this condition on genetics, but frankly, Esselstyn has improved and reversed heart disease by simply putting patients on a whole food plant based diet. Even those patients with multiple surgeries, stents and deemed the end of the line patients, with strict dietary changes, their coronary heart disease was reversed.
 So what does this say about how our government communicates to the public about what our dietary requirements should be? Not much. Even our medical community does not get much more than 25% nutritional education throughout their entire physician training. And, big corporations stack governmental boards with so called scientists designed to influence standards about what gets sold to the American public, thereby influencing farmers about what they should produce, or more likely what will be paid for.
 So large cereal companies advocate for higher sugar standards to the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) which is part of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and is responsible for reviewing and updating recommended consumption of individual nutrients. The American Dairy Association, one of the most influential lobbying organizations in government makes sure that school kids are assured of getting two containers of cow's milk daily. And if it looks like milk consumption is waning, they conduct expansive ad campaigns like "Got milk?"
 The Live Stock Association, also one of the most powerful lobby groups, makes sure the supply chains are full through its corporate farms (whether that be beef, pork, lamb, chicken or any other animal protein source) and if that is threatened, the president of the United States opens up that food chain by executive order. This agricultural structure and the substance of it is literally killing Americans through the manifestation of disease incidence.
 It is time to rethink our entire food system. We need small farms that feed PEOPLE, a more whole food plant based diet, better knowledge of what animal based protein and dairy is doing to the human body and better environment practices if we are going to succeed. This is something we will be forced to examine after this pandemic is over.

BENGALURU - Staging football matches without spectators must only be a short- term fix during the COVID-19 pandemic as the prolonged absence of fans could damage the game, former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has said.


  The German Bundesliga became the first major soccer league to resume since the novel coronavirus outbreak shut down sports earlier this year, and its return behind closed doors is being closely watched by other leagues.


  “Will it survive long-term? Will it damage the show long-term without supporters? I am convinced of that,” Fifa’s head of global development Wenger told beIN Sport.


  “You cannot imagine a whole season without any spectators. That’s why I believe it a short-term solution.


  “It is still the best possible way to get a verdict for the end of the season. It’s better than any other decision.”


  England’s Premier League is hopeful ‘Project Restart’, which envisages a return to action in June, can gain momentum after clubs hold a conference call on Monday to vote on a return to group training but matches will be played in empty stadiums.


  The Frenchman added that health concerns should take priority in any decision to restart play.


  “We can’t be guided too much by financial reasons and take such a big gamble,” he added. “We have to first make sure this is medically safe.”

A pair of Air Jordan sneakers worn in a game by Michael Jordan sold Sunday for $560,000 at Sotheby's auction house, an all-time record for basketball shoes. The white, black and red shoes, made for Jordan in 1985 and autographed by the NBA legend himself, dethroned the reigning "Moon Shoe," one of Nike's first sneakers, a pair of which sold in July 2019 for $437,000, also at Sotheby's. The latest sale highlighted the soaring market value of objects identified with the retired basketball superstar since the release of "The Last Dance," an ESPN/Netflix documentary that chronicles the saga of Jordan and his Chicago Bulls.


  It also confirms that the lowly sneaker now has a place of pride in the world of wealthy collectors alongside more traditional collectibles.


  The pair of Air Jordan 1's in the "Chicago" color scheme, the most emblematic model of its generation, easily surpassed Sotheby's pre-sale estimate of $100,000-$150,000.


  The Air Jordan 1 is the first model specially created by Nike for Michael Jordan, who wore them in his first season in the NBA.


  "I think the game-worn Air Jordan 1's are the most iconic sneakers of all time," the seller, collector Jordan Geller, told AFP at the start of the sale.


  "They are so recognizable and they conjure up so much nostalgia, which I think gives them a very special appeal. The fact that these shoes were game- worn by Michael Jordan takes them to a whole other level," he said.


  Unlike the Air Jordan 1's, the "Moon Shoes" sold last year had never been worn.


  Before Sunday's sale, the record for athletic shoes worn by an athlete was held by the leather-soled running shoes in which Britain's Roger Bannister became the first person ever to run a mile in less than four minutes, in 1954.


  They were bought for $409,000 by an anonymous collector in 2015 at auction at Christie's in London.

The third season of Justin Willman's "Magic for Humans" arrived Friday on Netflix, and it may be just the trick to elevate quarantined viewers' spirits.
 Willman says the timing of the new season is a blessing when people need it. "Right now people are craving escapism, wanting something to watch and feel good about, something you can watch with your grandmother and kids."
 The series blends magic, comedy and social experiments without the use of CGI or camera tricks. The seven new episodes were filmed in 2019 and will explore themes of fear, self-care, tradition, vices and more.
 Willman, 39, typically would've spent the past couple of months promoting "Magic for Humans" on talk shows. Instead, he's at home in Los Angeles with his wife, Jill Sipkins, and their 1½-year-old son, Jackson.
 Even from home, though, he's busy promoting his show.
 "I'm playing to the new medium and still blowing minds within these limitations and challenges and coming up with creative strokes," he says. "We were thrown a curveball, but it's a curveball we're able to handle."
 Being in quarantine, he says, has been a shock to the system. He had been scheduled to be on his "Magic in Real Life" tour, "and all in the course of a week, everything slowed to a halt."
 "It's super sad, but I'm trying to find the silver lining - trying to make the best of it."
 Willman has been enjoying spending time with his son, who appears with him in a series of occasional videos on social media. Jackson unwittingly spoils his dad's "Quarantined Magic Lessons."
 "He's at an age where everything is magic to him - he's a funny straight man," Willman says. "I've discovered he has a pretty amazing comic timing, busting me on my tricks. People are finding it very funny. I found its comedic angle truly by accident.
 "I'm looking forward to showing it to him when he's older. He'll probably roll his eyes at me."
 Willman hopes to inspire other young magicians with his Social Distancing Magician Starter Kit.
 "I always wanted to make a magic kit and put it out there," says Willman. As a youngster, he was disappointed with the quality of the magic kits that were available. Back then, he became interested in magic after breaking both arms in a fall (from a bike, while wearing rollerblades). During his recovery, he felt isolated.
 "This was my chance," he says. "I've got time now, so I said, 'Let's create that magic kit.' We're all stuck in our homes feeling helpless.
 "The response has been great. A lot of parents are getting it for their kids, but they're also getting it for themselves. Some of the parents always liked magic but never had a chance to do it."
 Proceeds from the kits ($49 at justinwillman.com) go to DirectRelief.org, a COVID-19 relief fund, and the End Alz Association's efforts in the Alzheimer's community, which is being hit disproportionately by the pandemic.
 Willman's mother, Sonja Willman, has Alzheimer's. The final episode of season two of "Magic for Humans" addressed her recent diagnosis.
 Willman says the pandemic will cause viewers to see elements of the series through a different lens. In a recurring segment called "Close-Up Magic," he approaches strangers and leans in so close that their noses nearly touch. "'Hey, you wanna see some close-up magic?'" he asks them. "And I do the trick right to their noses. With social distancing, it now takes on an element of danger we didn't expect."
 Another episode finds Willman performing magic at a nudist colony - where he's also naked.
 "It may sound scandalous on the surface," he says, but the episode includes a lot of blurred scenes. The episode plays to his fear of being onstage without clothes.
 "As a magician, it takes on an extra layer. I need pockets - places to put my stuff. I need my props. In the fear episode, I pick five of my real-life fears and face them head-on."
 In season three, he also lampoons influencer culture, levitates at a car wash and talks to kindergartners about their bucket lists.
 When "Magic for Humans" launched in 2018 - he says it was Netflix's first magic show - he was able to do what he wanted without first submitting a pilot.
 "Netflix got out of my way, but I didn't want to get my hopes up," he says. "It's so easy to work hard and put something out there, and then it disappears into the ether. I've learned to manage my expectations. I made a show I was proud of, and whatever happens happens.
 "The fact that season three is coming out is so surreal. Making three seasons is a huge win."
 Videos from the show have been viewed more than 150 million times on social media.
 Willman, whose first magic and comedy special was "Sleight of Mouth" in 2015 on Comedy Central, is astounded by the success of "Magic for Humans."
 "You don't realize the reach of a streaming platform like Netflix that goes around the world, where people don't have to wait for a specific time to see a show," he says. "Every day is like a premiere day when someone sees your show. You're in their living room, and you're making them smile - entertaining them."
 From 2009 to 2013, Willman hosted "Cupcake Wars" on Food Network and has seen his fan base grow as a result of "Magic for Humans."
 "When I meet people on the road, they really feel like they know me," he says. "I didn't expect that."
 And he says the show has evolved to become more personal. He has lowered the guard he had up during Season 1.
 As much as Willman loves the series, he's eager to get back on the road to perform for fans in person, his favorite part of his career. The new tour dates are now scheduled to run August to November.
 "Hopefully that sticks," he says. "We're all playing it day-by-day. But fans have been really understanding and eager to see it happen when it happens.
 "I'm eager to get back out. The TV show is a passion, but the goal is to create new fans to entertain in packed theaters. I feel I'll come back better than ever with even more gusto."
