Lockdown and stay-at-home orders left many people feeling bored and out of sorts. With people out of work, working from home, or temporarily taking time off from their jobs, it was essential that they found a way to pass the time while stuck inside. During the peak of the pandemic, many restaurants, bars and other venues were closed to the public leaving individuals with little to do in terms of fun and entertainment. So it’s no surprise that online gambling grew in popularity as people searched for something fun to do that was safe to do from home.

DXY stays on the defensive at the end of the week near 93.70. US Retail Sales surprised to the upside in September. Advanced Consumer Sentiment gauge closes the weekly docket. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the buck vs. a basket of its main rivals, remains on the defensive so far on Friday. US Dollar Index looks to extra data Despite the current corrective downside, the index is expected to close the week with gains and reverse the 2-week negative streak. So far, it seems the 93.00 neighbourhood has emerged as quite a solid contention area, whereas the 94.00 region looks a tough nut to crack for USD-bulls for the time being. Meanwhile in the US, discussions over an extra stimulus package remain deadlocked at the time when investors have started to rule out any new development around this issue at least until the November elections have passed. Focus, in the meantime, is expected to shift to the relentless advance of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the already incipient economic recovery across the world. In the US data space, Retail Sales expanded 1.9% MoM in September, more than initially estimated. Core sales followed suit and rose beyond forecasts by 1.5% MoM. Additional data saw Industrial Production unexpectedly contracting at a monthly 0.6% in September, while Manufacturing Production also came in on the soft side, shrinking 0.3% from a month earlier. Capacity Utilization also came in short of estimates, ticking lower to 71.5% during the same period. Further data will include the advanced reading of the Consumer Sentiment for the current month as well as TIC Flows in August. Furthermore, NY Fed J.Williams (permanent voter, centrist) is also due to speak. What to look for around USD The index stays so far supported by the 93.000 area against the backdrop of alternating risk appetite trends. Occasional bullish attempts, however, are seen as temporary, as the underlying sentiment towards the greenback remains cautious-to-bearish. This view is reinforced by the "lower for longer" stance from the Federal Reserve, hopes of a strong recovery in the global economy, the negative position in the speculative community and rising bets of a "blue wave" win at the November elections. Developments around another US stimulus package also collaborate with the vigilant stance around the buck. US Dollar Index relevant levels At the moment, the index is losing 0.17% at 93.62 and faces immediate contention at 93.01 (monthly low Oct.12) followed by 92.70 (weekly low Sep.10) and then 91.92 (23.6% Fibo of the 2017-2018 drop). On the other hand, a break above 94.20 (38.2% Fibo retracement of the 2017-2018 drop) would aim for 94.74 (monthly high Sep.25) and finally 96.03 (50% Fibo of the 2017-2018 drop).

You can start managing your insurance costs by working on your policy options. Deductibles are one factor that can affect your premium. Thus, increasing deductibles means that you will save a lot of money on different types of insurance policies. You can also change the coverage limits in order to save more money. Another way to go about this is to speak with an insurance agent and ask them how policy changes can affect insurance costs and what you can do to reduce them. In any case, your efforts should aim at reducing insurance costs in order to make more profit and using the necessary insurance coverage for your business.

“Since the government does not control the entire territory and does not always have the capital necessary for the development of the sector, it has been replaced by armed groups who enforce their own laws. Sometimes these are even Congolese soldiers,” explains Fidel Bafilemba, researcher and coordinator for GATT-RN (Support Platform for Traceability and Transparency in the Management of Natural Resources). The military’s involvement in trafficking may come as a surprise at first glance but it is explained by the weakness of the state: unable to pay its soldiers properly, the powers that be turn a blind eye to misconduct. Given these conditions, Bafilemba believes it would be difficult to put an end to child labour.
