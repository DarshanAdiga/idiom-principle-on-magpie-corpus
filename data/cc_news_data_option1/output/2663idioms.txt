I think the point of this is to prevent blank promises which are often used to manipulate people. But this is where I’ll argue we should replace excessive boundaries with a critical assessment of character. Manipulative tactics like “future faking” are easy to spot once you learn the signs.

Mr Carmichael said: ____“Across the country and in the isles people are struggling to make ends meet because of the impact of the pandemic. Many have not had any support at all to date, through no fault of their own. We do not have to cast blame but we do need to work together in Parliament, to highlight the gaps and to find ways to fill them. __ __

In the above video, a passionate 31-year-old gentleman, beside an angry 45-year-old gentleman, is telling the 16-year old that ten years from now he will still be protesting over the same issues and that he must _“come up with a better way”_ to address the issues that plague their community. That is an error. It is our job and our duty as the older generation and as a society to show young people the way. _If we do not know the way, how can we expect teenagers to find the way?_ This video and the hundreds of social media posts and articles after George Floyd’s death have made me realize that most of us have no plan because we do not understand the system in which we live and operate.

Never talk about your future kids? Please at least agree on whether or not you will have them. If you never talk about where you want to live, desires for family, or future plans, how do you know whether you will want to live similar lifestyles? You need to get on the same page.

With the debate continuing over personal freedoms and face coverings, Western Mass News spoke with an attorney.
 He said businesses cannot refuse services to people over discriminatory reasons like race or ancestry, but had a different answer for masks.
 “Wearing a mask is not one of those protected classes, and in fact pursuant to Gov. Baker’s executive order, businesses are required to enforce the wearing of masks,” Pacella said.
 For Herrell, she said enforcing these rules and policies has created the biggest challenge in the shop’s 40 years in business.
 “The hardest summer we’ve ever had, and I don’t mean financially,” she said. “Yes, it is the hardest financially, as well, but there are more angry people out there right now who say, ‘It’s my way or the highway.’”
 Although indoor dining is now allowed in Massachusetts, Herrell said she has limited space.
 For that reason and more, she’s taking social distancing a step further and asking all her customers to comply.
 There are only two now allowed to eat inside the store.
 “Max and Maven Bear,” she said.
 Herrell said the reason she is sticking to the rules is that her shop is popular with families and wants to avoid children and parents contracting the virus.

But behind the scenes, it was a much different story - one of significant delays by China and considerable frustration among WHO officials over not getting the information they needed to fight the spread of the deadly virus, The Associated Press has found.

Tamarack Aquatic Wellness Center, known for its warm water therapeutic pool in south Eugene, announced the indefinite closure of the pool, citing a combination of low attendance, the lack of income for the past three months and an increase of COVID-19 cases in Lane County.
   
 The Tamarack Board of Directors made the call effective July 2, after the pool reopened following months of being closed. Reservations were few and the pool received many cancellations, resulting in less than one-sixth of normal attendance.
   
 "We feel like we're doing the responsible thing by taking a break right now and not having an ongoing expense that we can't get out of," said Monica Shovlin, vice president and interim treasurer of the Tamarack board of directors. "We want to look toward the future and try to find that right partnership where we do have a sustainable model."
   
 Shovlin added that before the pandemic, the center had 600 to 700 visits a week, and even so, the cost of maintaining an aging pool made it so the nonprofit organization operated at "break even at best." Unlike some recreation centers, which have other sources of revenue, Tamarack relies entirely on money made from pool visits, specifically swim lessons. COVID- related closures and the slow trickle of returning business made maintaining the location impossible, according to Shovlin.
   
 The pool, at 3575 Donald St., had 21 staff members before the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated closure of public and community pools.
   
 However, some staff and board members are hoping to keep the spirit of the pool, which was built specifically to serve people with special needs, alive in the community until another location can be established.
   
 "I call it a miracle place because it's helped me and a lot of people with disabilities have a place to go," Merton Cameron said.
   
 Cameron has muscular dystrophy and patronized the center since the late '80s. He said the accessible warm water pool was a place he could exercise, but meant something more.
   
 "A lot of disabled people, we don't have a lot of things to go to or all lot of people to see," Cameron said. "So, to go there and see other disabled people, be around other people and have a good time in the pool, it's more than just exercising, it's been a place for us to gather."
   
 Tamarack is the only 92-degree pool in the area. The Eugene Family YMCA keeps its warm pool in the mid-70s and Willamalane keeps its shallow warm pool at 88 degrees.
   
 Another pool patron, Geralyn Donze, had been going to the pool six days a week, prior to the initial COVID-related closure. She's been a loyal client and sometime-volunteer for 10 years. Donze said the pool was essential to her healing after she had a stroke five years ago.
   
 "Tamarack is basically the main reason I have recovered a lot of my abilities," Donze said.
   
 The center is not the only pool facing hard decisions and big changes brought on by the pandemic. Sabrina Hershey Black, the aquatic director at the Eugene Family YMCA, said that center's pools have had to make big adjustments to adapt to social distancing. Many classes have had to be suspended, lap swimming is distanced and guests are limited to 45-minute swims. While the challenges have been plenty, they have brought aquatic communities together, which is a silver lining, she said.
   
 "Tamarack is going to be hard to replace," Hershey Black said. "It's just really heartbreaking that that resource won't be there for (their clients). Hopefully our other aquatic communities can come together and maybe help to figure out how we can offer some of those things but they were definitely special."

I believe that our issues are deeper than just policing. However, for better or for worse, police officers are the first and most accessible government agents that most persons encounter daily. And unfortunately, the most accessible person in government also has a license to use deadly force. Policing concerns are legitimate but at the end of the day, we must also strengthen the economies of all neighborhoods and communities. The economic recommendations will follow the policing recommendations, but they are just as important. If you don’t address the economics, the policing issues will always be there. It is not this or that, it is both.
