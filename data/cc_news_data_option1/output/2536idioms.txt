A music lover all his life, Paducah native Damon Duffy — who goes by the artist name Hoody — is trying to author his own chapter and verse in rap history.
 The 31-year-old currently calls Nashville home, but says he’ll always be a Kentuckian.
 “I’m back and forth a lot and I bring Kentucky with me everywhere I go,” Duffy told The Sun. “Whenever I can I’m going to make sure they know it’s where I’m from.

They were arrested in Marion County, Oregon this week. They are waiting for extradition.According to our news partners at the Decatur Daily, investigator Jordan Byrd filed an affidavit stating an unnamed female who had lived at the “club house” said Legg and Rogers became upset a few hours before the homicides.Frederic "Rick" RogersThe newspaper reports that the two suspects went to athe house to “wipe the slate clean” because several personal firearms were missing and there had been “perceived disobedience” toward a local membership club.Morgan County Sheriff Ron Puckett said the suspects and three of the victims were part of a local club called “Seven Deadly Sins.”The victims were identified as Tammy England Muzzey, 45, of Valhermoso Springs; Emily Brooke Payne, 21, of Valhermoso Springs; Roger Lee Jones Jr., 19, of Decatur; Jeramy Wade Roberts, 31, of Athens; William Zane Hodgin, 18, of Somerville; James Wayne Benford, 22, of Decatur; and a 17-year-old female whose name was not released.A dog was also shot and killed at the home.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

That’s the same tack Hoody has taken with his music, weaving melody’s over trap and Southern rap beats for his first album, 2019’s independently released “By Bread Alone.”
 “I’ve been rapping since I was in high school, but I didn’t start to take it seriously … until around four years ago,” he explained. “I started to put a couple things on iTunes and people were actually checking for them and going to get ‘em so I thought, ‘Man, I could start to take this a little more seriously.’ ”
 Once Duffy recouped his recording costs, he started plotting his next move — recording “Boss Moves,” a single featuring platinum-selling rapper and Houston hip-hop legend Lil’ Flip that the pair recorded and shot a video for in May.
 “I wanted to do a little more in the industry to see how far I could take this push,” Duffy said. “Lil Flip is a platinum rapper, he’s a big artist, you know. Not only did he do the song with me, he came down to Nashville and shot a music video with me. It was really cool working with him.”
 The single dropped Friday and is currently available on all major streaming services — along with Duffy’s other releases as Hoody — with a music video planned to drop this week.
 With the entertainment world largely shut down due to COVID-19, Duffy plans to use the shutdown to reach new audiences via promotion — he works as a content creator for One Hundred Magazine — and to gear up for another release.
 “I plan on pumping out more music and with quarantine going on I’m probably going to spend a lot of time marketing and pushing this new single just to draw attention. I do already have other songs with features in the pipeline and I plan on maybe towards the end of the year maybe dropping an EP with (all of those on it).”
 While the Bluegrass State has never been at the center of hip-hop — with out- of-state success mostly limited to artists like Nappy Roots and, more recently, Louisville’s Bryson Tiller and Jack Harlowe — Duffy is hoping that it’s all just a waiting game now.
 “We don’t have a strong rap background in Kentucky so I think it’s in everybody’s brains that everybody’s just going to be local and nobody’s going to bust through that glass ceiling,” he said. “To me it’s just a matter of time before I’m the same way as (all of them).”

NEW YORK -- Chesapeake Energy Corp filed for Chapter 11 on Sunday, becoming the largest U.S. oil and gas producer to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years as it bowed to heavy debts and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on energy markets.
 The filing marks an end of an era for the Oklahoma City-based shale pioneer, and comes after months of negotiations with creditors. Reuters first reported in March the company had retained debt advisers.
 Chesapeake was co-founded by Aubrey McClendon, an early and high profile advocate of shale drilling who died in 2016 in a fiery one-car crash in Oklahoma while facing a federal probe into bid rigging. Over more than two decades, McClendon built Chesapeake from a small wildcatter to a top U.S. producer of natural gas. It remains the sixth-largest producer by volume.
 Current CEO Doug Lawler, who inherited a company saddled with about $13 billion in debt in 2013, managed to chip at the debt pile with spending cuts and asset sales, but this year's historic oil price rout left Chesapeake without the ability to refinance that debt.
 "Despite having removed over $20 billion of leverage and financial commitments, we believe this restructuring is necessary for the long-term success and value creation of the business," Lawler said in a statement announcing the filing.
 Lawler last year spent $4 billion on an ill-timed push to reduce Chesapeake's reliance on natural gas. The purchase sent its shares lower and this year the value of Chesapeake's oil and gas holdings fell by $700 million this quarter. The company last month warned it may not be able to continue operations.
 Chesapeake plans to eliminate approximately $7 billion of its debt, the statement said. A separate court filing indicated that Chesapeake has more than $10 billion in liabilities and assets, respectively.
 Chesapeake's outlook plunged this year as the coronavirus outbreak and a Saudi-Russia price war sharply cut energy prices and drove its first-quarter losses to more than $8 billion. On Friday, its stock traded at $11.85, down 93% since the start of the year, leaving it with a market value of $116 million.
 The company has entered into a restructuring support agreement, which has the backing of lenders to its main revolving credit facility - some of which are providing $925 million of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to help fund operations during the bankruptcy proceedings.
 The agreement also has backing from portions of other creditors, including those behind 87% of its term loan, and holders of 60% and 27%, respectively, of its senior secured second lien notes due 2025, and senior unsecured notes.
 While the statement does not name Chesapeake's creditors, investment firm Franklin Resources is among the most significant. On June 15, Reuters reported that Chesapeake's impending restructuring would turn over control of the company to creditors including Franklin.
 Chesapeake also has agreed the principal terms for a $2.5 billion exit financing, while some of its lenders and secured note holders have agreed to backstop a $600 million offering of new shares, to take place upon exiting the Chapter 11 process, the statement added.
 Chesapeake's filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas makes it the largest bankruptcy of an U.S. oil and gas producer since at least 2015, when law firm Haynes & Boone began publishing data on restructurings.
 Chesapeake's advisers are investment banks Rothschild & Co and Intrepid Partners, law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP, and turnaround specialists Alvarez & Marsal.
