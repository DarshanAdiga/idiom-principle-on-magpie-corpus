BALTIMORE -- Kelyn Yanez used to clean homes during the day and wait tables at night in the Houston area before the coronavirus. But the mother of three lost both jobs in March because of the pandemic and now is facing eviction.
   
 The Honduran immigrant got help from a local church to pay part of July's rent but was still hundreds of dollars short and is now awaiting a three-day notice to vacate the apartment where she lives with her children. She has no idea how she will meet her August rent.
   
 "Right now, I have nothing," said Yanez, who briefly got her bar job back when the establishment reopened, but lost it again when she and her 4-year-old daughter contracted the virus in June and had to quarantine. The apartment owners "don't care if you're sick, if you're not well. Nobody cares here. They told me that I had to have the money."
   
 Yanez, who lives in the U.S. illegally, is among some 23 million people nationwide at risk of being evicted, according to The Aspen Institute, as moratoriums enacted because of the coronavirus expire and courts reopen. Around 30 state moratoriums have expired since May, according to The Eviction Lab at Princeton University. On top of that, some tenants were already encountering illegal evictions even with the moratoriums.
   
 Now, tenants are crowding courtrooms -- or appearing virtually -- to detail how the pandemic has upended their lives. Some are low-income families who have endured evictions before, but there are also plenty of wealthier families facing homelessness for the first time -- and now being forced to navigate overcrowded and sometimes dangerous shelter systems amid the pandemic.
   
 Experts predict the problem will only get worse in the coming weeks, with 30 million unemployed and uncertainty whether Congress will extend the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits that expired Friday. The federal eviction moratorium that protects more than 12 million renters living in federally subsidized apartments or units with federally backed mortgages expired July 25. If it's not extended, landlords can initiate eviction proceedings in 30 days.
   
 "It's going to be a mess," said Bill Faith, executive director of Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio, referring to the Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, which found last week that more than 23% of Ohioans questioned said they weren't able to make last month's rent or mortgage payment or had little or no confidence they could pay next month's.
   
 Nationally, the figure was 26.5% among adults 18 years or older, with numbers in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Nevada, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, New York, Tennessee and Texas reaching 30% or higher. The margins of error in the survey vary by state.
   
 "I've never seen this many people poised to lose their housing in a such a short period of time," Faith said. "This is a huge disaster that is beginning to unfold."
   
 Housing advocates fear parts of the country could soon look like Milwaukee, which saw a 21% spike in eviction filings in June, to nearly 1,500 after the moratorium was lifted in May. It's more than 24% across the state.
   
 "We are sort of a harbinger of what is to come in other places," said Colleen Foley, the executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee.
   
 "We are getting calls to us from zip codes that we don't typically serve, the part of the community that aren't used to coming to us," she added. "It's a reflection of the massive job loss and a lot of people facing eviction who aren't used to not paying their rent."
   
 In New Orleans, a legal aid organization saw its eviction-related caseload almost triple in the month since Louisiana's moratorium ended in mid-June. Among those seeking help is Natasha Blunt, who could be evicted from her two- bedroom apartment where she lives with her two grandchildren.
   
 Blunt, a 50-year-old African American, owes thousands of dollars in back rent after she lost her banquet porter job. She has yet to receive her stimulus check and has not been approved for unemployment benefits. Her family is getting by with food stamps and the charity of neighbors.
   
 "I can't believe this happened to me because I work hard," said Blunt, whose eviction is at the mercy of the federal moratorium. "I don't have any money coming in. I don't have nothing. I don't know what to do. ... My heart is so heavy."
   
 Along with exacerbating a housing crisis in many cities that have long been plagued by a shortage of affordable options, widespread discrimination and a lack of resources for families in need, the spike in filings is raising concerns that housing courts could spread the coronavirus.
   
 Many cities are still running hearings virtually. But others, like New Orleans, have opened their housing courts. Masks and temperature checks are required, but maintaining social distance has been a challenge.
   
 "The first couple of weeks, we were in at least two courts where we felt really quite unsafe," said Hannah Adams, a staff attorney with Southeast Louisiana Legal Services.
   
 In Columbus, Ohio, Amanda Wood was among some 60 people on the docket Friday for eviction hearings at a convention center converted into a courtroom.
   
 Wood, 23, lost her job at a claims management company in early April. The following day, the mother of a 6-month-old found out she was pregnant again. Now, she is two months behind rent and can't figure out a way to make ends meet.
   
 Wood managed to find a part-time job at FedEx, loading vans at night. But her pregnancy and inability to find stable childcare has left her with inconsistent paychecks.
   
 "The whole process has been really difficult and scary," said Wood, who is hoping to set up a payment scheduled after meeting with a lawyer Friday. "Not knowing if you're going to have somewhere to live, when you're pregnant and have a baby, is hard."
   
 Though the numbers of eviction filings in Ohio and elsewhere are rising and, in some places reaching several hundred a week, they are still below those in past years for July. Higher numbers are expected in August and September.
   
 Experts credit the slower pace to the federal eviction moratorium as well as states and municipalities that used tens of millions of dollars in federal stimulus funding for rental assistance. It also helped that several states, including Massachusetts and Arizona, have extended their eviction moratorium into the fall.
   
 Still, experts argue more needs to be done at the state and federal level for tenants and landlords.
   
 Negotiations between Congress and the White House over further assistance are ongoing. A $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed in May by Democrats in the House would provide about $175 billion to pay rents and mortgages, but the $1 trillion counter from Senate Republicans only has several billion in rental assistance. Advocacy groups are looking for over $100 billion.
   
 "An eviction moratorium without rental assistance is still a recipe for disaster," said Graham Bowman, staff attorney with the Ohio Poverty Law Center. "We need the basic economics of the housing market to continue to work. The way you do that is you need broad-based rental assistance available to families who have lost employment during this crisis."
   
 "The scale of this problem is enormous so it needs a federal response."

In light of these failings, I am disappointed at how Georgetown has billed itself as a school that takes cura personalis seriously. I am aware I am not the only financial aid student who is facing increased hardship because of the pandemic, which has only been exacerbated by Georgetown’s inadequate and untimely guidance. While a 10% tuition reduction looks good on paper, the sinister reality is that many low-income students have been placed in even worse financial situations by Georgetown. In many cases, including my own, Georgetown has accounted for the 10% tuition cut by reducing aid rather than reducing the EFC. While the university has taken steps to correct this disparity by announcing a tuition credit of an additional 10% of tuition to students on financial aid, it had initially only planned to apply the 10% tuition cut to students whose families can afford full tuition. The university’s initial position, before public pressure forced a change, only reaffirms the prioritization of donors and its own image over the needs of low-income students.

But Gov. Doug Ducey has made it clear that school boards will ultimately have to make the decision about whether to offer in-person classes – regardless of the promised state benchmarks.
 The Governor backed away from an earlier order for schools to, on Aug. 17, start offering in-person classes for students who want that and distance learning for those who prefer not to come to campus.
 However, COVID-19 cases soared after he lifted the stay-at-home order on May 15. This prompted a new order, saying school boards can stick to distance learning classes for as long as they want – with one key caveat.
 Even if the district offers only distance learning, schools must still provide a safe space to study, spend the day and access the internet for any student who shows up.
 All over the state, schools are trying to come up with a plan in the face of bewildering uncertainty – and waiting for the Aug. 7 guidelines.
 Surveys in many districts suggest anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of parents would rather continue with distance learning, given the surge in COVID-19 cases statewide.
 So even if schools do reopen for in-person classes sometime after Aug. 17, districts will also have to provide a distance learning option for every student. This could pose huge problems when it comes to staffing both in- person and distance learning versions of every class.
 And if districts opt to offer only distance learning classes, they still have to figure out a way to keep campuses open for any student who shows up for lack of somewhere safe to go and study – a requirement that amounts to academically supervised daycare.
 All of which leaves schools statewide in a furor of uncertainty.
 School districts in Apache and Navajo County may have trouble coming close to meeting the state’s pandemic benchmarks, despite a decline in the rate of new infections in recent weeks. Both counties have high per-capita infection rates and a high percentage of positive tests – both potential benchmarks, based on national studies.
 The federal Centers for Disease Control has released new guidelines strongly favoring the return to in-person classes. Earlier guidelines had stressed the need for limited spread in the surrounding community, the ability to allow social distancing by students even in class and adequate testing capability to detect new infections in the classroom and check to see if the virus had spread among close contacts.
 However, after President Trump criticized the guidelines as too expensive and restrictive, the CDC issued new guidelines.
 Those guidelines note that international studies in countries that opened schools have seen only limited clusters – especially in elementary schools. Children are much less likely to contract the virus and generally have only mild symptoms if they do. This suggests high school students, teachers, staff and family members face a greater risk from a school-based infection than the younger children themselves.
 On the other hand, the suspension of in-person learning nationally and internationally has resulted in an array of problems for children. Many have lost months of learning, according to multiple studies. Those learning gaps are especially pronounced among low-income students. Many schools in Apache and Navajo counties have a high percentage of low-income families.
 Moreover, children gain many social, mental and emotional benefits from attending school. Studies have shown a significant increase in hunger, child abuse, depression and mental health problems linked to the closure of schools last spring, according to the CDC guidelines on reopening schools.
 For now, everything’s up in the air. Arizona still hasn’t released its health criteria, leaving schools in limbo after months of uncertainty and improvisation.
 Nationally, epidemiologists have said a two-week decline in new cases plus a decline in the percentage of positive tests suggests the virus may be decreasing in the community. However, that advice depends on doing enough testing to accurately reflect the trend in new infections. Arizona has one of the lowest test rates in the country and a backlog has delayed results for a week or more – making the trends more uncertain. This could also complicate any reopening plan, since schools may not have access to enough testing to confirm a new case that could start a cluster.
 Both Apache and Navajo counties remain a long way from meeting most potential benchmarks.
 Apache and Navajo counties at one point had among the highest infection rates in the nation, but the pace of the outbreak has slowed in recent weeks.

It should go without saying that I will not be able to attend Georgetown next year if I am expected to pay this much. Beyond the problems I have already illustrated, my new EFC does not account for the fact that I still have to pay for essentials. Just because the fall semester is virtual does not mean I do not have to eat or pay rent. For reference, using data from last year, an average semester with an 18-week meal plan and 200 Flex dollars was $3,007, and a standard double room rate for Harbin Hall was $5,390. Overall, the expenses of room and board were embedded into my EFC last year, yet the university has failed to adjust my EFC accordingly this year by not considering the additional costs of living at home.

The prime minister and presidency said on Tuesday that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years at the port without safety measures.
 "It is negligence," the official source told Reuters, adding that the storage safety issue had been before several committees and judges and "nothing was done" to issue an order to remove or dispose of the highly combustible material.
 The source said a fire had started at warehouse 9 of the port and spread to warehouse 12, where the ammonium nitrate was stored.
 Tuesday's explosion was the most powerful ever suffered by Beirut, a city is still scarred by civil war three decades ago and reeling from a deep financial crisis rooted in decades of corruption and economic mismanagement.
 Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI on Wednesday that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.
 "We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why," Daher said.
 Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned that if it was not moved it would "blow up all of Beirut".
 According to two documents seen by Reuters, Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in 2016 and 2017 to ask the "concerned maritime agency" to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate, removed from the a cargo vessel, Rhosus, and deposited in warehouse 12, to ensure port safety.
 One of the documents cited similar requests in 2014 and 2015.
 "A local and international investigation needs to be conducted into the incident, given the scale and the circumstances under which these goods were brought into the ports," said Ghassan Hasbani, former deputy prime minister and a member of the Lebanese Forces party.
 Shiparrested.com, an industry network dealing with legal cases, had said in a 2015 report that the Rhosus, sailing under a Moldovan flag, docked in Beirut in September 2013 when it had technical problems while sailing from Georgia to Mozambique with 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate.
 It said that, upon inspection, the vessel was forbidden from sailing and shortly afterwards it was abandoned by its owners, leading to various creditors coming forward with legal claims.
 "Owing to the risks associated with retaining the ammonium nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port's warehouses," it added.

SPRINGERVILLE — The Bringham Fire was ignited by lightning on the Apache- Sitgreaves National Forests’ Clifton Ranger District on June 6, 2020.
 Conditions at the time were extremely dry, and the fire, burning in steep rugged terrain, quickly grew beyond the capacity of available firefighting resources. On June 7, the White Mountain Zone Type 3 Incident Management Team, led by Incident Commander Matt Bullmore, assumed command. Driven by strong winds, the Bringham Fire doubled in size on June 11, initiating the action for the Forest to order the Southwest Incident Management Team 4, led by Incident Commander Carl Schwope beginning June 13.
 Throughout the duration of the incident, firefighters worked to keep the fire from spreading west of Highway 191, an identified value at risk. Successful on-the-ground and aerial firefighting efforts decreased the fires complexity, and on June 23, the Type 2 Team transitioned management of the fire back to the White Mountain Zone Type 3 Team. Over the next week, fire activity and growth decreased, and command transitioned from the White Mountain Zone Type 3 Team to a Type 4 Organization, led by Incident Commander Joe Names, on July 2.
 Thanks to successful firefighting efforts, and the tireless contributions made by the many resources that battled the blaze, the Bringham Fire was declared 100% contained on July 29, 2020. The suppression cost to date for the Bringham Fire is $9.4 million.
 Monsoon showers have recently blanketed the Bringham Fire, and the potential for flooding has been analyzed.

In tema di giustizia si sta consumando uno scontro senza precedenti che desta sconcerto ed allarme nei confronti del paese tutto. Numerosi, in questi giorni, sono stati i richiami al “buon senso” istituzionale, pervenuti da più parti, interne ed esterne alla magistratura, rimasti senza esito alcuno. E’ recente la presa di posizione di alcuni Giudici del Tribunale che reputano di “non poter dare applicazione” alle disposizioni emanate dalla dott.ssa Valeria Pierfelici “in quanto gravemente lesive dei principi costituzionali che informano l’attività giurisdizionale”: ciò, senza prendere parte su chi ha ragione o torto, appare un atto esorbitante rispetto alle ordinarie (ma anche rispetto a straordinarie) dinamiche democratiche, che ben dà il peso del livello del conflitto in atto. Non si contano ormai le esternazioni mediatiche delle vicende giudiziarie sammarinesi, su tutti i media nazionali ed esteri, che lasciano incredulo perfino chi è totalmente estraneo al contesto giuridico istituzionale. Non possiamo più permetterci tutto ciò, questo scempio deve cessare perché è facilmente pronosticabile una profonda paralisi dei processi. Non si contano ormai più le volte in cui l’Ordine degli Avvocati ha richiamato all’equilibrio le parti coinvolte nello scontro, senza mai entrare nel merito del contraddittorio politico, e oggi, a distanza di anni, persiste una frattura, non solo politica ma anche interna al tribunale, resa plasticamente per via mediatica, con pubblicazione di atti sui media locali ed italiani, che evidenziano, senza mezzi termini, quanto grave, ed a tratti surreale, sia la crisi interna all’ordinamento giudiziario. Non è più possibile, per gli operatori del diritto, assistere silenti alle “denunce” che la stessa magistratura esprime a viva voce, sintomo di reale disagio, che pongono seriamente in dubbio l’aspettativa del cittadino di trovarsi nel luogo in cui si amministra la giustizia. In questo modo si è giunti ad avvelenare un settore fondamentale della nostra società, vitale anche in campo economico, ed attenzionato da chiunque intenda confrontarsi con il nostro paese. Una lotta politica e non solo, purtroppo degenerata a livelli impensabili, ha provocato lacerazioni che ora DEVONO ESSERE RISANATE, tornando ad un sereno e proficuo confronto istituzionale, pena la totale disfatta. L’OAN crede sia giunto il momento di porre l’accento sugli incommensurabili danni che il perdurare dello scontro sulla giustizia sta causando, passando così da un ruolo istituzionalmente improntato a toni alti e moderati, a un ruolo più attivo verso coloro che stanno sfasciando il tribunale. Verrà presto attivato l’organo assembleare per valutare le forme di sensibilizzazione e di protesta al fine di scongiurare la progressiva delegittimazione della giustizia, che si riverbera sui diritti di tutti i cittadini.
