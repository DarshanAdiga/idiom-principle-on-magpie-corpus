Localhost bound services expect that only trusted, local processes can interact with them, and thus often serve requests without authentication.

The Bank recorded provision for loan losses of $1.75 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. In continued anticipation of a COVID-19 related adverse economic impact, management reserved $1.25 million increasing the allowance for loan losses allocated to COVID-19 to $2.00 million. Various "Stay-at-Home Orders" continued to result in temporary business closures, reduced operating capacity and uncertainty regarding potential future revenue and cash flows for certain businesses, including bank borrowers. Approximately $100 thousand of the provision was related to loan portfolio growth in the quarter. The remaining provision was related to the impact of net loan charge-offs of $212 thousand and necessary increases in specific and unallocated allowance for loan losses. In the first quarter of 2020, approximately $750 thousand of provision for loan losses was due to COVID-19, $600 thousand was due to loan growth with the remaining $650 thousand due to increases in specific and unallocated allowances, and net charge-offs of $485 thousand.

The average earnings forecast was $1.04 by seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Analysts do not include one-time gains and charges in their forecasts.
 On April 24, Old Dominion confirmed that a COVID-19 pandemic-related decline in business led “to a necessary adjustment to our workforce.”
 The company declined to say at that time how many employees were affected by the furloughs, how many days or weeks of furlough were required, or how long the cutbacks was projected to last.
 Adam Satterfield, Old Dominion’s chief financial officer, told analysts in April that “due to the unprecedented decrease in revenue we experienced in April, we implemented the furlough program in attempt to balance the number of employees actively working with current freight trends.”
 On Thursday, the company listed having an average 17,911 employees during the second quarter, down 10% from 19,948 in the first quarter and down 13.6% from 20,735 a year ago. That was the only mention of workforce count in the formal news release.
 As of Dec. 31, Old Dominion had 910 employees at its headquarters in Thomasville and 720 workers at a service center in southwest Greensboro. The company is expanding its Greensboro center and establishing a similar center in the Guilford County side of Kernersville.
 Old Dominion, a bellwether for the U.S. economy as a top-10 trucking company, warned on June 3 it had experienced a sharp shipping and revenue decline for May.
 Revenue for the quarter fell 15.5% year-over-year to $896.2 million.

Dear Editor,
 The recent Youtube video about “Harrison Arkansas, the Most Racist city in America” was a setup. It was incorrect about Harrison being the home of the KKK. We are only the P.O. box of the KKK. It was the worst kind of yellow, new-age “journalism.”
 I am just as disgusted with the BLM, Antifa, DNC, CNN, MSM support of violence as recourse for the sins of a few.
 I just wanted to say this.
 What were those people screaming threats and foul language thinking? If NO ONE is going to take the high ground, then where does that leave our kids? Do we simply give up on the election of 2020 and instead wait for…whatever comes after?
 We are Americans. None of us are from here. Even the “native” or “first people” came here from somewhere else.
 Are we NO BETTER than the thugs these people seemed to be ranting about? Are we not civilized enough to accept a blow and turn the other cheek? For all the hosannas we bleat, do we not remember what they mean?
 We are either God-fearing Christians engaged in making this a better world or we are NOT!
 I pray for us and for our adversaries. We all need to remember why we are here.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina legislative committee has approved a model of a statue honoring the late Rev. Billy Graham to replace one of a former governor and white supremacist who currently represents the state in the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall. The Legislature’s Statuary Hall Selection Committee on Wednesday approved the model of the Southern Baptist minister created by Charlotte-based sculptor Chas Fagan, The Charlotte Observer reported. A congressional committee will hold a final vote on the model. Graham, a Charlotte native who was a counselor to presidents, has been described as the most widely heard Christian evangelist in history. He died in 2018 at the age of 99. Each state is allowed two statues to represent it in the hall, and the statue of Graham would replace that of Charles Aycock, a governor who also led white supremacist campaigns at the turn of the 20th century. Aycock's statue has represented North Carolina in the hall for nearly 90 years. A bill by the Democratic-led House Appropriations Committee announced this month seeks to remove all Confederate busts and statues of “individuals with unambiguous records of racial intolerance” from the Capitol, including Aycock's. The plan to replace his statue with one of Graham has been in the works since 2015, but the bill would speed up the removal process and also affect North Carolina’s other statue, which depicts Zebulon B. Vance, a former governor and Confederate military officer, according to The Charlotte Observer. Former State Rep. Dan Soucek, who proposed the switch, said representatives wanted the statue to be of someone who made an impact in the lives of North Carolinians and those around the world. “When people from all over the country and all over the world walk...

As a result, Cooley and colleagues questioned whether factors other than income and education, known as objective indicators of status, may not buy happiness for white people. Instead, they investigated the role of social comparisons - or the desire to "keep up with the Joneses."

What would Ben Franklin think?
 The Founding Father who launched one of America’s first street-sweeping programs in Philadelphia in the late 1750s would see and smell piles of fly- infested, rotting household waste, bottles and cans as the city that he called home struggles to overcome a surge in garbage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “It’s just the smell of rot,” said James Gitto, president of the West Passyunk neighborhood association in South Philadelphia. Gitto said the situation devolved through July into “a total mess” and he hired a private recycling company to haul away his bottles and cans.
 For the City of Brotherly Love, another unfortunate nickname has been “ Filthadelphia.” Poverty and litter often go hand in hand, and in the nation’s poorest big city, the sanitation department has been short-handed and overworked. The city's 311 complaint line received more than 9,700 calls about trash and recycling in July, compared with 1,873 in February.
 Faced with social distancing restrictions, residents are staying home and generating more trash than ever before — about a 30% increase in residential trash collections, said Streets Commissioner Carlton Williams.
 “I’ve never seen the amount of tonnage,” Williams said.
 Baltimore and Memphis are among some of the cities facing similar problems. In Boston, some residents have reported rats the size of cats.
 People are cleaning out garages and attics, Williams said. That’s in addition to household trash that has increased as more people cook at home or bring home takeout from restaurants that have not yet fully opened. His department also has had to clean up after protests over racial injustice.
