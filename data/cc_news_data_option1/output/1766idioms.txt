Both rates have been introduced for when the lockdown lifts and those planning travel in the future. __


  In a drastic and welcomed move, the hotel chain have also transferred all its existing Non-Flex and Semi-Flex bookings to Advance and new Semi-Flex respectively, at no extra cost.


  The move, believed to be the first of its type among major hotel companies, ensures all Premier Inn guests can take advantage of the extra flexibility now being offered.


  With advance rates starting at just £35 and for those that book a little closer to their stay dates being able to book Semi-Flex, the rate shifts will be a hit for those wanting a swift getaway as soon as the goverment guidelines change.


  Premier Inn Managing Director Simon Ewins said: “We fully appreciate these are uncertain times for everyone and are pleased to launch our new Advance and Semi-Flex rate products. In the first instance, it was really important to us that all our existing booked guests were able to take advantage - so we’ve automatically transferred every booking to the new products. In particular, this is great news for people who were booked on Non-Flex rates and were previously unable to cancel or change their booking and can now do so within the new rate rules. Other than those supporting key workers, our hotels are of course currently closed, but we hope the new rate products will bring a new world of flexibility to all our customers and help them book with confidence”.


  In light of the lockdown, the hotel company has been working to support key workers throughout the crisis, including by offering free meals at selected hotels in partnership with Deliveroo and by negotiating discounted taxi services with third-party providers.


  Book direct for bookings from the end of May on the Premier Inn website here.

  U.S. states including Texas and South Carolina have allowed restaurants and some other businesses to reopen. California might allow some retailers to resume serving customers this week.


  Still, the deputy chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Richard Clarida, said Tuesday the economy needs more support from the central bank and possibly additional government spending before it can recover.


  Expectations for stronger demand for oil as more businesses get the green light to open helped drive oil prices higher.


  The S&P 500 gained to 2,868.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% to 23,883.09. The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% to 8,809.12.

  Disney fell 3% after the company reported a steep drop in quarterly profit as many segments of its media and entertainment offerings ground to a standstill during the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, the company said costs related to COVID-19 cut Disney’s pretax profit by $1.4 billion.


  Hopes that economic revival will boost energy demand helped to lift oil prices that had plunged to record-setting lows.


  In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude fell back, giving up 16 cents to $24.40 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract jumped 20.5% on Tuesday to settle at $24.56.

BETTY ZANE (GALLAGHER) WOODS, 93, passed away on Saturday, May 2, 2020, at the Liberty Village in Peoria, Ill. Born April 28, 1927, in LaGrange, Ga., she was the daughter of the late Karl and Zada (Benfield) Gallagher. During World War II she served as a singer with the USO. It was there that she met her husband, Joseph, who was a sergeant stationed near the USO station in Wilmington. She graduated from Greensboro High School in North Carolina in 1946, and immediately left for Indiana to meet Joseph's family. Betty married Joseph on Aug. 26, 1946, in Huntington, Ind., at SS Peter and Paul Church. They lived their entire married lives in Fort Wayne where they raised eight children. In addition to raising the children, Betty was very involved in the parishes of Precious Blood and St. Vincent's and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. She was a member of the choir, directed by her husband, as well as a member of the Rosary Society, PTA, and other parish organizations. Her singing career continued with the Fort Wayne Summer Symphony as she was called upon a few times as a guest soprano soloist. Her beautiful voice can be enjoyed on recordings of the St. Vincent de Paul parish choir, as well as on a few family recordings. In 1972, she accompanied her husband with the Central Catholic High School Band to the Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. A few years later, after her youngest child started school, Betty started a new career as a seamstress at JCPenney. Her specialty was making and altering wedding dresses. She worked for Penney's for over 30 years. Always challenging herself to grow, Betty wrote a book about her life entitled, "I Honestly Tried". Sadly, it was left unfinished and unpublished, but what she did write told the tale of a woman who had led an extraordinary life. Another book of memories by her children was compiled by her daughter, Anne. It told many stories of her children's beloved memories of Betty. After retiring, Betty cared for her beloved Joe until he passed on in 2012. After living alone for six years, Betty set out on a new adventure at the age of 91, moving to Peoria, Ill., to be closer to her youngest daughter, Anne. There she lived the final 17 months of her earthly life, enjoying visits from her children and grandchildren. She was quite popular at Liberty Village. The staff there loved her sense of humor and her kindness. Several were moved to tears the day she passed on. Betty's children have many loving memories of her. She loved to laugh and dance. She was a very resourceful person. She was a wonderful cook and baker. She was willing to help her children when they were in a jam. She could fix a soiled wedding dress in the nick of time. She taught them to paint by numbers. For some, that was just the beginning. She taught them how to do little jobs around the house, which would become big jobs as they grew up. Her green thumb was the envy of the neighborhood, and she was known for having an amazing vegetable garden. One thing about Betty that became increasingly apparent over the years was the sheer strength, courage, and resilience with which she lived her life. From her grandchildren's perspective, Grandma was an amazing encouragement and inspiration through the years. She taught her grandchildren how to be tough but not lose their smile. She encouraged them to travel the world and expand their horizons. They followed her advice and have had the most amazing journeys as a result. They will forever be grateful. Grandma was always very attentive and genuinely interested to hear what they were doing. She unfailingly supported them and said often how proud she was of them. Betty would spend endless late hours rocking and singing children and grandchildren to sleep. "Now we all can sing her to sleep. Sleep well, Betty. May God bless you forever." She is survived by her children, Milton (Audrey) Woods, Michael (Julie) Woods, Jeanne (Larry) Clark, Timothy (Jennifer) Woods, Mary Woods, Karla (Jim) Lamley, and Anne (Tim) Kennedy. She has 11 nieces and nephews, 23 grandchildren and four great- grandchildren. Betty was preceded in death by her husband, Joseph M. Woods, in 2012; and son, Stephen Woods. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a private service will be held. Burial will be in Catholic Cemetery, Fort Wayne. Memorial contributions may be made to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.

When Thai internet users created images critical of them, the little pinks often found it difficult to come up with a complete argument, or to rationally explain their own opinions. They were helpless to refute their claims. In the end, all they could do was “trash-talk the country.” Trash-talking the other country itself, on the one hand, is an attempt to cover up their own lack of knowledge, critical thinking, and reason. It also demonstrates their unwillingness to accept the opinions of others, or to accept the things that others point out as wrong. “Trash-talking the country” became their last resort. It also acted as a blindfold to shield them from their shame. I just never would have thought, in the end, that Thai internet users would not only get the better of them, but also, would come up with the expression “NMSL” trending on Twitter yesterday and a whole series of other derivative expressions: NMSLese, NMSLand, NMSLism, etc.

Now, that company has asked for $60 billion in government support.

According to the _Washington Post_ , $17 billion was carved out in that deal for companies “critical to maintaining national security” (with Boeing in particular in mind). When, however, it became clear that those funds wouldn’t arrive as a complete blank check, the company started to have second thoughts.

Bright's complaint comes as the Trump administration faces criticism over its response to the pandemic, including testing and supplies of ventilators, masks and other equipment to try to stem the spread. To date, there have been nearly 1.2 million confirmed cases in the United States and more than 70,000 deaths.
 Bright also said the Trump administration rejected his warnings on COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. He said he "acted with urgency" to address the growing spread of COVID-19 after the World Health Organization issued a warning in January.
 But he said he "encountered resistance from HHS leadership, including Health and Human Services Secretary (Alex) Azar, who appeared intent on downplaying this catastrophic event."
 Bright alleges in the complaint that political appointees at the Department of Health and Human Services tried to promote hydroxychloroquine "as a panacea." The officials also "demanded that New York and New Jersey be 'flooded' with these drugs, which were imported from factories in Pakistan and India that had not been inspected by the FDA," the complaint says.
 But Bright opposed broad use of the drug, arguing the scientific evidence wasn't there to back up its use in coronavirus patients. He felt an urgent need to tell the public there wasn't enough scientific evidence to support using the drugs for COVID-19 patients, the complaint states.
 Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned doctors against prescribing the drug except in hospitals and research studies. In an alert, regulators flagged reports of sometimes fatal heart side effects among coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine or the related drug chloroquine.
 The decades-old drugs, also prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause a number of side effects, including heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.
 In late January, Bright said he made an effort to ramp up federal procurement of N95 respirator masks, after having heard warnings that a global shortage could imperil first-responders.
 But he said his boss, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Preparedness Robert Kadlec, gave short shrift to the warnings during a meeting Jan. 23.
 At another meeting that day, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Kadlec "responded with surprise at (Bright's) dire predictions and urgency, and asserted that the United States would be able to contain the virus and keep it out," the whistleblower complaint said.
 Publicly, HHS was saying it had all the masks that would be needed.

It was there that she met her husband, Joseph, who was a sergeant stationed near the USO station in Wilmington. She graduated from Greensboro High School in North Carolina in 1946, and immediately left for Indiana to meet Joseph's family. Betty married Joseph on Aug. 26, 1946, in Huntington, Ind., at SS Peter and Paul Church. They lived their entire married lives in Fort Wayne where they raised eight children. In addition to raising the children, Betty was very involved in the parishes of Precious Blood and St. Vincent's and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. She was a member of the choir, directed by her husband, as well as a member of the Rosary Society, PTA, and other parish organizations. Her singing career continued with the Fort Wayne Summer Symphony as she was called upon a few times as a guest soprano soloist. Her beautiful voice can be enjoyed on recordings of the St. Vincent de Paul parish choir, as well as on a few family recordings. In 1972, she accompanied her husband with the Central Catholic High School Band to the Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. A few years later, after her youngest child started school, Betty started a new career as a seamstress at JCPenney. Her specialty was making and altering wedding dresses. She worked for Penney's for over 30 years. Always challenging herself to grow, Betty wrote a book about her life entitled, "I Honestly Tried". Sadly, it was left unfinished and unpublished, but what she did write told the tale of a woman who had led an extraordinary life. Another book of memories by her children was compiled by her daughter, Anne. It told many stories of her children's beloved memories of Betty. After retiring, Betty cared for her beloved Joe until he passed on in 2012. After living alone for six years, Betty set out on a new adventure at the age of 91, moving to Peoria, Ill., to be closer to her youngest daughter, Anne. There she lived the final 17 months of her earthly life, enjoying visits from her children and grandchildren. She was quite popular at Liberty Village. The staff there loved her sense of humor and her kindness. Several were moved to tears the day she passed on. Betty's children have many loving memories of her. She loved to laugh and dance. She was a very resourceful person. She was a wonderful cook and baker. She was willing to help her children when they were in a jam. She could fix a soiled wedding dress in the nick of time. She taught them to paint by numbers. For some, that was just the beginning. She taught them how to do little jobs around the house, which would become big jobs as they grew up. Her green thumb was the envy of the neighborhood, and she was known for having an amazing vegetable garden. One thing about Betty that became increasingly apparent over the years was the sheer strength, courage, and resilience with which she lived her life. From her grandchildren's perspective, Grandma was an amazing encouragement and inspiration through the years. She taught her grandchildren how to be tough but not lose their smile. She encouraged them to travel the world and expand their horizons. They followed her advice and have had the most amazing journeys as a result. They will forever be grateful. Grandma was always very attentive and genuinely interested to hear what they were doing. She unfailingly supported them and said often how proud she was of them. Betty would spend endless late hours rocking and singing children and grandchildren to sleep. "Now we all can sing her to sleep. Sleep well, Betty. May God bless you forever." She is survived by her children, Milton (Audrey) Woods, Michael (Julie) Woods, Jeanne (Larry) Clark, Timothy (Jennifer) Woods, Mary Woods, Karla (Jim) Lamley, and Anne (Tim) Kennedy. She has 11 nieces and nephews, 23 grandchildren and four great- grandchildren. Betty was preceded in death by her husband, Joseph M. Woods, in 2012; and son, Stephen Woods. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a private service will be held. Burial will be in Catholic Cemetery, Fort Wayne. Memorial contributions may be made to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.

Balochistan and erstwhile FATA were the epicenter of terrorism and military operations that disrupted the socio-economic fabric of these underdeveloped areas. After being on the receiving end of terrorist violence for well over a decade, these areas are plagued with illiteracy, unemployment and deplorable health facilities which speak volumes about state criminal neglect and its failure to bring normalcy to these areas. Students belonging to these areas were enrolled in different universities of Punjab to pursue their higher education. They were forced to vacate their hostels and were advised to go back to their hometowns in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. This non-provision of internet facility is sowing the seeds of discontent and students have started questioning the inequitable state structure which has resulted in persecution of people belonging to these areas.

“I needed food when there wasn’t no pandemic,” Carter, who played 15 seasons in the NFL with the Philadelphia Eagles, Minnesota Vikings and Miami Dolphins, told the Hall of Fame. "This would have destroyed my family.”
 Carter recognized that having the hall's living members — "Gold Jackets" — help the airline catering company Gate Gourmet on the food relief program was a natural.
 “We’re going to try to raise some resources for these people and to raise some awareness,” said Carter, who asked other Gold Jackets to donate at least $100 to the cause.
 “Being a Hall of Famer, it’s about being a leader on and off the field," he said. "Our commitment, our values, our integrity, the courage we had to play at the highest level — we’re just trying to show that to people right now who just need people to believe in them.
 "We’re just Gold Jackets trying to do good stuff.”

So here we are, in week whatever it is of lockdown, and our true colours are starting to show - not just the grey roots. Those of us who could be described as inclined to the slob side in normal, BC (before corona) life started out with good intentions. How we cleaned that first Saturday, even inside the fridge!But it's not been easy to maintain those standards.Last Saturday, for example - in a move that will have been mirrored by Corona Slobs all over the country - we stopped after a two-rooms-only vacuum. And the weights we ordered are still in their packaging. Meanwhile, those who are naturally self-disciplined, industrious and clean presumably kicked off the lockdown with a spring in their step, recognising it as one heck of an opportunity to create a &quot;bulbs and fuses&quot; drawer, and they've gone from strength to strength, as their social media feeds testify. If you are still not sure which camp you are in, here are some of the signs. 1) You only dress from the top up, and then only when you have a Zoom work meeting.The rest of the time, you wear TV-watching or exercise kit (leggings and a T-shirt), in the hope it will force you to get out there and exercise.2) You have been known to not wash your hair for a week, and mostly put it up in an elastic band, which is deeply unflattering, but what do you care? 3) You are enjoying carbs again, including Mr Kipling cakes from the corner shop, and are resigned to putting on half a stone. You've already put on half a stone, mind you, so maybe we are talking the full 'Covid 14'.Your attitude is, haven't we got enough to worry about without watching our consumption of crisps and alcohol? 4) You tried an online exercise class, but took against it thanks to Adriene, the American 'international yoga teacher and entrepreneur'.Now you jog on the spot when you're making your third cappuccino of the day.5) You imagined you were going to get into cooking, and got out the Magimix for the fourth time since you bought it. At the very least, I'll make hummus, you thought. You haven't.6) You were hell-bent on getting the garden sorted, because you're out there more than ever, and because the neighbours are constantly titivating theirs.Raking up the blossom is as far as you've got, mainly because it feels like you need some new earth to refresh the whole garden situation. Please tell us you can't buy earth on sale in Lidl or Aldi?7) You have read precisely 20 pages of The Mirror And The Light since the start of corona, partly because you are busy watching (which happened entirely by accident) back-to-back episodes of Britannia and Bewitched. 1) You always freshen up in the evening, put on a bit of make-up and a nice top. You've also ordered online some magic hair products, essential vitamins, a home wax kit, toe separators and some summer cashmere in uplifting sorbet colours.2) You are having colourist video consultations and you have a maintenance plan in place. 3) You are making sourdough and focaccia, and then freezing it, because now is no time to be getting back into carbs. 4) You are determined to lose half a stone in lockdown (maybe more), and get Davina arms, if not abs.To that end, you have three online classes a week (mainly pilates and yoga) and a private Zoom tutor (weights). You don't drink during the week and you don't eat before noon.5) You're taking this opportunity to learn to cook new recipes, which must be nutritious, low-carb/fat, not for the novice cook and look good on Instagram. You've been having themed Saturday nights (the latest was Japanese, and took two hours' prep).6) You've spring cleaned your garden, ordered seeds, got a man-in-a-van to drop off some turf and laid a new lawn and ordered some garden furniture. You may have drawn up a plan on paper for how the whole area will look once everything is in place. 7) You're working through the books you want to be able to talk to your girlfriends about, starting with the new Anne Tyler, Girl, Woman, Other and Normal People. As for TV, honestly, you're finding less and less time for that during the lockdown. There is just so much to do...

_I 'm Rick Bright, Dr. Rick Bright, and I want to thank all of the heroes across America who are putting their lives at risk today while working on the front lines to treat people who are suffering during this pandemic._ _I also want to thank all the scientists working long hours behind the scenes to find a cure and a vaccine to halt the spread of this virus as quickly as possible. I am one of those scientists, a scientist who became the director of BARDA in 2016, and it has been a true honor to lead one of the most dedicated teams of scientists at BARDA who are hyper-focused on a single mission to save lives by protecting both our national security and the health and safety of people around the world._ _I 've spent my entire career studying, preparing for, and leading pandemic preparedness response. I've learned, and I've served in various roles in government in industry and global organization before joining BARDA in 2010, to lead our nation's efforts to develop tools to respond to a pandemic._ _It was my job to ensure that our country had life-saving tools to be as prepared as possible for a pandemic like COVID 19 and to date, my team at BARDA has formed over 40 industry partnerships to accelerate the availability of tests and treatments and vaccines to address this pandemic._ _The past few years, however, have been beyond challenging. Time after time, I was pressured to ignore or dismiss expert and scientific recommendations, and instead to award lucrative contracts based on political connections. In other words, I was pressured to let politics and cronyism drive decisions over the opinions of the best scientists we have in government. And ultimately, I was removed from my position because of my continued insistence that the government invest funds allocated by Congress, hard earned tax payer dollars, to address the COVID 19, and invest them into safe and scientifically vetted solutions instead of funding projects that were promoted by cronies, or politically connected companies._ _Most recently, I witnessed government leadership rushing blindly into a potentially dangerous situation by bringing in a non-FDA approved chloroquine from Pakistan and India, from facilities that had never been approved by the FDA. Their eagerness to push blindly forward without sufficient data to put this drug into the hands of Americans, was alarming to me and my fellow scientists. I could not, in good conscience, ignore the scientific recommendations to limit access to those drugs under the direct care of a doctor and instead allow political ambition and timelines to override scientific judgment. And that was just one of the many improper things that I pushed back on with senior leadership within HHS._ _We are in an extraordinarily difficult global crisis and the worst might still be ahead of us. There are many scientific questions yet to be answered. We need strong leadership. Americans need to have all the facts. They need to know the truth about this pandemic. They need to be able to trust that their government and the information that they hear from politicians is based on scientific merit._ _The American people are strong and resilient. We can handle the truth. With accurate and consistent information, Americans can be empowered to help find solutions. We need to reestablish trust in our government and in each other._

Another interesting study of Alexander’s is a coyote word cloud — she asked many people what the first two or three words came to mind when hearing the word coyote. Most often, words like dog, wild and beautiful come to mind, but also many contradictions. Alexander split her language research between agricultural and urban people to see differences. She stated that the agrarian people described behaviour and quality of the animal: “is it healthy?” Compared to urbanites tending to focus on the idea of where it belongs, as in “It’s coming into my space; it should stay out there.”

Whatley’s bill was filed Monday and sent to the Senate Committee on Government Affairs. As of early Tuesday, that committee had no meetings scheduled.
 If the bill gets through the Legislature in its current shortened session, it would need Ivey’s signature.
 “Dr. Harris serves the state with integrity and provides the governor with the best information possible so that she can can make the decisions on behalf of the people of Alabama,” Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said. “With any legislation, we will watch the process play out, and if needed, the governor will offer her input before a bill reaches her desk.
 “However, when legislative leadership informed the governor that they were resuming session amidst a health crisis, they assured her that they would only be addressing budgets and local bills, and that is what Gov. Ivey looks forward to reviewing.”
 Whatley said if the bill doesn’t pass this session, it will likely be refiled in the next regular session.
 Other co-sponsors are Sens. Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, Greg Albritton, R-Range, Jack Williams, R-Mobile, and Chris Elliott, R-Fairhope.
 Elliott has been an advocate for reopening Alabama businesses, particularly small business, shuttered by public health orders.
 “There have clearly been some instances where there have been some overreach here,” Elliott said. “We have some constituents who think we need to look at the broad powers of governor and state health officer.”
 A mid-March health order closed public and private beaches in Elliott’s district.
 “Nowhere else in the state did we close property to the person who owns it,” he said.
 Elliott said SB334 is about checks and balances.
 "These laws have been around a long time and periodically need review,” he said.
 Though he’s not a co-sponsor, Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, is a proponent of the bill.
 “I think (Harris is) doing the job that the law mandates he does, but that’s looking through it as a health care professional, and from that standpoint, I think he’s done an adequate job for what he’s been tasked to do. But there’s another element here and that’s the economy of the state and how it affects our citizens,” Barfoot said. “This would simply allow the Legislature to have a process to have a say so in any of those orders that affect the daily lives of the citizens of Alabama.”

You can tell why the writer strikes a chord with her audience-- she makes her vital but complex subject approachable, always keeping the reader's benefit in mind. For example, you find, in the chapters on insurance and mutual funds, the basics of evaluating and choosing from these financial products, which will serve you well when you face their seller. You find tips for identifying good financial products. Here the writer's emphasis is on adequacy of information. She knows how much you need to know in order to gain what is called operacy-- the skill of getting things done, which in this case means making initial investment decisions and effectively engaging with personal finance professionals. To be absolutely clear, 'Let's Talk Money' will provide a blueprint that you can fill in with some professional help. The book will also help you smell and steer clear of dud investments-- particularly in insurance. For instance, Halan exposes the tempting jargon used to sell you insurance plans that ultimately yield less than fixed deposits. Halan also questions conventional knowledge about gold and real estate as investments in today's India, and compares their returns with those from the stock market. She also points out the various offerings in the mutual fund market. She even delves into the hidden costs of various investments.

NEW DELHI - England all-rounder Ben Stokes says playing in closed stadiums would not dampen the competitive side of matches and that players “would do anything” to get cricket back on television screens for fans to watch during the COVID-19 crisis.


  The spread of the novel coronavirus has brought sport to a standstill. Staging games without spectators has been suggested as one way to resume professional cricket.


  England’s home series against West Indies scheduled for June has been postponed, with the likelihood of those three tests being played later in the summer without fans.


  When asked if cricket might lose its competitive edge in such an atmosphere Stokes, 28, said that even without fans the players would still be going out to win.


  “Think about it, we are walking out to represent our country, we got three lions on our chest and there is a game that we are supposed to win,” Stokes told BBC Radio 5 Live.


  “So whether it’s in front of nobody or, like we are used to, in front of full crowd, I don’t think it’s going to take that competitive side away.


  “It’s a completely different scenario to get our heads around, that there isn’t going to be the atmosphere or cheering that we’re used to when we play international game.


  “We would do anything to get cricket back on the TVs and for people to follow and watch. If that means you have to play in front of nobody then so be it,” he added.


  Stokes, a key part of England’s 2019 World Cup triumph, was not sure when cricket would resume but felt bigger issues were at stake.


  “We are still not 100% sure when that’s going to happen,” he said.


  “... at the end of the day, cricket is just a sport and the safety, health and wellbeing of everybody involved, not just in the team but around cricket community, is important right now.”

Unfortunately, as Covid-19 spread on the aircraft carrier the USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ , that ship became emblematic of how ill-prepared the current Pentagon leadership proved to be in combatting the virus. Despite at least 100 cases being reported on board -- 955 crewmembers would, in the end, test positive for the disease and Chief Petty Officer Charles Robert Thacker Jr. would die of it -- senior Navy leaders were slow to respond. Instead, they kept those sailors at close quarters and in an untenable situation of increasing risk. When an emailed letter expressing the concerns of the ship’s commander, Captain Brett Crozier, was leaked to the press he was quickly removed from command. But while his bosses may not have appreciated his efforts for his crew, his sailors did. He left the ship to a hero’s farewell.

Manuel Ramírez, director general de J. García López, explica que sus salas de velación cuentan con WiFi gratuito para que los deudos presentes compartan el momento a través de videollamadas.
 El directivo de la funeraria mexicana con 40 años en el mercado describe que la soledad en la que están los cuerpos es algo que no había visto. Las familias no pueden despedirse y eso tiene un fuerte impacto en los familiares.
 “Hay que entender la complejidad del momento. Si una persona falleció en aislamiento y soledad en el hospital, vale la pena ofrecer a las familias la oportunidad de despedirse y evitar ese impacto psicológico tan grave que es no poderse despedir de un ser querido".
 Ramírez comentó que en la Fase 2, en la funerarias de la empresa había velaciones por Covid-19 con un máximo de 20 personas en la sala de velación y con tres horas para que la familia hiciera su ritual de despedida.
 Ahora con la Fase 3, los cuerpos están ingresando directamente a los crematorios y si la familia lo requiere se ponen las cenizas en una urna y se aplica el proceso sanitario para despedirse.
 El 24 de marzo Funerarias J. García López atendió su primer servicio de Covid-19 y al 4 de mayo ya reporta 234. “Ayer amanecí con 47 servicios”, dice Manuel Ramírez.
