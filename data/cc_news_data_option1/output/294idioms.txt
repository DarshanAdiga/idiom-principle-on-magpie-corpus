Now, our Charlotte County commissioners do want to help address our water quality challenges. They have come a long way towards understanding many of our problems. But they have limited time to educate themselves and deal with our challenges. Their commission jobs are part time! They have other demands for their time. They have staff, but the staff has plenty of other things to deal with. We are a heavily populated and growing country!
 I’m crystal clear that everyone has our water quality and growth challenges on their radar. I just need to point out these problems are much large than most realize. We have contributed to many of our problems for decades, and they have grown with our population and developments. The costs to address our problems are beyond what local taxpayers can cover. We are talking billions of dollars, and this is not going to just go away or fix itself.
 Look at what other areas have done. I watch programs on our county station about water quality and drinking water problems that Las Vegas, New York, and Chesapeake Bay watersheds have all been forced to deal with. Our issues aren’t unique, and we have many proven solutions to consider. Stop trying to figure it all out again — study the fixes that have succeeded elsewhere.
 One of our major problems with local seagrass is simple to figure out. Boats, especially larger ones, create wakes. This wave actions interacts with the silty bottom and milks up our shallow flats. Turbidity cuts off sunlight, which is crucial for grasses to grow. We have algae, not grass. Algae thrives on the abundant nutrients and covers any grasses remaining.
 Remember that sea grasses contribute oxygen if they can photosynthesize, but this requires sunlight. No one wants to slow down, but we all need seagrasses. What is your answer? Do our manatees have enough seagrasses to maintain current populations? Remember that carrying capacity thing I talked about last week.

That means that in winter, the best fishing spots are usually in the upper Harbor. Owners of canalfront property are often delighted by sheepshead, mangrove snapper and black drum they can catch off their own docks and seawalls. Underwater fish lights are often crowded by dozens of snook and small tarpon all night long.
 But since the weather has been warm, the fish have been in some very weird places. For example, we’ve been getting reports of snook not just on the flats but out on the beaches. Sheepshead have been very much hit or miss in a lot of the areas that are normally dead-on reliable. And whitebait, which should be in the Ten Thousand Islands right now, have been schooling in the Gulf and even the Harbor.
 This all happens because fish don’t use a calendar to tell what time of year it is. They go by water temperature and photoperiod (day length). Obviously, our warm spell hasn’t changed the length of the days, but that just leads to more confusion for the fish. Imagine if you look over at your clock and it says 11 a.m. — but then you look out your window and you see stars in the sky. Is it night or day? Conflicting inputs are very befuddling.
 What we need is some seasonal weather, and looking at the 10-day forecast, it seems like we may be getting exactly that. Hopefully, this recent cold front, followed by a week or so of nights in the low 50s and days in the mid 70s, will bring more fish to the upper Harbor and get them acting right again.
 Aside from that, what should our winter fishing look like? Well, for one thing, shrimpy. As I mentioned, the whitebait is supposed to south of us right now. That means fish are eating other things. Pinfish and other small fish fill some of that need, but a lot of fishy bellies get filled with shrimp in winter. Using them for bait when the fish are already more focused on eating them just makes sense.

John Millman is prepared to do anything to get an edge over Roger Federer, and that includes cheekily requesting their crunch Australian Open third round match is played on a court other than Rod Laver Arena.
 Befitting his status, the Swiss master, making a 21st appearance at Melbourne Park, almost always plays on the centre court where he has won six titles, and Millman is keen to disrupt his momentum.
 “More so just to throw a spanner in the works for Roger,” said the Australian, who memorably beat Federer over four gruelling sets at the US Open in 2018. “I don’t know if he knows the other courts. He hits on the outside ones, but he hasn’t played too many. I don’t know if he would have played too many matches on the outside ones.”
 Federer insisted he’ll play the third-round match wherever he’s told to. “Look, I don’t choose which court I play on,” said the 38-year-old. “You would think a match like this should be played at Rod Laver Arena maybe. He knows Margaret Court Arena better, Melbourne Arena. But I haven’t thought of it. I figure this was always going to be on Rod Laver Arena. I’m ready to go anywhere, whatever it takes.”
 Millman, who admitted organisers would almost certainly not take his request seriously, said he felt courts other than Rod Laver had better crowd support for him.
 “Obviously the matches I played (so far), probably two really special courts, Show Court 3 and Melbourne Arena, are notorious for the crowd support you get there, the vocal Aussies,” he said.
 “I very much consider myself, and I think the people who know me, know that I’m just your typical Aussie bloke. So I’m one of the people. The people get the ground passes and the people go to those courts.”
 Millman, whose defeat of Federer at Flushing Meadow was the biggest of his career, has never gone beyond the Australian Open third round.
 In contrast, Federer has made the semi-finals or better 14 times. But he remains wary of the Australian after his US Open upset, where he struggled in the hot conditions.
 “I think it was a combination of many things that went wrong for me on that day, plus the opponent was ready and tough as nails,” he said of Millman. “I tried everything in the match itself. It was just not meant to be that day. I hit the wall.”

CANTON — A Massena man was sentenced to five years of probation in St. Lawrence County Court for a March driving while intoxicated charge.
 Jordan J. Page, 26, of 146 Center St., was originally charged with felony aggravated driving while intoxicated under Leandra’s Law and driving while ability impaired by drugs and was sentenced for the aggravated DWI.
 New York State Leandra’s Law designates an automatic felony on the first offense of driving drunk with a minor, 15 or younger, inside the vehicle. Mr. Page was reportedly driving with a passenger younger than 4 years old in the back seat.
 On March 2, St. Lawrence County sheriff’s deputies responded to Mr. Page’s vehicle, which had been involved in a car crash in Potsdam while the child in the back seat was not properly restrained. At the scene, deputies determined Mr. Page to be impaired by drugs and alcohol.
 Damages to the vehicle, which was an Enterprise Rent-A-Car rental, were covered by insurance, so Mr. Page’s attorney, Jacob M. Painter told the court Mr. Page should not owe any restitution for the vehicle damages. County Court Judge John F. Richey did not impose any restitution, but he did order Mr. Page to pay a total of $1,570 in mandatory fines, fees and surcharges.
 Judge Richey reminded Mr. Page he could face incarceration in state prison if he violates the terms and conditions of his probation.
 “I don’t want you to ever forget that is hanging over your head,” Judge Richey said.
 Mr. Page’s driver’s license was surrendered at the time of his arraignment, and Judge Richey revoked Mr. Page’s driving privileges for six months.
 Once Mr. Page is eligible to be re-licensed, he’ll receive a mandatory ignition interlock order for 12 months. An ignition interlock requires a driver to blow into a car breathalyzer device before starting a vehicle. Mr. Page was also ordered to pay 25 percent of the cost of the device’s installation and any subsequent or monthly fees associated with it.
 The following people also appeared in St. Lawrence County Court on Tuesday: Devon George, 18, London, Ontario, pleaded guilty to attempted third-degree burglary, reduced from the initial charges of third-degree burglary and third- degree possession of stolen property, in a plea deal with the district attorney’s office.
 As part of the plea deal, Mr. George is expected to be sentenced to six months in St. Lawrence County jail and be considered for youthful offender status. Judge Richey told Mr. George he must follow all jail rules until his March 9 sentencing for the court to uphold its six-month jail sentence commitment and consider granting him youthful offender status.
 Mr. George was charged in August with attempting to enter the St. Lawrence Centre shopping mall in Massena with Joseph George, 18, and Tehahkerato Shenandoah, 19, both of Hogansburg. The trio had allegedly entered the mall on Aug. 11 and stole goods from Progressive Imports by prying the store’s gate open. They then entered the mall again early the next morning on Aug. 12, but were apprehended by police.
 Mr. George was taken to St. Lawrence County jail, where he is being held without bail until his sentencing. Judge Richey said Mr. George’s time in jail would be credited toward the expected six-month sentence, and a $750 bail posted following Mr. George’s arrest was exonerated.
 Jaret L. Langstaff, 42, last known address of 605 Montgomery St., Ogdensburg, had his resentencing adjourned without date after he violated his probation in September.
 Mr. Langstaff previously pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in an April plea deal with the district attorney’s office.
 The former Ogdensburg school building and grounds worker was originally charged with Mychael A. Kendall, 33, of 912 Franklin St., Ogdensburg, who was also employed in the city school system’s building and grounds department.
 St. Lawrence County Public Defender David Huber told the court Mr. Langstaff has been in a substance abuse treatment program and requested his resentencing be adjourned until the treatment program could provide a letter indicating an expected date of program completion.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that texts between the governor and Parnas were submitted with the impeachment evidence.
 Every politician beguiled by Rudy’s crew is under a cloud that grows more toxic with the exposure of characters such as Hyde, who’s transitioning professionally from tree-trimming to public relations.
 “I was never a close associate of Lev Parnas,” he stated last week. “Did I like his character, and did we have a lot of laughs and joke a little bit? Of course.”
 What a wit, that guy — kidding around about a surveillance team that’s supposedly tailing a U.S. ambassador, a woman he referred to as a “bitch.”
 A charitable assessment is that perhaps Hyde has some personal problems. According to the Washington Post, after spending nine days in the psychiatric facility last March, he went on social media saying “eff you and your intelligence agencies, whatever and whoever was or is effing with me.”
 A less kind view is that he’s just a nitwit fan-boy of Trump who somehow connected with Giuliani’s hapless mission to nail the Bidens in Ukraine.
 For the record, Hyde has posted that he’s finally taken care of his late child-support payments — another campaign negative — and that the Democrats and media are obviously out to get him.
 Nonetheless, the Republican Party in Connecticut has asked him to drop out of that Congressional race. Please.

New astronomy research from the University of Central Lancashire UCLan suggests that giant planets could form around small stars much faster than previously thought. Dr. Anthony Mercer and Dr. Dimitris Stamatellos new planet formation research, published in Astronomy and Astrophysics journal, challenges the understanding of planet formation.The research found that small stars in our galaxy like Red dwarfs, which are 10-15 per cent the size of our sun, are found to host giant planets up to 10 times bigger than Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. The mystery around the formation mechanism of these big planets remains unsolved.Giant planets around stars like our Sun are thought to have formed by the gradual build-up of dust particles to progressively bigger bodies. However, red dwarfs are tiny when compared to the Sun, and they do not seem to have enough material around them to form such big planets.The research team used the UK Distributed Research Advanced Computing DiRAC supercomputing facility to simulate the evolution of protoplanetary discs around red dwarf stars. Protoplanetary discs are rotating structures of dense gas and dust found around all newly born stars.If these young discs are big enough they can fragment, i.e., break up into pieces, forming gas giant planets, researchers suggested. This theory predicts that the formation of giant planets happens within a few thousand years, a timescale which is extremely fast in astrophysical terms.Dr. Mercer, who led the research, said The fact that planets may be able to form on such a short timescale around tiny stars is incredibly exciting. Our work shows that planet formation is particularly robust other worlds can form even around small stars in a variety of ways, and therefore planets may be more diverse than we previously thought. The researchers also found these planets are extremely hot when they form, with temperatures at their cores reaching thousands of degrees. Such hot planets would be relatively easy to observe when they are still young. They do not have an internal energy source, so they become fainter with time, and the window of opportunity to directly observe them is very small.Nevertheless, they can still be indirectly observed by their effect on their host star. Many planets like these have been discovered so far around small stars. Co-author of the research Dr. Stamatellos, an astrophysicist in UCLans Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, added This was the first time that we were able not only to see planets forming in computer simulations but also to determine their initial properties with great detail. It was fascinating to find that these planets are of the fast and furious kind -- they form quickly and they are unexpectedly hot. ANI
