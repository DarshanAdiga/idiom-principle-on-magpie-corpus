WASHINGTON (AP) — Beaten down by the coronavirus outbreak, the world economy in 2020 will suffer its worst year since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the International Monetary Fund says in its latest forecast.
 The IMF said Tuesday that it expects the global economy to shrink 3% this year — far worse than its 0.1% dip in the Great Recession year of 2009 — before rebounding in 2021 with 5.8% growth. It acknowledges, though, that prospects for a rebound next year are clouded by uncertainty.
 The bleak assessment represents a breathtaking downgrade by the IMF. In its previous forecast in January, before COVID-19 emerged as a grave threat to public health and economic growth worldwide, the international lending organization had forecast moderate global growth of 3.3% this year. But far- reaching measures to contain the pandemic — lockdowns, business shutdowns, social distancing and travel restrictions — have suddenly brought economic activity to a near-standstill across much of the world.
 “The world has been put in a great lockdown,’’ the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, told reporters. “This is a crisis like no other.”
 Gopinath said the cumulative loss to the global gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of economic output, could amount to $9 trillion — more than the economies of Germany and Japan combined.
 The IMF’s twice-yearly World Economic Outlook was prepared for this week’s spring meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. Those meetings, along with a gathering of finance ministers and central bankers of the world’s 20 biggest economies, will be held virtually for the first time in light of the coronavirus outbreak.

In our daily lives, it's easy to underestimate how much we depend on an easy daily routine, like where to get your favourite coffee in the morning, how much a kilogram of tomatoes costs, and where to get on the subway. The cost of living can also halve or double depending on which country you go to.
 "When I go to a place, you have to figure out what is the real price of a mango, am I getting the tourist price or is it the real price?" said Muller. "It's a bit more of a fight, let's say."
 ## There's pressure to succeed from back home
 There are also pressures from the people you leave behind, who expect a lot from those who move country to work, she said, especially if you move from a poorer country. One friend of Muller's moved from Tunisia to Canada, and his family and friends always ask him about his house, what car he has, and how successful he is.
 "Depression and anxiety don't need a visa, they can travel everywhere," Muller said. "It's harder to share with the people back home if you are struggling, that you are in a crisis, because they say 'How come? You live in Singapore, you have a house, you have a driver, you have a housekeeper, you have a nice job, you make money, what's the problem?'"
 It's the same for digital nomads -- people think working remotely around the world is living the dream. But Muller said everything comes with a catch, and it's not all beaches and being happy and carefree.

Meghan Clem, CEO of the wedding and party-planning company Intertwined Events, says she is hoping that some government loans come through so she can continue to pay her staff. The next two to three months will likely be the worst of the crisis for Intertwined Events.

 In Europe, the sudden downturn has spotlighted the vulnerabilities of the shared euro currency, whose members are still healing from a debt crisis in 2012-2015. The 19-country bloc lacks a powerful central treasury. And it's struggled to settle on a unified fiscal response, with northern European countries like the Netherlands and Germany blocking proposals for shared borrowing backed by all countries.
 The member countries did agree on what could amount to a half-trillion euros in stimulus. But conditions on part of the package mean that some of the money may never be tapped.
 Italy, which has been deeply hurt by the crisis, is expected to suffer a 9% drop this year in its gross domestic product, and its debt load could soar from an already high 135% of GDP. Fears have arisen of a renewed debt crisis, though for now, stimulus from the European Central Bank has calmed lending markets.
 European governments are deploying plans that subsidize worker pay at companies that have had to put employees on shorter hours or send them home. The idea is that companies keep workers on board so that they can quickly resume without having to recruit and train new staffers later. Their workers' spending also helps support other businesses. The system represents a sharp contrast to practices in the United States, where applications for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed.

"One of the biggest problems in psychology is engaging your patients, getting them to feel comfortable enough to trust you and work with you," she said. "And it got me thinking that maybe ASMR could be used to improve that, and kind of speed up that connection."
 Gray is now conducting a study on the reasons people seek out ASMR videos and what they like about them, whether they get the tingles or not.
 "I'm really hoping that this will enable us to kind of take ASMR from sort of a niche thing on YouTube to sort of an internationally recognized treatment," she said. "Because it is an international phenomenon. It's in every country. And it seems such a waste that it's not being used."
 The current working hypothesis is that ASMR triggers feel-good endorphins like dopamine, which can help improve mood in the short term. But in the long term, it needs to be combined with therapy that helps you to tackle why you feel bad in the first place.
 "One of the problems we have is when you see a patient, you can't make them feel better instantly," said Gray. "You say, 'I can help you, but you've got to hold on, you've got to wait two, three, four, five months until you feel better.' And that's too long if you've been suffering for so long."

"I find that ASMR is something of a cheat code for relaxation," he said. "While it might take you a while to sit down and get lost in a book or a TV show, the effects of ASMR are almost instant, like a soft, mental tranquilizer.
 "As soon as one of my favourite creators flutters their fingers, scratches a surface, or whispers softly, my eyes glaze over and the tension of quarantine life recedes like a tide."
 People all over the world are struggling to find a way to deal with their new- found isolation from friends and family, and anxiety levels that are running higher than ever.
 "Human beings don't like uncertainty, and it is really making things quite unmanageable," Dr Emma Gray, a psychologist and YouTuber told Insider. "There is obviously a physical risk to COVID-19, but the biggest risk outside of the financial and economic one is the psychological risk because people are cut off from their normal ways of coping."
 Whether your usual routine calls for keeping super busy, or sitting in a park, that's likely been taken away from you without much warning at all. ASMR could be a new tool to relax and stop the tossing and turning at night, Gray said, even for those who have never considered it before. That includes people who don't get the "brain orgasm."

Chairman Steve Hollis has branded Aston Villa's disastrous Premier League campaign as "unacceptably fractured both on and off the pitch".
 Villa's relegation to the Championship was confirmed on Saturday as Marcus Rashford secured a 1-0 win for Manchester United at Old Trafford.
 It completed a miserable season for Villa – who have played in every Premier League campaign since its inception in 1992 – that has seen Tim Sherwood and Remi Garde both fail to turn around their flailing fortunes.
 Villa's fans have regularly protested against the club's owner Randy Lerner for their fall from grace and that continued against United, but it was unable to stop them slipping out of the top flight with four games remaining.
 "First, on behalf of the board, let me express my deep regret that I find myself writing this open letter to you, knowing just how much hurt and pain, anger and anguish will have been felt by you all after the club lost its Premier League status this weekend," Hollis said in a statement published on Villa's official website.
 "Your profound sadness is shared by everyone connected with the club and while I know that will be of little consolation in the days ahead, it should be a source of reassurance as we rebuild the foundations for future successes.
 "We must acknowledge that this weekend's confirmation has been the culmination of an unacceptably fractured season both on and off the pitch. That isn't down to bad luck. To make such a claim would be insulting to each and every one of you. I must add you have all displayed unyielding commitment in adversity."
 However, Hollis – who was appointed in January – has vowed to inspire change at Villa Park, starting with the recruitment of their next permanent manager.
 He added: "While it is of little solace at present, the process of identifying the root causes of our circumstances started long ago and the focus now has to be looking forward and making sure lessons have been learnt.
 "The search for a new manager to provide drive, direction and immediate promotion has commenced.
 "Together, we share the same goal. We intend to restore Aston Villa Football Club to its rightful place. It is a journey we must make together so we can bring success, enjoyment and exciting football back to Villa Park once more."

But far-reaching measures to contain the pandemic — lockdowns, business shutdowns, social distancing and travel restrictions — have suddenly brought economic activity to a near-standstill across much of the world.The IMF's twice-yearly World Economic Outlook was prepared for this week's spring meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. Those meetings, along with a gathering of finance ministers and central bankers of the world's 20 biggest economies, are being held virtually for the first time in light of the coronavirus outbreak.In its latest outlook, the IMF expects economic contractions this year of 5.9% in the United States, 7.5% in the 19 European countries that share the euro currency, 5.2% in Japan and 6.5% in the United Kingdom. China, where the pandemic originated, is expected to eke out 1.2% growth this year. The world's second-biggest economy, which had gone into lockdown, has begun to open up well before other countries.Worldwide trade will plummet 11% this year, the IMF predicts, and and then grow 8.4% in 2021.Last week, the IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, warned that the world was facing "the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.'' She said that emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia were at especially high risk. And on Monday, the IMF approved $500 million to cancel six months of debt payments for 25 impoverished countries so they can help confront the pandemic.Just three months ago, the IMF had forecast that more than 160 countries would register income growth on a per-capita basis. Now, it expects negative per-capita income growth this year in 170 countries.The IMF cautioned Tuesday that its latest forecast is shrouded by unknowns. They include the path that the virus will take; the effectiveness of policies meant to contain the outbreak and minimize the economic damage; and uncertainty over whether, even many months from now, people will continue to isolate themselves and depress spending as a precaution against a potential resurgence of the virus.On a hopeful note, the IMF noted that economic policymakers in many countries have engineered what it calls a "swift and sizable'' response to the economic crisis. The United States, for instance, has enacted three separate rescue measures, including a $2.2 trillion aid package — the largest in history — that is meant to sustain households and businesses until the outbreak recedes and economic life begins to return to normal.That package includes direct payments to individuals, business loans, grants to companies that agree not to lay off workers and expanded unemployment benefits. And Congress is moving toward approving a possible fourth economic aid measure.Meghan Clem, CEO of the wedding and party-planning company Intertwined Events, says she is hoping that some government loans come through so she can continue to pay her staff. The next two to three months will likely be the worst of the crisis for Intertwined Events."All events have been canceled or postponed to the fourth quarter, so we are seeing a full stop of revenue for May, June and likely July," said Clem, whose company is based in Irvine, California.Some countries can't afford sufficiently aggressive rescue plans, the IMF said, and "may require external support." Georgieva has said that the IMF is prepared to commit its $1 trillion in lending capacity to support nations that need help in dealing with the pandemic.The IMF is also calling on countries to work cooperatively to fight the pandemic."Countries urgently need to work together to slow the spread of the virus and to develop a vaccine and therapies to counter the disease,'' the lending agency said.___AP Business Writer Joyce M.

India should overhaul its tax system and lower rates for all individual taxpayers to 15-20 per cent, B2B payment solutions provider PayMates CFO Ravi Vishvanathan has said. He said that post COVID-19 pandemic, global trade would be on the mend again and there is a major re-think on depending solely on China for supply chain procurement and India is ideally placed to grab the opportunity. Vishvanathan further said dedicated corridors can be created for manufacture of specific products like shoes, sports equipment and toys, with tax incentives for incremental export and additional employment generated. India should seriously look at a major overhaul and reform of its tax system, he said in an article titled How a Reformed Tax System can drive Make in India. He said India should lower the tax rate for all taxpayers to a maximum rate of 15-20 per cent and remove all deductions. He also suggested abolishing the angel tax on startups and long term capital gains LTCG on sale of listed shares to better investor sentiment. Stating that Make in India can be a huge success only when the domestic entrepreneurs are confident of smooth operations without constant knock on their doors by taxmen, Vishvanathan said there should be no inspectionvisit by tax officers. He said startups and other companies continue to incur losses or operate on very low margins and face a huge cashflow issue due to tax deduction from their revenue. Certificate for lowerzero rate for deduction of tax should be given on self-declaration without any intervention, specially to loss making companies, Vishvanathan said. He also said that tax authorities should now reform and simplify the Goods and Services Tax GST, especially in sectors like automobile and real estate.

All gyms and fitness studios in Washington closed in late-March, when Gov. Jay Inslee’s stay-at-home order to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus took effect. Since then, socially starved Seattleites have migrated online for everything from happy hour to fitness classes.
 This shift online has presented local fitness studios with many challenges: what platform to use, how to register members, how to ensure members have the right equipment, how to stay in business. Here’s how some have adapted and shifted gears to continue helping members stay fit and retain their connections to their gym communities in a very chaotic time.
 Like many other fitness studio owners, Dora Gyarmati, who has owned Spira Power Yoga for 25 years, moved all her classes to Zoom, a teleconferencing service, and set up online scheduling.

ASMR is simply a feeling
 Relaxing is a skill, said Gray, so it takes time to learn to do it effectively. That's why some people may find ASMR irritating at first -- they battle their subconscious with the power dynamic of truly letting go.
 "If you have been struggling with anxiety over an extended period of time, you've got chronically high levels of stress hormone cortisol in your system, and it's quite hard to relax," she said. "So if you are watching the videos for the first time and you are in quite a stressed-out state, I would always recommend you just sit and listen, with no expectations."
 Satori recommends looking up "ASMR triggers" and "how to get ASMR" on YouTube as a place to start. But she said to also be wary as the community is very over-saturated right now with creators who don't necessarily have their viewers' best interests at heart.
 There's a lot of incorrect stigma around ASMR being sexual, or weird, or about eating live animals, and Satori wants people to know it's none of those things. It's simply "a feeling" some people seek because they're in need of some "purring" more than others.
 "I just want people to truly know that ASMR is not just a trend," Satori said. "It truly is helpful. It can be healing. It can be what you want it to be. And I really just think if you can have an open mind and go into ASMR and give it a chance, you could really find that it could help you."
