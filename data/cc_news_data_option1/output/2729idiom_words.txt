This stage of populating the NBA’s bubble is of critical importance and comes with considerable apprehension baked into it. Despite the league’s persistent belief that life on the campus will be safer than anywhere else NBA personnel could be outside it, there is no diminishing the daunting nature of erecting and controlling a single-site environment for more than 300 players on a scale that has never been attempted.
 “We have to get there,” Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers said of the looming check-in step. “You’re almost nervous about that.”
 Yet it is also true, with apologies to Popovich, that teams (and especially coaches) can’t help but look a step or two ahead to the weekend and the return of full-speed group practices.

Breakfast, of course, is far from the only issue here (even if it has felt like the one most consistently cited by players). Coaches will have to coax high-level performances from players who may be happier crawling back under the covers. Players who are accustomed to having a full day to prepare mentally and physically for a match may risk sleepwalking onto the field, dew underfoot, with bed head and morning breath.
 “None of the guys were really happy about it,” said Matt Real, 20, a defender for the Philadelphia Union, who beat NYCFC, 1-0, on Thursday morning. “The earliest we ever play is 1:30, and even that’s strange for guys.”
 Preparations for a 9 a.m. kickoff, then, start several days in advance. Ronny Deila, the coach of NYCFC, scheduled practices at 8 a.m. for the past week, hoping to gradually roll back his players’ internal clocks.
