Consistent with China’s toughening policies toward its neighbors, four members of the opposition in the Hong Kong legislature were ousted last week, which led to wholesale resignations that have left Hong Kong’s governing council under the total control of pro-Beijing hardliners.
 The era of “one country, two systems” for Hong Kong, dating to the transfer of sovereignty by Great Britain, appears to be over. The dissidents and demonstrators who filled the streets just months ago appear to have been routed, and the city’s future looks less like the Hong Kong of yesterday than the Beijing of tomorrow.
 These actions are consistent with the hard lines Beijing has taken on its “reeducation camps” for Uighurs in Xinjiang and its border dispute with India in the Himalayas.
 While Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has lately sought to round up like-minded nations to stand up to China — Japan, Australia, India — there appears to be a reluctance, rooted in uncertainty as to whether Communist China or democratic America represents the future of Asia.
 Trump’s “America First” policy asked the most basic of questions:
 Are all these half-century old alliances, these commitments to go to war for Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, as in Joe Biden’s estimation, assets to be nurtured and even expanded to cover more territories like the Senkakus? Or are they liabilities that could drag us into wars the American people do not want to fight?
 While we reject China’s claim to all the reefs, rocks and islets in the South China Sea and her claim to the Senkakus in the East China Sea, should we be obligated to go to war over these tiny parcels of land, especially when their legitimate owners are unwilling to fight for them?
 Biden repudiates an “America First” foreign policy that puts U.S. security, sovereignty, liberty and vital interests above the interests of any other nation.
 But what is it, then, that Biden puts first?
 Globalism. A New World Order. A Crusade for Global Democracy.
 Been there, done that.
 Sixty years ago when Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy faced off, the foreign policy debate was over whether the U.S. should fight Mao’s China to defend the tiny offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu.
 Kennedy thought not. Kennedy won.

But that takes money, which is why Turner is “turning over every rock” to find people who want to invest in a team, and a dream. His goal is to find 10,000 people to donate $20.24 (a nod to the Olympic year). Based on a proposed budget of $80,000 per year, that would roughly fund the senior team from now until the Olympics — “and then we could go after all the other stuff.”
 “When I first got the job, I wanted to have something that we could point toward and talk about," Turner said. “Just a goal that is out there for us. Something that is meaningful and history making. No Jamaica basketball team has ever made the Olympics.
 “So I truly believe we have the talent to do it. I’ve been around the country long enough to say that with confidence. And knowing the players that are involved. I know that it’s doable. I don’t want the money thing to hold us back. I don’t want that to be the reason why we don’t do it.”
 Jamaica’s most famous hoopster, of course, is Patrick Ewing, who has an Olympic gold medal — for the U.S. Turner eventually wants to get Ewing involved, but he is leery of approaching him for financial help.
 “I don’t want to be that guy to meet Patrick Ewing with my hand out," he said. “I think when we do the things we want to do, and not just talk about them, then he’ll jump on board 100 percent, I’m confident of that. And I think a lot of other people will, too.”
 That’s all part of Turner’s dream for the magical day when Jamaican hoopsters will be dribbling up and down the basketball court in Paris. For someone who has chosen to devote much of his life to that pursuit, it would be cool runnings, indeed.

“Folklore” is likely to compete for the top prize, and gives the singer a chance to be the first act to win album of the year three times after doing so with “1989” and “Fearless.”
 Swift will likely earn a song of the year nod for “Cardigan” and could even compete in other genre categories outside of pop since her album has sounds from folk to alternative, though those genre committees may block her from competing in their categories so that lesser-known musicians have a stronger chance of winning.
 ________
 WEEKND AT HARRY’S
 Leading pop it boy Harry Styles will become the first One Direction member to compete at the Grammys, thanks to the success of his second solo album and the smash hit, “Watermelon Sugar.”
 Styles is expected to earn nominations like album of the year and best pop vocal album for “Fine Line,” while his No. 1 hit will earn nods for record of the year, song of the year and best pop solo performance.
 The Weeknd, the owner of three Grammys, will score nominations for album of the year with “After Hours” as well as song and record of the year for “Blinding Lights,” which is spending its 39th week in the Top 10 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart and its 35th week at No. 1 on the R&B; charts. The Weeknd could compete with Roddy Ricch for the top nominee title since he will also vie for pop and R&B; awards, and maybe even best music video.
 ________
 OTHER TOP ALBUM NOMINEES
 Others who may score nominations for album of the year are Fiona Apple’s “Fetch the Bolt Cutters,”  Tame Impala’s “The Slow Rush" and Luke Combs’ “What You See Is What You Get.” Since there are eight slots, Lady Gaga’s “Chromatica” and “Future Nostalgia” by Dua Lipa — who won two Grammys in 2019 including best new artist — could join the club of nominees.
 ________
 GRANDE’s GRAMMYS
 While Ariana Grande’s “Positions” album and single will compete at the 2022 Grammys, she could earn nominations for her collaborations with Lady Gaga (“Rain on Me”) and Justin Bieber (“Stuck With U”). The duets will likely compete for best pop duo/group performance but could even earn nominations for record or song of the year.
 ________
 SAYING NO TO “SAY SO”?
 Though she's a controversial figure in music, it’s hard to deny rapper-singer Doja Cat’s successful year. She topped the charts with “Say So,” launched another platinum success with “Like That” and has been the go-to performer to guest star on songs, appearing on tracks this year by The Weeknd, Ariana Grande, Lil Wayne, City Girls, Anne-Marie, Chloe x Halle and more. She’s also earned multiple nominations at all the major music awards show, including the BET Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, American Music Awards and Billboard Music Awards.
 “Say So” will likely earn a nomination for best pop solo performance and help Doja Cat pick up a best new artist bid, but nominations for song and record of the year may be tricky. If “Say So” is nominated in the top categories, it would give a nomination to Dr. Luke, who co-wrote and produced the song and has been in a yearslong legal battle with Kesha, who accused him of sexual assault during their partnership. Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations and he was last nominated at the 2014 Grammys.

It’s the job of the activist left to push political limits, staking out positions that sound radical today but could, with enough work, seem like common sense in the future. But in the short term, an assertive left that garners national attention can threaten the political survival of Democrats who answer to a more conservative electorate.
 In a postelection interview with The New York Times’ Astead Herndon, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed frustration with those who are blaming leftists for Democrats’ down-ballot losses. “Progressive policies do not hurt candidates,” she insisted, noting swing-district Democrats who had co- sponsored Medicare for All legislation and the Green New Deal, and had kept their seats.
 But most candidates who endorsed those initiatives were in safer districts than those who didn’t. When moderate Democrats like Conor Lamb and Abigail Spanberger say that left-wing slogans are poisonous in their communities, people who don’t live in those communities should take them seriously.
 Left-wing populists often believe that there’s a silent majority who agree with them, if only they can be organized to go to the polls. If that were true, though, an election with record high turnout should have been much better for progressives. Instead, 2020 was a reminder of something most older liberals long ago had to come to terms with: The voters who live in the places that determine political control in this country tend to be more conservative than we are.
 Yet that doesn’t mean that the Democratic Party doesn’t need the left. Leaders like Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were loyal soldiers in this election. After the primaries, they put aside their disappointment to rally voters whom Joe Biden might not have reached. One analysis showed that voting by young people was up 8% in 2020, and after the coronavirus, the issues young Biden voters cared about most were racism and climate change. The Democratic Party can’t afford to alienate the people inspired by Sanders and the Squad.
 The Democrats’ loss in 2004 was devastating, but recovering from it didn’t mean moving right. At the time, even civil unions for gay couples were controversial — the Ohio ballot initiative was one of several that banned them along with same-sex marriage. Agitation for marriage equality turned support for such unions into the moderate liberal position, then into the centrist position. Then marriage equality became the law of the land.
 Similarly, the Green New Deal made a climate plan like Biden’s, the most ambitious ever proposed by a major party presidential nominee, look moderate. Calls to defund the police are unpopular, but the slogan has already made other reforms — like changing the law to make it easier to hold police officers liable for misconduct — seem centrist and practical.
 Moderates need radicals to expand their scope for action. Radicals need moderates to wield power in a giant heterogenous country with sclerotic institutions and deep wells of reaction. Neither camp could have defeated President Donald Trump on its own. It’s frustrating now, as it was heartbreaking in 2004, that revanchist Republicans retain such a hold on America. But that’s all the more reason for Democrats to stop their counterproductive sniping and work together to beat them.

 # Greenville golfer Bill Haas tests positive for COVID-19

 Greenville’s Bill Haas, a longtime member of the PGA Tour, has tested positive for COVID-19.
 Haas tested positive on Tuesday as part of the Tour’s pre-tournament screening for the RSM Classic at Sea Island, Georgia, and has been withdrawn from the event, the PGA Tour announced. That tournament tees off on Thursday.
 “It’s obviously disappointing news to receive,” Haas said. “But my focus is now on recovery and ensuring the health and well-being of my family.”
 Haas, a 38-year-old Riverside High and Wake Forest alumnus and the son of Champions Tour member Jay Haas, has been a member of the PGA Tour since 2004 and has six Tour wins to his credit. A 2003 Walker Cup team member, Haas has more than $30 million in career earnings.

Things change once you start lowering seats, however.

This lets you quickly transform your van from people carrier to stuff hauler without giving yourself a hernia lifting seats out. The downside is that the seats themselves aren't as comfortable as the second-row captain's chairs found in rivals – or those in the Pacifica Hybrid, which doesn't have Stow 'N Go (its battery takes up the underfloor stowage space). Note that the Pacifica's eight-passenger configuration adds a small seat between the captain's chairs that does need to be physically removed.

In some respects, the surge in Newsmax’s viewership represents a temper tantrum by some Fox viewers, she said.
 For Newsmax, a big question is whether its programming is compelling enough to hold viewers who are clearly sampling. Besides Kelly, former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer is Newsmax's best-known personality. Both their shows are aired twice a night; Ruddy said a new prime-time show will start next month and another is in the works.
 “It's going to be a challenge for (Newsmax) to grow their numbers in the way that Fox did because of the lack of a news operation,” Hemmer said.
 The Wall Street Journal reported last weekend that Trump allies in Hicks Equity Partners had discussed acquiring and investing in Newsmax TV. Ruddy said it never materialized into anything. He said he's not looking to sell, but will listen if an investor approaches with an open checkbook.
 For conservative media, the overshadowing mystery is what Trump decides to do when he leaves office, whether he decides to start a media organization of his own or join an existing one.
 Ruddy professes no insider knowledge, but said he doubts Trump would want to start his own company because it would cut him off from access to other media.
 He doesn't think Trump would be interested in doing a daily show. Perhaps weekly, he said, and Newsmax would be interested in having him.

The U.S. spends $4 billion a year on Afghanistan’s National Security and Defense Forces, yet relentless violence in the country has been demoralizing and U.S. air power has been the key to the ability of Afghan forces to hold territory against Taliban onslaughts.
 Afghanistan’s security forces also have been degraded by corruption. According to an August report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, about half of all police in the Taliban strongholds of the southern provinces use drugs and up to 70% of police positions in those regions are “ghost” jobs — in which they are not actually filled but the salaries are diverted to officials on the take.
 The U.S. troop withdrawal seems certain to feature prominently in the first visit to Afghanistan on Thursday of Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan. The neighbors have an uneasy relationship, with Kabul accusing Islamabad of strengthening the Taliban by harboring its leadership. Pakistan says Afghanistan has become the staging arena for Indian-sponsored attacks on its soil.

“Every time I thought maybe my story had ended, or my path had reached an end, something else sort of presented itself," Turner said.
 After attending Bellevue College and Western Washington University, Turner was hired by the Sonics in 1989 as an intern. It began as a lowest-rung position in game operations and promotions, but Turner eventually wound up as an assistant to scouting director Gary Wortman and later the director of broadcasting.
 Whatever he was doing, Turner was in heaven being around hoops — and slowly made a mark with the Sonics. He seized the opportunity whenever he could to help coach George Karl in practice, whether it was keeping score, running the clock or rebounding for a player taking extra shots.
 “I was just kind of around," said Turner, who forged relationships with people such as then-assistant coach Dwane Casey that later would help further his career.
 Meanwhile, Turner caught the coaching bug while helping out the boys program at Mercer Island High School under legendary coach Ed Pepple. All his life Turner had heard people say that you should “follow your passion.” So he did. And his passion was undeniable: basketball.
 “This lightbulb went on," he said. “I just decided out of the blue to sort of quit (the Sonics) and go for it.”

 Garaufis was not impressed, calling it a "sad and inappropriate use of executive authority to keep DACA recipients & DACA-eligible individuals (from accessing protections)."
 Garaufis also read aloud the statement put out by DHS calling him an "activist judge" and cited Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who recommended Garaufis for the court: "You're entitled to your own opinions, you're not entitled to your own facts."

Apple on Wednesday said it plans to start a program to lower its App Store commissions for software developers who make $1 million or less in proceeds each year from the store. Apple takes a 30% cut of most purchases made on the App Store, although the commission drops to 15% for subscriptions that remain active for more than a year. Apple said Wednesday developers will automatically get the lower 15% rate if they generate $1 million or less in proceeds - defined as the portion of App Store purchases that the developer keeps - in a calendar year. Apple's App Store fees and rules have come under fire from both large software firms such as Microsoft, Spotify and Match Group as well as numerous startups and smaller companies that allege the fees deprive consumers of choices and push up the price of apps. Apple has responded by saying its rules apply evenly to developers and that the App Store provides an easy way to reach its huge base of users without having to set up payment systems in the 175 countries where it operates. Apple said the new program will start on Jan. 1, 2021. Software developers who netted less than $1 million from the App Store this year will qualify for the 15% rate next year. If the developer's proceeds rise above the $1 million threshold the next year, Apple's standard rates kick in for the rest of that year. If the developer's proceeds fall below $1 million in a given year, they become eligible for the lower rate the next year. Small businesses are the backbone of our global economy and the beating heart of innovation and opportunity in communities around the world, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a statement. Apple said it will give more details on which developers qualify next month.

Measurements were taken twice at the beginning, middle and end of the season both before exercise and soon after. The study found a slight decrease in hematocrit, an increase in hemoglobin concentration over the course of the season, slight increases in white blood cell count and, notably, major red blood cell count increases.

MILTON, Ga. — Farm wineries resurfaced as a topic of debate at the Milton City Council meeting Nov. 16 with the board tabling a proposed use permit some argued would essentially allow a bar to operate on agricultural property.
 The use permit would allow farm wineries that operate within Milton to serve beer and liquor for on-site consumption.
 The issue was spurred by a request from the city’s only farm winery, The Painted Horse Winery at the Farm at Pamelot, to sell beer and liquor in addition to wine.
 Since the winery opened in 2019, city officials and the Painted Horse’s operators have been in discussions on the city’s alcohol codes. Owner Pamela Jackson has said the state’s laws related to farm wineries are far more lenient than Milton’s regulations. For its part, Milton has made several updates to its alcohol ordinances to allow the Painted Horse to expand its offerings, including a recent decision to allow the sale of wines manufactured outside of Georgia.
 However, city officials have been less receptive to granting farm wineries, which are only permitted on agricultural properties, the ability to sell beer and spirits for on-site consumption.
 Jackson had sought the permit earlier this year, which prompted city officials to bring the discussion before the council. The Painted Horse has since withdrawn its interest in the permit, Zoning Manager Robyn MacDonald said, but the City Council elected to continue discussing the matter for any future farm wineries in the city.
 The proposal has already met resistance from residents and some city representatives. The Planning Commission voted 4-2 in September to recommend denial of the use permit over concerns it would essentially allow a bar to operate in an agricultural area and would be a “slippery slope.”
 Mimi Sullivan, who lives near the Painted Horse, said the winery resembles an event space “in terms of noise and traffic congestion.” She also had concerns of road safety near the site and worried about adding “alcohol to the mix.”
 Councilwoman Laura Bentley said she has received numerous comments from people who live near the site and are opposed to the permit.
 “Since we have just one (farm winery) and it is new to the city, I would be prepared to deny this,” Bentley said. “I do think it’s a disservice to the neighbors to defer endlessly because they would not know the status of this option. That’s where I am on this.”
 Bentley was the only dissenting vote on a motion to withdraw the proposal.
 Several council members said because there was no current request for the permit, they should send it back to city staff for further tweaks and reconsider the matter at a later date.
 Bentley said she could not see any changes to the proposal that would sway her opinion from denial.
 Another agenda item to add farm wineries to agricultural-type land uses under the Milton Rural Overlay was also withdrawn.

The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $10,582 million, long-term debt of $5,447.2 million and shareholders’ equity of $5,566.8 million.      During the fiscal third quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $4.1 billion. The company expects to reinstate a quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. It expects to announce a divided of 26 cents per share, which suggests 13% increase from previous dividend paid in March, 2020.      Total inventories as of Oct 31, 2020, were $5 billion, down from $6.3 billion in the year-ago period. The decline can be attributed to reduced planned store inventory levels, better-than-expected sales in the quarter as well as delay in merchandise delivery owing to continued bottlenecks in the supply chain. The company is concentrating its inventory purchases on categories that are witnessing higher demand since store reopening. In fact, management is optimistic about its capabilities to ship a fresh assortment of gifts to its stores and online all along the holiday season.

A new production of Tom Dent’s 1978 play “Ritual Murder” brings together two generations of New Orleans Black arts activists to honor the influential New Orleans writer.
 Dent’s one-act play centers on an act of violence in a 9th Ward bar that leaves one man dead and another behind bars. The playwright examines the social forces behind the violence and reveals a community that is ultimately complicit in the untimely fate of both men.
 “It still connects,” said artist and activist Chakula cha Jua, who directed the play’s original production over 40 years ago. “The whole problem of the play is still a problem. It hasn’t really changed. That’s what makes the piece so valuable.”
 “Ritual Murder” caps off this year’s Words & Music Literary Festival, running Nov. 19-22. The festival is organized by One Book One New Orleans, a community campaign that each year promotes public discourse around a single book.
 This year’s selection, “New Orleans Griot: The Tom Dent Reader,” edited by Kalamu ya Salaam, collects the work of the late author remembered for his commitment to civil rights. The festival’s “Day of Dent” will feature a panel discussion, a poetry workshop, and a staged reading of “Ritual Murder” presented virtually by No Dream Deferred, a New Orleans theater company committed to spotlighting work from historically marginalized playwrights.

Unfortunately, close to two years into his second tenure, Nigerians now know better.

With an insecure nation where corruption has eaten deep into its fabric plus an ailing economy, the country appears way out in the woods. It is even more worrisome that harvesters can longer sleep with their two eyes closed as they are caught in- between the devil and the deep blue sea - to either leave their farm produce for rodents or pay armed bandits before they can harvest in peace. What is the use of government if it cannot protect lives and livelihoods? Why does government encourage farming when it cannot protect farmers from bandits?

I swear I was going to write this column without mentioning "Cool Runnings" or the Jamaican bobsled team. It seemed too obvious.
 But then Rick Turner, a Seattle basketball lifer who has taken on the ambitious task of leading Jamaica’s men's national basketball team to the 2024 Olympics — and sustaining success with a pipeline of youth programs — brought it up, unsolicited.
 “The Jamaica brand, there’s a coolness to it. It resonates with people," Turner said. “Even a guy like me can’t ruin the coolness of it. I think it’s natural for people to want to root for Jamaica.”
 After delving into this project, and learning more about Turner’s tireless efforts to make it succeed as the coach and national coordinator, count me among those rooting for Team Jamaica. The Jamaican men's national team, established in 1962, has never made it to either the FIBA Basketball World Cup or the Olympics, but Turner is steadfast that he can accomplish the former in 2023, and then achieve the big prize: A spot in the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.
 “Now it’s time to put up or shut up," Turner said. “I want to take on the challenge, and I think we can do it. I’m confident we can do it.”
 The path that took Turner, 52, from playing varsity hoops at Lake Washington High School in Kirkland in the 1980s to landing the Team Jamaica coaching job in 2019 is a fascinating one, full of twists and turns and a few potential roadblocks he plowed through.

 # Pruitt Planning to Wait on Saturday for Vols Starting QB to be Revealed
 Matthew Ray
 ! 
 Tennessee's depth chart was released earlier this week, and there was little change across the board. The most talked about piece on there was the quarterback position staying the same, however, if you have followed the Vols depth chart releases this fall, you know that you should not put too much stock into them . Shawn Shamburger was listed as the starter at the Star position for the first two weeks of the season, but he was not out there with the team.
 It is no surprise that Jeremy Pruitt chose not to reveal anything different about Tennessee's quarterback heading into the matchup against Auburn.
 Pruitt was asked today about the quarterback situation, and he said, Well, I’m going to wait and let that show itself on Saturday, you know? With Jarrett going down at the last game and obviously being out, we worked a lot of guys. I don’t think it does us an advantage to tell Auburn who we’re going to play at quarterback.”
 Earlier in the week, Pruitt said on the quarterback situation, "Jarrett practiced, but all the other guys took a lot of reps over the last three practices, so we’ll see how the rest of the week goes here. I was real excited about how these other guys continue to work, and I thought Jarrett had a good day Sunday. To me, it seems to be a little more confidence offensively, especially with our younger guys, just having a better idea to how to execute at a higher level.”
 He was asked about Bailey's growth later over the open week later in the press conference, and he said, "When you are comfortable doing something, running an offense, whatever it is, you have confidence, right? Your peers can see it. You can’t fake confidence. It’s either natural or it’s not. And that’s not to take anything away from him, but the more you do something, the more comfortable you get at it and the better you feel and the more confident you are, and you can see that — the simplicity of communicating the calls, all the way across the board.
