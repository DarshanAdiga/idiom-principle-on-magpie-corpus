It allowed the 78-year-old to walk free from jail, ending the case of the most senior figure accused in the global scandal of historical sex abuse that has rocked the Roman Catholic Church.

These slovenly men and women cram every inch of space in unreserved coaches of hundreds of trains that chug out of stations in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar each day, headed for big cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Some of the trains snake through several states to reach cities and towns in Kerala in the south and Kashmir in the north.
 There they build giant structures whose rooftops appear kissing the sky, roads that gleam in sunlight. They supply milk and also clean sewers standing neck- deep in filth as people pass by, their nose covered in handkerchief and eyebrows knitted with disdain. Sweated labour is easy to forget. These migrant workers get walloped by goons patronised by political parties pandering to regional sentiments in Mumbai and are felled by terrorists bullets in Kashmir.
 To their pleasant surprise, the Odisha government has given them a new nameguest workersto give labour the dignity it deserves. Arrangements have been made to give shelter and food to these people who belong neither here nor there.
 In all 56,926 guest workers are living in 1,882 camps where they are not only getting food and other basic amenities but are also regularly examined by doctors, said Odisha governments COVID-19 spokesman Subroto Bagchi. Little children accompanying them are also given milk and fruits.
 The Odisha government has opened a call centre (Shramik Sahayata)- 18003456703- for guest workers in need, Bagchi said. Apart from food and accommodation, the state government is also providing psycho-social counselling to them through mobile health units.
 These migrants workers are mostly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra. With over two lakh Odia workers stranded in other states following the nationwide lockdown, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had requested his counterparts to take care of them and promised his government will bear the expenses incurred by those states.

 I want to encourage you, our community members, not only to stay home, but also to stay calm and stay connected as we find ourselves facing this pandemic, COVID-19.
 As the governor noted and we have witnessed in our community, many are choosing to stay home already, but we can do better. We can't medicate or ventilate our way out of a pandemic.
 A virus is an opportunist ready to use the unprepared and ill-informed, but it is not smart. It certainly is not as smart as we are as a community. Simply don't spread this virus and we all win.
 Even if you are not a high-risk individual, stay home for your family, friends and neighbors and the well-being of our community. Your efforts to distance from each other will slow the spread of COVID-19.
 This is a basic virus and stops if we do not spread it. Wash your hands. Do not travel. Do not arrange family gatherings, group visits or play dates. If a new person from other parts of the country joins your family, use a 14-day quarantine.
 Our individual efforts will pay off.
 Remember the goal is to slow the infection rate enough to buy time ­time to manufacture protective gear and equipment, time to work on medicines and/or a vaccine and time to allow the health system to adjust and catch up.
 It can be easy to panic at times like these, but I urge you to stay calm and follow the advice of the experts. Carris Health - Redwood hospital and clinic staff as well as EMS, public health and other emergency preparedness organizations meet regularly to plan, prepare and respond. Your medical providers are working to provide as much care by a phone call or a video visit as we can to care for you from the safety of your home.
 We will help you sort through problems as they occur. We are also increasing infection prevention measures within our buildings in a variety of ways, including limiting visitors, screening all patients at the door (clinic and hospital) and offering a nurse triage line for potential COVID-19 patients to call before coming in (507-637-1730).
 I ask that you please be patient with us. This is new territory for all, and we are working furiously to do our best for you. Lastly, please stay connected.
 Check in with reliable news sources like CarrisHealth.com, the CDC, Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
 I encourage you to limit all other news consumption to once or twice per day and then turn it off. Instead, check in with the family and friends and especially frail and elderly around you.
 Ensure they are okay and help them if you can do it safely. One person getting groceries for a group of vulnerable people is better than all going. We will get through this together.
 On behalf of your friends and neighbors at Carris Health - Redwood.

El presidente iraní, Hasán Rohani, exhortó el miércoles al Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) a concederle a su país, entre los más afectados por el nuevo coronavirus, un préstamo de urgencia de 5.000 millones de dólares que había pedido para luchar contra la pandemia.
 "Exhorto a todas las organizaciones internacionales a asumir sus responsabilidades", dijo Rohani durante el consejo de ministros.
 "Somos un miembro del FMI (...). Si hubiera discriminación entre Irán y otros para la concesión de créditos, ni nosotros ni la opinión pública general no lo toleraría", añadió, en unas declaraciones retransmitidas por la televisión.
 Irán anunció el 12 de marzo haber recurrido al FMI, a quién, de forma muy excepcional, Teherán dijo haber pedido ayuda contra la COVID-19.
 Teherán no ha recibido más ayuda del FMI desde un crédito que se le concedió entre 1960 y 1962, antes de la proclamación de la República Islámica en 1979, según datos de la institución.
 "Nuestro banco central pidió acceso inmediato" a un Instrumento de Financiación Rápida (IFR) del FMI, declaró el 12 de marzo el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Mohamad Javad Zarif, en Twitter.
 Según la página web del Fondo, el IFR "ofrece ayuda financiera rápida a todos los países miembros que la necesitan urgentemente".
 "Si no cumplen con sus obligaciones en esta difícil situación, el mundo los juzgará de otra manera", advirtió Rohani.
 Irán afirma que el nuevo coronavirus ha matado a más de 3.800 personas y ha infectado a más de 62.500 en todo el país. Pero, desde el extranjero, se cuestionan estos datos oficiales publicados por las autoridades iraníes y se barajan estimaciones mucho más elevadas.

Acting Secretary of the US Navy, Thomas Modly, resigned on Tuesday after he was forced to step down for firing an aircraft carrier captain, who had alarmed the high-ranking officials about a novel coronavirus outbreak on board and pleaded for help. Modly's resignation comes a little more than a week after Capt. Brett Crozier, the then-commanding officer of USS Theodore Roosevelt, sent a memo warning of coronavirus spreading among the sailors on the aircraft carrier. The memo leaked and Modly subsequently removed Crozier from command.
 Modly flew to Guam to address the ship, insulting Crozier to thousands of sailors who had given their former captain a standing ovation as he left the ship days before, CNN reported. The audio of that address was leaked to media outlets and the uproar over Modly's remarks -- calling Crozier "too naive or too stupid" to be in command of the aircraft carrier and saying that going outside of the chain-of-command with his memo represented a "betrayal" -- quickly made his position untenable.
 In his resignation letter, Modly, however, did not mention the controversy but later apologized to the whole of the Navy for the incident in a memo. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said in a letter that he accepted Modly's resignation on Tuesday morning.
 "I apologize for any confusion this choice of words may have caused," he wrote in a written apology, adding "I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused." Crozier sent a five-page internal letter last week to higher-ranking officials in the chain of command, pleading for help from the Pentagon to contain a COVID-19 outbreak aboard the Roosevelt by transferring 90 per cent of the crew onto Guam for quarantine. The letter led to his removal announced last Thursday by Modly.
 "I believe, precisely because he is not naive and stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship," Modly wrote Monday, backtracking from his previous assertions. "Sadly, Acting Secretary Modly's actions and words demonstrate his failure to prioritize the force protection of our troops," Pelosi said in a written statement Tuesday. "He showed a serious lack of the sound judgment and strong leadership needed during this time. Acting Secretary Modly must be removed from his position or resign."
 Some 173 sailors on board the Roosevelt tested positive for the novel coronavirus as of Monday, including Crozier himself, according to media reports. Approximately 2,000 of the roughly 5,000 crew members have disembarked the ship, nearing the 2,700 tally planned for evacuation due to the virus outbreak. Acting Undersecretary of the Army James McPherson has been tapped to succeed Modly in an acting capacity, Xinhua news agency reported after citing several American media outlets. (ANI)

 "At 11 o'clock the Lord Mayor of Manchester issued a bulletin announcing that the prime minister was progressing satisfactorily, but was staying in bed."
 By that evening, influenza was confirmed.
 The Western Mail reported that a notable local physician, Sir William Milligan, had said Lloyd George was "suffering from an attack of influenza, accompanied by high temperature and complicated with sore throat, and is at present confined to bed, and is, therefore, obliged to cancel all appointments".
 Although it was reported that Lloyd George's confinement was a "precautionary measure", he was in fact breathing with the help of a respirator, and his valet, Newnham, later described the prime minister's condition that morning as "touch and go".

He is also survived by his stepmother Kathy OBrien of Conway S.C, cousins, aunts and his Godson Paul C. OBrien and many friends from every walk of life. Paul will be sorely missed by his beloved cat Culinary. Paul will be fondly remembered by many for his infectious voice, hearty laughs, strong handshakes, kind words and his empathy and his true caring for others. He was an avid motorcycle enthusiast, especially Harley Davidsons. Paul was an avid fan of all Boston based sports teams, loved animals and loved to talk sports and to hear about anything anyone had on their mind. Paul was an exceptional chef. He started in the industry by washing dishes at the age of 13 at the former Boston Fish House. Through hard work and dedication to his craft, he had rose to the level of Sous Chef and managing the finest country clubs. The family wishes to convey their gratitude to Wellesley Dialysis Center for their compassionate care during Pauls prolonged illness. Paul is free of pain now and has joined Gods kingdom of eternal life. He is seated along with the many of who have gone before him and will be forever in our hearts. So long Paul and we thank you for filling our lives with such fond memories. Due to the pandemic, a celebration of Pauls life will be held at a later date.

Economists at SBI on Wednesday said a bulk of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore coronavirus aid package announced by the Cecludes budgeted elements and pitched for a Rs 3 lakh crore top-up to help the economy tide over the COVID-19-related challenges.Only Rs 73,000 crore of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month is fresh money as the rest was already budgeted for, the economists said, adding a &quot;large fiscal package&quot; for affected industries&quot; is necessary at this point.The already sagging economic growth is expected to go down further due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a three-week lockdown across the country starting March 25. Some analysts believe GDP growth will come at 2 per cent for FY21.&quot;... given labour and capital income loss of around Rs 3.60 lakh crore, the minimum subsistence fiscal package must be scaled up by Rs 3 lakh crore, over and above the incremental Rs 73,000 crore that was unleashed in the first phase,&quot; an SBI economist said in a note.The note said 98 per cent of the banking system's outstanding credit is in the 284 districts of the country affected by the COVID-19 and asked for needful attention to be given to the banking system.Joining other watchers, the economists at the country's largest lender also called for some relief to the troubled NBFCs sector, which has been excluded from the three-month moratorium on loan repayments to financial institutions, and warned that if things deteriorate there will be an erosion of capital for such entities.Similarly, from a labour perspective, the dent is maximum in the hotels, trade, education, petroleum and agriculture sectors, while self-employment accounts for 30 per cent of the GDP, it said.&quot;A fiscal package is imperative now,&quot; it reminded the policymakers. In what can be said as a brighter side, the economists estimated credit offtake has increased in the final fortnight of March across various verticals, despite the COVID-19 scares, which illustrates confidence within businesses of a surge in demand post- lockdown.They estimated the incremental credit offtake at Rs 2.10 lakh crore in March, of which agriculture will be Rs 10,000 crore, industry Rs 1.20 lakh crore, services Rs 60,000 crore and personal loans Rs 20,000 crore.The note welcomed talk of a staggered pullout from the lockdown and pitched for top preference to be given to agriculture and procurement, followed by inland transport (both roads and railways), a trading activity that supports over 25 crore households, hotel services and limited construction activity to be allowed in the unaffected areas.From a demographic perspective, they said the population should be divided into the hospitalised, immunity compromised, and healthy individuals and we should have a well-defined strategy for each group as there is no herd immunity in the population for COVID-19.

 170 stocks gained and 184 lost on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE), on which the VN-Index is based. Total trading volume plunged 20 percent over the previous session to VND3.77 trillion ($160.6 million), with order-matched transactions accounting for 75 percent.
 The VN30 index for HoSE’s 30 biggest market caps slipped 0.35 percent this session, with 12 stocks gaining and 16 losing.
 The loss-makers were led by VIC of private conglomerate Vingroup, the market’s largest capped stock, which fell 3.4 percent this session. The ticker accounted for a 2.59-point decrease in the VN-Index, according to data from brokerage firm VNDIRECT.
 All but two tickers in the banking sector were in the red this session. Mid- sized banks were at the deeper end of the losing pool, with VPB of private VPBank, EIB of private Eximbank and MBB of state-owned Military Bank dropping 2.8 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.6 percent respectively.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a second night in intensive care and was in a stable condition on Wednesday after receiving oxygen support for COVID-19 complications while his foreign minister directs the battle against the outbreak.
 Johnson, who tested positive nearly two weeks ago, was taken to St Thomas' hospital on Sunday evening as he had a persistent high temperature and cough but his condition deteriorated on Monday and he was rushed into an intensive care unit.
 The 55-year-old British leader received oxygen support but was not put on a ventilator and his designated deputy, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, said he would soon be back at the helm as the world faces its gravest public health crisis in a century.
 "He is comfortable, he's stable, he's in good spirits," Edward Argar, a junior health minister, said on Wednesday. "While he's had oxygen, he hasn't been on a ventilator.
 As Johnson battled the novel coronavirus in hospital, the United Kingdom was entering what scientists said was the deadliest phase of the outbreak and grappling with the question of when to lift the lockdown.
 Inside the government, ministers were debating how long the world's fifth- largest economy could afford to be shut down, and the long-term implications of one of the most stringent set of emergency controls in peacetime history.
 The United Kingdom's total hospital deaths from COVID-19 rose by a record 786 to 6,159 as of 1600 GMT on April 6, the latest publicly available death toll, though just 213,181 people out of the population of around 68 million have been tested.
 Britain was in no position to lift the shutdown as the peak of the outbreak was still over a week away, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said.
 "We are nowhere near lifting the lockdown," Khan said.
 ACTING PM RAAB?
 Johnson was breathing without any assistance and had not required respiratory support, said Raab, who insisted that Johnson remained the boss.
 There are few precedents in British history of a prime minister being incapacitated at a time of major crisis, though Winston Churchill suffered a stroke while in office in 1953 and Tony Blair twice underwent heart treatment in the 2000s.
 Johnson has delegated some authority to Raab, who was appointed foreign minister less than a year ago, though any major decisions - such as when to lift the lockdown - would in effect need the blessing of Johnson's cabinet.
 "He's a fighter, and he'll be back at the helm leading us through this crisis in short order," Raab said on Tuesday. "His team will not blink, and we will not flinch from the task at hand at this crucial moment."
 Britain's uncodified constitution - an unwieldy collection of sometimes ancient and contradictory precedents - offers no clear, formal "Plan B." In essence, it is the prime minister's call and, if he is incapacitated, then up to cabinet to decide.
 Finance minister Rishi Sunak, a 39-year old former Goldman Sachs banker, would deputize should Raab become incapacitated.

The family of 97-year-old Holocaust survivor Shimon Reinzilber, who died because of COVID-19 after contracting the virus at the Mishan senior living facility in Beersheba, raged against what they see as profound neglect of the elderly by the facility, _Maariv_ reported on Wednesday.  

 Reinzilber died at Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba on Wednesday morning. At the time of writing, 10 Mishan residents died from the virus.  

 "He died alone, with no one by his side," his grandson Oren told the paper, "my grandfather was a Holocaust survivor from Poland and he was among the first 17 families who arrived to Beersheba in 1949. He came on the ship _Hatikva_ (the hope)."  

 He said that for a month, family members were not allowed to meet him at Mishan and that his grandfather was asked to move back and forth between Mishan, where he lived, and Soroka Medical Center for tests.
 "He returned to Mishan after he got a negative result," Oren said. "That was the biggest mistake of our lives."  

 He claimed that the foreign worker provided by the family to assist his grandfather attempted to get him help and was ignored by Mishan, who only agreed to release him to an apartment Oren rented for him in Beersheba.  

 Even then, Oren explained, they checked his grandfather for the virus but not the worker who was with him 24 hours a day.  

 Reinzilber was taken to the hospital from the apartment and died there, three months after the death of his wife.  

 "He said he would only live for three months without her," his grandson said. "He also asked not to sit shiva for him because he didn't want to bother anyone."  

 While he said that coronavirus was "the bullet that killed my grandfather," he added that "Mishan pressed the trigger, they killed eight more before him and will kill more after him. It is a state-backed concentration camp."  

 Mishan declined to respond to the report, saying that when a family is grieving they don't wish to add to their suffering and added that perhaps the grandson is "unaware of all the facts."
 The Association for Elderly People's Homes is currently seeking the help of the Supreme Court against the Health Ministry for what they claim is a refusal by the ministry to test elderly people and workers for the coronavirus, a lack of medical gear and a lack of disinfectant. According to the association, hospitals are first in line for all these things while they are expected to pay for them out of pocket.

Spain's overnight death toll from the coronavirus edged higher again on Wednesday while the main business lobby warned the economy could slump up to 9% this year if lockdown restrictions remain beyond May.
 The health ministry said 757 people died over the past 24 hours, up from 743 people the previous day, marking the second daily rise in a row and bringing the total death toll to 14,555 - the world's second-highest after Italy. However, Health Minister Salvador Illa said the numbers were still consistent with a slowdown. The daily percentage pace of increases has roughly halved from the end of March to about 5%.
 "There are no good numbers when it comes to deaths ... (but) we are now in the slowdown phase," he said. Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general said Spain's outbreak was "definitely slowing" but he cautioned against over-optimism.
 Overall, cases rose to 146,690 from 140,510 on Tuesday. At the Sur de Madrid cemetery, Reuters TV footage showed local priest Eduard Batubenga giving a short funeral prayer next to a hearse carrying the body of an elderly woman who died at a nursing home from the COVID-19 disease.
 Shortly after, a 37-year-old victim was buried. "Now, sometimes at a set time you get two services. While you are doing one, the other is waiting in line," Batubenga said, explaining that daily funerals had shot up to around 40 from 10-15 "on a bad day" before the epidemic.
 The surging death toll is forcing families to wait up to a week to bury loved ones, and only a maximum of three relatives can attend the burial. RECESSION COMING
 In a report, the CEOE business association expected the economy to shrink between 5% and 9% this year, sending up to 800,000 people into unemployment, depending on when the restrictions are going to be lifted. It called on the government to declare a tax moratorium for companies to prevent further damage and allow a speedy recovery, saying that under its most optimistic forecast the economy would rebound 5.2% next year.
 The government has so far only said that it expects the virus to bring a recession, without more precise forecasts. After the European Union failed to agree on more support for their reeling economies, Spanish officials warned the bloc's future was in jeopardy if it cannot come up with a joint financial response to combat the new coronavirus

Stamattina all'arrivo del primo mezzo Caremar partito da Napoli alle ore 7,15 ad attendere sul porto i trasportatori hanno trovato il sindaco di Capri Marino Lembo in persona insieme al responsabile della protezione civile del comune di Capri, al presidente della Capri Servizi e le forze dell'ordine per controllare le autocertificazioni in possesso, l'applicazione delle norme sulle tute di protezione dei trasportatori e la tracciabilità delle merci per accertare destinazione e provenienza. Un'attività durata oltre un'ora ed è stato comunicato a tutti i trasportatori che oltre alla mascherina sul viso da domani il personale addetto dovrà indossare la necessaria tuta bianca. Oltre ai controlli sono stati sanificati da parte del personale della Capri Servizi tutti i veicoli sul porto prima di intraprendere il percorso lungo le strade carrozzabili dell'isola. "Un'attività - ha detto il sindaco di Capri - che proseguirà sino al 14 aprile per evitare che sull'isola sbarchino oltre i furbetti delle vacanze anche veicoli non finalizzati allo sbarco di merci e al trasporto di fabbisogno per l'isola e ad altre attività consentite da ordinanze regionali e municipali".
