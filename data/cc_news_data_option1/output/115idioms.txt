He said his experience in business and in entertainment is that politicians are increasingly out of touch, and the Conservatives need to think hard about opting for an insider-type leader once again.

TORONTO (AP) - Canadians are struggling to come to terms with how the killing of an Iranian general last week in a U.S. drone stroke may have led to the deaths of dozens of their citizens in a plane crash.The Ukrainian International Airlines jet that crashed just after taking off from Tehran’s main airport Wednesday was carrying 176 people, including 138 passengers on their way to Canada and at least 63 Canadians. All were killed.By late Thursday, Western leaders said Iran had most likely shot down the plane with a missile amid the tension. They said it was probably an accident.Iran is denying a missile hit a Ukrainian airplane that crashed near Tehran this week and is calling on the U.S. and Canada to release data backing their allegations.Several world leaders say they believe a Ukrainian commercial flight was shot down by Iran.Western leaders say the plane appeared to have been unintentionally hit by an Iranian missile, just hours after Iran launched a series of ballistic missiles on two American bases in Iraq, in retaliation for the killing of its top general in a U.S. airstrike.If the U.S. and Canada provide proof that a missile downed the Ukrainian plane, it could inflame public opinion in Iran after many rallied around authorities following the U.S. strike that killed Iran’s top general last week.The Western allegation that Iran shot down a Ukrainian jetliner and offers a grim echo for the Islamic Republic, which found itself the victim of an accidental shootdown by American forces over 30 years ago. The July 3, 1988 downing of Iran Air flight 655 by the U.S. Navy remains one of the moments the Iranian government points to in its decades-long distrust of America. They rank it alongside the 1953 CIA-backed coup that toppled its elected prime minister and secured Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s absolute power until he abdicated the throne before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Ace Indian shuttlers PV Sindhu and Saina Nehwal suffered a major blow as they knocked out of the ongoing Malaysia Masters 2020 after slumping to defeats in their respective quarter-final clashes of the women s singles event of the tournament on Friday.  The Rio Olympic silver-medallist failed to continue her good form in the tournament so far and went down fighting 16-21,16-21 against top-seed TAI Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei in a one-sided last-eight clash that lasted just 36 minutes.  Earlier, Sindhu eased past Aya Ohori of Japan 21-10, 21-15 in the second round of the tournament to book her spot in the quarter-final of the tournament.  Besides Sindhu, London Olympic bronze-medallist Saina Nehwal also bowed out of the Malaysia Masters after suffering a crushing 8-21, 7-21 defeat at the hands of Carolina Marin of Spain in another last-eight clash that lasted just half an hour.  On Thursday, Nehwal had swept aside eighth-seeded An Se Young of Korea 25-23, 21-12 in the second round of the women s singles event.  Top-seed TAI Tzu Ying will now take on seventh-seeded He Bing Jiao of Japan, while Marin will next lock horns with the winner of another quarter-final clash between China s Wang Zhi Yi and Chen Yu Fei for a place in the semi-final of the tournament.

Given these elements, a lot of literary specialists have wanted to qualify Joseph Conrad as a Polish writer. But Conrad wrote in English, and left Poland when he was a mere teenager: does a writer always need to stand up for his country? Does a writing have to be attached to a territory, a physical place?

Trump also sought to compare his response to the recent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to the 2012 attack on U.S. government facility in Benghazi. A U.S. ambassador to Libya, a foreign service officer and two CIA contractors were killed in the Benghazi attack, which led to a two-year Republican-led investigation into then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was not found to have committed wrongdoing.

RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - About a third of auto loans for new vehicles taken in the first half of 2019 had terms of longer than six years. That’s according to credit –reporting firm Experian. The average size of an auto loan for a new car is now $32,119. Which means- more and more Americans are taking longer to pay off a vehicle.You may be getting smaller monthly payments, but in reality, depending on the terms, you are paying way more than the value of that vehicle. Cherry Dale with the Virginia Credit Union says-- don’t just look at your potential monthly payment when buying-- so you need to know the overall cost of the loan.“If you’re able I would encourage people to finance for a shorter amount of time and yeah. Your monthly payments might be larger at the end of the day they’re going to pay less for the overall cost of the car,” said Dale.And think about this before you sign a 6 or more year car loan, remember, the tendency for a car to break down after 7 years goes way up. Or perhaps take a step back and not get a new car but a slightly used one. so your not trying to finance 32,000.Copyright 2020 WWBT.

Before Chris Leonard takes the court with his Marshall Mavericks for today’s game, he’ll likely try to shut himself off from the outside world to focus in on what he needs to do to help his team come away with another win.
 “I just shut all social media and I put on a couple songs and I get in my zone,” Leonard explained. “I go for a little rap and I go for a little country.”
 The senior guard has high expectations for his final year of high school basketball.
 “For us to become more of a team and to go all the way to the state championship, that’s our main goal,” he said when asked what he hopes to accomplish this season. “Just bonding off the court is the main thing.”
 Leonard added, “I’m more aggressive. My confidence is sky high.”
 “He’s a really good on-ball defender,” Marshall head boys basketball coach Bobby Carson said of Leonard. “He’s really, really quick. He plays hard all the time. He’s turned into our most consistent outside shooter. He’s a good ball handler. He’s a really good player. He has a good attitude. He doesn’t say much but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. He’s played a lot of basketball so he’s pretty savvy. He works hard. He passes his classes and he doesn’t get into trouble. Mom and dad are real supportive. They come to every ballgame. That’s been a huge plus.”
 Leonard said the energy that the fans bring helps fuel the Mavericks.
 “It’s great,” he said. “I like how they give us energy when we’re on the court and I just feed of their vibe. It helps us even more when we’re on the court.”
 “I can swing him back and forth,” Carson continued. “I guess the best way to describe it is he’s a combo guard. He’s a combination point-guard-two-guard. He can penetrate, handle the ball and shoot the three. It’s nice to have him, Jayson Tuck and Lyrik Rawls. They’re all so versatile and can play more than one position on the perimeter. Sometimes I have all three of them out there. All three of them have played point guard. All three of them can shoot the three and all three of them can get to the basket. That’s a nice option to have. If you’re lucky, you have just one point guard but we’ve got three who can do it.”
 Last year saw the Mavericks miss the postseason for the first time in 10 years. Leonard is determined to make sure to help lead his Mavericks back to the playoffs in 2020.
 “It just adds motivation for everybody,” Leonard said. “This is a revenge year for us. We just want to get our wins back and get back to the playoffs.”
 The Mavericks currently hold an overall record of 18-6 and a district record of 2-0. They are slated to return to action today when they play host to the Pine Tree Pirates. Tipoff for the game has been moved up to 4:30 p.m. at the high school due to severe weather in the forecast.

Pete Buttigieg touched off a storm of criticism on Twitter Thursday when he mentioned civilians killed in a passenger aircraft shot down by the Iranian army died due to a army “tit for tat” between the US and Iran.

TORONTO (AP) - Canadians are struggling to come to terms with how the killing of an Iranian general last week in a U.S. drone stroke may have led to the deaths of dozens of their citizens in a plane crash.The Ukrainian International Airlines jet that crashed just after taking off from Tehran’s main airport Wednesday was carrying 176 people, including 138 passengers on their way to Canada and at least 63 Canadians. All were killed.By late Thursday, Western leaders said Iran had most likely shot down the plane with a missile amid the tension. They said it was probably an accident.Iran is denying a missile hit a Ukrainian airplane that crashed near Tehran this week and is calling on the U.S. and Canada to release data backing their allegations.Several world leaders say they believe a Ukrainian commercial flight was shot down by Iran.Western leaders say the plane appeared to have been unintentionally hit by an Iranian missile, just hours after Iran launched a series of ballistic missiles on two American bases in Iraq, in retaliation for the killing of its top general in a U.S. airstrike.If the U.S. and Canada provide proof that a missile downed the Ukrainian plane, it could inflame public opinion in Iran after many rallied around authorities following the U.S. strike that killed Iran’s top general last week.The Western allegation that Iran shot down a Ukrainian jetliner and offers a grim echo for the Islamic Republic, which found itself the victim of an accidental shootdown by American forces over 30 years ago. The July 3, 1988 downing of Iran Air flight 655 by the U.S. Navy remains one of the moments the Iranian government points to in its decades-long distrust of America. They rank it alongside the 1953 CIA-backed coup that toppled its elected prime minister and secured Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s absolute power until he abdicated the throne before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

One of these artists will also make a guest appearance for a party in the villa.

I would urge people to really take on board the dangers around farming whenever working with livestock, slurry or machinery. Farmers think it’ll never happen to them but sadly as we have seen, all it takes is a few seconds for a serious injury or death to occur,” she said.

TORONTO (AP) - Canadians are struggling to come to terms with how the killing of an Iranian general last week in a U.S. drone stroke may have led to the deaths of dozens of their citizens in a plane crash.The Ukrainian International Airlines jet that crashed just after taking off from Tehran’s main airport Wednesday was carrying 176 people, including 138 passengers on their way to Canada and at least 63 Canadians. All were killed.By late Thursday, Western leaders said Iran had most likely shot down the plane with a missile amid the tension. They said it was probably an accident.Iran is denying a missile hit a Ukrainian airplane that crashed near Tehran this week and is calling on the U.S. and Canada to release data backing their allegations.Several world leaders say they believe a Ukrainian commercial flight was shot down by Iran.Western leaders say the plane appeared to have been unintentionally hit by an Iranian missile, just hours after Iran launched a series of ballistic missiles on two American bases in Iraq, in retaliation for the killing of its top general in a U.S. airstrike.If the U.S. and Canada provide proof that a missile downed the Ukrainian plane, it could inflame public opinion in Iran after many rallied around authorities following the U.S. strike that killed Iran’s top general last week.The Western allegation that Iran shot down a Ukrainian jetliner and offers a grim echo for the Islamic Republic, which found itself the victim of an accidental shootdown by American forces over 30 years ago. The July 3, 1988 downing of Iran Air flight 655 by the U.S. Navy remains one of the moments the Iranian government points to in its decades-long distrust of America. They rank it alongside the 1953 CIA-backed coup that toppled its elected prime minister and secured Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s absolute power until he abdicated the throne before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Trump also turned to a topic that frequently rankles him: the fact that he has never won a Nobel Prize. Referencing the 2019 Nobel Prize winner, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Trump said that he himself deserved the honor instead.

Christie wasn’t charged and denied knowing about the plan ahead of time or as it was unfolding. Several witnesses at the trial, including Kelly and Baroni, contradicted his account.

_Milano, 10 gen 12:49 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- "La campagna di disinformazione circa il rinnovo del contratto con Trenord, deciso da Regione Lombardia, sta raggiungendo livelli assolutamente imbarazzanti". Questo il commento del vice capogruppo della Lega e vice Presidente della Commissione Trasporti del Pirellone Andrea Monti. "A questo punto – prosegue Andrea Monti – è opportuno mettere qualche punto fermo sulla questione e chiarire una volta per tutte come stanno le cose. Anzitutto è bene precisare come la Toscana, presa ad esempio da alcuni media, abbia messo a gara solo il servizio di trasporto su gomma, non quello relativo ai treni, che invece è stato confermato con affidamento diretto a Trenitalia. E qui è necessaria un'ulteriore specifica. L'azienda di Stato, proprio in Toscana, ha investito la bellezza di 1,4 miliardi di euro per l'acquisto di 100 nuovi treni. Il ché, per gli abitanti di quel territorio, costituisce certamente una bella notizia, se non fosse che in Lombardia, la stessa Trenitalia, socia al 50 per cento di Trenord, non ha investito un solo euro. È spettato alla Regione infatti, mettere una pezza, tirando fuori di tasca propria 1,6 miliardi di risorse per rinnovare il parco mezzi". (segue) (Com)

A storm forecast to bring snow and ice to a large portion of the northern U.S. will likely bring rain to central Pennsylvania.
 The storm, according to AccuWeather, will feature record-challenging warmth that will accompany the rain. The storm will channel warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, which will help fuel the rain on the southern end of the storm.
 The high in Harrisburg will be in the mid-40s on Friday before flirting with 60 on Saturday and Sunday.
 The rain is forecast to begin late Friday night and persist through Saturday night. National Weather Service notes that a rumble of thunder also isn’t out of the question.

A bartender stops to dance with a raver before walking back with a tray, balancing drinks with one hand.

"Gang war is quite common during college life. I used to stay at a girls' hostel alongside a boys' hostel, where people were followed and murdered in broad daylight. A boy once jumped into our hostel and was about to get killed by a mob, but our hostel manager saved him," she said.
