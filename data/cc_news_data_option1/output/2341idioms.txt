Alaya F made her debut with Jawaani Jaaneman and has ever since been winning a lot of hearts. For her promotional wardrobe, she opted for the most stylish and unique outfits that left the fashion police stunned. Actors always go overboard with the looks they pull off for the promotions of their movies, but Alaya stayed true to her style and also dressed her age, which we loved. Subtle colours, minimal make-up, casual and comfortable clothes, simple accessories and trendy shoes are what Alaya’s fashion game is all about.

I wouldn’t subscribe to that argument. They said Zik was ill, he was going for treatment and then he left the country and at the time of the coup, he wasn’t there, whether he got wind or he didn’t get wind of it, I would not know. Those who planned the coup must have taken a decision but it does appear that it was not in totality deliberate. I give you a specific example, the signal commencing the action in Enugu was delivered that morning and it did say: “Arrest, secure the key points and wait for further instructions”. And if you are in doubt, that was why Fani Kayode was arrested in Ibadan and brought down to Lagos, they wanted to kill him but what stopped them from killing him in his house in Ibadan was because of the instructions (waiting for further instructions) and he was brought down to Lagos.

“It’s been really busy,” Thornton said. “I think it helps that our community is so small. We have a lot of members in our community wanting to help, so they’re coming in quite often to support. I think if we were in Olympia or something it might be a little different story.”
 The cafe serves breakfast and lunch only, with breakfast being by far its most popular. Everything is made from scratch, like the gravy on the homemade biscuits that runs for $6.50. The cafe even bakes its own bread for biscuits, sandwiches and toast. Mama’s toast, which is a choice of bread with melted butter, a slice of tomato and pepper, is also among the most popular on the menu and goes for $4.25.
 Although business has been good for Lemon Tree through community support, it’s also been bolstered by the cafe’s willingness to adjust. Burgers are now being offered daily instead of just being a weekly special. The cafe buys its meat locally from the Bear Ridge Smokehouse in Morton.
 “We’re trying to keep people in,” Thornton said. “We sell a lot of burgers.”
 There is no dinner menu but some customers order lunch items, such as the burgers, for dinner. Some other local favorites on the lunch side include smothered roast beef and grilled guacamole turkey sandwiches.
 “Those ones I’m proud of because I made those up,” Thornton said. “We have secret sauces we put on there that are homemade in-house.”
 The cafe has a little bit of everything, offering a full espresso bar with Dillanos Coffee Roasters coffee, which is roasted in Sumner, Washington. It also offers milkshakes, along with an assortment of baked goods, such as pies, cakes and cupcakes, all of which are made from scratch.
 Another plus for the cafe during these times is having a drive-through window, which also helped boost business the past three months. It’s one of few restaurants in east Lewis County that offers a drive through, Thornton said.
 “People really like that,” Thornton said. “It’s so convenient, with or without COVID-19. You can call in your order and don’t even have to get out of your car.”
 The dining room did open when Lewis County moved into phase 2 of Gov. Jay Inslee’s four-phase “Safe Start” reopening plan over Memorial Day Weekend. The cafe is currently operating at 50 percent or less capacity, with regards to the guidelines, which is 24 seats for Lemon Tree.
 The first week was pretty slow with customers coming in to actually sit down and eat, but it is gradually picking up every day now. Thornton said people are starting to be more comfortable with dining-in at restaurants.
 Lemon Tree Cafe and Espresso is currently open 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., Saturday and Sunday. A full menu and prices can be found on its Facebook page.

China admite que vuelve a estar "en guerra" contra el Covid-19 cuando todo hacía pensar que estaba a punto de superarlo. El origen de este brote no está del todo claro, aunque se sospecha que el virus estaba en una tabla de cortar pescado en un mercado, de Pekín. Nuevos casos confirmados Las autoridades sanitarias han informado de 27 nuevos casos confirmados en la ciudad de Pekín , que está realizando pruebas de ácido nucleico a todo aquel que haya tenido contacto con casos confirmados o que hayan visitado el mercado de alimentos frescos de Xinfadi, el principal de la ciudad, cerrado desde el sábado. La capacidad de propagación, mucho más alta que en Wuhan Las autoridades reconocen que la capacidad de propagación es muy alta, más que en Wuhan, y ya están tomando medidas. Han confinado a 90.000 ciudadanos en una veintena de barrios, han prohibido a los taxis salir de la ciudad y más 100.000 funcionarios se han puesto a trabajar para vigilar el rebrote. Se sospecha que el brote surgió en un local de despiece de salmón del mayor mercado de abastos de la ciudad , y se han tomado muestras en todos los puestos del mercado. El temor se palpa en las calles porque, aunque muchos quieren creer en que sea una falsa alarma, nadie olvida que fue en otro mercado, el de Wuhan, donde comenzó esta pandemia.

A top Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official told ‘The News’ on Monday that the Board is keeping an eye on the rapidly changing Covid-19 situation in Lahore following announcement by the provincial government that it was enforcing lockdown in various parts of the city.
 With its own headquarters in Lahore, the PCB had planned to gather the 29-man squad selected for the tour of England in the city later this month but that plan could be changed.
 That’s because in recent days there had been an overwhelming increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the city, forcing the authorities to seal various localities there. There are now fears that the entire city could be placed under a strict lockdown in the near future in a bid to curb the spread of the infection.
 “This is a big cause of concern for us,” said a top PCB official. “We will have to rethink our plans as a lockdown (in Lahore) can affect the departure of the national team to England,” he added.
 The Board is concerned because a lockdown might also mean that no flights would be allowed to fly in or out of Lahore. Keeping such a scenario in mind, PCB is mulling the option to gather the England-bound squad in Islamabad ahead of their departure to England.
 According to plans, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will send a chartered flight to Pakistan which will take the national team to England. The decision is part of creating a completely bio-secure environment for the players and officials before and during the upcoming series.
 Meanwhile, top PCB officials had a telephonic discussion with their ECB counterparts on Monday to discuss the forthcoming Test and Twenty20 International series between the two teams.
 According to the PCB official, the interaction went well with discussions on several key issues including Pakistan’s departure plans, their training schedules and itinerary of the Test and T20I series.
 The Pakistanis want to send the squad to England on June 30 more than a month before the opening Test of the series will tentatively begin at Old Trafford in Manchester on July 5.
 “We want our team to reach England well ahead of the series to that the players have ample time to prepare for it,” the official said. Pakistan’s players have been out of action since March when he country went into lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 After the opening Test, the two teams will move to Southampton which will host back-to-back Tests. The tour will conclude with a three-match T20I series which will completely take place at Old Trafford. All six matches of the series will be played behind closed doors in bio-secure environment. The last T20I is expected to be played on September 1.
 Pakistan were planning to making Birmingham their training base during July but it is now more likely that they will instead train in Derby ahead of the three Tests.
 “ECB has told us that Derby is perhaps the best option as our training base in England,” the official said. “It has a hotel close to the ground. The venue has very good training facilities including indoor nets. So I think once it arrives in England, our team will proceed to Derby for its pre-series training camp.”
 The official said that PCB and ECB are expected to finalise the tour schedule within the next few days. “We will announce the itinerary as soon as it confirmed,” he said.

 A decision not to shift the market for the time being was taken after Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy held a meeting with traders association on Monday night.
 “Instead of shifting, some of the wholesale and retail vendors will be shifted to the opposite side of Goubert and will be accommodated in the old jail complex. This will considerably de-congest the market and allow physical distancing norms to be followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Mr. Arun said. The new arrangement would be reviewed in case vendors and customers were not following hygiene and physical distancing norms, he added.

 “The tender was supposed to be opened only on June 1 but the complaint was filed on May 6 itself. At that stage, the petitioner could not allege corruption. Further, it was an e-tender and anyone could participate in it from the comfort of their homes without being bothered about the lockdown to fight COVID-19,” he told the court.
 However, since senior counsel R. Shanmugusundaram, representing the petitioner, sought time to get instructions as to whether his client had received the DVAC’s closure report, the judge adjourned the case to Thursday. Thereafter, he took up the second plea by the same petitioner seeking registration of a FIR regarding the fiber optic cable tender.
 Senior counsel N.R. Elango argued that an FIR must be registered since the issue involved public money to the tune of ₹1,950 crore. Opposing the plea, Mr. Natarajan said this complaint too had been filed merely on the basis of petitioner’s assumptions even before opening of the tender documents and therefore the DVAC had chosen to close it.
 After hearing them, the judge directed the SPP to file a report listing out the factual matrix and adjourned the second petition too to Thursday.

But the IRS doesn't send armed agents to the homes of people who don't file tax returns. Building code violations aren't enforced by armed officers. Restaurant health inspectors don't carry guns. Neither do meter maids.
 "And yet for a broken tail light or your windows tinted too darkly we've decided the first enforcement step is going to be people with guns," said Rosa Brooks, a professor at Georgetown University Law School and the author of a forthcoming book on the future of policing. "To me, it's not fundamentally about let's cut budgets by X percent, it's more about let's really rethink which tasks require a bunch of people with guns to show up and which tasks do not require that."
 Tracey Brame, associate dean at Western Michigan University's Cooley Law School, said that after years of back and forth about over- and under- policing, the video of George Floyd's killing and the images of police in military gear seemingly at war with their communities have pushed the pendulum all the way to one side.
 "When I was a kid, my brother played football for the Police Athletic League," Brame said. "Now the conversation in the Black community has flipped. I'm having conversations with my son about how he should be cautious with police officers. I'm trying to walk this tight rope."
 Brame said she sees the defund police conversation more as "dismantle and rebuild."
 "You shake up the way that business is being done and you rebuild it in such a way that it has community buy-in and support," she said. "In such a way that police are seen as allies."
 That's essentially what happened in the most commonly cited example of American police reform, Camden, New Jersey. Camden dissolved its Police Department, but did not defund it.
 It reestablished its city Police Department as a county force, adopted new training methods and instituted new policies attempting to limit police use of force. It rehired many officers, circumventing the police union, and now has about twice as many officers as previously.
 Brooks, a former Washington, D.C., police officer, estimated that 90% of her calls didn't need an armed response -- the threat of force. They were minor disputes, or an injured person who needed a ride to the hospital or checking up on a stolen car.
 Similarly, about 90% of the crimes Seattle police have responded to this year have been nonviolent, according to department statistics.
 "If you do have a gun, there's a little bit more incentive to say 'I'm done arguing with you, I'm done reasoning with you, do what I say because I have the gun,' " Brooks said.
 That's the kind of thinking Sue Rahr tries to discourage.
 Rahr, a former King County sheriff and the executive director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission, oversees the training of every new law enforcement officer in the state.
 They're trying to train officers to deescalate situations. Buy time. Talk to people.
 "Traditional police training focused on get in as quickly as you can and assert control right away," Rahr said. "But if you have the opportunity to slow down the action and to create space and a place to shield yourself, you improve your chances of deescalating the situation."
 Still, Rahr thinks it's "unrealistic and inappropriate" to ask officers to respond to dangerous situations without firearms.
 "We are an extraordinarily armed nation," Rahr said. "I've talked to colleagues from the U.K., where a lot of their police officers don't carry firearms, but the majority of the public doesn't carry firearms either."
 Rahr's been focused on deescalation training, in some form, since 2013. That process accelerated with the 2018 passage of Initiative 940, which mandated mental health and deescalation training not just for new officers, but for veteran officers who may not have received it when they went through the academy decades ago.
 "The deescalation training, I believe, is producing recruits that are better at critically thinking and looking at the right potential threats," Rahr said. But she doesn't know for sure.
 The state currently has no way to reliably measure police use of force.
 "We have no system for data collection so that we can analyze and learn," Rahr said. "There's no way to measure whether that training is effective or not."

“Roundabouts are incredibly effective when it comes to helping reduce that potential for collisions for a number of reasons,” Adamson said. “When you have a vehicle that turns in front of an oncoming vehicle that’s doing 50 miles an hour, the results can be catastrophic.”
 He continued by pointing to WSDOT’s history of building roundabouts and the data compiled over that time that has supported the impact they can have.
 “We’re just really firm believers in roundabouts,” Adamson said. “Just because of the history that we have with them and they physically can change how people get through an intersection.”
 Thurston County Commissioner John Hutchings estimates the project has been in the works for roughly two and a half years. He says the project was of mutual interest to the county and the Chehalis Tribe.
 He said the county proposed the roundabout in an effort to reduce collisions and to get traffic in and out of the casino in a safe manner without having to block and seal off roads. It was a process of offers and counteroffers between the county and the Chehalis Tribe, as Hutchings put it.
 According to Hutchings, there were also interlocal agreements, discussions concerning funding, maintenance and indemnity clauses that had to be worked out between the county, the Chehalis Tribe and also the state.

The "unfairness" of a government scheme for the self-employed has left hundreds of workers across Suffolk out of pocket, an accountancy firm believes.Beatons Group said calculations used to work out pay-outs under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), which was designed to help self-employed people through the coronavirus crisis had left some "drastically" short.In theory, people working for themselves were entitled to claim a taxable grant of 80% of their average monthly profits of up to £7,500. MORE - Screens and visors set to make pubs look very different as they re-open to public But Stephanie Hammond, director of the Ipswich-based chartered accountants said many had been caught out by how the calculation is made. "The government averages three years of tax returns in order to calculate pay-outs for self-employed workers," she said. "For people who have become self- employed very recently, it can be extremely unfair using a very basic calculation. I fully appreciate that this has been done for speed and the ease of administration, but many people are receiving much lower amounts than they would have expected." Those applying SEISS were also not allowed to use an accountant to submit their application - unlike businesses wanting to furlough staff under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Beatons client Lee Riley, from Kesgrave, who has run his own decorator and handyman business for two and a half years, was among those to lose out. The 39-year-old would normally earn in excess of £2,000 a month before expenses, but received a SEISS payment of just £1,500 for a three-month period - an average of £500 a month. "I think my biggest grievance is that I abided by every government guideline when it came to COVID-19," he said. "Many of my customers are older people so I would never put them at risk. I contacted them all saying I was putting everything on hold and downed tools. "But now I feel like I've been kicked in the teeth. I don't want to appear ungrateful because I have received some money. However, it has literally only helped me for a month and that's because of how it's been calculated using my taxable profit. "I live on my own and my outgoings are around £1,300 per month. I have a 10-year-old daughter who lives with her mum to provide for, as well as the usual bills and rent." Mr Riley said he had been forced to use up his savings to stay afloat while his landlord has helped by putting a hold on his rent for three months. "Running a business, you try to have a pot of savings behind you. I had £2,800 and now have just £16 left. "I never expected the government to match my money pound for pound for what I could have earned during lockdown but £1,500 for three months is an awful lot less than I would have earned." SEISS, which was launched on May 13, has been extended for another three months which will allow workers to make a second claim in August for up to £6,570 - up to 70% of their average monthly trading profits.

Out in East Lewis County, Heather McKenzie adopted the drive-through signing events idea that Hamilton was employing and brought it to her neck of the woods in Packwood.
 McKenzie noted that while locals made up a good chunk of her signatures, she also capitalized on the visitors who were getting out of the city and heading toward East Lewis County to rent a cabin or stay at a summer home. McKenzie said people visiting from Tacoma to Bellingham were also signing her petitions too.
 But for McKenzie, simply handing out a blank petition and telling the person to ask family and friends to sign it proved to be the most effective way to gather signatures.
 “One person had 14 (signatures) on hers, another had five, another had seven, another person had filled it up and needed another,” McKenzie said. “So that multiplied it out really quickly.”
 At just one drive-through event McKenzie said she was able to hand out 50 blank petitions to people who said they would try and get family and friends on board.
 Because of this tactic, it made it hard to give an accurate estimate of how many signatures she was able to secure. But she was inclined to believe that the number had to be somewhere in the thousands.
 With the petitions turned in to the Secretary of State’s office and R-90 likely going to a vote, what is next for these advocates?
 Two things, says Hamilton. One would be to continue to educate voters on why they believe the comprehensive sex education law is a “really bad law.”
 Second, is to get more people registered to vote, an issue Hamilton came across while getting signatures for petitions.
 “It’s still surprising to me how many people I talk to that aren’t registered to vote,” Hamilton said.

Scientists have discovered antibodies in the blood of recovered Covid-19 patients that provide powerful protection against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease, when tested in animals and human cell cultures.
 Injections of such antibodies could, in principle, be given to patients in the early stage of Covid-19 to reduce the level of virus and protect against severe disease, according to the researchers from the Scripps Research Institute in the US.
 These antibodies may also be used to provide temporary, vaccine-like protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection for healthcare workers, elderly people, and others who respond poorly to traditional vaccines or are suspected of a recent exposure to the coronavirus, they said.
 The research, published on Monday in the journal Science, offers a paradigm of swift reaction to an emergent and deadly viral pandemic. It sets the stage for clinical trials and additional tests of the antibodies, which are now being produced as potential treatments and preventives for Covid-19, the researchers said.
 "The discovery of these very potent antibodies represents an extremely rapid response to a totally new pathogen," said Dennis Burton from the Scripps Research Institute. "It has been a tremendous collaborative effort, and we're now focused on making large quantities of these promising antibodies for clinical trials," said Thomas Rogers, an adjunct assistant professor at Scripps Research, and assistant professor of Medicine at University of California, San Diego.
 Developing a treatment or vaccine for severe Covid-19 is currently the world's top public health priority, the researchers said.One approach to new viral threats is to identify, in the blood of recovering patients, antibodies that neutralise the virus's ability to infect cells, they said.
 These antibodies, the researchers said, can then be mass-produced, using biotechnology methods, as a treatment that blocks severe disease and as a vaccine like preventive that circulates in the blood for several weeks to protect against infection.
 This approach already has been demonstrated successfully against Ebola virus and the pneumonia-causing respiratory syncytial virus, commonly known as RSV, they said.The researchers took blood samples from patients who had recovered from mild-to-severe Covid-19.
 They developed test cells that express ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to get into human cells.In a set of initial experiments, the team tested whether antibody-containing blood from the patients could bind to the virus and strongly block it from infecting the test cells.
 The scientists were able to isolate more than 1,000 distinct antibody- producing immune cells, called B cells, each of which produced a distinct anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody.The team obtained the antibody gene sequences from these B cells so that they could produce the antibodies in the laboratory.
 By screening these antibodies individually, the team identified several that, even in tiny quantities, could block the virus in test cells, and one that could also protect hamsters against heavy viral exposure.

Clearly, Big G needs to bring some serious audio improvements to the table and perhaps a facelift as well to keep up with the surprisingly powerful, relatively compact, and decidedly elegant 2019 Echo. Although 9To5Google's "sources familiar with the matter" can confirm such a product is indeed in the works, there are almost no details to share on either feature upgrades or possible design revisions.
   
 All we know is the second-gen Google Home will "look unassuming and familiar" while sounding better than its forerunner (well, duh). Naturally, we don't expect this thing to match the audio capabilities of the high-end Google Home Max, but unfortunately, current speculation calls for a higher price point than that of the original Google Home.
   
 Available back in the day for $129, the search giant's direct rival to Amazon's $100 Echo received many discounts over its lifetime, including a permanent one to $99 and a recent clearance cut to 30 bucks. By the way, in case you're wondering, that dirt-cheap ship appears to have sailed, and the OG smart speaker is probably gone for good.
   
 Purportedly codenamed Prince, the second-gen Google Home is unlikely to be called the Google Home 2, although it remains unclear how the Nest brand will be incorporated. Our money is on a Nest Home moniker, but if you consider the Nest Mini and Nest Hub names, a simple Nest label would make more sense. Maybe a Nest (2nd gen) to correspond to the somewhat confusing Nest Mini (2nd gen) name of the Google Home Mini sequel.
   
 Meanwhile, your guess is as good as ours in terms of a release schedule, as Google is unlikely to unveil the smart speaker alone but no one knows when the Pixel 4a handset is supposed to see daylight anymore.

Anger, mostly, at the destruction of a tribute to a man who, although imperfect, devoted his life to the city of his birth. A man who integrated the police force. Who was beloved of many in the black communities he helped keep safe from the drug scourge. A man who made enemies, and friends who’d take a bullet for him.
 The anger was accompanied by bemusement at the foolishness of the act, one that was as unnecessary as it was futile. Erasing Rizzo’s face, or tearing down his massive metal effigy, will not remove him from our collective institutional memory.
