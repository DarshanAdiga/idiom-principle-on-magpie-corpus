 After finishing his second season with the Metro Jets in 2019-20, the 2000-born forward from Lake Orion had options for the 2020-21 season, but only one checked all the boxes.
 “I was in between going to school for this year and coming back all summer but when it came down to it, I knew that coming back another year, getting better, and a chance for an offer to attend a school and play college hockey was what I needed,” Graham said. “I think the coaching and everyone that helps with the organization is what makes it so prestigious. The setup and all the time we are capable of putting in on and off the ice as well as the work the coaches put in to get our names out there, talking to schools, and helping us get better along the way, this organization does it all.”

In its blog post, "No Rest for the Wicked: Evilnum Unleashes PyVil RAT," Cybereason points to Evilnum as an operation whose malware attacks and phishing campaigns are highly targeted. The group typically sets its sights on financial technology (FinTech) companies, and mostly those located in the UK and EU.
 To deploy its malware, Evilnum exploits documents for Know Your Customer regulations (KYC), which contain information provided by clients conducting business with various providers. Such documents are often used by banks and financial companies to verify the identity of their clients, which seems to tie in with Evilnum's focus on the FinTech sector.

Self-improvement has been a popular pursuit during the lockdown (as was baking, which, as anyone good at it will vouch, is really a process of self-improvement). People tried to sleep better, eat better, exercise better -- getting themselves to acquire new (and good) habits. That's easier said than done. The unfortunate thing about habits is that it isn't about memory or willpower. That's what most people think they are about -- and most people are wrong. A good habit , say behaviourists, is to set oneself up for success by adopting a strategy that is about neither memory nor will. Behavioural scientist BJ Fogg, who's been studying habit formation for over two decades, says people tend to miscast habits as big goals. Instead, he argues, it's small changes that change behaviour. This counter-intuitive idea forms the basis of his book, Tiny Habits (2019).The trick, according to him, is to reimagine the habit. Not as a virtue (as some tend to do). Nor about it being good for the body or the mind. But simply as a pattern of the everyday. A good way to do this is to find a slot for the new habit, ideally piggybacking on an existing one -- for instance, stretches soon after a bath; vitamins before watering the plant. There is a difference, of course. Many habits that people have are essential ones. Science says most species form habits as part of an ancient evolutionary response. The habits people want to form, though, the new ones, offer more cumulative, abstract or long-term results . The idea is to trick the mind into believing that the habit is a mundane and necessary one -- so that no conscious decision needs to be made about it. There is a a myth that it takes 21 days to build a healthy new habit. In truth, it's a lot more complex than that. Research shows that it can take between 18 and 254 days for a behaviour to become second nature. "You can't put all behaviours and habits in one category," says Dr Samir Parikh, director of the department of mental health and behavioural sciences at Fortis Healthcare, Delhi. "The best way to go about it really is to tack it on to an existing everyday task." People try to make it about reward instead -- a snack with your vitamins, or after your run. "But the danger there," Dr Parikh adds, "is that you're really trying to form two new habits; neither might take; and if the feedback mechanism gets diluted, then the habit is gone."

PORTSMOUTH -- The Escobar Farm Corn Maze is back for its 21st year with a nod to local farmers, who have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "Farmers work seven days a week, 365 days a year, so this is a little shout out to farmers during COVID," said Stuart MacNaught, who helps oversee corn maze operations. "Everyone loved [this year's theme]. It's so upbeat."
   
 The eight-acre maze off Middle Road, which opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday with owner Louis Escobar and wife Jane, depicts a farmer on a tractor with the words: "On the 8th day, God made a farmer." It was designed by Brett Herbst of the Utah-based company The Maize.
   
 Escobar said the status of this year's maze was uncertain for a time because of the pandemic, but it was given the OK by state agencies. He is expecting a strong year, considering the push to keep people outside.
   
 "We're a real outdoor activity," he said.
   
 This year's maze is certainly different. Hand sanitizer is readily available and signage is posted reminding visitors to stay 6 feet apart. Masks are required.
   
 "We're going to make it as close to what we've had, and one of the challenges is the spacing," Escobar said. "We're not going to allow 30 people to go, but when they get in the maze, they might be getting lost. There might be less than the 6 feet."
   
 "Corn Cops" are stationed throughout the maze to direct people and help maintain the social distancing.
   
 "We'll probably make a couple of adjustments over the first week or so, then I expect it to run smoothly," Escobar said.
   
 For the time being, reservations are not required. "We looked at everything, and we decided [not to require reservations] because people could cancel or not show up," MacNaught said.
   
 Tickets can be purchased ahead of time -- there's a $1 discount for those who purchase online, MacNaught said -- on the farm's newly revamped website at escobarfarm.com. Those who do not purchase tickets in advance can only pay in cash.
   
 Admission is $10 for ages 12 and older and $8 for youths ages 5 to 11. Children 4 years old and younger receive free admission. The maze is open Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. until dusk, with the last entry being one hour before dark. It is also open on Labor Day and Columbus Day.
   
 Dogs are permitted, but they must be on a leash at all times.

A Rochester Hills man with a history of driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics overdosed while driving and crashed into two vehicles Wednesday morning, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office said.
 It was shortly before 11 a.m. when deputies responded to the area of Crooks Road and Hamlin Avenue where they found the driver, 52, unresponsive. He was removed from his vehicle and CPR was started, and then deputies determined he had overdosed. Narcan was administered twice and he was subsequently transported to an area hospital by a crew from the Rochester Hills Fire Department, the sheriff’s office said.
 The drivers of the two vehicles the man had crashed into sustained minor injuries and were treated at the scene, the sheriff’s office said. Both are Rochester Hills residents.

Jets coach-GM Justin Quenneville loves the skill set Graham brings to the rink each day and feels he is a college hockey player in the making.
 “’Grahamer’ is an elite player with high-end hockey IQ,” Quenneville said. “We have already had multiple NCAA schools ask about him before the season has even started. He will be highly recruited this year, no doubt. What makes him so valuable is his versatility as a player. He gets the game and makes necessary adjustments all over the ice. Not only does he make great plays offensively, he takes important faceoffs for us, can QB the power play for us up top or on the half wall and a big reason why players always want to play with him.
 “We are excited to help him this year and he will be a valuable piece to our program again this year."
 Going into the upcoming season, Graham realizes that how last season ended with the COVID-19 outbreak left him “very unsatisfied.”
 “It was sad working hard all year for nationals just for it to end after the first game,” Graham said. “Hoping to have that opportunity again and win it. The rest of this summer, I’m going to continue to work out off the ice, finish working my job, and then get on ice and start skating.”

MIDDLETOWN -- Long before George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two Black men, were fatally shot by officers on back-to-back days in June 2016. Their deaths set off a firestorm of protests around the country.
   
 At that time, the Butler Basketball Club was in its infancy, and club founder Randy Butler wanted to use what was happening nationally as a way to teach lessons locally. He organized a "One Island, One Community" basketball game that brought together youths and members of Aquidneck Island's three police departments.
   
 What separated this game from others involving police, Butler said, was the officers and youths playing alongside one another, instead of a kids-against- police contest.
   
 "Back then, what we were trying to do, we were trying to get our community and our police department and to come together and show other communities that it's not always about a police officer killing someone," Butler said during a recent workout at Gaudet Middle School. "We wanted the community-and-police game to show that there's love there. Not every cop is a bad cop."
   
 The game has been played each year since.
   
 "This is amazing, us going out and interacting with the kids like this. They get to see us as just regular people," Jesse Drane, a member of the Newport Police Department, said after the 2019 game.
   
 The "One Island, One Community" game won't be played this summer because of coronavirus restrictions, but Butler said he has some ideas in mind that could allow an event to be held while adhering to social-distance guidelines.
   
 Butler was a star basketball player at Rogers High School in Newport, leading the Vikings to the 1993 state championship. Back then, he said, it was "all about me, me, me," but as he grew older, he recalled some of the advice he was taught by people he respected, including Jim Psaras, his high school basketball coach.
   
 When he started the Butler Basketball Club, Butler wanted to incorporate life lessons into his teachings on the court. Last September, the club held a "Spread Kindness Day," where club members completed acts of kindness -- leaving roses, air fresheners and encouraging notes on vehicles, providing umbrellas at local bus stops, leaving laundry supplies and spare quarters at a local Laundromat and baking cakes and cookies for first responders.
   
 Annette Kearns, an employee at Micki's Mat on Bellevue Avenue, said she assumed the kids were causing trouble, but quickly realized they left behind bags of quarters, detergent, dryer sheets, and postcards. "They made my morning," she said. "I'm really impressed by these children."
   
 At Thanksgiving, the Butler Basketball Club sponsors a turkey giveaway, and in May, when many people were out of work because of the coronavirus, the club gave away 1,600 cases of soup to local residents. The Boston Celtics organization in March 2019 recognized Butler as the Jr. NBA Celtics Coach of the Year.
   
 The Jr. NBA Coach of the Year program is designed to shine a spotlight on youth coaches who make a positive impact within their community.
   
 "Very humbling," Butler told The Daily News after receiving his award. "Someone put my name in, I don't know who, but it's an honor. There are thousands of coaches who could have gotten it before me, and a guy from small little Aquidneck Island won it."
   
 As protests over the killing of George Floyd spread around the country, and calls to "defund the police" grow, Butler looks to mend fences. In June, he organized a community discussion that centered on the racial unrest and confrontation with law enforcement. A week later, about 100 people participated in a unity walk that ended on Washington Square with speakers from the Black community and the Newport Police Department.
   
 "Life isn't just basketball," Butler said. "Life is working, life is respect. I think it's very important that you give back and show them other things that are going on in life, because they're not going to know when adversity hits them in real life."

The Stendig calendar is being made available in India for the first time since it was created in 1966. It's a radically simple, bold design that begs to be the centrepiece of a room. Considered an iconic piece of 1960s modernism, it's been called the greatest calendar of all time -- so what makes it such a big deal and why does it cost Rs 5,600 plus shipping? The 1960s were a revolutionary decade for design, influenced by modern industry and technology. And the late Italian designer Massimo Vignelli was a modernist master of industrial and graphic design. He is credited with popularising in America to the idea of balanced, minimalist, functional design.  For the Stendig wall calendar -- originally created for Stendig Inc, a furniture importer in the US -- Vignelli used his favourite font, Helvetica, a classic component of 1960s modernism. The calendar itself is laid out big and bold, in black and white, on a grid. The specifications, which remain unchanged, are noteworthy. This calendar is 4 ft across and 3 ft high. Held together by a black binding strip, every month alternates between white and black backgrounds. You get to the next month by peeling away the top sheet. The loose leaves usually go on to have a second life as wrapping paper; the back can serve as a blank canvas. Within the year, the calendar had become a design icon, and the Museum of Modern Art purchased a copy for its permanent collection. It remains the only calendar at MOMA. Today, the Stendig is still manufactured at the same site in Nashville, Tennessee, where the first one was printed. Only a limited number are made each year, and they're usually soon gone. Until recently, you could only buy a Stendig calendar from select retailers in the US, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and South Korea. Now, you can buy directly from the Cromwell company publishers, and have one shipped to your home. "We had originally planned to sell only 50 in India, but initial demand has been so strong that we're looking to up this," says Tom Loyd, director of Stendig Calendars. The final number will likely be less than 200, he added.n addition to the iconic calendar, Vignelli, through his US studios, created corporate identities, logos and posters for companies such as American Airlines, Knoll and IBM. He believed, 'If you can design one thing, you can design anything'. He did everything from packaging and warehouse design to branding and furniture. But most famously, Vignelli designed the New York City subway signage, which has remained unchanged for over 50 years (and a subway map that was, sadly, never used).

Many economists think significant hiring may be hard to sustain because employers are operating under a cloud of uncertainty about the virus. Daily confirmed case counts have fallen from 70,000 in June to about 40,000. The decline has leveled off in the past week and the viral caseload remains higher than it was in May and June.
