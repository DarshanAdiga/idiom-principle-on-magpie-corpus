Chanda insisted that when the Commander-in-Chief instructs his ‘Rank and File’ not to be used by people with intentions to get power through illegitimate or dubious means ‘some people’ start perspiring profusely and develop a sudden bout of frenzied loose motion.

Earlier, his family members had also claimed that the UP police had registered false cases against him.

But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a "wisdom of crowds" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes — much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with SBH trading so far below that average target price of $17.57/share, the 10.3% upside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bearish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and downward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bullish and upgrade? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good "signal" to investors in SBH to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Sally Beauty Holdings Inc.

What's really special about this is I think everyone walks away feeling different things. I think at the end of the day, the highlight is that people are walking away thinking that they don't need to be afraid to speak up. I think it's opening up conversations about mental health and erasing that stigma and I'm proud to be a part of that.

The government hopes to usne the Black Saturday fires of 2009 and recovery efforts as a guideline for how to recover and clean damaged property. In the wake of the 2009 bushfires, 3,000 properties were registered to be cleaned up, a task that took five months. If the current figures do not grow at all, the current task is still three times as large as 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The country’s economy will need to recover from the fires, too, says Simon Baptist, chief economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, but it is difficult to put a number on it. He estimates that in six to 12 months there will be a boost to Australia's GDP as reconstruction work gets going. “But of course, the country is poorer, as a lot of capital stock, like buildings, equipment, has been destroyed ahead of time” he says. “What will be missed in the years ahead is the reduction in living standards caused by the early destruction of these assets, such as homes.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “The money that will go into reconstruction could have been used elsewhere if the fires had not happened, but as we will never experience that future, the real losses from the fires will get lost in the focus on quarterly economic data” Baptist says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In the long-term, the fight against bush fires is a fight against climate change. While these fires were not caused by climate change, they have been made worse by it, through the droughts, high temperatures and wind speed. “In Australia, like in the United States, climate change policy has become a highly partisan issue” says Baptist. “This is a huge barrier to action, as any policy change is viewed through an ideological lens.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             At the moment, Australia is heavily dependent on coal mining and exporting, which is its second-largest generator of income. The Prime Minister Scott Morrison famously loves coal, having brought a lump of it into Parliament in 2017 saying “don’t be afraid”.

At that time, we were hearing of peace talks that were being initiated to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table with a possibility of a unity government. The enemy almost succeeded during this détente period as the unity process looked genuine, but it was a plan by the Rhodesians to derail the struggle.

“Due to him being intoxicated, she told him to leave and did not open the door. The accused started to kick the door and the witness phoned the police. While she was on the phone the accused kicked the door with such force the wooden panels began to snap.
 “He eventually managed to kick the door open and enter the premises, where he went into the kitchen and grabbed a knife. He then went into the bathroom.”
 When police arrived they found Johnstone clearly under the influence of drink or drugs.
 “He was immediately hostile towards police,” said Mr McGuigan. “They saw the knife in the bathroom and the accused stated he wanted to fight them. He told them ‘I’m going to leather you both – I’m going to charge you the now’.

The video shows a faint glow in the distance, zig-zagging like a piece of paper caught in an underdraft, slowly meandering towards the horizon. Then there’s a bright flash and the trees in the foreground are thrown into shadow as Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 hits the ground early on the morning of January 8, killing all 176 people on board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            At first, it seemed like an accident – engine failure was fingered as the cause – until the first video showing the plane seemingly on fire as it weaved to the ground surfaced. United States officials started to investigate, and a more complicated picture emerged. It appeared that the plane had been hit by a missile, corroborated by a second video that appears to show the moment the missile ploughs into the Boeing 737-800. While military and intelligence officials at governments around the world were conducting their inquiries in secret, a team of investigators were using open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to piece together the puzzle of flight PS752.

But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a "wisdom of crowds" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes — much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with LSCC trading so far above that average target price of $19.42/share, the -8.54% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good "signal" to investors in LSCC to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Lattice Semiconductor Corp.

  "I'm sure there'll be things in motion on that and there are one or two things we'd hopefully like to get done, but time will tell on that.


  "Hopefully, like a lot of clubs, we will be active. It is a busy period of time, so the club will always keep working towards that and we'll see what comes."

Footage showing a man being detained by officers in Lancashire is being investigated by the police watchdog.
 CCTV footage of the arrest of a man in Accrington has been circulating on social media.
 It was shared on Twitter by Ustadh Mohammad Quraishi - a 'public speaker, presenter and activist'.
 The video shows a man walking down the road, before three police cars pull up, LancsLive reports.
 The man is restrained by four officers. A police dog can also be seen in the footage.
 Lancashire Police said it 'appreciates the concern that perceptions of the officer actions in this video have caused'.
 The force said footage of the arrest will be reviewed by both its professional standards department and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).
 The circumstances leading up to the arrest last Wednesday (January 9) have also been revealed.

I don’t always see eye to eye with Justice Roberts but, on this topic, I couldn’t agree more.


  As a veteran social studies teacher, I can report firsthand and researched data to verify that high stakes standardized testing has had a profoundly negative impact upon the perceived value of the social studies. Because so much emphasis is placed upon math and language arts, social studies takes a back seat far too often and research suggests that this trend, in turn, has a negative impact on test scores.

President Barack Obama, the braggart who taunted then-House Minority Whip Eric Cantor (R-VA) a mere three days after his first inauguration with, "I won," was  _very_ fond of gloating how it was he -- and not his partisan opposition -- who was on the "right side of history." Never mind that Barack Obama, who oversaw a most rancid realignment in the Middle East in favor of the world's number one state sponsor of jihad, kowtowed to that terrorist regime to the tune of $100-150 billion in funding and $1.7 billion in cold, hard pallets of cash.

Only the implementation of the development process is not enough, and sometimes, even active criticism fails to get the job done.

Durante el 2019, la inversión de gobiernos regionales y locales alcanzó los S/12.400 millones; los mismos que fueron destinados a obras de saneamiento, carreteras entre otros proyectos. Sin embargo, el presupuesto asignado para tal función ascendía a S/ 20 mil millones. De ello dio cuenta el presidente Martín Vizcarra en reunión con los alcaldes del país en el marco de la sesión de la Asociación de Municipalidades del Perú (AMPE). ► Tras el cierre de Financiera TFC, ¿cuál es la salud del resto de entidades financieras? ► Nissan considera separación de Renault ante relaciones difíciles “Hay S/7.600 millones que no se gastaron. Debemos ser más eficaces. El año tiene 12 meses y no podemos esperar al último trimestre para poner el esfuerzo en ejecutar”, dijo Vizcarra, quien estuvo acompañado de la ministra de Economía, María Antonieta Alva, el presidente del Consejo de Ministros, Vicente Zeballos, y el contralor Nelson Shack. Asimismo, Vizcarra resaltó la necesidad de elevar el nivel de ejecución a ratios del 80%. “Hay una gran deuda que tenemos como autoridades con la ciudadanía. Hay que construir y es necesario trabajar una nueva metodología. Destrabar y dinamizar la inversión pública”, resaltó. Vizcarra reconoció que el esfuerzo por mejorar la ejecución debe venir de todos los sectores; incluso del Ejecutivo. “Por ejemplo, la transferencia del canon es hasta el último día de julio. Y lo que hace el MEF es depositar justo ese día. Pero la norma no dice eso. Incluso teniendo los recursos antes, esperaba el último día de julio. Se les pedía eficiencia cuando disponían del presupuesto los últimos cinco meses”, dijo. En el 2019, el canon se transfirió en marzo y para el 2020, Vizcarra destacó que “se hará el esfuerzo para transferirlo en febrero”. “Pondremos metas trimestrales que se dividen en metas mensuales para mejorar la ejecución”, dijo. A su turno, el presidente de la AMPE, Álvaro Paz de la Barra, resaltó la necesidad de trabajar una nueva metodología de la inversión e incluso estandarizar algunas obras para facilitar su ejecución. “Así como pedimos recursos, también debemos pedir mayores responsabilidades. Porque no hemos venido siendo tan eficientes como lo espera la ciudadanía“, dijo. La AMPE trabajará mesas temáticas con el objetivo de que cada alcalde explique sus problemas al momento de ejecutar.

The academy, notably, dramatically expanded its membership after the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag put the issues of diversity and inclusion under the microscope four years ago. The fact those efforts produced modest results this year -- with women excluded from the directing nominations, and just two actors of color -- should produce some soul-searching, not just regarding the organization, but the nature of the industry itself.

While our Tinder-tuned era has humans projecting “pick-me!” appeal, we’re learning to be less shallow when it comes to swiping for our stays. Rather than judging on looks or luxury alone, we’re heading into a new decade with our eco-instincts honed. I’m still seduced by good looks, but it’s gratifying to scratch the surface and discover forward-thinking, back-of house behaviour. Tropical islands can gush all they like about their white sand beaches – but if they’re run on dirty diesel guzzling generators, it’s an instant deal- breaker.

So, the long, slow, careful attempt of the U.S. and its European allies to reverse history and establish a reasonable diplomatic relationship with Iran was disrupted: first, by the cancellation of the "Iran Nuclear Deal" in 2018; second, by the quixotic decision to assassinate Soleimani.

ATLANTA (AP) — Ivanka Trump is expected to travel to Atlanta on Tuesday to tour facilities that help human trafficking survivors. The president’s daughter and adviser will be accompanied by Gov. Brian Kemp, first lady Marty Kemp, U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, and other Trump administration officials at a safe house near downtown Atlanta. They'll hear from its operators, as well as from survivors who will tell their stories and share how they have benefited from the shelter, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The group will also visit Wellspring Living’s Women’s Academy, a nonprofit that helps survivors with recovery, where a roundtable discussion will be held. Both President Donald Trump and the Kemp administration have listed fighting sex trafficking as a priority, the newspaper said. Ivanka Trump said she looks forward to visiting Atlanta to work with survivors and agencies “to end the evil scourge of modern slavery once and for all.” Ivanka Trump’s last visit to Atlanta was in February, when she toured UPS facilities.

Crisis talks on the future of Duke and Duchess of Sussex are taking place at Sandringham today following the couple’s announcement last week that they are taking a step back from Royal duties to spend more time in North America.


  Since then there has been feverish speculation as to the reasons behind the Sussexes decision and which of them has driven it.


  In a letter published in The Sun, Mr Fabricant asserts that the Duke and Duchess’s decision could be “a wonderful opportunity” for both the Royal Family and the country at large.


  “While their methods and approach to royal duties may not always fall in line with tradition, there is no doubting that Harry and Meghan are seen by many of the younger generation as symbols of a new, modern, vibrant monarchy.

 Orrin Edward Hoblyn, 82, of Mason City, Neb. died Monday, Jan. 6, 2020 at his home near Mason City. Orrin was born to Frank and Maude (Nelson) Hoblyn on a farm southwest of Ansley on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 26, 1937. He was educated at Harris and Hawk country schools, then attended and graduated from Ansley High School in 1955. After graduation he worked for Brown and Denesia in Broken Bow doing cement work for a year. Orrin joined the National Guard Reserve in 1956 and served his country for two years. Orrin wanted to farm his whole life. He would go around the countryside shearing sheep which earned him enough money to buy seed corn for that year's crop. He first rented and farmed land around the Berwyn area, the opportunity came along to rent a farm one and a half miles east of Mason City. After renting the farm for one year he was giving the opportunity to purchase the farm, which he did in 1965 and made his home there for his entire life. He married Cathie Skala on April 15, 1969 at their home on the farm. Their oldest daughter, Amy Lynn, was born Aug. 17, 1969 and their youngest daughter, Donna Kay, was born May 26, 1974. In the 80s the couple bought up several parcels of land to expand their operation and ran around 200 head in the cow calf operation. Orrin loved those Hereford cows and calving them out and watching them grow. There were also some ol' black and white cows on the farm for forty years, but he really never liked them, but the dairy helped to make him a living. In the mid 80s, they won the bid for the rural star route and for 14 months of their two-year contract they carried mail. Orrin would mostly handle do it when the weather was bad. Orrin also enjoyed hunting, whether it be pheasant hunting with Michigan friends, deer and coyote hunting in Nebraska or elk hunting in Colorado with Ope, Ronnie and Tim, he truly loved to hunt. He also enjoyed trapping. The grandkids called him Eagle Eye. He taught the grandsons to hunt and trap. Orrin also enjoyed going to all kinds of auctions, the one auction he enjoyed the most was the Central City Community Auction held on every Thursday night. If there was a good bargain to be had Orrin and Bobby Lucas were always there to get it. Orrin was a plumber, electrician, mechanic, and a carpenter. He was a jack of all trades. He could fix anything. He was a night owl and could be seen in the fields many a night 'til nearly morning in his John Deere tractor. Orrin didn't know a stranger and loved a good visit. He had a nickname for everyone. He was a very loving, caring, and patient man. He would always give the gift of his time to everyone. He had an optimistic attitude for life. He recently made the comment to Cathie that the best thing he ever did was having his children Amy and Donna and grandchildren that he so loved and enjoyed dearly. He had wonderful and fun times with them all. He loved to reminisce and tell them stories about the good old days and joked around a lot. As Orrin's health declined, he shifted to advice giver instead of being a work horse on the farm, but never considered himself retired. He gave advice and guidance daily on the farm's management. Right before Christmas, Orrin opened his heart and made the most important decision of his life in accepting Christ as his Savior. Orrin is survived by his wife Cathie Hoblyn of Mason City; daughters Amy Hoblyn of Ansley and Donna (Shain) Hoblyn-Bittner of Mason City; five grandchildren Michael Shoemaker, Joey Hoblyn-Hill and friend Lakota Prentice, Chancey and Jacob Hoblyn-Bittner and Wyatt Hoblyn-Shoemaker; two step-great grandchildren Paiton and Madi Tucker; sister Frances (Calvin) Evans of Ansley; brother Richard Hoblyn of Cheyenne, Wyo.; and numerous nieces, nephews and cousins. Orrin was preceded in death by his parents, a sister Rachel and an infant sister. Memorial services were Thurs. Jan. 9, 2010 at 11 a.m. at the First Baptist Church in Mason City with Pastor Scott Harvey officiating. Inurnment will be at a later date. Memorials are suggested to the Ansley and Mason City Fire and Rescue or the Mason City Baptist Church. Govier Brothers Mortuary assisted the family. Words of encouragement and remembrance may be left at www.govierbrothers.com.

But he rarely drew a contrast with his opponents on the trail, even when asked directly, and even some of Booker's supporters worried his message on Trump wasn't sharp enough to go up against a Republican president known for dragging his opponents into the mud.

Athens [Greece], Jan 12 (ANI): At least 12 people were killed after a migrant smuggling boat sank near the island of Paxos in western Greece on Saturday, authorities said.   The Greek Coast Guard told The New York Times that bodies of the 12 people were recovered from the Ionian Sea near the west coast of Greece.   The authorities were alerted that the vessel was in trouble shortly after 9 a.m. (local time), when one of the migrants on board phoned the emergency services. No details were immediately available about the identities of the victims.   The cause of the sinking was also unclear, according to the Coast Guard spokesman, Nikolaos Lagadianos. Weather conditions had been good, he said.   But the boat may have been overloaded, he added, noting that about 50 people may have been on board.   A large search-and-rescue operation was underway, the Coast Guard said, with six Coast Guard vessels scouring the area alongside two Air Force helicopters, a Navy helicopter and four fishing boats.   He added that 21 people had so far been rescued. (ANI)

An early focus on building out a strong and seasoned campaign operation in Iowa and South Carolina may have hampered his campaign in the long run, as the resources he spent early on staff there left him working with a tight budget in the later stages of the primary, when many of his opponents were going on air with television ads. That meant that even later in the campaign, after he had collected some of the top endorsements in Iowa and visited South Carolina almost more than any other candidate, a significant portion of the electorate in both states either said they were unfamiliar with his campaign or viewed him unfavorably.

_REAL LIFE. At some point in my life, I lived in this type of neighbourhood and I know what life here looks like.I decided to pay a visit and rub minds with some of the people there. One thing I noticed is that even with the gifts I brought, there was disunity, people trying to cheat each other, people pushing other people 's children away so that their own children will get double. It got me thinking, when will we change this "dog eat dog" attitude of ours as a nation? When will we unite as a people and fight our common enemy: POVERTY the fight is against poverty, not against one another_

Manila [Philippines], Jan 13 (ANI): About 8,000 residents were evacuated after a small active volcano near Manila spewed a massive cloud of ash on Sunday that drifted across the city, as experts warned of another possibility of "hazardous explosive eruption."   People residing near the Taal volcano and other high-risk areas were asked to leave by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council after it suddenly shot a column of ash and steam as high as 15 kilometres (9 miles) into the sky, Al Jazeera reported.   Taal, one of the world's smallest active volcanoes, sits in the middle of a lake about 70km (45 miles) south of the centre of Manila.   Authorities said there was a risk an eruption could cause a tsunami in the lake.   "Taal is a very small volcano but a dangerous volcano," said Renato Solidum, head of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. "It is unique because it is a volcano within a volcano."   The institute raised the danger level posed by the volcano to 4 out of a possible 5 - meaning "hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days". The highest alert is level 5 issued when a magmatic eruption is underway.   The Philippines lies on the Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.   One of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines, Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, most recently in 1977.   Meanwhile, the spewing ash forced the cancellation of 172 flights in and out of the international airport on Sunday. Authorities said flights would also be suspended on Monday because there was ash on the runway.   President Rodrigo Duterte's office further ordered the suspension of government work in the capital and of all school classes in Manila and other areas affected by the ash. Health officials warned of possible breathing problems for people with respiratory ailments and urged the public to stay indoors and use dust masks when going out. (ANI)

In my Hip Hop Pedagogy courses, K-12 teachers and college instructors learn how to tap into the richness of hip-hop culture to engage students in topics that range from Shakespeare to neuroscience. But I also stress the need to be authentic - in other words, don't lie about where you are from - and steer clear of gimmicky hip-hop instructional strategies, such as parroting hip-hop lingo out of context, or showing a random rap video that has nothing to do with the course subject.

Orrin Edward Hoblyn, 82, of Mason City, Neb. died Monday, Jan. 6, 2020 at his home near Mason City.      Orrin was born to Frank and Maude (Nelson) Hoblyn on a farm southwest of Ansley on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 26, 1937. He was educated at Harris and Hawk country schools, then attended and graduated from Ansley High School in 1955.      After graduation he worked for Brown and Denesia in Broken Bow doing cement work for a year. Orrin joined the National Guard Reserve in 1956 and served his country for two years.      Orrin wanted to farm his whole life. He would go around the countryside shearing sheep which earned him enough money to buy seed corn for that year's crop. He first rented and farmed land around the Berwyn area, the opportunity came along to rent a farm one and a half miles east of Mason City. After renting the farm for one year he was giving the opportunity to purchase the farm, which he did in 1965 and made his home there for his entire life.      He married Cathie Skala on April 15, 1969 at their home on the farm. Their oldest daughter, Amy Lynn, was born Aug. 17, 1969 and their youngest daughter, Donna Kay, was born May 26, 1974.      In the 80s the couple bought up several parcels of land to expand their operation and ran around 200 head in the cow calf operation. Orrin loved those Hereford cows and calving them out and watching them grow. There were also some ol' black and white cows on the farm for forty years, but he really never liked them, but the dairy helped to make him a living.      In the mid 80s, they won the bid for the rural star route and for 14 months of their two-year contract they carried mail. Orrin would mostly handle do it when the weather was bad.      Orrin also enjoyed hunting, whether it be pheasant hunting with Michigan friends, deer and coyote hunting in Nebraska or elk hunting in Colorado with Ope, Ronnie and Tim, he truly loved to hunt. He also enjoyed trapping. The grandkids called him "Eagle Eye." He taught the grandsons to hunt and trap.      Orrin also enjoyed going to all kinds of auctions, the one auction he enjoyed the most was the Central City Community Auction held on every Thursday night. If there was a good bargain to be had Orrin and Bobby Lucas were always there to get it.      Orrin was a plumber, electrician, mechanic, and a carpenter. He was a jack of all trades. He could fix anything. He was a night owl and could be seen in the fields many a night 'til nearly morning in his John Deere tractor.      Orrin didn't know a stranger and loved a good visit. He had a nickname for everyone. He was a very loving, caring, and patient man. He would always give the gift of his time to everyone. He had an optimistic attitude for life.      He recently made the comment to Cathie that the best thing he ever did was having his children Amy and Donna and grandchildren that he so loved and enjoyed dearly. He had wonderful and fun times with them all. He loved to reminisce and tell them stories about the good old days and joked around a lot.      As Orrin's health declined, he shifted to advice giver instead of being a work horse on the farm, but never considered himself retired. He gave advice and guidance daily on the farm's management. Right before Christmas, Orrin opened his heart and made the most important decision of his life in accepting Christ as his Savior.      Orrin is survived by his wife Cathie Hoblyn of Mason City; daughters Amy Hoblyn of Ansley and Donna (Shain) Hoblyn-Bittner of Mason City; five grandchildren Michael Shoemaker, Joey Hoblyn-Hill and friend Lakota Prentice, Chancey and Jacob Hoblyn-Bittner and Wyatt Hoblyn-Shoemaker; two step-great grandchildren Paiton and Madi Tucker; sister Frances (Calvin) Evans of Ansley; brother Richard Hoblyn of Cheyenne, Wyo.; and numerous nieces, nephews and cousins.      Orrin was preceded in death by his parents, a sister Rachel and an infant sister.      Memorial services were Thurs. Jan. 9, 2010 at 11 a.m. at the First Baptist Church in Mason City with Pastor Scott Harvey officiating. Inurnment will be at a later date.      Memorials are suggested to the Ansley and Mason City Fire and Rescue or the Mason City Baptist Church.      Govier Brothers Mortuary assisted the family.

What has enabled their continued success is the music, which is, for the most part, a collage of forcefully down-tuned guitars, thundering percussion, samples, turntables, vocal styles than run the gamut from screaming and growling to discernibly melodic, and lyrics that explore (perhaps unsurprisingly) topics such as nihilism, isolation, psychotic behaviour and misanthropy.

Snap's move into video games, a growing user base and an improving ability to increase its average revenue from users have been cited as the big drivers behind the rally. Just like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) who also boasts a huge daily active user base, it's all about the monetization and for a company that can boast over 200 million daily active users, it appears they're only just starting to scratch the surface of efficiently doing so. Last week's $166 million acquisition of Ukranian start-up, AI Factory, shows the company is focused on continuing to innovate to help maintain the momentum.

I don't want to give too much away but I think that Evan didn't really know Connor very well. I think what's interesting is that Zoe and the Murphy family hear things that they're unfamiliar with. That's why it takes Zoe a while to navigate her grief, because she's hearing things that she had never witnessed from Connor or could imagine in her wildest dreams.

The success of the past few series of Love Island makes it, unquestionably, ITV2’s flagship show. An all-new series brings with it a new ratings challenge – one that last year’s offering won as six million people tuned in to watch the most popular episode, breaking a previous Love Island record. The broadcaster will also be hoping to win big in terms of advertising revenue, with double the opportunity to sell 30 second slots during the main show for the reported sum of £45,000 each. No wonder, then, that ITV is keen to squeeze every last drop from the Franchise with a winter series before its popularity inevitably begins to wane.

Tehran [Iran], Jan 12 (ANI): British Ambassador to Iran Rob Macaire was temporarily arrested on Saturday evening amid the ongoing anti-regime protests in Tehran in the wake of the Iranian Guards' 'unintentional' downing of a Ukrainian plane last week that killed 176 people on board, the country's Tasnim news agency reported.   The agency said that Macaire was attempting "to organise, instigate and direct some radical and destructive action."   Reports on social media also indicated that the envoy may have been taking photographs of the protest, Times of Israel reported.   The state media further said that Macair was released after several hours but could be summoned later for further questioning.   Meanwhile, the British government reacted over the development with outrage. "The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law," said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.   Raab added that the Iranian government was "at a crossroads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forward."   Thousands of people gathered in the Iranian capital on Saturday to stage protest after the regime admitted to having accidentally shot down a Boeing plane on early Wednesday, hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing US troops in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in an American airstrike in Baghdad.   Dozens of those who died in the plane crash were young Iranian students travelling to their studies in Canada.   Police dispersed the protesters with tear gas, according to reports and videos on social media. There were also reports of numerous arrests. (ANI)

The crash of the Ukraine International Airlines jet early Wednesday killed all 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians. For three days, Iranian officials ruled out any strike on the plane, suggesting the crash of Flight 752 was caused by a technical failure. Only on Saturday did authorities acknowledge shooting it down, as evidence mounted and after Western leaders accused Iran of culpability.

They then look at the footage itself, trying often to geolocate precisely where the video or images were taken, in what direction the taker was standing, and what happened. It involves carefully examining every building, street sign and road seen in the footage and trying to map it onto satellite imagery. In the case of the second video of the Iran incident, the footage showed several buildings that Bellingcat and news organisation Newsy were able to identify as a residential area in Parand, a city near Tehran’s airport. By mapping the location of the images, they’re able to use tools such as Google Street View to match up the buildings and landmarks they see in the video frame to what’s in front of them. A construction site, apartment blocks and street lights helped in this instance – allowing them to identify the taker was facing northeastwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The investigators then looked at what they heard, as well as saw, in the video. Identifying when the bang of the explosion was heard, combined with some maths (Pythagoras’s theory of triangles) and the known flight path of the downed airline from open source flight trackers such as FlightRadar24, allowed them to confirm that the aircraft in the video was PS752. When more than one video is available, the investigators will try and cross-check them against each other, syncing up a key moment in a video to corroborate that both support each other’s claims.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            From there, investigators move to other available imagery, this time of the aftermath of the crash. The crash site has reportedly been hastily bulldozed by Iranian authorities, reducing the likelihood that an official investigation will find any smoking gun for attribution. (Higgins says he has proof of that but from a confidential source, which means he can’t publish the photograph showing it.)

Just because a car looks good in a video or on a website doesn't mean all is 100% OK. Collector cars are old, and there are many out there that are in business to make a quick buck. Selling a car that is not what it is advertised does happen, so let the buyer beware. Pictured is the author's 1980 AMC Concord, which was purchased online and turned out to be exactly as advertised. He still owns this classic, low cost, Rambler. [Greg Zyla]

"This is a brilliant club and I'm very excited about playing for Hibernian," he told the club's website. __


  "I've heard so many good things about Hibernian and everything seems right about this move, so I cannot wait for it all to begin."


  Dja Djedje scored eight goals in 64 appearances for Arles-Avignon and Nice from 2010 to 2012, and since January 2013 has been on the scoresheet intermittently at Chornomorets Odesa in Ukraine, Sarpsborg and Dinamo Minsk.


  Before signing, he sought the advice of forward Hibs player Sol Bamba.


  "Sol is a close friend of mine and he told me all about Hibernian, Edinburgh and Scottish football," he added.


  "He told me that I should take this opportunity because I would enjoy playing here.


  "My objective is to help the club to achieve promotion this year by scoring goals and helping the team."


  He will be available to play in Saturday's home match against Falkirk once the signing paperwork has been completed.


  Alan Stubbs, the Easter Road head coach, believes the Ivorian will add quality to the squad.


  "We're really excited that we've managed to get Franck on board - he will give us another dimension in attack," he said.


  "Franck is an intelligent player, who has got good movement. He is quick and he scores goals.


  "We're delighted that we've managed to sign him and we welcome him into the squad."

Strategy factored in as teams had to consider their players' strengths in the various modes of play, and the doubles teams conversed often during and between points to get on the same page.

For the 14th year, the Terrebonne Parish Tree Board is helping you help south Louisiana.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The board's annual Tree Giveaway will take place Jan. 25 at Houma's Main Library, 151 Library Drive, with the hope that the benefits of trees to the local ecosystem will continue and grow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "In planting these trees, citizens are helping to make Terrebonne Parish a greener, healthier and more beautiful place to live," the board says in a news release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The giveaway is sponsored by Apache Corp., which will donate 200 potted saplings available first-come, first-served. The board will also provide at least 800 bare-root seedlings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Members of La-Terre Master Gardeners and representatives from the LSU AgCenter will help residents choose the right tree from a selection of native Louisiana species. They will also provide educational pamphlets that instruct citizens on how to plant and care for their tree of choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Some of the benefits of planting a tree include improvement in the quality of air, soil and water, helping the absorption of storm water (one mature tree can absorb nearly 900 gallons per day), decreasing the rate of land subsidence and cooling surrounding air temperatures by 6-8 degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The event begins at 9 a.m. and lasts until the saplings are gone. There is a limit of two saplings per household.

UNK somehow found a way to win despite being down 23-9, having three key players foul out, seeing a potential game-winning 3 rim out at the end of regulation and missing several late free throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “When you look at how the game started they were rolling. We had to find a way to stay in it and we did that. We kept it (the deficit) around nine or 10 and then got to halftime. When we got to halftime I told them they played great and it’s only a nine-point game,” Lofton said. “We just got to be gritty and who we want to be. It’s a process ... you just don’t wake up and do it. You have to go through fire and we did that a little bit today,”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Winchester was a big reason why the Lopers overcame all that by tallying a season-high 15 points with eight of that coming in overtime. He nailed a 3 to give UNK a 71-70 lead early in overtime and then sunk another one with 61 seconds left to give the Lopers the lead for good, 79-77.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            NSU had a chance to tie the game but committed a turnover, and Winchester followed with two made free throws. The RiverHawks came back to make two free throws with UNK missing two chances at the line. The Lopers finished 13 of 23 at the free-throw line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            After a timeout, NSU had a chance to win it or force more time but redshirt senior guard Kendrick Thompson lost control of the ball driving to the bucket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Chase had a look in his eye on the bench. We were running Cedric (Johnson) out there .. he was doing OK but Chase was chomping at the bit to get back in there. He took that one three wide open and missed it but he came back and stuck the next one and it was game one,” Lofton said. “(Assistant coach) Antoine Young and I were debating zone, man, zone, man there at the end. We decided on man but as soon as they were about to inbound I said, ‘We should’ve gone zone.’ And then he drove it in there ... we just didn’t want to give up a three.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Winchester finally sealed the game with two free throws. He ended the day 3 of 5 from the floor and 7 of 7 at the free-throw line while also having four assists and a rebound in 28 minutes.

The drivers told police they had been at a pool hall earlier in the night, according to the arrest citation.

Perry is also gearing up for his new movie on Netflix called "Tyler Perry's A Fall From Grace", which just dropped a trailer a few days ago. You'd think with so many shows, movies and the responsibility of running an entire studio, Perry would delegate tasks to other writers.

Some of the clips in this incident surfaced on Telegram, the encrypted messaging app popular in the Middle East, while others were sent directly to Bellingcat. “Because Bellingcat is known for our open source work on MH17, people immediately thought of us. People started sending us links they'd found,” says Eliot Higgins of Bellingcat. “It was involuntary crowdsourcing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            OSINT investigators then utilise metadata, including EXIF data – which is automatically inserted into videos and photos, showing everything from the type of camera used to take the images to the precise latitude and longitude of where the taker was standing – to validify that the footage is legitimate. They’ll also try and identify who took the footage, and whether it’s practical for them to have been where they claim to have been at the time. However, for this instance, they couldn’t use EXIF data. “People would share photos and videos on Telegram which strip the metadata, and then someone else would find that and share it on Twitter,” says Higgins. “We were really getting a second-hand or third-hand version of these images. All we have to go on is what’s visible in the photograph.” So instead they moved onto the next step.

Nigerien President Mahamadou Issoufou has replaced the head of the army after two of the country's deadliest attacks in living memory killed at least 160 soldiers and prompted a rethink in the battle against jihadist groups, the government said. Ahmed Mohamed led the army for over two years, a period marked by a steep rise in attacks by militants linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda that culminated in a daytime raid on a remote army base on Thursday that killed at least 89 soldiers.

Stockton is not alone. Councils across the country have spent £775m on buying up shopping centres in the last three years - one in five of those that have changed hands - according to research by retail property organisation Revo and real estate consultancy Lambert Smith Hampton. Some worry about the risk to taxpayers of councils borrowing money to purchase property.


  But David Renard, chair of the Local Government Association's board of economy, environment, housing and transport, says in the right circumstances it's the right approach.


  "I think each location needs to make their own choices and decisions on that. Some authorities clearly have. They feel that's the right thing, to be able to have ownership," he says.


  "There's no doubt that if you own something, it is far easier to regenerate it and do what you want to. So, I think it's a case of horses for courses."

It doesn't happy often -- sadly -- but every now and then, a leftist blogger or journalist wakes up to the fact that his or her fellow progressives are all too willing to suck up to dictatorial regimes if they believe doing so helps them politically. Case in point: Huffington Post contributor Yashar Ali, who tries to explain to his fellow liberals that what they're doing -- siding with the Mad Mullahs and _against_ freedom-loving Iranians -- is wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            With regard to the massive protests that have broken out in Iran, Yashar explains that "all the family/friends I spoke to who live in different parts of Iran) are furious that they were lied to for three days about the case of the plane crash. The Iranian government lied left and right about where the plan was headed" and what "brought down the plane." In other words, "The Iranian government completely mishandled the plane crash, destroying evidence in the process. Iranians are in the street calling for death to the Supreme Leader (something that could get them executed). Iranians are in the street calling for prosecutions, saying Soleimani is a murderer. Telling leadership of the Iranian government to resign and saying Trump isn't the problem, that the Iranian government is."

Maybe Pedro Almodóvar’s “Pain & Glory," maybe Rian Johnson’s “Knives Out,” maybe Terrence Malick’s “A Hidden Life,” maybe Lulu Wang’s “The Farewell” (for my money, the year’s most enchanting journey).

For instance, in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn fell far short of the support he needed from his parliamentary colleagues to get onto the ballot paper. Fortunately for him, and unfortunately for the party’s electoral prospects, there were enough fools and opportunists in the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) who chose to signal their Left-wing virtue to their local members by “lending” him their nomination. It was only then that Corbyn’s popularity among the grassroots became evident, and the rest is history.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Louisiana's new Legislature is starting with a dispute over House speaker, just like the old Legislature did four years ago. The 105 members of the House and 39 members of the Senate take their oaths of office Monday as the new term of state government begins, with Republicans taking over a two-thirds majority in the Senate and nearing that supermajority in the House. The Senate quietly worked out its leadership decisions behind closed doors, with Republican Page Cortez, a former high school football coach and furniture store owner from Lafayette, appearing to secure the votes in the majority-GOP chamber needed to become Senate president. But House grappling over its top job has become an angry public brawl, with Republicans feuding about their two contenders for speaker — GOP Reps. Sherman Mack of Albany and Clay Schexnayder of Gonzales. Voting on the elected jobs will happen after lawmakers are sworn in Monday morning. Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry and Republican U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, along with a majority of GOP House members, are supporting Mack, a lawyer who has led the House criminal justice committee. However, Mack has been unable to scrape together the 53 votes among the 68 Republicans in the chamber, as Schexnayder, a car repair business owner, maintained support from a small group of GOP lawmakers. That left both men trying to negotiate with Democrats to try to win the speaker's chair — an outcome Landry and Kennedy had wanted to avoid. The competition grew bitter as the weeks dragged on, with a PAC overseen by Landry and Kennedy attacking some Republicans who refused to support Mack. In previous terms, legislative leadership decisions have been brokered in backroom negotiations settled days, if not weeks, ahead of...

All Galaxy S20 Models Rumored to Feature 12GB LPDDR5 RAM as Part of Their Base Configuration
 The device was running on a Qualcomm chip codenamed “Kona” which essentially confirms that it is the Snapdragon 865. As usual, only users in the US, Canada, and China will be able to buy a Snapdragon-powered Galaxy S20. This particular variant of the Galaxy S20 seems to be running 12GB of RAM, which is very likely going to be standard with all models. It also confirms that the device will run Android 10 out of the box, powered by One UI 2.1 and not One UI 2.0. Perhaps Samsung has some exclusive features in store for us, and that's why it bumped the build version up a notch.

Back in the day they had a ranking system, so one of my cover videos was ranked #20 most viewed in Canada. I do mostly cover songs and I like to throw in a vlog once in a while. Especially being on tour since we hit up some cool spots.

Kiev [Ukraine], Jan 12 (ANI): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday said that he expects a full investigation as well as an admission of guilt and compensation from the Iran regime following the downing of the country Boeing passenger plane last week.   Zelenskyy's comments came shortly after Tehran said it had mistakenly shot down the plane killing all 176 people on board on January 8, on the same day it struck military bases hosting US troops in retaliation for Washington's assassination of top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani last week, Al Jazeera reported.   "Iran has pleaded guilty to crashing the Ukrainian plane. But we insist on a full admission of guilt," Zelenskyy wrote on Facebook.   "We expect from Iran assurances of their readiness for a full and open investigation, bringing those responsible to justice, the return of the bodies of the dead, the payment of compensation, official apologies through diplomatic channels," he said.   "Our 45 experts must get full access and cooperation to establish justice," he added.   Iran said that its military "unintentionally" shot down the Ukrainian jetliner, blaming "human error" for the incident in which the military mistook Flight 752 for a "hostile target".   The country's state broadcaster Press TV had also quoted Iran's armed forces as saying that the plane had flown close to a "sensitive military site".   The military said it was at its "highest level of readiness" amid the heightened tensions with the United States. It apologised and said it would upgrade its systems to prevent future tragedies.   Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in a statement posted on social media, wrote that the country "deeply regrets this disastrous mistake".   Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also said that "human error at the time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to the disaster".   Iran had denied for several days that a missile downed the aircraft, calling such suggestions "psychological warfare". But then the US and Canada, citing intelligence, said they believed Iran had shot down the aircraft.   The jetliner, a Boeing 737-800 operated by Ukraine International Airlines, went down on the outskirts of Tehran during takeoff just hours after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at US forces in Iraq.   The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians when it was shot down.

"They're both just really strong-willed and hard-headed, you know how it is, two alphas going at it against each other and they're going to butt heads every once in a while," veteran center Sean Pollard said. "They're very similar and it's actually a fun time to just watch those two interact with each other."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Carman summed it up by saying, "We're both tough competitors, really nasty players, guys that love to get into the middle of all the action. He's helped me a lot with off-the-field things and I've helped coach him on the field. Our relationship has really grown and I'm glad to have him as a teammate."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <span

Senator Bernie Sanders has big -- and unaffordable -- plans for America. His most important talking point? Free education, baby! That's right, under a Sanders Administration, public colleges and universities will no longer be allowed to charge students tuition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It has long been one of the talking points of the far-left in Europe: making lower education free. Having said that, even the progressive movement in countries like the Netherlands have a limitation. They're talking about primary schools and high schools, _not_ about universities and colleges. Amazingly, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders takes it one step (or ten) further. By "free education" he actually means...  _free education_ , from the cradle to the grave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "When we talk about free public education, it must include making public colleges and universities tuition-free," Sanders recently told a crowd of supporters at a rally. "And if we can give massive tax breaks to the one percent and large profitable corporations, we can cancel all student debt in America."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This is truly radical. Making education free -- from the start of a person's educational career to the very end of it -- is extremely costly. "Costly?" I hear millennial readers ask. Yes, costly. You see, making colleges and universities "tuition-free" will actually just shift the costs from those who actually use the service -- students -- to  _taxpayers_. When socialist radicals like Sanders say "free," they actually mean "let someone else pay for it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That's troubling enough, but wait, it gets even worse. If people can study whatever they please while someone else gets stuck with the bill, you'll undoubtedly see a significant increase in the student population. This means that paying for education will cost taxpayers _even more  _than Sanders thinks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Oh, and another negative effect Sanders would rather not tell you about free education will cause more students to opt for party-studies that won't actually result in them getting a well-paid job. Enrollment for Gender Studies (OMG) will spike to never-before-seen levels. Guess how much those "students" will start paying in taxes once they're "graduated"?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Insane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And that's putting it mildly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lastly, Sanders compares making education tuition-free to tax cuts, which is pretty crazy in itself. After all, tax cuts mean that individuals and businesses can keep more  _of their own money_. Getting rid of tuition, on the other hand, means that someone else is paying for students' education. Unlike "free education," cutting taxes doesn't cost anyone else money. It just means that people keep more of their own profits (and that the government can spend less).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            But yeah, try to explain that to Sanders' millennial fanboys.

In follow-up interviews of more than 600 people at Hannaford Supermarket locations in Portsmouth, Manchester and Concord and almost 500 people at Market Basket stores in Bedford, Epping and Concord, nearly 9 in 10 respondents said the same thing.


  Brothers Stewart and William Yeaton, of Epsom, are fifth-generation dairy farmers working a 300-acre farm with 110 milking cows, who produce about 320,000 gallons of milk a year.


  Stewart Yeaton, who supports effort to help Granite State dairy farmers, said there is something special about locally produced milk.


  “Everybody wants to know where their food is coming from. We’re a local producer. You can see us. You see us out going kind of slow with our farm equipment on the side of the roads, or you may smell the countryside when we spread our cow manure, but the big thing is, we’re a local producer and you know the milk is coming here from New Hampshire, and it’s not coming from the Midwest or out of the country,” Stewart Yeaton said.


  Last Wednesday, Stewart Yeaton talked to Shawn Jasper, the commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets & Food, at his farm with media present.


  Jasper said they are encouraging consumers to talk to store managers at Hannaford, Market Basket, Shaw’s and Walmart so HP Hood in Concord can see the economic benefit of providing premium milk.


  “There’s no reason at this point that Hannaford and Market Basket shouldn’t be on board. Where do you go where 85 percent of your consumers, your customers, want something and you’re not willing to give it to them? It’s mind-boggling to me. Their customers want this,” Jasper said.


  Amy Flynn-Hall, executive director at Granite State Dairy Promotion, said consumers constantly ask how they can help local farmers beyond buying the milk their stores stock. She is disappointed more retailers have not put pressure on processors to produce premium milk and support those farmers.


  “Right now, it’s up to the retailers to say, ‘We want to give our consumers and our shoppers what they want.’ So, where we are in the process is, we just want to sit down and have a meeting with a retailer and it’s lost on us, and it’s completely lost on the consumers, why a meeting can’t even happen,” Flynn-Hall said.


  Officials from Hannaford and Market Basket could not be reached for comment.

Higbee doesn’t necessarily get all the credit he should as a blocker, either. He was strong in that department this season, both in the running game and in pass protection. Against the Bears, he was asked to block Khalil Mack one-on- one a couple times and held his own in those situations.

But even the Australian Electoral Commission isn't perfect. As I detail in my book, like-minded people naturally cluster together in communities. That creates what some scholars have called "unintentional gerrymandering." In the U.S., for example, Democratic voters overconcentrated in urban areas are unavoidably consolidated into districts with large Democratic supermajorities. That partially explains why, until recently, Republicans controlled the Virginia state legislature for years, even as Democrats won all the statewide and presidential elections.

MALCOLM BRIGHT (Tom Payne, "The Walking Dead") has a gift. He knows how killers think and how their minds work. Why? Back in the 1990s, his father was one of the worst, a notorious serial killer called "The Surgeon." So it makes sense Bright is the best criminal psychologist around; murder is THE FAMILY business. He will use his twisted genius to help the NYPD solve crimes and stop killers, all while dealing with a manipulative mother, annoyingly normal sister, a homicidal father still looking to bond with his prodigal son, and his own constantly evolving neuroses.

Pass rush. Ford's return opened things up for the entire defensive line leading to a six-sack performance. Ford got one to force a field-goal attempt late in the first half following an interception by Garoppolo. Rookie Nick Bosa got two of his own, while Arik Armstead, DeForest Buckner and Solomon Thomas each got one. Ford's speed off the edge opened up opportunities for everyone else on the defensive line.

Tehran [Iran], Jan 12 (ANI): A group of Iranian demonstrators on Saturday demanded the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down as protests hit central Tehran after its military mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian plane, killing all 176 people on board last week.   "Commander-in-chief [Khamenei] resign, resign," videos posted on Twitter showed hundreds of people chanting in front of Tehran's Amir Kabir University.   Earlier on Saturday, Iran said its military had shot down the Ukrainian plane, calling it a "disastrous mistake".   The military claimed air defences were fired in error during an alert which was imposed after Iranian missile struck US targets in Iraq.   Iran denied for days after Wednesday's crash that it brought down the plane, although a top Revolutionary Guards commander on Saturday said that he had told authorities about the "unintentional" missile strike the day it happened.   The Iranian leadership had last faced mass protests in November following the rise in petrol prices.   The death of graduates from top universities migrating to Canada on the Ukrainian flight has struck a nerve with protesters. Many protesters felt their future is ruined in a country facing high unemployment.   The plane crash has further heightened international pressure on Iran after months of friction with the US and tit-for-tat attacks.   Khamenei, silent until now about the crash, said information should be made public, while top officials and the military issued apologies.   A US drone strike killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Suleimani in Iraq on January 3, prompting Tehran to fire at US targets on Wednesday.   Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), in a rare step on Friday, apologised to the nation and accepted full responsibility for the plane crash. In a statement, the military said that the plane flew close to a sensitive Revolutionary Guards site at a time of high alert. (ANI)

In these days of Guardiola-worship, City fans may not have much time for their former manager Mark Hughes. Except Hughes has something on his CV that not even the Spaniard can match: he signed Vincent Kompany. And there is a legitimate argument to suggest that without his drive, his determination, his single-minded insistence on achievement, much of what happened at the club subsequent to his arrival simply might not have occurred. Indeed it could be added that, despite his injury absences in the latter stages of his career at the Etihad, the departure of his influence behind the scenes has weakened City sufficiently to allow Liverpool to dominate the league this season without proper challenge.

They also pored through a 40-page technical document on the specific missile to find out how it fragments when hitting a target to see if they could map the shrapnel holes seen in some photographs of the wreckage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In an era of radical transparency and competing claims of fake news, where we see contemporaneous footage of incidents appear on social media, the old way of investigating incidents – where state intelligence agencies would carry out their investigations in secret and only release high-level summaries – simply wouldn't be seen as credible. OSINT throws light on the process in an attempt to reassure sceptics that the conclusions reached are grounded in fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And as our world becomes more complicated, with competing claims and counterclaims trying to muddy the waters around contentious incidents, OSINT and its practices will become more important. It has done so here, too: while Iran may have been able to shrug off the protestations of politicians without any proof that they were involved, the catalogue of videos and photographs, coupled with obsessive investigation, means that it has been forced to admit that it had a hand in the terrible accident.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “I think in this case in particular, and with MH17, you get statements made by various governments and bodies,” says Higgins, who spoke before Iran had admitted complicity. “We have Iran saying this wasn’t a missile, the US and others say it was a missile. Now open source information can be used to say which is most likely. And generally you find very quickly, if there’s two contradictory claims on that, it comes down to one side or the other when you look at the open-source intelligence.”

Tulsi Gabbard may be stuck in fifth place in most of the polling, but she's clearly not ready to give up the chase. She just wrapped up a bruising three- day marathon in Iowa with a stop in Nevada thrown into the mix. During one appearance with Reuters, she discussed a variety of issues, focusing on the lack of diversity on the debate stage and among the remaining field in general. She made sure to get in some plugs for Kamala Harris and to show her respect for Cory Booker and Andrew Yang as the only people of color left in the running. (Well, they're at least theoretically still in the running.)

Records show that Plough Monday parades have taken place at Tilney All Saints, near King's Lynn, since 1453. Farm workers would perform a song and dance for villagers in return for a donation to themselves or the church. If the donation was not deemed large enough or families did not make a donation, they could expect to see their gardens ploughed up in farming's answer to trick or treat. Pupils from from Tilney All Saints and Anthony Curton primaries recreated the rural tradition for a special lottery-funded history project. Sixty paraded behind a hand plough and tractor from Tilney school to the village church where the plough was blessed, before the children performed traditional 'molly dancing' to historic music from the village collected by the composer Vaughan Williams.

"They weren't getting overtime pay, they weren't getting raises, they're underpaid, they were getting physically abused and then fired for not coming back to work fast enough.

PWRcell systems are not only powerful, they're easy to install, making them an even more attractive choice as a home energy storage solution. When installed by an authorized Generac installer, most PWRcell units can be up and running in just a day. Because PWRcell features modular battery packs, it can often be installed by one person, potentially making installation less expensive.

 "With salt and a little time, you can transform ordinary egg yolks into a savory, 'grateable' substitute for hard cheeses like parmesan. They can quickly add savory depth and complexity to a wide range of foods, from soups and salads to pastas and grilled meats," Souza told Insider.
