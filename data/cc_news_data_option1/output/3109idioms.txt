The Supreme Court Friday sought the Centre's reply on a PIL seeking direction to set up an independent body to regulate and facilitate broadcasting services in the country.
 Besides the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian also issued notices to the News Broadcasters Association, the News Broadcasting Standards Authority of India and the Press Council of India on the PIL filed by Delhi- based lawyer Reepak Kansal.
 The plea said that an independent body with the name of the Broadcast Regulatory Authority of India be set up to check sensational reporting and discourse by TV news channels on critical issues.
 "The petitioner seeks indulgence of this court to protect and safeguard right of life with dignity as guaranteed under the Constitution and which have been assassinated by uncontrolled and unregulated broadcasting electronic channels claimed to be Press'," the PIL said and referred to some news channels' reporting in support of the claim.
 The freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1) of the Constitution doesn't permit anyone to assail the dignity of individuals and political and religious organisation, it said.
 Referring to reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and expression as mentioned in clause (2) of Article 19, it said that they prevent "any person from making any statement that injures the reputation of another".
 The Constitution also prohibits a person from making statements that incite people to commit offense. Under Indian law, the freedom of speech is not an absolute right to express one's thoughts freely, not even the Press, the plea said.
 The Constitution enables the legislature to impose certain restrictions on free speech if it adversely affects "security of the state, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to an offence and sovereignty and integrity of India", the plea said.
 "The airwaves are public property and it is necessary to regulate the use of such airwaves in national and public interest, particularly with a view to ensuring proper dissemination of content and in the widest possible manner," it said.
 Some of these said electronic broadcasting channels claimed to be news channels, have been spreading negativity and enmity among the different communities of the nation, it said.
 Some channels have been targeting one community and instigating one community towards another, it said, adding that "due to said illegal activities in the name of journalism by these self regulated broadcasting channels, India's ranking fell from 138 to 140 out of 180 countries in RSF's 2019 World Press Freedom Index".
 The plea has also sought a direction to the Centre "to control these uncontrolled and unregulated broadcasting electronic channels".

This isn't the first time that Brandon Scheurer has played at Cooley Law School Stadium.
   
 As a star player on some pretty talented Portland St. Patrick baseball teams, he played at the stadium twice as part of the Diamond Classic in his freshman and junior seasons.
   
 Scheurer is now plying his trade at Saginaw Valley State, where his freshman season in the spring was cut short by COVID-19. But before he goes back for what is hopefully his sophomore season, Scheurer is one of many Greater Lansing players who are participating in this summer's Lemonade League at Cooley.
   
 "I'm just excited about the opportunity to get back on the field," Scheurer said. "With everything going on right now, I think the baseball will be good for the Lansing area and be good for all of us just to get back out there on the field and playing again, and ease the distraction of everything that's happening off the field."
   
 Scheurer is just one of many players whose summers were thrown into flux by COVID-19. Four other summer league he had agreed to participate in fell through at one point or another.
   
 Scheurer played in the Lemonade League's first game on July 22, scoring a run.
   
 During his freshman season at Saginaw Valley, Scheurer played in 12 games, batting .214 with nine hits, two doubles, seven RBIs and a .333 on-base percentage.
   
 "I really had to slow the game down and just let the game come to me," Scheurer said. "In the beginning, it's tough as a freshman coming in and playing right away. You start to press and try to go outside of yourself and I think the biggest thing is trying to do the simple things you do right. The first couple of games, it was so fast and sometimes you have to take a step back and say, hey, it's just baseball."
   
 Because his freshman season was cut short, getting in 17 games this summer in the Lemonade League could help push his development forward as a springboard heading into the 2021 season.
   
 "I think, if anything, it'll give us freshmen an advantage where we can come out and be like, we've been through this before, we can prepare better, we know what to expect and that's where I think this league can help us build on that and get better as players next spring."
   
 Scheurer is one of nine Saginaw Valley State players in the league, including DeWitt's Nolan Knauf.
   
 "A lot of these players I either grew up playing against or playing with through high school summer ball," Scheurer said. "It was just cool to get to play together again."
   
 Scheurer is still getting adjusted to life in college baseball after a being named a Division 4 first-team all-state selection in 2019. He helped the Shamrocks win the state title in 2017 and reach the state championship game in 2016.
   
 PSP was ranked No. 1 in the state in D-4 in 2019, but was upset by Fowler in the district finals. Scheurer says he's aware that he's probably from the smallest high school among the Lemonade League players, but he wears it as a badge of honor.
   
 "I'm excited to rep my school and everything," Scheurer said.

The common unit holders probably hope that the management also repurchases some preferred at a discount. So far management has not indicated any intentions to do so. Nonetheless, the debt reduction priority is a welcome priority in the current environment.
 As the coronavirus issue unfolds, another distribution cut to preserve liquidity and repay debt cannot be ruled out. However, if the recovery continues, even in sporadic fashion, the continuing progress should eliminate any threat of another distribution cut. Many companies are being extremely conservative in light of the coronavirus challenges.
 The preservation of balance sheet strength is important as it should allow for a faster recovery once the current challenges fade into the past. That could take a year or more for the challenges to completely fade. This virus has been unpredictable from the beginning. Historically, a recovery would move a lot faster than this. So we are definitely in new territory. That makes Mr. Market nervous and hence Mr. Market will value future forecasts at a lower price- earnings ratio.

IONIA -- For the first time in more than 30 years, there will be a new register of deeds in Ionia County.
   
 Rhonda Lake will become the new register of deeds after defeating Will Wagner in the Tuesday, Aug. 4, Republican primary election.
   
 Lake, who serves as chief deputy register of deeds, received 4,691 votes -- earning 60.8 percent of the vote, according to Ionia County's unofficial election results. Wagner received 3,027 votes (39.2 percent).
   
 There are no Democrats on the ballot for the position in the November general election.
   
 Lake replaces Diane Adams, who is retiring as register of deeds after 32 years in the position. Adams was initially appointed in 1988.
   
 "I was very happy with the outcome," Lake said. "I'd like to thank all my family, friends and everybody who supported me for all of their help and displaying their signs for me and getting the word out.
   
 "I also want to thank my opponent for being honest and having integrity to run a clean race with me. I appreciated that. I'm honored and I"ll be happy to serve the public and the citizens of Ionia County."
   
 The Ionia County Register of Deeds Office records, files, maintains and retrieves documents relating to real property in the county. The office is located in the southwest corner of the main floor at the Ionia County Courthouse.
   
 Lake has served as chief deputy register of deeds in Ionia County for the past 18 years. She has been in charge of the office when Adams was unable to be there.
   
 Lake holds a degree in business administration in business management and administration, which she believes has provided her with the skills to process land records and maintain state compliance.
   
 In a Sentinel-Standard candidate questionnaire, Lake said she intends to continue offering the most up-to-date technology available to provide information to the community.
   
 She said using the automation fund to proceed with projects is a benefit the Register of Deeds Office applies to enhance availability of records and the continued efforts in the Remonumentation Program is essential to land records.
   
 Lake said she's focusing on providing the community with a smooth transition of leadership after Adams retires, completing projects needed to enhance the availability of records and information to the community, and implementing a credit card system that is affordable to the public and can be used to record documents and purchase copies in the Register of Deeds Office.
   
 Lake will start her term after Jan. 1, following Adams' retirement at the end of the year.
   
 "We're happy to have (Adams) here so that we can learn and follow in her first steps to keep everything going smoothly and we'll have a smooth transfer that way," Lake said.

In tempi di crisi la gente si fa parecchie domande. Il più delle volte astruse, purtroppo. Una delle più frequenti è questa. Non si potrebbe risolvere il problema stampando più soldi da distribuire ai cittadini? La risposta non è semplice. Ma la conclusione è purtroppo scontata. Non è possibile né giuridicamente, né economicamente. Giuridicamente perché abbiamo rinunciato a tale sovranità per entrare nell'euro. E quindi dovremmo prima uscirne, ammesso che l'Europa ci consenta di restare ugualmente nell'Unione Europea. Ma, se anche così fosse, il nostro export subirebbe come contromisura forti dazi. Gli stessi che Trump ha messo alla Cina per inginocchiare la sua economia, per esempio.

IMAX China, currently, has a backlog of 271 IMAX system installations as of June 30, 2020. At the company's 1H 2020 results briefing on July 29, 2020, IMAX China acknowledged that the company "would defer any guidance with respect to second half 2020 installations until we have greater visibility" and "we do expect certain delays" for IMAX system installations due to the pandemic. The company only installed three new IMAX systems in 1H 2020, but it added at the recent earnings call that the fourth quarter has "historically representing close to half of our full-year installs." IMAX China also reiterated its view that "in the long term, our existing partners continue to see the value of IMAX to their customers and business" as seen with recent partnerships announced.
 ## Strong Balance Sheet And Favorable Cost Structure To Weather The Storm
 As highlighted in the prior section of this article, it is challenging to determine the exact timeline for the recovery of China's movie industry and IMAX China since this is dependent on multiple factors, most of which are beyond the company's control.
 On the positive side of things, IMAX China has the balance sheet strength and a favorable cost structure, which will enable the company to weather the current storm, even assuming that China's box office takes a longer-than- expected time to return to pre-COVID-19 levels.
 As of June 30, 2020, IMAX China has a net cash balance of $73.8 million, which represents 14% of the stock's market capitalization and 59% of its FY 2019 revenue. In addition, the company also has RMB200 million credit facility which "remains largely un-drawn" according to its comments at the recent 1H 2020 earnings call.
 Also, unlike most other capital intensive movie theater operators which are burdened by content production costs and theater leasing expenses, IMAX China's cost structure is largely variable implying limited operating leverage. This is evidenced by the fact that IMAX China's current monthly cash burn is only $1 million, which is minimal compared to its net cash balance of $73.8 million.

ONEONTA, Ala. (AP) — The entire football team and marching band at a small-town Alabama high school are under quarantine following exposure to the new coronavirus. Oneonta High School coach Phil Phillips told WBMA-TV that a fifth player has tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. It’s the second quarantine of the summer for the team. “I looked my wife in the eyes Monday night before I went to bed and I said, ‘You know I sure hope we didn’t kill anybody’s grandmother today by having a football practice,” said Phillips. “You’re torn because the kids want to play so bad.” The team stopped summer workouts in late July after two coaches and four players tested positive for the coronavirus, which causes mild to moderate symptoms for most people but can be deadly to the elderly or people with other health problems. Band director David Bearden said one of 135 students tested positive in his group, so a quarantine was needed. “For me personally, I know that this is a big thing and it’s hurt a lot of people, but for me personally, I’m looking forward to a time when we can all get back together, the students back together and based on what I’ve seen from my students, they are needing that,” Bearden said. The town of 6,600 people is located about 35 miles (56 kilometers) northeast of Birmingham. The football team is set to resume practice on Aug. 18, just three days before its first game, and Phillips said a delay would be good since it will be tough to get players ready so quickly. “I was hoping for more time, and I really think we’d gain so much and lose nothing,\" he said. Schools around the state are resuming classes with a variety of plans ranging from virtual teaching to traditional classrooms and a mix of the two. ___ The name...

And in 2005, the American Psychological Association recommended the “immediate retirement” of the monikers based on scientific findings that the symbols cause harm to Native children and perpetuate stereotypes that dehumanize Native people.
 “I wasn’t even speaking on behalf of Native Americans at all,” Sheldon said. “I was speaking on behalf of a white person and going, ‘This is a shame that we’re this stupid, still.’ It’s a blight on our character that we’re still treating people in such a manner.”
 Sheldon said the only negative to the experience is that the name was dropped without explanation. For Willie Frank III, a Nisqually Tribal Council member, it was a missed teachable moment.
 For instance, news clippings obtained by NCAI show the r-word is actually a reference to the skin bounty hunters would cut from the body of Native Americans in order to collect payment for the killing.
 “We have multigenerational trauma,” Sharp said. “Until this country does come to terms with it and begin to reconcile and heal, it’s going to be there and exist.”
 The state Legislature did pass the “Since Time Immemorial: Tribal Sovereignty” curriculum in 2015, under which it’s required to learn about Washington’s 29 federally recognized tribes. Another step if La Conner High (Braves) or Cheney High (Blackhawks) keeps their mascots to honor Native people, is learning about the specific tribe ~~.~~ , according to Frank III.

That's because Wiley — who lives in western Massachusetts — is about to join 30 other kids from as far away as Vancouver, Canada, San Jose, Ca. and Washington D.C. in a radical project: they will cook dinner for their families for an entire week.
 The location of summer camp 2020 is each of these kid's own kitchen.
 Welcome to Dinner Club. The menu this week includes Indian butter chicken, Greek salad with falafel, and fish tacos — every dish made entirely from scratch.
 Dinner Club is conceived and taught by Pascal Simon, known to her students as Chef Pascal. The German-born chef has been teaching baking classes for kids out of her home kitchen in Austin, Texas, for a decade. She's had a popular following for years among foodie families and homeschoolers in the city. Simon says that up until a few months ago her classes were mostly focused on "cute stuff" like cookies, Pop Tarts, and French macaroons. A popular offering every summer was called "Cupcake Camp."
 Then came the pandemic.
 Simon had only ever taught in person, a dozen kids packed into her kitchen. Her classes were about hands-on proximity, tactile problem-solving, and community-building. She says the weekend the world shut down she threw herself a pity party. She had never once been on Zoom.
 The Monday after shutdown, Simon began offering online baking classes to any kid who signed up, initially for free. She expected classes to be lightly attended by former students, but within weeks she had up to 45 kids signing up from across North America. The cooking sessions were energetic and chaotic, with Simon picking up numerous new cooking skills on the fly.
 But new skills weren't enough. Although parents appreciated the classes and frequently expressed amazement at what their stuck-at-home kids were accomplishing, these same parents also had a problem.
 Cupcake fatigue.
 "Who needs more cupcakes?" Simon says, her voice rising in exasperation. "Who needs a weeklong of cupcakes?"

The country needs as many as 100,000 contact tracers to fight the pandemic, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Congress in June. We need billions of dollars to fund them, public health leaders pleaded in April.
 But in August, with coronavirus cases increasing in more than half of states, America has neither the staff nor the resources to be able to trace the contacts of every new case — a key step in the COVID-19 public health response.
 Contact tracers call each person who's just tested positive and track down their contacts to inform them of their risk so they can quarantine. They also often connect people with services in order to safely isolate. It takes manpower, time, and organization, but it's proven effective in controlling infectious diseases.
 Despite some enthusiasm about contact tracing early in the pandemic, the U.S. contact tracing workforce continues to fall short of projected need. NPR's latest survey of all 50 states, done in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, finds the national workforce has barely grown since mid June. NPR's previous survey found a total contact tracing workforce of 37,110.

They have the types of jobs that are necessary to keep the country up and running and safe."
 Burakiewicz says federal law requires that employees exposed to hazards, including "a virulent biological disease such as COVID-19," are entitled to hazardous duty pay, "but the government's not paying it to them."

(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Julie Lee, Binghamton University, State University of New York (THE CONVERSATION) People eat for many reasons – pleasure, emotional release, boredom or to connect with others. And then there is eating during a pandemic. Whether you find yourself working from home, in quarantine or transitioning back to an office, chances are good that COVID-19 has impacted how you eat. As a dietitian, I address eating disorders and disordered eating, defined as a behavior that doesn’t quite fit the criteria for an eating disorder diagnosis. I do this by helping students at Binghamton University to eat in ways that support both optimal physical and mental health. In working with students who have food concerns, I teach them that food doesn’t have to be a problem but rather a source of fuel that supports our bodies and minds. And while the pandemic has shaped our lives in unexpected ways, there are a few simple strategies to help you strike a nutritional balance no matter your situation. 1. Eat like clockwork Our bodies love routine and tend to perform best with repetition. This is especially true of eating. Without the structure of a regular work or school day, or when your “desk” is within arm’s length of your fridge, it can be easier to eat erratically. Try to eat at around the same time each day. This can help regulate hunger and fullness cues, leading to more mindful decisions about what and when to eat. Aim to eat a balanced meal every three to four hours. Add a snack when meals are more than five hours apart. Include at least three food groups for a meal and two for a snack, and try to include protein whenever you eat. Sticking to a regular schedule and...

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey’s president has called a maritime deal between Greece and Egypt “worthless,” saying Turkey will resume oil and gas exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean. Egypt and Greece on Thursday signed a maritime deal that sets the sea boundary between the two countries and demarcates an exclusive economic zone for oil and gas drilling rights. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking after Friday prayers in the recently reconverted Hagia Sophia mosque, said the deal was a response to Turkey’s maritime agreement with Libya’s Tripoli-based government last year and vowed to continue it. That deal spiked tensions in the East Mediterranean region and was dismissed by Egypt, Cyprus and Greece as an infringement on their economic rights in the oil-rich sea. Erdogan also said Turkey had paused research in disputed waters with Greece after a request from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “I told (Merkel) we’ll pause drilling for three to four weeks if you trust Greece and the others … but I don’t trust them and you will see,” Erdogan said. But that appears to have ended with the deal between Greece and Egypt. “We have immediately resumed exploration activities,” Erdogan said and appointed Turkish research vessel Barbaros Hayreddin, which is sailing off the western coast of Cyprus. Turkey has accused Greece of trying to exclude it from the benefits of oil and gas finds in the Aegean Sea and Eastern Mediterranean, arguing that sea boundaries for commercial exploitation should be divided between the Greek and Turkish mainlands and not include the Greek islands on an equal basis. Athens counters that Turkey’s position is a violation of international law.
