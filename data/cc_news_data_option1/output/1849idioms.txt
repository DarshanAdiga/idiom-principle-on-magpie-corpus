Finally, it is necessary to move forward in structuring an agenda to increase productivity and reform the State, so that, in the end of the crisis, the growth of the economy is as large as possible and the expansion of public spending is controlled, contributing to a trajectory sustainable public debt. This is a central part of the fiscal cost financing agenda for the crisis. Perhaps it is not yet time to move forward in debating this agenda in the Legislature, but it is important that it is as mature as possible for when this debate starts.

Abu Dhabi: Adnoc Distribution, the UAE’s largest fuel and convenience retailer, reported revenues of Dh4.93 billion for the first three months, an increase 3.6 per cent from last year. Profits were down by a sizeable 30.9 per cent to Dh400 million, and attributed to the drop in business from COVID-19 and which led to lower total fuel sales. There was also a decline in non-fuel and commercial business profitability. But the overall financial position remains solid, with liquidity at Dh8 billion in the form of Dh5.2 billion in cash and Dh2.8 billion in unutilised credit facility.

LAPLACE, La. (AP) " Authorities in Louisiana said they are looking for a man who escaped after allegedly kidnapping a 73-year-old woman and twice leading authorities in a car chase.
 St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff Mike Tregre told The Times-Picayune / New Orleans Advocate that Aaron Dun, 33, escaped for the second time Friday after crashing a stolen vehicle during a car pursuit with Louisiana State Police in New Orleans.
 'Two separate pursuits, two separate cars wrecked and he's still on the run,' Tregre said. Deputies are asking the public's help in finding Dun, who is registered as a sex offender with the Birmingham Police Department in Alabama.
 State Police in Louisiana first came across Dun on Tuesday while he was allegedly driving a stolen vehicle from Alabama in LaPlace, Tregre said Sunday in a Facebook post. According to Tregre, the driver of the car refused requests to pull over and led deputies in a car chase before he crashed the car and escaped on foot.
 That same day, police officers got a call that a 73-year-old woman was kidnapped from her home in LaPlace. When officers arrived at the house, they learned the woman was taken at knifepoint by a man while her 93-year-old mother and a seven-year-old child were present in the home.
 Tregre said the man forced the woman into her car and released her after they got to a nearby hotel. He drove away with the car but did not injure the woman, Tregre added.
 Investigators were then able to connect the car chase and the kidnapping to Dun, Tregre said.
 Dun has outstanding arrest warrants in both Louisiana and Alabama.

Others have worked behind the scenes reviewing data and creating models to analyze disease progression and resource needs. As a retired professor who taught social policy, I’ve been impressed by their effective and helpful work.

An IDF soldier was killed after a large rock was thrown at his head while troops were carrying out arrests in the Palestinian town of Ya'bad in the northern West Bank on Tuesday morning.
 The soldier was identified as 21-year-old Staff Sergeant Amit Ben Yigal, from Ramat Gan.
 Troops from the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion had been carrying out a series of arrests in the village and had detained four wanted Palestinians-- two suspected of involvement in a terrorist organization, and two suspected of throwing stones.
 At around 4.30 AM, after completing the arrests, troops began to leave the village when a group of 10 locals began throwing stones towards the troops who were making their way out of the village by foot.
 "The rock hit the soldier directly in the head," IDF Spokesperson Brig.-Gen. Hidai Zilberman told reporters. "The soldier was wearing a helmet. But it hit him at an angle."
 According to Zilberman, the rock was smaller than half a meter and was thrown from the roof of one of the homes on the outskirt of the village.
 As troops were unable to identify who threw the stone, soldiers did not open fire in return.
 Ben Yigal received treatment from medics at the scene before being evacuated to Haifa's Rambam Medical Center's intensive care unit by helicopter, where he succumbed to his wounds. He is the first IDF soldier killed in the past year.
 The military has opened a preliminary investigation and troops are currently in the village searching for the Palestinians who threw the stone towards the soldier.
 The family has been notified and he has been posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant first class.
 Ben Yigal's father Baruch, in an interview with Reshet Bet, said that he was the only son and had insisted on serving in Golani despite the fact that only children do not have to serve in combat units in the military.
 Baruch Ben Yigal told the radio station that his son asked to join a combat unit after visiting death camps in Poland and "I said to him, Amit you are my only son, you have to understand what this means. He responded that we have no other country and I went with him to Tel Hashomer to sign and I told him how proud I was of him."
 "I signed the form...I signed the form for my only son. He wanted Sayeret Golani...what can I tell you? They came at 6.30 in the morning, the two officers, and I thought they made a mistake. But they told me that he had been injured...they told me to sit down and I couldn't sit down. I wanted to know what happened," he said.
 "He was my only son. I have nothing else, he was my whole world...I spoke with him every day on Zoom and Whatsapp...Such a tragedy befell me tonight, I don't know how to start to comprehend it. I can't even cry...I don't know how to keep going," he said. "It's a tragedy, a tragedy…"
 In a post on Facebook that he wrote in honor of Daniel Pomerantz, a Golani fighter killed during Operation Protective Edge, Amit Ben Yigal wrote about his pride to serve in the unit and the meaning behind
 "To be Golanchik is to see the landscape from the bus window, and to know that you marched there too...It's to curse the moment you are living in, and in the same breath remember why you are here. To be a Golanchik is to sit on gear while looking at each other's eyes and just laugh because you are both going through the same thing. It's a deep friendship...to look at the soldiers with the red berets when you have red eyes, To be Golanichik is not to look back, because you always have a whole country behind you," he wrote.
 "To be a Golanchik is to hear Hatikva and get chills in every part of your body...I Amit Ben Yigal am proud to be a Golanchik. Proud to take part in a long-standing tradition like Golani.  Proud to be the continuation of many drafts before and to be a role model to those after.
 "For the past two years, I mark Memorial Day in a different uniform from civilians.  This time I'm in the soldier's uniform with the beret and representing something. And suddenly the words have meaning, acts have consequences," he continued. "I would like to address each person who reads this post individually: Take a moment of silence put on a  calm song that you love, close your eyes, concentrate on one person out of every 23,741 who fell. One. Close your eyes look at that one person in front of you and let the emotions take you wherever it takes you."
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent his condolences to the family and "like what has happened in all cases in recent years, Israel's long arm will find the terrorist."
 Defense Minister Naftali Bennett promised that the IDF would catch the terrorists responsible for Ben Ygal's death and also extended his condolences to the family.
 "Staff Sergeant Amit Ben Yigal fell tonight while defending Israel's security. The IDF and the security forces will find the lowly terrorists responsible for this, and we will settle accounts with them," he said.
 President Reuven Rivlin also sent his condolences to the Ben Yigal family, saying that "we are heartbroken in the face of the bright youth who was cut down in his prime. I am confident that our forces will find the despicable terrorists and bring them to justice."
 Two years ago Sergeant Ronen Lubarsky from the elite Duvdevan unit was killed after he was hit in the head by a large marble slab thrown from the roof of a nearby building by Islam Yusuf Abu Hamid, a 32 year-old resident of the Am'ari refugee camp in Ramallah. Hamid was convicted of murder last April.

Eligible workers currently on a waiting list for emergency childcare in Stratford may not need to wait much longer.
 A plan to make 20 new spaces available at the YMCA Early Learning and Development Centre passed a hurdle Monday afternoon when city councillors unanimously approved an agreement with the Stratford-Perth Family YMCA.
 Kim McElroy, the city’s director of social services, told councillors that eight children are currently on the waiting list.
 According to her report, the local YMCA has submitted a request for approval from Huron Perth public health. An application will also move forward to the Ministry of Education, which is still providing funding for childcare spaces, a process McElroy said earlier Monday she hopes will be complete by early next week.
 Emergency childcare providers are running under strict health and safety guidelines, and must have plans in place in case a child, parent or staff member is exposed to COVID-19.
 Two other childcare sites up and running in Perth County have already completed this process. The Anne Hathaway Day Care Centre in Stratford and the North Perth-Spinrite Child and Family Centre in North Perth both received approval to offer emergency childcare at the end of April.
