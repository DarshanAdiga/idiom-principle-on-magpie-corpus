But despite the volume of information an e-commerce WMS handles, both in set-up and use, implementation is far from complex. With rapid turnaround remote solutions, warehouse management software can be deployed without having to physically visit a site to get up and running. If warehouse facilities are available, a logistics platform can be rolled out in a matter of weeks, not months.

LOS ANGELES (January 25, 2017) - WRAL, one of the country's most respected and innovative television stations, has selected Xytech MediaPulse to manage the station's production and news activities. MediaPulse plays an important role behind the scenes at WRAL, helping to schedule reporters, photographers, anchors, engineers, creative services personnel and their activities, as well as equipment and trucks. MediaPulse also supports scheduling of master control for the station.
 WRAL is the flagship of the Capitol Broadcasting Corporation and a recognized trailblazer in the broadcast industry. In 1996, the FCC awarded WRAL the first experimental HD television license in the United States, and the following year it was the first in the U.S. to broadcast a live sports program and newscast in high definition. In 2000, WRAL became the first TV station in the world to produce and air an all-HD broadcast, including the graphics, live shots and news. Last year the station switched to NBC from its long-standing affiliation with CBS.
 WRAL's focus on innovation continues with the selection of MediaPulse to optimize efficiency and transparency, and to automate and analyze its operational activities along with a news operations staff of 120. WRAL covers major events including tournaments and elections where numerous personnel and a large pool of equipment need to be planned, organized, scheduled and tracked over multiple days. All those operations run on MediaPulse. Additionally, WRAL Creative Services production work and the station's engineering staff are better scheduled and tracked through MediaPulse.
 Pete Sockett, WRAL director of engineering and operations, said, "WRAL Raleigh, alongside two sister stations in the Capitol Broadcasting family, is now capable of racking daily assignments of newsroom personnel, trucks and equipment for story coverage with MediaPulse. We are planning on better management and tracking of resources with reduced resource conflicts, improved maintenance scheduling, enhanced staff communications and, in the end, an overall ability to better analyze how the station can operate most efficiently, productively and profitably."
 Xytech is the industry leader in facility management software for the broadcast, production, media services and video transmission industries. Its products are currently facilitating operations in some of the world's most dynamic companies and leading broadcast environments, such as ABC, Lifetime, Scripps, Sinclair Broadcasting, Univision, CBS Television City, WGBH, RDS, TV Globo and Nebraska Educational Television.
 MediaPulse offers broadcasters and production facilities the ability to more efficiently track their resources and costs in real time. The platform provides WRAL and other stations with better management and staff decision- making by making important information available. MediaPulse Sky enables anytime-anyplace browser interface, and the MediaPulse iOS app facilitates efficient time entry and schedule access via mobile devices.
 Greg Dolan, COO of Xytech, noted, "WRAL is one of the most successful and technically progressive local television stations in the country, pioneering important technological advancements while broadcasting local news in a major regional market. They continue to lead the way for local news stations and for all stations covering national events. Their choice of MediaPulse to power their operations is something we are terrifically proud of."
 Sockett concluded, "WRAL has a history of innovation and we've consistently been first in broadcast technology trends. As a busy station in a busy market, we must perform and analyze our operations in the most efficient way possible and that includes getting reporters and equipment to sites in a timely, effective manner. The reality of local broadcasting demands extreme functionality. The strength of MediaPulse in WRAL's operations is being demonstrated to us daily and we're delighted to work with the great team there to fully realize the benefits of this powerful platform."

Comcast is going to carry the new Olympic Channel being created by NBCUniversal.
 But when NBCU, the International Olympic Committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee announced plans to launch the linear cable network, the only distributor officially on board was DirecTV.
 Comcast, NBCU’s parent company, is spending billions on Olympic broadcast rights through 2032. Comcast also earlier this month agreed to be an official partner of the U.S. Olympic committee through 2020.
 And Comcast threw itself into this year’s Rio games, creating a huge Olympic section on its X1 operating system, giving subscribers access to hours of competition live and on demand.
 But when it acquired NBCU, Comcast agreed to provide access to independent programmers.
 So when Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics, was asked about how much carriage the new Olympic channel has and whether it will be carried by Comcast, this is what he said.
 “NBCUniversal completed a distribution agreement with DirecTV-AT&T over the summer which included the Olympic Channel. There is currently a commitment to carry the Olympic Channel… We are in a cycle in which we are negotiating with distributors; the Olympic Channel will be in that conversation. We are optimistic that distributors will embrace this opportunity and content and the opportunity to bring the content to their audiences as we described earlier.”
 “We have not begun to discuss the distribution of the Olympic Channel with Comcast because those negotiations have not naturally begun. NBC is not currently in negotiations with Comcast for the distribution of the NBCUniversal bundle. When that begins, the Olympic Channel will certainly be part of that discussion,” Zenkel said.
 In a follow up question, Zenkel was asked if NBCU’s deal with Comcast doesn’t expire before the Olympic Channel is scheduled to launch, will NBCU wait till then to be in negotiations.
 “Of course not,” Zenkel replied. “We will approach them sometime in the future. Again, the natural term of the Comcast deal, which I don't have handy because I'm not part of the distribution team here, but when that term does come up, we will do it. If it's after the launch of the channel, we will begin the conversations with Comcast in advance of that. But we have not started that yet.”
 The new channel does not have the rights to the Olympic games, which will be carried on NBC’s own channels. Zenkel couldn’t say what the channel will be showing those weeks.
 “We’re still about 14 months out, not that we aren't spending a lot of time working on our program plans for PyeongChang. But those plans are in development,” he said.

India's cricket board will not push for the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia to be postponed but would consider staging the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the October/November slot if it becomes available, a senior BCCI official has told Reuters.This year's IPL, which is worth almost USD 530 million to the BCCI, has been indefinitely postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic while the World Cup, which is scheduled to begin on Oct. 18, is also in jeopardy.Reports in Australian media have suggested India's influential board may look to push for the World Cup to be postponed to open up a winYouTube Mediadow for the IPL.World Cup contingency plans are on the agenda at next week's International Cricket Council (ICC) board meeting but BCCI treasurer Arun Singh Dhumal said India would not be recommending it be pushed back.&quot;Why should the BCCI suggest postponing the Twenty20 World Cup?&quot; Dhumal told Reuters by telephone.&quot;We'll discuss it in the meeting and whatever is appropriate, (the ICC) will take a call.&quot;If the Australia government announces that the tournament will happen and Cricket Australia is confident they can handle it, it will be their call. BCCI would not suggest anything.&quot;While Australia has seen new infections of the novel coronavirus slow to a trickle and is gradually easing travel curbs and social distancing restrictions, hosting a 16-team World Cup would be a Herculean task for Cricket Australia.Dhumal questioned whether the tournament should go ahead if it had to be played without spectators and said the Australian government would play a key role in any decision.&quot;It all depends on what the Australian government says on this - whether they'd allow so may teams to come and play the tournament,&quot; he added.&quot;Will it make sense to play games without spectators? Will it make sense for CA to stage such a tournament like that? It's their call.&quot;Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts was guarded about the prospects of staging the tournament as scheduled on Friday.&quot;We don't have clarity on that one, yet. But as the situation continues to improve, you never know what might be possible,&quot; he said.&quot;It's ultimately a decision for the ICC.&quot;The ICC has said it was unlikely to make a final call on the fate of the World Cup until August but some boards are in the process of making contingency plans in the event of a postponement.While the BCCI recognised an open October-November window would suit the IPL, Dhumal said there was no point in making plans until there was some certainty about the World Cup.&quot;If we have the window available, and depending on what all can be organised, we'll decide accordingly,&quot; he added. &quot;We can't presume that it's not happening and go on planning.&quot;Also, catch all the latest updates and trends on the novel coronavirus with CNBCTV18's blog.

Locked down for the better part of two months, we have learnt to appreciate home-cooked food. Many are discovering their love for cooking, and many others are learning to cook for survival. Either way Indians seemed to have settled into eating at home, at least for now.While it is tough to beat the experience of dining out and treating yourself to a scrumptious meal, a majority of Indians surveyed by LocalCircles, a community social platform,&amp;nbsp;said they would not visit their favourite restaurant in their city for the next 30 days, even if it was open.74 percent of the survey's 24,000 respondents said they would avoid dining out, out of the fear of contracting the virus, not wanting to spending on the indulgence of restaurant food.The survey, conducted across 232 Indian districts, also revealed that 25 percent people are likely to order food from food delivery apps in the next 30 days, with the highest number of respondents going easy with their restaurant orders, limiting them to 1-2 deliveries ( 16 percent ). Fewer than 3 percent of them said they'll order over four times.65 percent said they will not order restaurant food for delivery, while 10 percent respondents were unsure of what they would do.The F&amp;amp;B industry has seen zero dine-in business since the start of the lockdown. Among the government's relaxations under Lockdown 4.0, restaurants have continued to be permitted to operate delivery services, while dine-in services have to remain shut.Food delivery start-ups including Zomato and Swiggy have seen orders drop over 70 percent since late March. Both start-ups have ventured into non-core businesses such as delivery of essential items to bridge the shortfall in revenue to some extent.Zomato and Swiggy have also started alcohol delivery services in some part of the country. While Zomato laid off 600 employees, Swiggy let go of 1,100, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.According to the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India, almost 70 percent hotels and restaurants in India might close down in the next 30 to 45 days due to the strict government regulations and reduced consumer interest.

Li told the annual session of the largely ceremonial National People's Congress that the battle against the new coronavirus, which has infected at least 5.1 million people worldwide according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, “has not yet come to an end.”
 The lawmakers were meeting under strict health precautions in Beijing after the gathering was postponed for nearly two months. China is still striving to snuff out outbreaks. It reported four new confirmed virus cases on Friday and no new deaths.
 Japan’s central bank on Friday also pledged more support for its pandemic- stricken economy. At an emergency meeting, the Bank of Japan said it would provide $280 billion in zero-interest, unsecured loans to banks for financing small and medium-size businesses battling economic hardships brought on by the pandemic.
 Japan's economy was already sliding into recession in late 2019, before the pandemic struck, devastating economies nearly everywhere as consumers were ordered to stay home and businesses to stay closed in many hard-hit areas. The impact on Japan's jobless rate remains unclear, since the country did not impose hard lockdowns and many people are still commuting to work.
 European countries also have seen heavy job losses, but robust government safety-net programs in places like Germany and France are subsidizing the wages of millions of workers and keeping them on the payroll.
 Private sector analysts say as many as 30% of China’s 442 million urban workers — or as many as 130 million people — have lost jobs at least temporarily. They say as many as 25 million jobs were lost perhaps for good this year.
 “It seems employers have stopped hiring,” said Zhang Jijun, a migrant laborer who came to Beijing from the western province of Shanxi. “All the available jobs are not good and nobody wants to go.”
 In the U.S., even as states from coast to coast gradually began reopening their economies and letting people go back to work, more than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment last week, the Labor Department said.
 The latest figures do not mean all 38.6 million people who have filed for unemployment are still out of work. Some have been called back, and others have landed new jobs. But the vast majority are still unemployed and while the number of weekly applications has slowed for seven straight weeks the numbers are 10 times higher than normal.

BOYLSTON - Memorial Day won't feature the usual parade, but a parade of antique cars is being planned through town.
 Selectmen Chairman James Wood said it would be "just something to lift everybody's spirits."
 The parade on Monday, May 25, will kick off from The Other Place Pub and follow many of the bus routes, Wood said.
 "It will be kind of a neat thing, but not like the Memorial Day parade we usually have," Wood said, noting it would run about two hours.
 Information is posted on the town website detailing the parade route. Updates will be provided on the Boylston Neighbors Facebook page as the parade progresses to alert people to when it will be approaching their neighborhood.
 The parade is being organized by Rudy Lambrick.
 Selectmen Monday night discussed a couple resident concerns that led to debate over repercussions from allowing a "favor" for one leading to requests from many.
 The board opted not to take any action on a resident's request for a "no parking" sign near the end of Scar Hill Road to limit parking by those using the DCR gate.
 But selectmen and town officials had concerns that it could lead to requests from others. Selectman James Underwood said the town did not restrict paring on other roads.
 "It is a public road. We don't have 'no parking' on other public roads. Why would we start now?" Underwood asked.
 And the issue could resolve itself, Highway Superintendent Steve Mero said, noting there were more people because of the pandemic and, after the fishing opening rush died down, there would be fewer cars.
 He also said that when the owners purchased the land, they had DCR move the gate down the hill because they wanted more frontage, but they later complained about littering so the DCR agreed to move it back to the top if the hill. Mero said he had no issue with that, but the new issue then arose.
 Mero noted there was no parking allowed on the cemetery side of the road.
 "I think you guys are going down a slippery slope here," resident Gerry Quam said, in granting any parking restriction, noting a neighbor that has pool parties and visitors park in front of his house. He said if selectmen granted it, they could expect other requests.
 Selectman Matt Mecum said he would be in favor of a temporary sign.
 And Mero said he'd consider a sawhorse, but Underwood said people would then put their own sawhorses out.
 "It definitely could open a can of worms," Mero said.
 "This particular situation is at the reservoir and the DCR, but it is temporary and will die off soon," Wood said. Not getting a sense selectmen felt strongly, he added, "for now, let's skip it."
 Town Administrator April Steward suggested Mero could keep an eye on it and, in two weeks, selectmen can re-evaluate the request.
 Another request came from Quam, a resident of Smallwood Circle. He asked that the town provide a truck to pick up leaves residents had cleared from the island that divides the lanes of the road to the subdivision.
 But town officials had concerns about that leading to other requests for the town to pick up people's leaves.
 Quam said it was the only island, except for another street with a smaller one.
 But the response was that the town would prefer to pave it over, making it easier to maintain the road and plow snow.
 Underwood said it was a nice island, but added "when a developer puts an island in, it's more a pain because of plowing. It's better to have that be a paved street with no islands."
 "I'm not arguing that point," Quam said, adding he was not asking the town to maintain the island, but for a truck "to help us transport leaves two miles to the town dump. I don't think it's an unreasonable request and was a little upset with got the response I got.
 "I was asking for a favor," Quam said.
 Mero said if the board wanted to consider it, "why don't we drive around and have residents dump leaves in our truck?"
 "If I was really pressed to maintain or get rid of it, the town would choose to pave it," Mecum said.
 "That's what I'm thinking," Wood said. "Get rid of the island and pave it. It's easier for plowing in the winter."
 "I knew you guys would go there," Quam said. "I think you'd have a lot of opposition. I don't think we'd be in favor of that. I guess it's better for the town to pave the street as opposed to lifting a finger for a half hour once a year to transport leaves."
 "I don't think that's fair," Steward said. "I grew up in this town," adding that having lived in a city, "I can't think of one island in the right of way in a city that the city maintains," noting private groups such as garden clubs or neighborhood groups take care of and maintain islands.
 "I don't think it's fair to come after the highway superintendent. If he was to pick up leaves, the requests would come in and he would be inundated," Steward said, adding the town would have to add funds into the budget and that would impact taxes.
 "I think we're arguing a fine line," Quam said. "It was a simple request for a truck to help us transport some leaves. I think I know where you guys stand."

 • Although town hall and public buildings may not open until phase two in several weeks, work will include new protective installations and procedures, Steward said. That could include temperature checks of employees and visitors.
 Steward said she would recommend that the Town Hall not to open to the public until the facilities technician is able to install the proper protective barriers in town offices. Most of the departments have been able to weigh in if they would prefer a window in the door of their office or if they would prefer safety glass to be installed on their counter tops, she said. The new installation should be done within the next several weeks, after the facilities manager completes work at the police station.
 Steward said she is also creating criteria for safety measures for the town meeting and election; those should be set by June 1, with the board to review those in June.
 • The board reviewed the articles for the June 22 annual meeting and approved the warrant.

“We were approached by Cornhusker State Industries” a private company that employs Nebraska Department of Corrections inmates in a variety of industries, to provide product for its start-up of sanitizer production.
 “So, we made that donation,” after which “word got out” about Green Plains. Subsequent donations to similar efforts at the University of Nebraska and the Iowa prison system followed.
 Those donations brought the plant very much into the commercial world of sanitizer production and Stuhr’s phone began to ring and ring and ring. “It kind of snowballed from there all over the country,” he said.
 It was not uncommon at that time for Stuhr to miss as many as three incoming calls while talking with a single potential customer.
 “There is still a lot of interest,” he said, proven by the fact that, today, alcohol is shipped to 20 states and Canada by rail, tanker trucks and aboard traditional semis in containers secured to pallets.
 Even with all those customers now on board, “I bet I average 15-20 sample requests a week” from potential new customers.
 The economic benefits for staff at the plant are obvious. They go to work every day, secure in their jobs, while millions are unemployed and desperate through no fault of their own.
 It goes much further than that, however.
 The dozens of mostly independent owner-driver truckers who deliver corn to the plant in belly dump semis or take the alcohol away in tankers have all the work they can handle, too.
 Amazingly, Stuhr said only 65 hours lie between when the corn comes in the gate and the distilled product goes back out.
 On the average day employees grind 55,000 to 60,000 bushels of corn at the rate of 1,000 bushels per truck.
 What happens when the virus finally releases its stranglehold on the world?
 Stuhr has every reason to believe the news will continue to be good for the local folks at Green Plains.
 “This (sanitizer demand) is opening up some domestic opportunities now” in other industries,” he said. “We’ve got our name out. My hope is this opens up some domestic business … a niche … for us” that will ripple far into the future.

Most of the vaccines in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize the spiky protein that studs the new coronavirus' outer surface, so it's primed to attack if the real infection comes along.

NASHVILLE — Vanderbilt has removed the interim title, making Candice Storey Lee the first woman to become an athletic director in the Southeastern Conference.
 With Vanderbilt's announcement Wednesday, Lee now is among only five women and the second black woman in charge of a Power Five program. Daniel Diermeier, who takes over as Vanderbilt's chancellor on July 1, said Lee is the "living embodiment" of the university's values and aspirations.
 "Candice is perfectly positioned to lead our athletics program to new heights of success on and off the field of play," Diermeier said. "She has the drive, creativity, and perseverance to help elevate our student-athletes, and the entire Vanderbilt Athletics program.
 The 41-year-old Lee, a former Commodores basketball captain, was named interim athletic director Feb. 4 when Malcolm Turner resigned after one year on the job for the former NBA G League president. That made Lee the first woman to run athletics at Vanderbilt, and she said she was incredibly honored and could not be in this position without the support of Vanderbilt's leadership, coaches, staff and fans.
 "There are challenges ahead and much uncertainty about what college athletics can and should look like during a pandemic, but I firmly believe that anything is possible if we all work together," Lee said.
 Tennessee's Joan Cronan was the only other woman to have been at least an interim AD at an SEC school, the conference said. She was the interim for the Volunteers for approximately three months in 2011. Cronan and Bev Lewis at Arkansas both were in charge of women's departments when both schools had separate athletics departments.
 Lee joins Carla Williams at Virginia as the only black women athletic directors at a Power Five school, with Sandy Barbour at Penn State, Jennifer Cohen at Washington and Heather Lyke at Pittsburgh the other women ADs.
 As a four-year letter winner for Vanderbilt's women's basketball team, Lee graduated with a degree in human and organizational development in 2000. She also received her master's degree in counseling from Vanderbilt in 2002, and in 2012, Lee earned her doctorate from Vanderbilt in higher education administration.
 She became Vanderbilt's senior woman administrator in the athletics department in 2004 and deputy athletic director in 2016. In that role, Lee ran the day- to-day operations and also oversaw both football and women's basketball for the Commodores.
 Lee is a former member of the NCAA women's basketball rules committee, former chair of the NCAA Division I women's lacrosse committee and a former chair of the SEC Senior Woman Administrators. Lee also is on the board of the directors for the YWCA of Middle Tennessee and on the SEC Executive Committee.
 Susan R. Wente, Vanderbilt's interim chancellor and provost, said Lee hit the ground running after being appointed interim athletic director earlier this year.
 "We will look back and see this decision as a major turning point for Vanderbilt athletics, and our entire university," Wente said.

Kelch wishes the NRD would add more RV pads at Anderson Recreation Area (Recharge Lake), as it is his favorite place to camp and he notices that it’s often full. “This campground is awesome,” he said. “We come here whenever we can.” When the Kelches are camping, they typically have friends join them for cookouts in the evening. The coronavirus has put a crimp in that plan this year. “It’s probably not a good idea right now,” Kelch admits.
 Another of the first campers through the gates is towed by Steve Folts. Today is the maiden voyage for his new Trail Runner. “I just bought it in February, but after the COVID thing, we haven’t been able to take it out,” he said.
 Folts and his wife, Lynn, live and farm in Benedict, 10 miles down the road from York. “This is just a short trip to try it out,” he said. “We wanted to make sure everything works before we took it further.” The couple plans to visit state parks this summer. Their plans for the long weekend in York involve fishing and relaxing with their daughter.
 Mary Seggerman and her husband Dave from Fairmont are regular visitors to Anderson Recreation Area campgrounds. Dave is a school teacher. This camping trip is a much needed respite after a long and challenging semester. “We love camping and we were anxiously awaiting the opening here,” said Mary, who arrived at 7 a.m. to make sure they got a spot. She was number nine in line. “It was crazy busy,” she said.
 The Seggermans and their dog Calleigh, a large, white terrier mix, like to walk the trails around the recreation area when they visit.Their other favorite activity? “Just chilling out by the lake,” said Mary with a shrug.

LPGA players will be free to decide whether or not they want to use a caddie when the tour gets up and running amid the coronavirus pandemic. Players are being given the option of carrying their own golf bags for the remainder of the 2020 season as part of the LPGA Tour's new safety guidelines, the Golf Channel reported on Thursday. The tour is scheduled to restart on July 23 at the Marathon Classic in Sylvania, Ohio. Many of the players don't want to commit to the same caddie for the entire season so individual tournaments often provide local ones.
 "This temporary option is meant primarily to avoid the local caddie situation where a player may have health concerns working with someone who they don't know," said tour spokesperson Kelly Schultz.
 "We fully expect the overwhelming number of players to be using caddies and are encouraging them to do so.
 "Caddies are a critical part of LPGA tournaments and competitions and we will resume our mandatory policy in 2021."
 Schultz insisted it would be a temporary move and not a way of phasing out caddies long term.
 "Nothing could be further from the truth," she said.
 The LPGA recently moved back its scheduled return from July 15 when it cancelled the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational.
 LPGA commissioner Mike Whan has said additional cancellations are still possible.

He had resisted retirement for a long time, getting better not worse as he got older, but he was finally due to call it a day at the end of this season whenever that is. Instead, he has to stop now, at a time when stadiums stand silent. He has played 780 games, scored 285 goals and not won a major trophy, although the 2015 Spanish Super Cup – when he scored a hat-trick against Barcelona as the club won its first title of any kind in 30 years – certainly felt like one on the streets of Bilbao.

Penso, per esempio, ai settori dell'abbigliamento e della ristorazione».«L'impegno del governo per garantire la salvaguardia dei posti di lavoro è massimo», ha assicurato Conte spiegando che questo si realizza "attraverso il sostegno al reddito di milioni di lavoratori dipendenti, ai quali è stata assicurata la cassa integrazione, e il blocco dei licenziamenti».Il presidente del Consiglio ha ribadito che "grazie al decreto Rilancio semplificheremo le procedure per l'erogazione della cig in deroga e consentiremo all'Inps di anticipare il 40 per cento delle somme spettanti al lavoratore entro due settimane dalla presentazione della domanda. In più - ha aggiunto - abbiamo allargato la platea dei lavoratori a cui sarà riconosciuta una indennità per far fronte all'emergenza, come colf e badanti".

Locked down for the better part of two months, we have learnt to appreciate home-cooked food. Many are discovering their love for cooking, and many others are learning to cook for survival. Either way Indians seemed to have settled into eating at home, at least for now.
 While it is tough to beat the experience of dining out and treating yourself to a scrumptious meal, a majority of Indians surveyed by LocalCircles, a community social platform, said they would not visit their favourite restaurant in their city for the next 30 days, even if it was open.
 74 percent of the survey's 24,000 respondents said they would avoid dining out, out of the fear of contracting the virus, not wanting to spending on the indulgence of restaurant food.
 The survey, conducted across 232 Indian districts, also revealed that 25 percent people are likely to order food from food delivery apps in the next 30 days, with the highest number of respondents going easy with their restaurant orders, limiting them to 1-2 deliveries ( 16 percent ). Fewer than 3 percent of them said they'll order over four times.
 65 percent said they will not order restaurant food for delivery, while 10 percent respondents were unsure of what they would do.
 The F&B industry has seen zero dine-in business since the start of the lockdown. Among the government's relaxations under Lockdown 4.0, restaurants have continued to be permitted to operate delivery services, while dine-in services have to remain shut.
 Food delivery start-ups including Zomato and Swiggy have seen orders drop over 70 percent since late March. Both start-ups have ventured into non-core businesses such as delivery of essential items to bridge the shortfall in revenue to some extent.
 Zomato and Swiggy have also started alcohol delivery services in some part of the country. While Zomato laid off 600 employees, Swiggy let go of 1,100, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
 According to the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India, almost 70 percent hotels and restaurants in India might close down in the next 30 to 45 days due to the strict government regulations and reduced consumer interest.

Anna Kendrick presentó “Love Life”, una serie que se estrenará en la plataforma HBO Max el 27 de mayo y que repasa las diferentes aventuras y relaciones sentimentales de una joven en Nueva York. Kendrick, muy conocida por la saga “Pitch Perfect” y nominada al Oscar a la mejor actriz de reparto por “Up in the Air” (2009), estrenó con “Love Life” su primer gran papel televisivo a través de una “premiere” virtual, una idea que se está extendiendo en Hollywood estas semanas para desvelar grandes lanzamientos audiovisuales sin romper el confinamiento por el coronavirus. En estas “premieres” virtuales, un grupo de periodistas especializados recibe una invitación para poder ver la película o varios episodios de la serie en cuestión desde su portátil, y después tiene lugar una pequeña fiesta digital con sorpresas y atracciones relacionadas con el estreno. Antes de la emisión de los dos primeros episodios de “Love Life”, Kendrick, en un mensaje de video, dijo que confía en que la gente pueda disfrutar de esta serie incluso durante “estos tiempos difíciles”. La actriz también subrayó que esta serie gira en torno a “la resiliencia personal”, las “conexiones humanas” y “cómo las personas a las que amamos dan forma a nuestra vida”. “Love Life” retrata la biografía romántica de una joven en Nueva York a través de los diferentes enamoramientos, rupturas, ilusiones y desencantos sentimentales por los que pasa. Cada capítulo muestra una relación o romance con el personaje de Kendrick como eje central. En el reparto de “Love Life”, que mezcla drama y comedia, también aparecen Scoot McNairy y Zoe Chao.Sam Boyd es el creador de esta serie que cuenta entre sus productores con Anna Kendrick y con Paul Feig, director de “Bridesmaids” (2011) y que trabajó con Kendrick en “A Simple Favor” (2018). Feig fue, asimismo, uno de los protagonistas de la fiesta posterior al estreno virtual, que consistía en una plataforma interactiva en la que los invitados podían ir recorriendo los pisos de un edificio de apartamentos y descubrir diferentes atracciones en cada uno. Así, Feig se puso tras la barra y explicó cómo hacer cócteles, mientras que en otro piso de esta fiesta digital había una DJ tocando música relacionada con la serie. Una consejera sentimental ofreciendo reflexiones sobre el amor y una habitación con un karaoke completaron las propuestas de este estreno virtual. “Love Life” es uno de los contenidos nuevos y estrella para la presentación de HBO Max, la apuesta de WarnerMedia para entrar en el muy competido mundo del “streaming” y que comenzará a funcionar el 27 de mayo.

India's cricket board will not push for the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia to be postponed but would consider staging the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the October/November slot if it becomes available, a senior BCCI official has told Reuters.
 This year's IPL, which is worth almost USD 530 million to the BCCI, has been indefinitely postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic while the World Cup, which is scheduled to begin on Oct. 18, is also in jeopardy.
 Reports in Australian media have suggested India's influential board may look to push for the World Cup to be postponed to open up a winYouTube Mediadow for the IPL.
 World Cup contingency plans are on the agenda at next week's International Cricket Council (ICC) board meeting but BCCI treasurer Arun Singh Dhumal said India would not be recommending it be pushed back.
 "Why should the BCCI suggest postponing the Twenty20 World Cup?" Dhumal told Reuters by telephone.
 "We'll discuss it in the meeting and whatever is appropriate, (the ICC) will take a call.
 "If the Australia government announces that the tournament will happen and Cricket Australia is confident they can handle it, it will be their call. BCCI would not suggest anything."
 While Australia has seen new infections of the novel coronavirus slow to a trickle and is gradually easing travel curbs and social distancing restrictions, hosting a 16-team World Cup would be a Herculean task for Cricket Australia.
 Dhumal questioned whether the tournament should go ahead if it had to be played without spectators and said the Australian government would play a key role in any decision.
 "It all depends on what the Australian government says on this - whether they'd allow so may teams to come and play the tournament," he added.
 "Will it make sense to play games without spectators? Will it make sense for CA to stage such a tournament like that? It's their call."
 Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts was guarded about the prospects of staging the tournament as scheduled on Friday.
 "We don't have clarity on that one, yet. But as the situation continues to improve, you never know what might be possible," he said.
 "It's ultimately a decision for the ICC."
 The ICC has said it was unlikely to make a final call on the fate of the World Cup until August but some boards are in the process of making contingency plans in the event of a postponement.
 While the BCCI recognised an open October-November window would suit the IPL, Dhumal said there was no point in making plans until there was some certainty about the World Cup.
 "If we have the window available, and depending on what all can be organised, we'll decide accordingly," he added. "We can't presume that it's not happening and go on planning."

These new roles will "keep the drive-thru running smoothly, to manage delivery, curb- side pickup and mobile app orders, and to maintain industry-leading sanitation and cleanliness practices."
 Of course, hiring during the pandemic will look different too, and Taco Bell said it will be conducting virtual and curbside interviews to try and keep prospective employees and hiring managers as safe as they can. Taco Bell emphasized its "Start with Us, Stay with Us" platform in a release, saying "whether team members need a temporary job, or want to begin a career, they're welcome to join."
 Of course, safety is likely the biggest question on everyone's minds, as workers like those at Taco Bell are in close proximity to customers. The brand said that all employees will have their temperature checked using a contactless infrared thermometer and owners will provide gloves and masks to their team.
 "During these tough times, we want job-seekers to know that we're hiring and we're safe," said Taco Bell's chief people officer Kelly McCulloch.
 This news come as the U.S. unemployment rate hit recently hit 14.7 percent and many in the food industry saw a financial hit. But as Restaurant Business Online pointed out, this surge in hiring is a sign that fast food businesses, particularly Taco Bell, are seeing business stabilize.

Most of the vaccines in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize the spiky protein that studs the new coronavirus' outer surface, so it's primed to attack if the real infection comes along. The Oxford vaccine uses a harmless virus -- a chimpanzee cold virus, engineered so it can't spread -- to carry the spike protein into the body. A Chinese company created a similar shot.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Reconsideration of jobless aid is fast becoming the focus of congressional debate over the next virus aid package
 After the Senate decided to take a “pause” on new pandemic proposals, senators faced mounting pressure to act before leaving town for a weeklong Memorial Day break. Republicans are staking out plans to phase out coronavirus-related unemployment benefits to encourage Americans to go back to work.. The Senate also began efforts to fast-track an extension of a popular small business lending program.
 “Republicans and the White House are reaching consensus on the need for redesigning the unemployment benefits so they are not a barrier to getting people back to work,” Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters on a conference call. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell huddled at the White House to discuss the issues.

Fox Orders Season Two of ‘Prodigal Son’

By Nick Turner A time-honoured tradition at subscription services - hoping lapsed customers don’t realise they’re still paying every month - is going away at Netflix Inc. The company said on Thursday that it will check if inactive members want to keep the service - and automatically cancel their subscriptions if they don’t respond. “We’re asking everyone who has not watched anything on Netflix for a year since they joined to confirm they want to keep their membership,” Eddy Wu, who oversees product innovation, said in a blog post. “We’ll do the same for anyone who has stopped watching for more than two years. Members will start seeing these emails or in-app notifications this week.” Losing the customers shouldn’t be a big hit for Netflix. Inactive accounts make up less than half of 1% of its subscriber base, or a few hundred thousand, Wu said. That means the move could provide some relatively pain-free goodwill for Netflix -- and some anxiety for all the subscription services out there that are trying to lie low. 75502099

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco is joining other U.S. cities in authorizing homeless tent encampments in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a move officials have long resisted but are now reluctantly embracing to safeguard homeless people.
 About 80 tents are now neatly spaced out on a wide street near San Francisco City Hall as part of a “safe sleeping village" opened last week. The area between the city's central library and its Asian Art Museum is fenced off to outsiders, monitored around the clock and provides meals, showers, clean water and trash pickup.
 In announcing the encampment, and a second one to open in the famed Haight- Ashbury neighborhood, San Francisco's mayor acknowledged that she didn't want to approve tents, but having unregulated tents mushroom on sidewalks was neither safe nor fair.

Not everyone is unhappy, and the latest requirements of workers have opened a new niche for entrepreneurs like Sawan Laddha. The founder and chief executive officer of co-working startup Workie, headquartered in Indore in central India, has pivoted to solving the work-from-home challenges of regular people. Workie supplies work tables, chairs and leases laptops and wifi routers. It installs battery back-up systems so work can continue through power outages. In the past weeks, Laddha has helped over 1,000 workers get up and running. He says demand is red hot for one particular item: Green screens that help block out messy living conditions from bosses, co-workers and clients. “In the next two years, we plan to set up a million Indians to work from home," Laddha said.Meanwhile, a plea by the Bar Council of India, which represents the country’s lawyers, could offer a reprieve to vest-wearing attorneys. It’s called for Indian courts to ban video conferencing after the lockdown, saying advocates and judges are unaware of its nuances.
