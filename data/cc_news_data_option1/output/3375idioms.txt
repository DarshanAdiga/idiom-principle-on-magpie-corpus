Analysts are all over the place about which sectors might go where depending on the polls, so you’re welcome to read all those reports as the month continues. We’re not going to speculate beyond the general historical tendencies. What does seem likely is if the election appears close, things might get more frenzied—and stocks might come under pressure—as people start to worry about the chance of some sort of Bush-Gore 2000 repeat. If there’s one thing markets truly hate, it’s uncertainty.

Bear in mind that NIO officially launched its much-anticipated Battery as a Service (BaaS) subscription model at a dedicated event in Shanghai on the 20th of August. This essentially means that users will be able to save RMB70,000 ($10,116) on the purchase of NIO’s ES8, ES6, and EC6 models if they choose to rent their EV’s entry-level 70KWh battery pack, paying only RMB980 ($141) per month as a subscription fee for the BaaS facility. Apart from the reduced cost, NIO’s BaaS subscription model also allows its customers to keep upgrading their batteries periodically while retaining the rest of the EV construct. This effectively lengthens the useful life of a NIO EV.

The Fed might have added pressure on yields in August when minutes from its July meeting indicated heavy concern about the continuing economic impact of COVID-19. Another Fed meeting is right around the corner Sept. 15-16. The last one, in July, didn’t really have a huge impact on the market, with the Fed in a long-term holding pattern on rates. The same could be true this time, with maybe even more reluctance by Fed leaders to say much that might rock the boat with the election just six weeks out.

The Dormie Network takes an innovative approach based on anticipation and data collection. On a basic level, Plaster said, the network creates and shares custom profiles in order to be predictive. For example, a Ballyhack member may be making his first visit to Briggs Ranch, but the staff in Texas will know that he favors size L polos from Peter Millar, likes vodka transfusions at the turn and always wants the latest Titleist driver in the bag. The network has even created a personal shopping service – like a Trunk Club for golfers – to further leverage this data.

When you’re starting a responsible sourcing program, especially for ingredients like mica where no one’s really dove in to tackle them, it’s important to realize you don't have all the answers. At the end of the day, consumers are OK with that. I think oftentimes brands want to wait until everything is perfect in order to be able to tell the consumer about it. We've taken a different approach, which is, “We see this as a problem. We want to help be part of the solution. We’re going to bring you along as a part of that journey.”

There’s nothing all that new about the idea of letting inflation run hot, actually. In fact, even before the pandemic slowed price growth down to a trickle, the Fed had been talking about the possible benefit of letting inflation exceed 2% for a while if it got there (it never really did according to the Fed’s favored Personal Consumption Expenditure, or PCE index, which in June was up 0.8% year over year).

At this point, I need to credit The Kitchen food blog. One of their corn recipes was titled “Hot Honey Butter Bath Corn” and my eyeballs did a double- take. Whoa! That sounded pretty yummy. I perused the recipe and sure enough, there was milk (some), butter (lots), and honey (a drizzle). But the hook was the pinch of red pepper flakes and freshly ground black pepper. Such a fiery back when played on my mental palate had me willing to roll up my sleeves and give it a whirl. After all, I’d been eating corn slathered with chipotle butter for years.

We've all been there: you're just trying to watch TV or get some work done, when all of a sudden your eye starts gently pulsing and flickering, before morphing into some full-on twitching. But what _exactly_ causes eye twitching? According to Dhruvin Patel, an optometrist and founder of Ocushield, there are multiple possible reasons - and the majority aren't anything to be overly concerned about (so if you had visions of your eyeball falling out, you can put those to bed).
 Before we delve into the twitchy triggers, you might find it interesting to know what an eye 'twitch' actually is. "A pesky twitching eye is usually normal and nothing to worry about, it's an experience many of have already faced or will face," says Patel. "The mechanism behind this is electrical activity in the brain that causes nerve cells to send randomised signals to the muscles, which causes spasms."
 Potential triggers include not getting enough sleep, overloading your body with caffeine (possibly after the shoddy night's kip, which can also see you twitch as you're drifting off...) and feeling stressed. "Effectively, your body is trying to tell you something. Lifestyle choices like, too many sessions in the gym and sleeping less than 7 hours a day consistently can cause your eye to twitch. Don't ignore it, take rest and use this as a feedback mechanism," advises Patel. "Watch the amount of these hot drinks you consume and see if you can find a happy medium that stops the twitching, if the former method of topping up on sleep does not do the trick."

Elsa Pataky and Chris Hemsworth may seem like a picture-perfect couple; they're pretty much known for being beautiful and talented, with careers in huge Hollywood films like _Thor_ and _Fast and Furious,_ plus both of them are becoming big successes on the fitness scene with his workout app Centr (which Pataky features on). __So, it's frankly refreshing news that as the pair approach their 10th anniversary, Elsa has opened up about their relationship, saying it's far from perfect.
 Pataky and Hemsworth met in early 2010 after being introduced by agent William Ward. By that September they went public with the relationship and by December the pair were married, in a ceremony in Australia over Christmas weekend.
 In an interview with Australian fitness and health magazine _Body + Soul, _Pataky spoke about the couple's upcoming 10th anniversary, saying that getting to that point has taken effort from both of them.
 "It's funny that people think of us as a perfect couple," she told the publication. "No way; it's been ups and downs, and we still keep working at the relationship.
 "I think a relationship is constant work," she added. "It's not easy." But that's not to say it's been nothing but effort, and Pataky says that after 10 years the relationship is only stronger, telling the title, "I always try to see the positives of things."

Here’s the Smollett Effect: Jurnee Smollett, who began as a child actress in the black feminist _Eve’s Bayou_ and appeared as a precocious school student in Denzel Washington’s fatuous and historically inaccurate _The Great Debaters_ , has made her career within the confines of race exploitation. As an adult, she works in an era dominated by race manipulation — epitomized by her actor-brother Jussie’s infamous criminal deception. Jurnee Smollett’s Leti, a bimbo-activist, constantly outruns redneck police aggressors while Majors resembles a muscle-bound MLK clone out of a Tyler Perry wet dream. Both are perversely eroticized civil-rights-era fantasies. Again, the second-rate trickery known from Jordan Peele’s racial horror fiction (so far _Get Out, Us_ , and TV’s new _The Twilight Zone_ ) pushes the same buttons as Jussie Smollett’s felonious ruse.

First and foremost, let's kick this off by saying that bloating is nothing to be ashamed of (and can be caused by multiple things, ranging from a food intolerance to periods). At one point or another, it's likely we've all experienced it - and that includes Danae Mercer (a brilliant writer, _Cosmopolitan Middle East_ columnist and self love activist), who recently shared her experiences with her 1.3 million followers.
 Danae, whose feed is all about openly discussing the 'tricks' many use online (angles, lighting, apps etc) to change their appearance, also asked an important question in her post: _do you squeeze your tummy in all the time?_ Until stumbling across her page, I'd never really thought about it, but actually, the answer is yes. I'm _constantly_ breathing in, so as not to look bloated, and deliberately avoid tight-fitting clothes. And maybe you do too? Being asked to think about it so directly was a real wake-up call.  
 "Do you squeeze in your tummy all the time? I realised this month that I do it CONSTANTLY. I'm always trying to hide my bloat," wrote Danae, adding a reminder that while a small amount of bloating is par for the course, consistent or painful bloating isn't. "That's why I'm on this gut healing journey. I want to understand and fix whatever's going on, not just squeeze away the symptoms. Because while some bloating is normal, when it's excessive or painful, it's not."

Things are definitely blooming at The Lincoln Enrichment Center.
 A major fundraising effort, spearheaded by John W. Jones, was undertaken in 2018 for the playground and thanks to public and private donors including the Rotary Club of Wagoner, Lake Region Electric Cooperative, Arvest Bank, and the Wagoner Parrot Head Club, the state of the art playground was purchased and installed.
 This spring, the Lincoln Enrichment Center expanded the garden to focus on the Monarch Butterflies with education, learning, and demonstrations and added eight new garden beds. Due to the efforts of lead garden volunteer, Nancy Russell Waggoner, and several dedicated volunteers, nine different foods (tomatoes, peppers, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, summer squash, tomatillos, melons, watermelons and okra), 50 native perennial plants and flowers, and eight annual nectar plants were grown this summer. The organization also applied for and received free milkweed plants from Kansas University in order and became a Monarch Watch Station.

NTPC has set its eyes on entering the Round the Clock (RTC) renewable energy power business. This is significant because NTPC is India’s largest thermal power generator but with a footprint in RTC renewable energy, the public sector undertaking would be future proofing itself.
 “NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) has signed a pact with Greenko Energies Private Limited for exploring the possibility of entering into an arrangement for trading, collaboration and partnership in Integrated Renewable Energy Storage Projects set up by Greenko to offer Round the Clock (RTC) renewable energy power to potential customers in India,” a NTPC statement said.
 The pact with Greenko Energieswill help NVVN to establish itself in various segments of RTC bundled renewable power, the statement added.
 NTPC Group presently has a total installed capacity of 62.9 GW. The group has over 20 GW of capacity under construction of which 5GW comprises of renewable energy generation projects.

But party conventions take the cake for useless televised politics. They are professionally packaged infomercials delivering the parties’ own message, with no pushback from moderators or competing candidates: _We’ve been sent from heaven to make your lives better; the other guys hate you and everything this country stands for_. One rah-rah speech after another; night after night of endorsements from a candidate’s most fervent supporters and most faithful allies, painting the two sides in the most extreme colors possible and often trying to raise their own profiles in the process.

The consulting duo also identified the port’s core message: “The Port of Anacortes is a driver of regional economic vitality and quality of life in the community.”
 The strategies for community engagement include communicating directly with constituents to keep them informed, utilizing media relations to share stories about the port and enhancing existing community partnerships and forming more.
 A main focus will be to highlight the port’s environmental action, which includes being a voluntary member of Green Marine environmental certification program and having spent $60 million in environmental cleanup projects with another $5 million planned.
 “This plan is really about the port bringing the community along on your adventure,” Wilund said.
 The plan includes refreshing the port’s website, creating a new website to highlight the “Big Four” projects, creating an email newsletter list and employing a digital ad campaign.
 Commissioner Jon Petrich said he thought it was important to include an educational aspect in the plan explaining the history behind port districts for those who might not be aware.
 “There’s a lot of good information in there that I think people who are otherwise indifferent to us or other ports would really build support,” he said.
 Commissioner Ken Goodwin said he liked the idea of having a structured site for the community to engage with the port with questions or concerns, as well as a place for more information about port projects.
 “I’m excited about rolling this out,” Executive Director Dan Worra said, adding that there is room for fine tuning along the way.
 Brenda Treadwell, director of planning, properties and environmental, presented the commission with a status update on the port’s capital improvement projects this year and a preview of projects in 2021.
 The airport is in a preconstruction phase for stormwater detention pond improvements. An obstruction survey to identify any trees that may be in the way is also upcoming as is a paving project outside the operational fence to improve the area.
 Marina projects include a plan to install an additional high-speed fuel dispenser; making progress on the A-Dock demolition and replacement; looking into replacing T-Dock and adding wood shims to the dock’s piling; refreshing the marina wifi; and restoring the former National Council for Air and Stream Improvement site.
 At port-owned properties, the port is in the planning phase to develop the Rockwell site, redevelop the NW Basin and survey the conditions of the Marine Supply and Hardware site. It is currently cleaning up the Quiet Cove site and improving the Barthelomew site.
 Other projects include dock float repairs, electrical upgrades and the addition of moorage cleats to a pier bullrail. It is also extending the port maintenance and storage building, redeveloping the Cap Sante Marina RV Park and upgrading the Cap Sante Marina restroom.
 “It’s very ambitious, and that’s impressive to see all the work that’s underway,” said Commissioner Joe Verdoes.
 Treadwell’s presentation served as an update to commissioners, and planned projects for the next year will still be brought for formal approval before work begins.
 The Washington Public Port Association Legislative Committee announced its fall schedule to identify legislative priorities for the coming year, giving the Port of Anacortes a chance to bring its ideas forward and raise issues with the Legislature. Ports around the state will combine ideas and select potential priorities before a Board of Trustees finalizes the selection.
 “We’ve been doing a pretty good job of heading out and talking to our federal and state elected officials trying to further advance our causes and get grants and get help on accelerating permits,” Worra said. “There’s a lot of great things that come out of that, but at the end of the day, we need to have a priority list.”
 Typically the port discusses priorities toward the end of the year to coincide with the annual port day visit to Olympia at the end of January, but has been advised to accelerate that timeline to ensure priorities will be heard.
 “Federally what’s important to us is permit reform,” Worra said. Delays in permitting have historically delayed port projects significantly, sometimes for very routine maintenance projects, he said.
 The commissioners approved continuing a professional service agreement with GeoEngineers to clean up the Dakota Creek Industries site.
 There was a $3.3 million in-water contamination cleanup there in 2009. An upland cleanup is still needed, Treadwell said.
 “After years of testing and some negotiations with Ecology, the remedy that appears to be rising to the top as the preferred alternative is a small amount of excavation,” she said. The authorization with GeoEngineers is an $87,000 soil sampling and design cleanup alternatives to make sure contamination is addressed.
 In other port news, Moody’s Investor Service gave an Aa3 credit rating to the port’s $7.9 million limited tax general obligation and refunding bonds.

Smurfit thinks that “wanting to be able to work and wanting to have a life outside of parenting” has made life tougher on mums. “Our generation is probably the first that’s done it cohesively. The next generation may choose to stay at home. Having been a working mum and a full-time-at-home mum I can tell you that being a full-time-at-home mum is a much tougher gig than going to work. It is much harder, there’s no two ways about it. I go to work for a break – a thousand per cent. Because you have a singular focus.”

Take a look at the left-hand column above: even in April, when we were in the teeth of the lockdowns, things weren’t _that_ bad. Unless you were running a retail REIT, you were still looking at just a 10% (or less) delinquency rate. And remember that _even those “lost” rents were mostly deferrals_. So REITs will still see most of that cash—it’s just kicked down the road (and will come back with interest!).

She said Laura was set to start college soon and pursue a career in teaching just like her mother.Kimberly Wall added that there was one thing Laura would always do before she would leave the ones she loved.“She said, ‘You should always say I love you when you leave because something might happen.’ She would say, ‘I love you, Mom,’ and if I did not immediately say it she’d say, ‘I love you, Mom,’ just to make sure I said it back and I’d say, ‘I love you too Laura,‘” Kimberly Wall remembered about her daughter.The family told WMBF News that Laura was getting ready to move to her new home and she was doing some final touches with the help of her stepfather before the crash and shooting.The shooting happened around 5 p.m. Monday near the intersection of Indian Hut Road and Highmarket Street, according to the Georgetown County Sheriff’s Office.Tysheem Walters IIIUpon arrival, deputies learned three people had been shot, reportedly during a fight over a car crash.An incident report states when law enforcement arrived, one of the victims had already been taken to the hospital while a second victim was begin given CPR on the scene by EMS.A third victim was on scene walking around with an apparent wound to his left wrist, the report states. Law enforcement established a perimeter both there and on Kent Road, as authorities said they’d been told the suspect was headed southbound on Kent Road.Dispatch notified authorities the suspect, identified as 23-year-old Tysheem Walters III from Moncks Corner, had been seen walking on Georgetown Highway toward Andrews, according to the report.When law enforcement went to the area, Walters was spotted and he ran into the woods near Kent Road, authorities said.

First up, government needs to ensure that the economic benefits of UK science and innovation are far more widely shared geographically. One significant step would be to devolve a substantial proportion of the extra public money earmarked for R&D to the regions, towns and cities of the UK.

Secondly, the UK needs to become far less agnostic about the direction that innovation and scientific research takes, abandoning the long-held assumption that new technologies automatically deliver public benefit in the long run. This means a more serious commitment to direct funding towards socially important challenges like decarbonisation and the ageing population.
