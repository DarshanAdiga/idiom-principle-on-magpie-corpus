BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) " Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins announced Wednesday that he's jumping into Louisiana's U.S. Senate race, trying to unseat Republican incumbent Bill Cassidy in a last-minute entrance into the competition as the candidate signup period began.
 The Democratic mayor of the northwest Louisiana city, in office since December 2018, launched his campaign with an introductory video describing his Army career, including his graduation from the U.S. military academy at West Point and his deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He said Washington's poor handling of the coronavirus outbreak persuaded him to jump into the Senate race on the Nov. 3 ballot.
 'I'm running for United States Senate because our country and state are at a crossroads. We face a virus that threatens our lives, our safety and our economy, but Washington's political games are only making us sick," Perkins, a lawyer, said in a statement provided to The Associated Press. "Together, we can demand a government that serves all of our people, not just the wealthy and well-connected.'
 He joins at least three other announced Democratic contenders trying to oust Cassidy, who is favored for reelection. But Perkins is the only one in elected office, with a natural platform for fundraising. Still, the Shreveport mayor faces a difficult road " taking on a Republican incumbent in a red state who has millions of dollars in the bank. Perkins will need to raise cash quickly to be a viable challenger.
 Perkins' announcement came as the qualifying period for Louisiana's fall U.S. Senate race and other congressional elections opened.
 Four of the five Louisiana congressmen who are running for another term signed up for their reelection bids Wednesday morning. Republican Reps. Steve Scalise, Mike Johnson and Garret Graves and Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond each had someone else file their registration paperwork while they remained in Washington for congressional work. All but Graves had drawn a challenger by midday.
 The candidate registration period runs through Friday. Perkins was expected to file his paperwork to get on the ballot Thursday.
 Cassidy, a doctor from Baton Rouge, is seeking a second six-year term after defeating three-term Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu in a hard-fought, expensive race in 2014. This time, he's the advantaged candidate, with a sizable campaign account and high name recognition to bolster his campaign.
 Cassidy reported $6 million in his latest finance report filed with the Federal Election Commission. No other candidate reported more than a few thousand dollars on hand.
 In the Senate, Cassidy has been a reliable conservative Republican vote and a policy wonk who often works on health care issues. He's won praise from President Donald Trump as a go-to senator for his health care knowledge " and the president has endorsed Cassidy's reelection bid.
 Other candidates who signed up to challenge Cassidy include Antoine Pierce, a Baton Rouge Democrat and community organizer, and John Paul Bourgeois, an epidemiologist and public health librarian from Gretna who has no party affiliation.

Flipkart Group, on Thursday, announced the acquisition of Walmart India and launch a new digital marketplace - Flipkart Wholesale to tap into the retail market in India.
 The e-commerce platform has acquired a 100 percent stake in Walmart India, which operates the Best Price cash-and-carry business. This acquisition was announced with the launch of Flipkart Wholesale, a new digital marketplace to help transform the Kirana retail ecosystem in India.
 Flipkart Wholesale will launch its operations in August 2020 and will pilot services for the grocery and fashion categories. It will be headed by Adarsh Menon, a veteran at Flipkart. Sameer Aggarwal, Chief Executive Officer at Walmart India, will remain with the company to ensure a smooth transition, after which time he will move to another role within Walmart.
 Adarsh Menon, Senior Vice President and Head - Flipkart Wholesale, said, "Flipkart Wholesale will further deepen and build on Walmart India and the Flipkart Group's commitment to kiranas and MSMEs over the last several years. Thousands of kiranas have already partnered with Flipkart to enhance their business and income streams. I am excited to be part of this new initiative that allows us to expand opportunities for growth for them and bring further prosperity to their lives. We will leverage the synergies between Flipkart and Walmart India as we stay focused on transforming the wholesale experience for kiranas and MSMEs."
 Walmart India has more than 1.5 million members and runs 28 stores in the country.
 With this reverse acquisition of the business-to-business segment of Walmart in India, Flipkart Wholesale will leverage Flipkart's technology and its supply chain infrastructure to reach kiranas and MSMEs across the country.
 Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Chief Executive Officer, Flipkart Group, said, "The acquisition of Walmart India adds a strong talent pool with deep expertise in the wholesale business that will strengthen our position to address the needs of kiranas and MSMEs uniquely. With this development, the Flipkart Group will further build upon the synergies across its businesses to drive greater value and choice for end-consumers and businesses alike."
 With the acquisition of the Walmart India business, its employees will join the Flipkart Group and the home office teams will integrate over the next year.
 Judith McKenna, President and Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International, said, "Today marks the next big step as Walmart India's pioneering cash-and- carry legacy meets Flipkart's culture of innovation in the launch of Flipkart Wholesale. By leveraging each other's strengths and unique expertise, this combined team will break new ground in their shared mission to help Indian businesses grow and succeed. We look forward to a bright future for Flipkart Wholesale."
 The announcement comes a week after Flipkart had said it had raised $1.2 billion in funding from a Walmart-led investor group. In 2018, Walmart Inc had invested $16 billion for acquiring 77 percent stake in the group.

The truth is that the market has been very dependent on Fed stimulus for years now, both expecting and demanding it. Each attempt, however timid, at tightening has been met by a market hissy fit and more stimulus. In the near term, second-quarter corporate earnings season, coming soon to a theater near you, could produce some shocks and provoke a sell-off in stocks. At minimum, we expect individual stocks to be hit hard, and we anticipate volatility over this period.

We have somehow come to be obsessed with seeking certificates from international agencies because we have come to believe (erroneously though) that &amp;ldquo;Yog&amp;rdquo; needs to become &amp;ldquo;Yoga&amp;rdquo; before it gets to be recognised in the country of its origin. That is perhaps the reason we have done everything to climb up the World Bank Ease-of-Doing- Business ladder and go to town when the bank &amp;ldquo;certifies&amp;rdquo; that we have climbed a few rungs.Ironically, even this assessment was initially carried out in India in the cities of Mumbai and Delhi where apparently there is hardly any &amp;ldquo;space&amp;rdquo; for industrial development. Thus, we had a piquant situation. Even though India continued to climb the World Bank ladder, industrial production and investments continued to grow at a pace that didn&amp;rsquo;t make us proud. The disconnect between such assessments and ground reality needs to be appreciated.Assessments and evaluations have an important role to play but we should first be able to establish the need and then identify the objective of such assessments clearly before going ahead. If the objective is to demonstrate to the world that we have already arrived or to junk the past, these assessments will serve only that purpose and will not lead to any improvement in the state of affairs.If the objective is to diagnose the causes of the malady, we must see whether the diagnosis is already available and whether the problem is more in terms of application than with diagnosis. In most of the cases, the diagnosis is available. We know why things are not working. The problem is that first, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to accept the existence of a problem and then want to use an assessment to prove that &amp;ldquo;all is well&amp;rdquo;. Accepting a failure, a mistake, or existence of a problem created by one&amp;rsquo;s failures/mistakes is not easy. Hence, we take a convenient path.In a number of cases, we do accept the existence of a problem but want to get our own diagnosis done, blissfully oblivious of some diagnosis that is already available or, even when acknowledging the availability of diagnosis, we consciously choose to dump the previous one. The National Education Policy (NEP) is a classic example of such an approach. It has been in the making for more than six years. There was a committee headed by late Mr T S R Subramanian that submitted a report. This report never saw the light of the day. This was followed by another committee, headed by Dr Kasturirangan. This report has also yet to see the light of the day.The problems relating to school education are pretty well known. Fortunately, most of the prescription also exists. However, what is missing is the application. Hence, the need to draw out an action plan for each state separately clearly outlining what needs to be done, how it will be done and who would do it. Plans for a couple of states are already been prepared. They need to be implemented and similar plans to be prepared for other states. If anything, baseline assessments of these states would be in order so as to assess the impact of these plans in the future.We need to look at the issues mentioned earlier before taking yet another plunge into the PISA pool. Assessment needs to be linked with action. Just an assessment, as envisaged under PISA, will be a waste of time and will perhaps meet the same fate as the last one. On the last occasion, states (Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh) considered to be doing well in the field of education were picked up for PISA but the results were not as anticipated.Consequently, the report was dumped. We don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have learned from that experience and are going ahead with a similar exercise picking up &amp;ldquo;better performing&amp;rdquo; schools. PISA itself is not the remedy for what ails school education and the manner in which it is being sought to be conducted will certainly not make any difference. So, why waste time, effort and money on this? How about putting in place an independent institution within the country that helps us assess the ground reality and enables us to take corrective measures periodically? NCERT had done a decent job in conducting the NAS in 2017. We need to build upon it.&amp;mdash;Anil Swarup is former Secretary, Government of India and author of the book 'Not Just A Civil Servant'.

Of the over 6,000 contact trace cases that Bahrain published, more than 2,600 involved Indian nationals, while 1,310 were Bahrainis and 1,260 were Bangladeshi. More than 400 came from Pakistan, with a similar number from Nepal.
 Those figures in Bahrain and Qatar likely track across the wider Gulf Cooperation Council, the regional bloc that also includes Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, all of which rely on a vast foreign labor pool already potentially infected.
 Though other GCC nations haven’t broken down coronavirus cases by nationalities, a recently published article in the Oman Medical Journal said that of the sultanate’s first 1,304 cases of the virus, 29 percent of patients were Indian, 20 percent were Bangladeshi and 10 percent were Pakistani.
 Their living conditions likely make them more at risk of contracting the virus, as Bahrainis and Qataris usually live in single-family homes. The spread mirrors the contagion seen in boarding schools and other places where people live together in communal spaces.

Hagia Sophia, or the Church of Holy Wisdom, was built by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I on the site of an destroyed basilica of the same name. Completed in 537, it was among the world’s largest domed structures and would serve as the foremost Orthodox Christian church for some 900 years. Imperial ceremonies, including the crowning of emperors, were held there. The multicolored mosaics depicting the Virgin Mary, the baby Jesus, angels and other Christian symbols along with emperors and their families that centuries of rulers installed added to its reputation as an architectural gem.
