Anyone who grew up with Bollywood knows Raj Kapoor and Nargis singing in the rain pointed us to him saying, 'Phir bhi rahegi nishaniyan'. Rishi Kapoor then showed up as a lad who discovers love in the shape of a girl who wears shorts and knotted blouse. The polka-dotted dress on a girl who calls Rishi Kapoor, 'Dibba!' became all the rage then, but he carried pants with flaps on his front pockets and nylon printed shirts and giant round sunglasses with equal elan. What made Bobby so special was this very young lad running away with Jack Braganza's daughter. But first, it taught Indian girls and boys to 'go Dutch' on a date. As Jack Braganza said, and I paraphrase, there's so much money in my cupboard as there are fish in the sea. Yes, Raj Kapoor did get young Dimple Kapadia to wear an orange bikini and white shorts while playing badminton while the lad watched her. While Rishi Kapoor does sing, 'Main shayar toh nahi…' the song is all about Aruna Irani's bare back and her cleavage.

(News story) Brandon G. Schnorf, Jr., a Marine Corps veteran of the Korean War and Purple Heart recipient and, like his father, a longtime lawyer, who acted on his commitment to clients and community, died April 20 at Sunset Village, Sylvania Township. He was 88. He had heart disease, his wife, Roxie Hill, said. The couple moved to a villa on the Sunset campus in August, 2017, from Sylvania, their home the previous 23 years. Mr. Schnorf, a 1949 DeVilbiss High School graduate, left his studies at Dartmouth College in 1951, went to San Francisco and enlisted in the Marines. "He always said it was the right thing to do and it was an honor to serve my country," his wife said. In late 1952, while an artillery observer with his Marine Corps unit, he was wounded in the hand, according to account in the former Toledo Times. Then, in March, 1953, he was wounded in the leg by a mortar shell. He was presented the Purple Heart at the U.S. Naval Hospital, Great Lakes, Ill., the Times reported June 1, 1953. Mr. Schnorf was most apt to speak of the Marines he served with, "and how much he admired them and their courage," his wife said. He returned to Dartmouth and received a bachelor's degree. He received his law degree from Ohio State University. Mr. Schnorf joined the Ohio Bar in October, 1958. He began to wind down his practice about 2006, said Kevin Ferguson, his law partner for more than 20 years. "He was my mentor," Mr. Ferguson said. "He was a really brilliant guy. An excellent writer. He had such a fluid knowledge of English." Mr. Schnorf, his father, and his late brother, David, practiced as the firm of Schnorf, Schnorf, and Schnorf. A former president of Glass City Toastmasters, Mr. Schnorf won speech contests and, in the 1960s, formed a club to help high school students hone their public speaking. Years later, he helped students at Scott and Libbey high schools, largely behind the scenes. At Scott, his father's alma mater, he coached students in public speaking; made sure promising athletes had the attention of colleges and universities, and helped outfit the weight room. He was a lead sponsor of the appearances in 2001 at Scott and Libbey of Herman Boone, the former football coach depicted in the film 'Remember the Titans,' and of a former Labor Department chief economist, who spoke on the importance of post-secondary education or training in a trade. "A lot of people didn't know the depth of Brandon's commitment to young people. Brandon never bragged about it," his wife said. He was born Aug. 9, 1931, to Lela and Brandon Schnorf and grew up on Meadowwood Drive in the Old Orchard neighborhood of West Toledo. He was formerly married to Helen Knierim Williams. Surviving are his wife, Roxie Hill, whom he married Oct. 1, 1994; daughter, Karen Hemsoth; sons, Craig Schnorf and Carl Patrick; stepsons, James and Jason Hill; nine grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters. Private services were at Walker Funeral Home, Sylvania Township. A celebration of life and graveside military honors will be held later. The family suggests tributes to Corpus Christi University Parish, the Toledo Legal Aid Society, a charity of the donor's choice. This is a news story by Mark Zaborney.

As one of the world's largest and fastest-growing markets (e-commerce is growing 4X faster than the overall retail industry), e-commerce penetration in India is expected to rise to 6.2 percent (FY23) with total sales of $62.3 billion.

 Ernest J. Nauful, Jr. COLUMBIA - Ernest J. Nauful, Jr., 78, died on Tuesday, April 28, 2020, after a short illness. Born in Columbia, S.C. on September 28, 1949, he was the son of the late Ernest J. Nauful, Sr. and Elizabeth Gloria Joseph. He is survived by his wife, Brenda Bradley Nauful, who was the love of his life and his best friend for over fifty years. Mr. Nauful was a lifelong resident of Columbia, where prior to his retirement he practiced law for forty-two years. He was also a veteran proudly serving in the United States Air Force Reserves. He was a graduate of the University of South Carolina, having earned an undergraduate degree in business management in 1965 and a J.D. degree in 1968. He was a pre-eminent attorney known statewide for his trial skills and expertise in healthcare law, medical malpractice and occupational diseases. He was admitted to the South Carolina Supreme Court, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Claims, and the United States Supreme Court. He co- authored "Hospital Consent Manual and Legal Reference Guide", South Carolina Bar's Jurisprudence "Hospital Law", and a national publication in the Journal of the Federation of Insurance Counsel on "Peer Review". He was instrumental in drafting the laws in South Carolina related to Emergency Medical Services and served on the State Emergency Medical Services Advisory Council, including a term as chairman, for eighteen years. While in undergraduate school, he served as Charter President of the Carolina Chapter of the American Management Association. He was a member of the Richland County Bar Association, South Carolina Bar, where he served as a member of the House of Delegates, Federation of Defense Counsel, American Society of Law and Medicine, South Carolina Society of Hospital Attorneys, South Carolina Defense Trial Attorneys Association, where he served as a member of the Board, Secretary/Treasurer and President. He was a charter member of the South Carolina Chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates. An active member of St. Joseph Catholic Church for most of his life, he served as Chairman of the Planning Committee, Building Committee, Finance Council and Special Advisor to the Pastor. He also chaired or co-chaired three capital campaigns for the church and school. He was proud of his service as both a Lector and Extraordinary Eucharistic Minister, but especially those occasions on which he could still serve as an altar server, even after reaching his seventies. Throughout his life he was known to a few for his extraordinary generosity to those in need, especially family and close friends. A rabid Gamecock fan, he was a member of the Gamecock Club for over 50 years and particularly enjoyed Carolina football and baseball. His family and close friends will miss his superb culinary skills. During his lifetime he enjoyed gardening, fishing, and hunting. He was a skilled handyman and could repair almost anything. Although he was grateful for his many professional accomplishments, he was likely the proudest in 1982, when the esteem to which he was held by the medical community he served as an attorney, was recognized with an honorary life membership in the Lexington Medical Association. He was a recipient of the Pinnacle Award from The Palmetto Hospital Trust, PHT Services, LTD, and Palmetto Health Liability Program for his contributions to the three organizations. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two brothers and four sisters, Eli Nauful (Betty) of Columbia, Rose Mary Nauful of Greenville, Lillie Morris (Pat) of Manor, Ga., George Nauful (Lisa) of Los Angeles, Ca., Victoria Sanders and Catherine Nauful, both of Augusta, Ga. He had numerous nieces and nephews, as well as great-nieces and great-nephews. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all services will be private. The family suggests in lieu of flowers, memorials be made to St. Joseph Catholic Church; Lutheran Homes Foundation; or the USC College of Nursing Scholarship Fund. Dunbar Funeral Home, Devine Street Chapel, is assisting the family. "Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful. It is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way. It is not irritable or resentful. It does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, endures all things. Love never ends Faith, hope, love abide, these three, but the greatest of these is love." Memories may be shared at www.dunbarfunerals.com

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The COVID-19 outbreak means North Carolina's intermediate-level appeals court will make history by hearing oral arguments in a case using online video. Three judges from the 15-member state Court of Appeals plan to listen to lawyers remotely on Thursday afternoon through videoconferencing. That will be a first for the court. Judges Lucy Inman, Valerie Zachary and Reuben Young are presiding over a case involving a civil lawsuit that alleged battery during an encounter between two men outside a Cabarrus County tool shop more than 10 years ago. The defendant appealed a $3 million verdict favoring the plaintiff. Members of the public also can watch the arguments online, like they can in person under normal circumstances. The videoconferencing arrangement comes as the judicial system has postponed cases in courtrooms across the state due to the pandemic. The state remains under a stay-at-home order.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-MISSOURIKansas City, St. Louis County town move up reopening datesO'FALLON, Mo. (AP) — Missouri’s largest city will reopen with significant restrictions next week, as jurisdictions in even the state’s two urban areas begin to move away from stay-at-home orders spurred by the coronavirus. Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas on Wednesday announced that starting May 6, some “nonessential” businesses may resume with limits on crowd sizes and, in some cases, requirements that contact information of those in attendance be recorded. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson’s stay-at-home order ends Sunday, but Kansas City, Jackson County, St. Louis and St. Louis County previously announced plans to extend their orders through at least mid- May.VIRUS OUTBREAK-MISSOURI-ENTERPRISE LAYOFFSEnterprise rental company lays off more than 2,000 employeesCLAYTON, Mo. (AP) — Rental car company Enterprise Holdings has laid off more than 2,000 employees, including making some previously announced furloughs permanent. In letters to the state, Enterprise said the layoffs were caused by a dramatic downturn in business caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Enterprise had previously announced plans to lay off some workers but had not disclosed the number of affected employees. Some layoffs began in late March but others will become official on Thursday. The company said the layoffs would be spread through nearly every category of employee and in several Enterprise locations, including its headquarters in Clayton,GIRL STRUCK-PATROL VEHICLESt. Louis County officer charged in death of girl hit by carST. LOUIS (AP) — A St. Louis County officer who struck and killed a 12-year-old girl with his patrol vehicle has been charged with second-degree involuntary manslaughter. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Garden on Wednesday charged officer Preston Marquart in the death of Akeelah Jackson. The girl was hit Oct. 14 while crossing a street in St. Louis and died several weeks later. Marquart's lawyer and the St. Louis Police Association said a police investigation determined no charges were warranted and accused Gardner of pursuing a political agenda. Authorities said Marquart had been pursuing a suspicious car and was not using his lights or sirens when he hit Akeelah.COLUMBIA KILLING-SENTENCEMan sentenced in murder of man who shot Columbia activistAn Illinois man who fatally shot a man who killed a Columbia community activist has been sentenced to 17 years in prison. Laron Nesbitt, of Calumet City, Illinois, was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty to second- degree murder. He was accused of killing Deonte Gainwell in January 2019. Gainwell shot and killed activist Ahmonta Harris in November 2018. Prosecutors said they would not have charged Gainwell in that shooting because it occurred while Harris was breaking into Gainwell's home. Before his death, Harris frequently attended community meetings to urge young people to stay away from violence.FATAL POLICE SHOOTING-SIKESTONMan fatally shot by police in southeast MissouriSIKESTON, Mo. (AP) — A southeast Missouri man died after being shot by police during a confrontation. Sikeston authorities say officers responding to a call about shots being fired early Wednesday found a 49-year-old man who had been shot several times. Jim McMillen, director of Sikeston's public safety department, says the man told officers his son shot him and then fled. McMillen says when the suspect returned to the scene, he ignored officers' commands and asked officers to shoot him. McMillen says the situation escalated and officers shot the man. Three officers were placed on administrative leave, which is routine in such shootings.VIRUS OUTBREAK- VACCINE MISINFORMATIONGroups sow doubt about COVID vaccine before one even existsNEW YORK (AP) — Public health experts say a vaccine may be the best chance of stopping the coronavirus. Yet even though it could be months or years before a working vaccine is ready, groups that have spread misinformation about immunizations in the past are raising doubts. Some claim vaccine trials will be dangerously rushed; others say better treatments are being ignored to enrich vaccine makers. Then there are more far-reaching claims that Microsoft founder Bill Gates plans to use a vaccine to inject microchips into people or reduce the world's population. Experts say such claims could prove lethal if they undermine support for vaccines.JAIL SEX ASSAULT INVESTIGATIONClay County deputy accused of sexually assaulting inmateLIBERTY, Mo. (AP) — Authorities in suburban Kansas City say a Clay County Jail deputy has been placed on leave after being accused of sexually assaulting a man being held on charges in the jail. The Kansas City Star reports that the inmate was taken to a hospital Saturday after accusing the deputy of rape and later returned to the jail, where he's being held in a restricted area. Clay County Sheriff's spokesman, Capt. Will Akin, says an investigation into the allegations has been launched, and the alleged victim will be moved to another jail while he awaits trial on charges of burglary and first-degree sexual abuse. Akin declined to release the accused deputy's name.AP-US-MISSOURI-BOAT-ACCIDENTCoast Guard, Ripley Entertainment criticized in boat crashLIBERTY, Mo. (AP) — National federal safety regulators say actions by the owners of a tourist boat that sank in Missouri in 2018 and the U.S. Coast Guard contributed to the tragedy that killed 17 people. The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday if the Coast Guard had followed recommendations for fixing small passenger boats that it has pushed for 18 years, the duck boat likely would not have sunk. The Coast Guard said last week it will recommend that canopies and side curtains be removed from amphibious tour vehicles known as stretch duck boats like the one that sank at Table Rock Lake.
