Many Black students, mindful of societal inequities, realize they live in a world that was not built for them. What they may not know, however, is that some of the best and the brightest in the Black community launched their careers after attending HBCUs, including Martin Luther King Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Oprah Winfrey, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Marian Wright Edelman, Kamala Harris, and Chadwick Boseman.

Además, la Provincia debe estar preparada para asignar una porción razonable de su capacidad fiscal al servicio de la deuda y no buscar, de manera oportunista, reescribir los términos de los contratos existentes.

LONDON (AP) — America’s top infectious disease expert has apologized for suggesting U.K. authorities rushed their authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine, saying he has “great faith” in the country’s regulators.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had sparked controversy with an earlier interview in which he said U.K. regulators hadn’t acted “as carefully” as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Fauci said late Thursday that he meant to say U.S. authorities do things differently than their British counterparts, not better, but his comments weren’t phrased properly.“I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community at the U.K., and anyone who knows me and my relationship with that over literally decades, you know that’s the case,” Fauci told the BBC.Britain on Wednesday became the first Western nation to authorize widespread use of a COVID-19 vaccine when regulators gave emergency approval to a product made by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany- based BioNTech. Critics have suggested that U.K. regulators emphasized speed over thoroughness when they reviewed data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.Fauci rejected that idea.The FDA has to move more slowly because of the high degree of skepticism about vaccines in the U.S., Fauci said. Because of this, U.S. regulators are reviewing all of the raw data from Pfizer and BioNTech “in a way that could not possibly have been done any more quickly,” he said.It will take the FDA at least another week to complete its review, but the U.S. and Britain will ultimately end up in the same place, Fauci said.“At the end of the day, it’s going to be safe, it’s going to be effective,” he said. “The people in the U.K. are going to receive it, and they’re going to do really well, and the people in the United States are going to receive it, and we’re going to do pretty well.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

In un tegame scaldate 5-6 cucchiai d'olio e insaporitevi la cipolla tritata finemente e gli spicchi d'aglio. Quando la cipolla e diventata trasparente e gli spicchi d'aglio sono dorati, aggiungete le acciughe dissalate e tritate, i pomodorini tagliati a spicchi e, dopo alcuni minuti, i calamari. Lasciateli insaporire per 5 minuti, spruzzate il vino e fatelo evaporare, eliminate l'aglio e proseguite la cottura a fuoco dolce per circa 20 minuti, quindi regolate sale e pepe.

Look closer, dig deeper and go further, and the differences begin to emerge. For starters, the game chooses not to go for a kawaii aesthetic in terms of characters, setting and story, and instead tells a most accessible tale set in a lighter version of a decidedly adult universe. The telling of the story is also more focussed and less meandering than in the other titles mentioned above and in their own way, the puzzles ( those blessed puzzles ) contribute to pushing that narrative along. The combat too feels a lot deeper and once you get the upgrades, more nuanced than those other games.

TenetDirector Christopher NolanCast John David Washington, nbsp Robert Pattinson, Dimple Kapadia, Kenneth BranaghRating Don t try to understand it, feel it, says a scientist, early on Christopher Nolan s Tenet, to the leading man John David Washington. That s some solid advice to the viewer as well. Walking into a theatre after eight months for most , there couldn t have been a film more fitting. The disorderly scheme of affairs amidst which the film released worldwide is a perfectly relatable setting for a film of this nature. Tenet is that glorious Nolan outing, where physics trumps philosophy. It is baffling, bold and beautiful making the audience weigh in on the concepts of fate and reality. Much like the filmmaker s previous works, Tenet is in equal measures abstract and convoluted but as we get sucked into its tapestry, the pieces of the puzzle start falling together. It kicks off as a spy actioner at the Kiev Opera House under siege due to a terrorist attack but we slowly make our way towards the core theme of the film time inversion, giving a new age spin to the old age idea of time travel. Mounted on a wide canvas, for the first 30 minutes, you are simply immersed in the universe that you are trying to make sense of. Luckily for us, Washington mirrors our mental space and together with him, we walk through the warp and weft of this complex narrative. Seducing us with gorgeous car chases and death defying action sequences which are shot at gorgeous, mystical locations across the world, Nolan holds our attention through the two and half hour runtime as he untangles multiple narratives, one scene at a time. There is a definite lack of depth because emotions here are far more muted than some of Nolan s previous films. A primary climax hook involves a mother and son relationship that s never delved into through the entire span of the screenplay. As the narrative swiftly cuts between past and present, defying chronology in a way that the film deems fit, its performances anchor the storyline that could appear to be scattered. Robbert Pattinson as the English handler Neil is terrific. So is Kenneth Branagh, who is a tad hammy with his thick Russian accent as the Russian Oligarch Sator, but he makes you buy into his devilish designs. His wife played by Elizabeth Debicki who will be playing Princess Diana in the next season of Crown provides this crowded plot with the much needed vulnerability. For us Desi cine goers, it s Dimple Kapadia playing Priya with robust confidence, that is truly satisfying. If it s possible, she is more in her element than she has ever been, owning the screen every time she is on it. What you can t fault the film for is its neat action sequences including a car chase sequence that appears twice over. Inverted bullets as an idea captivates your imagination certainly. In terms of grandiose, Tenet is a blockbuster that paces briskly towards a delicious climax tying up the plot in a fine manner. After a year like 2020, this is the kind of movie you d want to go back to the big screens for. But the problem here is that it isn t entirely emotionally moving in a way Interstellar was. Staying true to his style Nolan does inspire your imagination. I wondered if the time inversion theory could ve been used to go back in time and avoid COVID entirely. In the director s own words from Inception, You mustn t be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling... Now is that a good sign that Tenet makes you quote an earlier film of his.

Looking at the broader economy, the actual recovery and its timing hinge on the containment of the coronavirus spread. Our dashboard Trends In U.S. Covid-19 Cases provides an overview of how the pandemic has been spreading in the U.S. and contrasts with trends in Brazil and Russia. Following the Fed stimulus — which set a floor on fear — the market has been willing to “look through” the current weak period and take a longer-term view. With investors focusing their attention on 2021 results, the valuations become important in finding value. Though market sentiment can be fickle, and evidence of an uptick in new cases could spook investors once again. At levels of $39, PFE stock is trading at 13x its 2021 estimated adjusted earnings of $2.88, in-line with the 13x multiple seen over the recent years. However, now with de- consolidation of low margin businesses, Pfizer’s earnings growth will be higher compared to prior years, and this will likely result in expansion of its multiple, implying the stock could see further gains from the current levels.

Avantika Malik s social media posts often drop hints about her state of mind. Imran Khan s estranged wife s latest cryptic post reads When valued personal relationships go silent, trouble often follows. I am not talking about productive time outs that are clearly expressed. I m talking about silence than is reactive, or an attempt to do harm. This kind of silence ensures that the connection will not find its was back to health. Because silence fosters confusion, projections, and worst of all mdash assumptions about what the other is feeling or thinking. And assumption doesn t get us anywhere good. Inquiry does. The message continued, Assumptions ensure that the wall will only get thicker until there is no way to reconnect. Whatever you do, even if you are justifiably angry, try to keep the door to inquiry open. You may not be ready to process the experience but allow for the possibility that you one day will. Because valued connections are hard to find in this crazy world. Anger doesn t have to be the end of the story. Sometimes the portal to a closer connection. Sometimes, it s the way through to great learning. Inquiry is the bridge. While Malik keeps sharing messages alluding to her troubled marriage, Khan has disappeared from public view. On December 1, Avantika Malik shared a long post, talking about the practice of Nichiren Buddhism . I can t recommend the beautiful, life changing practice of nichirenbuddhism enough. As someone who has always struggled with religion still can t hack it , a spiritual grounding has given me a sense of courage, wisdom and compassion I had no idea I was capable of. The key to victory in life is belief. The belief that better things await us because they always do. Never let your mind lie to you and tell you it s all hopeless. Master the mind. And here is the tool for it. A simple nammyohorengekyo. If you are struggling please give it a shot. Start with chanting nammyohorengekyo for 2 mins a day and see the power of it carry you through the darkest of storms. Thank you sanabhgrover for giving me this beautiful philosophy. Apart from being a parent, being a bodhisattva gives me a deep sense of fulfilment.

Deprem kuşağında yer alan Manisa'nın Gölmarmara ilçesindeki 420 yıllık Halime Hatun Camii'nin deprem terazileri ilk günkü gibi dönmeye devam ediyor. Osmanlı'nın mimarlık şaheserlerinden bir olan ve zaman içinde yüzlerce depreme tanıklık eden tarihi cami hem mimarisiyle hem de dayanıklılığıyla yıllara meydan okuyor.
   
 Osmanlı padişahlarından Sultan III. Mehmed'in (1595-1603) sütannesi Halime Hatun tarafından cami, medrese, dârülhadis, sıbyan mektebi, kütüphane, imaret ve misafirhaneden meydana gelen Halime Hatun Külliyesi içinde kalan caminin deprem terazileri yapıldığı günkü gibi dönmeye devam ediyor. Cami, medrese ve imaretle aynı yüzyılın sonlarında vakfa gelir sağlamak amacıyla külliyeye eklenen çifte hamamlar hala ayakta dururken, tek kubbeli tipte olan cami plan bakımından Bursa Alâeddin Bey Camii'ne ve yine Gölmarmara ilçesinde 14. yüzyılın sonlarına doğru yapılan Şahuban Hatun (Kadın) Camii'nin daha gösterişli bir benzeri olarak yıllara meydan okuyor. Manisa'nın en küçük ilçelerinden olan Gölmarmara ilçesindeki külliye içinde bulunan Halime Hatun Camii, hem mimarisiyle hem de sağlamlığıyla yıllara meydan okuyor. Cami mihrabının her iki köşesine yerleştirilen mermerden yapılan deprem terazileri ise ilk yapıldığı günkü gibi rahatlıkla dönmeye devam ediyor. Deprem terazilerinin rahat bir şekilde dönmesi 420 yıldır caminin ne bir depremden ne de bir göçükten etkilenmediğinin en bariz özelliği olarak dikkat çekiyor.
   
 Caminin geçici imam hatibi Mehmet Fatih Güçlü, “Halime Hatun Camii, Sultan 3. Murad'ın oğlu şehzade Mehmet'in dadısı Halime Hatun tarafından 16. yüzyılda yaptırılmıştır. Cami medrese ve imaretten oluşan bir külliyenin parçasıdır. Camimize sürekli ziyaretçi geliyor. Cami dayanıklılığını korumakta. Camideki deprem ölçer hala dönüyor. Yaşadığı depremlere karşın hala sağlam ve zemininin oynamadığını ve camide bir hasar olmadığını gösteriyor” dedi.
      
 “Tam bir mühendislik dehası”
   
 Caminin her türlü bakımını yıllardır gönüllü olarak yapan cami cemaatinden Ali Erdemir ise, “Halime Hatun, eski Ozanca denilen yerden gelme. Padişahın süt annesi ve onun adına yaptırılmış. Halime Hatun Vakfı diye geçer ve Akhisar'a kadar uzanan bir vakıftır. Yalnız Halime Hatun buralı değil, Ozanca köyünden. Onun adına yaptırılmış 1500'lü yıllarda. Cami bugüne kadar sağlam gelmiş ama duvarların çoğu sıvama. Bu sıvaları kaldırıp orijinaline döndürülse daha iyi olur. Caminin içinde teraziler var. Depreme karşı yapılmış ve dönmeye devam ediyor. Caminin bir tarafına eğim verdiğinde fark etmeye yarıyor. Bu şekilde olduğunda o taşlar dönmez. Bu tam bir mühendislik dehası. Buralar hepsi sonradan bu hale geldi. 1965'lere kadar caminin bahçesi bile orijinal taşlarla döşeliydi, sonradan bunlar değiştirildi.”

For decades Iowa commodity producers have had chance after chance to be better land stewards and time and again they have proven they are not up to the challenge.
 To assist with increasing water quality there are voluntary cost share programs, organic farming methods, no till methods, easements, and state and private ecologists willing to assist producers to increase water quality. It is time to change the dynamic. This carrot approach has failed and the pollution crisis has only gotten worse. In 2018 there had been a 50% increase in nutrient runoff despite federal and state funding to reduce this number by voluntarily following water best management practices according to a 2018 Des Moines Register article.
 Commodity producers across the board have failed to protect the water, the topsoil and the surrounding ecosystem for future generations.

Se TikTok ha guadagnato la simpatia e la popolarità grazie alla sua interfaccia semplice e intuitiva, Instagram Reels è penalizzata un po’ su questo aspetto.

La nuova funzionalità, se nella creazione dei contenuti video è molto vicina a TikTok, per la visualizzazione degli stessi deve essere “scovata” (si trova in una sezione a parte del singolo profilo utente).

Genesis Block Ventures (GBV), an investment branch of Genesis Block, acquired the Ethereum second-layer solution provider OMG Network (OMG). GBV has a strong presence in Thailand and other Asian countries. OMG acquisition aims to enhance its blockchain ecosystem and promote OMG Network adoption in the Asian region and beyond. GBV to promoteOMG Network in the Asian region GBV has been a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. The team entered many partnerships with the leading players in the space, including Binance and FTX. Following the acquisition, a number of integrations and partnerships are in the works; GBV and OMG will work closely together to leverage resources and explore new directions, such as building lending and trading platforms, to achieve DeFi's massive adoption and growth potential, the press-release says. The team confirmed that OMG's native token would retain its functionality as a utility token within the OMG Network. The blockchain project will continue working on its short-term goals as a Layer-2 infrastructure provider for the ETH network. However, in the long run, it will re-focus on more partnerships to broaden the use cases. OMG skyrockets following the acquisition news The community cheered the news as the native token of OMG Network jumped by over 20% in less than an hour. At the time of writing, OMG is changing hands at $4.3 amid strong bullish momentum. If the growth is sustained, the price may retest the intraday high of $4.4, which also served as resistance during the September recovery attempt. OMG's 1-hour chart Meanwhile, the In/Out of the Money Around Price data confirms a supply wall around $4.4 area. Over 1,000 addresses holding 535,000 coins create a local resistance here. If it gives way, the buying pressure may increase with the next focus on $4.8 and $5. OMG's In/Out of the Money Around Price data On the other hand, OMG sits on top of an important support area on approach to $4. The IOMAP cohorts show that 1,140 addresses previously purchased over 1.85 million tokens between $4 and $4.13. This area can absorb the selling pressure and create a new bullish impulse.

Surrounding it all is a charming — if a tiny bit sparse — world filled with beautiful vistas, vivid lighting and a host of interesting non-playable characters. I use the word ‘charming’ quite intentionally because despite some odd and inconsistent textures (the grass for instance, which takes a fraction longer to show up than the rest of the environment, and when it does, it often looks slightly off), distinctly average lip-syncing and host of admittedly far from game-breaking graphical gremlins (whether it’s an NPC disappearing momentarily in a cutscene or the remnants of a deceased enemy refusing to leave the screen for quite a bit longer than one would like), Immortals Fenyx Rising is extremely easy on the eye. I’d go as far as to say that flaws in some cases even give it more of a personality.

The global spread of Coronavirus has meant there just aren’t many people visiting doctors for non-emergency cases, and several types of elective surgeries are being postponed, impacting the sales growth of pharmaceutical companies, such as Regeneron. While the company’s Covid-19 treatment may not be a big drug in terms of sales after the vaccines hit the market, Regeneron’s Eylea looks reasonably strong and Dupixent – an antibody used for allergic diseases, co-developed with Sanofi – also holds significant promise. Eylea sales stood at about $4.6 billion and about $2.3 billion for Dupixent in 2019, with Sanofi indicating that Dupixent could have peak sales of over $10 billion. Now with economies opening up, Regeneron can see expansion of sales for these drugs.

LONDON (AP) — America’s top infectious disease expert has apologized for suggesting U.K. authorities rushed their authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine, saying he has “great faith” in the country’s regulators. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had sparked controversy with an earlier interview in which he said U.K. regulators hadn’t acted “as carefully” as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Fauci said late Thursday that he meant to say U.S. authorities do things differently than their British counterparts, not better, but his comments weren’t phrased properly. “I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community at the U.K., and anyone who knows me and my relationship with that over literally decades, you know that’s the case,” Fauci told the BBC. Britain on Wednesday became the first Western nation to authorize widespread use of a COVID-19 vaccine when regulators gave emergency approval to a product made by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany- based BioNTech. Critics have suggested that U.K. regulators emphasized speed over thoroughness when they reviewed data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. Fauci rejected that idea. The FDA has to move more slowly because of the high degree of skepticism about vaccines in the U.S., Fauci said. Because of this, U.S. regulators are reviewing all of the raw data from Pfizer and BioNTech “in a way that could not possibly have been done any more quickly,” he said. It will take the FDA at least another week to complete its review, but the U.S. and Britain will ultimately end up in the same place, Fauci said. “At the end of the day, it’s going to be safe, it’s going to be effective,” he said. “The...

(AP) – The days of pets flying with their owners in airplane cabins for free are coming to an end.The Transportation Department issued a final rule Wednesday covering animals on airlines. It decided that only dogs can fly as service animals, and companions that passengers use for emotional support don’t count.The rule aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional help. Under a longstanding department policy, all the passengers needed was a note from a health professional.Airlines argued that passengers abused the situation to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles, pot-bellied pigs and, in one case, a peacock.The agency said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board “eroded the public trust in legitimate service animals.” It also cited the increasing frequency of people “fraudulently representing their pets as service animals,” and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals, ranging from peeing on the carpet to biting other passengers.The Transportation Department proposed the new rule back in January and received more than 15,000 comments. While 3,000 commenters favored dropping protections for support animals, 6,000 spoke in favor of them, including people suffering from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, the department said.The Paralyzed Veterans of America said the mere presence of a dog, cat or rabbit — even if untrained — can help some travelers, and pet fees of up to $175 one-way are a hardship on low-income people.The new rule will force passengers with support animals to check them into the cargo hold — and pay a pet fee — or leave them at home. The agency estimated that airlines will gain up to $59.6 million a year in pet fees.The number of animals on planes took off several years ago, and a cottage industry grew around providing papers, doctor’s notes and even dog vests for support animals.Delta Air Lines says it carried about 250,000 animals including service dogs in 2017 and about 600,000 last year.Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability. Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog’s health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can’t bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of support animals biting passengers and growling or barking at guide dogs for the blind.Airlines for America, a trade group for the biggest U.S. carriers, said the new rule will protect passengers and airline employees while helping people travel with trained service dogs.The Transportation Department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds as service animals. That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned “pit bull type dogs” in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, “At this time, there are no changes to Delta’s current service and support animal policies.”___David Koenig can be reached at&nbsp;www.twitter.com/airlinewriterCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

“It’s good to have people who know how to roam the halls of Congress,” said Andrew Card, who directed George W. Bush’s transition and later served as the Republican president’s chief of staff.
 Biden’s transition team declined to comment on the prospects of any individual contender for an administration role. He has already unveiled much of his economic and national security team and is expected to announce picks soon for key health positions.
 But there are still a large number of major Cabinet positions to be filled, including attorney general and leaders of the departments of Labor, Commerce and Transportation. As Biden considers his options, his personal connection with some of the defeated lawmakers could carry significance.
 Finkenauer, who is under consideration as Labor secretary, owes her start in politics in part to Biden. As a college student, she worked on his ill-fated 2008 presidential campaign. A decade later, he headlined a rally for her winning congressional campaign. She was a key surrogate for Biden ahead of the Iowa caucuses.
 “I know they have a long relationship, and it’s been mutually supportive,” said former Assistant Dubuque City Manager Teri Goodmann, who is a decades- long Biden supporter and has watched Finkenauer’s rise.
 Finkenauer narrowly lost her bid for a second term in a rural northeast Iowa district. But since then, the former state legislator, who made a name promoting public employee unions, has had conversations with senior Biden transition officials about leading the Labor Department, according to Democratic sources familiar with the communications.
 Jones, meanwhile, is in the mix to lead the Justice Department, partly due to his work as a U.S. attorney who helped convict Ku Klux Klansmen for the Birmingham church bombing that killed four Black girls.
 He narrowly won a special Alabama Senate election in 2017, but lost reelection last month. He also has a longstanding personal relationship with Biden dating to Biden’s first presidential campaign in 1988.
 Biden spoke at Jones’ campaign kickoff in 2017, saying of Jones, “He knows your heart and will never let you down,” and was the first to telephone him on Nov. 3 after he’d lost the seat to Republican Tommy Tuberville.
 Shalala is perhaps the most administration-ready of 2020’s losing Democratic class. She spent eight years as secretary of health and human services under Bill Clinton and then served as president of the University of Miami before winning a south Florida House seat in 2018. She has heard from Biden transition officials.
 Beyond the outgoing members of Congress, Biden is also considering his former rivals in the Democratic primary for jobs. He already tapped California Sen. Kamala Harris as his vice president.
 Biden is weighing roles for Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor who mounted a surprisingly strong campaign in the early stretch of the Democratic primaries. Biden has expressed deep affection for Buttigieg, who was one of the first major candidates to drop out of the race and endorse Biden.
 Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who lost his Senate bid after leaving the White House race, is part of discussions for a Biden administration role, perhaps as secretary of agriculture. Another name under consideration for agriculture is former North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who lost in 2018 but has been a champion of reinvigorating rural America.
 “If they think I can be helpful, then good,” Heitkamp told The Associated Press recently.
 Presidents have often sought losing rivals for positions. Republican Donald Trump chose fellow 2016 GOP presidential candidates Rick Perry as energy secretary and Ben Carson for housing and urban development. Democrat Barack Obama notably chose former rival Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state after the 2008 election.
 Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft’s defeat in 2000 paved the way for his four years as attorney general under George W. Bush, including during the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.
 Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who lost election to a third term in 2004, was tapped after the 2008 election by Obama to head health and human services, which would have put him at the forefront of the health care debate. Daschle withdrew from consideration after questions arose about his failure to properly report and pay income taxes.
 The most successful losing congressional candidate of the past 50 years is George H. W. Bush, who as a two-term Republican U.S. House member from Texas lost his 1970 bid for Senate against Democrat Lloyd Bentsen.
 As a consolation, President Richard Nixon picked Bush to be ambassador to the United Nations, a disappointment for the up-and-comer who was hoping for a treasury job. But the post led to an ambassadorship to China, and the experiences were valuable when as president he found himself leading a global coalition in Operation Desert Storm.
 “The significance is that was the beginning of his self schooling and expertise in foreign affairs,” said Chase Untermeyer, director of White House personnel during George H. W. Bush’s administration.
 In a White House led by a Capitol Hill veteran like Biden, a team with a background in Congress is particularly valuable to those around the president, since Biden remains well acquainted with the rules and many members.
 But considering Biden hasn’t been a senator in nearly a dozen years, Card said those with more recent experience in Congress will be helpful.
 “More than helping the president, these people can help the White House staff dealing with members of Congress,” said Card. “They know where the congressional gym is, and how to get invited to a congressional luncheon. And that’s an advantage.”

There is a park in the nether regions of Versova that the locals call Coconut Garden . The place gets swamped with joggers and evening walkers just before sunset every day, with families out for a stroll often stopping by for pani puri at a stall just outside the garden. The man who sells them shares the spot with a couple of vegetable vendors, who now have a new neighbour a food truck called Tooq Tooq that sells a range of Parsi street snacks. It s a strategic location. The truck occupies one corner of a four way junction that comes to life soon after the joggers put their running shoes on, and aunties and uncles decide to spend quality time outdoors with their children. The owner launched it last Saturday, and the place caught our eye when we were walking to a friend s home that is right next to Coconut Garden. But they had run out of stock on that first day, so we made a mental note of returning there to sample the menu, our interest having been piqued. Marghi na cutlace In the meantime, we started getting rave reviews from fellow Versova residents. One person told us the food is very good while another said that it s superb . This raised our interest levels even higher, so we returned around 7 pm earlier this week, since the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The menu has 10 items, of which we picked kheema na pattice 150 , marghi na farcha 170 , Parsi kavab roll 170 , chilli bun 150 and marghi na cutlace 150 . Owner Rushad Cyrus Balaporia left and Chef Brandon Pinheiro The owner asked us whether we would like to take a walk and return in about 15 minutes, and offered us a complimentary cup of tea while we wait. We decided to stay put there itself, our secret intention being to gauge the sort of response this new venture is getting. The spot where Tooq Tooq is located. Pics Bipin Kokate Within minutes, a couple of girls dropped by and then an elderly gentleman. They were followed by a family of four, who stopped at the truck more out of curiosity than anything else, before deciding to move on after realising that there isn t a single vegetarian dish on offer yet. If location is everything, Tooq Tooq has hit the nail on the head. What also helps is that the owner, who introduced himself to us as Rushad, has a pleasant personality that is inviting without being in your face. Rushad told us that his philosophy is to promote Parsi street food the stuff that his mother makes at home in a city that s as flooded with sev puri and vada pao sellers as Delhi is with chhole kulche stalls or Kolkata is with shops selling sandesh. The man is clearly passionate about his community s cuisine because when we said that we want the fur cha while placing the order, he corrected us saying that the actual pronunciation is faar cha instead. Refreshingly, he also told us that he shunned food aggregating apps since he wants to build a sense of community in the area, with people stepping out of their homes in the evenings to get a quick bite with their family or friends. But since we were on our own, we decided to get the grub packed and take it back home, which is a hop, skip and jump away. The moment of reckoning had arrived. Would the food live up to its hype Was it indeed superb or at least very good One bite of the cutlace confirmed that our friends hadn t been kidding. The subtly flavoured minced chicken ensconced in slightly greasy batter brought out an instant mmmm from us in approval. The pattice followed a similarly satisfactory flavour profile, though the meat in it is mutton and the outer coating consists of creamy potatoes fried in batter. The chilli bun was the only aberration in our order, in the sense that its description said that the filling is made of Kolkata style chilli chicken, which made it the sole non Parsi item we tried. And the good news is that the pieces of meat in it did remind us of what you d get in Tangra, the Chinese grub hub in the West Bengal capital, without setting our mouth on fire. Next, we returned to the venture s core competency with the meaty Parsi kavab roll, which puts a regular frankie to shame as much as a man who loses his trunks in a swimming pool would feel. But it s the faar cha that emerged as the stand out dish, the hunky chicken thigh having been marinated to such perfection that we felt as if we had been deprived of this classic delicacy all our lives. It means that we had such a fabulous experience overall that despite having the disposition of a couch potato, we, too, might take up jogging at Coconut Garden just so that we have an added excuse to try the fare at Tooq Tooq. Time 5 pm to 9 pm all week At Close to Coconut Garden and Leaping Windows in Versova, Andheri West.

When you get to the national security law… I think this happens a lot with civil liberties, whether it’s free speech, free expression and whatever. You suddenly begin to appreciate and understand them when they come under fire. You cannot be complacent, and you have to continually exercise them. So we make sure that we turn up to press conferences of Hong Kong’s leaders, and take full advantage of these small opportunities we have to speak truth to power, to hold them to account, be a voice for the voiceless, and all of these cliches we used to hear in university, all of these ethical dilemmas that we studied in theory and in books. It all became very real in Hong Kong!

Likewise, for the value of press freedom, you suddenly appreciate it when they stop rounding up journalists and raiding newsrooms. I mean to give one example, were it not for whistleblowers and journalists in the very early days and weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, it would have been very difficult to [get] a grip of the outbreak; as fast as Beijing was able to [break the news], but of course, it’s still hindered by the lack of press freedom there. If journalists were able to report immediately what was going on… You can understand the value of having a free press to hold the authorities to account when things like this happen. So yeah, we kind of appreciate it a bit more in Hong Kong ‘cause it’s so under fire.

With some holiday charm, an array of terrific performances from its cast and a delicate handling of LGTBQIA+ subject matter, “Happiest Season” is one of my favorite films of the year.
 Stewart and Davis have incredible chemistry. Through the trials and tribulations of their relationship, the strong performances do the script justice. I found myself fully invested in their relationship. The situational comedy of the couple hiding their affection during their stay is very funny.
 Stewart’s shy demeanor is used to her benefit. Her acting strengths are on full display. There are some very emotional scenes that require a lot from her and Davis — and they crush it.
 The film’s supporting talent is excellent. My favorites were Plaza and Levy’s characters, respectively. Plaza is an ex-girlfriend of Harper’s who fills in some interesting story gaps. Levy plays Abby’s best friend, who gives her advice about how to come out to Harper’s parents.
 Levy has some hilarious scenes — perhaps the funniest in the film. I loved his dry comic timing. Surprisingly, he also does wonders in some more tender scenes in the third act. He’s far from a one-note best-friend archetype.
 I was impressed with how nuanced the subject matter was portrayed. Especially being a PG-13 comedy, I was fearful that the film would be watered down. I barely questioned its PG-13 rating or felt that the material was under- represented. There are some challenging scenes that deliver the resonant emotional punch that they require. Bravo to DuVall for pulling these scenes off in a convincing manner.
 Stewart and Davis show up in full force and steal the show. With a strong supporting cast, focused direction and an excellent display of real-world representation, I definitely recommend it. Despite some side characters that lack as much depth as I would have liked, it’s a small complaint that’s easily overshadowed.
 “Happiest Season” is a heartwarming examination of love — and I hope it gives closeted people the strength to come out. For everyone else, I hope it leaves them feeling as good and as entertained as I was.
 I give “Happiest Season” 4.5 stars out of 5. The film is rated PG-13 and runs for 1 hour and 43 minutes. It’s available to stream on Hulu.

CHARLOTTE -- An elderly motorist whose SUV slammed into the back of a horse- drawn buggy on a southern Michigan road, killing three Amish children from the same family, will not be charged, a prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
   
 Because of his age, the coronavirus pandemic and his lack of a criminal history, it's unlikely that Ronald Ramsey, 84, would spend time in jail if he were charged and convicted in the Sept. 18, 2019, collision, the Eaton County prosecutor's office said in a news release.
   
 "After a complete analysis of the case and possible consequences, the conclusion was reached that formal charging and conviction of Ramsey was not likely to accomplish more than a conviction on paper," the office said. "The ends of justice would not be advanced by such a prosecution."
   
 The three siblings -- ages 8, 10 and 13 -- were killed and their 6-year-old brother was hurt when their buggy was struck on a road near Charlotte, about 105 miles (170 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. They were heading home from school at the time.
   
 The buggy was properly marked with lights and a slow-moving vehicle triangle, and it was on right side of the road when it was struck. One of the children was wearing a reflective safety vest.
   
 Ramsey, of Vermontville, was travelling 60 mph in a 55 mph zone and told investigators that he didn't see the buggy until his Chevy Equinox hit it.
   
 "I relive that every day, especially with three little ones gone," Ramsey told The Associated Press during a phone call Wednesday. "I can't help but relive it."
   
 Ramsey said he no longer drives.
   
 He could have been charged with three misdemeanor counts of committing a moving violation that caused a death, which carries a maximum sentence of a year in jail. The three counts would have been served at the same time, according to the prosecutor's office statement.
   
 Ramsey's driving privileges were suspended for a year. Before he'd be allowed to drive again, he would have to pass a vision exam, a written knowledge test and a road test.
   
 "The decision to not charge Ronald Ramsey for the crash is not a statement about his criminal culpability, rather a decision that charging him would not be likely to result in any additional sanction or punishment," the prosecutor's office said.
   
 The children's parents were consulted before the decision was made to not charge Ramsey was made, it said.

Sylvia Luke, who also chairs the House Finance Committee, the state received clarification from the federal government that as long as plans for the money has been processed, checks can still be cut 90 days after the deadline of Dec. 31.“That helps us a lot,” Luke said. “Because if we were to put in all the documentation by Dec. 31, some of the programs would have to stop in about two weeks.”Luke said because of the breathing room, she’s confident most of the money will be spent on what it was budgeted for.“It looks like around $50 million will go to unemployment because the departments have done such a good job in expending a lot of money,” Luke said.Along with other lawmakers, Luke is worried about the programs that were established with CARES Act money.“The need continues for PPE, hygiene equipment, testing,” she said. “It will continue to be a concern.”Hawaii Attorney General Clare Connors has joined her counterparts in other states in urging Congress to extend the deadline.A bipartisan group also introduced a more than $900 billion plan for relief.But extensions and future funding are still up in the air.“How are we going to sustain these kinds of costs now going into the new year when we’re still going to have to be doing contact tracing and testing?” Jill Tokuda, adviser to the Hawaii Data Collaborative said. “And now hopefully a vaccine rollout as well, which is not free and takes money.”She said that’s the reason why there’s a push on the federal level for more aid.“I think all eyes are on the congressional negotiations right now to see what even relief can they pump out for the first quarter of next year,” Tokuda said.Copyright 2020 Hawaii News Now.
