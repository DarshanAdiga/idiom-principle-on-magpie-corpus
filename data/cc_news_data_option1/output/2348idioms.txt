Haviland Heritage Foundation board members eagerly opened museum doors for the 2020 season on June 13 with a full slate of displays for visitors.
   
 "I'm excited to share the heritage with people in the area," said Lori Binford. "I'm excited to see how the community has embraced the museum and are continuing to make contributions,"
   
 The original plan for the months of May and June were to focus on the Haviland School System with displays of memorabilia, pictures, and clothing in conjunction with alumni weekend and the All School Reunion. Due to COVID-19, the reunion was canceled and the museum opening was pushed back. June will still witness displays focused on Haviland School's history. In July and August visitors to the museum will be able to learn about the way area farmers used to harvest their crops with a Heritage and Farming Display. Along with farmhouse memorabilia and farm toys on display, a painting by American artist Mort Kunstler will be on display. September will feature a focus on Historic Homes in Haviland. There will be pictures, facts, and stories about some of Haviland's oldest and most unique homes. In conjunction with the museum layout, there will be a guided tour that can be taken to see the houses in person while reading about their history.
   
 "We have a lot of new projects on the horizon, such as the home tour planned for late summer early fall," said Binford. "We are currently working on an opportunity to restore a historic Haviland home, which will allow us to share and display more of our collection."
   
 The historic home restoration that Binford mentioned is a work in progress but would be a big undertaking for the foundation. As this opportunity materializes there will be more coverage.
   
 The Haviland Heritage Museum is entering its third year of being open, all with Lori Binford as the museum director. The goal of the foundation is to preserve the history and heritage of Haviland while sharing the town's legacy in tangible ways.

FORT WALTON BEACH -- Okaloosa County School Superintendent Marcus Chambers thinks of himself as a career educator, but he said Monday that he has enjoyed his first foray into politics.
   
 Chambers is campaigning to hold onto a job Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to about 18 months ago and he's facing veteran politician Ray Sansom as he strives to hold onto his seat.
   
 Campaigning has been a joy, Chambers said, because of the affection county residents hold for the school district.
   
 "I'm excited to make phone calls, walk neighborhoods and meet people," he said. "People love this school district. They care about this school district. And not only about the education, but about the arts, and the band and the sports."
      
 Sansom, however, said he hears something different from constituents.
   
 He said he's being told county voters believe that only veering away from Chambers and the leadership team put together by ousted former Superintendent Mary Beth Jackson, will return the district to the glory of its past.
   
 The opponents spoke at the second of two socially distanced political forums sponsored by Crestview Community Television TV and the Greater Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce.
   
 Chambers and Sansom both pointed out how crucial it is for Okaloosa voters to pass in November a sales-tax to rebuild crumbling school district infrastructure.
   
 Sansom said if he is elected Aug. 18, on the next day he will begin a new campaign to insure passage of the tax.
   
 "When people have the leadership they can count on they will support a sales tax," he said.
   
 School Board candidates Sherri Cox and Marci Gardner, running against one another in District 2 to replace outgoing Dewey Destin, also spoke of the importance of passing a school district sales tax.
      
 "I'm a strong supporter," said Gardner. "I'm retired, on a fixed income and I don't have children, but at one time someone provided support for my children."
   
 Cox said that as a local leader of the Republican Party, her instincts lie with conservative values and anti-taxing sentiment. The sales tax, she said, is one tax she can support.
   
 "To keep what makes Okaloosa County Schools as coveted as they are, we have to restore these aging facilities," she said.
   
 Also speaking Monday, were candidates for the District 5 county commission seat being vacated by Commissioner Kelly Windes.
   
 Given an opportunity to endorse a candidate in the District 4 state representative's race, Mel Ponder, who exited that seat for a shot at the county commission, politely declined to do so.
   
 Ponder said improving existing road infrastructure is a priority and suggested sports tourism could be a way that Okaloosa County could help diversify its economy.
   
 Candidate Rich Johnson said the county commission should focus on "jobs, jobs, jobs" as it strives to meet an economic slump sure to result from the coronavirus epidemic.
   
 Parker Destin said he would work to make personnel cuts to alleviate county funding shortfalls a last resort.
   
 Wes Fell, who decided last week to run as a non-party affiliated candidate, said he would like to see Okaloosa County eliminate an $8 million subsidy it provides to the county's Convention Center and use that money to pay tolls for people crossing the Mid-Bay Bridge.

Notwithstanding the cap on COVID-19 costs, patients checking into private hospitals may still have to dig deep into their pockets to pay for the treatment.
 According to the government order (GO) issued on Monday, charges for treatment in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is ₹7,500 per day which will go up to ₹9,000 if the patient is provided with ventilator support. For admission in a routine ward, the daily tariff has been fixed at ₹4,000.

Edinson Cavani e il Napoli: da anni i tifosi sognano il ritorno del "Matador" che ha lasciato la piazza azzurra nell'ormai lontano maggio 2013. Ancora oggi l'attaccante viene nuovamente accostato al club partenopeo. Secondo quanto riportato dal portale francese Le 10 Sport, l'entourage del giocatore uruguaiano avrebbe avuto contatti proprio con il Napoli in vista della fine del rapporto con il Paris Saint-Germain. Le soluzioni per Edinson Cavani sono diverse, con l'Atletico Madrid che resta alla finestra e l'Inter accostata proprio negli ultimi mesi all'attaccante. Sembra, però, che al momento anche Aurelio De Laurentiis sia pronto a tornare alla carica, con l'intenzione di offrire un contratto importante al suo ex giocatore.

 This is perhaps the first time India is facing trouble from all sides of its main border — with Nepal, China and even Pakistan.
 Nepal, a neighbour which was once friendly and much smaller geographically, is staging a quarrel with India, perhaps punching above its weight. How India handles the sudden and caustic development needs to be seen. And has the Defence Minster’s statement (Inside pages, “India, Nepal share close ties: Rajnath”, June 16) come too late?
 We then have Pakistan and its pinpricks in the strange episode of the staff of the Indian mission in that country disappearing for a while. All is not well on that part of the border too (Editorial, June 16).

This year?
 Such games are being looked at with a big question mark because of precautions, limitations or even bans that might be in place to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 A few area football teams have games against teams from outside Ohio. Mentor is slated to play Clarkson (Canada) in its season opener. Kirtland is scheduled for a trip to Oil City, Pa., on Sept. 18 to play the alma mater of Coach Tiger LaVerde. Buffalo (N.Y.) St. Francis is set to come to Mentor to face Lake Catholic on Sept. 26 for a 3 p.m. game.
 Will they take place as planned?
 Good question.
 "That is completely up in the air right now," said Mentor coach Matt Gray of the game with Clarkson. "I'm a little nervous about that one, to be honest with you."
 If travel restrictions are in place and those teams aren't able to travel across state or national borders, teams might be faced with an open date they didn't anticipate when they scripted their schedules.
 "Who knows if they're going to be allowed to come in to play?" questioned Lake coach Marty Gibbons of St. Francis' scheduled trip on Sept. 26.
 The out-of-state games on tap are one of a number of interesting tidbits when looking over this year's high school football schedules.
 Others are:
 • Does any team in the area play a tougher, nastier schedule than Benedictine?
 Probably not.
 The Bengals, who will play their home games this year at Euclid Community Stadium, according to Coach Jarritt Goode, have a schedule that includes home games with Toledo Central Catholic, Austintown-Fitch, St. Edward and Lake Catholic, along with road games at Massillon, Akron Hoban and Euclid. The rest of the slate is Shaker Heights, NDCL and Cleveland Central Catholic.
 Gulp.
 "There are some noticeable names on there," said Goode with a chuckle when glancing at his team's schedule. "It reminds me of what we did when I played there. That's what you come to Benedictine for — to get a good, quality education and play top-tier athletics.
 "Our goal is to win Week 15," Goode continued, a feat that would mean a Division II state title. "We feel as though we have the people place to do that. That's why we're the 'Home of Champions.' "
 • Akron Buchtel doesn't show up on area schedules too often, but the Griffins will do so twice this year.
 Mayfield opens its season at Buchtel on Saturday, Aug. 29 at 1 p.m. A week later, Coach Ricky Powers' team makes the trip to Chardon to face the Hilltoppers.
 Buchtel replaces Walsh Jesuit on Mayfield's schedule, while the Griffins replace Perry on Chardon's slate.
 "They're the only one within reason who wanted to play us," said Mayfield coach Ross Bandiera. "It's Ricky Powers' team, so you know they're going to be well-coached. It's a new opener for us."
 Bandiera voiced his desire a year ago to drop Walsh Jesuit as his team's opener because of the long-standing friendship he has with new Walsh coach Nick Alexander, who played at Mayfield. Mayfield and Walsh will scrimmage each other rather than play a real game.
 Chardon coach Mitch Hewitt said he still wanted to play Perry, but "it didn't work out." Part of the reason was likely that both Chardon and Perry have only four home games this year. In fact, Perry still hasn't filled the Week 2 slot, according to Coach Matt Rosati.

England forward Raheem Sterling said on Tuesday that "now is the time to act" against racism.
 Sterling has been speaking out amid the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests that followed the death of George Floyd while in police custody in the United States.
 The BLM protests have also led to renewed debate about the lack of black coaches and administrators within British sport.
 Sterling said that black people are "tired" and want to see meaningful action.
 "I feel like I speak for most black people, everyone is tired. With the protesting that is going on you see what is happening in America transferring to the UK," Manchester City star Sterling told Sky Sports.
 "A lot of people have been in silence and is using this opportunity as a moment to be one and try to get not just answers but changes to society.
 "It is something that is coming up a lot more which is a good thing. I truly do believe that now is the time that we have to act. I am doing my bit behind the scenes."
 Sterling's latest comments came a day after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a government review into "all aspects of inequality" following a wave of anti-racism protests in Britain.
 But David Lammy, justice spokesman for the main opposition Labour party said the review, one of several in recent years, was simply a device to delay meaningful action and appeared to have been "written on the back of a fag (cigarette) packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest".

NEW YORK -- Wall Street surged on Tuesday as a record jump in retail sales indicated the U.S. economy is on the road to recovery, five months into its pandemic-inflicted recession.
 All three major U.S. stock indexes were sharply higher, and on course for their third consecutive daily gains.
 The Dow and the S&P remain about 11% and 8% below their respective record closing highs reached in February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq hovers about 1% below its all-time closing high reached on June 10.
 Data released by the Commerce Department showed retail sales jumped by a record 17.7% in May, blowing past the 8% increase analysts expected.
 "We're seeing pretty broad gains," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "As the economy reopens, you're going to see strong numbers but after that they're going to peter out."
 "As (U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell pointed out, we have a long way to go," Cardillo added.
 Indeed, at the beginning of his two-day testimony before Congress, Powell said, "Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely."
 With a resurgence of new COVID-19 cases in China and the United States, along with unabated progression of the pandemic in Latin America and elsewhere, it could take a while until that confidence finds a foothold.
 But a UK-led drug trial showed low doses of generic steroid drug dexamethasone reduced COVID-19 death rates among the most severe cases.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 577.73 points, or 2.24%, to 26,340.89, the S&P 500 gained 64.83 points, or 2.11%, to 3,131.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 181.65 points, or 1.87%, to 9,907.67.
 All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 were well in the black, with healthcare leading the charge.
 The upbeat retail sales data helped push S&P 500's Retail index 2.3% higher, led by Nordstrom Inc and Kohl's Corp, which surged by 14.9% and 7.7%, respectively.
 Blue-chip industrial Caterpillar Inc jumped 5.1% while planemaker Boeing Co advanced 3.1%.
 Shares of Eli Lilly and Co surged 16.4% after announcing its breast cancer therapy's success in a late-stage study.
 Oracle Corp was up 2.8% after Wells Fargo hiked its price target on the company's shares ahead of its earnings release expected after the bell.
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.35-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
 The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 96 new highs and five new lows. (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)

FRANKFURT -- The unlisted biotech firm CureVac will become the second company to launch human trials of an experimental coronavirus vaccine in Germany, two people familiar with the plans told Reuters on Tuesday.
 The clinical trial, to be announced on Wednesday, is the second to be approved by Germany's vaccines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, after a trial by BioNTech that began in April.
 CureVac and the Paul Ehrlich Institute declined to comment.
 The World Health Organization lists 11 experimental coronavirus vaccines as currently being tested on humans, according to a table posted on its website.
 The German government on Monday unveiled a deal to take an agreed 23% stake in CureVac for a cash injection of 300 million euros ($338 million).
 Later that day, a finance ministry document seen by Reuters showed that the firm - controlled by SAP co-founder Dietmar Hopp - plans an initial public offering in the United States next month.
 Germany and partner countries in the European Union last week pledged funds for the production of an experimental vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca , saying they needed to spread their bets across several more candidates.
 Britain and the United States had previously made commitments to secure hundreds of millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is based on so-called viral vector technology, as developers across the world prepare to produce even before their candidates are shown to work in trials.
 Media reports in March that the United States had tried to gain access to CureVac or its vaccine stirred a political backlash in Germany, where members of the government called for it to remain German-owned.
 CureVac's management has denied receiving offers from the United States.
 The company, which is based in Tuebingen and backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is using the so-called messenger RNA approach, like BioNTech and its partner Pfizer as well as Moderna.

The criminal offenses occurred during the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years when the victims were 17 and 18, according to court records.
 Polizzi had a hearing with the professional conduct board in December 2019. The board released its recommendation June 12.
 Polizzi told the board during that hearing that someone reported him to the school’s superintendent after being caught off of school property with the second victim. Polizzi told the board that in his conversation with the superintendent, he admitted that he had met the victim. The superintendent told him that his contract would not be renewed. Polizzi admitted to the board that he was not honest with the superintendent about having sexual contact with the victims.
 The North Royalton resident did not face legal consequences until years later. He finished his law degree in the interim and worked for three years at a law firm as a personal injury attorney.
 Willoughby Hills police began an investigation into Polizzi after one of his victims came forward. During the course of the investigation, a second was identified.
 One of the victims said in court she never planned on turning him in until he sent her a “filthy” email out of the blue two years after they broke things off. That email triggered something in her that made her determined to get justice.

Frankie Dettori said he required an espresso or two to pump himself up because of the flat atmosphere with no spectators allowed at Royal Ascot due to the coronvavirus pandemic.
 The 49-year-old Italian riding legend managed to get off the mark on the first day on Tuesday with Frankly Darling in the Ribblesdale Stakes, giving his friend John Gosden his 50th winner at the meeting.
 Dettori -- who took his own tally to 68 -- said he had found it very hard to get enthused without the usual buzz of thronging crowds trying to get close to the biggest drawcard in the sport.
 "Before the first race, it was very hard to pick myself up," he said after riding Frankly Darling.
 "I usually walk in and am signing autographs, everybody is slapping me on the back and shouting my name. It was the opposite today.
 "I think I had to have two or three espressos to get me going for the first race.
 "But now the adrenaline is pumping."
 The adrenaline was clearly flowing as Dettori performed his trademark flying dismount.
 "Of course we miss the crowd, but we are putting on a show for the people watching at home who are enjoying the races," he said.
 "It was very hard to get going for the first race and a lot of the lads were quiet.
 "I wasn't going to do a flying dismount, but ITV (the broadcaster) asked me to do it and it's not the same without me doing a flying dismount.
 "There's no crowd, but it's still Royal Ascot and I thought I should still celebrate in style."
 Gosden -- who received a saddle cloth with 50 marked on it from Dettori at the presentation -- said Ascot could be an unforgiving environment.
 "I can remember during this week scrambling one winner, one year having no winners, having six seconds and finally a winner one year," he said.
 "Look, it is not an easy place to win races."
 \- 'People losing jobs' -
 Gosden -- who was to have winner number 51 with Nazeef in the penultimate race the Duke of Cambridge Stakes -- said it was important the iconic meeting took place even without spectators.
 "It is Royal Ascot," he said. "I think it is a huge achievement.
 "This country and many countries in the world have suffered horribly from this sinister disease -- it has been devastating.
 "Everything that people are going through, let alone the destruction of our economies and people losing jobs -- it is a worldwide problem.
 "It (Ascot) is a very safe place to be and it's lovely to put on top-quality sport with the best racehorses in Europe, great athletes and great jockeys.
 "We understand that it is a financial blow for the racecourses, but we are putting a show on and it's great that it's going out."
 Dettori paid a handsome tribute to 69-year-old Gosden, who has on two occasions handed him a lifeline when his career has been at a crossroads.
 "John is amazing," said Dettori.
 "We have a lot of horses running this week. Stradivarius is going for a third Gold Cup.
 "We have got amazing owners and it is a pleasure to ride for him. He gives me a tremendous amount of confidence.
 "He is a good boss and a good friend."

He has a bachelor of arts in sociology and urban studies from Cleveland State University, and a masters in community planning, economic development from the University of Cincinnati. He is married and has a son.
 “I’m going to treat Virginia Beach as if it is my family,” Duhaney said at the meeting via live video. “I’m going to honor it and treat it with integrity, and be as open and transparent as possible in my dealings to ensure that everybody gets a sense of how the city is operating.”
 Councilman John Moss and Councilwoman Barbara Henley voted against his contract. Henley said she didn’t have input on the contract or its provisions and couldn’t support it.
 “This compensation exceeds my standard of public service,” Moss said.
 Virginia Beach received 169 applications for the position and interviewed candidates in June.
 “I’m really excited to have you on board,” Councilman Aaron Rouse told Duhaney.
 Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley in an email to Duhaney obtained by The Virginian-Pilot had high praise for the city manager.
 "Impeccable integrity and constant professionalism, you are a servant leader that is able to lead by moral force and conviction-based resolve,” wrote Cranley. “Cincinnati will emerge from our trifecta of crises (pandemic, racial injustice and budget crisis) because of your amazing hard work and effectiveness.”

 As a reporter for _Maharashtra Times_ , he came to be known for his frontline war reporting during the Bangladesh war in 1970-71, during which he trekked on foot to the rural areas around Chittagong. Once again, in 1982, when Maharashtra went through the throes of the ‘cement scandal’, Ranadive excelled with a series of breaking stories that exposed then chief minister A.R. Antulay, and kept the State on the boil. He retired from service as chief reporter of the _Maharashta Times_ in the late 1980s.
 Ranadive’s activism and pledge towards journalism was such that late Arun Sadhu’s iconic Marathi novel _Sinhasan_ had a central character based on him. Jabbar Patel directed a movie of the similar name and veteran actor late Nilu Phule played the role of Digu Tipnis, based on real life of Dinu Ranadive.
 He was recently conferred with Mumbai Press Club’s Red Ink award for Lifetime Achievement. “With the passing of Dinu Ranadive, a voice of the downtrodden and poor was lost,” said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
 For many, he has been a friend, philosopher and a guide and also a person with treasure of resources. “When I met him as a cub-reporter in 2007, he told me about how he started a series on people living on footpaths in Mumbai at night. He used to walk across the city on foot to meet and write on the lives of these people. It was a tough lesson for a budding journalist like me,” said Amey Tirodkar, a journalist working in Mumbai.
 “A socialist by heart and an activist in reality. Dinu Ranadive was a part of every struggle for justice, be it samyukta Maharashtra or mill workers’ strike. He reported it and also ensured his participation. He did not hide behind the curtain of objectivity,” said social activist Subodh More.

"I feel like I now know the frustrations and struggles of the inventor Thomas Edison," Takagi told The Indian Express. "It was a fruitful experiment, but the issues we were able to identify were numerous, such as the microphones picking up and streaming the sounds of a fan slurping noodles! At the end of the day, no matter what we do, there is an element of dependence on fans being mindful of manners for the sake of everyone else."

Paper money errors have always been popular with collectors. On obsolete notes, however, they are surprisingly few and far between.
 The ones I see most often are so-called paper void printing errors where the sheet was folded prior to printing, leaving a blank area or void underneath the foldover.
 One "error" that collectors, if unfamiliar with the workings of the note issuing process for the State Bank of Indiana (1834 to 1859), often seize upon is that of "mismatched" serial numbers on the notes.
 Take for example the extremely rare genuine $1 note from the Madison Branch of the State Bank of Indiana illustrated above. The note sports serial numbers 5509 and 37709; obviously a blunder, right?

WarnerMedia has removed “Gone With the Wind” from its new streaming platform, HBO Max. AFI ranked the film No. 6 among the 100 Best Movies of All Time. The 1939 David O. Selznick-produced film not only won a bunch of Oscars, it also led to the first Academy Award for an African American actor, Hattie McDaniel. She played Mammy, a stereotypical maid role common to her era.
 The shelving of "GWTW" at the urging of another Academy Award winner, director and screenwriter John Ridley ("12 Years a Slave"), is happening for good reason: "It doesn't just 'fall short' with regard to representation," he pointed out in an op-ed in this newspaper. "When it is not ignoring the horrors of slavery, ["Gone With the Wind"] pauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color."

You have electives for a reason. Make the most of them by taking classes that you normally wouldn’t sign up for. Try your hand at different types of engineering courses to gain an understanding of how different engineers approach and resolve questions and issues. You should also step out of the sciences altogether and take classes in other departments. You can learn a lot of valuable information and skills from other fields. For example, writing courses can improve how you develop and communicate ideas both on paper and with your peers.

To become law, the bill's supporters argue it would only have to pass both chambers of Congress with a simple majority and then be signed by the President. Because the legislation essentially shrinks the US capital to a tract of land including the White House, Capitol building, Supreme Court, and nearby federal buildings and monuments in the city, proponents say this would sidestep constitutional questions about making the rest of DC a state. Republicans, who oppose DC statehood, maintain that adding the district as a state would require a constitutional amendment.
