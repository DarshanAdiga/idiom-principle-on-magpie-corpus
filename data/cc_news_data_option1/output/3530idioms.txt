The Reserve Bank on September 5 came up with revised long format audit report (LFAR) norms with a view to improving efficacy of internal audit and risk management systems. The LFAR, which applies to statutory central auditors (SCA) and branch auditors of banks, has been updated keeping in view the large scale changes in the size, complexities, business model and risks in the banking operations, the RBI said.
 The revised LFAR format will be put into operation for the period covering 2020-21 and onwards, the central bank said. "The overall objective of the LFAR should be to identify and assess the gaps and vulnerable areas in the business operations, risk management, compliance and the efficacy of internal audit and provide an independent opinion on the same to the Board of the bank and provide their observations," the RBI said.
 While issuing the revised norms, the RBI asked the banks to ensure timely receipt of the LFAR from auditors. It further said that the LFAR should be placed before the Audit Committee of Board and Local Advisory Board of the bank indicating the action taken or proposed to be taken for rectification of the irregularities.

Ai quali non dovremmo imporre tutte le responsabilità. Ho visto la nazionale ieri sera e ho pensato a tutti gli articoli che ho letto durante il lockdown: sembrava che potessimo vincere l'Europeo.

The Asian flu, H2N2, never really reached here from East Asia in 1957, H3N2 killed around a million globally during 1968, though mostly in America, and half a million died during the 2011 H1N1 outbreak, again mainly in the states. So, most of us have never, genuinely, been forced into a punitive situation that has required governments to take what are sometimes drastic and draconian looking action, to save us from ourselves really. COVID-19 broke all the rules! The main issues that face researchers are clearly a lack of defined etymology for COVID-19, as unlike every other pandemic outbreak, where the origins have informed scientific and medicinal responses, the Wuhan based origins appear to be of the smoke and mirrors variety, the consequence of a national unwillingness to accept any blame or responsibility for the outbreak, to provide full and frank disclosures, in fact to obfuscate where possible.

I really was rooting for the guy, he seems to be a pretty stand-up person and an inspiration as well as very athletic. Unfortunately, at the end of the day he just didn't quite have the skill-set and/or size to make it work at this level. Maybe another team can find a role for him…I really hope so.

Harlequins boss Paul Gustard admitted the 41-27 defeat by Bath was a blow to everyone connected with staging the Gallagher Premiership’s first test event.
 A total crowd of 3,500 that included 2,700 fans gathered at Twickenham Stoop as a successful pilot for rugby following the five-month interruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Quins made a blistering start and scored a try through centre Joe Marchant, but once Ruaridh McConnochie ran in the first of his two touchdowns, they faded from contention.
 “I’m sad for the board, I’m sad for the club and I’m sad for the fans, but also I’m massively sad for the team because they weren’t able to put the performance in,” head of rugby Gustard said.
 “I’m disappointed with the performance. It’s sad that we had 3,500 people in here but didn’t get the result we want.
 “From the point of view of normality, it was great to see a crowd back. For the first 20 minutes we gave them something to cheer about, for the next 50 we didn’t.
 “Making the top four seems very tough now. The top four are pulling away now and leaving people like ourselves behind.”
 Bath director of rugby Stuart Hooper hopes the event in south west London heralds the return of fans at grounds across the league.
 “It’s imperative to get fans back as soon as possible and as safely as possible. It felt exciting,” Hooper said.
 “To see and hear supporters and to feel the excitement build around the stadium was a big step forward. As soon as we can get it done safely around the country, then let’s get it done.”
 McConnochie produced a classy finish in each half to propel Bath out of sight in a one-sided bonus-point victory that was effectively over two minutes into the second half once the England wing had scored his second.
 Eddie Jones was watching from the stands and could add to the former seven specialist’s two caps won during England’s autumn campaign last year.
 “The first try was just reward for chasing the kick. Often those go unnoticed but he does so much unseen work it’s incredible,” Hooper said.
 “The second try was class. It was quality because he takes the ball in very little space on the left and dances his way down the touchline.
 “But you also see his little step at the end for the finish. It was very calm and at the moment he’s on fire.
 “Ruaridh loves playing for Bath and giving a good account of himself. If he keeps doing that he’ll definitely play for England again.”

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Voting will look a little different this November. States are turning to stadiums, drive-thrus and possibly even movie theaters as safe options for in-person polling places amid the coronavirus pandemic and fears about mail-in ballots failing to arrive in time to count. The primary season brought voters to an outdoor wedding-style tent in Vermont and the state fairgrounds in Kentucky. The general election on Nov. 3 is expected to include voting at NBA arenas around the country, part of an agreement owners made with players to combat racial injustice. Large venues and outdoor spaces allow for social distancing that helps prevent the spread of the virus, though there are questions about keeping people warm as the weather gets cold and the possibility that fewer traditional neighborhood polling places could lower voter turnout.Election Day is expected to bring a surge in mail-in voting, but some people may feel more comfortable casting their ballots in person amid concerns about recent mail delays following a series of operational changes at the U.S. Postal Service and President Donald Trump stoking unfounded claims of voter fraud.Several states conduct their elections almost entirely by mail, and mail-in voting is well established in others. In June, Utah broke voter turnout records despite not opening traditional polling places because of the virus. In-person voting will be back in November, but rather than only using schools, churches and public buildings like usual, clerks also are permitted to set up drive-thru or outdoor polling places. The family that owns the NBA’s Utah Jazz also has a chain of movie theaters and offered three as voting sites in November. One suburban Salt Lake City county ran a primary polling place where voters drove through an indoor convention center to pick up their ballots, completed them in their cars and then dropped them off in an outdoor parking area. Davis County Clerk Curtis Koch said the system will be in place for the general election, too.Chad Berbert, a 46-year-old Republican, said he’ll probably vote by mail in the fall, but he’s glad officials are offering alternative voting methods. “The more options for voting in terms of mechanisms or ways that people can exercise their franchise I think is helpful,” said Berbert, who lives in Layton, Utah, and works at a management consulting firm. Less than 1% of Utah voters chose in-person options in June, according to election officials. But in states where voters are less familiar with mail-in voting, unorthodox in- person options will provide a safe alternative, said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.In Los Angeles, Dodger Stadium will be used as a vote center as part of a joint effort with More Than A Vote, a voting rights organization launched by LeBron James that’s dedicated to maximizing Black turnout in November. Many Black voters — one of the Democratic Party’s most important voting groups — are wary of voting by mail amid historical skepticism of a system that tried to keep Black people from the polls and worries that a mailed ballot won’t get counted.Several teams, including the Milwaukee Bucks, Detroit Pistons and Atlanta Hawks, had already committed their arenas to be voting sites prior to the NBA’s announcement last week. Madison Square Garden also will be among the sports stadiums used.The idea to use large spaces for in-person voting started in Kentucky, where Louisville’s only option in the June primary was an exposition center at the state fairgrounds. Organizers carefully laid out chalk markings where voters could safely stand in line, though there were complications as voters struggled to find parking at the end of the day. In Vermont, the tiny town of Lincoln voted during an August primary in a wedding- style tent, clerk Sally Ober said. Being outdoors in the summer gave Ober some unexpected brushes with nature. As she was setting up, she picked up a baby robin from the street and rescued a speckled fawn that got stuck on a fence. A toad also hopped through the tent during voting.“It was very funny and cute and sweet that wildlife was involved with our voting day,” Ober said.The primary set turnout records, largely driven by mail-in voting. All active Vermont voters will get a mail-in ballot for the November election, and lawmakers also have allowed for outdoor and drive-thru voting systems.In Lincoln, Ober is again preparing for people who want to vote in person. But in a state where below-freezing temperatures are normal for November, the tent likely won’t make another appearance. ___Associated Press writer Wilson Ring in Stowe, Vermont, contributed.

Britain’s singles stars were turning their thoughts to clay before the middle weekend of the US Open after a disappointing couple of days in New York.
 Four British men reached the second round for the first time since the mid-1970s but only Cameron Norrie went further, and he was unable to take advantage of a great opportunity to make round four.
 Defeats for Dan Evans and Johanna Konta against much-lower-ranked opponents were particularly disappointing, and that frustration was compounded by the fact both players, along with Norrie, failed to turn winning positions into victory.
 The results will once again focus attention on the health of British tennis, but former UK number one Tim Henman believes things need to be kept in perspective.
 Speaking on Amazon Prime, Henman said: “Let’s reflect on how many more opportunities and positives that there have been. You don’t need to (look) too far back, certainly to when Greg (Rusedski) and I were playing, and it was two of us.
 “The game in this country has got a long way to go, don’t get me wrong, but we’re trending in the right direction. There’s some healthy competition on both the men’s side and the women’s side.

PRIMAPRESS) - SIENA - Lucio Battisti, la voglia di viaggiare che fa ancora i conti con la pandemia e il superamento delle distanze sociali ha spinto la band senese Deschema ad arrangiare in chiave personale uno dei brani iconici del cantautore. Hanno chiamato a raccolta amici sparsi in ogni parte del mondo e li hanno riuniti in una sorta di lungo viaggio virtuale: nasce da questa idea il videoclip di “Si, Viaggiare”, successo intramontabile di Battisti.   Gianluca Polvere (Voce, Synth), Nicola Facco (Chitarra), Giulio Cappelli (Chitarra), Emilio Goracci (Basso) e Massimiliano Manetti (Batteria) scelgono un brano di uno degli artisti fondamentali nel loro percorso professionale, per augurare a ciascuno di noi di poter “ripartire” con il sorriso.   “Viaggiare negli ultimi mesi è mancato a tutti – commentano i componenti della band -Prendere l'auto e partire, salire su un bus, un treno, un aereo o camminare per strada era qualcosa che davamo per scontato ma, improvvisamente, tutto si è fermato. Dopo i difficili giorni di una quarantena che ha paralizzato il mondo, ci è sembrato opportuno rileggere il brano di Battisti per celebrare il poter viaggiare nuovamente. L’arrangiamento in chiave Deschema, regala alla canzone un tono di leggerezza che per noi era necessario dopo il lockdown e abbiamo chiesto ad alcuni dei nostri amici di regalarci il loro sorriso per affrontare con nuova speranza il prossimo futuro”.   E la leggerezza, la speranza e la voglia di tornare a stare insieme, sono la chiave di ispirazione del videoclip appena pubblicato che nasce grazie alla disponibilità e al coinvolgimento di tante persone che in Italia e nel resto del mondo seguono la band.   I Deschema ci offrono così il racconto di un viaggio fatto di musica, emozioni, amicizia che vuole rendere omaggio al genio senza tempo di Lucio Battisti e che vuole augurare che, quanto prima, si possa finalmente ritornare a una socialità libera da paure. - (PRIMAPRESS)

But after she'd carefully pulled away from the curb with the examiner as her co-pilot — left-hand directional on as is legally appropriate — I couldn't bear to move.
 I couldn't even bring myself to lift my gaze and follow the car from its starting position to the stop sign at the end of the street.
 Which way did they go after that? I couldn't say for sure.
 Instead, I would spend the next 15 minutes trying to pace a groove in the sidewalk, trudging back and forth from the camp chairs Mr. R.D. Testa had so thoughtfully placed, in the shade, to the fire hydrant 50 yards beyond, in the scorching sun.
 Why was I nervous?
 I wasn't the one in the driver's seat, navigating unfamiliar streets with a stranger strapped in beside me. Pleasant enough fellow though he was, it would be up to her to determine what the notes he was making on his tablet as he softly clucked his tongue actually meant for her chances of passing.
 I felt the centrifugal force of tension against my neck as I craned it toward each vehicle whooshing past the mouth of the roadway, tires grinding pebbles as they turned in and slowly made their way to be next in the lineup.
 I checked my watch. Twenty minutes had passed, and still no sign of them.
 Eventually, they would return. She would park the car, and there would be a long, silent moment where he spoke, and she looked stricken. His car door would open, and he would approach me to explain that while she did well, she did not do well enough to pass this time.
 It was the old conundrum of having to choose between taking a right as when the traffic light is yellow or stopping for all of eternity (or until the light turns green again) smack dab in the center of a crosswalk.

While this weekend may be an extended holiday vacation for many, the coronavirus will not take any breaks.
   
 That's the message Gov. Jared Polis as well as the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment is driving home heading into Labor Day Weekend, urging residents to be cautious while celebrating to avoid an uptick in numbers.
   
 Colorado's key COVID-19 numbers have been declining and are much better than many other states. This week, the state hit its lowest daily testing positivity rate yet at just under 2%. The positivity rate is the rate of positive test results out of the total number of COVID-19 tests administered.
   
 And local officials want to keep the state's numbers low.
   
 "Coloradans have met the challenges of this pandemic head on, and our numbers may be declining, but we are not out of the woods," Polis said during a press conference this week. "Cases spiked after the Fourth of July weekend and we can't let that happen again after Labor Day weekend."
   
 Our success thus far is due to each individual doing their part and we can't let up now. We need everyone, including all of our students who are back on campus, to take this seriously and act responsibly by avoiding large groups and parties and wearing a mask around others."
   
 Pueblo's health department leaders echoed what Polis had to say about the weekend.
   
 "Labor Day is traditionally a time where people get together for outdoor activities and barbecues to mark the unofficial end to summer, but it's important now more than ever, that people continue to follow local and state guidance to help prevent the further spread of COVID-19 in our community," Randy Evetts, public health director for the Pueblo health department, said.
   
 Evetts reminded residents that testing is encouraged for anyone experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, first responders, health care workers, critical infrastructure employees, teachers, and individuals who work in congregate settings.
   
 Testing will be available on Labor Day.
