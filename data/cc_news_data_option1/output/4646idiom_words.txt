 # Worcester colleges balk at idea of voluntary payment to city
 Scott O'Connell
 Telegram & Gazette
 WORCESTER – As the city mulls a potential push to get nonprofits to contribute a voluntary payment in lieu of taxes this year, one of the area’s largest nonprofit sectors – higher education – has said it is not interested.
 Through the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts, the city’s private colleges issued a statement this week saying they are facing their own struggles during the pandemic, including a steep loss in revenue due in part to their efforts to control COVID-19 transmission on their campuses.
 “HECCMA member colleges understand and are sensitive to the impact that COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, on the City of Worcester and its citizens,” the consortium’s statement said.
 But the organization said Worcester colleges have already paid nearly $9 million to the city this year, including $2.2 million in real estate taxes and $5.1 million in water and sewer fees. They’ve also provided a public service, they said, by running aggressive coronavirus testing programs on their campuses, limiting the spread of the virus in their neighborhoods.
 The City Council, however, earlier this week laid the groundwork for a potential measure that would ask those colleges – and other local nonprofits – to help offset the pandemic burden falling on taxpayers this year. Councilor- at-Large Gary Rosen, the lead sponsor of the order, said the city could ask them to make a special one-time payment, although it would have to be voluntary, since the local government can’t impose a property tax on nonprofits.
 Such financial contributions, known as a payment in lieu of taxes, have come up before as an idea in Worcester, but have never caught on.
 This year especially, colleges are not in the best standing to start giving money now, according to HECCMA’s director, Jeanine Went.
 “The higher education community wants to do their part to be good neighbors,” she said. “That said, there’s only so much that the colleges can do as we continue to face a global pandemic.”
 According to HECCMA, its member colleges are on track to have a combined deficit of $190 million by the end of the fiscal year because of the costs they’ve incurred from the coronavirus. The schools that have opened their campuses this fall have had to restrict their number of on-campus residents and cancel events to limit the spread of COVID, as well as spend millions of dollars on coronavirus testing for all students and staff. A few colleges, including Becker College and Holy Cross, elected this fall to keep their campuses mostly closed, and offer remote classes to students instead.
 According to Went, to afford to make a payment in lieu of taxes to the city, HECCMA’s member colleges “would have to reduce their contributions elsewhere.”
 Individual colleges reached by the Telegram & Gazette this week deferred comment on the matter to HECCMA.
 The private colleges represented by the consortium in Worcester include Assumption University, Becker, Clark University, Holy Cross, MCPHS University, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
