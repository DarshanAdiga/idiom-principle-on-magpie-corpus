“Within 16 hours they threw an entire wedding together, and it’s beautiful. I can’t ask for better,” she said. “At the end of the day we just wanted to get married and it was important that we did it in the church because that was important to our parents and our faith."           Speaking after the church service, her mother Linda Choate said it was beautiful.           “She just wanted to be absolutely perfect for her groom. It was very important for her that she did get married in the church and when that almost didn’t happen she was so distraught,” she said. “They asked ‘Father, can we please do this before you have to evacuate?’ and he said ‘today!’"          The groom, who could not stop smiling after the service, said he reassured his bride that it would all work out.           And it did.

THE ICONS of two North Coast towns have been engaged in something of a stoush.
 But Byron Bay has stepped in, urging both landmarks to “stop embarrassing themselves”.
 A heated back-and-forth arose after Coffs Harbour’s Big Banana was named the ‘Best Big Thing’ in the Wotif 2020 Uniquely Aussie Awards.
 The yellow monolith danced on the grave of its competition and it is understood this gave Ballina’s Big Prawn a wobbly lip.
 A sore loser as always, the Big Prawn responded with contempt.
 Byron Bay says both need to pause, take a sip of kombucha and accept they’re just the run-down icons of towns that have to flaunt their “big things” for attention.
 “I don’t need a big chunk of fibreglass to know my worth,” The Bay said.
 “With more than two million visitors a year, that should be obvious.
 “I accept I had a moment with that sculpture, which was, in its day, so big it blocked out the view of my real lighthouse from the Great Traffic Jam of Ewingsdale Rd.
 “But I saw the error of my ways soon enough and now pieces of the disco dong gone wrong are adorning front doors, used as bottle openers, you name it. I don’t need to shove it in your face because I’m genuinely appealing.”
 Adding sea salt to their wounds, The Bay claimed the Banana and Prawn were “completely useless” beyond the “depressingly dull happy snaps” they feature in.
 “I’m all for instagrammable vistas; I created them,” The Bay said, sipping a margarita.
 “Who do you think is the brains behind our digital influencers?
 “But these guys are trying too hard.
 “Their bitterness is understandable. I’d hate to be the kind of place you only stop because you’re on a road trip, on the way to some place better, and your kids need to pee.
 “Sure, Ballina has an airport but people only fly there because my name’s on the door.
 “Coffs has an island with cute birds but these days, who doesn’t? You can buy half of Coffs for the cost of a granny flat in Byron.
 “My real big lighthouse – which has saved lives and doubles as a night-time disco aura – is on a headland that’s further east and therefore far superior to any other in Australia.
 “I have more yogis and anti-vaxxers than both of you combined and my cocaine market is off the charts.
 “I know how to evolve. I was a whaling town but I’ve grown to be so green even the Greens argue about who’s green enough.”
 The Bay said its counterparts would “never achieve anything close to Byron’s Hollywood glamour” with “tacky statues of food scraps”.
 “If you’re going to flex, you’d better be able to stand up against our cohort of Hemsworths,” it said.
 “Perhaps I can help the Banana and Prawn to practise mindfulness, so they could be mindful of their rightful place at the bottom of this food chain.
 The Banana and Prawn were contacted for comment but both simply sobbed down the line.

SPEEDING offences, negligent driving, high-range drink drivers, infringement notices and warnings were the result of Richmond Police officers patrolling Northern Rivers beaches over the last two weeks.
 In this most recent school holiday period, Seven Mile Beach, Airforce Beach and South Ballina Beach was patrolled with the use of our all-terrain vehicles, with numerous community interactions taking place.
 As a result of those patrols, police issued 25 warnings for various offences and 50 infringement notices issued for dogs in prohibited zones, speed offences, driving offences including being above the high tide area and dunes.
 During the blitz, police also conducted 150 random breath tests, with one low range and one high range result detected.
 The operation also identified six negligent driving offences (eg fish tailing and burnouts on sand), the issuing of seven move-on directions from beach areas issued, one bike helmet offence and six speeding offences.
 Detective Acting Inspector Grant Erickson, Richmond Police District Crime Manager said
 the aim of these patrols and operations was to ensure a safe environment for holiday makers and beach goers on our coastal strips, while giving the local residents confidence that their beaches are monitored and safe.
 “Richmond Police District conduct regular high-visibility patrols throughout the region, including along our coastline to target anti-social behaviour and traffic offences upon our beaches,” he said.
 “The community’s response to our engagements was overwhelming positive and appreciative for our presence.
 “These joint agency operations are ongoing and will be a regular occurrence during the upcoming summer months, with police working with local councils and NSW Surf Lifesaving to observe social distancing on our beaches.”
 During these operations, local police are supported by councils, National Parks and Wildlife, NSW Maritime and other agencies to enforce the relevant legislation and regulations on our beaches.

A nationwide program that for months saw the government pay 80% of the salaries of furloughed workers has helped keep a lid on unemployment but is ending at the end of October. That program will be replaced by the less generous Jobs Support Scheme, which will see the government pay up to 22% of wages for workers who return to work from their furlough from Nov. 1.

 "(The recapitalisation plan) sets up Rolls-Royce sufficiently to navigate an uncertain recovery and removes any lingering concerns about liquidity - and even solvency," said Berenberg analyst Andrew Gollan, keeping a "buy" rating on the stock.
 Worries over a long-haul travel slump reduced Rolls Royce's market value to just 3.8 billion pounds (US$4.9 billion) from 20.5 billion pounds two years back.
 "There is a clear willingness to go bargain hunting as traders begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG.

Gardner declined to meet with The Denver Post editorial board for our endorsement process.
