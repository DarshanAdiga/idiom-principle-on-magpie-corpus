Blossom arrived at the sanctuary with her sister Holly when they were 8 months old.
 “Holly, along with Blossom, ... was rescued from very poor conditions. Both were suffering from malnutrition. They had lice and worms,” the sanctuary website says. “Blossom was in a far worse state than her sister, Holly. Blossom could not even walk when she arrived at the farm. It was touch and go for awhile.
 “Slowly, but surely, Blossom began to recover after receiving therapy for her legs, as well as lots of love and support.”

 With the coronavirus still a concern for many, social distancing and masks have been encouraged for wear at the voting polls.

 Information on what forms of identification as well as polling information such as key dates, times, and locations should be available on the Secretary of State's website or at GoVoteTN.com.
 Voting information could be helpful in creating a voting plan if you do not already have one.

Companies that use corrupt influence instead of competing in a fair, ethical, and honest manner should take note of today's agreement: paying bribes to obtain and retain business is not business as usual, it is a crime, Rabbitt said in a statement.
 U.S. companies that attempt to gain the upper hand in foreign business ventures by engaging in corruption must be held accountable, said U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. for the Northern District of Illinois. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has a long reach, and for good reason. It is critical that our global economy remain on a fair playing field.
 The Department of Justice press release did not name the Indian official or officials who allegedly received the bribes.
 The bribe was authorised by a high-ranking executive at Beam's Asia Pacific/South America regional business unit, who directed that the payment be made through Beam India's third-party bottler in order to conceal it, the DoJ alleged.

The Tigers will play in Cedar Rapids for the second straight year, the third time in four seasons and for the seventh time in the past 11 years. Each of the last seven have been under the leadership of Montgomery.
 “I’m proud of every single team that I have coached,” she said. “These girls were laser-focused. First, they were the underdog that everybody kind of counted out, and that escaped us pretty quick after the win against Glenwood. You started to see them believe a little bit more, too.”
 This particular season has hardly been a surprise for those within the Red Oak program, but there were plenty of questions marks with the graduation of a highly successful senior class. Coach Montgomery says the move of Jones to libero and DeVries into the lone setter within the offense solidified the team.
 “The credit goes to those kids,” she said. “Abbey has trained to be a libero for years. She was focused on ending her senior season in that black jersey. It has worked, and those two are huge leaders for us and reasons we’re so successful.”
 “I felt this year I could move (to libero) and do really great,” Jones said. “I feel the team helped me out so much, and our hitters have stepped up so much.”
 The No. 9 ranked and seventh-seeded Tigers will play a 3A state quarterfinal match next Monday evening at 8:00 PM against No. 2 Clarion-Goldfield-Dows.
 “It’s going to be a tough tournament for anyone,” Montgomery said. “I think people will overlook us, but this team is dangerous. I’m sure excited to get to state and see what they can do. Why can’t it be us?”

SAN DIEGO (CNS) - The San Diego County Board of Supervisors Tuesday, Oct. 27 unanimously approved a resolution asking the state governor's office for more local control when it comes to further restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Proposed by Supervisors Jim Desmond and Kristin Gaspar, the resolution was approved after board members received an update on the county's efforts on combating the virus.
 According to the resolution, the county is requesting that ``the state continues to regularly consult and incorporate the expertise and judgment of local health officers in the determinations for the most effective non- pharmaceutical interventions in local jurisdictions.''
 Further, ``the state's reopening blueprint must account for hospital and medical system capacity and readiness to provide medical treatment by incorporating data into the analysis in some manner, such as case rate readjustment factor,'' the resolution states.
 Desmond said county officials should be able to determine measures to contain the virus.
 ``We continue to be stuck in the red tier, and our businesses continue to suffer,'' said Desmond, who has frequently criticized state restrictions under the four-tiered color-coded system, but he also praised the county's public health staff for their efforts.
 ``I realize we've sent letters in the past, but we have to keep knocking until that door opens,'' Desmond said, adding that the county has the appropriate testing capacity and personal protection equipment.
 Dr. Wilma Wooten, county public health officer, updated the board on the county's case rate, which stands at 54,941. As of Tuesday, there have been 870 deaths from the coronavirus, with 892 in intensive care units and 3,859 hospitalized.
 The county remains in the red tier, Wooten said, but can progress to less restrictive tiers if residents continue preventive measures, such as masks and social distancing.
 ``Please remember how far we have come, and where we do not want to return,'' she said. ``We want to avoid moving to tier one, or the purple tier.''
 Wooten also thanked the public for working to keep the county ``healthy, safe and thriving.''
 Gaspar said the county needs to reopen public youth sporting efforts, as children are suffering from a lack of activities.
 ``Kids have received the least amount of consideration during this pandemic,'' Gaspar said, adding the state has been silent on youth sports reopening.
 She said that families are taking their children to Arizona or Nevada for tournaments, where there are fewer restrictions, but that also carries risk.
 ``It's preferable to keep them here for play,'' Gaspar said.
 Along with approving the resolution, the board also voted 4-1 to green-light roughly $37 million for numerous capital improvement projects that were put on hold in May due to the pandemic.
 Ebony Shelton, deputy chief administrative officer, said county staff recommended allowing the projects to move forward.
 Citing concerns over the lack of future federal stimulus, Supervisor Nathan Fletcher was the lone no vote.
 The county has received more than $300 million from the federal CARES Act to help with everything from small business grants to better testing.
 ``Most updates are benign, but I'm surprised we'd put capital improvement projects in a COVID update,'' Fletcher said.
 Fletcher said while he loves parks, this isn't the right time to approve more money for building them.
 He reminded board members that the county was just two months away from all federal money expiring, and ``there's disparity in which communities are suffering the most.''
 Supervisor Dianne Jacob said that while she agreed with Fletcher on the funding request being included in the regular update, the projects are funded with previous board support.
 ``I see no reason not to move forward on these,'' Jacob added. ``Every one of these projects is going to put people to work and create jobs.''

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. — Nick Taylor never has been to the Masters. He already is motivated to get back.
 Taylor is excited to be playing Augusta National in two weeks, make no mistake about that. The 32-year-old Canadian has only watched on television, often enough to have a good idea what to expect. That’s what tempers some of the anticipation about his Masters debut.
 He has seen it enough to know what he’ll be missing.
 “When I won, you think of the Masters and what it’s going to be,” Taylor said. “And it’s not going to be that.”
 No spring colors from the dogwoods and azaleas. The Par 3 Contest has been canceled. The patrons will be at home, the same place Taylor has been all these years. That means no roars that echo through Georgia pines, as much a part of Masters lore as the green jacket.
 For those who think Augusta National is the cathedral of golf, it probably will sound like one. The Masters without roars? That’s like having the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade without balloons.
 Taylor is among 26 newcomers to the Masters, postponed from the first full week of April to Nov. 12-15 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Nine of those players, such as PGA champion Collin Morikawa, already have secured spots for the next Masters, presumably in April.
 There is no guarantee when the others will return, if they do.
 Taylor won as a rookie in 2014 at the Sanderson Farms Championship when it was the same week as the World Golf Championship in Shanghai and did not come with a Masters invitation. He finally earned his invitation in February, playing with five-time champion Phil Mickelson at Pebble Beach and posting a 70 in blustery conditions to win by four.
 “To get that invite for the Masters, that’s a tournament I’ve dreamt about playing my entire life,” Taylor said that day.
 More than a month later, the pandemic shut down golf. The Masters was postponed until November. Then came the announcement in August it would be held without fans.
 The anticipation is different now from what it was in February.
 “I was two months away from all the perks, maybe going before (the Masters) to see it,” Taylor said. “Now, all the news we’ve heard about it is a downer. No fans. No Par 3. It’s hard to compare. It’s not that I’m not excited, but certain aspects make it a special week, especially having never been there before. To not have those only makes me want to go back.”
 Taylor is thankful to be playing again, like so many others. This is the 21st consecutive week of PGA Tour golf, with no shutdown, no slashing of prize money and no fans, no energy. For a sport that sees something new every week — Winged Foot, Shadow Creek, Port Royal this week in Bermuda — there is a sameness to each week without anyone watching.
 Now, the Masters.
 “It’s easy to get negative about what’s going on the world,” he said. “But we’re playing golf. The reality check when we’re out there is how fortunate we are. We have our jobs. Everyone in my bubble is healthy. But when you think about what could have been at the Masters, it can get disappointing.”
 Tyler Duncan knows the feeling.
 He won the RSM Classic at Sea Island in November 2019, beating Webb Simpson in a playoff, and he received his formal Masters invitation in the mail soon after.
 When the Florida swing arrived, Duncan called Augusta National and arranged for a practice round. His plan was to go there on the Monday after The Players Championship.
 Golf shut down on Friday of The Players.
 “That didn’t work out,” Duncan said with a wry smile. “And then the course is shut down all summer. Now they’re trying to limit play, and you have to play with a member. I’ve been trying to do that but haven’t had a whole lot of success. We’ll show up and figure it out from there.”
 Asked what he think he would miss the most, the azaleas or the noise, Duncan didn’t hesitate.
 “The noise, for sure,” he said. “I’ve watched it so many times. A lot of shots come to mind, and you think of that. But you hear all the roars on the back nine where the tournament is won.”
 He doesn’t know anything about Washington Road. He didn’t know John Daly sold merchandise from an RV parked outside Hooters. Duncan won’t know all he’s missing.
 “It’s still the Masters,” he said. “It’s a tournament everyone dreams of playing.”
 Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player will be hitting the ceremonial tee shot without people standing a dozen deep around the tee trying to hear what they say. The starter will announce each player with that familiar, “Fore, please.” There’s still a green jacket everyone covets.
 But it won’t be the same. It won’t sound the same.
 They’re still going to the Masters. And then the goal is to come back to experience the real Masters.

ARLINGTON, Texas — No dogpile, no champagne and a mask on almost every face — the Los Angeles Dodgers celebrated their first World Series title since 1988 in a manner no one could have imagined before the coronavirus pandemic.
 They started the party without Justin Turner too, after their red-headed star received a positive COVID-19 test in the middle of their clinching victory.
 Turner was removed from Los Angeles’ 3-1 victory Tuesday against the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 6 after registering Major League Baseball’s first positive test in 59 days and wasn’t initially on the field as the Dodgers enjoyed the spoils of a title earned during a most unusual season.
 He returned about an hour after the game, hugging longtime teammate Clayton Kershaw and sitting front-and-center for a team photo next to manager Dave Roberts with his mask pulled down under his bushy beard.
 “Thanks to everyone reaching out!,” Turner said on Twitter. “I feel great, no symptoms at all. Just experienced every emotion you can possibly imagine. Can’t believe I couldn’t be out there to celebrate with my guys! So proud of this team & unbelievably happy for the City of LA.”
 Major League Baseball insulated postseason teams in neutral-site bubbles after traveling them across the country during a shortened 60-game season. Turner was the first player since the playoffs began to be flagged for the coronavirus.
 MLB received Turner’s sample from Monday from the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Utah in the bottom of the second inning, when lab president Dr. Daniel Eichner called deputy commissioner Dan Halem, who was in New York, a person familiar with the call said, speaking on condition of anonymity because details were not released.
 Eichner told Halem the result was inconclusive. MLB receives many inconclusive results, so Halem told Eichner to run the pregame sample from Turner. That result came back positive in the sixth inning, the person said.
 Halem called Chris Young, MLB’s senior vice president of baseball operations, who was in comissioner Rob Manfred’s box at Globe Life Field, then called Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. Friedman notified the dugout or clubhouse, and Turner was removed from the game after the seventh inning.
 The 35-year-old Turner has been a staple in the Dodgers’ lineup for seven of their eight consecutive National League West Division titles. A late-blooming slugger who helped reshape the game by succeeding with an upper-cut swing, Turner is the team’s career leader with 12 postseason home runs, including a pair in this Series, in which he hit .364 and also played stellar defense.
 “It’s gut-wrenching,” World Series MVP Corey Seager said. “If I could switch places with him right now, I would. That’s just not right.”
 Manfred confirmed Turner’s positive test moments after presenting the World Series trophy to Los Angeles — a jarring reminder of all that’s been different in this season where the perennially favored Dodgers finally broke through.
 Mookie Betts, who came to the Dodgers to make a World Series difference, had a mad dash to home plate in the sixth inning to put Los Angeles over the top.
 It was the end of a frustrating championship drought for L.A. — and perhaps just the start for Betts and the Dodgers, whose seventh World Series title was their sixth since leaving Brooklyn to the West Coast in 1958.
 “I had a crazy feeling that came to fruition,” Roberts said. “It’s just a special group of players, organization, all that we’ve kind of overcome.”
 Betts bolted from third for the go-ahead run on Seager’s infield grounder, then led off the eighth with a punctuating homer.
 “It was absolutely phenomenal. This team was incredible,” said Seager, also the NLCS MVP who had franchise records with his eight homers and 20 RBI this postseason. “We never stopped. We were ready to go as soon as the bell was called. Once it did, we kept rolling. You can’t say enough about what we did this season.”
 Kershaw was warming in the bullpen when Julio Urías struck out Willy Adames to end it and ran alongside teammates to celebrate in the infield, later joined by family who had been in the bubble with them in North Texas.
 Players were handed face masks as they gathered, although many of their embraces came mask-free even after Turner’s positive test.
 The Dodgers had played 5,014 regular-season games and were in their 114th postseason game since Orel Hershiser struck out Oakland’s Tony Phillips for the final out of the World Series in 1988, the same year Kershaw — the three- time NL Cy Young Award winner who won Games 1 and 5 of this Series — was born in nearby Dallas.
 Los Angeles had come up short in the World Series twice in the previous three years. Betts was on the other side two years ago and homered in the clinching Game 5 for the Boston Red Sox, who before this season traded the 2018 AL MVP to the Dodgers. They later gave him a $365 million, 12-year deal that goes until he turns 40 in 2032.
 Betts’ 3.2-second sprint was just enough to beat the throw by first baseman Ji-Man Choi, pushing Los Angeles ahead 2-1 moments after Rays manager Kevin Cash pulled ace left-hander Blake Snell despite a dominant performance in 5 innings.
 “I’m not exactly sure why,” Betts said when asked about the move. “I’m not going to ask any questions. He was pitching a great game.”
 Snell struck out nine — including the first time all season Betts, Seager and Turner each struck out in their first two at-bats. But the 2018 American League Cy Young Award winner didn’t see the top three batters in the Dodgers lineup a third time.
 “The only motive was the lineup the Dodgers feature is as potent as any team in the league,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “Mookie coming around for the third time through, I value that. I totally respect and understand the questions that come with it. They’re not easy decisions.”
 The Dodgers leadoff hitter had a .531 OPS against lefties this season, compared to 1.061 versus right-handers.
 Randy Arozarena, the powerful Tampa Bay rookie, extended his postseason record with his 10th homer in the first off rookie right-hander Tony Gonsolin, the first of seven Dodgers pitchers. The Rays never got another runner past second base as LA’s bullpen gave reliever-reliant Tampa Bay a taste of its own medicine in allowing only two hits and no walks in 7 innings.
 About 2½ weeks after the Lakers won the NBA title finishing their season in the NBA bubble in Orlando, Florida, the Dodgers gave Los Angeles another championship in this year when the novel coronavirus pandemic has delayed, shortened and moved around sports seasons.
 The MLB season didn’t start until late July and was abbreviated for the shortest regular season since 1878. And the expanded postseason, with 16 teams making it instead of 10, almost went the full distance.
 It ended when Urías got the final two Tampa Bay batters out on called third strikes — the 15th and 16th Ks by the Rays, with catcher Austin Barnes stuffing the last pitch in his back pocket. Along with the 11 strikeouts by the Dodgers, it was the most combined strikeouts in a nine-inning World Series game.
 Chants of “M-V-P!, M-V-P!” broke out when Betts hit his double in the sixth against reliever Nick Anderson, who allowed runs in seven consecutive relief appearances, the longest streak in MLB postseason history.
 Those chants got louder — even with the a limited crowd of 11,437 — when Betts went deep on an 0-2 pitch by hard-throwing right-hander Pete Fairbanks.
 There were plenty of fans in Dodgers blue at the new $1.2 billion home of the Texas Rangers, the stadium with the retractable roof where they played 16 games in three weeks. And the roof was closed for the final one, with misty conditions and a game-time temperature of 39 degrees outside.
 Los Angeles was home team for the final game of the season, like in the 2017 World Series when the Houston Astros won Game 7 at Dodger Stadium, and two years ago against the Red Sox.
 “This year has been crazy, but no matter what, we’ll look back on this and we’re World Series champs. To get to say that and get to be part of that, it’s so special no matter what,” Kershaw said. “The only thing that may have made it better would be to be at Dodger Stadium.”

A legislative compensation committee took steps Tuesday to limit per diem pay for lawmakers, in the event the 2021 session is interrupted by a COVID-19 outbreak.
 The move was requested by House Speaker Scott Bedke, R-Oakley, based on conversations he’s had with his counterparts in other Western states.
 “The item I want to bring up for your considerations (was) prompted by a call I got a couple of weeks ago from the speaker in Montana,” Bedke told members of Idaho’s Citizens’ Committee on Legislative Compensation.
 Montana House Speaker Greg Hertz told him the Montana Legislature was considering going into session and then recessing for an extended period — possibly a couple of months — as that state deals with its own rising COVID-19 infection rates.
 Hertz asked what Idaho was going to do.
 “That prompted me to do a little research,” Bedke said.
 The 2021 legislative session is scheduled to convene Jan. 11. While Bedke hopes it proceeds to its normal conclusion near the end of March, his research uncovered a potential problem if it is interrupted.
 “Our ability to take an extended recess without being paid per diem doesn’t exist,” he said. “If we’re in session ... it isn’t possible to not take per diem, in the event of an extended recess.”
 That’s because Article III, Section 23 of the Idaho Constitution says the Legislature “shall have no authority to establish the rate of its compensation and expenses by law.”
 Instead, legislative pay rates and reimbursement for expenditures are set by the Citizens’ Committee on Legislative Compensation every two years. Lawmakers can reject or reduce any changes the committee recommends, but they can’t increase their own pay. Nor can they pass a law saying that, under special circumstances, they won’t accept per diem while they’re technically still in session.
 Lawmakers who live more than 50 miles from Boise receive $139 per day while the Legislature is in session to help cover the cost of lodging.
 Bedke noted that some lawmakers simply rent hotel rooms while they’re in town. Others, however, lease apartments or condos for the whole session.
 “I don’t think we want to be in the business of doing (financial) harm to our colleagues, but by the same token we don’t want to take advantage of taxpayers by getting paid per diem when we aren’t there,” Bedke said.
 The committee addressed the issue by approving language saying if the House and Senate approve a resolution recessing the session for more than three days, then per diem would only be paid at the discretion of the House speaker or Senate president pro tem.
 That same process is already used to approve other expenses, such as the cost of traveling to and from Boise during the session. This would simply give the presiding officers the same flexibility regarding per diem payments, in the event the session is interrupted.
 “More flexibility would be welcomed,” Bedke said. “The Legislature needs the ability to stop per diem in the event of an extended recess. I hope it doesn’t come to that, but we’re all Boy Scouts. The Boy Scout motto is ‘Be Prepared,’ and this is an area where we aren’t prepared.”
 In other action, the committee approved a 1.5 percent pay increase for lawmakers next year, followed by an additional 1 percent increase in 2022. That will increase their base pay from the current $18,415 to $18,691 beginning Jan. 1, and $18,875 in 2022.
 That still leaves Idaho in the bottom third nationwide for legislative compensation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

SPOKANE — Gonzaga’s schedule is a work in progress, but the Zags’ rebounding ability seems to be in midseason form.
 The Zags on Monday learned ESPN had pulled the plug on their season-opening tournament in Orlando, Fla. Gonzaga has bounced back with plans to face Kansas on Nov. 25 in a four-team event in Fort Myers, Fla., according to a tweet from CBS Sports.
 GU is expected to face Auburn on Nov. 27 in the second game of the multiteam event. The fourth team hasn’t been announced.
 As almost every college basketball program has learned in the past month or so, schedules are subject to change during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kansas, for example, would become at least the fourth different season-opening foe for Gonzaga.
 The Zags initially were scheduled to entertain North Carolina Central on Nov. 10 before the NCAA pushed the start date back to Nov. 25. GU then was expected to open at the Orlando Invitational, likely against Belmont or Siena. That tourney was shelved and replaced by a four-team event with GU facing Auburn and then either Texas Tech or Houston. Monday’s announcement then erased.
 The addition of Kansas would give GU three matchups against probable preseason top-10 teams. Gonzaga is scheduled to meet Baylor on Dec. 5 in Indianapolis in potentially a No. 1-vs.-2 matchup.
 The Zags will tangle with Iowa on Dec. 19 in Sioux Falls, S.D.
 Iowa is No. 6 and Kansas No. 9 in ESPN’s preseason poll. Gonzaga is optimistic its contest with No. 11 Tennessee that was scheduled for Dec. 2 in Orlando will be played in a different location. Indianapolis reportedly is a potential site.
 Kansas lost its top two scorers in Devon Dotson, who declared for the NBA draft after his sophomore season, and center Udoka Azubuike, but returns a solid core led by 6-foot-5 senior guard Marcus Garrett, who was named the Naismith defensive player of the year last season.
 Kansas and Gonzaga were first and second, respectively, in the final Associated Press poll last season. The order was reversed in the final NET rankings with GU at No. 1. Both were expected to be No. 1 seeds before the NCAA tournament was canceled because of the pandemic.
 The Zags and Jayhawks are expected to begin a two-game series with the first game at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence in December 2022 and the return game at the McCarthey Athletic Center in December 2023.
 Gonzaga also is working on scheduling a handful of home games at the McCarthey Athletic Center. Tarleton State is set to visit Dec. 8. Dixie State, a Division I newcomer based in St. George, Utah, will visit GU on Dec. 29, according to a school release.
 Dixie State was 23-7 last year in its final year in NCAA Division II. The Thunderbirds have joined the Western Athletic Conference and will be in the first year of a four-year reclassification period to D-I.

"We hebben ervoor gevochten en gestreden. We komen op 0-2, dan moeten we het in de tweede helft slimmer uitspelen", zei Ten Hag dinsdag na afloop van het duel met Atalanta bij _Ajax TV_.

OREGON CITY, Ore. — A state commission has voted to recommend that the Confederate flag no longer be allowed in Oregon’s historic cemeteries.
 Members of Oregon’s Commission on Historic Cemeteries voted unanimously Friday to adopt a position paper recommending Confederate flags not be allowed in historic cemeteries at any time, KOIN-TV reported. That includes flying the flag on poles or small flags placed on individual graves.
 “We do not support allowing flags in historic cemeteries that promote systemic racism, fear, and oppression of anyone,” the position paper reads. “It is extremely important that historic cemeteries are maintained as places where the visitors feel safe and welcome.”
 Chairwoman Bev Power noted in Friday’s meeting the committee can’t punish cemeteries that don’t abide by the recommendation.
 More than 1,500 historic cemeteries are registered with the state of Oregon. In order to be considered historic, they must have at least one burial of a person who died before Feb. 14, 1909 — 50 years after Oregon became a state.
 The discussion began in July, at a time when many cities, counties and states were banning the Confederate flag at public sites in response to weeks of protests against police brutality and systemic racism after the May 25 police death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
