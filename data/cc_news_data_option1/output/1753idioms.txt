Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Actor Paul Walker's untimely death back in 2013 continues to send reverberations through his ample fan base even now. One important sector of that fanbase are those who admire Walker for his commitment to automobiles – like Steve McQueen and other car-buff movie stars before him. At this point his car collection is the stuff of almost as much discussion as his film performances. But what happened to Paul Walker's car collection after he died?
 It's a story that will inevitably remind the reader of a _Fast and Furious_ plot, involving as it does allegations of car theft against one Richard Taylor, who Walker had reportedly trusted to oversee his impressive automobile collection before his death. Paul's estate has claimed that Taylor removed more than 30 of the late actor's cars from their warehouse only hours after his death, including a 2011 Porsche 911 GT3 RS, a 2008 BMW M3, and many more, in a move that can be charitably described as audacious.
 Walker's estate used different words when they sued Taylor in 2015, alleging that after moving 31 of Paul Walker's cars to "locations unknown," he provided the estate with what he called a "Paul Walker Current Car Inventory List" comprised of 32 cars. The suit said that there were seven cars known to have been part of Walker's collection that were missing from the list, and that they were to be returned ASAP. The following year, the lawsuit between the Walker estate and Taylor was "settled amicably" according to one of the estate's attorneys, with some or all of the cars being returned to the estate – but the precise terms of the settlement were and remain confidential.
 Unfortunately that wasn't the only lawsuit filed by Paul Walker's family regarding his car collection. In 2014, Paul Walker III (Walker's father) filed suit against the estate of Roger Rodas, the late friend of Paul's who was driving the car when the crash that killed both of them occurred. Later, in 2016, a reported settlement was reached in this case as well, with $10.1 million being paid into a trust for Walker's then-17-year-old daughter Meadow.
 As for what ultimately happened to Paul Walker's car collection after the various legal battles, fans of the actor might have been dismayed to learn several months ago that much of the collection was going up for auction:

As constitutional experts scramble to work out what the ECB will have to do in order to satisfy the hardliners in the German court, markets have seen a hit to risk appetite, as once again the potentially-fatal weakness of the eurozone system comes into play. _                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Almost four million were immediately thrown out of work, schools were closed and hospitals were emptied in anticipation of a wave of COVID-19 victims that thankfully never came.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  No one knows yet how much harm Newsom’s severe and unconstitutional shutdown will do to the people of California in the long run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  But you can bet that the number of suicides and heart attacks from financial and emotional stress will spike.

Meanwhile, while much of the state has been put into a politically induced economic and social coma, Californians have behaved like good citizens — until last weekend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  That’s when tens of thousands of young people stormed several re-opened beaches in two Southern California counties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Gov. Newsom got really angry at this first sign of mass resistance to his arbitrary shutdown orders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  He shamed the beachgoers publicly for not practicing social distancing and putting all Californians at risk of catching and dying of COVID-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There was talk that he was going to close the state’s 280 beaches and parks this weekend to teach all Californians a lesson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  But on Thursday, he backed off because of the increasing push-back and ordered only the beaches in Orange County to close.

Even if late-May isn’t possible, canceling the season doesn’t seem to be on the table. White said the league could evaluate the schedule on the fly, re-evaluating COVID-19 conditions every two weeks.

Those sponsors are still holding strong, but any progress in that area was completely halted by the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Mankato is scheduled to host the Northwoods League all-star game in July, a great draw for sponsors, but that event will be less likely to happen as things get pushed back. However, it’s likely Mankato would get the game in 2021 if it’s canceled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          There’s also issues with player safety, and host families are at the top of that list. White said there’s not been much concern raised by the families in Mankato, but that’s not the case everywhere. It’s possible that various host families throughout the league may not be willing to host a player this summer.

Anyone can make a dumb prediction. Few have made ones of a more high-profile and quickly discredited nature. And for Hassett it's rather par for the course. His is a DC GOP think tank (sinecured) economist who has generally paid no professional or reputational price for being wrong about virtually everything for decades. The decision to put such a person in charge of creating a predictive epidemiological model in the midst of a national crisis based on no professional or academic expertise whatsoever defies all logic. But then, who are we kidding? The President put his son-in-law, who's only professional accomplishment was nearly bankrupting his real estate family after he took the reins after his father went to prison, in charge of epidemic crisis response.                   *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Play better. smarter. Sacrifice. His world was professional basketball, so it sounded like a basketball conscience. But it was also the voice of a loving husband and father. It was a voice that had to be behind the scenes to hear why Smith was an assistant coach, a lieutenant, for the most part unnoticed by the camera and the crowd. But he was a young voice, one with old-fashioned values, but new ideas on how to implement them. He was a prepared voice, strong and meaningless You would have liked to respect him on time because he was growing in stature and respect, except we will never have that pleasure because Derek Smith is dead.

Gavin Newsom a perfect excuse to unleash his inner dictator and greatly expand his power over the social and economic lives of his subjects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Like other authoritarian Blue State governors across the country, he quickly ordered the shutdown of all nonessential activity in the entire state and issued stay-at-home orders for 40 million Californians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"In [2018], Malik was coming off that injury and got better as the year went on," Reich said, via Stephen Holder of TheAthletic.com. "Last year, I really felt like Malik had a really good year. You could really feel his presence. Physically, I felt Malik's presence on the field. Malik is not the most outgoing, bubbly personality. He's got a lot of juice and intensity in him and I think you really saw that come out last year when he was healthy, when he started playing real physical and making plays on the ball. So, really excited and expecting big things from him this year."

There are so many ways to celebrate moms on Mother's Day which, if you haven't been keeping track of your calendar, is on May 10. You can send a card, you can make a phone call - don't you DARE text her - you can, if everyone is masked up to the max and keeping their distances, pay a visit. Or you can observe the day with moms other than your own. Some of the best - and worst - of them have been in movies.                                        So, in honor of moms everywhere, and of every sort, here's a top 10 list of movies that have featured mothers in pivotal parts.                  "Carrie" (1976) - Piper Laurie made it to the Oscars with a Supporting Actress nomination as Margaret White, the intimidating religious fanatic mom of Sissy Spacek's title character who was regularly the victim of her crazy mother's penchant for punishment, and her irrational fear of not inflicting it.                  "Flirting with Disaster" (1996) - There are many mothers in this comedy about Mel Coplin's (Ben Stiller) search for his birth mom. Accolades go to two of them: his take-no-prisoners adoptive mother, Pearl (Mary Tyler Moore), who won't let anyone get in the way of her own words, and his laidback hippie of a real mom, Mary Schlichting (Lily Tomlin), who knows the right way to talk people down from bad acid trips.                  "Forrest Gump" (1994) - Mrs. Gump (Sally Field) is Forrest's (Tom Hanks) loving mom, a sweet woman who has oddball thoughts spinning in her head (about vacations, about the Ku Klux Klan), and is credited with the idea of life being like a box of chocolates. She also makes sacrifices for her son, like sleeping with his public school principal so Forrest won't have to go to a "special" school.                  "Hairspray" (2007) - John Travolta was nominated for his acting in "Saturday Night Fever" and "Pulp Fiction," and probably should have been for his willingness to go so over the top - in both sight and sound - as Edna Turnblad, the lovable and ever-loving - and ironing and dancing - mom of Tracy (Nikki Blonsky).                  "The Incredibles" (2004) - When Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter) is fighting the bad guys, alongside her husband, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), she's as fierce as they come. When she's back home, playing mom to her three kids, and answering to the name Helen Parr, she's loving and protective ... and still pretty darn fierce about trying to keep a semblance of normalcy.                  "Lady Bird" (2017) - Laurie Metcalf's Marion McPherson is all over the place in moods and attitudes, and she's quick to dole out advice to her daughter, Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan), such as explaining that being successful doesn't mean that you're happy. The two characters do a bit of verbal sparring, but there's nobody that Marion cares more about than Lady Bird.                  "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) - Patty Duke won the Supporting Actress Oscar for "The Miracle Worker," but it should have gone to Angela Lansbury, for her performance as Eleanor Shaw Iselin, the conniving and downright evil mother of Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), who values political power over the life of her son.                  "Mommie Dearest" (1981) - There's evil and then there's its anagram, vile. Faye Dunaway got to sharpen the acting tools that would bring out the despicable side of Joan Crawford who was, to put it mildly, totally in charge of the abusive, passive-aggressive relationship with her adopted daughter Christina (Diana Scarwid). Definitely a disturbed, out-of-control mom.                  "Mother" (1996) - Debbie Reynolds made it appear that her character, Beatrice Henderson, the doting mother of John (Albert Brooks) was a bit clueless. Oh, please! Sure, she wasn't technically savvy, and she didn't really know her way around fresh food, but she's a great mom who only wants the best for both of her sons. She's sweet and funny.                  "Room" (2015) - Brie Larson is known only as Ma in this emotional storm of a movie in which she's kidnapped, made pregnant, and made captive in a 10x10 windowless room, in which, over the years, she raises her son (Jacob Tremblay). Larson manages to imbue the challenging performance and desperate situation with a great deal of light. And love saves the day.                  All films are available through Amazon Prime Video.                  Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

NEW BEDFORD -- Onne van der Wal, one of the most prolific and talented marine photographers in the world of sailing, will take viewers on an adventure across America during a virtual Sailors' Series talk on May 12, at 7 p.m., presented by the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Van der Wal's presentation featuring his award-winning photography will be based on his recently released book, "Sailing America." Viewers can join the online presentation by visiting the Sailors' Series webpage at www.whalingmuseum.org and clicking on the "Registration" link. There is no charge to participate.          The Whaling Museum has been shifting its focus to digital content during the Covid-19 emergency in order to give people a way to "Museum from Home." The new online offerings include virtual tours; behind-the-scenes talks with staff experts; lectures; distance learning art, science, and history resources for educators, students, and parents; trivia activities; and more.          For the better part of four decades, Onne van der Wal has been capturing iconic images of the sport of sailing. His career was launched on board Flyer, the winner of the 1981-'82 Whitbread Race. He crossed the starting line as a professional sailor, but he finished the race as a photographer, and he's never looked back.          The Whaling Museum's 2020 Sailors' Series is dedicated to Llewellyn Howland III, and is supported in part by The Samuel D. Rusitzky Lecture Fund. This year's series is presented in partnership with the Cruising Club of America, New Bedford Yacht Club, Beverly Yacht Club, and Tabor Academy. Additional information about Sailors' Series events is available at www.whalingmuseum.org.

The state has set a goal of reducing phosphorus in the river by 45% and cutting nitrogen by 20% percent in the next five years and reaching a 45% reduction in nitrogen by 2045. That would reduce the algae growth that degrades the river.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The excess nitrogen and phosphorus comes partly from urban runoff, which means residents and cities will need to continue efforts to cut lawn fertilizer use and create more storage ponds to hold water while nutrients filter out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          But the real challenge is the millions of acres of farmland that have been tiled extensively in recent decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Tackling that problem requires more cover crops to hold topsoil on the landscape and tiling systems that slow the rush of water to the rivers. If more water is held on the landscape, it not only keeps more nutrients out of the river but also will reduce the high water flow that erodes stream banks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The problems and solutions for the Minnesota River have long been known. What is needed is a more aggressive approach to get more cover crops and water storage on the landscape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Smith's moment in the garden was fleeting. The Celtics lost in the next round to the Pistons, and Smith did not play in Game 6. He was expected to return next season ("He hasn't seen the real Derek Smith yet," he said of coach Chris Ford). But the knee didn't cooperate, and on November 7, 1991, the Celtics ended the suspense when they signed veteran guard Rickey Green to fill his spot on the list.
