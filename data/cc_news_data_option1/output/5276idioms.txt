While I think Alexandria marked the end of the beginning, it was Glenn’s death that marked the beginning of the end for this show. By that I mean, things started to go downhill in Season 6 (think of all the weird turns and dirty tricks played in that season) but they really went to pot when Negan showed up and smashed in Glenn’s head. After that we got Seasons 7 and 8, two of the worst seasons of TV I’ve ever watched (though maybe not quite as bad as the recent seasons of _Fear The Walking Dead_ ).

At Providence Point Healthcare there's an incentive program to get staff to take the vaccine. If 100% of staff get the vaccine, they could get up to $100 each. The incentive will also provide $50 for 50% of staff and $75 for 75%.
 "We're here to protect the residents," Myers said. "If that's the one thing I can do to be sure that the people in my building stay well and stay safe. Then that's just one more thing that I can go home at night and feel confident that I've done a good job."
 At Rivercrest Place, Executive Director Clinton Warf said most residents are on board with the vaccination.
 "Most of them are like 'yes we're going to get it,'" Warf said. "Some of them have the attitude if it's my time it's my time. But I'd rather be able to see my family and have a little bit of normalcy. Versus what it's been like which is so restrictive."
 Warf said there's mixed feelings among staff. They don't have a vaccination date set because more high risk facilities have access first. Both facilities are looking forward to protecting their residents and staff in this process.
 Parkview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center said its vaccination date is January 19 tentatively.

Now imagine that, but with literal super soldiers. They are more than psychologically damaged by war. They go to war and it drives almost all of them violently mad. That's where the story truly begins. Two ex-soldiers leave the service after participating in a government-sponsored genocide. One of them is about as sharp as a butter knife, but escaped the butchery with his sanity intact. His much more clever friend, however, wasn't so lucky. He's completely and violently out of his mind.      Taking care of a violently insane battle buddy is easier said and done, so they drift around the world in abject poverty… then that Cold War finally goes hot and none of that matters anymore. Suddenly, a young man who was so tortured he was a hair away from eating his gun is suddenly like a child in Candyland. There's a whole new world just for people like him. No rules, no restraint, no nothing. He can do anything he wants. For the criminally insane, a world gone mad is the promised land.      So yes, _Ultra Violence_ is about the villains. That felt like an odd way to kick of a book series and not the one I expected, but that's how it happened. Like most of my writing projects, my original first chapter of _Tales From Venus_ was growing too massive. I endlessly fleshed out my growing cast of characters with back stories that just refused to stop growing. It became too much. I had to cut out some content. But it was too good. I couldn't just take all that nice copy and toss it in the waste bin to never see the light of day.      Then it hit me. There were two villains in particular, these two ex-soldiers. They weren't even the main villains of the book, just a sort of mini-boss and his right-hand man for the heroes to defeat. But that dynamic duo was increasingly fascinating to me, and I eventually had to accept that their back story was too much to cram as a flashback into someone elses's adventure. My two sadistic monsters needed a book of their own. That book became _Ultra Violence_ , and was much more engrossing for me to write than I could ever have guessed.

Now that we’re past the dark days of Season 7 and Season 8, the show has picked back up, though the Whisperer conflict was quite the slog after a while.

Hummm. Arlon Davis has struck again with another unhinged, around the bend, long missive about how the Democratic Party stole the 2020 election from his hero, Donald Trump. The letter is chock full of every conspiracy theory that has surfaced, none of which have come remotely close to being proven, and all of which have been unceremoniously tossed out of state courts, and twice and by the Supreme Court of the United States. I've been closely associated with the federal and state judicial systems for over 50 years, and I know a thing or two about how they work. When you get kicked out of a courtroom immediately after filing a suit, it means that you don't have a case and that your allegations are unsupported by law or facts, or in this case both. As I said in an earlier letter in response to Mr. Davis's rants, "everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but they're not entitled to their own facts". Mr. Davis likes to bloviate, but all of his assertions are without fact or law to back them up, which is why Rudy Giuliani and his helpers have lost at every tum. I don't really think many people, even a lot of Trump voters, really believe much of anything that is contained in Mr. Davis's letter, but it is still necessary to debunk the wild assertions he has made. This can be done easily, so here it goes: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WON THE ELECTION, which by almost all expert accounts, was the cleanest in the history of all presidential elections.

A positive workplace isn't one filled with misguided optimism or by a persistent "can-do" attitude. Too much of either not only is irritating but can also lead to a culture of toxic positivity that encourages employees to feign a good mood or "look on the bright side" instead of dealing with negative emotions. This can harm employees far more than it helps them: By constantly suppressing their true feelings, employees put their mental health at risk.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — A direct mortgage lender will expand its Charlotte operations by adding 500 jobs over the next five years and investing about $5.8 million into its operations hub. Intercontinental Capital Group, a privately held company headquartered in New York, plans to begin hiring for the jobs next year, according to a Tuesday news release from North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper’s office. It currently has 179 employees at its Charlotte office. The company could receive nearly $7.7 million in incentives from the state over a 12-year period if it meets certain requirements for job creation and investment. Charlotte won the expansion after competing with Indianapolis, Indiana and Richmond, Virginia for the company’s investment, according to state documents obtained by The Charlotte Observer. Dustin DiMisa, the founder and CEO of the company, told the newspaper he felt the mortgage lender would better attract and retain talent in North Carolina. The lender specializes in single-family residential properties. They were previously censured and fined by different states for practices regulators said were misleading, the newspaper reported. DiMisa said the company is now “extremely compliant” with marketing regulations. The mortgage lender, DiMisa and another former executive were also sued by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015. A news release from the agency said it was for their role in a fraud scheme that was perpetrated by a charity and included other mortgage lenders. They settled for about $400,000.

Government-sponsored studies like the ones conducted by Marshall, thoroughly dissected the effectiveness, combat participation, and even the ratio of a soldier's shots fired to how many enemies he actually aims in and hits with them. The conclusions from World War II and Korea were disappointing to say the least. Today is a different story. American soldiers are better killers than ever before. Our fathers' fighting units were lucky when 10% of their men engaged the enemy or even fired a shot at all. Today that number has shot up to 90%. We excel at killing but this comes at a cost. In Vietnam and wars following it, PTSD rates exploded to record highs, proportionally going up as the psychological conditioning of our soldiers improved. With this in mind, Ultra Violence tackles an obvious and disturbing question: what happens when, sooner or later, the science of brainwashing soldiers achieves perfection? Will those soldiers go home with their sanity impacted by PTSD, or will they be sane at all?

An implied theme of the opening war chapters of Ultra Violence is the ironic nature of a conscript's life. A uniformed man with a gun isn't technically a dictator, but he does have absolute power over people without guns. But sooner or later, probably sooner than later, the conscripted soldier will himself be a person without a gun, or any other power at all. "Thank you for your service" is a nice platitude, but governments have no problem ignoring this lip service. Skeptical? Remember the ill-fated March of the Bonus Army by desperate WWI veterans and their families in the Great Depression. Congress broke their promise of a pension to its former soldiers, then sent currently serving soldiers with bayonets fixed to disperse the veterans by any means necessary. Did those charging soldiers see the irony in what they were doing, or how morally repugnant it was? Maybe, but they followed the order nonetheless. Can you guess who led this assault? None other than two of America's most famous generals in the 20th Century: Douglas Macarthur and George Patton. Macarthur was borderline delusional with fantasies that he was putting down nefarious communist infiltrators. As for Patton, he was his usual dickish self. One protester who fought side-by-side with Patton in the war asked to see him. He thought that their service under fire would mean something, even now when they were on opposing sides of a confrontation. Maybe Patton would see his old war buddy and be amicable to a peaceful solution, or at the very deescalate to less ruthless tactics. The guy was wrong. Their shared past of serving together in combat meant nothing to the cold-hearted field officer. Patton wouldn't even look at his former comrade. And so this disgraceful atrocity continued as planned.

IM: For me, the key to dialogue is speech pattern. That's not only important, but easy to misunderstand. I've seen more than one author to try to mimic an accent. That's pointless in a text-based story. The reader already knows the speaker is from the deep South, British, or an Arab who learned English as a second language. Identify the person properly and your reader will imagine the accent without help. Changing up spelling and grammar to imitate an accent and slang usually just succeeds in making the text difficult to read, and will also just come off as silly. There's yet the other danger of offensive stereotyping. I believe stereotypes, or archetypes, are excellent templates for characterization when used properly, but when it comes to portraying people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, attempts to imitate their way of speaking puts the author on thin ice.. Every artistic decision comes at the risk of falling flat with some people and you lose them as readers. That's just an inherent risk of art. But trying to force accents into your dialogue runs high risks and gains you nothing in return. If readers perceive you as being mocking or condescending, they won't like your story. Maybe only one out of a hundred of your readers will be offended. But that's still one less reader, and you lost him for no reason. The remaining 99 readers wouldn't have cared regardless, so you don't even win favor with them. You gain nothing.

This is stupid and the reasons people do it are equally stupid. But I'm going to be fair. I acknowledge that real-life people do sometimes mix together different languages, even amongst themselves. There are varying reasons for that - in some regions, different language groups live together so closely it just becomes the norm to mix up both. When it comes to flipping to English, I've seen that too.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A federal judge in Little Rock has temporarily blocked four new abortion restrictions hours after they took effect in Arkansas, including one that bans a procedure commonly used in the second trimester. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker late Tuesday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the four laws, which took effect earlier in the day. The order is set to expire on Jan. 5, unless it is extended. Baker had issued a similar ruling in 2017 blocking the four laws, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated that order in August, saying the case needed to be reconsidered in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision involving a Louisiana case. “Arkansas has repeatedly prevailed when it has appealed similar rulings by Judge Baker and will ultimately do so again,” Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in a statement. The laws, passed by Arkansas' Legislature in 2017, include a ban on the second trimester procedure known as dilation and extraction. Several states have passed similar bans, and a federal appeals court in New Orleans has agreed to reconsider its ruling that struck down Texas' ban. The Arkansas challenge was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of a Little Rock abortion provider. An attorney for the ACLU said during Tuesday's court hearing that eight women scheduled for abortions next week in Little Rock would not be able to get them if the laws remained in effect, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. “Access to abortion in Arkansas has been preserved — for now,” said Ruth Harlow, senior staff attorney in the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project. “We are gratified that the court recognized the irretrievable harm these laws would cause...
