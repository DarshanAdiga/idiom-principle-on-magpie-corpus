The National Weather Service (NWS) received more than 700 reports of severe weather Saturday and Sunday, combined. Eight of those reports were tornadoes, and a large number of the storms hit states in the Mountain Prairie and Midwest freight regions. Many of the same states will be under the gun again for the next few days.

If we can take a break from thinking and writing about masks and distancing to think long term about other issues — and I think we must — let’s consider about how the Aspen housing market is being transformed in a way that will soon make today’s housing crunch look like the good old days.
 Not too many years ago, the Aspen-area housing crunch had more or less stabilized. New unit approvals were in rough balance with the loss of local free-market units to second-home uses. Relatively small projects underway at Park Circle, 802 W. Main St. and 488 Castle Creek Road will add about 45 units to the inventory. In the meantime, it was well established that the remaining single-family units in local hands was continuing to go from local residential use to second-home use, offsetting the addition of affordable units.
 All this was before the pandemic brought waves of refugees to Aspen seeking escape and safety. With them comes new upward pressure on housing prices. Realtors say just about all the current inventory is spoken for, under contract and ready to change hands to serve our new refugees.
 It’s a bit early to quantify the change — we won’t have definitive data for a while — but the census and birth records will quite possibly show a reversal of declining population in the free-market neighborhoods that have been in decline for three decades. Aspen Valley Hospital saw 44 births between March 15 and May 7, a rate that would yield about 300 births per year, almost double Pitkin County’s average annual birth rate of 160 over the last two decades.
 Whether this is a fluke or the product of a refugee wave coming here for safety and comfort from the big cities remains to be seen. In the meantime, Aspen is packed, and traffic is at levels typical of non-COVID-19 years even without the music festival, Food & Wine and other events designed to induce visitation.
 The upshot is that what remains of the locally occupied free-market housing is being converted into second-home, vacation-rental and refugee uses. The latest affordable housing lottery drew 160 entries for nine rental units, a significant number considering the uncertain state of the economy for those at the low end of the income ladder. Of the applicants, 122 qualified with incomes of $65,750 per year ($75,150 for couples).
 Every Aspen City Council candidate for the past two decades has pledged to maximize housing, but, when push comes to shove, the whiners are usually able to trim off a big chunk of proposed projects in the interest of “view planes” and “community character.” Most recently, a handful of objectors complained that their view (as they speed down Castle Creek Road) would be ruined by tall buildings, and the council coughed up four units to satisfy the objection.
 From the newspaper coverage of the latest work session on July 6, it seems like the council will back away from maximizing the lumberyard property with a more modest development scheme. Council people were quoted as being “beyond their comfort zone,” concerned with the views of the brush-covered hillside known as Deer Hill and an “alien spaceship” appearance.
 Unfortunately, tapes of that meeting have not been posted, so I cannot independently assess the tone and tenor of the meeting but, with the exception of Skippy Mesirow, it looks like we are headed for another compromise on the last big opportunity for housing in a town where the transformation to a commuter culture is accelerating, and the next step down the valley for lottery losers is 40 miles down the road.
 At some point, it’s not about elected officials being “comfortable” with hard decisions, it should be about what is right for the community in the long run. The whole point of the Aspen Area Community Plan and other community planning has always been about preserving the character and the characters, not the view planes from a four-lane highway where eyes should be on the road. Had we listened to the naysayers years ago, there would be no Burlingame housing, no Hunter Creek, no Centennial and only a smattering of local working-class families sprinkled among the second-, third- and fourth-home palaces.
 We would, in a word, be Vail.

Not only is this cold front going to bring some more pleasant temperatures to the area, but portions of Siouxland will also see some more much-needed precipitation. As the front passes, Siouxland will see scattered showers and thunderstorms not only tonight but also on and off throughout tomorrow. Rainfall totals will range from around a tenth of an inch to a half an inch.

Those are real comments and, I think, important to recognize, even if they don’t to attach their names to them. Because they are genuine concerns after a week of practice. And, to be fair, there are mixed feelings. The coaches I have talked to are over-the-moon happy to be back with their kids and practicing again.
 And some also believe this can work somehow, even if it might not look at all like a “normal” season.
 “I think the sentiment has been pretty consistent from coaches I’ve heard from,” said Ben Davis coach Jason Simmons, who is also the assistant director for the Indiana Football Coaches Association. “It is great to be back with the kids, our coaches, and be back at it. But as far as what we are dealing with — the unknowns are hard to predict.”
 The second phase of the athletics reopening process is set to begin July 20. It does not differ drastically from the first, though physical contact will be allowed, along with helmets and shoulder pads at football practices. Locker rooms can be used up to 50% capacity. Neidig said the IHSAA would reassess the phasing transition by the middle of this week.
 But unless the decision comes from above the IHSAA, do not expect the fall season to be pushed back at this point.
 The first official practices for fall sports are set for Aug. 3 with girls golf on July 31. The first contests for girls golf is set for Aug. 3 with cross-country, volleyball and soccer on Aug. 15 and football on Aug. 21.
 “At this point, I don’t see us doing anything across the board,” Neidig said. “The thing I’m studying and looking at is that I think we could have pockets or an area that gets shut down because they have COVID. But there are counties in Indiana that have very low numbers of COVID. To shut down a school with no issues, I don’t think is the right thing to do. I think in football, for instance, there may be some teams that get shut down. But our intention is to simply play through and they would have a ‘no contest’ if they couldn’t play.”
 There are football coaches who would like to see football moved to spring, possibly swapped with a low-contact sport like baseball. But that does not appear to be probable in Indiana.
 "Could you do it? Sure,” Neidig said. “But there are considerations along the way. If you simply move it to spring, you put it on top of track and field and baseball. You have multi-sport athlete kids who would have to choose sports. And there has been some discussion nationally about the safety of players playing a spring season and then getting back out for a fall season.”
 For now, the course to a school year and a high school sports season remains on track. If you took around this weekend, at places like Grand Park in Westfield, travel sports in basketball, baseball and lacrosse are in full swing. School-based sports are different, obviously. There are more moving pieces — like getting school started. But a week into the process, Neidig feels like the return to high school sports is still in place.
 “I think we would be sticking our head in the sand if we didn’t believe there would be some positive cases,” he said. “The worst thing that can happen here is that you ignore symptoms and don’t screen kids on a daily basis. Then all of a sudden you have somebody comes through as a spreader and then you do have a big problem. I really believe we’re right where I expected us to be.”

Convenience retailing and 7–Eleven were born in Dallas, Texas, in 1927 when "Uncle Johnny" Jefferson Green, an employee of The Southland Ice Company (now 7–Eleven Inc.), had the bright idea to start selling bread, milk and eggs from an ice dock after local grocery stores were closed. In 1946, with stores open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., the name was changed to 7-Eleven. Stores started staying open around the clock in 1971.
