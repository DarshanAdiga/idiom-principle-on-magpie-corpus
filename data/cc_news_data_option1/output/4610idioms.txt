It is world-changing in one bad way. As such products proliferate, they make it more tolerable to get into a traffic jam. Right now, many people work hard to avoid driving at rush hour or during heavy traffic, and it’s important that they do. With a full traffic jam pilot, the time in jams is no longer wasted — you can get things done, even work at the office (back when we start working in offices again.) That means there is no big reason to avoid them, which could make them much worse. With gasoline cars, traffic jams also pollute a great deal.

Hospital capacity and staffing shortages remain acute concerns, Gov. Laura Kelly and Department of Health and Environment Secretary Lee Norman said Tuesday, although statewide mitigation tactics aren't yet in the cards.
   
 As facilities from Topeka to Wichita are seeing a shortage of available workers, Norman said the "competition for beds is getting stiffer."
   
 And staff shortages remain a problem as doctors, nurses or technicians contract the virus or await test results. Some hospitals in Kansas had adopted a bonus structure to encourage staff to take on more shifts, Norman said.
   
 Between Friday and Monday, the state saw 5,920 new cases of COVID-19, as well as 15 deaths reported in that time period. As of Tuesday, the state's seven- day test positivity rate was 41.3%, according to Johns Hopkins University.
   
 On Monday, Stormont Vail Health in Shawnee County reported an all-time high for infections in its facilities. Sedgwick County health officials told The Wichita Eagle on Monday that intensive care bed shortages were "critical" at the city's main hospitals.
   
 Even still, Norman said there was no interest yet in establishing a field hospital or other temporary hospital space, which leaders in Wisconsin were forced to construct after a dramatic rise in cases.
   
 In Kansas, the cold weather would likely make this prohibitive, Norman said, and he noted hospitals wanted to stay within their current footprint if at all possible.
   
 "You could build all sorts of construction and not necessarily solve the staffing problem," Norman said. "At this point in time, beds are tight, but it is really staffing that we are most concerned about."
   
 While "all options remain on the table" for halting the virus's spread, Kelly said the priority would be continuing to work with Republican legislators on a compromise strategy that included increased partnerships with local governments to encourage mask-wearing, as well as a public service campaign.
   
 She pointed to two counties, Lyon and Jefferson, that have imposed orders requiring face coverings in recent days. Other counties, however, such as Finney County have declined to implement a mandate, even as cases continue to rise.
   
 Executives in other states, both Democrat and Republican, have taken smaller steps to crack down on virus spread. In Minnesota, officials announced bar capacity would be reduced statewide while Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds narrowed the size of allowable gatherings.
   
 But Kelly said she would opt to leave those types of decisions to county officials for the time being, saying it would be more productive in the long run.
   
 That could change, however, if "the data drives us to do things differently," although she declined to say exactly where that point is.
   
 "If we cannot come up with a consensus that will work we will revisit that," Kelly said.
   
 Kelly did put stock in the state's unified testing strategy, which officials have long hoped will help better identify outbreaks and improve Kansas' testing capacity. It is targeted to especially increase the number of tests in the state's two largest urban areas in Wichita and Kansas City, Kan.
   
 But lawmakers have grumbled that the plan has taken too long to roll out, as the state has been forced to bid out those contracts.
   
 Kelly said the wait will soon be over, with the final contract signed in the last 24 hours. But even still, she cautioned that it wouldn't be a cure-all strategy.
   
 "It won't work if people do not abide by the other safety protocols," she said.
   
 Kelly congratulates Biden
   
 Kelly also praised President-elect Joe Biden on his victory in the presidential race, even as President Donald Trump refuses to concede victory.
   
 She noted that her administration had already begun conversations with Biden's transition team on COVID-19, with the president-elect naming a panel of pandemic leaders on Monday.
   
 And while Trump won Kansas by over 15 points, Kelly urged residents to keep an open mind about what a Biden adminsitration might look like.
   
 "I'm going to take him at his word," she said. "And I hope the people of our state will give him the same opportunity to follow through on his agenda."

The Great War consumed around 15 to 22 million lives and was, at the time, also called The War to End All Wars due to the scale of industrialized bloodshed and destruction. Decades later, it was followed by an even greater conflict. Countless families were torn apart and after the fighting stopped, it was up to those left behind to pick up the pieces. Even after so many years, the scars remain. Collins' novel portrays this pain, how the violence changed lives and families, affecting even those born after the shooting has ended. She shows the dread of not knowing what happened to lost loved ones. As well as the process and lengths some undertake in order to find out or bring some semblance of closure or reconciliation.

Each Nov. 11, U.S. citizens tip our hats and honor our former armed services members for their devotion to this nation.
 We do so by flying the American flag, offering veterans specials at restaurants, conducting ceremonies and posting thanks on social media — all appropriate gestures given the protections veterans offered to all of us.
 But are we honoring our veterans with our personal behavior?
 Veterans in part fought to protect the rights to free speech and assembly, as well as the right to choose our leaders without fear of reprisal. To be worthy of that service, we must treat those rights as gifts never to be sullied, disrespected or abused.
 We are failing miserably in that regard.
 Americans increasingly are corrupting those freedoms with reprehensible behavior. We tear each other apart on social media over simple disagreements about policy. We take to the streets armed with deadly weapons. We kill. We riot, loot and burn. We plot to kidnap governors and take over entire blocks of cities. We shove politics in each other’s faces with gargantuan yard signs and ugly rhetoric. We stop communicating with family, neighbors and friends.
 Leading up to last week’s national elections, the embarrassing dysfunction around our divisions had reached a fever pitch. In the wake of the voting, things have not changed.
 Neither side of the political divide is taking a higher path.
 Patriotic Americans do not threaten each other with violence on social media. They do not vandalize or steal others’ property. They do not seek to stifle processes. They do not make unsubstantiated claims. By the same token, they do not dismiss legitimate concerns.
 They do not gloat. They do not pout. They do not intimidate. They do not ordain themselves as the personal arbiters of truth. They do not bury themselves in a cocoon of like-mindedness.
 No, patriotic Americans work together for solutions. They work through legal processes to settle disputes. They listen to differences of opinion and challenge them with respectful dialog.
 That’s the citizenship for which our veterans fought.
 On Veterans Day, Americans should hit the pause button. When we thank our veterans for their service, we must do so with pride in the ideals behind their sacrifices. Today is an opportunity for Americans to remember what this evolving experiment in self-governance is all about.
 Honor our veterans by living up to our responsibilities as civil people. Honor ourselves by living that mantra every day.

 “We are really excited to welcome Chris, Chucky and Matthew into the Badger Family,” UW coach Greg Gard said in a statement. “All three of these young men identified that Wisconsin was where they wanted to be early in the process and never wavered. In fact, they formed a bond with each other as Badgers long before making it official.

ASHEVILLE, N.C. — Mike Morrell is about to begin his third season as UNC- Asheville’s head basketball coach, and he’s got his program headed on the right path.
 “As coaches I don’t know that you ever feel like you’re exactly where you need to be, but I feel like we’re definitely trending in the right direction,” said Morrell, a native of Elizabethton who played at Milligan University. “I came in with a plan and we stuck to that plan knowing that it wasn’t going to happen overnight.”
 UNC-Asheville was chosen second in Tuesday’s Big South Conference’s preseason poll — behind Winthrop — after posting the third-biggest turnaround in the country last season, going from four wins to 15.
 Morrell and his Bulldogs will take on East Tennessee State on Dec. 8 at Harrah’s Cherokee Center in Asheville, the venue where ETSU won the Southern Conference tournament in March. It’s a game Bucs fans have circled on the calendar mostly because it will be played in their favorite arena outside of Johnson City, even if they won’t be allowed to attend.
 For Morrell, it’s just another game on the schedule.
 “Obviously I’m from there but that’s kind of the extent of it,” he said. “I didn’t go to ETSU, so there’s no real connection. I don’t have any sentimental feelings. I’ve played ETSU before when I was at VCU.
 “I know a lot of people over at ETSU, know their staff really well. My mom lives about five minutes away from there and I know a lot of people who went there and played there, but when you’re coaching, you’re really just focused on trying to get your team ready to play.”
 The game came about when both teams were trying to fill out their schedules. They didn’t want it to be a home-and-home series because this year’s game might be played with no fans and next season’s might be in a full gym. Neither coach figured that was fair, so they opted for a one-time deal at a neutral site.
 “If we want to play down the line we’ll talk about it, but we don’t really have to worry about that until that time comes,” said Morrell, who spent time as an assistant at Clemson, VCU, Texas and Charleston Southern before getting his first crack at a head coaching job at Asheville. “I don’t think anybody’s fired up about playing in front of no fans and having to return a game with fans on either sides, so we made it a neutral game.”
 The Maui Invitational is being played at Harrah’s the week before and no fans will be allowed at the games, so there is little chance of spectators being allowed at the meeting between ETSU and UNC-Asheville.
 Morrell said his team will begin the season with no fans in the stands at its home games. The Bulldogs’ first three games are at home.
 “We’ll see what it looks like in January, but we’re going to have no spectators and kind of readjust,” he said. “I’m hoping we can at least get some families of players in here so they can see their kids play. I think right now the biggest goal is to just try to be able to play some games first and see how that goes.”
 The coronavirus pandemic has forced a change to the college basketball calendar. It’s also forced coaches to change just about everything they do.
 “At this point, with everything going on, it’s definitely a day-by-day thing,” Morrell said. “It’s definitely a different situation than what we’re accustomed to as coaches.
 “You have to adjust on the fly when adjusting on the fly is needed. For the most part you’re trying to keep these guys in somewhat of a normal situation when it’s not normal at all. It’s definitely a challenge. I’ll say this. I’m glad it’s not my first year as a coach because it’s a lot to deal with outside of trying to get your team ready to play.”

LA GRANDE — Eastern Oregon University basketball won't hit the court until at least the second week of 2021, according to a press release from the Cascade Collegiate Conference.
 While the Mounties' conference had hoped to start competition Dec. 4, fans will now have to wait another month before seeing players hit the hardwood.
 "With the surge in COVID-19 cases across our footprint and the work still pending with state/local health authorities on our Return to Play Plan, our CoP determined the best path forward was to delay the start of conference basketball until after the first of the year," said CCC Commissioner Robert Cashell.
 The CCC had announced a plan for safely returning to play just last week, but that plan was sidelined by a statewide flood of COVID-19 cases that have shattered records.
 Cashell said the CCC remains committed to giving players an opportunity to compete, and a revised schedule was said to be in the works.

Bolton is spot on, though, that the party’s strategy of “humoring” Trump while the court farce plays out will backfire badly. The president will try to get away with whatever he thinks he can get away with; that’s his nature, and it’s why handing him a second term in which he no longer had to worry about electoral consequences for his actions would have been so dangerous. The party believes, foolishly, that by lining up behind him on his “I was cheated” claims right now they’re giving him time to come to terms with the loss and putting courts in a position to let him down easy. But what they’re really doing, intentionally or not, is telling him that he has their support in resisting transferring power to Biden.

HOUSTON (AP) — The Trump administration is trying to deport several women who allege they were mistreated by a Georgia gynecologist at an immigration detention center, according to their lawyers.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already deported six former patients who complained about Dr. Mahendra Amin, who has been accused of operating on migrant women without their consent or performing procedures that were medically unnecessary and potentially endangered their ability to have children. At least seven others at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, who had made allegations against the doctor have received word that they could soon be removed from the country, the lawyers said.Hours after one detained woman spoke to federal investigators, she said ICE told her that it had lifted a hold on her deportation and she faced “imminent” removal.Another woman was taken to a rural Georgia airport early Monday and told to sign deportation papers, only to be brought back to the facility as her lawyers sued in federal court.They allege Amin performed operations that caused or worsened their pain without explaining what he was doing or giving them an alternative. Their stories fit a broader pattern of allegations made by detained women against Amin, some of them revealed in interviews with attorneys and&nbsp;medical records reviewed by The Associated Press. But there hasn’t been evidence to support an initial claim that he performed a large number of hysterectomies.The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general also is investigating.Amin’s lawyer, Scott Grubman, has previously denied the doctor did anything wrong and called him a “highly respected physician who has dedicated his adult life to treating a high-risk, underserved population in rural Georgia.” Amin has stopped seeing women at Irwin County Detention Center.Immigrant advocates have urged federal investigators to examine not just the doctor but also the detention center and any role ICE had in sending patients to him.While people who have been deported might still be able to serve as witnesses in a criminal or civil case, many end up in unstable countries or situations where it becomes difficult to maintain contact with them. The deportations are occurring in the last weeks of President Donald Trump’s administration following his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.“ICE is destroying the evidence needed for this investigation,” said Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia University law professor who is working with several of the women.ICE said it had notified the Homeland Security inspector general “about any planned transfers or removals of Irwin detainees who were former patients of Dr. Amin.”“Any implication that ICE is attempting to impede the investigation by conducting removals of those being interviewed is completely false,” the agency said in a statement.The Justice Department declined to comment. Grubman declined to say whether the doctor had spoken to investigators.Mbeti Ndonga, 37, was taken to Amin last year after seeking treatment for abdominal pain and excessive vaginal bleeding. She said she wanted a new prescription to continue treatment ordered by a previous doctor. Instead, she said, Amin insisted she have a procedure known as dilation and curettage, in which tissue is removed from the uterus as a treatment for excessive bleeding. Her medical records show she was also given a laparoscopy, in which incisions are made in the abdomen.“He was adamant and said I must have surgery,” Ndonga told AP.When she awoke, she said Amin told her she would never be able to have children. It’s unclear whether that’s the case. She still suffers from bleeding and pain.Ndonga has spoken twice to government investigators, most recently on Tuesday. “I told them that I was abused, tortured, dehumanized,” she said.Within hours of her first interview last week, Ndonga and her lawyers say she was told ICE had lifted a hold on her deportation and she could be sent to Kenya at any time.“Mbeti’s fear in answering the investigators' questions was that it would make her immigration case worse,” Mukherjee said. “And within hours of the interview, her worst fears were realized.”Another woman was taken to see Amin in February after requesting estrogen patches to treat hot flashes, following a hysterectomy performed by another doctor in 2014. She asked to be identified only by her first name, Yanira, because she fears being targeted by criminals if deported to Mexico.Yanira said Amin told her he would perform a vaginal ultrasound and that she would need a Pap smear, a test for cancer in which a doctor collects cells from a woman’s cervix.Both procedures caused her intense pain. After the Pap smear, Yanira said she noticed there was no lubrication on the tools Amin had used. She had trouble sitting for nearly a week.“We are humans. We are women. We have feelings,” she said. “Just because we are detained doesn’t mean we should be treated like animals.”ICE didn’t respond to questions about the two women, who were brought to the U.S. as young children. Ndonga was previously deported after being arrested for interference with government property, then apprehended by ICE after reentering the country, Mukherjee said.Yanira entered immigration custody after being arrested for possession of less than a gram of cocaine or methamphetamine, criminal records show. Her attorneys notified the government Thursday that she wanted to talk to investigators about Amin. Early Monday, Yanira says she was driven to an airport to board a deportation flight. But another ICE agent approached to say she wouldn’t be deported because her lawyers had intervened.Grubman declined to comment, citing federal privacy law.ICE policy instructs agents to “exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis” regarding the deportation of “victims of crime, witnesses to crime, and individuals pursuing legitimate civil rights complaints.”The agency said this week that it was “accommodating the interviews” done by government investigators. It added that once a detained migrant has exhausted all appeals, “they remain subject to a final order of removal ... and that order must be carried out.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Applying for a loan with a co-signer is low risk for the borrower, but high risk for the person co-signing. While the borrower is still the primary person tasked with paying off the loan, if they fall short or stop making payments, it becomes the co-signer's responsibility to complete the terms of the loan. This is a good option for you if there is someone in your life with whom you have an honest and trusting relationship with, i.e. a spouse or parent, who is willing to help.

Another way to approach the moment we’re in is this. Over the last few days, a strongman president who was just defeated at the polls has denied the legitimacy of his opponent’s victory; convinced the head of the Justice Department to change the rules so that federal prosecutors can start making noise about voter fraud; has fired the head of the military and begun installing underqualified cronies in some key defense positions; has apparently ordered arms of his administration not to cooperate with the winner of the election in transitioning power; and relished having his top diplomat half-joke, against all available evidence, that his boss had won reelection. If all of that were happening in, say, Turkey with Erdogan or in Venezuela with Maduro, what would you think was going on in that country? Would you think the strongman was responding in a routine and credible way to a threat to his power?

But through Naomi's fight is how I started to really see what might look more fair on the outside. … I have thought the industry, especially in Europe, I felt like you would see diversity on the runway, but it was a little exoticized. Having African models on … there could be something quite exploitative about that in a way.

The Titans, who finished second in 9-5A, picked up a 12-2 win over Prosper Rock Hill in the bi-district round and followed that up with a 11-0 sweep of Carrollton Creekview in the area finals.
 That set up a match against a familiar face in district rival Independence. The two teams went down to the wire, but it was Centennial who was able to pull out a 10-9 victory to advance.
 The Titans were not quite finished, as they picked up a 10-3 victory over Texarkana Texas High in the regional semifinals to mark their furthest playoff run ever, but the road came to an end at the hands of the Scots.

Most of the investment offerings in 401(k)s are mutual funds, each comprising a basket of stocks or bonds. Some 401(k) plans also give workers the option of investing in ETFs. Although more liquid than mutual funds (because they are traded throughout the day rather than just once at the end of the day), ETFs can also be more volatile. Many 401(k) investment offerings are index funds, which are designed to track the performance of one of the major market indices.

FLOWOOD, Miss. (WLBT) - You may have noticed tightness in your face, neck and jaw. Dentists say night stress is on the rise in 2020.It starts with grinding or gnashing your teeth at night – a condition called Bruxism. Many think it’s not any worse for their teeth than chewing, so they don’t seek dental help for it.Dr. Douglas Rummells of Integrity Dental Clinic said there’s a lot more going on when you’re grinding your teeth than you think.“And so these muscles are pretty strong and if I were to get you to register how hard you can bite, statistically you’re going to bite down four times harder when you’re asleep,” he said. “And so when you’re stressing out these muscles are doing their thing, these teeth are clinching together.”That can wear you out as fast as your teeth, says Dr. Charles Ramsey of the Mississippi Center for Orofacial Pain and Sleep Medicine. It can hinder even simple tasks like chewing and talking.“These power muscles are not getting rest, so people wake up with headaches and as the day goes on the muscles are in such a tone they can’t handle the stresses of the day,” said Ramsey.The American Dental Association did a study on the effects of 2020 stress on patients' teeth.“Over 50 percent are seeing an increase in the stress level of their patients. More fractured teeth, more broken teeth, so it’s becoming much more widespread,” Rummells said.One group definitely affected is nurses, Ramsey said. Another less likely group is teenage girls.“They need the social life, and you quarantine them at home and many don’t do well, they just don’t,” said Ramsey. “They need that social life and their depression gets worse, their anxiety gets worse.”Both Rummells and Ramsey said if you’re experiencing bruxism, please see a dentist.“It’s much better for you to get an inexpensive night guard to keep you from grinding than to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars down the road to fix your teeth,” said Rummells.Copyright 2020 WLBT.
