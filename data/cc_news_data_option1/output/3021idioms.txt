Sali a cassetta» ripete Nella. Poi diede le istruzioni a Paride su quale percorso fare e oscuro i finestrini con le tendine. La carrozza imbocco la strada piu a destra, via di Ripetta, la percorse tutta fino a uno slargo dove, abbandonato all'incuria, mangiato dalle erbacce ed eletto a regno di una colonia di gatti randagi, resisteva al tempo il mausoleo dell'imperatore Augusto. Costeggiando il porto di Ripetta, dove erano ormeggiate barche dalle vele latine di pescatori e di trasportatori, la carrozza si fermo, ostacolata da un grosso carico di cordame e tessuti che veniva scaricato a terra e sistemato su una serie di carri. Quando la strada fu sgomberata, proseguirono, sempre secondo le istruzioni di Nella, fino ad avvistare un ponte superato il quale, dall'altra parte, c'era Castel Sant'Angelo. «Siamo arrivati» annuncio allora Paride fermando i cavalli. Lo sportello della carrozza si apri e ne discese Nella, con un vestito logoro e di un indefinibile colore tra il grigio e il marrone. Paride e Pietro sbarrarono gli occhi, vedendola. Ma lei non disse niente e guardo alla sua sinistra una viuzza stretta, che proseguiva in diagonale, piegando in direzione contraria al ponte. Pietro lesse: VIA DI PANÌCO. Le case, dall'aria vetusta e malandata, erano ammassate le une alle altre. C'era un puzzo di umanita che non aveva di che lavarsi, cibi avariati e immondizia abbandonata in mezzo alla strada.

That's a bit complicated, I admit, and so a simplification of this idea is that adherents to Critical Social Justice see discourses--ways we think it is legitimate to talk about things--as the true fabric of reality and thus the core site of ethical consideration. This is their mythology, in a nutshell. As such, they will not be willing to participate in any process that reinforces, maintains, upholds, reproduces, or legitimizes the unjustly dominant discourses, as they see them. Supporting those is, in fact, just about the highest sin one can commit in the Woke faith. The discourses must instead be engineered into a state of perfection--God's Kingdom through Perfect Language --and it would not be permissible to engage in any behavior or process that allows oppression to be spoken _from_ or _into_ our discourses. Conversation and debate with people who speak from and in support of the dominant discourses would certainly therefore be considered highly problematic, and anyone who participates in it intentionally or even neglectfully would similarly be problematic.

En l’absence de Kylian Mbappé, Paris n’avait pas d’autre plan B que de mettre le ballon dans les pieds de Neymar et attendre que celui-ci marche sur l’eau. Le Brésilien est un joueur à part, et il a su se montrer intéressant par intermittence face à Lyon. Mais en Ligue des champions, contre des défenses organisées, ça ne suffira certainement pas. On a l’impression qu’à l’heure actuelle, le salut de Paris en Europe a plus de chances de venir d’une prouesse médicale que d’une réflexion tactique. Ander Herrera, à deux doigts de brûler un cierge pour accélérer la guérison de Mbappé : « On est optimiste pour Kylian, on a vu qu’il peut marcher, il est jeune et très professionnel. Il veut vraiment jouer, il travaille tous les jours, matin et soir. Bien sûr que sa présence est très importante, on espère qu’il va jouer. » Surtout après ce soir.

"A child enters your home and for the next twenty years makes so much noise you can hardly stand it. The child departs, leaving the house so silent you think you are going mad." John Andrew Holmes
 Growing up, my father took care of small, wild critters. That's probably where I got my love for wildlife. We had a bluejay named Charlie when I was about 2. I remember it very fondly, only by looking at pictures of myself and Charlie, but still. Keep in mind this was before you needed a permit to rehab wildlife in your home. This was also before car seats and cable. But not before dinosaurs.
 I have a bluejay now we named Charlie Jr. Unfortunately, he came in alone and good rehabilitators know you should always pair up animals if you can. We call each other to see if anyone has the same species, around the same age. They learn better from each other and have less of a chance of imprinting. This is when the animal sees humans as friends instead of their own species. They won't know how to integrate well into the wildlife population and may come too close to the wrong person. They also don't have to go into the world alone.
 I pride myself on keeping a good balance of nurture and nature. All things need love but they also need to know who they are. After constant cries and feedings, it's time for Charlie to start making his way outside. Small steps at a time. He doesn't have a parent out there to protect him which is hard. Just like with our real kids, heading into the world is scary. So Charlie sits on the branches, watches, and flies around. But when something scares him, he flies back to me, to safety.
 It makes me sad that I can't do more to help him in this new thrilling but scary world, just like my actual kids. All I can do is be there. I have seen this with birds before. I know he will eventually make friends, and learn to find food on his own. Pretty soon, he won't run to me as much because he will start to overcome those fears. Then his visits for food and comfort will become less and less. He will learn to navigate and thrive in the world he was a part of months ago, before I found him. This is a good thing. This is what we want for our children, but inside your heart breaks a little. You put so much time into them, for this moment and then they're gone. You're left with good memories but a hole in your heart that will always be there.
 In a couple of weeks, Charlie will be with his own kind. He won't fly to me anymore because he'll know humans may be scary. That's good. That's how it should be. But inside I hope just once in a while he remembers me and smiles.

BOISE — The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that an Idaho group must stop collecting online signatures for an education funding initiative for the November ballot.
 The court ruled in favor of Republican Gov. Brad Little’s request that a district court’s order allowing online signatures be stayed until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hears the case and makes a ruling. Arguments before that court are scheduled for the middle of August in the expedited case.
 “I am pleased that the Supreme Court upheld Idaho’s sovereignty over its election and initiative processes,” Little said in a statement. “It is important that initiatives follow the laws set by the Idaho Legislature so we can ensure those initiatives that get on the ballot are legitimate and have significant support throughout Idaho.”
 The Supreme Court’s ruling ends for now Reclaim Idaho’s attempt to collect enough signatures during the coronavirus pandemic for the initiative seeking to raise $170 million for K-12 education. It would raise Idaho’s corporate tax rate and increase taxes on individuals making $250,000 or more annually.
 But Luke Mayville of Reclaim Idaho, a group that backs initiatives and successfully got Medicaid expansion on the ballot several years ago that ultimately became law, said his group would continue collecting online signatures.
 The Supreme Court’s “decision only means that county clerks will not be required to verify signatures during the next two weeks,” he said.
 Mayville said the group was confident the appeals court would rule in its favor in mid-August, and signatures collected between now and then “could very well be valid.”
 Howver, Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a dissenting opinion wrote that “the stay granted today puts a halt to their signature-collection efforts.”
 The Idaho attorney general’s office declined to comment on whether signatures collected between now and an appeals court ruling in Reclaim Idaho’s favor would be valid.
 Idaho does not allow online signatures for ballot initiatives. The state has argued in court documents that it undermines the election process.
 Reclaim Idaho has about half of the 57,000 signatures it needs and an Aug. 26 deadline to collect the rest.
 The Republican governor filed an appeal to the Supreme Court earlier this month after the appeals court rejected his request to stay a district court’s order allowing online signatures until the case is decided on its merits.
 The Supreme Court cited case precedent that states retain leeway to protect the initiative process.
 “Nothing in the Constitution requires Idaho or any other State to provide for ballot initiatives,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. He also wrote that there’s “a fair prospect that the Court will set aside the District Court order.”
 Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh concurred in granting the stay.Reclaim Idaho in the lawsuit filed last month said Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March because of the pandemic didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature-gathering.
 The group in the lawsuit against Little and Secretary of State Lawerence Denney, also a Republican, said they violated the First Amendment-protected process of signature gathering, a form of political speech.
 U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill agreed with Reclaim Idaho and ordered the state to choose between accepting online signatures or simply putting the education funding initiative on the November ballot. When Idaho didn’t respond, Winmill ordered the state to collect online signatures or allow Reclaim Idaho to do so.
 Sotomayor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, saying the appeals court ruling was only weeks away and even with a favorable ruling Reclaim Idaho would have a difficult if not impossible task of collecting the remaining signatures by the deadline.
 Sotomayor wrote that the state could more easily omit the initiative from the ballot if the appeals court rules in Little’s favor, but signature gatherers Reclaim Idaho and initiative backers, “on the other hand, are in a far more precarious position.”

The expected fiscal effects of the coronavirus pandemic on Washington State University took center stage in a virtual COVID-19 town hall event hosted by the school Friday afternoon.
 When the university announced last week that fall classes would be delivered almost entirely online, WSU spokesman Phil Weiler said some were under the impression the move would save the school money. However, university leaders said shortly after the announcement that tuition would not be lowered, saying cost to the university and quality of instruction has not diminished.
 “Certainly it’s not less expensive and more specifically, as someone who has taught courses in both a remote environment and face-to-face, it’s actually much more challenging and many more hours,” WSU Provost and Executive Vice President Elizabeth Chilton said during Friday’s town hall. “Faculty are still providing live instruction, most of them at the appointed time, and they’re making themselves available to (students) … they’re still interacting with them one-on-one and in groups.”
 As any drop in tuition revenues would have significant budgetary implications, WSU Vice President for Finance and Administration Stacy Pearson said the school is watching enrollment numbers for the fall closely. She said while the pandemic does appear to have arrested a yearslong streak of enrollment growth, early metrics predict the number of students in the fall will be only slightly below those of previous years.
 Pearson said cuts to other important revenue streams have been more significant.
 Pearson said state officials told WSU to expect a drop in state appropriations of $37.2 million in May — about 10 percent of the school’s budget. She said those cuts were then handed down to deans and other department heads.
 “Each area’s leadership will determine how to absorb the final reduction as they prepare for budgets, not only for fiscal year ‘21,” Pearson said. “Our message from the state when we received our reduction was that they anticipated, based on the economic indicators, that we would probably be looking at these types of reductions for the next two fiscal years.”
 Person said budgetary practices that were put in place years ago have helped the university maintain its footing in the face of these cuts and revitalized departmental reserves that may now help cushion the blow.
 About three years ago, the university announced that it was spending more than it was bringing in and pulling money out of reserve funds to offset the shortfall. In light of this, the university system embarked on a three-year “fiscal health recovery plan” in an attempt to right the ship. That effort ended June 30 and because it went better than expected, the university has been able to inject about $30 million back into reserves.
 Pearson said those departments that underspent their budget will be allowed to use 5 percent of their remaining “carry-forward” balance to help reduce the amount they have to cut.
 The move is expected to allow the university as a whole to neutralize about $5 million of its $37.2 million reduction target.
 Weiler said WSU is also identifying central savings like those realized through reduced utilities usage, and looking to restructure current institutional debts for more favorable terms.
 Pearson said the school does not expect further reductions from the state at this time, but that could change if lawmakers call a special legislative session.
 “The good news is we did receive federal funding through the CARES Act as well as recently we also got some state emergency funding to help us get through fiscal year 2020,” Pearson said. “For fiscal year ‘21 though, it’s a little less certain just because we don’t know the status of some of those federal funds related to COVID, but we are keeping track of those expenses and monitoring them.”

PLYMOUTH - Slowly and surely, but also with an overabundance of caution, we're all starting to open up our world little by little as we come to grips with the Coronavirus pandemic. How things will go with the upcoming school year is still up in the air for the next couple of weeks, but a large group of athletes at Plymouth South are sitting on ready if they should get the green light to have a fall sports season.
 The student-athletes meet four times a week at the school as they re-connect with friends and start to stretch out muscles that might have gone into hibernation since on-site education ended in March. Using proper social distancing protocol, a group of Plymouth South coaches lead the athletes each session through exercises emphasizing strength, speed and flexibility.
 Here is video from a recent training session.
 Here is another link to a photo gallery from a recent training session.
 "I think the kids have been desperate to get out of their house and do something as a group as we try to get back into the normal swing of things," Panther Head Baseball Coach Walt Fust said. "We've got way more kids participating this year than we have in the past."
 Panther athletes have indeed turned out in record numbers for the training sessions so far this summer.
 "It's great to be able see everyone once again," senior Owen Muzrim said. The returning varsity football player said the team has a long road it front of it if they want to repeat last season's trip to the Gillette Stadium and the Division 4 Super Bowl, and "that road begins with the work we do together as a team in the off-season. These sessions are a great way to get in your workout and for everyone to start forming those team bonds" they'll need when things get real in the fall.
 Seniors Braley Quigg and Emma Pollock lost their spring sports season when lacrosse was canceled. Their fingers are crossed that their final soccer season won't suffer the same fate.
 "I was devastated when the lacrosse season was canceled. Last year was going to be the first time I played that sport at the high school level, so I was sad that it didn't happen," Quigg said. "The good part is that things are looking better and hopefully we'll be able to play all together again in the fall. It's been great seeing everyone at these training sessions and re- connecting with everyone.
 "I've been doing my workouts out home, but it's nothing like what we do together here. The summer training really helps you out as you get ready for the new season."
 Pollock agreed, adding that the loss of the spring season also hit her hard.
 "I was really looking forward to what we could do as a lacrosse team. I thought we had the chance to be pretty good so I'm just glad to be back on the turf once again," she said. "These summer sessions are great in the way I can re-connect with teammates I haven't had the chance to see in a while and the work we do now really helps us when practices start. The muscles are stretched out and we can hit the ground running when tryouts start."
 The summer training sessions are free of charge to Plymouth South students and will continue for the time being. The group meets from 8 to 10 a.m. on Monday's and Wednesday's and 4 to 6 p.m. each Tuesday and Thursday.
