The Turkish coast guard regularly publishes photos of these "rescues." However, all observers in the region state that Greece is not the only party reportedly violating the law. All too often, they say, the Turkish side will also spend a long time watching, preferring to film their Greek counterparts' alleged misconduct instead of acting promptly to save refugees in distress. "There's no good side here, because both sides are playing a game on the backs of vulnerable people," says Tommy Olsen, the founder of the platform AegeanBoatReport.

These issues were on everyone’s radar before COVID-19.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday made it easier for the president to fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The justices struck down restrictions on when the president can remove the bureau’s director. “The agency may ... continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our decision, must be removable by the President at will,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. The court’s five conservative justices agreed that restrictions Congress imposed on when the president can fire the agency's director violated the Constitution. But they disagreed on what to do as a result. Roberts and fellow conservative justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh said the restrictions could be stricken from the law. The court’s four liberals agreed, though they disagreed the restrictions were improper. The decision doesn’t have a big impact on the current head of the agency. Kathy Kraninger, who was nominated to her current post by the president in 2018, had said she believed the president could fire her at any time. Under the Dodd-Frank Act that created the agency in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB’s director is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term. The law had said the president could only remove a director for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” That structure could leave a new president with a director chosen by the previous president for some or all of the new president’s time in office. The Trump administration had argued that the restrictions improperly limit the power of the president. Defenders of the law’s removal provision had argued the restrictions insulated the agency’s head from presidential pressure. “Today’s decision wipes out a feature...

Barca have tried to sign Pjanic several times in recent seasons but negotiations intensified with Juve, who also needed to balance their accounts, in the last two months.
 The two clubs and Pjanic, who sources told ESPN is excited to be joining Barca, quickly came to an agreement, but Arthur remained adamant he wanted to stay put in Spain.
 He released a statement in April explaining he was going nowhere and then, as reported by ESPN, in May he told both Barca and Juve that he had no intention of being involved in any deal.
 However, with both clubs still pursuing the deal, and seeing how Barca were pushing for him to leave, Arthur finally performed a U-turn on his decision and gave the green light to the transfer.
 Arthur, who is seven years Pjanic's junior, was also won around in the end by Maurizio Sarri's desire to take him to Turin. The Juve coach envisages him as the centrepiece of his midfield moving forward.
 Meanwhile, Pjanic, 30, is set to sign a four-year deal with Barca, leaving Juve four years after he signed from Roma. Prior to that, he had plied his trade in France, playing for Lyon and Metz.

 BRANSON -- A jump in coronavirus cases after many businesses in the Branson area reopened to tourists has health officials concerned.
 The Taney County Health Department urged people to wear masks in public after reporting 11 new cases of COVID-19 Saturday, according to the Kansas City Star. The county's virus cases jumped to 54 from 15 over the past two weeks, and that total doesn't include visitors to the area who test positive but are counted in their home counties.
 The case numbers remain small compared to urban areas of the state, but Branson is a community of less than 12,000 residents in southwest Missouri.
 Health officials have worried that once the state opened back up they would see more cases.
 Many of Branson's businesses have reopened for tourism, including miniature golf courses, shops and restaurants. Many entertainers have returned to their stages around Branson as well.
 On Friday evening, dozens of people gathered for an outdoor concert at the Branson Landing. That outdoor mall along Lake Taneycomo will also host an Independence Day celebration this week complete with a beer garden, musical acts and fireworks.
 Last week, the Taney County Health Department's board passed a resolution asking residents and visitors to wear face masks or coverings in public places. But it is not a requirement.

NEW YORK (AP) — The shutdown on Broadway has been extended again — until at least early January. Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Jan. 3. “The Broadway experience can be deeply personal but it is also, crucially, communal,” said Thomas Schumacher, chairman of the board of The Broadway League, which represents producers. “The alchemy of 1,000 strangers bonding into a single audience fueling each performer on stage and behind the scenes will be possible again when Broadway theatres can safely host full houses,\" he added. “The safety of our cast, crew, orchestra and audience is our highest priority and we look forward to returning to our stages only when it’s safe to do so.” Broadway theaters abruptly closed on March 12, knocking out all shows — including 16 that were still scheduled to open — and postponing indefinitely the Tony Award schedule. Producers, citing health and city authorities, previously extended the shutdown to June 7 and then again to Sept. 6. In London, producer Cameron Mackintosh has said his company’s West End productions of “Hamilton,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Mary Poppins” and “Les Miserables” won’t reopen until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has canceled most previously announced performances and events through the end of 2020, as has the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston. Broadway grossed $1.8 billion last season and attracted a record 15 million people. Producers and labor unions are discussing ways theaters can reopen safely. The latest extension wipes away many shows planned for the fall. Many have just moved to next year,...

One of the bigger challenges of creating deepfake videos, as they’ve come to be known, is creating a vast database of facial images of a person — thousands of different expressions and poses — that can be swapped into a target video. The larger the database and the higher the quality of the images, the better the face swaps will turn out. But the images (which are more often than not headshots of famous people) are usually pulled from sources with limited resolution. Even a 4K video file can yield low-res face images given how small faces often appear in the overall framing of a shot.

NEW YORK (AP) — What started as a way for two musicians to get out of the house during the pandemic has turned into nightly concerts at the boathouse in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park -- with fans who expect them to play three to four hours a night, seven nights a week. The musicians, accustomed to playing their Haitian roots and jazz music in bars and restaurants that had been shuttered or limited to takeout by the lockdown, couldn’t be happier. “One day I came here with my guitar out of nowhere, to just get some fresh air. And people just started coming over. And then they were like, ‘Thank you!’ And then it took a life on its own,” said Alegba Jahyile, leader of Alegba and Friends. Jahyile, a Haitian raised in New York who plays guitar, drums and bass, recalled a woman who cried at one concert. “You made my day,” she told him. “It’s been a terrible week for me and my family. Listening to you, singing, I felt the joy, I found a little bit of serenity, of peace to my day.” It was then, Jahyile said, that “I decided that every day I would come here.” Classically trained saxophone player Mark Kraszewski has played with Jahyile for more a year. But Kraszewski, who was busking for tips in Central Park last September, can’t believe the group’s good fortune. “Initially when we started, it was just us playing. We were just practicing and jamming and having fun with it,” he said. “Every once in a while, we’d end a song and we noticed people were clapping.

It didn’t.”While it may be a sticker shock for many, “from the health system perspective, if remdesivir can shorten duration of hospitalization by four days, then the medicine provides a reasonable value,” Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, said in an email.O’Day said that shortening hospitalization saves about $12,000 per patient. Gilead says it will have spent $1 billion on developing and making the drug by the end of this year. Gilead shares rose 64 cents to $75.22 in late-morning trading.The drug has emergency use authorization in the U.S. and Gilead has applied for full approval.Jefferies pharmaceuticals analyst Michael Yee wrote to investors that Gilead’s price was a bit above what stock brokers were expecting.

We’re slowly managing to get through this crisis, but we need to be prepared for the next one. This is not an area where we can afford to cut corners.

At Stamford Bridge, Willian and Christian Pulisic have restarted strongly, while Frank Lampard got the better of Pep Guardiola in midweek by bringing Tammy Abraham off the bench and instructing his players to launch long balls over the top of the Manchester City defence for Abraham and Pulisic to chase. They stretched the game and turned it in Chelsea’s favour.

The AlarmPhone volunteers are hearing about attacks of this nature more and more often. The following morning, on June 5, another boat got into distress with 19 refugees on board. One of them was 16-year-old Farhad (Ed. note: name changed) from Afghanistan. He told us he had fled with his mother and sister, but had lost them both on the way to Turkey. Now he is alone, and trying to get to Europe. He worked in a Turkish factory for four months to earn the money to pay the smugglers.

Hours after Farhad called the emergency hotline on June 5, their boat was still drifting on the water, gradually deflating. Farhad told us that, instead of coming to their assistance, Greek patrol boats drove past them, very close, trying to make waves that would wash the disabled boat back into Turkish waters. Eventually the refugees were so exhausted that they stopped paddling. By the time they were finally rescued by the Turkish coast guard, there was hardly any air left in the back of their boat. Back in Turkey, we spoke to 16-year-old Farhad. His voice was shaking; he was distressed, frustrated and despondent. This had been his fifth failed attempt.

BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Angela Merkel met Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron for talks as Germany prepares to take over the European Union presidency. The start of the six-month rotating presidency on July 1 comes as the 27-nation bloc faces the massive challenge of trying to get economies back on track and restore freedom of movement between countries while not sparking a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Merkel on the weekend said she was convinced Europe could overcome the challenges even though the coronavirus continued to be a threat, and that EU economic recovery measures need to be passed as quickly as possible. Merkel and Macron in May proposed creating a one-off 500 billion-euro ($561 billion) recovery fund that would be filled through shared EU borrowing. That proposal was expanded upon by the EU's executive Commission, which put forward plans for a 750 billion- euro fund made up mostly of grants. It's facing resistance from some countries, however, that oppose grants and are reluctant to give out funds with no strings attached. Merkel and Macron appeared at ease as they met at a German government villa outside Berlin, chatting as they walked through the garden before sitting down at a small table outside and talking in the afternoon sun. In addition to the upcoming plans for the German EU presidency, the two leaders were expected to talk about multiple other issues, including relations with China, the U.S. and migration policy.
