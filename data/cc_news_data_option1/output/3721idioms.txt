Sky reporter Ivor Bennett said the test centre was "the epicentre of the traffic jam from hell. For miles around, for hours on end, there was gridlock in every direction".
 He explained: "The reason was because hundreds of people were queuing for a test centre, that to all intents and purposes, didn't exist.
 "A single trestle table was set up, under a gazebo, in a car park behind Lewisham Town Hall. But instead of swabbing people there, men in orange hi-vis vests were waving people away at the entrance.
 "Booking a test online, they said, was not enough. They wanted a QR too, which almost no one had. The one man who claimed he did, was told the centre had closed. The time was 3.40pm.
 "There were people who'd travelled from across the South East - Southampton, Harlow, Tunbridge Wells, Maidenhead. Frustrations boiled over as some confronted staff, whose response was always the same - 'it's not our fault'."

SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Savannah-Chatham County school leaders are busy planning for their newly approved phased approach to in-person learning. But with the return of students and staff, the board got an inside look at how they’ll handle COVID-19 when they head back to school.Going back to school in the middle of the pandemic raises several challenges about how to handle the infectious disease. But that’s something Savannah-Chatham nurses have been working on for months.Together they have been trained in contract tracing and are working alongside the CDC, DPH and a panel of local physicians. They are preparing for several different scenarios whether students come to school sick with COVID-19 like symptoms, test positive for coronavirus or are exposed to someone. Nurses say every school will be equipped with isolation rooms and have designated staff to help. They say isolation room supplies have been ordered and are set to arrive within two weeks. While right now the district does have seven vacant nurse positions, they are working hard to fill them. Nurses say education will be a big factor when students return to ensure they know about isolation, quarantine, close contacts and more. “Our goal is to educate our staff, our students, and our families," said SCCPSS District Lead Nurse Lisa Wilson. "We want to encourage accountability for all participating in face to face learning, we must shoulder this weight together and most of all we want to empower our district to know that when the time comes that the students return we will be as ready as we can possibly be.”Nurses also explained to the board they will monitor cases for clusters which could lead to closures whether just a class, wing or school, but that would be determined based on each situation.Copyright 2020 WTOC.

“The kids are sitting close. There is a level of community that you cannot establish as well when you are social distancing,” she said.
 Having students close while teaching is a classroom management tool, Isaacson said.
 “That’s something that good teachers use. Just by sharing space with a kid helps them focus and pay attention. When we’re socially distant, that’s not possible,” Isaacson said.
 This year, she is in search of a new way to do that.
 “It’s definitely presented some new challenges. We’re figuring it out as we go,” she said.
 Instead of sitting together on the carpet to share a book with the students, she has found larger books to share that students can see from a distance.
 Part of the new normal is wearing masks when students cannot be socially distant from others. The Meade School District started the 2020-21 school year in a phase that requires face coverings for students K-12 and staff when social distancing is not an option.
 “They are good about masking up. I think the kids know that you keep your distance so you don’t spread germs,” she said.
 Students bring their own masks to wear. They have lanyards to which they attach their masks and are responsible for placing them on and taking them off. The lanyards stay in the classroom.

ROWAN COUNTY, N.C. (WBTV) - The remnants of Sally made driving treacherous on I-85 during the midday on Thursday in Rowan County. The storm dumped rain that created standing water across the road. There were several accidents and the interstate was shut down at least three different times.Expecting heavy rain, work crews for the City of Salisbury cleared out areas likely to flood, like around a large pipe and creek on Green Street. What a backhoe could not reach, workers were able to remove by hand to keep the water flowing without obstruction.It was a different story on the interstate, where there’s not a lot of preparation for a sudden heavy downpour that puts standing water across all of the lanes.“These conditions on this kind of roadway are ripe for hydroplaning," said Nick Martin, a Battallion Chief for the Salisbury Fire Department.At one point while firefighters and emergency responders were helping the victim of one accident near E. Innes Street, a Mercedes hydroplaned and bounced twice off the concrete barrier just a few yards away.There were injuries reported, but most were said to be minor.A short time later there was another crash three miles up the interstate that, once again, meant all southbound lanes were closed for a time.Drivers said conditions were terrible. “Yes, getting on the highway my car was sliding left and right," one driver said.For about an hour firefighters and emergency responders went from one crash to another on I-85, going from the Rowan and Davidson County line, all the way to China Grove near Cabarrus County.The interstate was shut down in one direction or the other at least three times.“Any time we have this amount of rainfall, they’re changing very rapidly, all drivers should be using caution, slowing down, and paying attention to their surroundings," Martin added.Copyright 2020 WBTV.

At one point, she looked at me and said, "Why are you smiling?"
 Not realizing I was smiling, I just looked at her and said, "I'm enjoying that wonderful music."
 “Well, stop it and help me find where that tree frog is.”
 We never did find that tree frog that night. It sang all night long, and when I got up in the morning, it was just finishing its concert.
 For the next several nights, that tree frog entertained us with its musical concert. I enjoyed it while my wife despised it.
 I guess that’s the difference between people. One person enjoys the music while the other person looks at it as noise. What is the real difference between music and noise?
 The only difference is the person listening. Since I do not have any musical credibility, I can listen to a tree frog singing and enjoy it as a beautiful musical concert.
 On the other hand, my wife is very musically adept and can tell what is musical and what is simply noise.
 A few days later, my wife got up, came into the living room, and asked, "Where is that noise?"
 "Oh," I said rather cheerfully, "you mean the musical concert we enjoyed for the last several nights."
 She looked at me with one of her looks.
 “I think the tree frog has finished its concert and has moved on to its next engagement.”
 For a moment, I was a little sorry because I enjoyed all the music from that tree frog. If up to me, and it isn't, I would engage that tree frog for a concert every night.
 Last night as we were sitting in the living room, my wife said, “Isn’t that wonderful?”
 Not knowing what she meant, I asked her, and she said, "that aggravating noise from the tree frog is gone. I really enjoy the quiet."
 For a moment, I wanted to reply, "I really enjoyed the tree frog concert." I knew that would not be the proper thing to say at a time like this. There is a time when you can agree on something. We don't have to agree on everything, but we need to agree on that which is important.
 Amos, the Old Testament prophet, said it this way, “Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” (Amos 3:3).
 Throughout my life, I have discovered that the important thing is not what you disagree about but rather what you agree on, and that brings you together.

That's the way it is now. Those memories of high school days are similar to mine. Probably most of us have not found politics that fascinating. Just something that comes around periodically. We have to study and make a decision. I am independent and have voted either party based on what I felt was the best choice. I voted for Obama the first time. Not the second, but he was in for round 2. Then I voted for Trump and will again. I found out that I am a racist for supporting Trump. What was I when I voted for Obama? Some people have become completely unhinged. They have bought their disappointment at the loss of the Democrat candidate and how different from the current president is from career politicians, they cannot get over their loss. I figured they would go back to the drawing board and find a good candidate for next time. Instead they spent the last 4 years (it started during the campaign) trying to creating crisis after crisis to salve their wounded egos. All that energy and treasure wasted that could have been used to build a better country. Left liberal media bias has fanned this irrational anger to a city burning inferno. People are polarized like never before. It is sad. Maybe the right song to remember (I hate to say this) is 'Eve Of Destruction'. I support Rodney King's later comment, 'Can't we all just get along?'

I would now like to focus on a topic that illustrates how closely international markets and policy have become connected - payments for research and the requirements of MiFID II.  As you know, MiFID II, by changing how asset managers could pay for research in the E.U., raised questions concerning compliance among U.S. broker-dealers and asset managers.[3]  Over the last several years, these firms have been navigating the changing landscape of business practice and regulatory requirements.  In order to assist firms with these challenges, Division staff issued no-action letters in October 2017 addressing the impact on the broker-dealer exclusion when an asset manager pays for research using hard dollars.  This position, while time-limited, was extended until July 2023 in light of the fact that business practices after the implementation of MiFID II were continuing to evolve.

“If this passes, most of our schools are in the same boat, they don’t want to see realignment given short shrift,” DeBoard said. “They seem pretty much on board for postponing. If we do that, we’ll probably place those schools, and maybe make two or three other changes.”
 In the meantime, with the NFL completing its first week of play, and some colleges moving forward with the fall football season, DeBoard said the section and the CIF are keeping an eye on how things develop.
 “What we’re looking closer at, you know, the professional leagues are able to pretty much isolate — the NBA’s playing in a full bubble, NFL and baseball being real cautious,” DeBoard said. “It’s tougher for high school kids, because they have to be in school. They’re going to be associated with other kids.”
 What he said California is keeping a closer eye on is the 14 states that are holding fall sports, with another 16 or 17 planning to start in the coming weeks.
 “Those guys, for lack of a better word, are kind of the guinea pigs,” DeBoard said. “What we’ve seen in those 14 states is eight of them have seen a bit of a spike, and six of them have seen a drop.”
 It has been somewhat messy as far as scheduling, with an estimated 85% of games being played in those states, according to DeBoard.
 “What we’re seeing a lot of is School A supposed to play School B, but they can’t play because someone gets sick. Meanwhile School C and School D get canceled, so School A and School C pick up a game against each other,” DeBoard said. “It’s a little messy, and probably how things will look if California gets going. I think it will take a lot of luck for schools to get all of their football games in.”

La policía de Racine, ciudad de Wisconsin (Estados Unidos), está intentando determinar qué es exactamente y de dónde vino lo que parece ser un cerebro hallado el pasado 15 de septiembre en una playa de Samuel Myers Park. El hallazgo fue realizado por Jimmy Senda, un constructor y artista de 47 años que recorre las playas cercanas al lago Michigan para buscar artículos como cristal marino, los cuales incorpora posteriormente en algunas de sus esculturas. “Me encontré con este paquete cuadrado, envuelto en aluminio, y alrededor tenía una banda de goma rosa“, contó el hombre a Fox News 6. “La curiosidad se apoderó de mi, así que lo abrí y parecía una pechuga de pollo, algo así. Me tomó un poco de tiempo darme cuenta de qué estaba pasando; era un cerebro”. Algunas flores y lo que parece ser papel con letras en mandarín también fueron encontrados junto al cerebro. Senda publicó algunas fotos que tomó del hallazgo y las publicó en Facebook, llamando la atención de cientos de internautas rápidamente. Los agentes que llegaron hasta el lugar dijeron que no creen que el órgano sea humano, pero que la Oficina de Médico Forense del Condado de Racine se pronunciará pronto a través de un comunicado. Senda, por su parte, asegura sentirse feliz por el descubrimiento. “Hay un montón de niños y familias por aquí. ¿Qué hubiera pasado si un niño lo encontraba”, dijo.

I understand the calls from issuers and investors for a nice, neat set of ESG metrics, but I suspect that the reality would not be as wonderful as some advocates imagine. First, a prescriptive ESG framework would run directly counter to our tried and true principles-based disclosure framework, which is rooted in materiality, rather than specific metrics. This principles-based framework is a significant source of strength for our capital markets. As a securities regulator, I see it as part of my job to defend our principles- based disclosure framework from attacks, even well intentioned ones that are clothed in "this time really is different" rhetoric. If we allow our disclosure regime to address the specific desires of each special interest group, we will increase the costs of being a public company, weaken our focus on investor protection, and stray from our agency's mission. Under the existing framework, companies should be disclosing specific ESG measures that management uses to evaluate the company's results and prospects. For example, our MD&A disclosure requirements require narrative disclosure enabling investors to see a registrant through the eyes of management.[2] Additionally, we recently amended the business description requirement to include, to the extent material, a description of a registrant's human capital resources, including any human capital measures or objectives that the registrant focuses on in managing the business.[3] Moreover, I would expect that companies are regularly considering disclosures, ESG or otherwise, provided by their competitors when determining whether they are properly evaluating their business and providing material information to investors.

WASHINGTON – Federal health officials told a Senate panel Wednesday, Sept. 16, that limited amounts of a COVID-19 vaccine could be available as early as November – but that doesn’t mean Arizonans are willing to try it.A poll this week of likely Arizona voters showed them evenly split, with 38% saying they would get vaccinated and 38% saying they would refuse a vaccine. The remaining 23% said they were unsure in the poll by OH Predictive Insights.“The public is going to need some convincing to take a vaccine when the time comes,” said Mike Noble, chief of research and managing partner of the polling firm.The likelihood of getting vaccinated rose for older respondents in Arizona and for a vaccine that was produced in the U.S.&nbsp;The survey&nbsp;of 600 likely voters was taken from Sept. 8-10 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4%.The Arizona numbers are in stark contrast to a by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist&nbsp;Poll last month&nbsp;that found 60% of people nationwide would get vaccinated, 35% would not and only 5% who said they were unsure.That choice could come as soon as later this year, said Centers for Disease Control Prevention Director Robert Redfield during testimony Wednesday on “Operation Warp Speed,” the government’s vaccine- development program.Redfield told a&nbsp;Senate Appropriations&nbsp;subcommittee that a COVID-19 vaccine might be available to a prioritized few, such as first responders and health care workers, as early as November. But the vaccine will not be widely distributed until the second or third quarter of 2021, he said.“I think we have to assume that if we had a vaccine say, released today, that it’s going to take us probably in the order of nine months – six to nine months – to get the American public vaccinated,”&nbsp;Redfield testified.RELATED STORYState pushes flu vaccine to avert flu-and-COVID-19 ‘perfect storm’Redfield said the CDC is working with health departments in North Dakota, California, Minnesota, Florida and Philadelphia, to come up with a prioritized distribution plan for the vaccine. In a statement Wednesday, the Department of Health and Human Services said the overall goal of Operation Warp Speed is to “produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial doses available by January 2021.”But John Banzhaf, a public interest law professor at George Washington University, worries that a rushed vaccine could be dangerous. He said it normally takes two or more years for the trials and safety regulations before a vaccine is ready for production.“It’s important to realize that there are many different problems if this thing isn’t adequately tested before release and it isn’t tested by some independent party,” said Banzhaf, who said others have worried about the pace of development and Redfield’s role in it.“I think many people are beginning to doubt his reliability and begin to suspect that he may be under the influence of the president,” Banzhaf said. “And whether and to what extent that may be affecting his judgement. Many people are worried.”Noble said politics also appeared to play a role in how Arizonans felt about the pandemic, with just 24% of Republican voters “extremely or moderately concerned about the spread” of COVID-19. But 87% of Democrats were concerned about the spread of the disease, as were 59% of independent voters.“COVID is a unique issue in the sense that it doesn’t care what your political party affiliation is, your education level, your ethnicity,” Noble said. "And yet the numbers are pretty clear that it’s definitely turned into a political football when the issue doesn’t really care about it.“A lot of folks are really unsure, so if there was a vaccine today, you’d assume, ‘Oh hey, we’ll all be good,’” he said. “However, due to this partisanship, I think a lot of people are weary on it, but also unsure and there’s kind of a ‘wait and see’ approach, due to the politicization of it.”Redfield testified that the Food and Drug Administration has said it will approve a vaccine that proves to be “50% efficacious,” a threshold similar to what it requires for a flu vaccine. But there will still be hurdles to getting people vaccinated even then.“I do want to be clear that as soon as this vaccine gets approved, we want to be in a position to distribute that within 24 hours,” Redfield said. “This vaccine has the potential to save a lot of lives in November and December, but we need to be able to get that vaccine once its approved. We need to distribute it as rapidly as we can.”Copyright 2020 Cronkite News/Arizona Board of Regents. All rights reserved.

I didn’t know what she was talking about. I asked her to tell me what noise she was referring to.
 “Listen,” she whispered, “don’t you hear that noise?”
 I must say one of my problems is that although I listen, I most often don't hear. There is supposed to be a connection between listening and hearing, but it doesn't always work with me. I guess I'm wired differently than my wife.
 When they say men and women are equal, they obviously have never been married. Both men and women have their eccentricities. Mine is more obvious than my wife's.
 A husband soon discovers after his marriage that there is a major difference between him and his bride. It takes him a while to unscramble it and figure out how to deal with it.
 As I tried to listen, I couldn't hear what she was hearing. And then I heard it. Somewhere in our living room, a tree frog invited himself to provide us with one of his concerts. There's nothing I like better at night than listening to a tree frog singing its latest song.
 “That’s not aggravating noise,” I replied, “that’s a tree frog singing a musical concert for us.”
 "It is not music," my wife uttered, "it is aggravating noise, and we need to get rid of it right now."
 Now, if anybody knows anything about music, it is my wife. She plays the piano, the organ, the guitar, the flute, and many times she plays me. But that's a different story.
 For me, I don't have a musical background. If you ever heard me singing, you would understand.
 When I first met my wife, she was singing in a musical group. They did a great job and traveled church to church on weekends. So, she can sing very well.
 Never once have I even entertained the idea of her and I singing a duet.
 “Where is that aggravating noise coming from?”
 I learned that when my wife asks a question to be very careful in my response. I'm not saying that she sets before me trick questions, she does, but I'm not saying that.
 She searched all through the living room to find this singing tree frog for the rest of the evening. Never once did the music stop while she was searching. I just sat back and enjoyed the concert.

The costs of failing to harmonize are high, as swap dealers and other reporting parties must provide entirely different data sets to multiple regulators for the very same swap.[24]  A better approach is to conform swap data reporting requirements where possible.

It is with sad hearts but many happy memories that we say goodbye to our beloved Mother, Grandmother, and Great Grandmother, Faye Vannoy, who passed away on September 8, 2020, after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. We are blessed with the comfort of knowing that, although Faye became progressively worse from this dreaded condition, she spent her last few years in a remarkably happy state of mind. Perhaps some of that happiness came from a deeper knowledge that she would someday be joining her beloved husband, Bob Vannoy, who died nearly 45 years earlier. What an amazing couple they made, this young pair from Oklahoma, with their movie-star good looks and the energy which flowed from the accomplishments of their great generation and the promise of things to come. They made their way to Louisiana in the early 50's and built their family in Cajun Country. When she lost Bob at such an early age, no one really believed she would ever marry again - and she didn't. No one could compare. This is not to say that "Faye-Bird," as her many close friends loved to call her, didn't continue to be a stunning beauty and to live an adventuresome and fruitful life of nearly 89 years. She remained engaged in the raucous, oil-boom culture of her beloved adopted home of Lafayette. She worked and played (Oakbourne, Lafonda's, and many other memorable venues come to mind) among those who loved her and her late husband and who remained devoted to her through the years. Her skills on the golf course were well known, and she and her buddies were for many years a colorful feature of the "19th Hole." As Faye began to decline, she moved to Baton Rouge, to be with family members who could help care for her. During those later years, she made new friends in her new environment, and time was punctuated with laughter and good company around the dinner and card tables. Her caregivers at St. James Place truly loved her, and she returned that love in her own special way. We are so very thankful for the love and care she received there. Faye is survived by her daughter, Laura V. Palmintier (Michael) and son Robert L. Vannoy II; six grandchildren and their spouses, Dominic (Lori), Joshua (Victoria), and Ellen Palmintier, Rachel Beaumont (Bobby), and Bobby (Heather) and Nick Vannoy; thirteen great-grandchildren Cameron, Bella, Kate, Trip, Violet, Reise, Rhodes, and Beckham Palmintier, Wyatt Pickering, Anthony and E.J. Beaumont, and Cole and John Luke Vannoy; sister Betty Osborn; and many nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her husband, Robert L. Vannoy I; parents, Jessie Womack Haney and Vivian Womack; grandchildren Nicole Vannoy and Robert "Blake" Palmintier; brother J.C. Womack and wife Vivian; brother Wavel Womack; sister Mildred Sexton and husband Bo; and brother-in-law Bill Osborn. We are all her children, and we will miss her more than words can express. But Faye has left us with beautiful memories of a life well lived, and we are all grateful for having been hers. Faye will be laid to rest next to Bob in a private ceremony in October.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - The Lexington County Sheriff’s Department has arrested a 33-year-old Pelion man who is accused of shooting another man. According to authorities, William David House was fighting with the man at a home on Pelion Road when House shot the man. House told deputies he shot the man in self-defense. Investigators later learned that House put the man into a truck after he was shot and dropped him off in a wooded area off Bushberry Road. Officials said House did not render aid to the man or call law enforcement about the shooting. “The twists and turns of the case led us to North, South Carolina where this became a joint investigation with the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office, the Richland County Coroner’s Office, the Lexington County Coroner’s Office and SLED,” Koon said. “The man’s remains and truck were found in North after House moved the victim a second time from Bushberry Road.”Authorities said the victim has not been positively identified at this time. House has been held in the Lexington County Detention Center after an arrest on September 10 on an unrelated charge.Copyright 2020 WIS. All rights reserved.

So we had the added complication of finding a platform that we could use so that we can deliver content … That’s going to allow us to film our productions, and then we do a lot of editing in post-production. Then we’re going to be able to upload that and people can watch the shows from the comfort of their own homes, right in watch parties or individually. This is going to allow us to move forward, giving the students the performance opportunities, and also through the filming process. It’s going to allow them to have those experiences with individual takes to say [lines], adjust the way that they go about the scene, then think about it, then go back and take another take. That’s actually part of the pedagogic experience that they get in a normal stage production from weekend one to weekend two, when they have all of the middle part of the week they can think about what they’ve done, make adjustments._

 I don’t believe Donald Trump is the problem. He is what he is. The problem is the irresponsibility of the American voter. In 2016, Donald Trump was not qualified to be president of the United States in any category. If you voted for him because you thought he would “shake up” the governing of the U.S. or you didn’t like Hillary Clinton’s attitude: shame on you. We could lose this country.
