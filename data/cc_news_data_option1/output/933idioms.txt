_The only ones "weaponizing visas" were the WSJ "journalists", not the Chinese government. These individuals, possibly at the behest of their employer (it's not yet clear whether they were acting on their own initiative or at the orders of their company's top staff), deceived the authorities about their intended actions in the country and abused their journalist visas in order to carry out political activities. In order to ensure journalistic integrity and ethics, China had no choice but to punish them for what they did so as to send a message to others that it won't turn a blind eye towards foreigners breaking its laws and defiling their profession._

Vikings were able to adapt some of these myths to the Christian views of Doomsday, and Viking art, particularly in the tenth century, reflects the mixture of Christianity and pagan beliefs. However, we should bear in mind that much of what is written about pagan Viking beliefs comes from the 13th- century pen of Snorri Sturluson, a Christian Icelander who was interested in making sense of the beliefs of his pagan ancestors in a way that played down what must have been many local variations in religious beliefs and practice.
