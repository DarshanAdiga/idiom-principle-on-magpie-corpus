PEORIA -- In a climate of the unknown, something unexpected has happened for the Peoria Rivermen.
 Something wonderful.
 When the SPHL shut down the 2019-20 season in March because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the Rivermen still had three home games left on their schedule.
 Season ticket holders and businesses had to be contacted to address what to do about those remaining games.
 "They told us to keep the money," Rivermen co-owner Bart Rogers said. "It's just been stunning. I would say 90 percent of our fans have said they don't want a refund. They want to support the team, they want to help the team survive.
 "They tell us to keep the money. We are blessed. Without these fans, we don't survive. We've never asked them to do this, never been in this situation before.
 "But they just do it."
 It has become a pay-it-forward scenario. Some fans, and some groups that were booked for those final three games, have opted for gift cards or credit toward tickets next season. Most have just walked away from the money.
 "We understand everyone's financial situation is different," Rogers said. "We respect any way they want to be taken care of."
 All of them will be invited to join the team in a special celebration with the staff and players next season as a way of thanking them for their support.
 The Rivermen front office has spent the COVID-19 shutdown with their offices closed, but with staff working from home trying to serve their season ticket holders.
 Even with the economy shut down, the Rivermen have encountered some area businesses, like Wingstop and Joy Maynor Allstate and Peoria Motors, who have already committed to support the team for next season.
 Whenever next season starts and however many games it lasts.
 "Our staff is going through this tedious process from our makeshift home offices and has been overwhelmed with appreciation from our season ticket base, as well as casual fans who are not as connected to our team just telling us to keep the money they have coming back to make sure Rivermen hockey can move forward to the future," Rogers said. "That gesture in a time like this is just incredible and very humbling, shows the good in this world."
 The Rivermen lost substantial revenue from their three cancelled games. Other teams in the SPHL are in far worse shape, with more home games cancelled. Some may have lost in the low to mid six figures.
 It's possible -- likely -- that not every SPHL team will survive to return for the 2020-21 season. The Rivermen will.
 "I can't underestimate how big of a financial impact this is on our team as well as all other teams at all levels of amateur and professional hockey," Rogers said. "We were the very first industry to have our doors shut and our businesses shut down by the State of Illinois.
 "Every day that goes by is thousands of dollars worth of expense with zero revenue going to offset. It's a very scary situation for all of America and small businesses like the Peoria Rivermen.
 "Our team has existed for 38 years, Peoria is one of the longest continuously operating minor league hockey markets in North America.
 "We have been very fortunate in this great community to have the backing of corporate partners as well as season ticket holders and casual fans.
 "Once this is over with and we are back up and in business, we are going to need that same support, and then some, to be able to operate as we always have been accustomed to."

MUMBAI — Farhan Akhtar’s unbelievable look with his physique as a boxer, has again set new benchmarks for “Toofaan.” In real life as well, Akhtar is known to maintain great discipline and regime with his fitness. He has never explored the non-fitness route, but with “Toofaan,” he is setting a new high.
 To portray the part of a competitive sportsperson, Akhtar has undergone major body transformation and has trained in professional boxing. He first had to lose weight and build a physique to look the part. After that, he had to undo all of that for a portion in the film that required him to put on 15 kilos in six weeks. His body transition from fit to heavy was a massive challenge for his team and him to overcome.
 About his journey, he says, “For me, fitness is a way of life and not just a routine. Irrespective of my craft, I choose to live a healthy and disciplined lifestyle. I’ve always refrained from indulging in things that could have adverse effects on my body. It was a challenge for me to adapt to a way of living that was completely contrary—with monitored exercise regime, less physical activity and high consumption of fats, carbs and starch. It was tough. Although I balanced consumption of fried food, the starch and fats made up for it and here you go, that’s how I gained an extra 15 kilos!”
 It is certainly no child’s play to fluctuate between different body weights and transformations, but Akhtar has left no stone unturned when it comes to his commitment for a character.
 Previously, he had essayed the role of Milkha Singh in “Bhaag Milkha Bhaag” (2013). This time, the film has been shot across Mumbai at real locations like the Dongri slums and the Gateway of India. “Toofaan” also stars Mrunal Thakur and Paresh Rawal.
 With all the insights from his trainers into his training sessions, Akhtar has been keeping his fans by Excel Entertainment and directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. It is an Excel Entertainment production in association with ROMP Pictures.

Regulation could change to support innovation. Innovative technology-based companies and their investors may not be able to help the industry solve its problems at the necessary pace unless there is some rationalization of regulatory and licensing regimes to facilitate greater investment. In light of this, regulators and lawmakers will need to consider how to evolve processes and associated costs to facilitate increased investment in innovation without diminishing consumer and jurisdictional protections. Jurisdictions that optimize around regulation and the needs of their gaming enterprises will benefit the most.

If you are feeling particularly overwhelmed, especially by not knowing when shelter-in-place orders will end, Vincent suggested breaking the time into smaller chunks. One idea is to look at the coming week and set specific goals.
 “Figure out how to make the most of those days, rather than looking at an endless expanse of time,” she said. “Make a goal to try something new at home or get in touch with people. Set some things to look forward to each week.”
 Brown said entering each day with a positive mindset can also work wonders. She recommended people wake up early and set aside 30 minutes for reflection, meditation and focus.
 “Use that time to set the tone for the day,” Brown said. “I love affirmations. I go into my day expecting it to be a great day. Tell yourself you are resilient and you can handle what comes your way.”
 Brown said she considers movement a sixth sense that can have major benefits. Dancing to your favorite music can improve your mood and release endorphins. Although gyms are closed, Brown noted there are ways to get in good workouts at home.
 “You can do pushups, sit-ups, jumping jacks and all kinds of exercises,” she said. “A lot of people are also doing streaming classes that you can join. There are so many ways to incorporate that movement, and that’s going to help you focus on keeping calm.”
 Once restrictions are lifted, Vincent cautioned it will take a while for people to re-adjust. Feelings of stress, anxiety and hesitation about going out in public will be common, she said.
 “We can’t slam the brakes on our lives and resume at a race car speed once the flag goes back up,” she said. “It’s going to take most people some time before they really feel that things are back to normal and they can resume a normal life. We expect that, and it’s absolutely normal to have those feelings.”

 William E. Young, 82, passed peacefully from this life on Friday, April 3, 2020. He was in the comfort of his home, surrounded by the love of his family. Born to Annabelle and Henry Young in 1937, he was raised on his family's dairy farm in Brushton, NY. Over the course of his life Bill would find his one true love and enjoy a life rich with the blessings of faith, family and friends. Although he traveled extensively, his favorite place to be was with those he loved the most. Following graduation from St. Joseph's Academy in Malone, NY, he attended St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont where he received a Bachelor's degree in Economics. Bill entered the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1960 where he successfully competed for entry into and completed the rigors of the USAF pilot training program at Laredo AFB, Texas. He would go on to become a flight instructor in the T-38, a squadron flight commander, an operations officer, 12th AF Chief of Safety and finally the Deputy Director & Division Chief for Joint Services Training Exercises for the USAF's Tactical Air Command (TAC) now designated as the Air Combat Command (ACC). Throughout his 22 years of committed service, Bill proudly served both state-side and overseas. During the Vietnam War , Bill was a forward air controller with the Army's 25th Infantry Division. Later he flew the F-111 as pilot-in-command on combat missions in Thailand. Bill received both the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Bronze Star Medal for conspicuous gallantry demonstrated during multiple missions against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces. Also while on active duty and true to his nature of always seeking excellence, Bill earned his Master's Degree in Human Resources Management from Pepperdine University. He continued his drive to further his education and civilian employment opportunities. Upon retirement he returned to school for his Bachelor's Degree in Accounting and Finance from Christopher Newport College. One of his proudest moments following his military career was completing the requirements to become a Certified Public Accountant. From staff accountant to Corporate Controller to Accounting Manager, Bill worked diligently making significant impacts on the profitability and financial success of various companies including Marva Maid Dairies, Flight International and Bionetics Corporation. He served several years as the Financial Accounting Manager and earned the distinction of Certified Fraud Examiner while with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). Bill remained with VDOT until he officially retired in 2007. Upon full retirement from VDOT, he enjoyed time with the love of his life, Barbara Ann (Beech) Young, his wife of 55 years. They embarked on many wonderful cruises and had great stories to tell once back home again. When not traveling, Bill was always ready to play a round of golf with family and friends. The years he spent as a member of the Peninsula Retired Men's Club were very special to him, and he treasured the friendships he made in that group. He proudly served as a Deacon among his faith family at First Presbyterian Church of Hampton. While at home, Bill and Barbara would often be found tending to yard beautification as well as enjoying various performances at the Virginia Symphony and Smith field Little Theatre. Bill also enjoyed a good book in the comfort of his recliner with his beloved lap cat, Zoe. Bill delighted his family with that special twinkle in his eye, a great smile on his face, and a wonderfully unique sense of humor and spirit. True to form, he was always a willing contributor to any lively discussion and was a great source of sage advice and wisdom. His family will fondly remember Bill for his extraordinary faith, love and sacrifice as their patriarch. He was preceded in death by his mother, Annabelle (Bassett) Young, his father, Henry William Young, and his brother, Harold Henry Young. He is survived by his wife, Barbara Young of Hampton; his son, Kevin (and wife Judy) of Smyrna, GA; his daughter, Karen (and husband James Binniker) of Bristow, VA and his four grandchildren, Blair, Skyler, Brendan and Ryan; his sister-in-law, Nancy Young of Gaithersburg, MD and several beloved nieces and nephews. The family expresses deep gratitude to the staff of Personal Touch Hospice Care, Bayada Home Health and Dr. Scott Kruger of Virginia Oncology Associates for their diligent and compassionate attention to Bill's end-of-life care in the comfort of his home. The immediate family will hold a private service to honor his life. There will be a celebration of life service to include extended family and friends that will be scheduled for a later date. R. Hayden Smith Funeral Home and First Presbyterian Church of Hampton will be assisting the family with necessary arrangements. According to his wishes, Bill will be laid to rest with full military honors and an interment ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery. The family will announce the date of this ceremony once they finalize coordination with the Arlington staff. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation on Bill's behalf to First Presbyterian Church, 514 S. Armistead Ave., Hampton, VA 23669 ( firstpreshampton.org ).

"I feel lucky I don't have the really scary symptoms," the 33-year-old author says. However, she describes her loss of the sense of smell, or anosmia, as "one of the most upsetting things I've ever gone through because you're not in the driving seat.... I just feel really powerless and scared."
 Aside from the psychological impact of believing you've caught a deadly virus, and how losing your sense of smell strips joy from eating food, anosmia can also be dangerous.
 As Bourne discovered when her boyfriend asked why a plastic margarine tub was melting on the stove in their London home. She had her back turned while making sandwiches and couldn't detect the synthetic burning smell.
 Like the dozens of people experiencing loss of smell that CNN has spoken to for this article, with a lack of official health authority advice available, Bourne turned to Google and social media for answers. She shared what she found in a thread on Twitter, where some people are reporting their sense of smell still hasn't returned after three or four weeks.
 The thing many people experiencing new-onset anosmia or hyposmia -- a partial smell loss -- during the coronavirus pandemic want to know is how long is it going to last? Will it be permanent?
 The answer, according to Professor Steven Munger, Director of the University of Florida's Center for Smell and Taste, is unknown.
 "What we've known for a long time is one of the major causes of smell loss are upper respiratory tract infections due to viruses -- a common cold, influenza -- a subset of people lose their sense of smell, most of them temporarily, but a small subset lose that smell permanently," Munger tells CNN.
 For a sense of smell to return, "it might take days, it might take weeks, sometimes it even takes months to years on rare occasions. Sometimes it's gradual, sometimes it is all at once and we don't really know why that is," he adds.
 "I'm at almost two weeks now and about 70% of my sense of smell has returned. One nostril is doing better than the other nostril," Bourne says.
 Mark Driver, a 55-year-old winemaker from London, began to feel unwell with a cough, sore throat and mild temperature after coming into contact with a former colleague who has since tested positive in Dubai for Covid-19. On around day 8 of Driver's sickness, he lost his sense of smell. "This coincided with very severe headaches in the front of my head, just above the eyes," he says.
 "Smell is very important to my job, so I got a little worried that it might not come back." Twenty days since he first got sick, Driver says his wine tasting is "appalling" and he still can't smell much at all.
 Sian Griffiths, 60, who normally runs a Bed and Breakfast in Argyll, Scotland, began feeling tired on March 28 and realized she had lost her sense of smell while cooking a curry the next day. "I realized I couldn't taste it, even when I inadvertently chewed a cardamom pod. This was rather disconcerting as I had no other symptoms such as a blocked nose," she says.
 Like many others in the UK, she followed government guidelines and did not contact her local health service because she did not have a cough or fever. But she became concerned after a couple of days. "I tried sticking my nose right into a jar of coffee -- nothing. Whisky -- nothing. Frying bacon -- not a hint."
 "Eating anything was most unpleasant, even repellent because I couldn't be sure that what I was eating was actually food," Griffiths adds.
 The question about whether people are experiencing smell loss or taste loss comes down to the scientific or colloquial use of the word taste, Munger says. "When scientists talk about taste they are talking about what you can detect in your mouth that gives you a sensation -- sweetness, saltiness, bitterness, sourness, or umami (savoury). But taste plus smell is what your brain puts together to create flavor function," Munger explains.
 Griffiths noticed how losing her sense of smell meant she could no longer tell if food had gone off, saying "it's almost automatic to sniff a bottle of milk before pouring just in case it's on the turn." Speaking on what is day 12 without her full sense of smell, Griffiths says: "I now have slight hints of it returning. Almost as if some molecules are getting through. I caught a whiff of fresh paint where I had been painting woodwork a few days previously... I would say I have about 10% smell and taste now."
 Amy Walker, 30, a finance and business manager from London, felt like she had come down with a bad cold and lost her sense of smell on March 18 -- more than three weeks ago.
 "I was extremely lethargic, going from my bed to the toilet felt like I had run a marathon," she recalls. Walker had come into contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus and called the NHS helpline but after spending a long time on hold, figured that because her symptoms weren't affecting her respiratory system she should just follow the advice given on the NHS website.
 "The taste and smell both went together. I'm in recovery for an eating disorder that I've had for over half of my life and the loss of taste is an extremely triggering thing for me psychologically -- it immediately made me feel utterly miserable," Walker says.
 "It brought back fears of food and an attitude of 'Well I can't taste it so what's the point of eating anything?' " she adds. "Being confined and so exhausted with those two senses taken away from you whilst there was panic and fear mongering everywhere was beyond draining."
 Walker says her sense of taste and smell is now at around 50%, however, having a slight bit of taste and smell come back and then have no further progress has made her wonder if she's "now stuck like this".
 One ENT doctor leading the charge to get loss of sense of smell recognized by the World Health Organization as a coronavirus symptom is Claire Hopkins, President of the British Rhinological Society.
 Hopkins pushed for loss of sense of smell to be included in a coronavirus symptom-tracking mobile app developed by King's College London. Subsequently, on April, 1 King's reported its research found loss of sense of smell or taste is a stronger predictor of coronavirus infection than fever. Out of 400,000 people in the UK reporting one or more symptoms between March 24-29, 18% had lost their sense of smell or taste and 10.5% were suffering from fever.

William E. Young, 82, passed peacefully from this life on Friday, April 3, 2020. He was in the comfort of his home, surrounded by the love of his family. Born to Annabelle and Henry Young in 1937, he was raised on his family's dairy farm in Brushton, NY. Over the course of his life Bill would find his one true love and enjoy a life rich with the blessings of faith, family and friends. Although he traveled extensively, his favorite place to be was with those he loved the most.      Following graduation from St. Joseph's Academy in Malone, NY, he attended St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont where he received a Bachelor's degree in Economics. Bill entered the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1960 where he successfully competed for entry into and completed the rigors of the USAF pilot training program at Laredo AFB, Texas. He would go on to become a flight instructor in the T-38, a squadron flight commander, an operations officer, 12th AF Chief of Safety and finally the Deputy Director & Division Chief for Joint Services Training Exercises for the USAF's Tactical Air Command (TAC) now designated as the Air Combat Command (ACC). Throughout his 22 years of committed service, Bill proudly served both state-side and overseas. During the Vietnam War, Bill was a forward air controller with the Army's 25th Infantry Division. Later he flew the F-111 as pilot-in-command on combat missions in Thailand. Bill received both the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Bronze Star Medal for conspicuous gallantry demonstrated during multiple missions against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces.      Also while on active duty and true to his nature of always seeking excellence, Bill earned his Master's Degree in Human Resources Management from Pepperdine University. He continued his drive to further his education and civilian employment opportunities. Upon "retirement" he returned to school for his Bachelor's Degree in Accounting and Finance from Christopher Newport College. One of his proudest moments following his military career was completing the requirements to become a Certified Public Accountant. From staff accountant to Corporate Controller to Accounting Manager, Bill worked diligently making significant impacts on the profitability and financial success of various companies including Marva Maid Dairies, Flight International and Bionetics Corporation. He served several years as the Financial Accounting Manager and earned the distinction of Certified Fraud Examiner while with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). Bill remained with VDOT until he "officially" retired in 2007.      Upon full retirement from VDOT, he enjoyed time with the love of his life, Barbara Ann (Beech) Young, his wife of 55 years. They embarked on many wonderful cruises and had great stories to tell once back home again. When not traveling, Bill was always ready to play a round of golf with family and friends. The years he spent as a member of the Peninsula Retired Men's Club were very special to him, and he treasured the friendships he made in that group. He proudly served as a Deacon among his faith family at First Presbyterian Church of Hampton. While at home, Bill and Barbara would often be found tending to yard beautification as well as enjoying various performances at the Virginia Symphony and Smithfield Little Theatre. Bill also enjoyed a good book in the comfort of his recliner with his beloved "lap" cat, Zoe. Bill delighted his family with that special twinkle in his eye, a great smile on his face, and a wonderfully unique sense of humor and spirit. True to form, he was always a willing contributor to any lively discussion and was a great source of sage advice and wisdom. His family will fondly remember Bill for his extraordinary faith, love and sacrifice as their patriarch.      He was preceded in death by his mother, Annabelle (Bassett) Young, his father, Henry William Young, and his brother, Harold Henry Young. He is survived by his wife, Barbara Young of Hampton; his son, Kevin (and wife Judy) of Smyrna, GA; his daughter, Karen (and husband James Binniker) of Bristow, VA and his four grandchildren, Blair, Skyler, Brendan and Ryan; his sister-in-law, Nancy Young of Gaithersburg, MD and several beloved nieces and nephews. The family expresses deep gratitude to the staff of Personal Touch Hospice Care, Bayada Home Health and Dr. Scott Kruger of Virginia Oncology Associates for their diligent and compassionate attention to Bill's end-of-life care in the comfort of his home.      The immediate family will hold a private service to honor his life. There will be a celebration of life service to include extended family and friends that will be scheduled for a later date. R. Hayden Smith Funeral Home and First Presbyterian Church of Hampton will be assisting the family with necessary arrangements. According to his wishes, Bill will be laid to rest with full military honors and an interment ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery. The family will announce the date of this ceremony once they finalize coordination with the Arlington staff. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation on Bill's behalf to First Presbyterian Church, 514 S. Armistead Ave., Hampton, VA 23669 (firstpreshampton.org).

"We don't have much control over everything, but we can control our reaction to it," he said. "Whatever your medium, you have to find some way to get your anxiety out. Fear feels really real, it feels really real, but it can be an illusion. We can get stuck in a mental loop.
