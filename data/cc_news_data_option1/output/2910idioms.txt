Another issue arises in the latter half of _The Rental_. Aside from the fact that the characters start making some baffling decisions, the final stretch ends up feeling awkwardly tacked on, focusing on a threat that wasn't terribly present in the earlier parts of the film and seems like it's air-dropped in from another story. As a result, those early sections feel in retrospect like they were just treading water. Even as the film starts to embrace the horror- thriller genre, it still doesn't entirely decide what it wants to be right away, mixing multiple different subgenres together. All the turns left and right, both in tone and in plot, create a sensation of whiplash. One particular twist that hastily disregards some of what was built up in favor of a new dynamic adds to the film's lack of focus, and when yet another new dynamic arrives after that, it's just too sudden.

Stormont’s health minister has asked his cross-border counterpart to consider new laws and data-sharing agreements to help track international travellers arriving on the island. Robin Swann has written to Stephen Donnelly expressing concern about the &ldquo;inability&rdquo; of both jurisdictions to capture and share information about passengers transiting through one part of the island to the other.In the letter, a leaked copy of which has been seen by the PA news agency, Mr Swann told Mr Donnelly that his officials were facing &ldquo;serious impediments&rdquo; in monitoring travellers who cross the border having landed in the Irish Republic from an at-risk country. Such passengers are required to self-isolate in Northern Ireland for 14 days.Mr Swann said the system was reliant on people filling in a passenger locator form within 48 hours of entering Northern Ireland.He said if they failed to fill in those forms, the authorities north of the border had no way of tracing them.&ldquo;The logical solution is to ensure that all international travellers landing on the island of Ireland provide data which is accessible for compliance checks in our respective jurisdictions,&rdquo; Mr Swann wrote.&ldquo;I would welcome the opportunity to engage with you on this with a view to finding a rapid resolution, including the introduction of new legislation and data-sharing agreements as required.&ldquo;I believe this would be a significant achievement which would demonstrate our commitment to working together to effectively address common challenges.&rdquo; On Thursday, executive ministers in Belfast agreed to write to the UK and Irish governments requesting that a meeting of the British Irish Council is convened to discussing travel issues presented by Covid-19.The council includes the two governments and representatives from all the devolved regions in the UK.Ministers on both sides of the Irish border are already due to meet to discuss issues of mutual interest at a North South Ministerial Council meeting in Dublin next Friday.There are some significant differences in policy adopted on both sides of the border.The Irish Republic&rsquo;s green list of countries deemed safe for travel only extends to 15 nations while a similar list issued by Stormont includes almost 60 destinations.

In the limited series documentary, we get introduced to Gloria after federal agents have bugged the house of Paul Castellano. And, it's only because when they were reviewing the tapes, they realized that they're not only listing to a dramatic soap opera set in the world of mobsters, but also to a torrid affair between the big man and his maid in his massive mansion. The boss was 65 when the young Medellin-born Gloria began working as a housekeeper for the Castellano family in their 17-bedroom 12-bathroom estate in New York.

To fill the gap, officials said they plan to step up admissions to medical schools using a combination of new quotas, incentives for students in less lucrative specialities and those who complete a decade of public health work in rural areas.
 "We will increase the quota for medical students to add more personnel in specialised fields," Kim Tae-nyeon, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, said at a policy meeting on Thursday.
 The plan is to boost medical school admissions by about 400 a year for the next decade, before returning to a quota of 3,058, which has stayed fixed since 2006.
 The government said it would waive tuition and offer full scholarships to about 300 students in areas such as epidemiology, gynaecology or surgery, widely seen as unpopular in contrast with more lucrative plastic surgery and dermatology.

Happy Friday! The summer weather we have seen all week continues out there again this afternoon.[CLICK HERE TO WATCH LIVE NEWSCASTS]Another warm and muggy morning out there to start your Friday with areas of isolated fog as well. Temperatures are into the mid 70s this morning and we are expecting to climb back into the low to mid 90s. Just like every other day out there this week, we will see isolated storms develop by midday becoming wider spread through the middle of the afternoon. These storms will have the potential to be strong, bringing periods of torrential rainfall which may lead to local flooding. Strong gusts of wind, small hail, and frequent lightning/thunder will also be possible with these storms as well. Where we don’t see storms there will once again be heat index values near 100-degrees.Each day this weekend will bring the threat of isolated showers and storms, which will also bring the threat of some heavy downpours and gusty winds. Temperatures through the weekend will level out into the low to mid 90s with feels like temperatures between 98 to 104 degrees. The heat and humidity will continue as we move into next week with temperatures staying into the low 90s, maybe even a few spots with the upper 80s. We will have to watch the tropics which are becoming more active. Hanna developed into a Tropical Storm last night and Tropical Storm Gonzalo is churning through the Atlantic and pushing towards the Caribbean. We will continue to watch this and let you know how it may impact us here in the Valley as the system continues westward!Copyright 2020 WAFF. All rights reserved.

All was going reasonably ok in so far as there had been minimal arguments over leg-yielding past a particularly deadly looking floral foe and a small passage past a unpleasant pheasant and mother was at least holding up 70% of my head weight when the faintest of rumbles could be heard behind us. Mother turned in the saddle and twitched more violently than Jimmy Carr’s tax accountant hearing adverts for Haven, as she tried not to let on we had a two tonne tractor of terror bearing down on my ass like an unwanted relative at Christmas. Bob’s mother restored my faith that some humans do actually possess a brain by suggesting we should “trot on” toward the gap in the hedge that loomed like a shining beacon of hope some distance down the road, and indeed for about six strides we made like sheep and got the flock out of there.

The larger deficit has been a result of shortfalls in tax revenues — on the back of shortfalls in international trade taxes, taxes on goods and services and taxes on income and property in response to unfavourable external and domestic conditions — and higher pace of spending, which included some unbudgeted COVID-19 related expenditure.
