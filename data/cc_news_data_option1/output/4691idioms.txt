The letter also announced that William Dean, an attorney for three of the alleged victims, was arrested on Monday for extortion related to soliciting a cash payout on behalf of the three accusers in exchange for altered testimony.
 The new testimonies from the three alleged victims, provided in sworn affidavits that were identical in content, recanted their previous sworn statements, and "asserted that they did not get an accurate look at the events as they occurred, that Deandre Baker was present but not involved in any criminal act and that they were not robbed or assaulted," according to the letter.
 "We feel as if justice has FINALLY been served for DeAndre," said Baker's attorney Patrick G. Patel in a written statement. "All along I have been guaranteeing a dismissal and said unequivocally that this was an extortion case. We thank the Broward County (Prosecutor's) office for doing what co counsel, Brad Cohen and I have been demanding from day one!"
 CNN has been unable to reach William Dean, whom the Broward Sheriff's Office says remains in jail at this time. It is unclear if Dean has legal representation.

Rather famously, the entirety of _Russian Ark_ takes place in a single, uninterrupted shot. Indeed, it takes as long to watch the film as it did to shoot it. Unfortunately, the audacity of this approach tends to overshadow _Russian Ark_ 's artistic merits. And look, I get it. Russsian history isn't everybody's thing. Slow burns with no cuts aren't everybody's thing. But I think it is bad form to celebrate the film's technical achievement in isolation of its artistry.

During my internship, I learned first-hand the difference between being on and off the record. I received a call from a Florida-based newspaper who was looking for our organization’s statement on a controversial topic dealing with a high-profile celebrity. I went ahead and the pre-drafted statement, and, in response to follow-up questions, added some additional commentary. Hours later, my fellow interns and I saw my name listed as the official spokesperson for the organization in an article — which was quickly picked up by other news outlets. Luckily, the added commentary was appropriate and aligned with our pre-approved messaging. With my boss out of the office that day, I was praised for thinking quickly on my feet even though I was just an intern — not the official spokesperson for a leading nonprofit!

Barack Obama has said that he had ruled out involving Pakistan in the raid on Osama bin Laden's hideout because it was an "open secret" that certain elements inside Pakistan's military, and especially its intelligence services, maintained links to the Taliban and perhaps even al-Qaeda, sometimes using them as strategic assets against Afghanistan and India.
 Giving a blow-by-blow account of the Abbottabad raid by American commandos that killed the world's most wanted terrorist on May 2, 2011 in his latest book "A Promised Land", the former US president said that the top secret operation was opposed by the then defence secretary Robert Gates and his former vice president Joe Biden, who is now the President-elect.
 In the book that hit the stands globally on Tuesday, America's first Black president described the various options of killing bin Laden once it became increasingly clear that the elusive al Qaeda chief was living in a safe hideout on the outskirts of a Pakistani military cantonment in Abbottabad.
 "Based on what I'd heard, I decided we had enough information to begin developing options for an attack on the compound. While the CIA team continued to work on identifying the Pacer, I asked Tom Donilon and John Brennan to explore what a raid would look like," Obama writes in his memoir.
 The need for secrecy added to the challenge; if even the slightest hint of our lead on bin Laden leaked, we knew our opportunity would be lost. As a result, only a handful of people across the entire federal government were read into the planning phase of the operation, he said.
 "We had one other constraint: Whatever option we chose could not involve the Pakistanis," he wrote.
 "Although Pakistan's government cooperated with us on a host of counterterrorism operations and provided a vital supply path for our forces in Afghanistan, it was an open secret that certain elements inside the country's military, and especially its intelligence services, maintained links to the Taliban and perhaps even al-Qaeda, sometimes using them as strategic assets to ensure that the Afghan government remained weak and unable to align itself with Pakistan's number one rival, India," Obama revealed.
 "The fact that the Abbottabad compound was just a few miles from the Pakistan military's equivalent of West Point only heightened the possibility that anything we told the Pakistanis could end up tipping off our target. "Whatever we chose to do in Abbottabad, then, would involve violating the territory of a putative ally in the most egregious way possible, short of war-- raising both the diplomatic stakes and the operational complexities," he wrote.
 In the final stages they were discussing two options. The first was to demolish it with an air strike. The second option was to authorise a special ops mission, in which a select team would covertly fly into Pakistan via helicopter, raid the compound, and get out before the Pakistani police or military had time to react. Despite all the risks involved, Obama and his national security team opted for the second option, but not before multiple rounds of discussions and intensive planning.
 The day before he gave the final approval for the raid, at a Situation Room meeting, Hillary Clinton, the then Secretary of State, said that it was a 51-49 call. "Gates recommended against a raid, although he was open to considering the strike option," he said.
 "Joe (Biden) also weighed in against the raid, arguing that given the enormous consequences of failure, I should defer any decision until the intelligence community was more certain that bin Laden was in the compound. "As had been true in every major decision I'd made as president, I appreciated Joe's willingness to buck the prevailing mood and ask tough questions, often in the interest of giving me the space I needed for my own internal deliberations," Obama wrote.
 After the successful Abbottabad raid, Obama made a number of calls domestically and internationally, the toughest of which he expected to be that with the then Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, he wrote.
 "I expected my most difficult call to be with Pakistan's beleaguered president, Asif Ali Zardari, who would surely face a backlash at home over our violation of Pakistani sovereignty. When I reached him, however, he expressed congratulations and support. 'Whatever the fallout,' he said, 'it's very good news." He showed genuine emotion, recalling how his wife, Benazir Bhutto, had been killed by extremists with reported ties to al-Qaeda," Obama wrote.
 "Mike Mullen had put a call in to Pakistan's army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and while the conversation had been polite, Kayani had requested that we come clean on the raid and its target as quickly as possible in order to help his people manage the reaction of the Pakistani public," he said. Laden, the world's most wanted terrorist, was the chief of al-Qaeda that carried out the 9/11 attacks on twin towers in New York, killing nearly 3,000 people. He was killed in a covert raid by a US Navy SEAL team at his Abbottabad compound in Pakistan.

HIBBING — The Hibbing High School football and volleyball teams were cruising right along with their seasons, but there was a lingering thought in the background — would they be able to finish their seasons.
 When the cases of COVID-19 started going up would that put a damper on their plans?
 When the Hibbing School Board met in an emergency meeting last Thursday, those seasons were going to be put on hold.
 The board decided to go to distance learning, which, ultimately, ended the fall season for both football and volleyball.
 That decision didn’t exactly come as a surprise for either football coach Shaun Howard and volleyball coach Lauren Peterson.
 “I kind of thought it would happen, but I was hoping for the last week of November, after Thanksgiving,” Peterson said. “I expected it at some point, so I took it in stride.”
 Howard had to break it to his players the day of the Bluejackets last game of the regular season against Grand Rapids, at 3:30 p.m., in the locker room at Cheever Field, just before they left for the game.
 “I wanted to make sure that they found out from us,” Howard said. “I don’t know what else we could have done differently. That feeling was always in the back of our minds, but it was hard telling the kids. They sunk their heads. We weren’t totally prepared to do that.
 “It was a little hard, and it was a little emotional for me. The seniors and juniors were in shock, and not ready for it. The seniors were looking forward to our playoff game, and having a chance to win that playoff game.”
 Peterson also informed her players but most of them knew about it before their game with Esko Thursday.
 “They found out before I had the chance to tell them,” Peterson said. “I told them on the bus, and I asked if they had any questions for me. I told them it would be a two-week restart.
 “Our seniors told the team to play like it was their last game. They were emotional, but depending on how this goes, we might be able to do sections. If all goes well, we could come back if the community does their part. We’ll take day-by-day.”
 For football, the season is over. Hibbing was scheduled to play Duluth Denfeld today at Public Schools Stadium.
 Howard would have liked one last chance to put this team on the field.
 “For me, you’re used to having a playoff game,” Howard said. “It either gives you a chance to move on, or your season is done. The way it ended, it’s a weird feeling. I stood on the field in Rapids wishing we could do something different to move on. We’re done.”
 The season didn’t end the way Howard wanted it to, but he did say that there was some progress made this season.
 “Everyone will look at the record, but our senior leadership was huge,” Howard said. “They stepped up and kept us going when we lost kids to COVID and quarantine. They stepped up more than I thought they would.
 “We have things to build on. We started two freshmen in the offensive line against Grand Rapids. We have a lot of young players that if we have a normal offseason, we could potentially have a much-better year next year, record- wise.”
 For volleyball, if there is a two-week restart, the Bluejackets would return in time for the first round of playoffs. Right now, Hibbing will miss four regular-season games.
 “Dec. 1 would be our first section game,” Peterson said. “Some teams are still playing, so I’m hopeful. At the same time, I don’t know. I want them to play. It’s for the kids. If you take it from that perspective, we wanted to give them a normal year of school.
 “That’s what we want, but that has to come from all of us. They took it hard. I’m trying to stay positive for them.”
 If the Hibbing volleyball team isn’t able to finish out the season, Peterson said there were positive changes as well.
 “I enjoyed my first year,” Peterson said. “I changed what I decided to do, and I’ll keep that approach, like drilling the fundamentals and getting the program to expand. I have to get back to the younger girls, getting them to start earlier.”

He also said that the Jammu and Kashmir will always be an integral part of India."Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy 'global gathbandhan' against our national interest. Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it," Shah said in one of the tweets.

Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it.&mdash; Amit Shah (@AmitShah) November 17, 2020 The home minister said PAGD was trying to go global and seek intervention in Jammu and Kashmir from foreign forces. "The Gupkar Gang is going global! They want foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir," Shah said. He also dragged Congress in his attack as he questioned what the grand old party's stand was. "The Gupkar Gang also insults India's Tricolour. Do Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji support such moves of the Gupkar Gang ? They should make their stand crystal clear to the people of India," Shah asked. Congress, after attending Gupkar alliance meeting a few days ago, had announced that it supports the alliance and will fight the BJP on all fronts in the upcoming council polls in Jammu and Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy 'global gathbandhan' against our national interest.

"Congress and the Gupkar Gang want to take J&K back to the era of terror and turmoil. They want to take away rights of Dalits, women and tribals that we have ensured by removing Article 370. This is why they're being rejected by the people everywhere," Shah wrote on Twitter.

Dia has admitted that Brighton and Hove Albion made a bid in the summer, though his stock appears to have risen sharply following a remarkable opening to the Ligue 1 campaign.
 “There were discussions but it didn’t go any further. I’d like to experience England and the Premier League – all players dream of playing in the Premier League one day, and I’m one of those players,”  _he said_ .
 “But there’s no point making the move just for the experience of it. You need to move when you’re ready, when you’ve proven yourself when you show consistency. You need to take your time and not move to England too quickly, otherwise, you’ll quickly get lost."
 Dia is clearly ambitious, then, and his attitude suggests he won’t get carried away with his current goalscoring spell. But his recent displays have been eye-catching. He scored twice in Reims’ 4-4 draw with Lens before the international break. And he hit a hat-trick in a 4-0 win away at Montpellier late last month.

1. Marketing — both email and social media. When I started Hocsocx, I was absolutely not a social media person (still am not the biggest!). However, my first employee was in charge of posting on our social media, which is where we found a HUGE portion of our target customers. Having social media, specifically Instagram and Facebook — as well as email campaigns, have been huge factors to keeping our customers intrigued and up to date on what’s happening with our brand. Prior to hiring my first employee, my social media marketing was very erratic. Once I had someone doing daily posts across social media, we had measurable increases in sales. Then we added social media advertising and promoting posts which increased our sales even further. We’re also able to track this through our analytics.   2. Inventory Management– as we continued growing and developing throughout the years, it became crucial to have a solid supply of inventory. I believe when first starting out, you shouldn’t have an overflow of inventory, but rather have the ability to produce more product when you need it and buy in small bulks until your business starts making bigger, more consistent strides.   3. Be prepared for ups & downs — as an eCommerce business, you have to remember you’re literally serving people that are ordering from you online! There are many different reasons why individuals may not be shopping, but being prepared to have slow times is definitely crucial. For example, for 10 out of 12 months of the year our business is crazy business, and then right around March and April we have a slow patch. This is typically a time where the sports we cater to are getting ready to get back into spring training, or just wrapped up their season. This is when we start transitioning to the summer months where we usually see sales start to rebound after that slump.   4. Your ability to communicate timely and consistently with your customers will equate to their overall customer satisfaction — this is a HUGE factor in the success behind eCommerce. Nothing is more frustrating than shopping online, having a question or concern and not hearing back from the company for a week or never! Understanding the balance of where people are coming from with shopping online and not having the easy access of talking to someone face to face is definitely something eCommerce businesses need to understand. We’ve had many positive reviews that mentioned how quickly they received a response from us.   5. Creating a solid customer base (repeat customers, etc.) — within eCommerce, as well as a strong following on social media and other online platforms is definitely important. Having the support from individuals who have not only purchased from you once or twice, but multiple times throughout the year not only helps with sales, but also with word-of-mouth marketing which brings referral traffic to your site/product. When Hocsocx first started, I luckily had my daughters to help encourage their teammates to try out our socks. As more of the team tried Hocsocx, our sales continued to grow thanks to their positive word-of-mouth endorsements of the product.

Throughout my career, I have harkened back to this sentiment often. Work hard for what you believe in, even when no one appreciates it. They will eventually. Leaders often must perform the hard work of digging the trenches of new ideas, processes or paths so that others may follow. In the end, if your desire is to leave this world a better place, then you dig, not with resentment of the extra work, but with great exhilaration and pride, for you alone can later stand on the bank and revel in the water that flows behind.

Pfeiffenberger, Martin GUILDERLAND Martin E. Pfeiffenberger, 58 of Guilderland, passed away unexpectedly on Friday, November 13, 2020, at Albany Medical Center. Born in Niskayuna, he was the son of the late Robert H. and Phyllis M. Pfeiffenberger. Raised in Colonie, Marty was a graduate of Bishop Gibbons High School and the University of Albany. Marty started his career as a sales representative at Georgia Pacific in Scotia and was also a long-time waiter at the Barnsider restaurant in Colonie. In 2003, Marty founded Maple Tree Funding in Latham. Through his hard work and dedication, he grew Maple Tree Funding into the successful business that it is today. Marty served as secretary of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB), and currently held the position of president of the Board of Directors of ClearPath Association Management Solutions and had recently served as the chair of NAMB's Government Affairs Committee. He also served as president of the N.Y. Association of Mortgage Brokers in 2014-2015. Marty's commitment and passion for the association was recently recognized when he was presented with the 2019-2020 Mortgage Professional of the Year Award, one of the association's most prestigious awards. Marty was an avid sports fan, horse racing and golf enthusiast. He loved the N.Y. Giants and the N.Y. Rangers and attended many games with his best friends. He was a member of Albany Country Club and thoroughly enjoyed Saturday morning pick-up matches with his golfing buddies.

Marty was a true gentleman, genuine to the core. He loved life and lived it to the fullest. He was adored by his family and his too many to count friends. He was our confidant, companion and caretaker. Marty had an easy way about him and an amazing sense of humor and wit, lighting up every room he entered with his presence and leaving smiles upon his exit. His vast knowledge on countless subjects earned him the family nicknames such as "Mr. Google" or "Walking Encyclopedia." His positivity and larger than life personality will be missed by so many. In keeping with his charitable and giving nature, Marty gave the gift of life by being an organ donor. In 2006 he met and married the love of his life Kim, and she gave him the greatest gift he would ever receive, their son Chase. They changed his life, and as with all things Marty tried - he easily and quickly excelled at being an amazing father, patient, kind and ever present. He enjoyed coaching and volunteering with Guilderland youth sports. His greatest joy was to share his time coaching, playing sports and guiding his amazing son Chase. Marty was the beloved husband of Kimberly Pfeiffenberger. He was the devoted father of Chase Pfeiffenberger; stepfather of Kayla and Alexa Patnaude; and was the son- in-law of Charlene Bowers. Marty was the brother of Robert (Karen) Pfeiffenberger, Philip (Judy) Pfeiffenberger, Gregory (Jill) Pfeiffenberger, Catherine Pfeiffenberger (Matthew Clements) and Michelle Pfeiffenberger (Mark Cuthbertson). He is also survived by several nieces, nephews, great-nieces and nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins.

A move to the Premier League would represent something of a meteoric rise for Dia, who has faced various challenges and setbacks on his road to the top of the French game.
 Aged 12, he was invited to a trial at Saint-Etienne, but his dad’s car broke down on the way to the training ground. There were no second chances, so Dia moved on. He was given an opportunity to impress with Lyon, only to be told that he wasn’t expected to grow much taller, and released as a result.
 A few years on, DIa found himself at a much more modest club: Jura-Sud. “I still wanted to become a footballer but it wasn’t my priority,” he said. “First I had to work and earn a living for me, for my family [Boulaye is the sixth of seven siblings].
 "But football was always at the back of my mind, and my plan was to work for a year or two and then to really go for it, apply for trials at the CFA (4th division) level and hopefully use that as a springboard to get to the professional level.”
 After scoring 15 goals in 21 appearances for Jura-Sud, Dia was snapped up by Reims in 2018, quickly forcing his way into the first-team set-up and establishing a reputation as one of the brightest young talents at the club.

The GOP majority on the Judiciary panel threatened Zuckerberg and Dorsey with subpoenas last month if they didn't agree to voluntarily testify for Tuesday's hearing. Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee lambasted the two CEOs and Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, at a hearing last month for what they said was a pattern of silencing conservative viewpoints while giving free rein to political actors from countries like China and Iran.
 Despite fears over security in the run-up to Nov. 3 and social media companies bracing for the worst, the election turned out to be the most secure in U.S. history, federal and state officials from both parties say -- repudiating Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud.
 Facebook insists it has learned its lesson from the 2016 election and is no longer a conduit for misinformation, voter suppression and election disruption. This fall Facebook said it removed a small network of accounts and pages linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency, the "troll factory" that has used social media accounts to sow political discord in the U.S. since the 2016 election. Twitter suspended five related accounts.
 But critical outsiders, as well as some of Facebook's own employees, say the company's efforts to tighten its safeguards remain insufficient, despite it having spent billions.
 "Facebook only acts if they feel there's a threat to their reputation or their bottom line," says Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. The organization had pressed Facebook to take down the "Stop the Steal" group.
 There's no evidence that the social media giants are biased against conservative news, posts or other material, or that they favor one side of political debate over another, researchers have found. But criticism of the companies' policies, and their handling of disinformation tied to the election, has come from Democrats as well as Republicans.
 Democrats have focused their criticism mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence, keep people from voting or spread falsehoods about the coronavirus. They criticize the tech CEOs for failing to police content, blaming the platforms for playing a role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S. And that criticism has extended to their efforts to stamp out false information related to the election.

I always confess to people I network with that I’m bad at networking — that seems to break the ice. I also like to wear a conversation-starter. When I went to a trade show, I wore sequin houndstooth loafers. Everyone stopped me to talk about them. Now that we’re all on Zoom, I try to do the same thing with shirts. Finally, I always ask to connect with the person afterward on email, LinkedIn, and Twitter. That way they are not a mere acquaintance, but someone who is connected to me.

"Now if I did it again, I would glue all the raffia down to the wreath and then simply glue the mirror down on top.
 "It was taking shape but where I glued it down it looked a mess, so I bought some natural beads from ebay and attached them around with hot glue to mask the edges of the raffia around the mirror.
 "I hung it on a door and cut the raffia into the circle shape it is. It’s so effective and cost me £16 to make, which is a lot thriftier than buying a raffia mirror for £100!
