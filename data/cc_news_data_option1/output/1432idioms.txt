If the team behind this series had wanted a different title for it, Language, Language, Language would have fit the bill, as it’s more and more apparent that those who can speak the local lingo have an advantage. Dom speaks enough Spanish to get by. Rob, meanwhile, is trying to find out if he and Jen can afford a bus trip. “Cincuenta dollars”, say a couple of guys, holding up five fingers. “Five dollars, right,” says Rob. (It’s actually 50.) But what’s also apparent is that the teams are by now making the most of this once-in-a- lifetime trip. “We’re just learning how to have a good time,” says Jen, as she and Rob visit a beer festival at Blumenau. And Jo muses, “I didn’t expect the race to be so enlightening.” ★★★★ JP

This is the best Transformers movie by a long shot. It’s an origin story of how the title’s good robot came to Earth back in 1987 (cue a great soundtrack led by The Smiths), transformed into a battered yellow VW Beetle and is adopted by 18-year-old Hailee Steinfeld. Director Travis Knight (who made the excellent stop-frame animated film Kubo and the Two Strings) uncomplicates things, delivering less wizz-bang pyrotechnics in favour of a bit of heart. ★★★★ NP
