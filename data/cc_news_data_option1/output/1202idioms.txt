Charles E. Guptill 1945 - 2020 BRUNSWICK - Charles E. Guptill, of Brunswick, passed away on Monday March 16, 2020 at Mid-Coast Hospital with his beloved wife, Michelle, by his side. Charlie was born in 1945 in Brunswick to parents, Roy and Charlotte Guptill. He attended local schools and played varsity hockey and tennis for Brunswick High School. After graduating from College in Nebraska, Charlie returned to Maine and worked for a time as an arborist for a tree company. While his future wife, Michelle was studying Art History and Architecture in Boston, her friend, Joni came to stay with her for the weekend. She asked Michelle if she would be willing to go on a "blind date" with a guy named Charlie from Brunswick. They would be double dating with Joni and her boyfriend at the time. The fact that Charlie was 5 ½ years older than Michelle intrigued her and she agreed. Michelle still remembers the first time she saw Charlie. He was tan from working outdoors, he wore jeans, a button- down collar shirt, a navy-blue sport jacket with gold buttons, loafers worn without socks and Ray Ban sunglasses. She also noticed he had dimples. They went out that evening and also the next day. After that first date Charlie would often call Michelle and when he would be done with work, he would drive to Boston two to three times a week if just to spend one or two hours with her and then drive back to Maine that same evening. The two of them soon became inseparable and eventually married and settled in Brunswick where they raised their three children. Growing up, Charlie learned to love and respect nature and the outdoors from his father, Roy. They were very close and often went fishing, bird hunting, hiking, duck hunting, boating, skiing and snowshoeing together. His father was a wonderful role model for Charlie. Charlie was very athletic and the whole family spent many happy times at their camp in Kingfield, only minutes away from Sugarloaf Mountain, where they skied most of the winter. Charlie and his family also loved boating. Their boat, the JES-SEA was named after their oldest daughter, Jessica. With their boat they enjoyed cruising Casco Bay, having picnics on Eagle Island, trips to Boothbay, Portland, Chebeague Island and Sebago Lake. On the Fourth of July they would often go by boat and anchor just off of Portland and watch the fireworks. There was always some sort of adventure taking place. Charlie worked for many years as an oil broker and territory manager for various distributors in Maine and Massachusetts. He always took very good care of his customers and formed many lasting friendships throughout the years. One of the many memories that Charlie leaves is the wonderful times he spent with his son, Ryan, son-in-law, Shaun and his two oldest grandsons, Andrew and Sam, taking them to Bradford Camps in the deep North Woods of Maine. For many summers they would spend a week there, fly fishing, hiking and just spending quality time together without the interruption of cell phones, computers, TV, radios or newspapers. Stunningly beautiful and pristine, Bradford Camps was 50 miles from the nearest town and accessible only by float plane or having to ride many miles on logging roads. They all looked forward to these special times together. Charlie is survived by his wife, Michelle, the love of his life for 50 years; his son, Ryan C. Guptill of Brunswick; daughter, Jessica Ralston and her husband Shaun of Bow, N.H., grandsons, Andrew and Samuel Ralston of Bow, N.H.; daughter Kathryn Daub and her husband Jordan of Summit, N.J., grandson, James Daub of Summit, N.J. and another grandson expected in early July. Charlie was very proud of his family and they all brought him great joy. Charlie was predeceased by two of his three liver and white English Springer Spaniel girls, Elizabeth Barrett Brown Puppy and Nora. He is survived by his current liver and white English Springer Spaniel, Fiona. He loved all of them very much. As per Charlie's wishes there will be no funeral. A private family celebration of his life will be held this summer. Arrangements are by the Kincer Funeral Home/Funeral Alternatives. Our family would like to thank them for their very kind, compassionate and caring attention to detail. Life is But a Dream by Lewis Carroll. A boat beneath a sunny sky, Lingering onward dreamily In an evening in July Children three that nestle near, Eager eye and willing ear, Pleased a simple tale to hear Long has paled that sunny sky Echoes fade and memories die Autumn frosts have slain July Still he haunts me, phantomwise, Moving under cloudy skies Never seen by waking eyes Children yet the tale to hear Eager eye and willing ear, Lovingly shall nestle near, In a Wonderland they lie, Dreaming as the days go by Dreaming as the summers die, Ever drifting down the stream, Lingering in a golden gleam, Life, what is it but a dream?

It's incredibly apparent that COVID-19 has changed life as we know it far beyond just social distancing.
   
 Step in a grocery store at the moment and you'll see there's a tremendous increase in demand for food products. Stores can barely keep some items on the shelves.
   
 Panic buying, stocking up, hunkering down -- regardless of what label you give it, this isn't the kind of rush preparedness purchasing we see when a blizzard is impending. Sure, you can't find eggs, milk or bread, but many other things aren't staying long on the shelves either.
   
 People are buying out grocery stores in large swaths to stock up on the realization that they'll be stuck in their homes for the foreseeable future.
   
 We're not here to judge what consumers purchase. If you need it, by all means, buy it, but please don't waste it. Additionally, we feel the obligation to remind our readers that hoarding food and resources is unconscionable.
   
 Instead, we're choosing to highlight what might be one of seldom silver linings brought on by COVID-19. Demand for Kansas dairy and meat products has never been higher. Thank you to our Kansas producers for stepping up in these uncertain times to meet the demand.
   
 The Hutchinson News reported last week that many Kansas ag companies are seeing spikes in demand, especially dairies and meat processors.
   
 "It's been insane," Cassey Shupe, one of the owners of Holton Meat Processing in Holton, told Alice Mannette. "We're working around the clock."
   
 The biggest issue Shupe's plant is facing is the labor needed to keep up. They have animals. Similar situations are echoed at Hildebrand Farms Dairy in Junction City and Cargill in Dodge City. There are many other producers across the state who are likely experiencing high demand for their products.
   
 We hope you keep your spirits high. Right now you're certainly living up to that reputation of a Kansas work ethic.
   
 We fully understand that there's pressure to keep shelves stocked and that social distancing may complicate that process, but we certainly applaud the efforts of our Kansas producers to put food on the table.
   
 What you're doing is critical for the rest of us to get through the coming weeks and months.
   
 These are the kinds of stories people will tell decades from now. This is the kind of history we want to remember for Kansas when COVID-19 gets brought up.

26일(현지시간) 찰스(71) 왕세자의 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19) 검사 특혜 의혹을 부인했다.      에드워드 아가르 영국 보건부 부장관은 이날 스카이 뉴스 프로그램과의 인터뷰에서 "찰스 왕세자는 새치기하지 않았다(did not jump the queue)"라고 말했다.      그는 "내가 이해하기로는 찰스 왕세자의 증상과 상태는 (코로나19 검사를 받기 위한) 기준을 충족했다"고 강조했다.      왕실 업무를 담당하는 클래런스 하우스는 전날 찰스 왕세자가 코로나19 확진 판정을 받았지만 가벼운 증상 외에는 좋은 건강 상태를 유지하고 있다고 밝혔다.      지난 주말 스코틀랜드로 건너간 찰스 왕세자 부부는 23일 국민보건서비스(NHS)를 통해 코로나19 테스트를 받았고, 24일 저녁 찰스 왕세자만 양성으로 판정됐다.      영국에서는 현재 기침과 열 등 코로나19 의심 증상이 있더라도 곧바로 검사를 받지는 못한다.      일단은 자택에서 자가격리 조치를 취해야 한다.      대신 호흡곤란 등 심각한 증상으로 인해 병원에 입원하는 환자들을 대상으로 우선으로 검사를 실시하고 있다.      심지어 의사와 간호사 등 NHS 직원들도 코로나19 검사를 받지 못하고 있다.      이에 따라 일각에서는 가벼운 증상만 보인 찰스 왕세자가 코로나19 검사를 받은 것은 왕실 구성원에 대한 특혜 아니냐는 의혹을 제기하고 있다.      아가 부장관은 "우리는 이미 9만7천건의 코로나19 검사를 실시했으며, 앞으로 더 많은 검사를 하기 위해 노력하고 있다"면서 "NHS 직원과 사회복지 인력 등이 (검사를 받기 위한) 줄의 맨 앞에 있다"고 강조했다.      그는 영국이 코로나19 치료에 필수적인 산소호흡기를 8천대 확보했으며, 추가로 8천대가 1∼2주 이내 도착할 것이라고 밝혔다.      아울러 여러 제조업체에 산소호흡기를 추가 제작해 NHS에 공급해줄 것을 긴급히 요청했다고 말했다.      이와 관련해 청소기 등 가전제조업체인 다이슨은 정부가 산소호흡기 1만대를 주문했다고 전했다.

At home, as at the beach, the best possible outfit involves covering way more of your body than you initially imagined. Hitting the beach in style is about more than picking the shoes least likely to get sand stuck in them and calling it a day. Yes, you should definitely be investing in a solid pair of water- resistant shorts (they don't even have to be swim trunks!) but that doesn't mean they're the only thing you should be bringing. In fact, the beach is the perfect place to bust out the summer wardrobe heavy hitters: the polo shirt with a bit too much personality to wear to work, the linen pants you love but are too self-conscious to rock regularly, the espadrilles that feel too, well, _beach-y_ , to wear anywhere else.

“It sucks,” the Illinois coach continued. “It’s awful. It’s tough, especially because it’s something that’s out of (the athletes’) control. But it had to be done. The vast majority of these Olympians weren’t able to train in the way they need to to be ready for the Olympics. The entire world has been put on notice and put on lockdown.”
 Spring’s Illini team also saw its season end abruptly with a month-plus still to go when the NCAA and Big Ten canceled all winter and spring sports competitions on March 12. Illinois was in Puerto Rico at the time for an invitational meet.
 The postponement of the Olympics is unprecedented, at least in modern history. The Olympics, which were set to draw close to 11,000 athletes from 200-plus countries to the island nation of Japan this summer, had only been canceled previously during periods of war, but never suspended.
 Spring gave credit to national delegations for placing pressure on the IOC. Australia and Canada both indicated before Tuesday’s announcement they would not send athletes to Tokyo had the Summer Games been played as scheduled. USA swimming and USA track and field — whose athletes make up one-third of the entire U.S. team — also pushed for a postponement.
 “What a power move by Canada to say we’re not sending people to Tokyo,” Spring said. “What a leadership move by Canada, a major delegation from North America. That was a big left hook to the IOC. Not that that makes all the difference (in the final decision), but it (was) still a big blow to the IOC.”
 In late March, Spring said, many Olympic athletes are “in the red zone” of their preparations. With several countries putting their citizens on lockdown in an effort at social distancing to offset the spread of the novel coronavirus, many athletes were forced to change how they had been training for the upcoming summer games.
 In the case of the U.S. gymnastics teams, the athletes would have been gearing up for the Olympic Team Trials from June 25-28 at the Enterprise Center in St. Louis. Now, those preparations are completely on hold.
 “You can’t train with anyone, bolts on doors (at training facilities), locked down,” Spring said of the situation facing Olympic athletes before the 2020 Games were postponed. “You have lost weeks (of training). You see on Facebook these guys are looking for training facilities, for God sakes. You can only do so much at home. (Normal training) was taken off the table for many people.”

Since then, efforts on the part of our faculty and staff have allowed coursework to be moved to distance education technologies that enable learning to continue at the world-class level. Strict travel and social-distancing protocols have been put in place to enable continued operation of cutting-edge research across our many disciplines.

Everyone “must all act as if we have it” to avoid spreading it further, he said.
 Still, Wolf has resisted offering any sort of projection for when he thinks the state could start getting back to normal.
 “We’re going to recover from this crisis, but first we must get through it,” Wolf said.
 Wolf’s stay-at-home order requires residents to avoid leaving home, except for certain allowable errands for health or safety purposes or going to a job designated in life-sustaining employment sector.
 Also Wednesday, the state Department of Health said it had confirmed 276 more cases of coronavirus — an increase of one-third — and four more deaths for a total of 11 statewide.
 Meanwhile, the state House of Representatives and Senate, with many members voting remotely under new chamber rules, passed legislation to delay the primary election by five weeks to June 2, a bill that Wolf said he will sign.
 They also passed other elements of a package of coronavirus-related legislation, including marshaling $50 million in aid to help hospitals, nursing homes and emergency response teams afford masks, gloves and other personal protective gear. The bill gives Wolf the authority to transfer money from other funds.
 A look at other coronavirus-related developments in Pennsylvania:
 Cases
 With the cases confirmed by the state Department of Health, there are now more than 1,120 cases in 44 counties.
 New deaths were reported in Luzerne, Philadelphia and Delaware counties.
 Delaware County said one victim was an 85-year-old man and the other was an 86-year-old woman. Both had been hospitalized.
 Health Secretary Rachel Levine said the administration expects a surge of patients in the coming weeks.
 Cases are doubling every two to three days, and the administration is putting a heavy emphasis on buying time to help get the state’s health care system ready for that growing flood of patients, Levine said.
 Jobless claims
 More than 400,000 Pennsylvanians filed for unemployment compensation benefits last week amid a tidal wave of coronavirus-related business shutdowns, eclipsing the high-point during the recession a decade ago, the state’s top organized labor leader said Wednesday.
 Rick Bloomingdale, president of the Pennsylvania chapter of the AFL-CIO, said Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration briefed him on last week’s figures as the union urges Wolf and lawmakers to expand unemployment compensation benefits to replace a full salary, rather than a half salary.
 Wolf last Thursday ordered a statewide shutdown of all “non-life-sustaining” businesses in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus and buy time for the state’s health care system to expand staffing, equipment and bed space.

PRINCETON -- In the wake of the state's coronavirus-prompted closure of restaurants, Skoonerz Grill & Bar foundered.
 Takeout and delivery sales didn't justify keeping the place open. But owner Keith Brown didn't want to give up.
 So, he handed over operations to employees, who will split every penny of profits. Plus, there are unusual perks.
 "It's kind of a team-building thing," said Brown, 55. "Also, they're learning about the business and the industry."
 For 15 years, Brown has run Skoonerz, a popular hangout that boasts a menu heavy with burgers, sandwiches, appetizers and other bar grub. At the start of the COVID-19 shutdown last week, a dozen of the business's 20 employees (most of them with full-time gigs elsewhere) gave up their Skoonerz jobs temporarily. That way, eight staffers with no other employment could get more hours at Skoonerz.
 Meanwhile, the pub offered takeout and delivery. But sales were flat for four days.
 Brown addressed his crew, saying, "I'm not making any money on this. But I want to keep you working."
 So, he offered a unique opportunity.
 Brown had plenty to do, as the shutdown and empty eatery provided him a chance to work on a spate of routine maintenance. Meanwhile, his employees would run the entire operation, learning new skills and assuming higher responsibilities.
 Most of them are young adults with little work experience, especially in the restaurant business. An exception is Stacie Shofner, 33, who started at age 11 in her mom's Wyanet diner.
 Last week, she worked in the kitchen. Now she is the Skoonerz manager.
 "I'm running it all right now," she said, adding with a chuckle, "or trying to."
 In addition to keeping things humming inside the joint, employees are plugging away to draw customers. Through social media, texts and word of mouth, they're urging people to call for takeout or delivery.
 "We're trying to bring in business," Shofner said.
 That's good to Skoonerz in the long run and the employees' paychecks right now. Depending on experience, some employees usually make more than minimum wage, but during the shutdown all will make minimum wage. At the end of every week, Brown will tally receipts, subtract the cost of food (but no other outlay) and divide profits among employees based on hours worked.
 Shofner doesn't expect to make as much as in pre-shutown paychecks. But she is grateful for the chance to work.
 "We're happy to be making anything," she said. "I know a lot of (bar and restaurant) people who are making nothing."
 Sunday was the first day of the employee-run experiment. Apparently, widespread promoting paid off, Brown said.
 "They had a really good day," he said.
 Mondays and Tuesdays are off days at Skoonerz. Meanwhile, Brown, Shofner and the others had high hopes that Wednesday and the rest of the week would go well.
 Even before doors opened Wednesday, they were off to a good start: A local workplace called in for 50 pickup dinners for Friday.
 Her voice rising in excitement, Shofner said, "Who knows what tomorrow will bring?"
 Skoonerz Grill & Bar, 912 N. Main St. in Princeton, is open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 8 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Deliveries are available for dinner Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The phone number is (815) 875-9464.

Staunchly anti-big cat ownership, Baskin considered herself Exotic’s natural enemy and did everything in her power to shut down his exotic animal park; she spoke out against him as often as she could and even sued him in 2011 for trademark infringement after he used her company's (Big Cat Rescue) name and logo to promote the G.W. Zoo.
 That lawsuit put Exotic a million dollars in the hole, the bankruptcy sparking a bitterness that led him to allegedly pay a hitman $10,000 to kill Baskins. The FBI got involved, and further investigation revealed that in addition to the murder-for-hire, Exotic had killed several animals at his park and had also committed fraud — he was sentenced to 22 years in prison in January.
 The developing limited series will depict all of this drama and more, hopefully delving into the shadowy secrets of Baskins’ origin story as a conservationist. There’s been no word yet on which network has picked up the project or who else has signed on to portray the colourful characters of the Tiger King’s world.

“I know the season is on hold and, to be brutally honest, I very much doubt it will be finished.
 “So, in some respects, it is probably the ideal situation and gives the new manager a longer period to build a team and to bed in. So in that aspect it is the time to come away.
 “Also I work in the food industry as a deputy manager for a company in Carlisle, which produces ready meals for M&S. So I am having to work more weekends for the foreseeable future.

 “It is understandable the club need 100 per cent commitment which I cannot give.
 “We are still working away and these are testing times for all of us.”
 He added of his career with Threave: “I have been around Threave for 15 to 16 years.

"At these private parks, we're only skating with three or four people. We're trying to keep it as minimal as possible," Elliott tells me. For the time being, he's avoiding public skate parks, as he mentions there's always nearly 50 kids skating at a time. "You touch everything, you wax spots, you try to skate a ledge and then you fall, you put your hand on the ledge, and if someone else tries to skate the exact same spot as you and falls, they put their hand on the ledge," Elliott explains. In addition to avoiding large parks, Elliott is taking a temporary break from filming, which usually requires having a crew comprised of a filmer, photographer, skater, and usually another friend.
