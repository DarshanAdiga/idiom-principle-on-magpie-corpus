At the end of the day we are forced to ask what responsibility individuals have for themselves. Set aside substances that directly alter our neurochemistry unnaturally. Make costs and trade-offs as transparent as possible. But beyond that each of us must take responsibility for ourselves. If I want to eat sugar and die an early death that is a valid position. My grandfather took such a stance towards bacon and I admired him for it. And social media is likely much less fatal than bacon.

The Eastern Samar provincial government is seeking at least PHP9.02-billion budget to finance various projects from 2021 to 2023 intended to boost the disaster resilience of the province.
 National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) regional director Meylene Rosales said on Wednesday the Regional Development Council has endorsed last month the investment portfolio for risk resilience of Eastern Samar.
 The Eastern Samar local government proposed the investment requirements disaggregated along with four landscapes � mountainous and upland steeply sloping, agricultural, coastal and near maritime areas, urban and peri-urban, Rosales said.

 Of the PHP9.02-billion fund requirement, PHP1.25 billion will be for mountain and upland steeply sloping areas, PHP2.63 billion for agricultural, PHP3.39 billion for coastal and near maritime areas, and PHP1.74 billion for urban and peri-urban.
 The risk resiliency program 2021-2023 of Eastern Samar province is a pro- people agenda and a term-based document that is responsive to the needs of constituents. It is a product of through consultations with various stakeholders in the local government, national government agencies, development partners, and civil society organizations, the Eastern Samar provincial development council said in a resolution signed by Governor Ben Evardone.
 Among the listed projects are enhance reforestation, soil and water conservation, installation of warning signages, construction of landslide barriers, livelihood, flood control, storm surge protection, compliance to land-use policies, irrigation system, the building of resilient food terminals, and construction of drainage system.
 Also proposed are mangrove rehabilitation program, seawall construction, the establishment of evacuation centers, soil erosion control, river slope protection, potable water system, water safety plan, capacity building, and establishment of the rescue center.
 These projects are up for implementation by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Public Works and Highways, Department of Agriculture, local government units, and Department of the Interior and Local Government.

The Duterte administration will respect the possible decision of Filipinos to stay in Iraq despite the looming war between the United States (US) and Iran, MalacaAang said on Wednesday.
 Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo admitted that it is impossible to impose mandatory repatriation of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Iraq, especially when the fighting between the US and Iran begins.
 Unang-una, kung meron na talagang open hostilities, repatriation is out of the question kasi shooting war na eh (First and foremost, if there are open hostilities already, repatriation is out of the question because there is already a shooting war), Panelo said in an interview with CNN Philippines.
 Now, with respect doon sa mga ayaw, paano natin pipilitin yun kung ayaw (with respect to those who do not want to be repatriated, how can we force them if they do not like it)? We cannot forcibly drag them to a ship or to whatever to bring them out, he added.
 Panelo's statement came after the Philippine Embassy in Iraq announced that President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered all Filipinos living and working in Iraq to return to the Philippines.
 There are an estimated 4,000 Filipinos in Iraq, based on the data provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).
 The President's latest order was issued after the highest threat alert was raised in Baghdad amid the escalating tensions between the US and Iraq.
 Alert Level 4, which calls for mandatory repatriation, is issued when there is a large-scale internal conflict or full-blown external account, according to the DFA's website.
 Iran's top military commander, Qassem Soleimani, was killed in a US airstrike carried out in Iraq last week, a move that prompted Iran to vow revenge against Washington.
 The US, in turn, warned to attack around 52 Iranian sites, in case Iran launches a war against Washington.
 On Monday, President Duterte sought the repatriation of 1.2 million OFWs in the Middle East, as he feared that the tensions between the US and Iran would harm Filipinos.
 Evacuate to a "safe place" while the government's main goal is to repatriate Filipinos, Panelo said.
 The Palace official said the government is looking for a place in the Middle East that would serve as a temporary home to Filipinos who will be asked to leave Iraq in the meantime.
 Palagay ko (I think), if you will give them a choice between being placed in a safe place and coming home, eh pipiliin nila doon muna sa safe place (they would choose to stay in a safe place), he said.
 We have to place them in a safe place. Hindi naman sila kailangan umuwi habang nagkakaroon ng giyera doon o digmaan. Syempre hindi mo naman maiuuwi 'yan talaga eh. Hahanapan mo ng lugar na ligtas malapit dun like Saudi Arabia (They don't need to return home while there is a war. Of course, you can't repatriate them. You have to look for a safe place near Iraq, like Saudi Arabia), Panelo added.
 The President admitted on Tuesday that his administration is bracing for the possibility that the current stand-off between the US and Iran could turn into a "worst-case" scenario for the Filipinos working in the Gulf states.
 Duterte said he has asked the Department of National Defense to look for ways on how to help the OFWs "make their way out" of the Gulf states.
 He said he has also instructed the Department of Finance to reserve a certain amount for that possible exigency of Filipino migrant workers in the Middle East.
 Panelo said the country's frigates have been deployed near the Middle East to ensure the security of Filipinos.
 He added that the government would provide necessary assistance to OFWs who will go back to the Philippines.
 He also assured them of job opportunities upon their return to the country.
 'Yung mga ongoing projects natin, bibigyan sila ng preference na magkaroon ng trabaho dahil madi-dislocate sila 'pag umuwi sila dito (We have ongoing projects here and they can have their job preference because they will surely get dislocated when they return home), Panelo said.

The Federal Reserve launched a review last year of its policy framework and tools in light of the challenges presented by low inflation and low borrowing costs. Fed officials expect they will quickly cut their short-term interest rate to zero during the next recession, leaving them less room to maneuver. Historically, the central bank has reduced rates by roughly 5 percentage points in a downturn. But its benchmark rate is now in a range of just 1.5% to 1.75%.

The company Cambridge Analytica started by running surveys on Facebook to get information about people. It later pivoted to be an advertising company, part of our Facebook Marketing Partner program, who other companies could hire to run their ads. Their claim to fame was psychographic targeting. This was pure snake oil and we knew it; their ads performed no better than any other marketing partner (and in many cases performed worse). I personally regret letting them stay on the FMP program for that reason alone. However at the time we thought they were just another company trying to find an angle to promote themselves and assumed poor performance would eventually lose them their clients. We had no idea they were shopping an old Facebook dataset that they were supposed to have deleted (and certified to us in writing that they had).
