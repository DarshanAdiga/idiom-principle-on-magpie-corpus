At the same time, pressure has been building on India -- which imports about a third of Venezuela’s remaining production and where Rosneft owns a major refinery -- to cut off purchases from Venezuela. Trump last month visited New Delhi and warned of more U.S. sanctions against those supporting Maduro. Since then, shipping traffic around Venezuela’s ports has ground to a halt as Venezuela struggles to find new buyers for its crude.


  “It’s beyond a perfect storm,” said Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Houston. “Everything is moving in the wrong direction.”


  Now the country will have to contend with oil prices at a multi-year low amid a meltdown in oil markets after Saudi Arabia decided to flood the market to retaliate against Russia’s refusal to go along with a proposed OPEC production cut. On Monday, oil fell by 9.5%, adding to losses of nearly 50% in the past month. Most of the added supply from Saudi Arabia is of the same heavy crude variety that Venezuela produces.


  Monaldi said that with storage facilities already at capacity, production will surely take a further hit, although he said it’s difficult to predict how much, given the ongoing volatility. Making matters worse, authorities pursuing corruption recently arrested several senior PDVSA executives whose job it was to find international buyers.


  Rather than shutting down production, which can be costly and hard to resume, Monaldi expects the company to start selling its oil below cost.


  “When nobody is willing to buy your oil you start to do crazy things,” said Monaldi.


  Maduro has banned most flights in and out of the country, ordered all but essential workers in Caracas and six states to stay at home and even appeared on TV urging Venezuelans to make their own face masks at home.


  “The coronavirus isn’t a game, it’s a deadly threat,” Maduro said in a televised address Friday in which he ordered all levels of government to work around the clock “to protect and defend the people during this crisis.”

Clocking in at 92 pages, Friday's lawsuit filed in the Central District of California said that Netflix wouldn't have been able to upend the traditional cable TV business so effectively without infringing eight Broadcom Corp. patents, which it says cover technologies like data transmission and video playback that are essential to Netflix's video streaming service....

We really liked the idea of doing this partway through the back half [of the season], not in the finale. It felt like Alpha for her side had this kind of epic emotional story with her daughter. And so we wanted to get to a place with the story where we understood that Alpha was ready to kill her own daughter. And that seemed to make sense.

Nicolás Maduro’s government on Monday banned gasoline sales in two states as part of a broader lock-down to stem panic buying by Venezuelans accustomed to hoarding basic goods whenever there’s a hint of turmoil.


  But his orders, which explicitly prohibit lines outside gas stations, were largely ignored in the western city of San Cristobal. At one gas station, tensions boiled over as motorists, some of whom had been stranded four days waiting to fill up, vowed to stay put until sales resumed.

We have shrunk the public space before, but never to the degree that could happen here this spring.
 In the 18th century, when smallpox was a grave threat, people inoculated themselves and then entered self-quarantine; Cotton Mather, the New England Puritan minister and devout advocate of inoculation, spoke of the case of a man who had undergone a procedure that had “given him something of the smallpox and would forever preserve him from it.” Two important figures who stepped away from society for a time in quarantine: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.
 That was a period when it became fashionable to be presentable, at least in terms of hygiene.
 “The cleanliness that was always a part of gentility was thus receiving renewed emphasis around 1800, and the fashion did not recede,” the Columbia University historians Richard L. Bushman and Claudia L. Bushman wrote in their classic article, “The Early History of Cleanliness in America,” published in 1988 in the Journal of American History and replete with examples of American griminess. They added that “the commitment to cleanliness grew ever stronger throughout the 19th century.”
 Now it is a necessity, but the withdrawal from the public sphere that the coronavirus has triggered could bring on social diseases such as isolation, loneliness and depression. And Putnam, the prophet of bowling protocol, is deeply worried. Long before the virus began to spread in China, he prepared a forthcoming book arguing that the United States in the last half-century had moved from a “we” society to an “I” society.
 “An ‘I’ society is actually less able to deal even in the short run with a crisis like coronavirus because dealing with a threat like this requires lots of people to make personal sacrifices for the sake of others,” Putnam said. “Americans today, as opposed to Americans 50 or 60 years ago, are less willing to pay a personal price for the benefit of someone else.”
 Perhaps in isolation, Americans might retreat to the pastime of reading while we await the work of a modern-day version of Edward Jenner, who in 1796 developed the vaccination that halted smallpox. We might pick up Geraldine Brooks’ “Year of Wonders,” the story of the village of Eyam, where to prevent the plague of 1665-66 from spreading beyond their tiny Derbyshire community of less than a thousand, the population voluntarily went into quarantine. Scores died — perhaps three-quarters of them, perhaps half, there is no reliable figure — but the virus was contained.
 The lesson of Eyam? “That we are in this together,” Brooks said in a phone conversation from Paris. “We will stand or fall together, because this is something we can only solve together.” Alone in this, perhaps, but ultimately we are together.

The Cardinals spent Monday building around Murray. In Hopkins, Arizona acquired one of the best receivers in the game. In Drake, Arizona might be able to solidify its running game for the short term.
 Is it enough to take them from last place to contender in a division that includes the past two Super Bowl runners-up in the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers and a perennial playoff team in the Seattle Seahawks?
 Going from five wins to the playoffs in 2020 is not as crazy as it seems. Consider this: The Cardinals lost two games by a field goal last season and three others by less than a touchdown. They tied the Lions in Week 1. That's six winnable games, most of which were played in the infancy of first-year coach Kliff Kingsbury's offense when they were learning on the fly in many ways.
 Adding Hopkins and having Drake for an entire season could be the difference between winning and losing those close games.
 Over the past three seasons, Hopkins led the league in touchdown receptions, was third in receiving yards and is one of four players to be named a first- team All-Pro. He has the second-most catches (632) in his first seven seasons in NFL history. He has at least 1,100 receiving yards in five of the last six seasons. Fitzgerald has done that only once in the last four years.
 Arizona will now be able to pair Hopkins with Murray and add him to Fitzgerald and Christian Kirk. That, alone, should bolster Arizona's passing game to heights not seen since the days of Bruce Arians' aerial attack.
 Last season, the Cardinals' wide receivers averaged a league-low 8.9 air yards per target, according to ESPN Stats & Information. And over the last three years, Arizona's receivers struggled getting the ball downfield, averaging 11.68 yards per reception over that stretch. Hopkins has the talent to change that on his own.

This week's artifact is the work of Burlington native Harold Stienbrecher and dates to 1925.


   


  Steinbrecher received his degree in civil engineering from Iowa State University in 1923, but his passion was cartography. His career took him to Wheaton, Illinois, where he found work as a civil engineer and began to establish a life for himself. However, he soon was called back to Burlington because of his ailing father.


   


  In an effort to keep his cartography skills sharp while tending to his father, he approached then-city engineer Harry Volmer and asked if the city would be interested in having an up-to-date map, free of charge. It's unclear if Volmer was impressed by the young man's ambition, or if he was thrilled with the idea of having the work done for free. Either way, he cleared out a corner of his office, and allowed Steinbrecher to work there.


   


  Steinbrecher worked for six months, tracing subdivisions and land tracts, eventually dividing Burlington into about 100 quarter sections he used for the rest of his time mapping Burlington. Stienbrecher created more than 50 editions of his map books, and never made a dime from them. Rather than selling them for a profit, he chose to sell them at cost to buyers. Today, his work is highly sought by collectors.


   


  At some point in his career, Steinbrecher decided to focus on mapping Crapo Park and the arboretum. He chose Crapo because he felt there was a general lack of interest in public parks nationwide, and because he was heavily involved with the Arbor Day Association. Because of WII, tree planting in the arboretum was put on the back burner, resulting in the loss of many valuable specimens. Steinbrecher was responsible for many of the trees that were either planted or replaced in his lifetime, including a rare hybrid crab apple that came to Burlington by way of Boston, Massachusetts, and then Lisle, Illinois (near Wheaton).


   


  It was because of the interest of Steinbrecher, and that of his brother, Raymond, that we had a granite sign at the South Main Entrance that measured 5' high by 10' long. It was inscribed "Crapo Park and Arboretum Established 1895. In memory of Raymond C. Steinbrecher."

_Coronation Street_ 's __ Geoff Metcalfe and Alya Nazir have been clashing recently, with tensions rising after Alya accused Geoff of stealing money from Speed Daal and mistreating Yasmeen.


  But in tonight's (March 16) episodes, those tensions boiled over, leaving a controlling Geoff to drive a damaging wedge between his wife and her worried granddaughter.


  After convincing Yasmeen (Shelley King) that the pair of them should up sticks and move to Cyprus for a "longer, better life", Geoff (Ian Bartholomew) started making plans to sell her half of the family's street food restaurant.


  Unfortunately for Geoff, Alya (Sair Khan) was working when the valuer popped in and she was left seething when he informed her of what Geoff intended to do.

COVID-19 means things will never be the same. March Madness has for many become March Sadness.


   


  Most serious are those who will be afflicted with grave illness, even loss of loved ones. We're testing the capacity of our modern healthcare system like no other time. We're seeing how tightly interconnected global financial markets are, from effects on the stock market and oil futures, all the way to Main Street and school gymnasiums.


   


  It looks as though those most fragile -- economically and physically -- may take the brunt.


   


  The inadvertent emergence of this virus and its subsequent propagation around the globe reveal how small and interconnected our world has become. The proverbial butterfly flapped its wings somewhere in an inner province of faraway China and it spawned a hurricane on the whole world. Though by all analysis this appears to be inadvertent and unintended, it's easier now to imagine worse and even sinister scenarios.


   


  If one looks to fuel and feed anxiety, frustration, anger, criticism and blame, those things are easily within earshot. Just turn on any cable opinion/news channel, open up social media feeds; you will plenty of shouting and finger pointing.


   


  Albeit, some of that may be deserved, but much of it simply results from what social psychologists call a "VUCA" environment, a natural consequence of important matters being volatile, uncertain, changing and ambiguous.


   


  With so much changing so fast, and seemingly so little under our control, pointing at others, even if well deserved, likely won't serve us. Maybe better advice is that we each take stock of ourselves.


   


  In times of crisis, it's natural that we all look to leaders. Fortunately, each of us has the opportunity to lead, to rescue, even to be a hero.


   


  Responsibility: Consider the word; the ability to choose a response. No, it doesn't mean culpability. No one in Kansas is culpable for this outbreak, but each of us can be responsible -- to ourselves, others, our communities, even to our now much smaller and more interconnected world.


   


  The week's events have given us the opportunity to be better. We all know someone who has been (or will soon be) hurt by these events. Some will lose their health, maybe even a loved one. Some will lose part of their fortunes, maybe all of their income. Some will lose sleep, or maybe the ability to run necessary family errands. Some will be so busy working in our public health and health care system taking care of us that they can't adequately consider their own health and well-being.


   


  With schools closed, thousands will lose a safe place for their children. Shut-ins will lose much-needed human contact. Some will lose their nerve and confidence.


   


  Wisdom says, "It's not what happens to us that determines our destiny, but how we respond to what happens to us."


   


  So, let COVID-19 turn you into a hero. Why not twist the awfulness of these events into something better for our world? Let's all be responsible.

And it's also the first Pixel smartphone to be repairable, at least according to iFixit who gave it a very good score of 6 out of 10. In spite of the presence of too many thin cables that could be torn in case of clumsy action, iFixit assures that they "enjoyed returning to an era of more easily repairable devices".
 A positive point for the Google smartphone is that the screws are in the standard T3 Torx format, so you don't have to change the screwdriver every time you open it. But that's not all, the adhesive that holds the battery seems not to be too resistant, just like the one on the screen. The components are also relatively easy to remove. In short, repairing the Pixel 3a seems to be child's play compared to some other smartphones. Note that the Pixel 1 of the brand also got very good marks, iFixit giving it a 7 out of 10 for example.

  The agency said in response to The Associated Press that neither the CDC nor the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends respirators for the officers and recommends the equipment be reserved for workers in the riskiest situations such as medical personnel.


  “TSA follows OSHA and CDC guidance related to personnel protection,” it said in a written statement.

Además, Johnson ha instado a los ciudadanos a permanecer en aislamiento durante 14 días si alguna de las personas con las que conviven presentan síntomas compatibles con el COVID-19. "Eso significa que si es posible no salgáis, incluso para comprar comida u otros bienes esenciales, a no ser que sea para hacer ejercicio y en ese caso a una distancia segura de otros", ha explicado. Pide a las personas con patologías previas que eviten los contactos sociales durante 12 semanas El mandatario también ha pedido a las personas con "problemas graves de salud" que eviten todo contacto social durante al menos 12 semanas y a las empresas que permitan a sus empleados teletrabajar para reducir el número de contagios. Johnson ha dirigido un mensaje especial a los londinenses, visto que la capital parece ser por ahora la zona más golpeada por el coronavirus en el país. En este sentido, les ha instado a prestar especial atención a las directrices del Gobierno ya que en Londres el virus "va varias semanas por delante" con respecto a otros puntos del país. Por su parte, el asesor jefe científico del Gobierno, Sir Patrick Vallance, ha subrayado que Reino Unido va unas tres semanas por detrás de Italia, por lo que otro tipo de medidas, como el cierre de escuelas, podrían ser necesarias más adelante. "Esas cosas tienen que hacerse en el momento adecuado", ha sostenido. A su vez, el asesor médico jefe, Chris Whitty, ha incidido en que las opciones de morir para una persona dada "son muy bajas". Por el momento, en el país se han contabilizado algo más de 1.500 casos y 36 fallecidos. Además, ha reconocido que a la gente le resulta "muy difícil mantener" las restricciones sociales, pero es algo que evitará que el sistema nacional de salud "se vea desbordado".
