After an exhaustive search and interview process, Cedar County has a new economic developer. Many of you will recognize the name of Nick Allison, son of Davin Allison and Amy Hedrick. Nick is an El Dorado Springs native who graduated from El Dorado Springs R-II schools in 2013 and went on to graduate from Truman State University in Kirksville. The economic developer position is shared between the city of El Dorado Springs, Cedar County commissioners and Kaysinger Basin Regional Planning Commission.


  Allison started in the new position a week ago and is in the process of learning all he can about business expansion, industry attraction and much more. Nick's office will be in the lower level of the Spring Park Community Building.


  As we visited, he asked questions about how the chamber was a partner to him and to our community's economic development. Allison also mentioned he would love to see an infusion of businesses downtown and had some initial ideas on that front. We discussed the Clean-Up El Do campaign and ideas to make El Dorado Springs a more attractive and welcoming place to do business.


  "You have to make it easy for them to say 'yes' when it comes to economic development," Allison said.


  In essence we are selling El Dorado Springs and Cedar County, it's our product. And we need to make our product as appealing as possible to garner more commerce.


  We discussed different forms of economic development, and there are many more types than you might think. Economic development encompasses many areas such as infrastructure, education, health and wellness, transportation, energy, information technology, industrial, tourism, new industry attraction and more. The simple fact is most economic development comes in the form of existing business expansion in our community, more so than an influx of brand-new businesses.


  Allison doesn't have any preconceived notions either. Economic development is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time, sowing of seeds and cultivation. Some forms of economic development are highly competitive and can be a struggle to attract and retain business. When it's in the form of drawing new business/industry competition is further intensified by the use of many variations of economic incentives to the potential business such as tax incentives, investment capital, donated land, utility rate discounts, and many others. We think Allison is up to the challenge, though!


  "I care a lot about this community,” Allison said. “It's where I was raised, and where my family resides. I look forward to working with our existing businesses to see where we might find potential expansion opportunities, research further revitalization possibilities, and the thought of attracting new business to El Dorado Springs is also exciting."


   _Tough is the executive director of the El Dorado Springs Chamber of Commerce._

Much of the opposition to the CAA is based on the fact that it treats people differently based on their religion -- a violation, opponents argue, of India's constitution and of the spirit of its secular democracy. In light of the pending NRC, however, the injustice of the CAA is even more stark. It would potentially allow non-Muslims in that process who for whatever reason lack papers to have access to Indian citizenship anyway while excluding Muslims, thus rendering stateless many Muslims who have functionally been citizens of India for their entire lives.

A Newcomerstown native has continued her drive through recognition in her duty to the Ohio State Patrol.  
 Marla Gaskill, who has raised the bar for women in the Ohio State Highway Patrol and has been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel by Ohio State Highway Patrol, was congratulated by Colonel Richard S.

L'indice de référence en question montre que le Ryzen 7 4700H gagne 8 350 points dans le score physique 3DMark Time Spy, qui mesure exclusivement les performances du processeur. Ce score ne correspond pas tout à fait aux autres processeurs de bureau de niveau supérieur d'AMD comme le Ryzen 7 3700X, qui a obtenu un éblouissant 10180.
 Cependant, ce benchmark divulgué suggère qu'il renversera les puces de bureau Intel haut de gamme comme l'Intel Core i7-9700K. La puce de Team Blue ne réussit qu'à gagner 8 200 points dans l'indice de référence. Ce n'est pas loin derrière le 4800H, mais il est toujours derrière.
 Le fait que le Ryzen 7 4800H bat la puce Intel n'est pas aussi gros (surtout compte tenu de la marge étroite) que le fait qu'il soit en compétition du tout. N'oubliez pas qu'il s'agit d'un processeur mobile avec de plus grandes contraintes de puissance thermique qu'une puce de bureau comme le Core i7-9700K.
 ## Beaucoup reste inconnu
 Ce n'est pas la première fois que nous constatons des fuites de référence montrant de nouveaux processeurs mobiles Ryzen apportant des niveaux de performances impressionnants. Auparavant, nous avions également vu la variante "U" de la prochaine puce d'AMD, qui est un modèle de faible puissance.
 Bien sûr, nous devons prendre cette fuite avec quelques grains de sel, étant donné que la puce n'a pas encore fait son chemin sur le marché. Nous devrons simplement attendre et voir de quoi le Ryzen 7 4800H est capable quand il fera son chemin dans les ordinateurs portables dans les prochains mois.
 Bien que ce soit une excellente nouvelle pour le marché des ordinateurs portables de voir de véritables performances de bureau dans ce qui sera probablement un package abordable, Intel a quelques-unes de ses propres astuces dans son sac.
 Nous prévoyons déjà qu'Intel Tiger Lake fera progresser les performances de Team Blue en ce qui concerne les ordinateurs portables minces et légers, et ses puces Comet Lake H-Series de 10e génération pour les ordinateurs portables de jeu sont également en route. Avec ce type de compétition, 2020 sera une sacrée année pour les ordinateurs portables.

Parasite has amassed a box office revenue of US$137 million globally, and is set to rake in more with this slew of awards and nominations.


  Exceeding everybody’s expectations, this subversive anti-capitalist film is winning over both critics and audiences. So much so, there is already a rumoured HBO series spin-off in the works.


  Parasite’s accomplishments come off the back of Joon-ho’s previous critical success with the 2017 ecological fantasy Okja, Park Chan-wook’s 2018 film Handmaiden (the first Korean film to be nominated for and win a Bafta) and Lee Chang-dong’s 2018 film Burning (the first Korean film to make it to shortlist for best foreign film at the Oscars).


  If this momentum is anything to go by, the “Korean Wave” is only set to get bigger.

At the center of June Medical Services v. Gee is Act 620, Louisiana's "Unsafe Abortion Protection Act," a 2014 state law not currently in effect. Similar to a Texas law that was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016, Louisiana's law requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 30 miles away. If the law is allowed to be implemented, all of Louisiana's abortion clinics would close, as first reported by CBS News.

Hold yourself accountable by spending a moment before bed every night to record and celebrate your last 24 hours. Seeing your transition come to life on paper will keep you inspired and allow you to track your progress as you make meaningful change towards a more purposeful life.
