Hebo Women’s Book Club met for February last week at South Tillamook County Library. Melanie Merryman led the discussion and provided refreshments. Other attendees included Ginger Allen, Madlen Silkwood, Nancy Whitehead and Joan Wilke. I was feeling under the weather and missed out. The group discussed “A Gentleman in Moscow” by Amor Towles which tells the story of a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel. Melanie reports that “everyone loved the book.” I’ll amend the unanimous decision to say that I eventually loved the book myself. However, I truly didn’t warm up to it until I was nearly two hundred pages in; so don’t say I didn’t warn you!
 Serendipitously, this month’s installment in my Oregon Symphony season featured the work of Russian composer, Dmitri Shostakovich. The piece was Symphony number 11, titled “The Year 1905.” The music lasted more than an hour and was brilliantly conducted and played, bringing both my seatmate and me repeatedly to tears. Along with the book, I heartily recommend this powerful music that reflects the same period in history at the same place on the map.
 I visited Antonette’s Kitchen South for lunch to go this afternoon. Owner Toni Lamers prepared a House Salad identical in every way to the version I’ve purchased at her Tillamook food cart weekly for some time now.

PARIS — The French government won its first parliamentary fight on Wednesday over an overhaul of the country's byzantine pensions system, clearing a key hurdle despite fierce protests and weeks of chaos wrought by the largest transport strike in decades.
 President Emmanuel Macron's most ambitious reform to date passed in the national assembly shortly after midnight, after his centrist majority survived two no-confidence votes.
 The bids to topple the government came after it employed a rare constitutional measure to cut short a debate that had become bogged down in a morass of opposition amendments, effectively forcing the bill through.
 Trade unions and opposition parties slammed the move as anti-democratic, but their calls for fresh protests against a bill that triggered the crippling French transport strike this winter went largely unheeded.
 The bill now moves to the Senate, where it again faces a barrage of amendments intended to slow its passage, before heading back for final approval by the national assembly before the summer.
 Critics say the introduction of a single, points-based system will force millions of people to work beyond the official retirement age of 62, or face lower pensions.
 The government argues that abolishing the country's 42 separate pension regimes, which offer early retirement and other benefits mainly to public- sector workers, will be fairer and end years of deficits.
 Prime Minister Edouard Philippe hailed the text as a victory for "social justice", saying that "those who defend the status quo... too often are just talking nonsense".
 But the opposition vowed to keep up the fight, urging voters to sanction Macron's Republic on the Move party in the nationwide municipal elections that begin March 15.
 "Punishment will come at the polls," the far-left France Unbowed lawmaker Eric Coquerel said on Twitter. "This ignoble law will not pass."


 Questions remain


 If passed, the reform will be phased in over the coming years for people born since 1975 but will not affect the pensions of those already nearing retirement age.
 Macron's overhaul is the most extensive in a series of pension reforms enacted by successive governments on both the left and right, aiming to end chronic budget shortfalls as people live longer.
 A government commission estimated last year that the deficit could reach as much as 17 billion euros ($19 billion) by 2025 if no changes are made.
 Yet, many details of the reform, including how much a point will be worth when people retire, have yet to be determined.
 Many people remain sceptical of the new system, with 56 per cent of voters in an Ifop poll published on February 13 saying they opposed a points-based method.
 The government has promised to negotiate with unions on how to finance the new system, but it has already warned that if no deal is reached people will have to work beyond 62, one of the lowest retirement ages in the EU.

Biden is running as a moderate, in contrast to the leftist Sanders, but Trump insisted that some of the former vice president's "handlers are further left than Bernie."
 Trump noted that decisions by two centrists -- Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar -- to drop out and endorse Biden had electrified his previously struggling campaign.
 Trump lambasted the weak performance by Bloomberg, who spent hundreds of millions of dollars of his own fortune on advertising.
 "He's going to try and save face by putting some money into Biden's campaign," Trump said. "I don't think that's going to have an impact.
 "He's doing that because he's spiteful," Trump added of Bloomberg. "He made a fool out of himself."
 Biden's campaign had been on life support after the first three state nominating contests but was revived by a landslide victory in South Carolina on Saturday. He carried that momentum over into Super Tuesday, the biggest day of the election calendar so far.
 Biden notched up victories in Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Maine and even Minnesota -- a state where Sanders had been expected to win handily.
 Sanders won his home state Vermont, Colorado and Utah and looked to be headed for victory in California, the biggest prize of the night, as vote counting continued on Wednesday.
 Bloomberg, 78, said that while he was leaving the race, he remained committed to beating Trump.
 "I've always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it," Bloomberg said.
 "After yesterday's vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden."
 A key takeaway from Biden's long list of wins was his strong support among women and African Americans -- a vital piece in any Democratic presidential candidate's coalition.
 Biden seemed to fare less well with the large Hispanic electorate, which in California reportedly went heavily for Sanders. But a victory in Texas, which also has a diverse population, suggests Biden has the capacity to build a broad coalition.
 Many in the Democratic Party establishment have been desperate to stop Sanders, claiming he would be destroyed in an election where Trump would brand him a radical socialist.
 Most national polls have both Biden and Sanders several points ahead of Trump in a general election matchup.

“It’s not that I don’t expect it. It’s not going to happen. It’s not,” Carville said.
 In his March 3 appearance on MSNBC, Carville emphasized how important the participation of African American and female voters is in the Democratic presidential nomination, referencing 2018 midterm elections being largely
 defined by new female voters showing out for the Democratic Party. On Super Tuesday, these demographic groups showed up in large numbers at the polling booths for Biden.
 Super Tuesday’s results have upended Sanders’ status of the front runner. The outcome of Super Tuesday has left Biden with a considerable delegate lead.
 Coming off a big win in South Carolina on Feb. 29, Biden’s campaign, thought to be dead in the water just weeks ago, swept southern states that held primaries on Tuesday. Alongside a dominant performance in Virginia, where he captured 63% of the vote, and an unexpected victory in Massachusetts, Biden has accumulated a lead of over 60 delegates.
 It is still too early to see a clear nominee for the Democratic Party, as no candidate has yet to crack 600 delegates, and 1,991 delegates are needed to secure the nomination. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, there was a 69% chance that no clear nominee would arise from the Democratic primaries heading into Super Tuesday, splitting the other 31% almost down the middle between the two frontrunners, with a slight edge for Sanders over Biden.
 Carville’s thoughts on Sanders’ campaign weaknesses was met with some pushback. Less than a week after an MSNBC appearance by Carville on Feb. 5 where Carville explained the fallacy of Sanders’ philosophy, an article in The New Republic by Ed Burmila chastised Bill Clinton’s former strategist, stating his analysis of Sanders “represents much that’s wrong with the Democratic Party.” Burmila went on to say Carville’s thoughts on how candidates should approach their campaigns are outdated and too obsessed with “swing voters.”
 Carville extended an invitation to Burmila to Skype into his class at the University to “explain to [Carville’s] students why he thinks their professor is obsolete.”
 Carville has yet to receive a response.

The board is also not planning at this point to post online any information supplied by the applicants, though it may do so when interviews occur, Gaudet said. That information includes candidate résumés, letters of interest, job references and college transcripts.


  The Advocate, however, obtained that information via a public records request and has posted it online.


  Gaudet said that each board member has been busy on their own rating the applications. The lists of each board member, which are to have no more than seven names, will be unveiled Thursday night and the applicants on the most lists will be the ones asked back for interviews, he said.


  Besides naming its favorite applicants, JG Consulting has given the board no additional written information evaluating the applicants, but the search firm has been available for board members with questions, Gaudet said — though he said he hasn’t needed to go there.


  “I’ve done a lot of research on this myself,” he said. “With the internet you can go pretty far.”


  While the agenda mentions the possibility that the board will go behind closed doors into executive session to discuss the applicants, Gaudet said he’s not expecting that will be necessary. And before the board votes on who to interview, members of the public will have a chance to speak.


  “I hope we don’t have 85 people to stand up to talk about one person, but if that’s the way it is, that’s the way it is,” Gaudet said.


  After the first round of interviews on March 23 and 24, the board has the option of holding a second round of interviews. The timeline contemplates the board making a final selection sometime in April. The board’s regularly scheduled meetings that month are set for April 9 and April 23.

Barber wears disposable gloves with her when she shops as a precautionary measure. She is not worried about being out around town, but as of recently, is avoiding unnecessary shopping trips for clothes or groceries.
 “It doesn’t scare me to go out. But If somebody is standing there coughing, without a mask on, I don’t think they should be in the (grocery) store,” she said.
 As soon as Barber gets back from her shopping trips, she puts her gloves in a bag and throws the gloves away once she gets home. Although Barber takes extra precautions, when it comes to the coronavirus, “if you get it, you get it,” she said.
 Michele Gedrose, director of Continuing Education at Wenatchee Valley College, is also not terribly concerned about going out. People need to not become so scared that they stop going about their lives in a normal manner, she said while sitting at a table in Pybus Public Market.
 But, just because Wenatchee residents live in a more rural area, does not mean the coronavirus will not hit over here. The fact that a student who attended classes at WVC is being tested for the coronavirus “hits home,” she said.
 It solidified the idea that “this is here, and no one is safe from it,” she said. “That was a wake-up call, that it can happen anywhere.”
 Gedrose knows if she does happen to get sick, at least she can stay home, but worries about others who have jobs that do not share her same benefits. “I’m lucky enough that I do have sick leave,” she said. But it is a little terrifying that other people do not.
 People just have to be diligent in washing their hands and not congregating in large groups, she said. “I’m cautious, but I’m not going to stop doing what I’m doing,” she said.
 Linda Cantu, an orthodontics receptionist in Wenatchee, said she put signs up to let people know they should stay home if they are feeling sick, rather than come into her office. A lot of people come in for appointments at work, coughing and sneezing all over the place, she said at Pybus on her lunch break with coworkers.
 Regardless of whether people stay home, there is nothing anyone can do except wait and see if the coronavirus eventually goes away, she said. “I think we all are a little nervous but it is kind of out of our control, we can’t do anything about it.”
 Earlier in the week, Cantu said, Costco nearly sold out of water, sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer. “Everybody is kind of worried,” she said.
 When this first started happening, Cantu bought supplies such as Lysol wipes. Now, she is taking it a step further by stocking up on non-perishable groceries like frozen foods, canned foods, water and medications.
 The flu, AIDS and suicide alone have all killed more people than the coronavirus, she said. People are just scared because they don’t know how fast the coronavirus can spread.
 “Right now, it’s not something to worry too much about,” she said. And, “hopefully it doesn’t affect too many of us.”

“I think, at the end of the season, you have to have a few wrinkles,” he said. “There are things that are a little different, but basically we have to stay true to who we are as a team and as an offense.

 The Raiders said his team will need to keep track of Brown and Lauren Hauser, who averages 10 points per game for the Vikings.
 “There are times we play with a lot of pressure,” Shaw said. “They have really good shooters, so you really have to guard the arch. We have to make sure that we’re extending out on them. We have to make sure we rebound really hard because they have a couple kids who really crash the boards.”
 Height-wise, Shaw said the teams are pretty even.
 “We’re pretty comparable. They got a couple kids who are around six foot. We have a couple kids who are around six foot,” he said. “It wasn’t like last year when we played Elkhorn South and they had a 6-4 girl out there.”
 Shaw said his team will have to play solidly on both sides of the ball to come up with the win against Northwest.
 “Honestly, we’re going to have to limit their shooting from the arch. We’re going to have to make them play defense in the half court and really attack them. At this stage in the season, every team is solid. We just have to play a good game and shoot well to be in the hunt,” he said.
 Mattie Johnson is average 14.7 points per game for the Raiders. Karly Sylvester adds 9.4 points per game and 7.2 rebounds.

Thomas Tuchel praised hat-trick hero Kylian Mbappe for his response after finding it "difficult" against Borussia Dortmund, with the forward's partnership alongside Neymar crucial to Paris Saint-Germain.
 With PSG lining up in an unfamiliar 4-3-3 formation, Mbappe struggled to make an impact during the first leg of the last-16 Champions League tie away in Dortmund last month.
 However, since the 2-1 defeat in Europe, France international Mbappe has flourished in domestic action, scoring six goals in three games.
 Mbappe's hat-trick on Wednesday helped PSG progress to the Coupe de France final in style, with head coach Tuchel delighted at the 21-year-old's display in the 5-1 thrashing of Lyon.
 "Mbappe's been very strong these last few weeks. He had a tough time in Dortmund playing in a different position. It was clearly difficult for him against Dortmund," Tuchel told the media.
 "With Neymar, they're very strong together. After Dortmund, Mbappe showed a great reaction after every training session and during the games against Dijon and Lyon.
 "He's very strong, he uses his speed very well, he's very decisive. He's really in good shape."
 Neymar also scored in the rout, converting a second-half penalty after Marcal was deemed to have handled the ball inside the area midweek.
 The Lyon defender received a second yellow card as punishment, allowing PSG to cut loose against 10 men. Mbappe added two more goals following his first-half equaliser, while Pablo Sarabia also scored late on.
 Tuchel pointed to Neymar as the catalyst for the team to produce such "extraordinary performances", the Brazilian benefiting from playing regularly after returning from a rib issue.
 "Neymar was very strong, he's still dangerous. For him, the most important thing is that he plays," the former Dortmund boss said.
 "He's a player who helps us to do extraordinary performances, with extraordinary results. He has to play, and it's good that he played 90 minutes.
 "It is also good to have another game to play before Dortmund against Strasbourg. He needs that, he has the ability to play a lot, and when he plays a lot, he is super strong."
 Neymar scored PSG's goal against Dortmund but criticised the way the club managed his injury following the defeat, insisting he had wanted to play prior to the trip to Germany.

A Denison man learned Wednesday that he could spend up to the next 40 years in prison for shooting a man in the head over a drug debt and drug possession charges.


   


  A statement from the Grayson County District Attorney's Office said Christopher Bennett, 35, of Denison pleaded guilty to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine on December 19. Bennett accepted a plea agreement with the Grayson County Criminal District Attorney's Office which allowed the Court to set punishment on both offenses to not more than 40 years in prison. Wednesday, Judge Jim Fallon of the 15th District Court heard evidence and sentenced Bennett to the maximum sentence of 40 years.


   


  On September 17, 2019, Denison police responded to a call of shots fired and discovered an individual had been shot in the head. Detective John Watt quickly ascertained the identity of the shooter as Bennett and obtained a warrant for his arrest. Ultimately, the investigation uncovered that Bennett shot another man over an outstanding drug debt of approximately $100 dollars. The victim was transported to TMC with non-life threating injuries; although a bullet from Bennett's gun had struck him in the head, it exited the victim's skin without penetrating his skull.


   


  Two days later, near the Sherman Public Library, Sherman officers stopped a vehicle in which Bennett was a passenger. Bennett was arrested for his outstanding felony warrant and a subsequent search of the vehicle revealed several grams of methamphetamine, multiple baggies, and a scale.


   


  Evidence presented at the punishment hearing showed Bennett had been previously sentenced to prison for an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon conviction in 2012.


   


  "Investigator Watt and both the Denison and Sherman police departments' swift action took this offender off the street quickly," said Assistant District Attorney Nathan Young. He added that, "everyone - including the defendant - was incredibly fortunate that the victim escaped relatively unscathed and that this was not a murder case." District Attorney Brett Smith added, "Mr. Bennett will be required to serve, at a minimum, the next 20 years in prison, because the crime involved the use of a firearm. The removal of this defendant from our community can only increase public safety."

LONDON - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will appear together at an official engagement on Thursday for the first time since January's announcement that they would step away from their royal duties. The appearance by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as Queen Elizabeth's grandson and Meghan are officially known, at an awards ceremony for wounded service personnel will also be one of their last before they quit as working members of the royal family. The couple will stop their royal duties at the end of the month as they seek to carve out a progressive new role , mainly based in North America, which they aim to finance themselves. While Harry remains a prince, they have agreed not to use the HRH titles - His or Her Royal Highness - and will not use royal in their branding, even though they said there was no jurisdiction by the monarchy or the government to stop them using the word overseas. The couple have spent most of their time in Canada since January's shock announcement. Meghan's last official engagement was to visit Canada House in London days before that announcement. The prince returned to royal duties at the end of last month, when the host at the event said people should just call him Harry . On Thursday, the couple will attend the annual Endeavour Fund Awards at Mansion House which acknowledges the achievements of wounded or sick servicemen and women who have taken part in remarkable sporting and adventure challenges. Harry, sixth in line to the throne, will carry out a solo engagement on Friday when he opens a new museum dedicated to British motor racing where he will be joined by Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton. Next week, Harry, 35 and Meghan, 38, will carry out what is expected to be their last official appearance alongside other senior royals including the 93-year-old queen, Harry's father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, and his brother Prince William at the annual Commonwealth Service at London's Westminster Abbey. British newspapers have reported that the queen has been saddened that she has seen so little of Harry and Meghan's son Archie, her eighth great-grandchild who has remained in Canada. Harry and the queen had a meeting to discuss his future at her Windsor Castle home last weekend, a royal source confirmed, with the Sun tabloid reporting it had been a heart to heart talk at which she said he would always be welcomed to rejoin the royal fold.

 Poynette (10-14) earned the top seed in its sectional grouping over second- seeded Cambridge (12-12), largely due to its victory back in December. In that win, Poynette junior Megan Reddeman led all scorers with 16 points, while fellow junior Jalynn Morter chipped in with 10 points.

“Really for most of the spring my fastball command's good, so I think it's just a continuation of the process of working on it,” Cease said.
 The White Sox are hoping Cease becomes a regular in their rotation this season. Cease, who was acquired in the July 2017 trade that sent José Quintana to the crosstown Cubs, made his major league debut July 3 and went 4-7 with a 5.79 ERA in 14 starts.
 The 24-year-old Cease ran his fastball into the upper-90s against Milwaukee. He struck out the side in the second, including punchouts of veterans Avisaíl García and Jedd Gyorko.
 “Whenever I'm facing anyone, especially in a big league spring training game, they're all good hitters,” Cease said. “But to get big league guys out, that's definitely a confidence booster.”
 Cease said it was a hanging curveball that Hiura crushed to straightaway center field.
 “Based on how he hit it I think it was hanging,” a grinning Cease said. “I don't know for sure.”
 Brewers right-hander Brandon Woodruff pitched three effective innings in his third spring start, allowing an unearned run and three hits. He went 11-3 last year with a 3.62 ERA in 22 starts.

It was the game that transformed women’s cricket in India and yet it will forever be a game that Deepti Sharma tries to forget. At the time when Deepti came out to bat against England in the 2017 World Cup final at Lord’s, India could literally smell the Cup. One good effort and history would be made. Unfortunately, pressure got the best of Deepti and India ended up second best. She got another opportunity in 2018 in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean against the same opponents and again she didn’t perform to potential getting run out for seven and picking up a solitary wicket for 24 in her 4 over spell. Will she be third time lucky when India take on England yet one more time in the semi-final of the T20 World Cup on Thursday? Deepti, not as flamboyant as Smriti Mandhana or as popular as Harmanpreet Kaur or Shafali Verma, is a critical cog in the Indian wheel. Not only will Deepti open the bowling against the likes of Amy Jones and Danny Wyatt, she will surely be Harmanpreet’s go to bowler in the powerplay against the inform Natalie Sciver and Heather Knight. Both of these batswomen have been in stellar form for England all through the competition and it will be on Deepti and Shikha Pandey to restrict England in the first six overs of the game. And, as a batswoman, it might well be that Deepti is entrusted with the task of a finisher, a job she has performed well numerous times in the recent past. While Shafali and Poonam Yadav were celebrated for their contributions in the opening game against Australia, it was Deepti’s fighting unbeaten 49 that made sure India were still in the game at the half-way stage. And thereafter she bowled a tidy spell conceding only 17 in her 4 overs besides having a hand in the run out of Delissa Kimmince together with Jemima Rodrigues. Deepti, as is often the case, passes under the radar and is not much spoken about. And yet she remains India’s go to player and is perhaps the most complete all-round cricketer in the team at the moment. “She is extremely talented,” said Jhulan Goswami, who was instrumental in getting Deepti to play for Bengal in domestic cricket. “With Deepti, you have it all. She’s still very young and yet has matured into a very good finisher and can bowl with skill in the powerplay. Most importantly, she is a more than handy fielder in the deep and very rarely drops a catch.” “With Deepti, you know you have someone in the side who will always give her 200 per cent. More often than not she will stand up,” said India’s head coach WV Raman, while speaking about the diminutive all-rounder. Twice in the past her 200 per cent has not been enough. Deepti will know this is perhaps her best chance to make a difference and set things right. In 2017, the big stage was alien to her and she wasn’t able to deal with the situation mentally. In 2018, things weren’t okay in the Indian dressing room and the fragility of the top order cost India the game. This time round, under Raman, things look in fine fettle. Deepti, however, will not be thinking any of this. All she will have on her mind is the opportunity to play in the World Cup final.

The water wars continue between Shakopee Public Utilities and the city of Shakopee, and this time, possible legal action could be in the works.
 At a Dec. 16 Shakopee Public Utilities Commission meeting, the utility changed its payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT, to 4.4% of its electric sales and 4.4% of its water sales — a change Shakopee Finance Director Nathan Reinhardt said would have amounted to an average of $22,000 less per year based on SPUC’s last five years of contributions. The city has since pushed back against the PILOT change, citing SPUC’s lack of negotiation with the city.
 At the March 4 Shakopee City Council meeting, the council passed a motion to reject that decision.
 Councilmember Matt Lehman, who also serves as the SPUC liaison, cast the dissenting vote, saying he agreed with SPUC’s decision to change its PILOT calculation, but added he did believe the case should be brought to a judge for a final decision.
 Councilmember Angela Contreras was not present for the meeting.
 “(SPUC’s) intention was to not have a negative impact on the city or water users,” Lehman said, “but I’d like to see a judge make a ruling on whether they have the authority to unilaterally make that action.”
 Shakopee Mayor Bill Mars, a former SPUC commissioner, was adamant that SPUC and the city had historically agreed upon SPUC’s PILOT to the city.
 “There’s a lot of discussion about money,” Mars said. “I think the crux of what we’re trying to do is that this PILOT is by agreement. They took action, and we’re asking them to rescind that action.”
 Mars added an email from a SPU staff member sent March 4 indicated the commission has the authority to make the calculation change without the city’s input.
 “I firmly believe we are operating under agreement,” Mars said.
 The passed motion comes at a time of tension between the two entities, each of which has blamed the other for an unwillingness to meet.
 “To date, SPUC has proven to be an unwilling partner and the organization continues to display rogue behaviors that cause the council concern,” the city wrote in a Feb. 28 statement. “The council resolution specifically asks for SPUC to rescind its decision to unilaterally change its contribution formula and to meet with the council to negotiate a solution.”
 The statement goes on to claim that SPUC has repeatedly shown “no willingness” to meet in a public forum to discuss the ongoing issues.
 "Let’s be clear: this is not about the city wanting more money from SPUC," the statement said. "We agree the formula could be changed and are confident a mutual agreement to the benefit of residents could be achieved. However, unilateral decision-making that SPUC is engaging in is not in the best interest of residents."
 SPUC Utilities Manager John Crooks said the utility “adamantly disagrees” with the fact that the commission has declined to meet with the city, saying the commission can document 16 times when it’s tried to reach out to City Administrator Bill Reynolds this year.
 “Mr. Reynolds said (a joint meeting) would be discussed at the Feb. 18 council meeting. I’ve received nothing from the city council,” Crooks said. “So we’re kind of in that holding pattern. It’s just really unfortunate.”
 Crooks said because the city council designates a liaison — council member Matt Lehman — to attend SPUC meetings, and since its meeting agendas are open to the public, the commission did not feel the need to explicitly notify the city of the change.
 “That’s how we’ve communicated for years and years,” Crooks said. “Our position is that it’s the liaison’s duty, because we always discuss these matters before they’re implemented.”
 Thomson, the city’s attorney, said statute requires SPUC to notify the city when changes to the PILOT are being made, and this time around, the city was technically notified through Lehman.
 “The 2001 resolution by SPUC does mention discussion with council, but there was no separate resolution adopted by the council,” Thomson said.
 If SPUC does not rescind their PILOT calculation change decision by March 31, Shakopee City Council will pursue legal judgement against the utility.

Although having such information is critical to the agency’s work and to the protection of public health, the device supply chain is more complex than the drug supply chain. Drug ingredients are typically manufactured at one or just a few facilities, whereas devices often have components manufactured in dozens of facilities. As a result, device companies have indicated that it would be extremely burdensome to satisfy FDA's desired mandates, potentially requiring them to divert resources from research and development and manufacturing. It is yet to be seen whether, in light of the current coronavirus situation, these issues are compelling counterarguments to the FDA’s policy position. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), who sits on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has expressed interest in drug and device shortages in light of the coronavirus outbreak and could be an ally of the agency in enacting the desired authorities. These new authorities could be incorporated into the FY2021 spending bill or other health care legislation​ pending for 2020.

Los Angeles, Mar 5 AFP The death toll in the United States from the new coronavirus rose to 11 on Wednesday, as lawmakers in Congress agreed to provide more than USD 8 billion to fight the rapidly spreading disease. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared an emergency as he reported the states first fatality from the COVID-19 illness -- an elderly person who had taken a cruise to Mexico -- while health officials in nearby Washington state said a 10th person had died there.The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus, Newsom told reporters. This emergency proclamation will help the state further prepare our communities and our health care system in the event it spreads more broadly. Earlier in the day, Los Angeles County officials reported six new cases in the West Coast metropolis, while the number of confirmed cases in New York state rose to 11.One of the Los Angeles cases concerns a medical screener at the citys international airport checking overseas travelers for symptoms. The Department of Homeland Security said the worker was under self-quarantine at home along with family members and was showing mild symptoms.That persons last shift at the airport was on February 21 and the symptoms began on February 29, a statement said. DHS is happy to report that this individual was highly trained and did everything right both on the job and when they began to feel sick, the statement said.We are told the individual wore all the correct protective equipment and took necessary protections on the job. Nationwide, more than 130 people have so far been infected, with the virus detected in more than a dozen states. Most of the deaths have been in Washington state including residents of a nursing home. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi meanwhile said Republicans and Democrats had reached a deal to fund the response to the outbreak to the tune of 8.3 billion. The House of Representatives passed the measure, and the Senate was to vote on Thursday.Vice President Mike Pence, who is the White Houses pointman on the crisis, told reporters he would be traveling to Minnesota on Thursday to visit a 3M plant manufacturing personal protective equipment including masks. He will then visit Washington state and meet with Governor Jay Inslee to review containment efforts in the Seattle area.All of the newly infected individuals in Los Angeles were exposed to COVID-19 through close contact, health officials said. Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said three of the cases concerned travelers who had gone together to northern Italy -- a virus hotspot with more than 100 deaths.Two other cases involved individuals who had come in contact with a family member who had the virus and the last was the airport screener. The step were taking today is about preparation, not panic, said Mayor Eric Garcetti of the emergency declaration.Officials said they expected the number of infections in California to rise in the coming days and urged families to brace for possible school closures and the cancelation of public events. Statewide, more than 50 people are known to be infected, the most of any state.In Washington state, officials in King County, which includes Seattle and where most of the deaths have taken place, said they were purchasing an 85-bed motel to house patients stricken with the virus.

 Neymar coolly converted to make it 2-1, leading to the Brazilian being the target for objects thrown from the stands, and from then on PSG cut loose against 10 men, giving the final score a lopsided look to it.
 Mbappe finished a solo run by flashing a shot beyond Anthony Lopes and then tapped home Neymar's cross at the second attempt to complete his treble in added time, with his late double sandwiching a goal from Pablo Sarabia.
 Buoyed by back-to-back home wins over Juventus and rivals Saint-Etienne, Lyon had stood toe-to-toe when at full strength, including claiming an early lead when Martin Terrier swept home Karl Toko Ekambi's low cross.
 Yet their advantage lasted less than three minutes, Mbappe providing the finishing touch at the back post from close range after Layvin Kurzawa had flicked on Sarabia's corner. The defender's assist for the equaliser came at a personal cost, though, as he suffered a cut in a clash of heads.
 Having finished impressively earlier in proceedings, Terrier failed to show such composure when a dummy from Moussa Dembele put him in the clear, poking a tame effort straight at Keylor Navas.
 Edinson Cavani had a goal correctly ruled out for offside and also struck the post before the end of the first half, though Lyon were the team in the ascendency until Marcal's indiscretion, with the penalty awarded after a VAR check.
 PSG's triumph means they may well get the chance for revenge against Rennes, the team who denied them the trophy last season. The holders are at Saint- Etienne in the second semi-final on Thursday.

Data reports released Wednesday painted a U.S. economy that was still holding up, at least as of last month. The country's services industries grew at a faster rate last month than economists expected, according to a report from the Institute for Supply Management. Hiring at private employers was stronger than expected in February, according to a report from payroll processor ADP, though slower than January's pace. That could be an encouraging sign for the comprehensive jobs report coming from the government at the end of the week.


  Markets have been on edge for two weeks, with the S&P 500 down 7.6% from its record on Feb. 19, amid worries about how much economic damage the coronavirus will do. The big swings in recent days will likely continue until investors get a sense of what the worst-case scenario really is in the virus outbreak. They need to see the number of new infections at least slow its acceleration, analysts say.


  Indexes jumped on Monday, and the Dow had its best day in more than a decade on rising anticipation for coordinated support from the Fed and other central banks. That followed a dismal week that erased gains for 2020.


  MARKET ROUNDUP:


  The S&P 500 rose 126.75 points, or 4.2%, to 3,130.12. The benchmark index has had five days in the last two weeks where it swung by more than 3%. In all of last year, it had just one.


  The Dow gained 1,173.45 points to 27,090.86. The Nasdaq climbed 334 points, or 3.8%, to 9,018.09. The index, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, now has a slight gain for the year.


  The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks rose 45.11 points, or 3%, to 1,531.20.


  The tide also rose for stocks around the world on Wednesday. In Europe, Germany's DAX climbed 1.2%, the French CAC 40 rose 1.3% and the FTSE 100 in London gained 1.4%. In Asia, South Korea's Kospi jumped 2.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 inched up 0.1%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.2% and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.


  The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.06% from 1.01% late Tuesday after earlier dipping back below 1%. Yields tend to rise with expectations for the economy and inflation. Shorter-term yields fell as traders increased bets for more rate cuts from the Fed later this year. The two-year Treasury yield fell to 0.69% from 0.71%.


  In commodities trading, benchmark crude oil fell 40 cents to settle at $46.78 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, dropped 73 cents to close at $51.13 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.56 per gallon. Heating oil was unchanged at $1.53 per gallon. Natural gas rose 3 cents to $1.83 per 1,000 cubic feet.


  Gold fell $1.40 to $1,643 per ounce, silver rose 6 cents to $17.25 per ounce and copper rose 1 cent to $2.59 per pound.


  The dollar rose to 107.33 Japanese yen from 107.24 yen on Tuesday. The euro weakened to $1.1139 from $1.1176.

Due to the cutting edge innovations in the realm of healthcare IT, there has been a strong demand for operating room management systems in the various hospitals all over the world. The healthcare sector is focusing on improving their services and efficiency and operations, and at the same time decrease the cost incurred on such activities. In order to achieve this, hospitals are focusing on providing state of the art operating rooms, which have all the latest facilities and enable better coordination and communication between different teams of surgeons and the support staff. Also, with such high-end technology, the number of operations that can be performed in a single operating room increases, also increasing the safety and efficacy of the operations performed. This attracts more number of patients to such hospitals where such kind of advanced operating rooms are available, thereby increasing the revenues of such hospitals.

WASHINGTON — The Democratic-controlled House passed an $8.3 billion measure Wednesday to battle the coronavirus outbreak that's spreading rapidly and threatening a major shock to the economy and disruptions to everyday life in the U.S.


  The swift and sweeping bipartisan vote was a relative rarity in a polarized Washington and came just nine days after the president outlined a $2.5 billion plan that both Trump's GOP allies and Democratic critics said was insufficient.


  The 415-2 vote came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi beat a tactical retreat on vaccine price guarantees and followed a debate that lasted only a few minutes.


  "The government's greatest responsibility is to keep Americans safe," said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. "This emergency supplemental addresses the coronavirus and takes critical steps to protect the American people from this deadly and expanding outbreak."


  The Senate is likely to pass the measure Thursday and send it to the White House for Trump's signature. The legislation came together in little more than a week — and more than triples Trump's request — sped along by fears of the outbreak's growing threat.


  Trump is sure to sign the measure, which has the blessing of top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and top House Republican Kevin McCarthy of California.


  "This moment calls for collaboration and unity," McConnell said. "It's time to give our public health experts and healthcare professionals the surge resources they need at this challenging time."


  The agreement came together after Pelosi, D-Calif., dropped a demand, opposed by Republicans and the drug industry, to guarantee that any vaccines and drug treatments developed with government-backed research — but manufactured by drug companies — be offered at "affordable" prices. Pelosi opted to avoid a confrontation that could have delayed the legislation's path through Congress.


  Instead, more than $3 billion would be dedicated to research and development on vaccines, medicines for treatment, and diagnostic tests, including $300 million for the government to purchase such drugs from manufacturers at "fair and reasonable" prices to distribute them to those who need it — which is the standard applied in earlier crises like the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak.


  It also would provide more than $2 billion to help federal, state and local governments prepare for and respond to the coronavirus threat, including $300 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's rapid response fund. Another $1.3 billion would be used to help fight the virus overseas.


  Almost $1 billion would provide medical supplies and other preparedness steps: $350 million to aggressively go after the virus in "hot spots" like Washington state; $500 million to buy drugs, masks and other medical supplies for states, local governments and hospitals; and $100 million for community health centers. It would devote $500 million to Medicare for remote "telehealth" consultations that would permit sick people to get treatment without visiting a doctor.


  "This robust, bipartisan agreement goes far above the President's totally inadequate request to actually meet the needs we are hearing from our states and will help ensure tests and vaccines are available to everyone who needs them," said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.


  The legislation comes as the outbreak in the U.S. appears increasingly likely to affect workers who would be instructed to stay home, immigrants who may fear seeking treatment because they are in the U.S. illegally, and homeless people. Widespread school closures are possible as well.


  "The American people are apprehensive about the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. and abroad. Global financial markets are on edge," said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Appropriations Committee. "Both are resilient, but vigorous action is needed to calm nerves, stabilize the situation, and get our arms around this crisis."


  Vice President Mike Pence, who is coordinating the administration's response, returned to the Capitol Wednesday afternoon to separately brief House Democrats and Republicans, winning praise from both sides.


  "The vice president is trying to be as calming as he can and frankly his comments for the most part ... his comments seem to be pretty well aligned with where we are on this," said Ren Dan Kildee, D-Mich.


  Also Wednesday, top congressional leaders met to discuss what additional steps may be needed to ensure the safety of the Capitol complex — for lawmakers and staff, as well as the annual influx of visitors this spring.


  Afterward, Pelosi said it was a "good, positive meeting about unity, and how we want to protect the Capitol and have continuity of operations for the Congress." Asked whether the Capitol and its visitors center and galleries will remain open, Pelosi said, "Yes, at this time yes."


  Wednesday's developments also included a move by the Department of Health and Human Services to provide and initial $35 million in aid to 28 states and localities to help their public health departments respond to the outbreak and increase their surveillance for the virus.


  Washington state, which has seen 10 deaths, will get $2.75 million, while California will get $4.5 million. The money should be available to the states by early next week, federal officials said, and comes from more than $135 million that HHS Secretary Alex Azar transferred from other department accounts to help with the coronavirus response.

"Does anyone seriously believe that a president, backed by the corporate world is going to bring about the changes in this country that working families and the middle class and low-income people desperately need?" Sanders asked. He often reminds crowds that he does not have, want, or need a Super PAC.He also contrasted their records on health care, trade, entitlements, the bankruptcy bill, and the Iraq War. Sanders used the refrain, "Joe is going to have to explain to the American people …" to highlight the contrasts. Throughout his critique of Biden, Sanders said he did not want his campaign to "degenerate into a Trump type effort where we're attacking each other." He said that he looks forward to a serious debate on the issues. He also told reporters that he had spoken on the phone a few hours earler with Elizabeth Warren, who failed to win any states on Tuesday, including her home state of Massachusetts, where she placed third. "What Senator Warren told me is that she is assessing her campaign," he said. "She has not made any decisions as of this point. And it is important, I think for all of us, certainly me, who known Elizabeth Warren for many, many years, to respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision."Warren's departure from the race would likely help Sanders' standing in the races ahead. He's hoping to do well in Michigan, where he beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Should he win, it would solidify his argument that he can build a coalition of urban and working-class voters. A loss would imply he is losing support, especially after failing to win Minnesota and Massachusetts.

The extent of the damage to the global economy caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19 moved further into focus on Wednesday as UN economists announced a likely 50 billion drop in worldwide manufacturing exports in February alone.In remarks made at a joint press conference with the head of the World Bank Group, the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said that the UN-backed global funds would make up the shortfall, in effect, by offering to inject around 50 billion into low-income and emerging-market nations, pending requests for support.Thanks to the generosity of our shareholders, we have about 1 trillion in overall lending capacity, she said. For low-income countries, we have rapid-disbursing emergency financing of up to 10 billion 50 percent of quota of eligible members that can be accessed without a full-fledged IMF programme.The IMF chief added that members can access emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument. This facility could provide about 40 billion for emerging markets that could potentially approach us for financial support. We also have the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust the CCRT which provides eligible countries with up-front grants for relief on IMF debt service falling due.The CCRT proved to be effective during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, but is now underfunded with just over 200 million available against possible needs of over 1 billion. She called on member countries to help ensure that this facility is fully re- charged and ready for the current crisis, and said that the Fund was fully committed to supporting our member countries, particularly the most vulnerable. We have the tools to help and we are coordinating closely with our partner institutions.UNCTAD breaks down costs of virus so farPreliminary economic data analyzed by the UN Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD in Geneva, indicate that virus containment measures in China where the outbreak emerged in late December have already caused a substantial decline in output.Those worst hits are expected to the European Union 15.5 billion, the United States 5.8 billion and Japan 5.2 billion, said Pamela Coke-Hamilton, who heads UNCTADs Division on International Trade and Commodities.For developing economies that are reliant on selling raw materials, the effects could be felt very, very intensely, she added.Assuming that it is not mitigated in the short-term, its likely that the overall impact on the global economy is going to be significant in terms of a negative downturn.Biggest index drop since 2004Citing the China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index PMI, the UN economist noted that it had fallen to 37.5 - a drop of about 20 points the lowest reading since 2004.This also correlates directly to exports and also implies a two percent drop in overall exports, she said, with a resulting ripple effect worldwide to the tune of a 50 billion fall in exports.Because China has become the main supplier of finished products and so-called intermediate products used in countless industries - from chemical for pharmaceuticals to parts for digital cameras and the car industry - concerns about the long-term disruption to supply chains there, has left many companies around the world fearful that their own output may soon be affected, UNCTAD said.Of course, if the virus continues to spread and gets out of control, and we see closures not only in China but also in India and the United States and everywhere else in the world, then it would be a big problem, said Alessandro Nicita, from UNCTADs Division on International Trade and Commodities.Ultimately, the economic impact of this virus depends on the measures that countries apply to contain the virus. So, China has done a great job of containing the virus, but it has sacrificed a little bit the economy, at least in the first few weeks. So, planned closures, restriction to movement of people, which were all necessary but there is an economic effect when you take those measures.In addition to falling manufacturing levels, UNCTAD also highlighted a decrease in the number of container ships leaving Shanghai in the first half of February from around 300 a week to 180, which then returned to normal levels in the second half of the month. Right now, the impact on the global value chains is already being felt and will continue probably for a few months, Ms. Coke-Hamilton said. But if it rebounds, say in the next few months, then the long-term or year-long impact will be a little different and will be better. So, it depends on what happens in China.Boosting national manufacturing not a quick fixResponding to questions about whether countries might react to a potential supply-chain squeeze by looking to domestic manufacturers instead, the UNCTAD economists explained that such a measure would unlikely be effective in the short-term.China has built a huge logistics - transport logistics - which is like harbors, shipping lanes, airplanes, that actually are able to move all of those goods in and out of China, Mr. Nicita explained. Now yes, some industries may be able to find some sort of alternative suppliers like in Mexico or East Europe, but that will require even more time, because not only production needs to be moved, but also the infrastructure related to logistics would need to be built.Ms. Coke-Hamilton added It was the same argument that was used when the US President thought that imposing certain measures on certain countries would shift production back to the United States. Its never that easy because when companies move and they relocate and they set up their industries and their logistics frameworks, its very hard to shift in the short term.US measures produce knock-on effectHighlighting ongoing uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the epidemic, in which there have been more than 90,000 confirmed cases in more than 70 countries the majority in China and over 3,000 deaths, Ms. Coke- Hamilton said that U.S. measures in terms of visitor arrivals, canceling various meetings were having a knock-on effect in terms of demand.So right now, were not clear on where it will go a lot will depend on what happens with COVID-19 if they are able to come up with a vaccine then hallelujah, hopefully, it will end very quickly but if not, the impact can be severe.Adding tongue-in-cheek that a study on the economic impact of the epidemic on smaller and less globally interconnected countries like her native Jamaica might not have raised the same level of interest from the TV cameras and journalists present, Ms. Coke-Hamilton laughed that we would not be sitting here, simply because the level of integration of production that is reliant on China and on Chinas intermediate outputs is so significant to the national economy and the global value chains that it is important to measure.IMF, World Bank, stand ready to helpMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund IMF and the World Bank Group issued a joint message of solidarity in relation to the ongoing epidemic.The IMF and the World Bank Group stand ready to help our member countries address the human tragedy and economic challenge posed by the COVID-19 virus, they said in a statement.We have engaged actively with international institutions and country authorities, with special attention to poor countries where health systems are the weakest and people are most vulnerable.Available measures included emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance, the institutions explained, underlining the need to help countries to invest in protecting themselves.The strengthening of country health surveillance and response systems is crucial to contain the spread of this and any future outbreaks, the statement said.

SEATTLE (AP) — The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 11 on Wednesday with a patient succumbing in California — the first reported fatality outside Washington state — as federal authorities announced an investigation of the Seattle-area nursing home where most of the victims were stricken.


  Officials in California's Placer County, near Sacramento, said an elderly person who tested positive after returning from a San Francisco-to-Mexico cruise had died. The victim had underlying health problems, authorities said.


  California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency. Washington and Florida had already declared emergencies.


  Washington also announced another death, bringing its total to 10. Most of those who died were residents of Life Care Center, a nursing home in Kirkland, a suburb east of Seattle. At least 39 cases have been reported in the Seattle area, where researchers say the virus may have been circulating undetected for weeks.


  Seema Verma, head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the agency is sending inspectors to Life Care along with experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out what happened and determine whether the nursing home followed guidelines for preventing infections.


  Last April, the state fined Life Care $67,000 over infection-control deficiencies following two flu outbreaks that affected 17 patients and staff. An unannounced follow-up inspection in June determined that Life Care had corrected the problems, Verma said.


  Meanwhile, public officials in Washington came under pressure to take more aggressive steps against the outbreak, including closing schools and canceling large events. While the state and Seattle have declared emergencies, giving leaders broad powers to suspend activities, they have not issued any orders to do so.


  “We have encouraged people who are responsible for large gatherings to give consideration whether it really makes sense to carry those on right now,” Gov. Jay Inslee said. “Right now, we are deferring to the judgment ... of these organizations.”


  While some individual schools and businesses have shut down, the governor said large-scale school closings have not been ordered because “there are so many ramifications for families and businesses,” especially for health care workers who might not be able to go to work because of child care responsibilities.


  Local and state health officials have not recommended school closings unless the schools have had a confirmed case of the disease.


  Jennifer Hayles, 41, of Kirkland said she was appalled that Inslee and health officials haven't canceled next week's Emerald City Comic Con. The four-day cosplay and pop-culture event draws close to 100,000 people each year, and some participants, including D.C. Comics and Penguin Random House, have pulled out over the virus.


  Hayles said she spent hundreds of dollars on tickets and other items related to the event but will have to skip it because she has a compromised immune system.


  “There’s a lot of people who are talking about the economic cost of people forced to pull out of Comic Con, but if we have an explosion of cases of coronavirus, the economic cost is going to be much higher,” Hayles said.


  Comic Con's organizer, Reedpop, announced Wednesday that it would make an exception to its no-refunds policy for those who want their money back, but said it remained committed to holding the event unless local, state or federal officials change their guidance.


  Lakshmi Unni said that she was keeping her son, an eighth-grader at Redmond Middle School in Seattle's eastern suburbs, home on Wednesday and that she had urged the school board and principal to close.


  “Yesterday at least three kids were coughing,” Unni said. “We don’t know if they were sick with the virus, but if they do become sick, the chances of spreading are very, very high.”


  Some schools, businesses and other employers aren't waiting.


  Seattle and King County public health officials urged businesses to allow employees to work remotely if possible, and the county said it will allow telecommuting for some of its workers for the next three weeks.


  Microsoft said it has asked its Seattle-area workers who can do their jobs at home to work from home until March 25. The directive also affects Microsoft employees in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Redmond, Washington-based company said employees should still come in if they work at a data center, retail store or other location where their presence is needed, unless they have an underlying health condition, are over 60 or fall into other categories that health authorities say pose higher risks.


  Microsoft is also asking people to cancel travel to its Puget Sound and Bay Area campuses unless it is "essential for the continuity of Microsoft." The company is also canceling non-essential business travel to other regions where the virus is active.


  The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle announced it is canceling events at the complex and requiring nonessential staff to work remotely at least through the end of the month to lessen the chance of infection among patients with weakened immune systems.


  School officials in Renton, south of Seattle, announced that Hazen High School will close for the rest of the week after a student tested positive for the coronavirus. Online petitions urged officials to close other schools on Seattle's east side.


  The F5 technology company closed its 44-story tower in downtown Seattle after learning an employee had been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus. Outdoor recreation giant REI shut down its Seattle-area operations for two days as a precaution.


  A federal immigration field office near Tukwila also closed after an employee visited the Kirkland nursing home. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the move was a precaution and the place will remain shut for 14 days.


  Health officials in North Carolina reported that a person from Wake County tested positive for the illness after visiting the nursing home. The patient's flight from the Seattle area to the Raleigh-Durham airport raised fears other passengers were exposed to the virus.


  "My understanding is we have the manifest. Now the trick is to go find them,” said Robert Redfield of the CDC.


  Life Care Center said on its website that it is screening employees for symptoms before they start work and as they leave. The nursing home is prohibiting visits from residents' family members.


  Shortly before the California death was announced, Princess Cruise Lines notified passengers of its Grand Princess that federal health officials are investigating a "small cluster” of coronavirus cases connected to the ship's mid-February voyage. It asked current passengers to stay in their cabins until cleared by medical staff and said those who had been on the previous voyage should contact their doctor if they develop fever or other symptoms.


  The Grand Princess is at sea off Mexico and will return early to San Francisco, where CDC and company officials will meet to determine the course of action, the cruise line said.


  In Los Angeles, a contract medical worker who was conducting screenings at the city's main airport has tested positive for the virus. The person wore protective equipment while on the job so it was unclear how the worker contracted the virus, Homeland Security officials said.


  In New York, health officials put hundreds of residents in self-quarantine after members of two families in the New York City suburb of New Rochelle were diagnosed with the virus. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the disease appeared to have spread from a lawyer to his wife, two children, a neighbor and two others.


  The new results brought the number of confirmed cases in the state to 11.

Daniel Ricciardo will be keeping a close eye on his mobile phone this season as the Australians Formula One future comes into focus.At the moment, the 30-year-old is committed to the Renault project he signed up for in 2018, but both he and the French manufacturer team will be starting a big year in Melbourne on March 15. Renault must really start to realise their potential while Ricciardo, out of contract at the end of the year, needs to keep himself in the shop window should the likes of Ferrari or Mercedes come calling.Everyone knows how this sport works. If another team calls, Im not going to block the call or anything. Ill answer it and listen to what they have to say, Ricciardo told Reuters at pre-season testing in Spain. What Renault also need to know, and fully trust that I mean it, is that I am still here 100 a Renault driver and right now I have no intention of leaving, he added.I want this to work. I dont even want to think if it doesnt work then Ill figure out something else. I really just want to have the narrative now of were going to try to find a way to make this work. Ferrari have Charles Leclerc signed up to the end of 2024, while Red Bull have Max Verstappen under contract for the next four years, and six-times champion Lewis Hamilton is expected to commit to staying at Mercedes.That leaves, however, potential vacancies in the second driver slots. Charles and Max having early signings it does kind of narrow the speculation. I guess Lewis is the next one. And then theres me, said Ricciardo.I feel like the RicciardoRed Bull stuff just happened so I guess we could be in a similar position with the media and all that in the next few months. I went through a pretty hectic one moving from Red Bull so I think whatever happens it will be less wild.POINT TO PROVE Ricciardo won seven races with Red Bull, with three pole positions, before stunning the team -- after months of deliberation -- by deciding to join former engine partners Renault.Renault, who had finished fourth in 2018, dropped to fifth behind McLaren last year with Ricciardos best result a fourth place at Monza. This year he said there was a fresh optimism around the factory and he felt more established.Theres a lot on the line for me, I still obviously want to make this work and try and prove it to myself and a lot of others, he said. Also, the team have a point to prove and they feel theyve got to deliver something better for me. We both have a job to be done.The Australian, who has a holiday home in Los Angeles but recently bought a place in Monaco after years of renting, has become famed for his broad smile, prank- loving character and relaxed disposition. He said, however, that there was another less evident Ricciardo.There is a competitor in me which, Ill be honest not even my trainer Michael knows, he said. I think theres something extra in me. I think some things I do keep to myself also for the pride of knowing thats just something Ill always know deep within me and I dont need to share. Or share 99 but not the full 100.To put it bluntly, I really want this. As much as I have fun and joke and have other interests in life, this means more than anything to me. I know that when push comes to shove Im willing to go all the way.

The win evened Seguin’s district record at 1-1, and lifted the team to 2-3 overall.


  “The bats came alive,” head coach Dusty Brittain said. “I told the guys that it wasn’t like they threw any slouch out there, those guys are quality arms. I don’t know how many total hits we had, but we came through with some two-out hits and some big RBIs.”


  Seguin collected 11 hits on the night, breaking through in the bottom of the third inning to take a 6-0 lead.


  With the Mats up 1-0, Michael Hernandez reached on a hard hit ball to third base that was thrown wide of the bag at first, and Hernandez took second on the error.


  Drew Burnett got the Mats’ first big hit of the game on the next at bat.


  Burnett turned on a fast ball and cranked it out of the ball park over the right centerfield fence to put Seguin up 3-0.


  “Drew got some big hits, including the bomb,” Brittain said.


  But the Mats weren’t done in the inning. After Cory Mazzurana was hit by a pitch and Chase Boenig reached on an error, Marques Washington, pinch running for Mazzurana, scored on a Stephen Kent single and Boenig scored to put the Mats up by five, 5-0.


  Kent advanced to second on a wild pitch and moved to third on a ground out to second by Martin Rivera. Kent scored on an errant throw to first that got him home for the 6-0 lead.

In the event that a boy or girl catches coronavirus, parents are advised not to overplay any risk to their health.


  "You could tell them it's 'a bit like feeling sore', so they get to see it's not as dreadful as they might believe," Jon Gilmartin, a speech language therapist at the children's communication charity I Can, says.


  Older people and those with existing health conditions are thought to be most at risk of death or serious sickness from catching coronavirus. This could lead children to worry about older friends and relatives.


  Dr Rudkin advises honesty over the argument "we will all die eventually but chances are not until we are really, really old".


  ## Use simple language


  "But we can talk about it with a smile and use humour, or at least a lightness of touch, that doesn't then plummet our children into an existential pit they really don't need to be in, until they're 13 at least," she adds. "Reassure your child that you and granddad are really fit and strong and that you will continue to do all you can to keep yourself/granddad healthy and safe."


  Children's capacity to deal with complex and worrying information increases with age, so the way a parent speaks to a three-year-old is very different to dealing with a teenager - and it involves a personal judgement.


  But Mr Gilmartin suggests the use of "simple language" for all age groups and allowing children to ask "lots of questions" to show they're being listened to.


  Parents who themselves are looking for the right language to use, could start with the BBC's Newsround coverage.


  Children, like the rest of the population, are exposed to myths and misinformation about coronavirus, via playground gossip and, particularly among pre-teens and teenagers, on social media.


  The best way to combat this is providing "age-appropriate information and reassurance", says Dr Rudkin, as the source young people trust best is a parent.

For weeks after President Trump's inauguration in 2017, Richard Cordray waited to be fired.


  The then-director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had long been a target of Republicans frustrated by the power wielded by the new agency - a brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. - including the limits on the president's ability to fire him.


  The possibility that Trump would test those constraints and immediately move to fire Cordray "loomed over everything," according to Cordray's book "Watchdog," which will be published Monday.


  Cordray says he hired an attorney and prepared for a fight to keep his job. But instead of a dismissal notice, he received an invitation from Gary Cohn, the then head of the National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs executive, to meet for dinner at Trump's new D.C. hotel. Cohen had been tasked with deciding his fate but didn't want a big fight, Cohn told him. They settled on a temporary truce that left Cordray in place for nearly a year.


  The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday in a case that could determine once and for all whether a president can fire the CFPB director "at will." The ruling could shape the future of the 1,600-person bureau and throw into question the legitimacy of the billions in fines it has imposed on mortgage lenders, credit-card companies and banks over the last eight years.


  The court will be hearing the case of a California law firm, Seila Law, which has refused to cooperate with a CFPB investigation, arguing the bureau's leadership structure is unconstitutional.


  "It is an important test of what level of independence executive agencies can have in the latest version of the Roberts court," Christopher L. Peterson, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and a former CFPB official, said of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.


  A 2007 paper by Warren, written when she was a Harvard law professor, was the guiding force behind what became the CFPB in the wake of the global financial crisis. But the bureau was controversial from the start with Republicans calling for changes to its structure: it should be run by a five-member commission rather than a single director, they argued; and be funded through Congress rather than the Federal Reserve, giving lawmakers more oversight powers.


  Warren, Obama's first choice to be the bureau's first director, rejected the idea of legislative compromise, according to "Watchdog." Warren said "her first choice was a strong consumer agency, her second choice was 'no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.' "


  Cordray's book is largely a love letter to an agency he helped establish, he was one of the first 12 employees, but also gives new insight into some of its most controversial moments.


  Wells Fargo, the embattled San Francisco bank, initially tried to "stonewall" an investigation launched by the Los Angeles city attorney into whether its employees were improperly opening accounts customers didn't want, according to "Watchdog." Wells Fargo tried to "tie [the city] up in protracted discovery, which is a classic defense strategy in difficult cases."


  The bank's resistance crumbled as the CFPB, which has broader powers, intervened, and Wells Fargo agreed to settle, Cordray says. But the bank wanted to keep many key details from public view, including that more than 5,000 employees had been fired for opening millions of accounts customers didn't want. "The bank fought hard to control the spin and minimize the issue, suggesting that the number of problem accounts was only about 1% of its total accounts," Cordray writes.


  The bank didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.


  He also has few kind words for his successor, Mick Mulvaney, who Trump appointed acting director when Cordray stepped down in November 2017 and launched a failed bid for Ohio governor. Mulvaney, who as a South Carolina lawmaker called the CFPB a "joke" and co-sponsored legislation to get rid of it, levied fewer and smaller fines, dropped lawsuits against payday lenders and softened proposed regulations for debt collectors while acting director.

TOKYO - Asian shares rose Thursday, taking their cue from a surge on Wall Street as governments and central banks took more aggressive measures to fight the virus outbreak and its effects on the economy.
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.8% in early trading to 21,264.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.9% to 6,381.50. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.6% to 2,071.99. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.5% at 26,339.33, while the Shanghai Composite was also up 0.5% at 3,025.23. Shares were also higher in southeast Asia.
 The gains on Wall Street more than recouped big losses from a day earlier as wild, virus-fueled swings around the world's markets extend into a third week.
 Stocks rose sharply from the get-go, led by big gains for health care stocks after Joe Biden solidified his contender status for the Democratic presidential nomination. Investors see him as a more business-friendly alternative to Bernie Sanders.
 The rally's momentum accelerated around midday after House and Senate leadership reached a deal on a bipartisan $8.3 billion bill to battle the coronavirus outbreak. The measure's funds would go toward research into a vaccine, improved tests and drugs to treat infected people.
 Investors are also anticipating other central banks will follow up on the Federal Reserve’s surprise move Tuesday to slash interest rates by half a percentage point in hopes of protecting the economy from the economic fallout of the new coronavirus. Canada's central bank cut rates on Wednesday, also by half a percentage point and citing the virus' effect.
 “The fact that you get an $8 billion bill, that's money that will be spent, hopefully, on something that really will have an impact on mitigating the effects on the economy,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments.
 Some measures of fear in the market eased. Treasury yields rose but were still near record lows in a sign that the bond market remains concerned about the economic pain possible from the fast-spreading virus. Companies around the world are already saying the virus is sapping away earnings due to supply chain disruptions and weaker sales, with General Electric becoming the latest to warn its investors.
 Even though many investors say they know lower interest rates will not halt the spread of the virus, they want to see central banks and other authorities do what they can to lessen the damage. The S&P 500 sank 2.8% on Tuesday after a brief relief rally triggered by the Fed’s rate cut fizzled.
 “Monetary policy can only take us so far, but at least it’s a step,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. "Investors will take comfort in co-ordinated central bank action. I take comfort in knowing this isn’t the plague, we’ll eventually get through this.”
 The Bank of England has a meeting on March 26 on interest rates. The European Central Bank and others have already cut rates below zero, meanwhile, which limits their monetary policy firepower. But economists say they could make other moves, such as freeing up banks to lend more.
 An indicator of fear in the market, which measures how much traders are paying to protect themselves from future swings for the S&P 500, sank 14.1%.
 Health care stocks in the S&P 500 jumped 5.8% for the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the index. UnitedHealth Group jumped 10.7%, Cigna climbed 10.7%. and Anthem soared 15.6%, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500.
 A Biden nomination would be more welcome on Wall Street than a nod for Sanders, who is campaigning on a proposal to enact “Medicare For All.”

The Argentinian's 53rd-minute strike proved the difference as Pep Guardiola's side made it five successive wins in all competitions, matching its best run of victories in 2019-2020.
 Defenders Nicolas Otamendi and Benjamin Mendy struck the woodwork either side of half-time before Championship side Wednesday's resistance was eventually broken.
 Goalkeeper Joe Wildsmith got a hand to Aguero's strike but could not prevent the ball going over the line as City's all-time leading scorer registered his 254th goal for the club.
 Gabriel Jesus and Aguero were both in the City starting line-up and the former headed a 20th-minute chance wide from a John Stones cross.
 Aguero spotted his fellow forward's run seven minutes later but the Brazilian failed to get a good connection on a stretching volley when free six yards out.
 Otamendi nodded against the crossbar from a free-kick delivered by Riyad Mahrez, who also picked out Stones from a set-piece only for the defender to miss the target when his downward header hit the ground and bounced over the top.
 There was a greater impetus from City after the break, though, as Mendy's first-time effort cannoned off the frame of the goal in a sign Guardiola's half-time words had worked.
 Wednesday did not heed the warning, with Aguero left in enough space in the box to collect Mendy's pass, turn and fire a shot which looped off Wildsmith's left arm and went in.
 Replays showed it was a close call over whether Aguero was onside or had strayed beyond last man Dominic Iorfa, though the absence of VAR at Wednesday's ground meant there was no closer inspection.
 Wildsmith did redeem himself somewhat by thwarting Stones, Rodri and substitute Raheem Sterling with his legs, while another more conventional save with his hands denied Mahrez.
 However, Wednesday failed to register a shot on target across the piece and mustered their only effort overall in the sixth minute as Aguero's strike proved enough to send City into the last eight.

CHELSEA -- Onsted's girls basketball team lived up to one of the team's motto's Wednesday night.
 "We have a saying in our program," said Wildcats' coach Brandon Arnold. "It's not who we play, its how we play. Tonight, we didn't play the way we can play."
 The result was a 56-44 loss to Eaton Rapids in the Division 2 District semifinal at Chelsea.
 The Wildcats fell behind early but trailed 16-13 after the first quarter. But, scoring only five points in the second quarter was too much to overcome. Eaton Rapids went up 27-18 at halftime.
 "We just weren't patient on offense," Arnold said. "We were a little over anxious, forced up shots or turned it over. It just was an off night. We picked the wrong night to have a bad night."
 Onsted closed the gap late in the game, getting it to a five-point game at one point. Kaylei Smith nailed a pair of triples in the fourth quarter in trying to bring the Wildcats back. She fished with 12 points.
 Eaton Rapids pulled away with a couple late buckets when they broke the Onsted press and hit four free throws down the stretch.
 "It was pretty even, just a bad second quarter," Arnold said.
 Mya Hiram had another double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds. She was 7-for-8 from the free throw line.
 The setback ends the Wildcat season at 13-8. Six of those losses came to Columbia Central (20-2), Ida (19-3) and Erie Mason (15-6). Onsted won its first three games of the season, then fell victim to the injury bug. At one point, Hiram, normally a post player, had to play point guard because the Wildcats' top two-point guards were out with injuries.
 "In five or six of our losses, every single one of them, we had a lead, sometimes in the fourth quarter," Arnold said. "We were in every game we lost. Sometimes it was just a little thing here or there and we lost. We were a few points from being 15-5 or 16-4."
 It was the final game for seniors Miranda and Madison Wright, McKenna Russell and Brooklyn Kurowski. Of those four, only Kurowski was a starter, meaning the Wildcats have plenty to build around for next year, including Kayla Ross who averaged 12 points a game and Hiram, a Ferris State University commit.
 "We'll be alright," Arnold. "We'll have two four-year players and a little more mature. Hopefully our younger girls learned some things this season."

“ Study history, study history. In history lie all the secrets of statecraft.” I have used these words of Winston Churchill many times in the social studies classrooms, but as an educator it has always been very difficult to focus on the importance of history in a society dominated by the natural sciences and technology. The natural sciences have remained the “source of income”, the "bread and butter" subjects which will make it possible for the learners to gain financially from the world of work. Against this background, questions, such as the following, and focusing on a subject like history in our schools, arise. Often questions are asked - Is there still a place for the social sciences in our classrooms? If yes, then what is the possible value of History in a society driven by financial forces and technological developments? Can technology be utilised to convey the importance of History? In my opinion, even though contemporary society is dominated by the demand for science and technology, the role and place of social sciences must not be underplayed, as they have an important role in shaping and moulding people and the societies in which they live. The question remains, however, to what extent History is still a relevant and important subject at school level and how technology, which is a way of life for the present generation can make history more important and relevant in today’s world. First, talking about history as a subject, I acknowledge that it helps to build the capacity to make informed choices in order to contribute constructively to society and to advance democracy. It enhances personal empowerment, it promotes an understanding of human agency; it develops knowledge that, as humans, we have choices to change the world for the better. Through the rigorous process of historical enquiry, we are taught to think critically about society and to support democracy as a vehicle for human rights. Subsequently, the fact is highlighted that, because of the media- dominated culture in which we live, many educators recognise that many of our students' ideas about the past are constructed not through the written words of textbooks but through the historically themed film and television programmes that they watch. Many Indians are learning more of their past and their history through the media. Recent films like Tanhaji, Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, and numerous world class war documentaries made by film makers all over the world are testimony to it. It is not just the written word that contributes to understanding the past and the trends of bygone eras, but films and television could also contribute to this process of learning history in our classrooms. Many living-room discussions are stimulated by the media and people have started talking about their history and heritage as never before. The history teacher has to take cognizance of this phenomenon and accommodate films and documentaries effectively in his/ her curriculum and demonstrate less dependence on the textbooks to achieve more respect and approval of the history subject. The use of films should not be regarded as a simple matter, as history also demands some awareness of theory and a recognition of the need to understand a film or television programme as one part of a much larger, complex and ever-changing culture. Today's classroom is less than ever isolated from the cultural environment and one cannot ignore the pervasiveness and intrusion of electronic media. Educators have to acknowledge film and television as the great history educators of our time. Films and documentaries are fun, and it can involve learners in history and increase their enjoyment of the subject. Film is unmatched in its capacity to provide emphatic reconstruction to convey how historical people witnessed, understood and lived their lives. Use of mass media and technology has become common in many classrooms today to teach history. The importance of using films correctly as it can contribute to developing learners' creativity and their imagination cannot be ignored. How history helps learners to get an insight and understanding of the revolutions and movements of history, the stories of people, of their successes and accomplishments, how it helps learners to understand the movements and rebellions in time, and how the popularity of film can contribute to a greater interest in history are some of the significant and pertinent issues that educators should be equipped to deal with. Students in the history classrooms should not simply watch a film, but 'read' it as a text". The challenge for the teachers will be to guide learners so that they understand that the visuals shown in the films are not misrepresented or twisted but positively formed and shaped. One should develop visual literacy, as media is also literature - the only difference is that the filmmaker writes with his camera as a writer writes with his pen. The goal of history teaching must go beyond simply informing people, chronicling events or passing on the traditions of a culture to new generations, to giving people the wherewithal to think out important issues. It should be, therefore, a given that we teach our students to use audiovisual sources as stimuli to think. Moving images that students see must not be uncritically accepted, but they should be examined and assessed within a particular context and all history classes should be lessons in critical thinking based on a visual stimulus. Films and Television have a large role to play in this regard. From the line of reasoning it is perhaps clear that the use of media and technology pose complex and interesting challenges to achieve the goals of History learning in school classrooms. The creative and responsible use of media and technology can contribute towards the development of values and goals like making informed decisions based on a study of the past, helping learners to study the past so that they have a better understanding of the present and where they come from, having a clearer self-understanding of their existence and their co-existence with others in specific contexts, and helping learners to develop a historical consciousness through the development of visual literacy. A society dominated by science and technology does not necessarily have to result in negative implications for the role and place of the teaching of History. In fact, Media and Technology can be utilised to contribute to a more compelling and purposeful understanding of the past so that today's learners in our classrooms can make a positive contribution to their own destiny and the future of society.

It's March, it's spring, nature is reborn and I dream beautifully about the rebirth of Romania, and in this process there's no way that we shouldn't rely on an entrepreneurial wave which, I feel, is whipped up by women," said Ludovic Orban.

"If we look at sports or cultural performance, at many economic performances lately, we see that we have a strong point here that must be capitalised upon and must be stimulated.

Conformism, submission, yielding to authority, learning by heart, the exclusive encouragement of memorization and reproduction must be replaced by a new vision of encouraging initiative, creativity, associativity, strong characters and spirits, capable of urging action, of rewarding someone when they have the courage to do something new and good, with positive effects," Orban stressed.      The acting PM expressed confidence that Romania has "an enormous chance", given that it has "talented people", capable of being competitive.      "We have people who succeed when they get hired abroad, although they start from the bottom, who are asked to stay with the companies they work for. (...) This is why a change in administration is needed, a change in policy, a change in the vision of development drivers is required, and this development can only be based on initiative, entrepreneurship, creativity, innovation, development, on supporting all those who really want to take risks (...) and who have the ability to generate competitive business in any field of activity. I am relying on this beautiful, elegant wave spawned in this hall and maybe in every family with girls who will choose the path of initiative, business and success in life in their own right," Orban told the audience.

"We took that idea, and we flipped it," Gordon's energy policy advisor Randall Luthi said. HB-200 would require utilities to produce a portion of their electricity from low-carbon sources. The bill targets one source: Coal plants with carbon capture.
 Utility companies aren't leaping to install carbon capture in coal plants on their own. "While they appear willing to invest millions and millions in wind and solar, they don't appear to have the same appetite to invest anything in carbon capture," Luthi told WyoFile. "We thought maybe it's because there's not a carrot and stick approach like was used in renewables to make them want to," he said.
 To incentivize carbon capture projects in coal plants, the bill would allow electrical utility companies to seek reimbursement for those investments through the Wyoming Public Service Commission, which regulates utility rates. The PSC is charged with maintaining affordable and reliable electrical power.
 That investment recuperation is the carrot. The stick Luthi mentioned is a section of the bill that would prevent a utility company from similarly recuperating its investments in new electricity generation — wind, solar or even natural gas — that replaces coal plants until the company has satisfied the new mandate.
 Utility company Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of PacifiCorp, has drawn ire from state politicians since it plans to retire some Wyoming coal-fired power plants early. The company is building wind farms in Wyoming to replace some of that coal power.
 Gordon promoted the idea behind the bill in his state-of-the-state speech to lawmakers at the beginning of the session. He also appeared in front of the House Revenue Committee on Feb. 19 to help push the legislation through that committee.
 On the House floor, votes against the bill came from Democrats and the House's most conservative faction — both political constituencies argued the bill could cost Wyoming ratepayers and violates free market principles. The House's lone independent, Rep. Jim Roscoe (I-Wilson), also voted against the bill.
 "We're not really paying attention to the national economy or the world economy," Roscoe told WyoFile. "I don't understand why the coal industry hasn't done this themselves. I do believe there's room for some research, but I don't think we should be the only ones doing it."
 Bill proponents believe there is still a need for coal plants with carbon capture technology, even as utility regulators and legislatures in other states pass mandates for carbon-free power. Many of those states have mapped out ways to derive 80% of their electricity from renewable sources, Jason Begger with the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority told the House Revenue Committee. But to reach 100% low-carbon sourcing, they'll need carbon capture, he argued.
 "That's sort of the dirty little secret," he said. Begger, whose agency has pushed carbon capture projects for years, is one of a number of people who came up with HB-200, according to Luthi.
 The Gordon administration is "trying to extend the life of coal in Wyoming," Luthi said. "The trajectory for coal is likely to keep going down, we recognize that. I don't see that changing, but I think there's a way to extend it out as long as possible as [energy] transitions are made."
 The bill initially included a $1 billion cap for investment recovery on carbon capture. That large number sparked public concern in newspaper letters to the editor and messages sent to lawmakers.
 The $1 billion figure was an estimate with no concrete basis in what a carbon capture project might cost, Luthi told WyoFile.
 A legislative committee replaced the $1 billion figure with a percentage cap. Under the bill passed by the House, utility companies could only increase ratepayer cost by up to 2% to recoup their investments in carbon capture technologies.
 Opponents of the bill, however, continue to worry. The PSC will have a hard time preventing a utility company from recouping its full investment through rates, they argued.
 "Regulators cannot force utilities to comply with regulatory mandates and then prevent utilities from recovering their compliance costs," Joshua Macey, a visiting professor at Cornell Law School who studies utility law, wrote in comments to legislators that he provided to reporters.

Although Long Shot probably won’t be remembered as the most iconic Serkis role, it’s definitely one worth checking out.

Cristiano Ronaldo was back training with Juventus' squad on Wednesday, a day after he had returned to Portugal to be with his mother following reports she suffered a stroke.
 The Bianconeri trained in the morning having seen their Coppa Italia semi- final second leg against Milan in Turin - which was scheduled to take place on Wednesday - postponed due to fears over the spread of the coronavirus.
 Among the group that took part in the session was Portuguese forward Ronaldo, who just a day earlier had returned to his homeland to visit his mother, Maria, in hospital.
 Ronaldo, who Maurizio Sarri revealed would have been a doubt to face Milan, said on Twitter on Tuesday that his mother was "currently stable and recovering in hospital".
 Juve are due to face Bologna on Sunday but there remains uncertainty over the Italian football calendar after a scheduled Lega Serie A Emergency Assembly failed to go ahead on Wednesday.
 Just nine top-flight clubs had officials in attendance, with 14 needed for it to be considered an Assembly.
 Reports suggested that those who did meet decided the favoured approach is to play forthcoming fixtures behind closed doors.
 A report from Italian news agency ANSA indicated the government is to impose a ban on sporting events for 30 days, although football matches may still take place without fans attending.
 Following a separate meeting among officials, Italian sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora told reporters the government is leaning towards "this type of measure".

Casper moved into the quarterfinals with a big 94-81 win over Laramie County Community College where they led 53-38 at halftime.
 WNCC’s depth might be something to worry about, but for the seven players on the team, it is nothing to worry about. The Cougars won the 2001 Region IX tournament with just seven players and that tournament was on the NJC court.
 That 2001 team that won regionals won regional title, the schools 7th title, after an up and down year too. The players on the 2001 team included Pawel Mrozik, Derek Cummings, Deonte Moses, Barry Lindsey, Tomislav Topic, Justino Victoriano, and Terrance Allen.
 So, anything is possible for this Cougar team.
 “We definitely are capable of it,” Allen said. “I believe we all know that. It will just take a team effort. We have to play well and nobody can have no dub games. We have to come to play well.”
 The Cougars feature the nation’s leading scorer in Allen, who is committed to the University of Nebraska. Allen is scoring at a 30.7 point clip. Allen has scored in double figures in every game he has played except one and that was an 8-point performance against North Platte on Feb. 4.
 Allen has hit 30 or more points in 15 games this season. Allen has scored 798 points this season, which is the second most points scored in a season, passing Jervay Green, who scored 755 a year ago. The record is 1,033 points scored by Eric Gore in the 1989-90 season.
 Allen, though, has not only been scoring, but also contributing in other factors on the court like rebounding and assists. Allen is averaging 3.6 assists a game, which leads the team, and is pulling down 7.2 rebounds, which also leads the team.
 When he is not scoring, he is finding his teammates and there is plenty of offensive weapons on the team. Kenny Strawbridge is averaging 14.8 points a contest followed by Kalen Williams at 13.1, Jarred Rosser at 9.5, and Elie Cadet and Tayler Johnson each at eight points a game.
 Casper matches up pretty even with the Cougars. The T-Birds have four players in double figures, led by David Walker at 21.5. The other three include Jalen Harris at 16.0, Philip Pepple at 12.1, and Isaiah Banks at 10.1.
 A win on Tuesday against Casper, who won the Region IX title a year ago, would pit the Cougars against the winner of the NJC and Central Wyoming game on Friday.
 Allen and the team want to bring a regional title back to the fans of Scottsbluff and it would be pretty special to do that.
 “With everything we have been through this year, it would mean everything,” Allen said. “We are really coming together as a team. We don’t want it to be over. It would be a big thing if we were able to pull it out with seven players and all the ups and down, and to just get it done. It would be pretty special.”

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Community college faculty, staff and students are asking for the attention of lawmakers. They say they need more funding if they’re going to keep the system running at its current level.Community college faculty and staff say it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with the demands after having no funding increases and some cuts in the last decade.“With a $4.86 return on every dollar spent on community colleges and with only seven percent of the educational budget being set aside for community colleges, I believe it’s not only fiscally responsible to invest in community colleges, I believe it’s fiscally irresponsible not to,” said David Collum, Pearl River Community College Career Education Department Chair.Mississippi Community College students are bucking the brain drain trend with 75 percent of them staying and working in the state after graduation. Among them, is recent Pearl River Community College grad Michael Evans.“I’m 21-years-old with a two year technical degree, using skills that I enjoy at a job that I enjoy and I’m making more money than I ever thought I’d see at this age," explained Evans. "And I have zero college debt.”Gov. Tate Reeves called for raising professor pay across the board at community colleges during his campaign for governor. He notes that as the state asks more of the community college system with workforce training, it adds to that need for increased pay.“We actually have to have instructors that can train them in such a way that they can be successful in life," noted Governor Reeves. "To get those instructors, we have to, for the most part, hire them not from other educational institutions but from the private sector.”The faculty association is asking for lawmakers to provide enough funding to bring salaries to at least the mid-point between K-12 teacher and university professors.Copyright 2020 WLBT.
