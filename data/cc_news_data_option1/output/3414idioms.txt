Never has the NFL doubted it would open its season on time. For months, it has steadfastly stuck to its plans, even as the coronavirus pandemic has altered the course of every other sport — on all levels.
 With its kickoff game of Super Bowl champion Kansas City hosting Houston rapidly approaching, possibly with fans in the stands, America’s most popular sport must recognize the challenges off the field could be more daunting than those on it. Particularly after 77 false positive COVID-19 tests last weekend.
 “We’re going to have to be flexible and adaptable,” says Dr. Allen Sills, the league’s chief medical officer and, in 2020, for good reason, its most visible executive. “I think that’s something we’ll continue to track and monitor.

On court, it was lonely.
 "You can hear yourself breathe," said Kristina Mladenovic, a four-time Grand Slam doubles champion from France. "But this is better than nothing -- than being home on the couch."
 After winning the first sanctioned ATP men's match since March at the Western & Southern Open, Felix Auger-Aliassime jokingly sent a ball toward his coach in the stands, the way players will offer a souvenir to spectators.
 "To have nobody, to have no crowd, it feels weird," said Auger-Aliassime, a Canadian seeded 15th for the U.S. Open. "I'm not a fan of it."
 In team sports in empty arenas, such as Major League Baseball or the NBA, someone wearing the same uniform can offer a pat on the back or words of encouragement.
 In tennis, players are on their own out there. No teammates and no coach standing right there on the sideline to suggest a quick adjustment or draw up a play.
 "Tennis is such a mental sport, and I guess it makes it way more difficult without fans, because I just imagine playing in the fifth set on Arthur Ashe, night session, way past midnight -- and in a normal year, you get so much energy from the fans. They give you so much, all this atmosphere," said Dominic Thiem, an Austrian seeded No. 2 in New York behind Novak Djokovic and a three-time runner-up at Grand Slam tournaments.
 "And now, in an empty stadium, maybe your coach and your team is there. These are the only people," Thiem said. "That makes it, I guess, very, very lonely. Very, very tough. And that's going to be a very interesting thing to experience."
 It'll be particularly unusual at Flushing Meadows, famous for its boisterous crowds who tend to make much more noise than their counterparts at the All England Club or Roland Garros, say.
 Especially during the New York night sessions, where the socializing and imbibing take things to a whole other level.
 "There's a hush when you walk out on Centre Court at Wimbledon. When you walk out at the U.S. Open, there's an explosion," said Chris Evert, who won six of her 18 Grand Slam singles titles in New York.
 "It's going to be challenging, mentally, for the players. The ones that can focus, compartmentalize -- just manage to remember that they are playing a Grand Slam and the importance of it -- will handle it a little bit easier than those that are a little all over the place," Evert said. "Either way, hopefully it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing."

Many would say playing a collision sport not only is hazardous but foolhardy. The NFL did have 67 players opt out of the season. But it seems the vast majority of players, coaches, executives and, for certain, owners, want to stick to the script. Even with the risk COVID-19 presents.
 “I just really thought about all the things that could happen,” says Broncos star linebacker Von Miller, who has recovered from the coronavirus. “This season is different from any other season. I weighed the positives and the negatives, and I came to my own decision that I can play. I thought about me having asthma. I went over everything that I possibly could with my agent, and we just thought about it.
 “I feel like every player should do that. Every player should think about everything they could do.”
 The NFL believes it has thought of everything it can do to provide the safest environment for its games. Still, some clubs are planning to open the gates to fans, with the Dolphins announcing plans for about 13,000 folks in the stands on Sept. 20.
 Yes, there are competitive imbalance issues there, but if one municipality allows fans and another doesn’t, is it up to the league to step in?
 “It’s very hard,” Vikings coach Mike Zimmer says. “Some stadiums, they’re allowing people in, and it looks like we’re not going to have any fans there early, which really stinks because we have such unbelievable fans, and they make that place rocking every Sunday. But the best way to have home-field advantage is to play really good: execute, make tackles, don’t make mistakes, don’t commit penalties, turnovers, all those things.”
 Some teams have huge advantages heading into a season like no other, with or without anyone in the seats.
 STABILITY
 Looking for clubs with a distinct edge when the 16-game (maybe) season kicks off? Try New Orleans, Kansas City, San Francisco, Buffalo, Baltimore and Seattle. Yep, 2019 playoff teams that made few significant changes are in the best shape.
 “We’ve added a few different guys player-wise,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan says, “and we have added a couple of different coaches, but the foundation of our team and especially our defense and our defensive coordinator, that hasn’t changed. I do think that helps a lot, especially where we left off.”
 Teams that could struggle mightily after an offseason of constant upheaval are the Giants, Panthers, Browns, Raiders, Jaguars and Lions — all non-playoff clubs a year ago.

The city and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality have cooperated on monitoring water quality in City Creek for several years, working with students from the Pocatello Community Charter School to help collect water samples. Testing done both last fall and this summer confirms the creek exceeds water quality standards for bacteria and isn't safe for swimming or wading.
 Hannah Sanger, Science and Environment Division manager for the city, said another round of water-quality testing was recently conducted. The city hopes to collect data to pinpoint where bacteria levels are increasing throughout the creek's course, thereby facilitating strategic control measures.
 "The City of Pocatello is really focused on trying to figure out what we can do to try to reduce E. coli at City Creek," Sanger said.
 Sanger said it helped a lot when the city put in portable toilets at the upper and lower City Creek parking areas. The city has also added waste stations to encourage dog owners to pick up after their pets, and Sanger said educational signage is in the works.
 City Creek is a tributary of the Portneuf River, which flows through the city in a concrete channel that can become choked by garbage. Annually, the city teams up with Idaho State University's Stream Ecology Center, Portneuf Watershed Partnership, and Portneuf Valley Partners to host a river cleanup, filling several Dumpsters with trash.
 This year's cleanup was scheduled for 10 a.m. Aug. 29, with volunteers working from Raymond Park to the J.R. Simplot Don Plant.
 Marjanna Hulet, who leads a 14-member girls' troop through Scouts BSA, has participated with her Scouts for several years. Her group takes the concrete channel section, where water flows about a half foot deep.
 In the past, her Scouts have brought a pair of canoes for loading trash as they wade the channel. Filling two Dumpsters at the end of their trek. This year, Hulet opened the cleanup to the broader community and arranged to bring five boats. They remove mostly heavy objects during their cleanups.
 "We pull out shopping carts and bicycles. We've pulled out obviously stolen things," Hulet said. "One year we found a safe and a backpack with a computer in it. There are a lot of bikes people have stolen and don't want to deal with."
 Just as the Portneuf River has seen abuse, Hulet has observed users are having a more significant impact on local recreation areas. Hulet noted it's a widespread problem affecting all of the country, including the national parks.
 It's not a problem that's going away, she added.
 "It really means we have to step up our game in taking care of (recreation areas) so they don't become ruined for everyone," Hulet said. "We want people to love it. We want people out there recreating, but that also means we need some education on it."

Many within the league of primarily Black players have focused on the importance of voting, and the need for places in inner cities where minorities can do so safely. With no NBA games to play be played in November, arenas are an ideal place for it.
 Atlanta, Detroit, Charlotte and Sacramento were already on board. Houston’s Toyota Center was locked in this week, Rivers said Miami is working hard to make its facility available and all team owners who also control their arena property will work with local officials to turn their buildings into a voting location for the 2020 general election to allow for safe, in-person voting.
 Paul pointed out that practice facilities would be helpful if arenas can’t be secured.
 The players and the league will also immediately establish a social justice coalition, made up of players, coaches and owners, that will focus on issues such as voting access and advocating for meaningful police and criminal justice reform.
 And the NBA and players will work with TV networks to create advertising spots during the remainder of the postseason to promote greater engagement in the election process and their communities.
 Paul said he’d never seen anything like the events of the previous days during his 15 years in the league. He also spoke with Blake’s father.
 Not continuing the playoffs would have been another crushing blow during an already damaging season financially for the NBA and its players.
 With lost revenue from China after TV partners stopped televising games when Houston general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support of democratic protesters in Hong Kong, and no fans in arenas since March because of the coronavirus pandemic, the league was already headed for losses of hundreds of millions of dollars.
 Players had other reasons for wanting to stay.
 “We understand how strong our voice is, how powerful our voice is and ultimately we decided if we go away from this stage we don’t necessarily have that same platform so we stood in solidarity,” Paul said. “We’re going to continue to play but we’re also going to continue to make sure that our voices are heard.”

It was great fun to spend time with Woody behind the scenes on these occasions, as he understood the need to help bring positive media attention to marijuana legalization efforts, and he let us gently exploit him for that purpose. Also, he clearly enjoyed smoking good weed and hanging out with stoners, and up-close, Woody is a genuinely nice individual. But it was especially fascinating to appear at the Seattle Hempfest with Woody, where he was instantly recognized and mobbed by anyone in the immediate vicinity. People literally wanted to touch him and shake his hand. He was treated like a rock star.

Only a significant change to UNIFIL's purpose and capabilities on the ground can justify its existence," Ambassador Erdan said.

"When it came to dressing David Copperfield, all his coats and trousers were wool. Before he had money, all his waistcoats were wool. When he had money, he was influenced by Steerforth's waistcoats, and he's very influenced by him. So, we went a bit over the top with him with jagged patterns, and by the end of the film, he goes back to something sober when he's trying to make a mark and impress Dora. The ties and waistcoats could show what we were trying to do, and where David was.

Woody maintains a home in Maui, HI just down the road from Willie Nelson. The two of them have been friends for years, and when they are both off the road and spending personal time in Maui, Willie hosts a poker game at his home each afternoon, and Woody is a regular. Both are serious poker players, even as they burn some of the finest Hawaii weed. I had an opportunity in 2006 to fly out to Maui to spend some private time with Willie and a couple of mutual friends who also live on the island. I was only there for three or four days, but each afternoon or evening we would drop by Willie's house for one of his frequent poker games with his buddies, and Woody was always there. It was great fun to see the two of them just hanging out and getting wasted.
