I volunteered to test one of the messenger RNA vaccines in development, because it isn't powered by weakened virus. I didn't want to shed virus at a time when it's unclear how much viral shedding is infectious. Instead, this mRNA vaccine delivers marching orders to my muscle cells to produce the virus' spike protein that it will display on its surface. If my immune system is astute, it will recognize the spike protein and rally an immune response.

Lies. Year after year, researchers told lies to hundreds of Black men bamboozled into participating in one of this nation's most torturous studies. Special treatment just for them included painful spinal taps. They didn't really have bad blood, just syphilis -- which could have been treated by penicillin, a readily available medicine achingly kept out of reach.Black Lives didn't matter. But Black deaths carried a premium, so their plan was to track study participants till autopsy.When health authorities ignored a young Public Health Service worker's concerns and doubled down on the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male, he alerted the media. Scathing news coverage triggered the formation of an outside advisory panel whose findings shut down one of the nation's most shameful episodes.Understandably, mistrust of medical professionals continues to burn deeply.Yet, here I am.I climbed a couple of flights up to a non-descript clinical room adorned with aging travel posters of beaches now off-limits, waters dotted with cruise ships no longer safe to board.Pinching with two fingers, one of the study staff has primed a hunk of my upper left arm for a jab of one of the experimental COVID-19 vaccines the world has pinned its hopes on. Already, I've been weighed, my blood pressure checked, my internal organs assessed, an astonishing amount of my blood liberated and sloshing in a handful of test tubes, my nasal cavity conquered by swab. It's like getting water up your nose while swimming, they say. True enough. And equally unpleasant.These are among the unpleasantries that we volunteers undergo for federal regulators to gauge whether this and other potential COVID-19 remedies are safe and effective enough for millions around the globe to take. A vanishingly small number of clinical trial volunteers are Black, like me. We account for 21% of COVID-19 deaths, 13% of the U.S. population and a mere 3% of vaccine clinical trial volunteers.The troubling shadow of Tuskegee is one explanation why.Myriad polls have taken the pulse of the jittery U.S. citizenry, gauging our willingness to roll up a sleeve for a shot of COVID-19 vaccine. One of the largest polls finds that Black Americans completely buy into vaccination as a way to create a firebreak to slow SARS-CoV-2's wildfire spread. But only 14% to 18% of Black Americans mostly or completely trust that a COVID-19 vaccine will be safe or effective. The same poll finds that knowing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study sends the likelihood of the Black people getting a COVID-19 vaccine plummeting.Unlike Tuskegee, the world is watching in real-time.I leave the clinic toting a bright red bag with study materials, a digital thermometer, a notebook and a cell phone loaded with an app that I'll use to report side effects. A study recently published by the New England Journal of Medicine about this novel vaccine candidate indicated its woes could include pain, swelling, flu-like symptoms, fever.The next day, I report tenderness in my upper arm near where I got the shot. If I were aboard a plane trying to empty the overhead bin, my left arm wouldn't be up to the task. Fortunately, the pain subsided by the next day.Like the study staff, I am blinded so I don't know if I got the real deal or a dummy shot. And they've asked me not to get an antibody test. I don't react to the seasonal flu vaccine, so feeling like someone punched me in the deltoid was kinda good news. Maybe I got the actual vaccine.For seven days, I balance a thermometer under my tongue for a few seconds, tapping answers and my temperature into the app and pressing submit. I get a follow-up call asking similar questions about symptoms and inquiring whether I've taken any medicine.As a reporter when Colorado was the epicenter for West Nile Virus infections, I remember someone broke into a pharmacy to steal medicines that were in short supply. Also during my reporting days, I appeared on C-SPAN to talk about a shortage of the annual flu vaccine. Anxious Americans, especially people made vulnerable by chronic health conditions, wanted the shot, including a panicked woman whose anxiety I tried to allay.There won't be sufficient COVID-19 vaccine in the early months, so states are working on detailed distribution plans. But no one's busting down pharmacy doors this time. A sizable chunk of the U.S. is leery about the COVID-19 vaccine, fearing research teams cut corners to deliver outgoing President Trump a campaign talking point. Even doctors and nurses are among those warily watching from the sidelines.I keep an eagle eye on Eric Topol's Twitter feed.He's applauded the sprint from SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to reports this month of impressive vaccine efficacy as one of science and medical research's greatest achievements. He's also on the prowl for missteps. Topol illustrates posts to his 351,000 Twitter followers with journal articles marked up with yellow highlighter. He's taken the Trump administration to task for lacking a national pandemic plan and for letting politics prevail. He's chided AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford for bad lack of transparency and lauded the World Health Organization for making the right call after reviewing all remdesivir data.Unlike Tuskegee, results from this trial may help others.I volunteered to test one of the messenger RNA vaccines in development, because it isn't powered by weakened virus. I didn't want to shed virus at a time when it's unclear how much viral shedding is infectious. Instead, this mRNA vaccine delivers marching orders to my muscle cells to produce the virus' spike protein that it will display on its surface. If my immune system is astute, it will recognize the spike protein and rally an immune response. I envision a mini red flag waved at a charging baby bull and hope I've already begun to build antibodies from the first injection.Around the nation, some 30,000 of us have participated in Moderna's clinical trial, and the company announced Nov. 30 that its experimental therapy was 94% effective at preventing COVID-19 and 100% effective at preventing severe disease.A month later, I'm back for a second dose, the money shot. Already, I know that more side effects are associated with this second shot. Unexpected things can happen, like young healthy volunteers who ended up hospitalized while testing a novel monoclonal antibody. Even this mRNA vaccine left one volunteer shaking with fever and racked with pain.I felt discomfort in my left (non-dominant) arm quicker with the second shot, occurring the same afternoon as the shot. The tenderness was episodic. I could type just fine, elbows at 90 degrees. But yikes, when I reached on top of the fridge for a paper towel, I was quick to switch to my right arm to dodge the pain. Tapping at the app, I noticed potential side effects had grown to a laundry list, now including headache, fatigue, muscle aches, aches in several joints, nausea/vomiting, chills. Fortunately, the pain wasn't enough to require a painkiller.I'll return to clinic three more times for additional bloodlettings, will send updates via app monthly, and cap it off with a final clinic visit about two years from now.Weeks ago, during my first visit to clinic, we reviewed the informed consent. Because I already read it, I only had a couple of questions. But other study participants wanted to know what would happen if the FDA rules on the therapy while the study is underway. As one would expect, the volunteers in the placebo arm would get the vaccine.Unlike Tuskegee, I will receive medicine.Diedtra Henderson is a freelance science writer and former print news reporter with more than 20 years of experience working as a staff writer for the Miami Herald, Seattle Times, Denver Post, Associated Press, and Boston Globe.

A significant but underappreciated segment of the telemedicine industry -- direct-to-consumer (DTC) telemedicine services -- may hold clues to the future of telemedicine in the post-pandemic world.The pre-pandemic DTC market was dominated by three medical issues -- urinary tract infections, erectile dysfunction, and contraception -- that together accounted for 87.1% of one DTC company's visits compared with only 2.3% of visits to primary care physicians, found Tara Jain, MD, MBA, and Ateev Mehrotra, MD, MPH, both of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.Their data in JAMA Network Open reflected televisits made by one unnamed DTC company from October through December 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic drastically transformed the telemedicine landscape. But the findings highlight issues that may predict how telehealth will find a lasting place after the pandemic wanes.It's easy to overlook the DTC market, Mehrotra told MedPage Today. When we think about the future of telemedicine, there's a lot of focus on the primary care physician and the local hospital. DTC is not the typical form of telemedicine most of us think of. But this approach appeals to many people, he said.In 2018 and 2019, DTC companies such as Teladoc and Doctor on Demand provided more than 1 million visits and were estimated to represent a $272-million market in 2019, projected to grow to $322.7 million by 2025, according to a recent market report.In March, with the spread of COVID-19 and an emergency order from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expand access to and coverage for telemedicine, the volume of such visits soared. After a peak in mid-April, there has been a drop in telemedicine visits, although the level remains far higher than before the pandemic.Large questions loom for Congress and federal policymakers about telemedicine coverage post-pandemic, with huge implications for the market.Hundreds of companies are providing DTC telemedicine, often specializing in a single or a few diagnoses, whether mental health, diabetes, or substance abuse disorder.We have to remember these other companies, some of which were surging before the pandemic, Mehrotra said. We've learned that telemedicine is important to improving access to care. We want doctors to do more of it, but do we want DTC companies? We've been talking a lot about coordinated, integrated care; and yet you have these DTC companies solving patients' problems more cheaply, more easily, and in some cases with higher quality care.His cross-sectional, patient-deidentified analysis included all the patients seen by the unnamed DTC company in that quarter -- a total of 35,131 televisits in 20 states. Comparators came from the overall population in those states and with ambulatory primary care physician visits in those states between 2013 and 2016, as compiled in the CDC's National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.Sociodemographic differences in the DTC patient population versus primary care visits included a much younger age (with 74.1% of the former between the ages of 18 and 44, compared with 29.4% for primary care visits), fewer reported comorbidities, residence in wealthier urban communities, accessing care outside of normal business hours, and paying out of pocket for the service.This younger population may find online care more convenient or may feel uncomfortable receiving care for sexual issues in person, the authors suggested.Another DTC advantage is allowing patients to initiate the medical encounter when they choose. However, at the time of Jain and Mehrotra's study, the DTC company studied was not accepting insurance for patient visits, which thus were all paid out-of-pocket by the patient.These distinctions make comparisons between DTC telemedicine and primary care physician visits difficult, said Bradley Fox, MD, director of clinical informatics for electronic health record giant Epic Systems Corporation, which also studies the market. What kinds of visits are they talking about?Jain and Mehrotra acknowledged that their data were limited to a single company and to the set of services offered by that company, Fox noted.Telemedicine can be defined in different ways, he added, some with video and synchronous conversations and some without. Our data come through larger health care organizations and health systems, all of which are submitting claims for these services. Will DTC companies try to pivot to get into networks where more of what they do gets covered? He also expects increasing competition with DTC business models.Many healthcare organizations had dipped their toes into virtual care prior to 2020, but now it has become a core part of their business that's here to stay, Fox predicted.We don't see a world where telemedicine goes away, he said. It will continue to grow, even though it won't replace face-to-face visits for all needs. People will seek it, more and more, both for convenience and as we learn more about the quality of this care.

Tucked at the far end of the plaza, much less obvious than its bigger neighbors, was A Lot of Thai, and we thought it would be worth checking out sometime. That recent rainy night was the time.
 There was only one party seated when we arrived, and we were shown to a table in the back half of the fairly narrow space. The restaurant is divided into two sections; the front, which includes the bar and several tables, is wider and brighter, thanks to its big cut-glass chandeliers.
 We sat in the rear section, which has a row of tables along one wall and a long banquette with high-top tables along the other. The semi-open kitchen is at the back of the room. The lighting was much dimmer here — we’re at the age where we needed to use our cellphone flashlights to read the menu.
 The two-sided, placemat-sized menu is loaded with colorful pictures of many of the dishes, which only made it harder to choose. As we browsed, we kept pointing to the images and saying “Hey, that looks good,” countering with “Yeah, but look at this one!”
 We started with a couple of appetizers that were on the specials menu: Fresh Spring Rolls and Crispy Chive Cakes.
 Mrs. Gourmet raved about the chive cakes ($7). The little gently fried cubes were packed with chives and their mild onion flavor. The dark brown color made us ask what the cakes were made from, but were told it was just flour. In any case, they and the soy based sauce that accompanied them were great.
 As we ordered, our server advised us that the spring rolls ($7) were fresh, not deep fried, which is what we expected. But what we weren’t expecting was that the four big rolls would be all-veggie. They were wrapped in lettuce and packed with more greens, avocado and cabbage shreds — sort of a lettuce- wrapped salad. They were served with a peanut chili sauce (of which we could have used more) that added some flavor, but overall, we found them too big and too boring.
 Mrs. G bounced around the menu, picking out two or three entrees before settling on the Avocado Curry ($17). This ample bowl contained chicken, shrimp, an entire sliced avocado and assorted vegetables in a great coconut curry sauce. Mrs. G raved about this dish, particularly the sauce, which layered on flavors from coconut to sweet to spicy. “This is SO GOOD,” she said — over and over.
 Duck fan that I am, I quickly decided on the Spicy Crispy Duck ($24). A generous combination of breast and leg meat was perfectly cooked, moist and with crispy skin intact. The entire dish — which also included mushrooms, onions, peppers and bok choy — was covered with a spicy brown chili sauce that was hearty and meaty tasting but not too hot, a perfect compliment to the duck.
 Both entrees, which were served with a wild rice mix, were ample, and we took about half of each home for lunch the next day.
 The service was friendly, prompt and helpful. We had questions about several dishes, and our server, Tarn, had the answers at the ready.
 Value factor was good, with almost everything on the menu under $20.
 These being tough times for restaurants (and a bad night to be out), there were only a handful of parties in the restaurant by the time we left. But several more people came in to pick up takeout orders while we were there. That got us thinking that A Lot of Thai would be a great spot for us to order some takeout over the holidays.
 One way or another, we plan to go back.

"Something's not right here," said Reed, who lives in East Lampeter Township.
 The explanation is well known -- in many states, an influx of mail-in ballots, overwhelmingly cast by Democrats, were tallied later than ballots cast in person. Still, Reed said he thought the courts should have spent more time investigating.
 "I'll always believe that it was stolen from him. I'll really never be able to have peace of mind that it wasn't," he said.
 Others were less willing to go along.
 "I don't trust that result. I think that the election was a fraud. I think the election was stolen. I don't know how anybody could not think that. All you have to do is look at the results," said Katherine Negrete, 55, a teacher living in Peoria, Arizona.
 Negrete is among those who holds out hope that Trump can win if the Supreme Court intervenes (there is no indication that will happen) or Congress chooses to accept an "alternative slate" of Trump electors from several states. Election experts have said that scheme has no legal pathway and Republican Senate leaders have discouraged it.
 Still, Negrete said, "hopefully Congress will do the right thing" and she expressed frustration with dwindling options.
 "I don't know what we can do about that. If we don't have the courts that stand up for us," she said. "If we don't have an attorney general that will stand up and say, 'This was wrong and we need to investigate it.' What are we supposed to do? Do we need to fight brother against brother? It's crazy."
 Biden has vowed to bring Americans together and work across the aisle. His success on both fronts may depend on how many Republicans hold on to their election grievances. A Quinnipiac University poll from earlier this month found that 38% of registered voters, including 77% of Republicans, said they believe there was widespread fraud in the presidential election.
 And a recent Fox News poll found 36% of voters, including 77% of Trump voters, believe the election was stolen from Trump. However, the same poll also found that about 8 in 10 voters overall, and about half of Trump voters, said they will at least give Biden a chance as president.
 Matt Vereline, 52, a member of the pro-Trump group "Long Island Loud Majority" is not in the mood for reconciliation.
 Vereline, who lives in Bohemia, New York, is convinced "there was a lot more voter fraud than we know about," though he's not sure whether it changed the outcome. But that won't keep him from rallying around what he thinks was an injustice. After all, that's what Democrats did to Trump, he says.
 "Did they not cry for four years about Russian collusion, which wasn't proven? So now I'm going to to cry about voter fraud for four years," he said. "They didn't accept it. Why should I accept Biden? I know I can't do nothing about it. I know a rally is not going to change the course of who gets elected president. It's whatever will be will be. But if my friends want to get together and complain about it in a peaceful way and voice our opinions, I'm going."
 Others believe Biden won fair and square. Steve Volkman, a Republican who works in construction in Mesa, Arizona, said he made peace with Trump's loss weeks ago.
 "I voted for Trump, but people gotta get over it," Volkman said, while leaning against his pickup truck. "For sure, he (Biden) won the majority vote -- landslide. To me, it's already over."
 Catherine Templeton, a South Carolina Republican who served in former Gov. Nikki Haley's administration, said that, despite the level of support for Trump in red states like her own, she felt sure voters would be willing to accept Biden as president.
 "Obviously, South Carolina supports President Trump, but I think you'll see when Republicans don't get their way, they move on," said Templeton, who lives in Charleston. "It's time to move on."
 It remains to be seen, for now, how lingering concerns over the integrity of the vote will affect turnout in future elections. Both parties have been focused on Georgia, where a pair of runoff elections will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
 Denise Adams, 50, said she has her doubts about "questionable activity" in the general election. But she turned out to vote early on Monday in Kennesaw, a suburb northwest of Atlanta.
 "I don't want to lose our freedoms," she said, repeating misleading GOP claims that the Democrats would usher in "socialism." "We're losing our rights and freedoms in our country."
 "I've never had a problem before now trusting it, but now I feel like there may be something going on that I don't trust," echoed Melissa McJunkin, 40, who remains concerned about the integrity of her vote after hearing stories of voter fraud in the general election, but turned out anyway.
 "I think it's important for what's going to happen next," she said.

Mr Patrick Oboi Amuriat, the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) party presidential candidate, has told the Electoral Commission (EC) that he will not show up at their offices to explain alleged violation of campaign guidelines.
 Mr Amuriat also said the Commission will be making a grave mistake if they disqualify him from the presidential race.
 While answering questions from journalists in Mbale Town before proceeding to Namutumba and Luuka districts for his campaign rallies yesterday, Mr Amuriat said the campaign schedule is so tight and he cannot spare a single day to meet the Commission.
 He said the summons to meet the EC in person do not hold water and that if it becomes necessary that they want to meet him, it must be on Christmas Day when he will be free.
 “If we took one day off the campaigns, that means we will not have time to come back to the areas we have not gone to. So the EC has to choose time to meet us and if they want to meet me in person, then it has to be on December 25,” he said.
 He added: “Secondly, I am not a candidate of my own, I am not an Independent candidate. I am a candidate sponsored by FDC party. A few days ago, the [party] secretary general did respond to the request of the EC for me to appear in person and raised pertinent issues.”

I’M ASHAMED that I imagined the Supreme Court might overturn the election. It goes to show how far down the river of unreality a man can go, even a man who has authored books. (OK, fiction, but still.) I imagined they might go on to overturn Newton’s first law of motion but instead they turned the president upside down and held him by his ankles until, despite powerful spray-on adhesives, his hair hung down.
 I confessed my self-deception in church Sunday, which now I attend in my pajamas, sitting in the kitchen, watching on a screen as clergy in vestments process around the sanctuary and ascend into the pulpit. It makes me feel more like a penitent than when I dressed up as a bank vice president to attend in person — here I sit, O Lord, unwashed, uncombed, undeodorized, in a T-shirt and sackcloth pants, cup of black coffee in hand. I live in a prosperous and civilized land and I thought that four men and one woman in black robes might bring democracy to a shuddering halt. Forgive my cynicism.
 The rector stood in the pulpit and reminded us that it is Advent, not yet Christmas, a time of waiting and repentance, a full about-face U-turn if necessary. The Gospels are not secretive. “Love your neighbor as yourself” suggests that no child should go hungry or suffer lousy schooling, the sick should be tended to, the trash-talkers should think again. Pajama Man, who doubted the Supremes, is resolved to be hopeful. Change is possible. The newspaper lands in my Inbox now, and there is oat milk in the fridge. My phone lights up and a friendly face appears, my daughter is FaceTiming me from London. We never had that verb before, just two-timing and mistiming.
 I read that on December 21, Jupiter and Saturn will appear so close to each other in the sky that they’ll seem like one bright star, a conjunction that hasn’t occurred since the early 17th century and won’t occur again until 2080. I would be 138 in 2080 and so this month appears to be my one chance to reap whatever benefit the bright star might confer and who can say what that might be? I wish it would make us smarter. Clear thinking is one thing a great many of us need. We’re all feeling a little smug because we had a president who set a low standard. The man couldn’t even tell a joke. Humor was not in his toolbox. So compared to him, we felt rather good about ourselves. Now we need to work a little harder to ratiocinate. I am going to go outside on December 21 and let the light shine on me and think about algebra and see if any of it comes back to me or if I remember the Sermon on the Mount.
 Time to refresh our understanding of the basic building blocks of adult life:
 There is only so much you can do and you ought to do that much and if you do you’ll find there is more you can do so try that too. The way to get something done is to do it. The way to stop is to stop. When all is said and done, there is plenty to be done and that goes without saying.
 Don’t stick beans up your nose. Acts have consequences. Step on a crack and break your mother’s back. Life is too short for that and it’s getting shorter every day. On the other hand, don’t buy cheap shoes.
 Lighten up. It could be worse. Be grateful that it isn’t. I could compile a Worse list but you already know what’s on it. Granted, it is a challenge to live intimately with your best-informed critic but do your best. The cure for a horrible day is to go to bed early and start over in the morning. Long walks help, so I am told.
 When you are defeated, concede gracefully and go on to the next order of business. Your friends are fond of you but they have other things to do than deny reality in your behalf. Do what you need to do, go to Florida, and hire better lawyers. And go outside next Monday night and let the light shine into our skulls. We were made in the image of God and it is time to start doing better. Care for the children, save the planet, stop hallucinating and pay attention.

ALBION — Maybe it’s because she has always preferred to be a behind the scenes influence.
 Janeie Meyer’s favorite thing about 4-H? Watching the siblings of prominent 4-H’ers become prominent themselves.
 “I’m just wired that way,” Meyer said. “I enjoy watching siblings who are shadows of the older siblings, to see those younger siblings (thrive).”
 Meyer, who has meant as much to local 4-H as the county fair, will be retiring this month after nearly 31 years serving as program assistant with the Purdue Cooperative Extension Office in Albion.
 The list of her 4-H involvements includes:
 • Dairy
 • Dogs
 • Forestry
 • Wildlife and
 • Sewing.
 In truth, she’s had her hand in about every facet of the program.
 She and her husband, Paul, were instrumental in the formation of the 4-H Archery Club.
 For 11 years, she served as the Indiana State Fair Horse and Pony secretary. She’s organized various non-fair competitions from livestock judging for youngsters to helping organize the Northeastern Indiana Dairy Steer Show.
 She is a past member of the Noble County Fair Board, and is a member of the Eastern Indiana Agriculture Association, which owns the fairgrounds.
 She’s found sponsors of the awards given at the Noble County Fair, helped arrange for judges and ordered fair banners, too.
 “It’s been a long time since I’ve had a summer I can do things with,” Meyer said. “It’s a 12-month job.”
 She’s also been involved with such non-4-H-related endeavors as agriculture/natural resources assistant and consumer and family sciences assistant.
 And, of course, there’s the fair, a weeklong commitment when the entire extension office moves to Kendallville to the fairgrounds.
 Through the course of her duties, she’s learned to be a person who can overcome obstacles and problems.
 “I think of myself as a fixer,” Meyer said. “I can do that. I can make that happen.”
 Meyer’s own 4-H roots run deep. Her older brother was a 10-year 4-H member. She didn’t quite get that far.
 “I only made it through eight,” she said.
 But she has always been a huge fan of the program.
 “4-H was a big part of me when I was younger,” she said.
 A 1975 graduate of Central Noble High School, Meyer was living in Whitley County and working in a Columbia City drug store when the program assistant job came open at the Noble County 4-H Extension Office.
 She interviewed in December of 1989, and her first day on the job was Feb. 5, 1990.
 Janeie and Paul had moved from Noble County to rural Churubusco in August 1989.
 “I had to move to Whitley County to get a job in Noble County,” she said.
 One of the things that has been reinforced with her is the power of 4-H — and the people who participate in the program.
 “If you start a project, people will help you,” she said. “It’s a big family. It’s a 4-H family.
 “I can go to Australia and talk to a 4-H’er and we’d have a connection.”
 One of the draws to the program is that there are so many opportunities, from showing animals at the fair to rocketry, sewing, photography and mechanics.
 “4-H is such a broad thing,” Meyer said. “The kids learn by doing it.”
 And Meyer had made her mark by facilitating that doing, by putting the kind of time and energy into her work that makes it more than just a job. In turn, this has made 4-H more than just another activity for so many Noble County youngsters.
 The countless hours and stress have been worth it, she said, if she has been able to “be a part, a little small part, of helping a kid grow.”
 Along with getting her summers — and winters — back, Meyer said she would like to spend more time around the house helping her husband.
 Paul was paralyzed after falling from a tree stand in September 2003. He has been wheelchair-bound ever since.
 Janeie met Paul in May 1974. The couple were married in September 1975.
 The couple’s sons, Joe and Jeff, have given Janeie and Paul seven grandchildren, who are ages 6-16.
 “I’ve got 13 years of 4-H ahead of me,” she said.
 It’s a great program for getting kids involved, teaching them responsibility and how to get along with others.
 “It’s a phenomenal program,” Meyer said. “Kids don’t have to be in 4-H, but they need to be in something.”

Offensive meme calls for lawmaker’s resignation
 To the Editor: Newly-elected state Representative and school board member Dawn Johnson of Laconia recently published an anti-Semitic and racist meme on social media.
 My grandfather Max came to the United States alone at the age of 13 from Poland to escape the Nazis. Subsequently, his entire family was wiped out for the crime of being Jewish. He came to this country not speaking a word of English but worked hard and ultimately became a successful small business owner. He raised four children and was beloved by all of his nine grandchildren. Max was one of the kindest, and most gentle people you could ever hope to meet, and he would have given the shirt off of his back to anyone in need.
 Any individual who thinks it’s a good idea to post material from a Neo Nazi website, along with ignorant, bigoted images has no place in the state House of Representatives. I do not want to serve in a legislative body that is home to any kind of hate against individuals because of their race, religion, creed or color.
 I am hopeful that the House leadership and Governor Chris Sununu will ask Rep. Johnson to do the right thing and resign from office in order to protect the dignity and standing of our legislative body.

The visiting Wolverines came out strong with a 16-3 run to open the game, putting the Eagles in debt early. Thanks to some gritty defense from players like Colton Brennan and Matt Stile, Heartland Christian kept themselves within striking distance down 29-12 at the half, but still had trouble kick starting their offense.
 “It was hard to get in rhythm tonight,” HC coach Larry Gray said. “If we make a shot and try to go on a run we turned the ball over, and that’s not a way to go on a run. We work hard in practice on the small things and once we get the smaller things of the game down, I think we’ll be alright.”
 The Wolverines would create some pressure of their own in the second half as they went on to outscore the Eagles 27-10 to end the game. The Eagles just were not able to get the offense going as Gray says the team just didn’t execute the little things.
