Padgett arrived on campus at 17, having skipped a grade in grammar school. By the end of his true freshman season, he was a starter at the game’s most physically demanding position.
 “He was a rough and tumble guy too,” Gary Barnett recalled. “An offensive lineman has to love the grind, getting down and dirty, and Ryan did.”
 In March, Barnett was added to a text chain that described a dire situation — a member of the Northwestern family was on life support because of COVID-19. Barnett saw #teamryan and texted coach Pat Fitzgerald: IS THIS PAT RYAN?
 No, it was Padgett, an emergency medicine specialist in Kirkland, Wash., outside Seattle. In late February, EvergreenHealth — the hospital where he works — became America’s ground zero for the coronavirus pandemic.
 “I was on the night we got the confirmation a person had died,” Padgett said. “The first case. We had a little huddle amongst the ER doctors. We knew the world was going to change.”
 Padgett, 45, became a doctor because of sports. As a teenager, he tore his rotator cuff pitching and injured both knees playing football. At Northwestern, he watched in awe as team physician Howard Sweeney performed a knee replacement.
 His post-college health was exemplary. He took just five sick days in 21 years, and some of those were necessitated by back surgeries.
 But days after treating elderly patients gasping for air, he developed headaches and muscle soreness. Then a fever of 104 and a dry cough. His oxygen levels dropped and his heart rate soared. Did he have the flu? Pneumonia? Padgett was in denial.

States have universally struggled to get enough tests, but while some states are doing better with testing, some are resorting to unusual methods in the absence of more help from the federal government. In April, Maryland bought 500,000 tests from a South Korean company and flew them into the state on board a passenger airplane, but the Baltimore Sun reported it remains unclear if the tests were ever distributed.

But it's also an impressive technical feat that will rip your lungs out for long stretches. The largely improvised tale of an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances places you squarely in the gut-wrenching position of its protagonist.
 Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, First Officer Tobias Ellis is a calm, serious young American aviator based in Germany working an evening Berlin-to-Paris flight with 85 passengers aboard. The crew includes Michael (Carlo Kitzlinger), the flight's captain, and Gökce (Aylin Tezel), a flight attendant and the mother of Tobias' 2-year-old son.

He singles out Halkbank of Turkey, a financial institution investigated for a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. At a side encounter during a Buenos Aires summit meeting in late 2018, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey handed Trump a memo by the law firm representing Halkbank, “which Trump did nothing more than flip through before declaring he believed Halkbank was totally innocent.” He then told Erdogan “he would take care of things.”
 Attorney General William Barr later spent months trying to negotiate a settlement with the bank, but that came to an end in October, after Bolton left office, when the Justice Department charged Halkbank in a six-count indictment.
 Bolton also mentions ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications giant that was convicted of evading sanctions on Iran and North Korea and then faced new penalties for further violations during its follow-up consent decree. During a conversation on trade with President Xi Jinping of China, Trump offered to lighten the penalties.
 “Xi replied that if that were done, he would owe Trump a favor and Trump immediately responded he was doing this because of Xi,” Bolton writes. He called himself “appalled” and “stunned” by the idea of intervening in a criminal investigation to let a sanctions buster off the hook. In the end, the Justice Department accepted a $1 billion fine and lifted a seven-year ban on buying American products, an act of lenience that saved the company from going out of business.
 A new allegation in the book accuses Trump of “pleading” with Xi to help him win reelection by buying American agricultural products, which would help the president in farm states. Trump did not deny it when asked about the matter Wednesday night by Sean Hannity on Fox News, but Robert Lighthizer, his trade representative, did on his behalf earlier in the day, saying it was not true.
 ##  Describing a toxic environment inside the administration
 Over a long career in and out of Republican administrations in Washington, Bolton has rarely shied from giving his opinions, usually born of strong conservative national security convictions that have made him one of the capital’s most outspoken hawks advocating the use of military power and sanctions.

Fast-forward to May 4, when the FDA altered its policy on antibody tests, requiring companies to present data that proved their tests actually worked. That move cut down on the number of tests, but “unfortunately, this is one of those things where the horse is out of the barn already,” Flanigan said. Many people are unaware that they need to check the FDA website to see if a specific test is up to snuff before using the results to decide how to live their lives.

 Padgett planned all along to play in the 1992 season opener between Northwestern and Notre Dame. But he thought he’d be wearing gold and blue.
 Padgett was a big-time recruit at Newport High School outside of Seattle. Sporting News named him one of the nation’s top 24 scholar-athletes, and Max Emfinger’s Prep Football Report rated him the nation’s fifth-best guard. He was an ideal prospect for Notre Dame, a perennial top-10 team under Lou Holtz.
