We now know that Biden will be president, but he won’t have the votes for FDR- size legislation. This doesn’t mean he’s dead in the water, but it does mean that Biden will have to marshal every resource and rely on every possible ally to win whatever victories he can. And he should know, as Roosevelt did, that this means grappling with the left — all of the left, including its most radical edges.
 The Social Security Act of 1935, which established the nation’s old age and unemployment insurance programs, as well as its first stab at maternal assistance, represents traditional Democratic Party liberalism at its best: simple, broad-based and pragmatic. The basis for the American welfare state — and derided by opponents at the time as an example of “creeping socialism” — it remains a potent example of the power of government to help ordinary people. What the public knows is that it was the product of Roosevelt and the New Deal. Missing from this story is how much the law owes to the activism and agitation of the American left.

“Musicians are really missing performing with each other and we really miss our audiences,” Sears said. “People are moving into the hall, and there’s the excitement of the performance filling up the seats, and everybody’s anticipating it and then there’s the applause ... there’s the whole social aspect of it too.”
 NMC’s visual communication students combined all the individual performance videos into one finished product.
 That means aligning about 720 clips between the eight movements, which can be much more work on the back end compared to a live production where everything builds up to one day.
 “There’s so much more work behind the scenes in order of magnitude,” Cobb said. “When you prepare for a concert we rehearse together and then we all show up to perform together — here it’s so much more work on everybody’s part.”
 Laura Cobb’s book has three main characters, a gardener, a lark and a girl. Jeffrey Cobb chose to compose the performance so the book is plotted out in different movements and each character in the book is represented by a voice in choir. The choir plays the role of the gardener with two soloists representing the girl and the lark. Laura Cobb will read the narration of the book herself.
 “When I sat down to start composing it, I just I couldn’t believe how quickly it came,” Jeffrey Cobb said. “The text is just really spoke to me and pushed me along and was so inspiring. It kind of wrote itself.”
 Sears thinks the piece is timely as a tribute to the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the historical prominence of Kamala Harris becoming the first woman elected as vice president.
 “The music Jeff composed is so interested, and it covers so many different classical and jazz styles,” Sears said. “It was really fun to play.”
 The production airs Dec. 4 from 7-8:30 p.m.

Stephen Dorff is glad he lost out on the lead role in Titanic to Leonardo DiCaprio because he thinks the film "wasn't a great movie".
 The 47-year-old revealed that he was in the running for the part of ill-fated artist Jack in James Cameron's 1997 epic historical drama, and even did a screen test with Kate Winslet, who played Jack's love interest Rose.
 "I was in the final running for it. I did a test with Kate Winslet. At one point, it was my part to lose," Dorff told Variety. "Then it became his part, and it wasn't going my way. It kept changing hands. The last players in the mix were me and DiCaprio, that I know."
 The True Detective star speculated that it was DiCaprio's role in Baz Luhrmann's hit 1996 romantic drama Romeo + Juliet that convinced studio bosses at Fox to hire him instead of Dorff.
 "We both had movies at Fox. Mine was a dark Bob Rafelson movie (Blood and Wine) that was awesome with Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine and J. Lo. His was Romeo and Juliet, which was testing pretty good with the young kids and had a hot soundtrack," he explained. "Whatever the reason was, it was what it was. Titanic the movie became a juggernaut."
 However, Dorff wasn't a fan of the hit movie and said the storyline between Jack and Rose was too schmaltzy for him.
 "To me, it wasn't a great movie. It was kind of a soppy, really on the nose kind of love story. But yeah, it pulls your heartstrings," he shared. "I don't go backwards. There are movies that I should have done that were big hits. You've got to just keep going."
 The blockbuster, which focused on the events of the infamous sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, raked in more than $2 billion (£1.5 billion) at the worldwide box office and won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron.

Kim Ng is eager to get to work, to start forming the Miami Marlins into a team that can make a repeat postseason run after shocking the baseball world and reaching the National League Division Series in Major League Baseball's pandemic-truncated 2020 season. The new general manager's hire came almost a month into the offseason, with free agency in full swing.
 So the expectation should be that the Marlins, fresh off a playoff run and hoping to keep that momentum going, would make a big splash early, right?
 Well, not exactly.
 Most of MLB, the Marlins included, is treading lightly to start the Hot Stove season with so much uncertainty surrounding the sport due to the lingering implications from COVID-19, which is seeing a second surge in the United States. More than 250,000 people in the U.S. have died due to the novel coronavirus.
 "MLB is working very hard on the different options and avenues, and I think really we are held a little bit of a hostage at this point to the pandemic, to COVID," Ng said on MLB Network. "Really, where we are with the vaccine, I think that's going to be a huge, huge part of this. We'll just have to wait and see."

Thanksgiving this year will be markedly different. Theaters are closed in most places. And even if you could go to the movies (and I still haven’t been since February), the pickings are slim. Which means that after Thanksgiving dinner with our immediate families or our quarantine pods, we won’t be taking that brisk walk from the car to the multiplex, the cold air (here in Southern California, it might even dip below 50!) blowing through the tryptophan as we debate between the latest Disney or Pixar animated offering and whatever family holiday bauble might be playing. It might not even be all that good. But as long as we’re out of the house and away from any possibility that someone might stumble across “Love Actually” on TV, all is right in my world.
 But now we’re going to be stuck at home. Which means there’s real, imminent danger that I’m going to be unable to escape that glob of glib British whimsy when it starts airing round the clock. (Is there a cut of “Love Actually” on YouTube that edits out every exhausting subplot but keeps the Bill Nighy bits?)

“We really want to maintain and bring out power anyway so we wouldn’t have been doing a lot of heavy lifting anyways,” Gle said of his football athletes in the middle of a playoff run. “We’re trying to keep things light and explosive so sprinting and plyometrics are going to be our go-to until we are allowed back together again.”
 In-person competition and practices are suspended through at least Dec. 9 following the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ new order, but schools are finding ways to keep their athletes engaged during lockdown.
 Practices across the board have changed with many athletes undertaking at-home workouts and online team meetings in order to stay sharp. Trojans head football coach and teacher Eric Schugars said keeping his athletes engaged is the hardest part.
 Teams are being forced to review film and have large group meetings over the internet, and it only adds to the challenges.
 “They are in a remote learning environment stuck in front of a computer screen, so you have to encourage them to stay active between classes,” Schugars said. “It’s just constant contact and encouraging. Then you hope the relationships and the accountability partners we have on our team and the team leaders will do everything they can to keep everybody engaged and in shape for getting after it again in December.”
 The Trojans incorporated more body-weight workouts, yoga, pilates and plyometrics to make sure everyone can get a solid workout regardless of equipment available at home. Schugars and Gle emphasize the importance of sprinting, as the weather still permits outdoor running.
 Luckily for some students, they acquired at-home weights and gear during the first sports shutdown and have been able to get right back into the groove.
 “We kind of got used to it, so we are used to doing online school then getting our own work in,” TC Central senior football player Austin Bills said. “It’s nothing really new for this year.”
 The CoachMePlus app also allows Gle to give remote assessments for his class and track athletes’ progress over long periods of time.
 Johannesburg-Lewiston football coach Joe Smokevitch stays in contact with his players via text, Zoom and even SnapChat as he’s in quarantine until Wednesday. The break actually makes it possible for him to coach the Cardinals when they take on Iron Mountain in the Division 8 regional finals.
 Smokevitch said many of his players had to work out on their own during the spring shutdown, so it’s nothing new.
 “The whole thing is so weird,” Smokevitch said. “But if we get a chance to play, that’s all I want.”

What does emergency use of a COVID-19 vaccine mean? It's when regulators allow shots to be given to certain people while studies of safety and effectiveness are ongoing. Before any vaccine is permitted in the U.S., it must be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, which requires study in thousands of people. Normally, the process to approve a new vaccine can take about a decade. But the federal government is using various methods to dramatically speed up the process for COVID-19 vaccines. During a health crisis, the FDA can loosen its normal scientific standards to allow emergency use of experimental drugs, devices, vaccines and other medical products. The first vaccines to get the provisional green light in the U.S. are almost certain to be made available under this process, known as emergency use authorization. Instead of the usual requirement of “substantial evidence” of safety and effectiveness for approval, the FDA can allow products onto the market as long as their benefits are likely to outweigh their risks. It has already used its emergency powers to authorize hundreds of coronavirus tests and a handful of treatments during the pandemic. But the agency has almost no experience granting emergency use for vaccines and has laid out extra standards it will use to make decisions on upcoming COVID-19 shots. In October, FDA officials told vaccine makers they should have two months of safety follow-up from half of the people enrolled in their studies before requesting emergency authorization. That data is expected to be enough for FDA to allow vaccinations of certain high-risk groups, such as front-line health workers and nursing home residents. Full approval of a vaccine will likely require six months of safety follow-up as well as extensive inspections...

Herbert has been a fantasy stud in his rookie season and is averaging 26.2 DraftKings points per game. There was only one game this season that he didn't eclipse the 20 point mark which was in Week 2 where he only got 19.7. He is having one of the best rookie seasons of all time at the QB position and that should continue in Week 11 versus the Jets. The Jets have given up the 29th most passing yards per game which should equate to another 300 yard performance out of Herbert. Stack up Herbert with Keenan Allen or Hunter Henry. For tournaments only feel free to take a shot at Taysom Hill and P.J. Walker who are both super cheap on FanDuel and DraftKings.

 Un hombre de 41 años, sospechoso de asesinato y canibalismo fue arrestado tras el descubrimiento de huesos humanos en un parque de Berlín, anunció la justicia el viernes.
 El detenido en prisión preventiva, es acusado de “homicidio sexual con circunstancias agravantes”, declaró la fiscalía de Berlín en un tuit, agregando sospechar “un contexto de canibalismo”.
 Según el diario Bild, el hombre arrestado es un profesor de matemáticas y ciencias físicas.
 Su presunta víctima, Stefan T., un obrero de 44 años, desapareció a principios de septiembre después de haber sido visto por última vez saliendo de su apartamento, según la policía, que había hecho un llamamiento a testigos, pero sin éxito.
 El 8 de noviembre, personas que paseaban por un parque en Pankow, al noreste de Berlín, descubrieron huesos que resultaron ser restos humanos.
 El forense identificó al desaparecido. “Sobre la base de los huesos encontrados, sin ninguna carne, y otras pruebas, sospechamos que Stefan T. fue víctima de canibalismo”, precisó un policía a Bild.
 Los investigadores también habrían incautado mensajes en un foro en línea que demostraban que los dos hombres habían acordado una cita.
 El asunto recuerda el caso de Detlev Günzel, un antiguo comisario de policía, condenado por haber matado y descuartizado, manifiestamente a petición suya, a un hombre que conoció en un sitio web de fetichistas de la antropofagia. No hay pruebas de que se haya comido a su víctima.

The only move the Marlins have made to this point is signing right-handed relief pitcher Alexander Guillen to a minor-league contract.
 But that doesn't mean the Marlins have been idly standing by. Ng, hired by the Marlins on Nov. 13 as the first female general in MLB history, has spent the past week assessing the roster she has at her disposal. She inherited a young team that is beginning to see the slew of prospects it acquired during the past three years under the Bruce Sherman and Derek Jeter ownership group reach the major-league level.
 MLB Pipeline ranks the Marlins' minor-league system as the fifth best in baseball, with 24 of the club's top 30 prospects joining the organization during the past three years. Seven of the top 10 prospects -- pitchers Sixto Sanchez, Trevor Rogers and Braxton Garrett, shortstop Jazz Chishom, first baseman Lewin Diaz and outfielders Jesus Sanchez and Monte Harrison -- made their MLB debuts in 2020.
 "It's great to have outsiders tell you where your farm system is," Ng said, "but I want to hear firsthand from the coaches that have been dealing with them, from the scouts who drafted them, from the international scouting director who signed them [to know] where we are and who these players are. That's, at this point, the nuts and bolts of the job."
 While building from within is key for a low-revenue team like the Marlins, they have pressing needs to address if they want a chance to return to the playoffs for a second consecutive season. But how far are the Marlins willing to go?
 Two of their three primary late-inning relief pitchers in Brad Boxberger and Brandon Kintzler are free agents. Do the Marlins make a splash and sign a Trevor May, Trevor Rosenthal or Brad Hand? Do they try to bring back Boxberger and/or Kintzler are lower salaries? Or do they hope in-house players such as Ryne Stanek, Jeff Brigham and Alex Vesia among others can complement Yimi Garcia in the back end of the bullpen?
 Their offense, while improved in 2020, still needs consistency and pop. They have veterans in outfielders Corey Dickerson and Starling Marte for another year (at a combined $22 million, it should be noted). Shortstop Miguel Rojas has improved at the plate, third baseman Brian Anderson is a budding star and the first base tandem of Jesus Aguilar and Garrett Cooper have high ceilings, as well. Will the Marlins be confident that their top position-player prospects will take the needed steps forward to fill out the rest of the lineup? Or will they find a mid-tier player on the market, similar to what they did last season with Matt Joyce?
 And how will balance their 40-man roster overall with any outside additions, considering 13 of the 40 spots will be held by prospects once infielder Jose Devers and outfielder Jerar Encarnacion are likely added on Friday to protect them from the Rule 5 draft?
 Only time will tell.

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday said he signed an executive order delaying when counties must certify the results from the Nov. 3 election. The state's 21 counties must certify results by Friday under current law, but Murphy's order pushes the deadline to Wednesday. Murphy, a Democrat who was not on the ballot this year, cited coronavirus concerns as the reason. “The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented difficulties for the civil servants charged with the extremely important task of certifying and auditing elections,” Murphy said in a written statement. \"This executive order will provide these dedicated officials with the time they need to properly conclude their work for this year’s general election.” It's unclear still how many counties might need to delay certification. Murphy said Ocean and Salem counties have already notified the state that they would not meet the Friday deadline. The State Department, which oversees New Jersey's elections, has not received certification from any counties yet but doesn't expect to know which counties met the Friday deadline until Monday, according to department spokesperson Alicia D'Alessandro. President-elect Joe Biden won New Jersey's 14 electoral votes handily, defeating President Donald Trump by 16 points. Sen. Cory Booker also easily defeated his Republican challenger, Rik Mehta. The closest race was in the 7th District between Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Malinowski and Republican state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. Malinowski defeated Kean by just over 1 point. The Associated Press declared Malinowski the winner on election night when he was leading Kean by double digits. The race narrowed to within a point as votes continued to be counted. On Thursday, Kean conceded defeat to...

Part of the issue with moving forward is a condition of "double trouble." First, elections have a notorious habit of causing big market swings. The 2000 election, as Ernest Carrera Tampa remembers, caused the end of the 1990s tech bubble and a related slump. The 2008 election came on the heels of the real estate bubble and dragged the economy a good five years before things returned to pre-damaged levels in 2013. All of this experience changed the game and paradigm of modern investing as Ernest Carrera Tampa watched it unfold along with many others in the investing environment. Second, the scary part has only since continued even more. The run from 2013 to 2019 has been incredible. In the space of six years, Ernest Carrera Tampa has seen more investment gain created than decades before. However, that level of volatility has every financial expert like Ernest Carrera Tampa also on edge waiting for the eventual drop as well. Yet it hasn't come yet. And that makes 2020 even more dramatic as a potential for a pivotal year going forward.

It’s still unclear if Congress will send states more federal relief before the end of the year. And already on Thursday, some of these industries were worried how they would survive without more aid.

 ## Meijer fleet wins EPA award
 GRAND RAPIDS — Meijer’s vehicle fleet received a SmartWay Excellence Award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the third straight year, according to a release from the retailer.
 The release adds the retail company’s fleet “is the only four-time recipient of the distinct honor nationwide in the mixed carrier category.”
 The SmartWay Excellence Award “recognizes the top retail and manufacturing carriers and shippers that demonstrate how their logistical operations make a measurable difference in reducing carbon emissions, while also effectively managing fuel costs as they move goods around the country,” according to the release.
 The standalone fleet comprises 250 semi-trucks and nearly 400 drivers. The release said the retailer has a total network of 750 trucks that log more than 1.3 million miles per week.
 Among the improvements Meijer has implemented are telematics to maintain quality and temperature control in refrigeration systems and backhauling measures to reduce “empty miles on the road.”

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Motorists who register an electric vehicle in Pennsylvania would have to pay an annual fee, under lame-duck session legislation approved by the state's Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday. The bill, backed by a 132-70 vote, goes to the Senate for approval. Most Republicans voted for it, while most Democrats opposed it. The provisions to impose the fee were inserted into an underlying bill just this week. The Sierra Club, which opposes the fee, said the “surprise move comes as the lame duck legislative session comes to a close, and could be fast-tracked in the Senate with minimal debate.” Opponents said it is a bad idea to impose costs on people who own electric vehicles during the climate change fight and efforts to limit greenhouse-gas exhaust from vehicles that run on gasoline. Backers of the bill, however, said it is only fair to charge people who own electric vehicles, since people who fuel their cars with gasoline are paying taxes that help build and repair roads. The fee would be $75 per year for a hybrid gas-electric vehicle, $175 a year for an electric vehicle and $275 for an electric vehicle with a weight rating of more than 26,000 pounds, such as a city bus. Policymakers have warned in recent years that more electric vehicles and more fuel-efficient vehicles on the road will eat into gas taxes that pay for road construction. Twenty-eight states have laws requiring a special registration fee for electric vehicles while 14 states impose a fee specifically on hybrids, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

ROME (AP) — The Vatican is investigating how Pope Francis’ official Instagram account “liked” a photo of a scantily-clad Brazilian model. A Vatican official said Friday the “like” didn’t originate from the Holy See, and as such, the Vatican was working “in close connection” with Instagram to get to the bottom of who liked the photo. Francis’ official Instagram account, “franciscus,” has 7.4 million followers, but doesn’t follow anyone. Earlier this month, “franciscus” was shown as having “liked” a photo of Natalia Garibotto, a Brazilian model whose Instagram account features dozens of photos of her in thong bikinis and provocative poses. In the photo liked by “franciscus,” she is dressed as an apparent schoolgirl, wearing a short tartan miniskirt and white garter stockings leaning up against a school locker. Francis has a robust social media presence, with his Twitter account “Pontifex” tweeting out daily prayers in a variety of languages.
