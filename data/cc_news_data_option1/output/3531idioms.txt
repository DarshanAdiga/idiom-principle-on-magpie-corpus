This is all fine until he doesn’t see a defender coming. His second fumble in the Bills game is a great example of this. It’s a shame because it comes on one of the most impressive plays from his rookie year. He toasts one of the league’s best cover corners, Tredavious White, off the line with a patient release and hand usage. He’s able to make the first guy miss before giving White a nasty stiff arm. The problem is the Bills, Matt Milano, is lining up a sucker punch on the ball. If you pause the GIF at the 8.25 mark you can see Johnson is carrying the ball well away from his body because he’s not expecting contact and gets it knocked free.

The Madras High Court has reserved its orders on petitions filed by retired Additional Director General of Police K. Thukkaiandi, 67, and his daughter Yamini to quash a criminal case pending against them before a Judicial Magistrate court here for having allegedly grabbed 12,000 square feet of private property at Seashore Town in Sholinganallur.
 Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan deferred his verdict after hearing arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioners as well as the prosecution. The land- grabbing wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police here had filed a charge sheet against the petitioners, the former ADGP’s wife and another woman for having allegedly indulged in cheating and forgery.
 In his quash petition, Mr. Thukkaiandi stated that, according to the prosecution, the Sholinganallur property originally belonged to one Chockalingam Mudaliyar. It was sold to Motilal Karsondas Dalal and his brother Gunvant Lal Karsondas Dalal of Mumbai in 1967. Thereafter, the first purchaser died in 1981 and his brother also died in 1993.
 Though the property ought to have been enjoyed by the legal heirs of the Dalal brothers, the retired ADGP and his family members reportedly entered into a criminal conspiracy to grab it. Two individuals were made to impersonate the Dalal brothers and a power of attorney was executed in favour of a woman in Tiruchi in April 2007.
 The woman was named as Dhanalakshmi in the power of attorney document though her real name was Tamilarasi. Subsequently, she executed a sale deed in favour of Yamini who, in turn, let out the property to a commercial establishment for a monthly rent of ₹1.53 lakh and received advance of ₹10.20 lakh.
 On coming to know of the alleged fraud, Upendra Motilal Dalal, son of Motilal Karsondas, lodged a complaint with the Greater Chennai Commissioner of Police on May 28, 2012 and a FIR was registered the very next day without naming Mr. Thukkaiandi as one of the accused.
 However, after completing the investigation last year, the police filed a charge sheet against the former police officer, his wife, daughter and Tamilarasi. The Magistrate took cognisance of the final report and issued summons directing Mr. Thukkaiandi to appear in person on February 20. Hence, he had moved the present petition.
 The prosecution’s claim was that he had misused his position as a top police officer and coerced his official driver Kaja Hussain to accompany his wife to the Neelankarai Sub- Registrar’s office for registering the forged sale deed. The retired ADGP, on his part, claimed that no other witness other than the driver had spoken about his role in the alleged crime.
 He also recalled to have taken action against former Chief Ministers and Ministers under the Prevention of Corruption Act during his stint as Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB- CID) in 1997 and then as Inspector General of Police in the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC).
 Claiming to have also monitored the trial in the disproportionate assets case against former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in Bengaluru, the former ADGP said the present land grabbing case has been “foisted” against him and his family members and that they had been roped in out of “malice and spite.”

Johnson led the Steelers in fumbles last year with 5 (T-5 in the NFL). You’d have to go all the way back to 2006 for the last time Pittsburgh had a non-QB fumble 5 or more times in a season when Willie Parker coughed it up 7 times. I’ll be the first to go on record saying I think at least 2 of Johnson’s fumbles are a little unfair.

Another thing I wanted to point out about DJ is he favors his right arm while carrying the ball. The general rule of thumb is to have the ball in your outside arm, closest to the sideline. Now, there are instances where this rule may be broken due to the defender being in between you and the sideline or you’re planning to cut back, etc. The point of this, other than your body creating the natural barrier between the defender and the ball, is it also allows you to have a “weapon” while carrying the football. The weapon being your opposite arm to keep the defender’s diving hands away with stiff arms. Below you can see numerous instances where Johnson either immediately puts the ball in his inside arm or he cuts back across the field without switching arms leaving him without a weapon as he meets the defense.

Johnson’s last 2 fumbles to go over are actually eerily similar. In both, Johnson initially jars the ball loose himself either with his knee or with the ground due to not having the ball high and tight. Then almost immediately after the bobbles, he gets a punch square on the ball from a defender. He likes to sort of chicken wing the ball perpendicular to his chest when he goes into contact rather than holding it vertically tight to his chest which is a much stronger position. The technique costs him in both instances.

The second being Johnson’s first fumble in the Buffalo game. It’s hard to place the blame on Johnson here as you have a bad snap combined with a mesh from James Conner who just returned from an injury that had him sidelined for the better part of 7 weeks, which makes you question the practice reps these two were able to get on this play. When you have two guys playing out of position, running a zone read, it’s very possible for things to get messy. Johnson gets hit before he can corral the handoff and you have another fumble.

Sullenberger has always "tried to be a voice of reason and to speak in a measured way," but he felt that he had to call out the President's behavior, he wrote. Trump has "completely failed" to uphold his oath of office and "he has admitted that he cannot comprehend the concept of service above self," the pilot wrote.
 "He cannot understand selflessness because he is selfish. He cannot conceive of courage because he is a coward. He cannot feel duty because he is disloyal," Sullenberger wrote.
 He concluded his post by arguing that "we owe it not only to those who have served and sacrificed for our nation, but to ourselves and to succeeding generations to vote him out." He posted similar comments to Twitter.
 Sullenberger became famous for his calm valor in 2009 as he successfully landed US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River in New York after its engines were knocked out by birds shortly after taking off from LaGuardia Airport. All 155 people on board survived, and Tom Hanks went on to portray the quiet, humble pilot in the 2016 film "Sully."
 Sullenberger, a graduate of the US Air Force Academy, retired from US Airways in 2010 after 30 years with the airline and served as an aviation safety expert for CBS News from 2011 to 2017. US Airways had its final flight in 2015 after it merged with American Airlines.

The only problem I have is my road is terrible so I wear tires out pretty fast. I get mud on the inside of the tires and they wear unevenly sometimes. But, that is not the cars fault. I have had two deer hit the car on the drivers side. It did some cosmetic damage, but the car held firm on the road and no passengers were injured. So, it can take a hit and keep on trucking. The last hit was pretty hard. I never hit my breaks because I didn't see it coming. So, the air bags did not deploy and were not needed. It was a large buck. Took out most of the front, drivers side. But, I'm still driving it. The insurance company says it will cost more to fix it than it is worth so that tells you the damage.
