bdquo;Am avut o perioadă &icirc;n care partea economică &icirc;mi ghida viața și tot ce făceam, făceam pentru partea economică. Mi-am dat seama că m-am neglijat foarte tare. Ajunsesem să nu mă mai cunosc și viața are un mod ciudat de a-ți da o palmă c&acirc;nd vede că o iei pe o direcție greșită. Asta mi s-a &icirc;nt&acirc;mplat și mie.

You roll around the country with your bros, stopping every once in a while to get gas, kill some monsters, go camping, or climb to the top of a volcano to take down a giant bird so you can take its giant eggs and eat them with cup noodles. It's nice.

The remoteness of this theater of operations also means nuclear strikes would have a lower risk of strategic escalation, as long as all the nuclear adversaries refrained from targeting enemy mainland.
