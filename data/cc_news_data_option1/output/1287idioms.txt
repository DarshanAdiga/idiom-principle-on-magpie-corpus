University of Maryland senior Selena Rawlley says her student newspaper is a lifeline to campus. Now that campus is closed, she’s home, separated from her classmates and friends. For this senior trying to come to terms with a college career cut short, the isolation “almost makes you feel like you’re the only one experiencing it.” However, after reading her best friend’s column about the canceled commencement, she found an article about how other members of student organizations are coping with a shortened year. When she saw the headline, crying, she “braced” herself. As she read the article, she started to feel comforted, knowing “I’m not the only one who’s disappointed.”

Consumers fearful of contracting coronavirus have been seeking to boost their immune systems the old-fashioned way: by loading up on orange juice.          Frozen concentrated orange juice, traded in New York, is the best performing of all commodities this year, according to Bloomberg data, rising 25 per cent to US$1.214 a pound since the start of January. U.S. shoppers have rushed to stock up on the shelf staple, analysts said, while fears over labour shortages in factories and transportation have also given prices a lift.          "There is plenty of orange juice around, but it's a bit like toilet paper -- there's no shortage but people have been rushing to buy it," said Neil Murray at IHS Markit's Agribusiness Intelligence.

There have been a number of great articles written in recent days about the "lost month" of February when Trump consistently downplayed the crisis even when people who understood the clear and present danger were running around the government with their hair on fire. The failure to get testing up and running in the early days will be remembered as a deadly blunder. His recent lurch from a promise to end all public health mitigation strategies by Easter and relaunch the economy to predicting the deaths of 100,000 to 200,000 people has been dizzying.

"That doesn't mean that all of those people will be brought out to local hotels in the community. It means we'll work with the government of Guam, the Guam Hotel and Restaurant Association, and within our fence lines to appropriately house all of those sailors within (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines."          About 40 medical professionals from the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force Medical Battalion will arrive in the next day or two. They will help the carrier sailors, build capacity at Naval Hospital and backstop capacity within the government Guam.          "The biggest reassurance I can give you is that all the sailors being transferred off Naval Base Guam ... into Tumon will have a negative COVID-19 test," Menoni said, adding the sailors will be monitored by military security around the clock for the 14 days.          Aquilino said the military has been in discussion with the governor as they work toward the capacity to isolate and quarantine.          “There’s never been an intent to take all of the sailors off the ship. If that ship needed to respond to a crisis today, we would respond.”          National media reported that some of the sailors had been housed in a gym on the Navy base and were sleeping on cots.          The 7th Fleet commander held the press conference after the San Francisco Chronicle first reported of a letter written by Capt. Brett Crozier indicating 100 sailors on the aircraft carrier had been infected with the coronavirus and described the spread of the disease as “accelerating.”          “Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure. ... This is a necessary risk,” the warship's captain wrote, in the letter published by the San Francisco Chronicle. “Keeping over 4,000 young men and women on board the (Theodore Roosevelt) is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those sailors entrusted to our care.”          When the first group of sailors on the Theodore Roosevelt fell ill to COVID-19, some were airlifted to Naval Hospital Guam for immediate assessment and care, and the aircraft carrier eventually pulled into port on Guam on March 28.          The average age of the ship's sailors is in the early 20s. While they're not immune, Aquilino said, "I'm very happy that, No. 1, the health of the force that we take to sea plays in our favor, and the age overall of the force also plays in our favor."          In Wednesday's press conference, Aquilino said the possibility exists that the contagion occurred during the aircraft carrier’s recent port visit in Vietnam in early March, but an analysis is underway.          "The Navy is no different than the rest of our people in the United States, and we are susceptible the same as anyone. The focus on the health and care of the force is what I am spending pretty much 23 hours a day on to ensure that the ship, the strike group, the 7th Fleet all have exactly what they need to execute this plan," Aquilino stated. "At the end of this plan, we will spit out a warfighting aircraft carrier just so we're all aligned. We will execute missions if need be today in time of crisis."

Anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine should only be used to treat COVID-19 in clinical trials or in case of "national emergency", the European Medicine Agency warned Wednesday.           Around the world, countries are expanding access to the two compounds, which are used to treat malaria and are known to have anti-viral properties.          The medicines have shown early promise against the COVID-19 illness in early studies in France and China.          But the EMA cautioned that the drugs should not be used to treat COVID-19 cases unless absolutely necessary.          "It is very important that patients and healthcare professionals only use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for their authorised uses or as part of clinical trials or national emergency-use programmes for the treatment of COVID-19," it said.          Both drugs have a number of potentially serious side effects, especially when taken in high doses or administered in tandem with other medications.          "They must not be used without a prescription and without supervision by a doctor; prescriptions should not be given outside their authorised uses except in the setting of a clinical trial or nationally agreed protocols," the EMA said in a statement.           There are also fears of shortages particularly of chloroquine, the less risky of the two medicines that is also used to treat arthritis.           Several countries are conducting clinical trials for the drugs as part of their campaigns to quell the COVID-19pandemic.

On Feb. 5, the cruise ship Diamond Princess quarantined thousands of passengers after a major outbreak on board. Mitt Romney announced that he’d vote to convict Trump on one of the two counts against him, and the Senate voted to acquit on both.          If the Senate had approved additional impeachment witnesses, the trial would have at least stretched further into February, overlapping even more with the epidemic.          Trump closed off travel from China while the trial was still ongoing, the day after senators asked their final questions of the impeachment managers and the White House defense team. Only two and a half weeks after the trial, the White House requested $1.25 billion in emergency coronavirus funding from Congress.          If the trial hadn’t ended expeditiously, the Senate easily could have been still seeking the testimony of, say, former White House counsel Don McGahn about the details of the non-firing of special counsel Robert Mueller—at the same time everyone expected the administration to be shifting into wartime footing against the virus.          In that circumstance, the impeachment trial obviously would have been immediately shelved, because a discretionary national crisis can’t compete with a real, unavoidable one. Political melodrama must give way to a potential public-health catastrophe. Purportedly historic events that were going to be forgotten within weeks can’t compare to days that genuinely might define our era.          For more than three years, American national politics has been constantly on a crisis footing over presidential tweets, two-day controversies, dubious storylines whipped up by the media and Trump’s genuine outrages. Little of it has been enduring, or nearly as important as the intense, wall-to-wall attention at any given moment suggested.

As the situation continues to unfold, misinformation rolls out much like the unending waves beneath them. Reports leak out to various outlets and posts whiz through social media channels.          One of those, Broadus says, concerns the four deaths reported on the ship — but, she notes, not all are being attributed to the virus.          “We learned this from a crew member: One (death) from COVID, one from a heart attack, one from a tragic fall in the shower and another by an unknown cause. This is not what national news is reporting ... not all four died from COVID,” she said.          The Broaduses remain unshaken, even with the knowledge that death has touched their ship. As frequent travelers, the thought of traversing the course with deceased passengers in tow is not entirely unfamiliar.          “This is not the first time we’ve been on a cruise that has lost passengers. Since cruising is popular with a senior demographic, it happens. All large ships have a morgue, a morbid thought, I know,” she said.          The Rotterdam is currently situated in the sea beside the Zaandam. In spite of the dire situation, the Broaduses feel the company is doing its best during these very difficult circumstances.          “I am confident every effort is been made to take care of remaining guests and control the disease spreading. Holland America has been very vigilant during this difficult time ... it’s very important to note that. There’s a lot of false narratives out there,” Broadus said.          The couple remains in good spirits despite not having stepped onto dry land in 18 days. They are passing the time with books, cards and Yahtzee, as well as movies and television.          “We are trying to stay positive, keep busy, stay in touch with friends and stay healthy. Sanitation is key to everything we do. We now have masks,” she said.          “Thankfully, I brought a lot of wet wipes, which have really been helpful with infection control in our room especially with food trays.”          The Broaduses have been told that they are heading for the Columbian island of San Andreas, which is in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, with plans to resupply the ship via an air drop at some point.          “That is how heroic the efforts now are,” she said.          They are hoping that rumors on board the ship are true and that they will soon head to Fort Lauderdale or Cape Canaveral, where they can disembark and finally head home. The cruise line, however, has declined to announce any plans until they are set in stone. In recent reports, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was firmly resistant to the idea.          According to The Associated Press, DeSantis says it would be “a mistake” to bring the passengers from Holland America’s Zaandaam onshore for treatment because South Florida already has a high number of new coronavirus infections and that rate is growing. He said the area’s hospital beds need to be saved for residents and not “foreign nationals.”          While the Broaduses remain in limbo, the two are incredibly grateful for their health.          “Our mental health is fine. We are healthy,” she said.”We have a good network of fellow passengers who we chat with regularly, vent, and share some laughs as we are all in the same boat, pardon the pun. We still don’t know when we will get home. It’s the not knowing that is the hardest thing.”

With COVID-19 pushing classes online, Staub created a tutorial on how to use this tool which was picked up by the Texas Association of Community Colleges and shared to their website to help instructors across the state.          “Since I am familiar with the platform, I felt it was a way I could help in an extremely stressful time,” Staub said.          “The biggest challenges I am facing involve trying to help the second-year students cope with the disappointment and fear of the unknown. I want to give them clear answers and tell them everything will be okay, but I honestly don’t have answers. The sonography students have to take registries to secure a job, but all of the testing centers closed. This last part of the semester is when many of them would be offered jobs, but now that time has been robbed from them. Lots of tears were shed.”          The college’s Associate Degree Nursing program has faced similar challenges with clinical sites being shut down and instructors left to figure out new ways for students to meet course objectives in a distance education format.          Dr. Tola Plusnick, program director for WC’s new Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing program, said nursing accrediting bodies are being proactive and allowing more clinical requirements to be offered via simulation. Students are downloading an app that allows them to record themselves performing skills such as patient interviews and exams with their household members.          “Overall, I think things are going well,” Plusnick said. “I am beyond proud of our students who are eager to continue their education and to get out into the workforce to help combat this and any future threats to the healthcare of our community, country and world.”          While the nursing program had access to pre-created online simulation tools, the reality was different in Piehl’s Respiratory Care program. Since the profession is much smaller than nursing there are not as many virtual simulation options, so the instructors developed their own.          Piehl credited the college’s advanced planning, allowing instructors to be proactive and take home equipment in order to record lectures and simulated labs from their homes. She said the department is working to record their labs quickly since there may be a local need to use WC’s ventilators.          “The students’ knowledge base will not be compromised,” Piehl said. “When we are able to return to the college, we will set aside a great deal of time for the students to practice these skills in the lab before we begin rendering care to patients in the hospitals.”          In addition to instructors preparing for a new normal, the college’s Technology Services Department has worked tirelessly the past few weeks to reconfigure computer labs and created a new testing lab in order to maintain social distancing for students without computer or Internet access in their homes. They also worked over Spring Break to distribute laptops to WC employees in need and are developing Wi-Fi hot spots so students can access the college’s network from their vehicles in campus parking lots.          Likewise, members of maintenance and sanitation vendor CBRE have worked to disinfect the campus and will clean the student computer labs each day to make sure they are safe.          “As stressful as this situation has been and even with the enormity of the threat that has driven us to make these sudden and drastic changes, I could not be prouder or feel better about this college than I do today,” said Mike Endy, vice president of instruction and student services. “There’s always been a lot to feel good about at Weatherford College. Most of that has been because of our people. Today, robbed of the trappings we have come to rely on to do our jobs, they have made it crystal clear. They are Weatherford College and they have every right to be proud and feel good about it.”

U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories surged last week while demand fell sharply and refineries throttled back activity in response to a sharp falloff in fuel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.          Crude inventories rose by 13.8 million barrels in the week to March 27 to 469.2 million barrels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. That was the biggest one-week rise since 2016, and analysts expect stocks to keep rising as refineries curb output and gasoline demand falls.          State governments have issued orders trying to halt the spread of the virus, and many residents are staying out of cars. Gasoline demand fell by the most ever in one week, with products supplied, a proxy for demand, dropping by 2.2 million barrels per day to 6.7 million bpd. That augurs for more refining cutbacks down the road.          "Demand is a disaster," said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. "We have a ways to go before these numbers bottom out - this is going to be the way the next few reports are and it will drag on this way for quite some time."          Refinery crude runs fell by 940,000 bpd last week, the EIA said. Refinery utilization rates fell by 5 percentage points on the week to 82.3% of operable capacity, the lowest rate since September 2017.          "For refiners, the rate they're producing is as low as it can go for a number of them," said Ryan Kaup, commodities broker at CHS Hedging.          Oil prices were lower after the EIA report. U.S. crude futures dropped 31 cents to $20.17 a barrel as of 10:49 a.m. ET (1449 GMT) while Brent was down $1.35, or 5%, to $24.99 a barrel.          Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 3.5 million barrels in the last week, EIA said.          U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 7.5 million barrels to 246.8 million barrels, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.9 million-barrel rise.​          Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 2.2 million barrels in the week, versus expectations for a 1 million-barrel rise, the EIA data showed. Diesel demand has held up better than motor gasoline because many Americans are having products delivered to homes.          Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 625,000 bpd last week, EIA said.

At the turn of the last century, Dayton was a bastion of innovation. It was the proud home of the Wright brothers. NCR was headquartered here. My dad worked in the Mead building downtown.          Then NCR moved away. So did Mead and many other businesses. The elementary school I attended was torn down years ago. Good Samaritan Hospital, where I was born, closed last year. None of my close childhood friends lives in Dayton.          Dayton always has been overshadowed by two cities roughly an hour away. Cincinnati has the Reds, the Bengals and two high-profile college basketball programs. Columbus has Ohio State and has become an economic and population magnet for the rest of the state.          Dayton, though, has a feisty resolve, and it’s in the midst of a modest comeback.          Then last year, the city endured two major tragedies. On Memorial Day, at least 15 tornadoes swept through the area. The damage remains visible from I-75, the freeway that cuts through the city.          Two months later, on Aug. 4, a gunman outside Ned Peppers bar in the trendy Oregon District went on a shooting rampage, killing nine people in 32 seconds. Several UD basketball players escaped the scene.          Even before the season, the Flyers knew they were playing for more than themselves.          “We knew that after the tornadoes and shooting happened, we had to lift the community up,” junior guard Jalen Crutcher said. “There was nothing that could lift them up but basketball because they love basketball here in Dayton.”

The backing arrangement was equally urgent, a colossal blend of jazz evoking Afrocentric stalwarts like Sonny Sharrock, Brother Ah, and the New York Art Quartet. There’s a palpable weight to the music of Irreversible Entanglements; their sound hits with an earth-shattering force. That can cut both ways: Thanks to musicians like Robert Glasper and Kamasi Washington, who blend jazz with more marketable genres like hip-hop and R&B, jazz is once again considered a viable genre in the mainstream marketplace. But for a sonically ambitious band like Irreversible Entanglements, you either love the music or don’t like it at all. It takes a patient ear to absorb the band’s work; their songs are sprawling (sometimes clocking in at over 20 minutes long), mixing various subgenres of jazz along the way. The results are always compelling. “We take the ugliest parts of the world and make them beautiful,” Stewart told _The Fader_ in February. Yet they’re able to do it without tapping into clichés. Through their frank critiques of political violence and organized religion, the band achieves something deeper and more emotional. Theirs is an artful blend of raw lyrical emotion and exquisite musicianship.

Many of South Florida's cruise ships are registered in the Bahamas, where hospital capacity is limited and people are still recovering from last year's Hurricane Dorian.                  The rules, which apply to any vessel carrying more than 50 people, were issued in a March 29 safety bulletin signed by Coast Guard Rear Admiral E.C. Jones, whose district includes Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Puerto Rico.                  Dozens of cruise ships are either lined up at Port Miami and Port Everglades or waiting offshore due to the coronavirus pandemic. Most have only crew aboard, but the Carnival Corp., which owns nine cruise lines with a total of 105 ships, notified the SEC Tuesday that it has more than 6,000 passengers still at sea.

Forty-five-year-old Bradly Hart arrived on Guam from the Philippines hours before the governor announced the first confirmed COVID-19 case on island. He has been stranded here since.          The Guam Daily Post first reported on Hart in mid-March. Now, some good Samaritans have launched a GoFundMe campaign to help Hart fly to San Diego, where he has some family.          Frank Lujan is the organizer of the campaign. He read Hart's story and shared it with his fiancée, Liza Camacho. Their friends and family have been assisting Hart with food and some essentials.          The most surprising thing to Lujan when he contacted Hart was the man's attitude.          "He was actually pretty upbeat for the situation he was in. ... But I think over here in the past few days, we text back and forth, and he did say he's starting to lose hope. So that's what got me to start the GoFundMe page," Lujan said. "It's a hard time for everyone. ... At least we can get him to his family and be in a house and be sheltered."          Lujan is also one of many residents who have been furloughed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but he said his family is doing OK. He works for a great company, Lujan added.          "I know it's really rough for everyone. For my family as well," Lujan said. "If enough of us give just a little bit, we can create a great impact and help (Hart) out. It doesn't have to be a lot – $5 or $10. If enough of us get together and give a little bit, it has a huge impact for him."

Navis CRM, a Bend-based technology company specializing in hospitality services, said it has laid off about a third of its workforce in Central Oregon due to operating challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic.          The company laid off 47 of its 164 employees in Central Oregon, according to Wade Tibke, a spokesperson for the company.          “The hospitality industry faces unparalleled challenges in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which has eliminated virtually all demand for travel, hotels, and vacation rental properties,” Tibke said in a statement. “As a result, the Navis leadership team had to make one of the hardest decisions in the company’s 30-years history and reduce our workforce.”          Most of the layoffs occurred in sales, marketing and the call center. Tibke said the company is ready to rehire workers when travel becomes safer and demand returns to the industry.          The decision to make the cuts was announced to clients in emails Friday, sent by the company’s CEO Kyle Buehner.          “In order for Navis to survive the challenges ahead, we must align our costs with current revenue so that we emerge from this crisis on our feet — and continue to support our customers when demand returns,” Beuhner wrote. “Rest assured we are in hospitality for the long haul.”

As schools remain closed and teachers provide learning materials for parents and guardians to use at home, superintendents across the state are gearing up for the future may hold.          Superintendent Scott Karaptian of Pentwater Public School said, “As I think we can all agree, these are very unusual and uncharted times that none of us have ever had any experience dealing with. I also believe that all districts not only within Oceana County, but across the state and country, are doing their very best to try and keep students educationally engaged, while trying to meet their social and emotional needs as well as providing all student meals during these mandated school closings.          “As for Pentwater, our staff is continuously sharing as many educational resources and activities as possible through our website, social media sites and our mobile app. We are not currently doing any virtual or online classrooms, but some staff may be connecting virtually to answer questions or to just touch base and keep relationships intact during these very difficult times. As for the long-term plan, we expect to be hearing from the state Superintendent, Dr. Michael Rice and Governor Whitmer this week. Superintendents within the West Shore Educational Service District (WSESD) which includes Baldwin, G2S, Hart, Ludington, Mason County Central, Mason County Eastern, Pentwater, Shelby and Walkerville along with the Manistee Area Public Schools superintendent have been meeting daily through video conferencing. We discuss the continuing situation, how it is affecting our districts and how we can continue to work together to serve our students, staff and communities as best as we possibly can.”          Hart Public Schools Superintendent Mark Platt said, “It certainly is uncharted territory for the whole state. In these first few weeks we had focused on staying connected with the students and families through a variety of different ways. The other major focus was providing food. In the beginning, we all knew the governor would extend until April 13. This is because a large portion of the state goes on spring break a week later than us. Because the governor shut down all schools at the same time, it is my opinion that she would have to reopen every school at the same time and then give every school the same end of year date. The real issue, however, is between the governor and the Michigan Department of Education (MDE). The MDE has gone on record as saying that online school for the remainder of the year is not an option. While the governor does not like their position, MDE has taken the position that there is an equity issue regarding virtual learning. Not all students would have equal access to education, either due to the lack of devices, or internet access. My personal opinion is it is too early to call off school. Lansing should wait and see if we can come back April 27 and run the school year to June 12 or 19.”

Il mio volo è costato 185 Euro, credo che sia un prezzo fuori mercato, il doppio di una tariffa che si trovava in tempi normali. Per quanto riguarda i voli, la forte scontistica di cui parlavano le istituzioni non l'ho riscontrata. A me è andata bene, ma tante persone sono rimaste bloccate, volevano tornare ma non ricevevano nessuna risposta dall'ambasciata. Queste persone si sono organizzate per conto proprio, hanno creato dei gruppi su facebook e whatsapp organizzandosi i modi più impensabili per tornare.

Dew Drop Brumley Rowlett was already a legend before her playing days on the hardwood were complete.
 Rowlett was a force on the Itawamba Agricultural High School’s girls basketball team in the late 1920s. She helped lay the groundwork for the program to become one of the most successful teams in the country during the late ‘30s. By that time, she was coaching at Murray High School in Murray, Kentucky.
 After a highly successful playing career at IAHS, Freed-Hardeman College, Murray State and AAU ball, Rowlett spent the rest of her life as a coach and advocate for women’s sports.
 Even the name she went by, “Dew Drop,” came about during her high school days, according to Rowlett herself. In interviews over the years, she said fans would yell “do drop it in” wanting her to score. Folks started calling her “Dew Drop,” and the name stuck.
 Rowlett began her collegiate career at Freed-Hardeman College from 1930 to 32, where she was named to the Mississippi Valley Conference all-tournament team in 1930, 1931 and 1932. She was named tournament most valuable player in back- to-backs years beginning in 1931.
 Rowlett then joined the team at Murray State University, where she proved almost impossible to guard. In those days, it wasn’t unusual for a team to score a low number of points in a game and win. Rowlett often scored that many points, at least on her own. According to reports, she averaged 22 points a game and even scored 45 against the University of Louisville in her only season of play. Murray State didn’t field a woman’s team again until 1970. If the numbers from that era were recognized, she would be No. 2 all-time on the most points in a single game list.
 Rowlett also played softball and tennis for the Racers until she graduated.
 While at Murray State, Rowlett also played for the Red Wings, an Amateur Athletic Union {AAU} team based in Tupelo. Rowlett, her sister, and Margaret Wade, the woman who led Delta State to three state national titles, were all on the team. All three played important roles in the growth of women’s sports.
 The 1934 Red Wings advanced to the national AAU tournament that season. Rowlett played outstanding basketball for a team that went 30-3-1, earning All-Southern and All-American honors. At this time, it was the equivalent of today’s All-American honors. Women’s sports at the collegiate level were in the early days on the long road to get college athletic programs to include women’s sports.
 Rowlett began a 30-year teaching and coaching career at Murray High School in 1936, where she coached tennis and track and field.
 She made the move to coaching at the college level in 1965 coaching tennis. In 1971, she began a stint as the head coach of the newly re-established Racers before returning to Freed-Hardeman to re-establish their women’s program where she was named the Volunteer State Athletic Conference Coach of the Year in 1980. She retired in 1981 back to her home in Kentucky to golf.
 Rowlett is recognized as a founder of the Kentucky Women’s Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
 In 1985, Rowlett became the first woman selected to the Freed-Hardeman Athletic Hall of Fame. Her sister joined her a year later. In 1993, Rowlett was inducted into the Murray State University Athletic Hall of Fame.
 Rowlett’s numbers on the court were impressive, but her lifelong work in promoting opportunities for women and girls in sports is her lasting legacy.

Poet/vocalist Camae Ayewa (who releases solo work as Moor Mother), saxophonist Keir Neuringer, and bassist Luke Stewart performed together in 2015 at the Musicians Against Police Brutality rally in New York, which was organized after Gurley’s killing. After the performance, the trio added trumpeter Aquiles Navarro and drummer Tcheser Holmes, both of whom also performed at the event. Then the quintet converged on a Brooklyn recording studio soon after and played together for the first time. The result was _Irreversible Entanglements_ , an aggressive blast of screeching horns, volcanic drum fills, and surging bass, tied together by Ayewa’s scathing indictments of the police, American politics, capitalism, and racism. The album they recorded, released in 2017, was very much of the moment: Black people were angry, and rightfully so. For too long, they’d seen their peers murdered by law enforcement without justice, while living in a country that cashes in on black culture but doesn’t pay any respect to black people. The band harnessed that rage into four songs, each one brimming with barbed lyrics. “Sometimes you can get lost in the rhythm of oppression,” Ayewa declares on “Chicago to Texas,” the album’s combustible opener. “The way they beat it into you, carve trees in your back, choke you out, fetishize your flesh.”

But the lifestyles of the rich and famous are not characterized by self-sufficiency, and the luxury of mobility is cold comfort against nature’s imposition of both contagious illness and a rapidly encroaching climate crisis. This has always been the ominous truth underlying the apparent security of the ruling classes, who rely on the labor of others to produce their conditions of affluence. As geographer David Harvey writes, “In the cholera epidemics of the nineteenth century, the transcendence of barriers of class was sufficiently dramatic as to spawn the birth of a public sanitation and health movement (which became professionalized) that has lasted to this day.” Public health emerged as a result of this dawning recognition that belonging to a society, including one starkly divided by class, puts even those at the top at risk. For wealthy individuals to make sure they, and only they, are safe, the threat will remain, lurking around every corner.

“This will all enhance and benefit our program in the future,” Piehl said. “The creative process, while challenging, has been exhilarating and at times, quite enjoyable.”          The transition to fully online began more than a month ago as college administrators began monitoring the COVID-19 situation and advised instructors to prepare for the potential change. Since all of WC’s classes, including face-to-face courses, have an online presence via the Canvas learning management system, this transition was not as difficult as it could have been.          “All of the full-time humanities instructors have taught at least one online course in the past, but we do have some faculty with more experience; so, those individuals have really contributed by commenting on both curriculum and technology,” said Dr. Dana Brewer, Humanities Department chair. “This is a strong, dedicated group of individuals, and we are all supporting each other.”          Similarly, departments across the college have spent the past two weeks conducting meetings via email or videoconference, sharing ideas about how to make this transition a success and developing creative solutions for labs, exams and lectures.          “The main point we want people to remember is to be patient with themselves and each other,” said Dr. Sarah Lock, associate dean of dual credit and eLearning. “This is a stressful time, and moving a face-to-face course into an online environment with a couple weeks’ notice is not the same thing as building an online course from the ground up. I am so honored to have colleagues who are creative and smart and dedicated to helping students succeed.”          While many faculty members have experience teaching courses online, there are others for whom this is a new adventure and their peers were quick to assist.          “We were able to pull a list of seasoned instructors and some really well-built classrooms that could be used for those instructors who did not have content currently,” said Cheryl Rodriguez, the college’s Canvas administrator. “Once we had that information, we were ready to jump in and start making it a reality.”          That reality includes long days with upwards of 200 emails hitting Rodriguez’s inbox along with phone calls and Skype meetings.          “We are prioritizing requests and dealing with the most critical first,” she said. “I can say that at the end of the day, which might be the evening, we have addressed every single request so far. I believe we are in a good position to help students when they start experiencing the new normal on Monday.”          One faculty member with experience in online lecture is Kelly Staub, sonography program clinical coordinator, who has used Screencast-O-Matic to record and share her lectures with students on Canvas for the past two years allowing students to relisten to lectures as needed.

An 81-year-old man who contracted COVID-19 died at Guam Memorial Hospital midday Wednesday.          “I told you that Guam must prepare itself for more days of sadness,” said Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero. “Unfortunately, one more of Guam’s COVID-19-positive patients passed away at 11:58 am.”          The patient was admitted to GMH on March 26.          The governor said he suffered from multiple health problems, including diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.          “To his family and those who knew him, you have our deepest condolences,” she said following a brief moment of silence at Adelup.          On Tuesday, a 79-year-old man died at the hospital from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. His death came just over a week after the virus claimed the life of 68-year-old Dorothea Jesus.          As of April 1, 77 people tested positive for COVID-19 on Guam, including the three deaths. Eight new cases announced Wednesday evening increased the total.          Six of the patients were tested through the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego. The results were given to the Department of Public Health and Social Services by U.S. Naval Hospital Guam.          Eight had traveled to the Philippines, two to the U.S. mainland, one from Hawaii, one from Japan and one from Singapore, according to the profiles released by the Joint Information Center. Fifty-four had no travel history. The breakdown doesn't include the additional eight new cases announced at close to 10 p.m. Wednesday.          Nine have since recovered and 65 remain in isolation, according to the information center.          “We are not out of the woods – far from it,” Leon Guerrero said. “We will continue to see the number of cases increase, and unfortunately we must be prepared for more deaths. I am honest with you because saving lives depends not on just the government’s actions – it depends on all of you.”

Italian MotoGP rider Andrea Iannone has been banned for 18 months after testing positive for anabolic steroids, the international motorcycling federation (FIM) announced on Wednesday.          Iannone, 30, tested positive in a urine sample collected at an in-competition test at the Malaysian MotoGP in Sepang on November 3.          An FIM disciplinary hearing imposed a ban from December 17, 2019 to June 16, 2021.          Iannone's team Aprilia said they would be appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) as the FIM had recognised the possibility of food contamination.          "On the one hand they recognise my innocence, because they speak of involuntary contamination, but we lost because I was sentenced," Iannone told Sky Sport Italia.           "But it could have been worse, now we will immediately resort to CAS to try to get back in the saddle as soon as possible."          Iannone was disqualified from the final two rounds of the 2019 season in Malaysia and Valencia, but remained 16th in the standings on 43 points, as he failed to finish both races.          "The sentence leaves us baffled by the punishment imposed on Andrea but also very satisfied," Aprilia Racing CEO Massimo Rivola said in a statement.          "The judges recognised Andrea's total good faith in confirming the thesis of food contamination.           "We want Andrea riding his Aprilia RS-GP, we will be at his side until the end and we will support him in his appeal."          Iannone joined Aprilia last season following two years with Suzuki.

The Dow Jones tumbled more than 700 points on Wednesday as investors fled to safe-haven assets after new orders for U.S.-made goods plunged to an 11-year low and private payrolls fell for the first time since 2017.          The blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 ended Tuesday with their worst opening quarters in history as efforts to contain the virus resulted in deserted shopping streets, massive staff furloughs and a halt in business activity.          Meanwhile, the collapse in oil prices brought about its first major casualty with Whiting Petroleum filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Its shares slumped 42%.          "There is no easy way to quantify either the economic shutdown or what the eventual recovery is going to look like as the monetary and fiscal policy initiatives are as historic as the economic decline," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.          Companies on the benchmark index have lost more than $5.6 trillion in market value so far this year, despite trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus that helped equity markets claw back some of the sharp declines last week.          On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Americans of a "painful" two weeks ahead, with White House health officials modeling an enormous jump in virus-related deaths even with strict social distancing measures.          U.S. real estate, utilties and consumer staples stocks, which had held up so far as they are considered stable during times of extreme volatility, fell between 1% and 6.7%.          Goldman Sachs now expects sequential real U.S. GDP to plummet 34% in the second quarter on an annualized basis, foreshadowing a deep economic slump.          "Talk of a bottom in equity markets still seems remarkably premature given the continued increase in infection and death rates across Europe and the United States," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London.          With the quarterly reporting season set to begin in two weeks, S&P 500 companies are expected to enter an earnings recession in 2020, falling 3.7% in the first quarter and 9.6% in the second.          At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 658.21 points, or 3.00%, at 21,258.95, the S&P 500 was down 82.63 points, or 3.20%, at 2,501.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 213.20 points, or 2.77%, at 7,486.90.          Interest-rate sensitive stocks on the banking index fell 5%, while airlines, hotels and cruise operators shed between 5% and 7%.          The energy sector shed another 3%, with experts now saying oil prices could touch single digits, exacerbated by a share tussle among top producers as the world runs out of storage space.          Declining issues outnumbered advancers more than 13-to-1 on the NYSE and 6-to-1 on the Nasdaq.          The S&P index recorded no new 52-week high and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded four new highs and 32 new lows.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. manufacturing activity contracted less than expected in March, but disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic pushed new orders received by factories to an 11-year low, reinforcing economists' views that the economy was in recession.          The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 49.1 last month from 50.1 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dropping to 45.0 in March.          A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. The smaller-than-expected drop in the ISM index reflected a rise in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 65.0 this month from 57.3 in February.          A lengthening in suppliers' delivery time is normally associated with increased activity, which would be a positive contribution. In this case, however, slower supplier deliveries indicate supply shortages rather than stronger demand.          More than half of the country is in some form of lockdown as states and local governments try to contain the spread of the coronavirus, bringing the nation to an abrupt stop. The United States has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, with nearly 164,000 people infected. At least 3,024 people in the U.S. have died from the illness, according to a Reuters tally.          As well as causing disruptions in supply chains, the pandemic has shut down demand, with the transportation industry almost crawling to a halt, and restaurants, bars and other social venues shuttering.          The government reported last week that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rocketed to a record 3.28 million in the week ending March 21.          The grim economic picture has forced the Federal Reserve to take extraordinary measures, and President Donald Trump last Friday signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package. Economists believe the economy is already in recession.          The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a decline in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.          The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to a reading of 42.2 in March, the lowest since March 2009, from 49.8 in February. Manufacturers also reported paying less for raw materials and other inputs. The survey's measure of prices paid fell to 37.4, the lowest since January 2016, from a reading of 45.9 in February.          The ISM's factory employment index decreased to a reading of 43.8 last month, the lowest since May 2009, from 46.9 in February. That supports economists' views that the longest employment boom in U.S. history, which started in October 2010, came to an end in March. The government will publish its closely followed employment report for March on Friday. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

Michigan has been one of the hardest hit states and Detroit and surrounding communities are at the epicenter. On Tuesday, state health officials confirmed 7,615 coronavirus cases and 259 deaths.          In an effort to slow the migration of the virus, everything from schools to auto plans to shopping malls and dine-in restaurants have temporarily closed for the foreseeable future. State officials say they expect the peak of confirmed infections is still a few weeks off.          The Roseville-based, family-owned eatery has 16 locations in southeast Michigan, including nine in Macomb County. A new location has been under construction on Utica Road near 15 Mile Road in Fraser. It was scheduled to open this month, but that has been placed on hold.          Giftos concluded by saying he looks forward to being back in business "when it is safe to do so in the coming weeks."

The nearly 5,000 sailors serving on the COVID-19-stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt are the sons, daughters, siblings, parents and spouses of families across the United States, including Guam.          So when the Navy asked Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero to allow many of the aircraft carrier's sailors to be quarantined in certain Guam hotels – at least those who haven't yet been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 – the governor made the right call.          The governor on Wednesday announced she's OK with the use of certain Guam hotels for accommodations for the warship's sailors who haven't been infected with the pneumonia-like disease.          The Navy made the request after the warship's captain made the plea to move the majority of the sailors off the ship in light of the reported rapid rise of COVID-19 cases on the aircraft carrier, which pulled into the Guam port last week after a visit to Vietnam.          It wasn't an easy decision, the governor acknowledged, but as long as the Navy abides by the restrictions to ensure the sailors will not be allowed into the local community, Leon Guerrero felt it is Guam's obligation to also provide a place for the warship's crew to wait out the 14-day quarantine in a humane facility.          The restrictions include:          • Keeping infected sailors isolated within the military facilities;          • Testing each sailor and making sure he or she is free of the disease before the transfer to quarantine-designated hotels;          • Conducting daily medical checkups at the quarantine areas;          • The military providing security on every floor and at all points of entry at the hotels;          • Using only hotels that are currently empty;          • Keeping beaches off-limits for the sailors as it is for the general public as well; and          • The military providing personal protective gear to any hotel worker who is a part of the hotel staff during the quarantine.          And to ensure Guam's strained health care system does not get the additional weight of caring for service members, the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force will send about 40 medical professionals into Guam to take care of the sailors and help enhance the capabilities at Naval Hospital Guam.          The Navy has also announced there will be layers of security provided by the military to ensure the sailors who will be quarantined in Guam hotels will not sneak into the local community.          "I know there will be a small chorus of cynics who will oppose this position, but now is not the time for the 'us vs. them.' While there are sailors on board that ship from every corner of the nation, some of those sailors call Guam home," the governor said. "They sat at King's with friends on a Friday night. They graduated from places like Simon Sanchez High School and George Washington. They are our nieces, our nephews, our sons, our daughters, and grandsons and granddaughters, and we can protect Guam while being humane to them," the governor added. "That is the Guam I know, and we will not abandon who we are out of fear. Every decision we make during this pandemic is made – and will continue to be made – with the health and safety of our people in mind."          In light of Guam's continuing rise in COVID-19 cases, GovGuam's decision to let the aircraft carrier's sailors into Guam hotels is a risk and a sacrifice the island community is making.          We hope the military leadership at the Guam level, at the Pacific Fleet in Honolulu and the main decision-makers at the Pentagon will see and remember the kindness Guam has shown.          We hope the military will reciprocate our community's gesture with transparency, candor and respect for local rules, traditions and sensitivities.          We know from a recent incident the military doesn't always see Guam as a partner.          Not long ago, Guam Army National Guard and Reserve families felt hurt when the Navy restricted Guardsmen and reservists who aren't on active-duty from buying essential items on the Navy base exchange and commissary stores on weekdays – amid a run on supplies in stores outside the base fence. The restriction was lifted after the Navy base leadership was called out.          There will be times when the military's sincerity to work with the local community will be tested.          And when that happens, they need to remember the risk Guam took by standing with them today – and in many other challenging times in the past for our country.

NUEVA DELHI (AP) — Estaban hambrientos. Algunos no habían comido en varios días. Otros sobrevivían a base de agua y galletas. Pero de todos modos caminaron cientos de millas, familias enteras, hombre y mujeres, niños y ancianos, a lo largo de carreteras desiertas. Algunos apenas si tenían chanclas en sus pies. Otros llevaban bolsas en sus cabezas. Varios padres llevaban a sus hijos en sus hombros. En la última semana, los trabajadores migrantes --el principal sector de la fuerza laboral de la India-- se han marchado de las ciudades, paralizadas por el coronavirus, y regresado a sus pueblos, generando el temor de que el virus se pueda esparcir más rápidamente por el interior. Fue un éxodo como no se veía en la India desde su partición en 1947, cuando se fueron los ingleses y el país fue dividido en dos, uno de mayoría hindú (India) y otro predominantemente musulmán (Pakistán). Una orden de confinamiento de 21 días hizo que los 1.300 millones de indios se queden en sus casas, con excepción de aquellos que desempeñan labores esenciales, como los empleados de supermercados y de farmacias. El confinamiento más grande del mundo dio paso a una crisis humanitaria. Millones de trabajadores pobres viven en casuchas precarias en barrios muy congestionados. Al no tener ingresos ni ahorros por la paralización de actividades, se ven obligados a regresar a sus pueblos. Pero los trenes no funcionan, los taxis son demasiado costosos y no hay suficientes autobuses, a pesar de que se reforzó ese servicio. Por ello no les queda otro remedio que caminar. El gobierno dice que entre 500.000 y 600.000 migrantes regresaron a sus pueblos a pie. Al agravarse la crisis, las autoridades trataron de ofrecer transporte, albergues y comida. Pero ya era demasiado tarde. . ..

Focuri de armă la granița moldo-română. Polițiștii de frontieră de peste Prut au depistat aproape 12.000 de pachete cu țigări care urmau să fie transportate din R.Moldova în România. Totul a avut loc în noaptea de întâi aprilie, în zona din apropierea punctului de trecere Rădăuți-Prut. În timp ce patrulau prin zonă, oamenii legii au observat mai multe persoane care încărcau colete voluminoase într-un autoturism de teren. Când și-au dat seama că polițiștii se apropie de ei, contrabandiștii au abandonat coletele și s-au dus de la fața locului. Polițiștii de frontieră s-au luat după ei. Șoferul, evident nu a oprit la somații, de aceea oamenii legii au fost nevoiți să tragă mai multe focuri de armă în pneurile mașinii. Din cauza vitezei, șoferul a acroșat cu vehiculul un copac. Cei aflați în mașină au abandonat vehiculul și au fugit. Despre caz a fost informată și poliția din Republica Moldova, pentru documentarea în comun a cazului. Cele 11.800 de pachete cu țigări au fost confiscate. Polițiștii continuă cercetările.

FRANKFURT/MADRID/COPENHAGEN -- Europe's largest wind turbine makers on Wednesday said they had shut down more factories in Spain, a major hub for the continent's renewables sector, in response to an almost total lockdown in the country to contain the coronavirus outbreak.          Denmark's Vestas, the world No.1, has suspended production at its two Spanish plants, a spokesman told Reuters, adding that its service and maintenance business was still working. Vestas has also paused manufacturing and construction in India, which is under a nationwide lockdown too, he said.          Top rival Siemens Gamesa suspended production at six Spanish factories on Monday, bringing total closures there to eight, a spokeswoman said.          Four components factories are still partially up and running, at Reinosa on the north coast, Cuenca near Madrid, Mungia and Siguiero, she added.          Germany's Nordex, the No.8 globally which is 36% owned by Spain's Acciona, has now shuttered all of its production in Spain, including two nacelle casing factories in Barasoain and Vall d'Uixo, as well as a rotor blade site in Lumbier.          "Production is no longer active," a spokeswoman said in response to a Reuters query.          The new closures take the number of idled wind power factories on the continent to 19, all in Spain and Italy, the European countries worst hit by the pandemic. This figure also includes sites run by General Electric unit LM Wind Power.          Spain is second only to Italy in terms of numbers of coronavirus-related fatalities and restrictions have become even stricter in the country's third week of lockdown.          "Some factories have temporarily paused activity as a precautionary step to strengthen sanitary measures within the sites and guarantee full compliance with government recommendations," industry association WindEurope said.          Consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects new installations in the global wind sector to shrink by 4.9 gigawatts (GW) to 73 GW this year due to the pandemic.          Siemens Gamesa, which is majority-owned by Germany's Siemens , is continuing to build parks, focusing on those sites that are almost ready to be fired up, and operate its park maintenance business.

“(The trip) was cut short seven days in, on March 13, by (cruise company) Holland America Line when Chile refused us port of entry at Punta Arenas. This city is one of the most remote places on the planet, literally the bottom of the world, just above the Antarctic Circle,” Jennifer Broadus said, messaging from sea.          “It became clear we must quickly get to a friendly port for disembarkation and flights home. Chile, which is also in great internal political turmoil, refused us entry anywhere.”          Initially, the conditions were good aboard the ship and the passengers healthy as it journeyed on in search of a hospitable harbor.          Everything changed on March 22 — which was also the couple’s 45th wedding anniversary.          “The captain announced at 2 p.m. that we must immediately return to our rooms as we were being isolated for our own protection because of occurrences of influenza like symptoms by guests and crew,” she said.          “This epidemic began to show growing occurrences particularly with the crew population. There were no test kits to know what we actually had here.”          The couple and the rest of the travelers were confined to their rooms, with food (and even some libations) being deposited at the door by the crew. Passengers were only allowed to leave for a 30-minute walk around the promenade deck.          The ship, while not permitted to dock, was sent supplies. That included coronavirus testing kits. Once testing began, it became clear that there was indeed an outbreak aboard the ship.          At least two cases were known, she said, adding, “since kits are so limited, there’s no doubt there are many more. The bad news is that the (illness) traveled quickly through the crew population and since they are housed in such close density in the bowels of the ship — many, many are sick,” she said.          “We learned a couple of days ago about 40 percent of the crew are affected, or about 230 crew members. Needless to say, the ship’s ability to service guests was greatly limited. We don’t exactly know how many passengers are sick — last count was about 40, maybe more.”          On Friday, the cruise line sent a sister ship to remove the healthy passengers, an estimated 780 people, from the Zaandam. The Broaduses, neither of whom have symptoms, were shifted over to a new vessel, the Rotterdam.          “This leaves approximately 465 guests still on the Zaandam. It is important to note that not all of these guests are sick...many older and mobility challenged guests could not make the difficult transition by tender boat in rough seas,” she said.          “We had to carry our own bags down a very steep metal stairs beside the ship onto a bobbing dock and then step on to a tender boat at rough seas. It was hard even for us.”
