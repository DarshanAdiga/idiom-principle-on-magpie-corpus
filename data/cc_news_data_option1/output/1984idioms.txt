Who says warm weather has to mean beaches? The only thing better than soaking up the sun while strolling by the historic pastel houses of Charleston’s Rainbow Row is doing so en route to happy hour at one of the city’s fantastic cocktail bars, like Proof or The Gin Joint. A trip to Charleston is less about working on your tan and more about slowing down and relaxing. Get lost in the back alleys of Harleston Village, wander Waterfront Park, or browse the many charming downtown boutiques. And if you spend most of your time dreaming about where you’ll enjoy your next meal—Husk or Xiao Bao Biscuit?—well, then you’re doing it right. Plan this one for March because the weather won’t be _quite_ warm enough until then.

For more than a year, it looked like Lori Loughlin would fight the charges against her in the college admissions bribery scandal. Apparently, she's changed her mind: Per the _Los Angeles Times_ and ABC News, the 55-year-old _Full House_ actress and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, according to a plea agreement filed in a Massachusetts federal court. Per the agreements, Loughlin will serve two months in prison, pay a $150,000 fine, and be required to perform 100 hours of community service. Her 56-year-old husband will see five months behind bars, a $250,000 fine, and 250 hours of community service. The terms must be accepted by US District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton.

The Yoga C740 15 is the kind of laptop Lenovo should have knocked out of the park. Its higher-end cousin, the Yoga C940 15, already stands out as a fine MacBook Pro alternative, so the C740 15 could have been a step-down variant. Lenovo did just that with its 14-inch Yoga C740, the cheaper counterpart to the C940 14 convertible. (Both of those laptops are excellent.)
 Sadly, the Lenovo Yoga C740 15 missteps. It has no discrete graphics card like the C940 15, and it uses a much weaker processor, yet it’s not much lighter (0.22 pounds). Its body also seems flimsier, which detracts from the typing experience, and it lacks some of the clever design flourishes from Lenovo’s fanciest convertibles, such as a built-in stylus.
 The Yoga C740 15 does have a few saving graces: Its battery life and screen brightness are excellent for a 15-inch laptop, and it’s less expensive than a lot of similar rivals. But for a laptop that still costs over a grand, the Yoga C740 15’s trade-offs detract from its appeal.

  The famous couple was scheduled to go to trial in October on charges that they paid $500,000 in bribes to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew team recruits, even though neither of them played the sport. They helped create fake athletic profiles for their daughters by sending the admitted ringleader of the scheme, admissions consultant Rick Singer, photos of the teens posing on rowing machines, authorities said.

On Wednesday, May 13, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the extension of Gov. Evers’ Safer at Home order from April 24 to May 26 is invalid.


  Two days later on Friday, May 15, Sawyer County Public Officer Julia Lyons responded with an order for the county not nearly as restrictive as Safer at Home.


  In fact, Lyons’ order only “strongly recommends” that Wisconsin Economic Development Corporations’ (WEDC) guidelines be followed regarding good hygiene, social distancing, disinfection, wearing a face covering (such as a mask), staying home if sick, sheltering if place if considered “medically vulnerable” and working and studying from home when possible.


  For now this is a recommendation, but Lyons said she reserves the authority for more drastic orders if required to stop the spread of the pandemic.


  Right after the Supreme Court ruling, there were five counties that passed orders continuing the Safer at Home restrictions, but some later rescinded orders under pressure or questions of legal authority.


  Scott Manley, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) executive vice president of government relations, said in a webinar on Thursday, April 14, the court decision related to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) overstepping its administrative rule-making authority, and Manly questioned the legality of counties issuing their own Safer at Home orders.


  Then on Friday, May 15, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul issued an opinion that the court’s order addressed DHS’s authority under state statute 252.02 and not the local health officers’ authority under 252.03.


  Kaul said the court found the Safer at Home order lacked enforcement because there were no defined crimes under the state statute it addressed, and the DHS had exercised powers beyond its scope regarding “directing people to stay at home, forbidding certain travel and closing certain businesses.”


  Concerning the authority of local public health officers, Kaul wrote that under 252.03 the local public health officer has “powers to ‘prevent, suppress and control communicable diseases’ and ‘forbids public gatherings when deemed necessary to control outbreaks or epidemics.’”


  He added, “Nothing in the supreme court’s decision even arguably limits other measures directed by a local authority...”


  Lyons has teleconferenced with the county’s legal counsel and is confident of the authority vested in her position. She isn’t considering reconstituting Safer at Home, but more targeted orders could be issued if warranted.


  “When I do have an order, I want a really good reason behind it so I have buy-in from the public,” she said. “At this time, I would like to re-open with the strongly recommended guidance and see how we do. We will continue to monitor, and should we have an uptick, we are going to have to look if we are truly following those best practices, are they working for us and what else do we have to put in place.”


  More positives anticipated


  Working in the county’s and region’s favor is a low number of positive COVID-19 cases. As of Tuesday, May 19, there were only four positives in Sawyer County with three recovered and 552 testing negative.


  However, Lyons has been very vocal that the Safer at Home restriction had a large impact on those low numbers, especially because it restricted mixing in bars and restaurants by those visiting from outside the county from areas with higher numbers of COVID-19 cases — communities where the novel coronavirus was in “community spread.”


  With the invalidation of Safer at Home and bars and restaurants allowed to have seated diners again, Lyons predicts the number of COVID-19 positives in the county will probably rise.


  “I have not been silent about that, and people have to be OK with that,” she said. “That was part of wanting to re-open. People wanted to re-open, so we do anticipate seeing cases, but the thing is can we identify those cases fast enough to be able to isolate them and their close contacts so it doesn’t spread everywhere. And if we can do that, we can maintain control … Safer at Home was put in place to get us to the point where we can test, isolate and do contact tracing (following where individuals who have tested positive might have infected others) and keep it at a rate where the health care system can manage. It wasn’t just to stop the cases, but control the rise and give us time to get prepared.”


  Lyons was asked if a rise of 15-20 positive test results in the county would elevate the level of concern.


  “That would raise a lot of concern, and I would have to look at where those cases are happening,” she said. “Are they all over the place, or are they related to a certain area? Can I connect them to a big gathering? Well, then do we have to look at gatherings? I want to be specific in orders that I write so they are making sense to people.”


  To help Lyons with contact tracing, her staff has been expanded to include a retired nurse, and part-time employees have been made full time.


  “We are going to bring more people onboard,” she said, “and if we get overwhelmed we can bring in the state, but I would love to keep it local.”


  Lyons prefers using local contact tracers who understand the life, work and culture of the area.


  Over 2 percent of county residents having been tested for COVID 19, plus another 382, mostly county residents, who were tested last Thursday in the Village of Winter and Friday in the City of Hayward. That data provides a “baseline” to watch how the disease trends in the county.


  With Memorial Day approaching and the opening of the summer tourist season and thousands of visitors anticipated, a new level of concerns are being raised and test data obtained before the season might reveal the impact of that tourism.


  “We are going to use that (test data) as our guidance and keep monitoring as things go forward,” she said. “I‘m

 Outside of that tiny box, though, there’s a strong case to consider alternatives. Lenovo’s 14-inch Yoga C940 14 has a smaller screen, and the list price is $200 higher, but it weighs only 3 pounds and has longer battery life, far superior graphics performance, better audio quality, a more satisfying keyboard, and a built-in stylus.

“The proposal to provide much-needed housing for homeless veterans and their families is currently under review,” Haviland said. “We are continuing to work with the fairgrounds and Solana Beach to explore other opportunities for housing at the fairgrounds.”
 Solana Beach Mayor Jewel Edson said late Wednesday the idea has merit, but it’s unlikely to help Solana Beach meet its state housing requirements.
 “While I embrace the intent, substantially more project design and community- wide discussions will be necessary to get me fully on board,” Edson said. “A well-run program that creates dignified housing options for veterans, including wrap-around services to help permanantly lift them out of homelessness, is certainly something that I can get behind.
 “However, it is unclear whether the proposed modular units would comply with the HCD-required federal housing unit definition necessary to be counted toward our respective city’s (state low-income housing) allocations,” she said. “Also, neither of the potential fairgrounds locations, horsepark or the RV lot, fall within the Del Mar or Solana Beach city boundaries.

Others parents who've been sent to prison for participating in the scam include “Desperate Housewives” actress Felicity Huffman. She served nearly two weeks behind bars late last year after she admitted to paying $15,000 to have someone correct her daughter’s entrance exam answers.


  The coronavirus pandemic has delayed the prison sentences of some parents and allowed others to go home early.


  California winemaker Agustin Huneeus Jr., who also pleaded guilty, was released from his five-month prison term two weeks early in March because of the public health crisis.

“By 15 May 20, Rs432 billion of principal repayments of loans have been deferred as part of the principal deferment scheme introduced by the SBP in collaboration with the PBA (Pakistan Banks’ Association),” the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a tweet. “Around 600,000 borrowers have benefitted from this scheme. Majority of the beneficiaries in the loan deferment/restructuring are microfinance borrowers who benefitted to the tune of Rs37 billion.” The SBP added that currently banks are processing more than 100,000 requests for deferment and restructuring/rescheduling. The central bank and PBA, in March, announced loan relief to the borrowers suffering disruptions as the lockdown brought the economy and the businesses to a halt.


  Lockdown started to ease ahead of Eid holidays that follow a shopping spree expected to somehow lessen the colossal losses incurred by trade and industry because of two months of freeze on economic activities.


  Meanwhile, SBP said banks sanctioned more than Rs60 billion in loans to help companies pay salaries of their employees under a refinancing scheme announced to avert layoffs.


  State Bank said as of May 15, 1,700 businesses applied to commercial banks to benefit from rozgar (employment) refinance scheme for a total loan amount of Rs120 billion and covering more than 1.1 million employees.


  “Of the total applications received by commercial banks under the scheme, about Rs61 billion representing 600,000 jobs has already been approved and the rest are in process,” the SBP said in another tweet.


  In April, the SBP introduced a temporary refinance scheme for businesses to support the employment of workers in the face of economic challenges posed by lockdown. Its core objective is to incentivise businesses to not lay off their workers. The rozgar finance scheme is available to all businesses in Pakistan through banks and covers all types of employees, including permanent, contractual, daily wages as well as outsourced workers.


  Businesses that benefit from the employment protection scheme commit to not lay off workers for three months.


  State Bank finances up to 100 percent of wages and salaries of businesses with average 3-month wage bills of up to Rs500 million. This can be used for the onward payment of wages and salaries for the months of April, May and June. Previously, 100 percent financing was available up to a wage bill of Rs200 million when the scheme was introduced. The SBP further finances up to 75 percent with maximum financing of Rs1 billion for businesses with 3-month wage bill exceeding Rs500 million. Earlier, 75 percent financing was available up to a maximum of Rs375 million and 50 percent up to a maximum of Rs500 million.

AIIC is a prioritised Special Economic Zone of Faisalabad Industrial Estate Development and Management Company (FIEDMC) working under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).


  “These trade and investment officers working in more than 50 countries will be bound to link the expected investors with one window operation of FIEDMC and update the administration of these economic zones about the trade possibilities of their designated countries for promoting and marketing of Pakistani products which would help the country enhancing volume of exports,” said the adviser while talking to Mian Kashif Ashfaq, chairman FIEDMC in a meeting. “Besides this, the ministry has already tasked its trade and investment officers posted abroad to explore new and viable markets for our new products and to ensure that export orders of Pakistani exporters were not canceled.” Dawood said the government was committed to bring out comprehensive solutions for sustaining the economic growth in the wake of global COVID-19 outbreak. “The government is also committed to shifting the country from being a consumption-driven economy to an investment-driven one”.


  FIEDMC chief Mian Kashif Ashfaq, highlighting the distinctive features of Allama Iqbal Industrial City to adviser, said this sole project would house as many as 400 industries besides giving employments to 250,000 people. He said approximately Rs450 billion foreign and local investments would be pumped into this project and development project is being carried out on fast track. Ashfaq further said FIDEMC had always provided state of the art facilities to its customers besides resolving their issues through one window operation on top priority basis, while the confidence of the investors was being restored after completion of M3 project.

 “This is supposed to be transitory housing that would lead to permanent low- income housing,” said Lisa Barkett, vice president of the 22nd District Agricultural Association board of directors, which oversees activities at the Del Mar Fairgrounds and the horsepark.

Spanning 14 songs over the course of 42 minutes, the album touched all the right notes, featuring a blend of punk-rock and rap.

SSDO said that as per budget rules, pre-budget sessions are mandatory before presenting the budget but due to corona pandemic, the National and Provincial assemblies are not able to hold debate on the upcoming annual budget.


  “It is imperative for all the elected members and local stakeholders to take part in the budget process. Federal and provincial governments should devise a mechanism to take the feedback of members of provincial and national assembly through emails and other virtual options,” says the statement.


  Budget is a planning document both for the government and the businesses in a country. People adjust their expectations about the business environment and public sector programs and decide where they should park their investments in anticipation of a better return on investments. In a nutshell, a budget is a key government document that has an impact on jobs, businesses, and other aspects of economic and social life. In this way, the budget has multiple stakeholders both from the supply and demand side of the financial equation.


  “The SSDO demands that while budgets are in the making, the federal and provincial government budgets must come under debate in the National and Provincial Assemblies,” says the statement while adding that the organization demands that budget policy should not be treated as a secret during the preparation phase. Rather its broader contours such as investment decisions in the social development sector, pro-poor expenditures, and fiscal policy measures such as taxation must be debated in the federal and provincial assemblies as well as in the Senate of Pakistan.


  “SSDO believes that open governments and open budgets help fight against corruption bringing in transparency and accountability mechanisms along with the participatory and inclusive approach to budget-making”.


  The statement says that the importance of an open the debate has actually increased COVID-19 demands change in the allocation of resources for social development such as public health, pro-poor expenditures such as social protection, and also public sector investments in the job creating sectors.


  “It also needs a serious debate about domestic and foreign resource mobilization to meet the emerging challenges during the COVID-19.

London [UK], May 21 (ANI): England women's cricket team likely to start training within weeks, aiming of playing their international series against India and South Africa behind closed doors this season.   Clare Connor, the ECB's managing director of women's cricket, said a planned return of elite women's players was "hopefully just a few weeks away" following the same guidelines as the England men's squad, which has a group of 18 bowlers returning to individualised training programmes at venues around the country on Thursday and Friday with the batsmen returning to nets on June 1, ESPNcricinfo reported.   "The men are back to action in that individualised training environment this week. They are obviously likely to play international cricket before England women this summer and that's why they're up and running first. We're aiming for in a few weeks' time, then we're hopeful of being able to deliver those same sort of protocols in terms of England women's return," Connor said.   "We are making progress all the time in terms of the whole schedule around England men and women and the whole behind-closed-doors project is going really well working with government and other sports. We're still hopeful of being able to deliver both England women's series against India and South Africa later on in the summer," she added.   India's tour to England in June has already been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic but two T20Is and four ODIs against South Africa remain on the calendar for September, as planned.   On Wednesday, the ECB has confirmed that 18 bowlers will resume training this week as the country plans for a return of international cricket.   England became the first cricket playing nation to commence training for its players after been badly hit by the Covid-19. (ANI)

Remote internships, of course, aren't possible in every sector — think of retail or construction. The experts I spoke with say online internships work best when they're project-based, allowing interns to complete assignments on their own time. Mentors should be assigned to work closely with each intern to make sure they don't get lost in the shuffle.
 Arora is trying to build community among his fellow interns. He helped start up a series of group chats that now has hundreds of incoming Apple interns on it. "We're hosting things like Zoom socials just to meet with each other. Asking some questions of previous interns," he says. "So it's a fun time, meeting other people."
 Still, he says he's sad he's missing out on the networking and camaraderie of working at Apple's headquarters. "If the internship was in person, it would have been much better because, you know, you get to make these connections," he says. "You get to meet new people. You have people walking by who are seeing how you're working. And so it's a totally different experience."

The global health crisis has put matches on hold in England until July 1 at the earliest while in other countries the season is already over. Despite the pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is still planning to stage a full home international programme, starting with a three-Test series against the West Indies, which was originally scheduled for June.


  The ECB has announced that up to 18 bowlers will be involved from Thursday.


  Edgbaston, Hove, Old Trafford, the Oval, the Riverside, Taunton and Trent Bridge will stage at least one session, before batsmen and wicketkeepers become involved from June 1.


  The bowlers’ identities have yet to be made public but the choice of venues indicates that James Anderson (Old Trafford) and Stuart Broad (Trent Bridge) will be among the leading England bowlers training at their home county grounds.


  Bowlers will have to bring their own kit, including designated cricket balls, wash their hands regularly, and clean any equipment used with disinfectant wipes.


  England’s schedule also includes three Tests against Pakistan and limited- overs matches against Australia and Ireland, with the fixtures set to be played behind closed doors.


  ECB Chief Executive Tom Harrison has warned a season without any matches at all could cost the board Â£380 million ($465 million).
