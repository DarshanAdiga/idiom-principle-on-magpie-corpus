Thus, we can infer that Ethiopia‚Äôs constitution was a result of political bargaining. Even if some facts might be overlooked by the constitutional commission and assembly, it might also have used silences as a political- management tool. Therefore, the way out of the current constitutional crisis we face as a nation should be seen in light of the origin of the constitution itself. As long as the constitution doesn‚Äôt clearly outsource the task of filling its silences, they should be filled through political negotiation and accommodation. Beyond this reasoning, the debate between competing parties may also enrich their relationship and help us to reconcile our distinct and shared Ethiopian values.

If the first anniversary of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's first term in the office was marked by global outreach and the promise of becoming one of the world's fastest-growing economies; the first year of the second term has seen the government tick nearly all of the boxes for key poll promises, some dating back to decades.
 On Sunday, the NDA government completes a year in office amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The government's report card has a long list of accomplishments even as it is struggles to revive the economy, save jobs and lives due to the viral outbreak.
 There was shock and awe when within two months after coming back to power, as the government accomplished what was perceived to be unattainable --- the scrapping of Article 370 from Jammu & Kashmir that stripped the border state of its special status. The BJP-led government had a string of successes within the first six months of its rule such as getting Parliament's nod for banning triple talaq; allowing citizenship to persecuted minorities from south Asian countries; and receiving a favourable Supreme Court verdict on the Ramjanmabhoomi case, paving the way for the construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya.
 However, the achievements were marred by violent clashes that broke out over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the proposed National Register for Citizens (NRC), and the Delhi riots that left at least 53 people dead earlier this year, apart from the economic disruptions.
 But the government is all set to reach out to the masses with a long list of its accomplishments, where its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed over 4,000 lives to date, tops the list.
 The BJP will reach out to the public with letters from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, focusing on the theme of self-reliance or Atama Nirbharta and the party workers will make use of the virtual world to publicise the success story scripted by the government in its first year of rule in the second successive term.
 "The BJP has kept its promises. Most of the poll promises were fulfilled within six months of assuming office. Even during the pandemic the government has ensured that there is a fair distribution of resources and prevented unrest, which is a huge achievement," said Bhupinder Yadav, general secretary, BJP.
 The pandemic has given the government a chance to prove its mettle, Yadav said, despite casting a pall of gloom over the first anniversary celebrations.
 "PM Modi's initiatives, whether it was the timing of the lockdown or the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package, have been appreciated globally. India has played a lead role in galvanising countries to fight the pandemic in a united manner," Yadav said.
 While the opposition parties critical of the government's response to the pandemic cite the hardships faced by the poor and the migrant workers as a major failure and question the timing of anniversary celebrations, Yadav said it is the responsibility of the government to present its report card.
 Is the government's response to the economic upheaval a measure of its performance, as the pandemic appeared to have halted the country's bid to achieve the $5 trillion economy goal by 2024-25?
 Prof Biswajit Dhar of the Jawaharal Nehru University (JNU) said there is enough room for the government to do more and it is not the time to take credit.
 "The government has to redouble its efforts. Pre-Covid-19 also the economy was going downhill, as we had registered one of the weakest growth for several quarters for a long time. One thing, which is common between then and now, is that there is a greater role for government involvement and role for fiscal policy to help us weather the storm and we haven't seen that happen. Even now the government is not willing to use the fiscal space adequately, even the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has spoken about it," he said.
 Dhar suggested the government a roadmap, as the markets have collapsed completely.
 "‚Ä¶You cannot expect the private sector to borrow money or come up with investment; that was not happening even before Covid-19 struck, despite the tax benefits to the corporates. We didn't see adequate investments coming in because there was a demand deficiency. We expect the government to be more pro-active," he said.
 Political analyst Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Studies of Developing Societies (CSDS) said the government may want to create a buzz around the demand for building of the Ram temple and scrapping of Article 370 being met, but it also has to address the concerns that the lockdown was ill-planned and the migrant workers have been left to fend for themselves. "We have to see how they carry out damage control on that front," he said.

Italy's Serie A has been given the all-clear to return on June 20 after a three-month enforced absence in one of the epicentres of the coronavirus pandemic.
 For the Scudetto, all remains to be played for with leaders Juventus just one point ahead of Lazio, in what had been shaping up to be one of the most exciting title chases in years.
 There are also other issues to sort out, including relegation and next year's European places, with all the drama set to take place behind closed doors in empty stadiums.
 AFP Sport takes a look at what still needs to be resolved.
 Juve dominance in peril
 Juventus's dominance of Serie A has seen them win the last eight titles in succession but is now in peril in coach Maurizio Sarri's first season in charge, with the Turin giants holding a slim one-point advantage over challengers Lazio.
 Lazio had been one of the most vocal teams pushing for a return to action as they have the best chance in years to lift a third Scudetto in the club's 120-year history.
 Simone Inzaghi's side are unbeaten in the league since September 25, when they lost 1-0 to Inter Milan at San Siro.
 They beat Juventus twice in December by a 3-1 scoreline, including in the Italian Super Cup, and are due to visit the Allianz Stadium in Week 34 of the season.
 The top two have 12 games left to play with Inter, nine points behind the leaders in third, and Atalanta 15 points adrift, having both played one game fewer.
 Juventus also have the Italian Cup still to play, while Lazio's focus will solely be on the league title which they last won in 2000.
 Champions League fight
 Juventus and Lazio's places at the top table of European football next season look assured with Inter also well positioned to qualify for the Champions League in third.
 The battle looks set to be for the fourth spot with Atalanta, who are through to the quarter-finals of this year's Champions League in their first ever appearance in the competition, three points ahead of Roma, who are fifth.
 Napoli are six points behind the side from the capital in the second Europa League berth.
 Zlatan Ibrahimovic's AC Milan are just outside the Europa League places, three points behind Napoli, with Verona and Parma a further point adrift.
 Ronaldo v Immobile duel
 Lazio forward Ciro Immobile was having a stunning season prior to the shutdown and leads the Serie A scorers chart with 27 goals scored in 26 games, six ahead of Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo.
 Inter's Romelu Lukaku has scored 17 league goals in his first season in Italy since arriving from Manchester United and is third overall.
 Relegation battle
 Brescia, SPAL and Lecce occupy the three relegation places, at the bottom of the table.
 Brescia are 20th and last with 16 points from 26 games and look destined to return to Serie B as they sit nine points from safety. SPAL are only two points better off in 19th.
 However, the fight is on to avoid the third relegation place with Lecce currently occupying that position but equal on points with 17th-placed Genoa.
 Udinese, Torino and Sampdoria are also hovering just above the relegation zone.

The COVID-19 coronavirus may have tapped the brakes on car sales and production, but dealers and manufacturers are already in a higher gear in anticipation of a fast and furious recovery.
   
 "We are optimistic about selling and servicing more vehicles than we did last year," said Amit Patel, general manager of Spartanburg Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram.
   
 Patel said a brand new facility at 8200 Fairforest Road combined with rock- bottom financing rates on new and used vehicles are huge reasons for the bright outlook.
   
 Like most industries, car and tire makers slowed or shut down production in mid-March, laying off employees for several weeks and deep-cleaning facilities. As a result, many parts suppliers in the Upstate and South Carolina have also slowed down.
   
 MORE REBUILDING AMERICA STORIES
   
 BMW Manufacturing in Spartanburg County shut down from March 28 to May 3, and since, has begun ramping up production one shift at a time, while carefully following Centers for Disease Control guidelines to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19, according to BMW spokeswoman Sky Foster.
   
 Face masks are required of workers who are unable to maintain a 6-foot social distance; employees self-check their body temperatures; seating has been spaced apart in the cafeteria and offices; and lunch schedules have been staggered.
   
 Michelin North America has about 22,650 employees and operates 20 major plants. Locally, Michelin makes tires and tread rubber at facilities in Duncan, Spartanburg and Greenville. It also operates a distribution center in southwestern Spartanburg County.
   
 Some of Michelin's plants were idled and others cut back production. Tire production dropped as car makers suspended production and consumers went into isolation.
   
 "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, Michelin has remained focused on the long-term health, safety and well-being of our employees," said Michelin North America spokesman Phil Watson.
   
 Following CDC guidelines, Michelin is also ramping up production again with adjusted work schedules, employee health screenings, requiring employees to wear masks, and frequent cleaning of common areas like break rooms and restrooms.
   
 Meanwhile, a few car dealerships in Greer and Greenville closed temporarily due to the coronavirus, while others cut back operations while coming up with new ways to sell cars.
   
 "The biggest change we have seen with the buying habits of our customers is they are doing more research from home," Patel said. "More consumers are setting up their deal via the Internet. My Internet sales team has been busier than ever."
   
 Online shopping has also been popular with customers of Vic Bailey Ford Lincoln in Spartanburg.
   
 "We already offer vehicle delivery, but now with the pandemic, we offer at- home test drives as well," said marketing director Leslie Bailey Calicutt. "Customers can shop and buy a vehicle without stepping foot in our dealership."
   
 The pandemic and related closures have also prompted car markers to get creative with financing.
   
 Ford has a "Built to Lend a Hand" program, with Ford paying the first three months of the vehicle, then the next three payments can be deferred. That's six months of relief.
   
 Ford is also offering 0 percent financing on most models with terms as long as 84 months. Lincoln is also offering financing and deferred payments up to four months.
   
 Patel said the coronavirus has paused any new inventory until July.
   
 "However, we have plenty of vehicles in stock to sell," he said. "Luckily, our manufacturer is beefing up incentives. Along with our already low prices, consumers are able to purchase vehicles cheaper and with better finance terms than ever before."
   
 He said 0 percent interest for 72 months and 0.9 percent financing for 84 months is being offered on most new models. There are also deep discounts and rebates along with payment deferrals for up to 120 days.
   
 "Since the Federal Reserve has dropped the prime rate, standard financing rates on new and used vehicles are at a 10-year low," Patel said. "So we are seeing a lot of great deals."
   
 Among other area car dealers offering incentives are Wakefield Automotive, Benson Chrysler Dodge Jeep, Dick Brooks Honda, and Bradshaw Chevrolet Buick GMC of Greer.

The Hungarian capital Budapest on Friday marked the anniversary of one its worst-ever shipping disasters, the sinking of a sightseeing vessel on the Danube which killed at least 27 people, mostly South Korean tourists.
 The Mermaid sightseeing boat carrying a tour group sank seconds after colliding with the bigger Swiss-registered Viking Sigyn river cruise vessel on May 29 2019.
 The body of a 28th victim was never found.
 The Panorama Deck company that operated the Mermaid organised a commemorative event on Friday morning involving three boats sailing down the Danube in formation and a wreath being solemnly lowered into the waters under overcast skies.
 The bell of one of the boats rang 28 times and the same number of candles was lit on board another of the vessels.
 A Panorama Deck spokesman said "the disaster happened because the rules were not kept," referring to regulations governing river traffic on the Danube.
 Later on Friday morning, another ceremony took place on the riverbank with a wreath being laid by Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and South Korean ambassador Kyoo Sik Choe.
 Karacsony promised that city authorities "will do everything to ensure that such accidents can not happen again".
 "A review of rules regulating boat traffic on the river is underway," he said, adding: "We can look for justice in the unjust".
 \- Captain on trial -
 The three men announced that a joint monument -- a memorial stone designed jointly by Hungarian and South Korean artists -- would be erected near the scene.
 Construction of the monument has been delayed by the novel coronavirus pandemic and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
 The disaster, on a busy stretch of the Danube in the heart of Budapest, was Hungary's worst boating accident in more than half a century.
 Some of the victims' bodies were recovered dozens of kilometres (miles) south of the Hungarian capital in the aftermath of the disaster.
 Earlier this year, the trial began of the Ukrainian captain of the larger Viking Sigyn vessel.
 Yurij Caplinskij, 64, is charged with "endangering waterborne traffic resulting in multiple deaths" and 35 counts of failing to provide help.
 During the opening hearing at a district court in Budapest, prosecutors said they were seeking a nine-year jail term for Caplinskij if he admitted all the charges.
 The Ukrainian refused to however, and declined to make any further statement.

With the Covid-19 pandemic expected to hit Goa's tourism- dependent economy harder than initially thought, people across the state have begun to fall back on more traditional occupations such as agriculture and fishing in a bid to tide over the fall in their incomes.The State Agriculture Department has reported more than four-fold increase in demand for seeds, mainly for planting vegetables."Usually we used to sell between 200-250 kilos of seed during this time of the year. But this year we have already sold 800 kilos of seed," Nevil Alphonso Director of Agriculture said. "This is one of the clearest indicators that people are going back to agriculture in these times," he added. "The biggest demand has been for vegetable seed which can be grown multiple times. We are also seeing an increase in the demand for paddy but we will have to wait until the end of June to measure the increase in area under paddy cultivation -- Goa's staple crop-- increases," he added. Vegetables offer the farmers a better price and, unlike rice, can be sold locally even in small quantities. There is demand mainly for vegetables like gourds, pumpkins and cucumbers which grow well during this season as well as beans and ladyfingers. "At the end of the day, we have to do something to fill our stomachs. Some will go back to fishing, some will go back to farming," said Damiao Telles who used to once run a stall along the Candolim beach serving tourists.Tourism being Goa's biggest revenue-earner, a lot of people have left their traditional occupations like farming and fishing and joined the tourism industry, becoming taxi operators, small hotel owners, shack owners, watersports operators and guesthouse owners. But with tourism now at a standstill due to coronavirus pandemic, these people are relying on their savings or going back to these traditional occupations to earn a living. "We have been guiding and encouraging people to plant within their own backyards and kitchens or in whatever area they can find and teaching them techniques on what crops can be grown alongside others to help with the soil fixation," Miguel Braganza a professor of agriculture said. The arrival of the monsoons marks the sowing season in Goa much as in the rest of the country.The Goa government has set up a task force to recommend an economic revival plan for each village that is being anchored by the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development and the Directorate of Higher Education. In an initial document the committee has suggested all panchayats identify potential activities within the village which can provide livelihood to the people -- agriculture and allied activities, horticulture, poultry, dairy, fishing and reviving micro and small scale industries besides traditional livelihood options like artisans etc and a plan to process and market the products. However, challenges remain. Some have complained about lack of cooperation from local panchayat authorities and support from the government to help cultivate lands some of which have been fallow for a few decades. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said that he expects the slowdown in tourism to be temporary."Tourism may have dropped for now, but when tourism starts, Goa Tourism is in a better position to quickly rebound in comparison with the rest of the country and will scale new heights.

The economy isn't going to bounce back quickly on its own from the coronavirus pandemic. State reopenings, premature or not, will restore a modicum of economic activity, but it won't be enough to put many local businesses in the black. If the virus comes roaring back in states that reopen, it will cause a wave of fear that will depress demand and send some places back into lockdown. Meanwhile, wary consumers are saving their money, which will depress demand. And global trade networks and supply chains will remain in shambles for some time as the pandemic reverberates around the world. Meanwhile, although the pace of unemployment claims has slowed slightly, millions of Americans continue to lose their jobs.

If the first anniversary of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's first term in the office was marked by global outreach and the promise of becoming one of the world's fastest-growing economies; the first year of the second term has seen the government tick nearly all of the boxes for key poll promises, some dating back to decades.On Sunday, the NDA government completes a year in office amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The government's report card has a long list of accomplishments even as it is struggles to revive the economy, save jobs and lives due to the viral outbreak.There was shock and awe when within two months after coming back to power, as the government accomplished what was perceived to be unattainable --- the scrapping of Article 370 from Jammu & Kashmir that stripped the border state of its special status. The BJP-led government had a string of successes within the first six months of its rule such as getting Parliament's nod for banning triple talaq; allowing citizenship to persecuted minorities from south Asian countries; and receiving a favourable Supreme Court verdict on the Ramjanmabhoomi case, paving the way for the construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya. However, the achievements were marred by violent clashes that broke out over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the proposed National Register for Citizens (NRC), and the Delhi riots that left at least 53 people dead earlier this year, apart from the economic disruptions.But the government is all set to reach out to the masses with a long list of its accomplishments, where its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed over 4,000 lives to date, tops the list.The BJP will reach out to the public with letters from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, focusing on the theme of self-reliance or Atama Nirbharta and the party workers will make use of the virtual world to publicise the success story scripted by the government in its first year of rule in the second successive term. "The BJP has kept its promises. Most of the poll promises were fulfilled within six months of assuming office. Even during the pandemic the government has ensured that there is a fair distribution of resources and prevented unrest, which is a huge achievement," said Bhupinder Yadav, general secretary, BJP.The pandemic has given the government a chance to prove its mettle, Yadav said, despite casting a pall of gloom over the first anniversary celebrations."PM Modi's initiatives, whether it was the timing of the lockdown or the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package, have been appreciated globally. India has played a lead role in galvanising countries to fight the pandemic in a united manner," Yadav said.While the opposition parties critical of the government's response to the pandemic cite the hardships faced by the poor and the migrant workers as a major failure and question the timing of anniversary celebrations, Yadav said it is the responsibility of the government to present its report card.Is the government's response to the economic upheaval a measure of its performance, as the pandemic appeared to have halted the country's bid to achieve the $5 trillion economy goal by 2024-25?Prof Biswajit Dhar of the Jawaharal Nehru University (JNU) said there is enough room for the government to do more and it is not the time to take credit."The government has to redouble its efforts. Pre-Covid-19 also the economy was going downhill, as we had registered one of the weakest growth for several quarters for a long time. One thing, which is common between then and now, is that there is a greater role for government involvement and role for fiscal policy to help us weather the storm and we haven't seen that happen. Even now the government is not willing to use the fiscal space adequately, even the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has spoken about it," he said.Dhar suggested the government a roadmap, as the markets have collapsed completely. "‚Ä¶You cannot expect the private sector to borrow money or come up with investment; that was not happening even before Covid-19 struck, despite the tax benefits to the corporates. We didn't see adequate investments coming in because there was a demand deficiency. We expect the government to be more pro-active," he said.Political analyst Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Studies of Developing Societies (CSDS) said the government may want to create a buzz around the demand for building of the Ram temple and scrapping of Article 370 being met, but it also has to address the concerns that the lockdown was ill-planned and the migrant workers have been left to fend for themselves. "We have to see how they carry out damage control on that front," he said.

Of the Big Ten West divisional opponent breakdowns, we saved Iowa for last. It is the new rivalry game on Nebraska‚Äôs schedule ‚Äî this year it's on Nov. 14 instead of Black Friday ‚Äî and the Hawkeyes‚Äô five-game winning streak has certainly added good-natured fuel to the fire.
 Aside from a month in 2015 ‚Äî and a stunning rout of Ohio State in 2017 ‚Äî Iowa has not exactly been a national program. But it has been a regional power, a ship with a steady course that keeps stealing some of the wind NU needs. A Husker win over the Hawkeyes would now be viewed as a sign of progress.
 That‚Äôs where Iowa is. What Nebraska used to be just five years ago.
 Iowa wins the games it should win ‚Äî especially in nonconference play ‚Äî loses most of the games it should lose, puts some guys in the NFL and generally hums along without threatening the giants of the sport.
 Iowa has 47 wins in five seasons, the highest five-year total in school history. That‚Äôs also the same number of wins Nebraska had from 2010-14.
 Imagine a house on a plateau, with a long valley stretching out below the backyard. From the front yard, one sees higher peaks yet to climb.
 Iowa surveys the valley. Nebraska contemplates the peaks.
 It‚Äôs why Scott Frost‚Äôs job is harder than Ferentz's, who will retire as the winningest coach in Iowa history. Frost is asked to recreate the feats of statues around Memorial Stadium. Ferentz will one day have his own statue outside Kinnick Stadium.
 But he may not have reached legendary status without the last five seasons. Though apparently nowhere near retirement, Ferentz has retooled his program and positioned it for greater success after he leaves. Iowa once seemed to have peaked under Ferentz from 2002-04, when Iowa was churning out five NFL draft picks per year and ran the league's preferred offense. But Ferentz took the Hawkeyes up a notch over the last five seasons.
 Iowa switched to morning practices and benefited. It completed its football facility in 2015, and Ferentz did some of the heavy lifting fundraising for it. Iowa got far more aggressive in recruiting, hiring a director of recruiting, Tyler Barnes, in 2016 who talks alongside Ferentz at signing day press conferences.
 The Hawkeyes found stability at quarterback with CJ Beathard and Nate Stanley. The tight end play from George Kittle, Noah Fant and TJ Hockenson has been peerless. The line play has been typically good, but where Iowa has struck the most gold ‚Äî to the point of being a recruiting outlier ‚Äî is with defensive backs.

I suppose, by the solicitor general (SG)'s definition, I am a prophet of doom. I was astonished to read some of his words before the Supreme Court. I was saddened (but relieved) that it took our judiciary this long to intervene on behalf of migrant workers. I have spent more than 70 days, clocking 15,000 kilometres, travelling through 12 states, chronicling the despair of the workforce that has built our cities, powered our factories, run our kitchens, looked after our children -- and was effectively orphaned by elite callousness and lack of political imagination. The Honourable SG, Tushar Mehta, might dismiss me as a "vulture". But millions of Indians would have been rendered invisible had a handful of people not doggedly decided to tell their story. We all appreciate that we are not administering a country as humongous and complex as India. We understand that many things are clear with the benefit of hindsight. And that enforcing the world's biggest lockdown comes with many glitches. But to attack those who have spoken up for the poor and documented their exodus, on the ground, often at risk to their own lives, is both peculiar and unfeeling. I remember walking with a migrant worker, a contract labourer in an automobile company, right after the lockdown was first announced. He was seething with rage. "Can they not even arrange buses for us? Is it because we are poor?" He was going to walk hundreds of kilometres to Uttar Pradesh. "Only the poor will die. Not even one child of a politician will die," he erupted. To call the coronavirus a great equaliser turned out to be the greatest falsification of our time. From Mumbai to Delhi, from Telangana to Kerala, India's poor have paid the price to keep our class safe. The lockdown has shielded the wealthy and the upper-middle class. The poorest citizen has been pushed to the periphery. Being in the field for more than two months has numbed me to the noise of party politics. I find my eyes rolling at the Congress fighting with Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath over buses or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) targeting the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. I don't watch the yawn-inducing television debates that focus on these extraneous issues. Because out there, in the slum tenements of our country, or at the back of crowded trucks on which workers pay Rs 3,000 to get a narrow spot, all this is alien. And phrases such as social distancing only sound ironical. At least 92 million Indian households live in one room, sometimes six or eight in a space no larger than a cupboard. Work from home is a concept that means nothing. As entire universes are carried on wheels and the country's largest exodus since Partition unfolds, some of our city-slicker slogans on hygiene and not-crowding are just new kinds of deracinated privilege. In Dharavi, Mumbai, where I spent a considerable number of days reporting, there are 8,000 common toilets for about eight hundred thousand people, which makes containing the virus an enormous challenge. As this pandemic exposes the nation's stratified, unequal society for what it is, some of these inequities are the legacy of decades, of course. And every government is complicit. But the policy roller-coaster on migrant workers is inexplicable. On March 30, Mehta informed the court that there were "no migrants on the road." But the truth (unequivocally captured on camera ) is that for nearly two months after that our workers remained on the road. Until one week ago, I met men, women and children on highway after highway, walking on foot, unwilling or unable to wait any longer for trains and buses. Or chasing trucks, with folded hands, begging for a ride, offering anything the driver wanted in exchange. When the trains were first announced, I was excited to wave off a train from Surat as it took workers to Bihar. But even this was handled with needless lack of transparency and incorrect information. The Centre and states insist workers are not paying for train tickets. But they are. I was on board a train from Karnataka to Uttar Pradesh and every single worker I met had paid for his own ticket, taking loans, selling phones to do so. I interviewed the wife of Qazi Anwar who died on a train going home. They too had bought their own tickets, paying Rs 700 extra to the tout who helped them get these. The SG must know we would all like some good news. But hope cannot be the glossing over of reality or sugar-coating tragedy. I would call doing that an abdication of duty -- both moral and professional. Barkha Dutt is an award-winning journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî U.S. consumer spending plunged by a record- shattering 13.6% in April as the viral pandemic shuttered businesses, forced millions of layoffs and sent the economy into a deep recession.Last month's spending decline was far worse than the revised 6.9% drop in March, which itself had set a record for the steepest one-month fall in records dating to 1959. Friday's Commerce Department figures reinforced evidence that the economy is gripped by the worst downturn in decades, with consumers unable or too anxious to spend much.Even with employers cutting millions of jobs, personal incomes soared 10.5% in April, reflecting billions of dollars in support through government payments in the form of unemployment aid and stimulus checks. Wages and salaries, normally the key component of overall income, sank by an annualized $740 billion in April. By contrast, income in the form of government support jumped by an annualized $3 trillion. That form of income, though, will likely fade in coming months as certain forms of government aid expire.Friday's report showed sharp declines in consumer spending across the board ‚Äî from durable goods like cars to non-durable items such as clothing to services ranging from doctor visits to haircuts. Spending tumbled 17.3% for durable goods, 16.2% for non-durables and 12.2% for services. The depth of the spending drop is particularly damaging because consumer spending is the primary driver of the economy, accounting for about 70% of economic activity. Last month's figure signaled that the April-June quarter will be especially grim, with the economy thought to be shrinking at an annual rate near 40%. That would be, by far, the worst quarterly contraction on record.The report showed that an inflation gauge preferred by the Federal Resere fell by 0.5% after a 0.2% decline in March. The Fed has cited the absence of inflation pressures as one reason they are able to be as aggressive in providing support to the economy by cutting its benchmark interest rate to a record low near zero and pumping billions of dollars into credit markets to keep them from freezing up.In April, the nation's jobless rate was 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression, and many economists think it will top 20% for May. States are gradually restarting their economies by letting some businesses reopen with certain restrictions, and some laid-off employees are being recalled to work. Still, the job market remains severely depressed, and the outlook for the rest of the year is still bleak.Some financial support for the tens of millions of consumers who have been laid off over the past two months is coming from weekly unemployment benefits. Besides whatever unemployment aid states are providing to laid-off workers, the federal government is providing $600 a week in additional benefits.A debate in Congress over whether to extend the $600 a week in federal unemployment aid looks sure to intensify, with the number of people receiving that aid now topping 30 million ‚Äî one in five workers. The money is set to expire July 31. Yet with the unemployment rate widely expected to still be in the mid-teens by then, lawmakers will face pressure to compromise on some form of renewed benefits.The Trump administration asserts that the economy will begin to regain its health in the second half of the year, with businesses increasingly reopening and restoring jobs and consumers increasing spending. Most economists say, though, that the lingering effects of the job losses and likely business bankruptcies will take longer to overcome, especially if a second wave of the coronavirus erupts. Analysts generally believe the economy won't manage to sustain a solid recovery until a vaccine is widely available.And until Americans resume spending at something close to their previous levels, jobs won't likely return in a significant way. Data from Chase Bank credit and debit cards shows that consumers have slowly increased their spending since the government distributed $1,200 stimulus checks in mid- April.But most of that increase has occurred in online shopping. Spending in regular brick and mortar stores, which makes up the vast majority of consumer spending, is still down 35% from a year ago, according to Chase, after having plummeted 50% at its lowest point.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

_Section 230(c) was designed to address early court decisions holding that, if an online platform restricted access to some content posted by others, it would thereby become a ‚Äúpublisher‚Äù of all the content posted on its site for purposes of torts such as defamation.  As the title of section 230(c) makes clear, the provision provides limited liability ‚Äúprotection‚Äù to a provider of an interactive computer service (such as an online platform) that engages in ‚Äú‚ÄòGood Samaritan‚Äô blocking‚Äù of harmful content.  In particular, the Congress sought to provide protections for online platforms that attempted to protect minors from harmful content and intended to ensure that such providers would not be discouraged from taking down harmful material.  The provision was also intended to further the express vision of the Congress that the internet is a ‚Äúforum for a true diversity of political discourse.‚Äù  47 U.S.C. 230(a)(3).

It doesn't take long to understand what type of person Ada Hegerberg is. One of the world's best female footballers certainly likes to be punctual.
 "I'm so, so sorry, I really hate being late!" she says, visibly irked despite being only four minutes behind schedule for the start of this interview. Perhaps unsurprisingly, tardiness isn't in the vocabulary of a striker whose brilliant career has been built on her ability to unerringly be at the right place at the right time on a football pitch.
 Deadly in front of goal -- she has scored over 300 career goals -- the Norwegian gives nothing less than 100% to the sport she loves.
 It's an attitude that's brought her a string of accolades in recent years. She is the first woman to win the Ballon d'Or, the biggest individual prize in world football, and is the all-time leading scorer in the Women's Champions League, a competition she's won a record four successive times with her club Olympique Lyonnais.
 But in January, just before the world was put on hold, Hegerberg was forced to press pause for the first time in her career after sustaining a season-ending ACL injury during a training session.
 After months of rehab amidst a global pandemic, the 26-year-old says she's gained a new perspective.
 "I think it's the perfect time and opportunity to lean back and discover other sides of my game, and to explore other arenas where you can gain perspective and learn a lot and to be better prepared when you get back on the pitch," she explains.
 "My philosophy is that when I get back I really want to be stronger than ever, and for that you need time and you need to know your body, your mind and know when the right time is to get back."
 One way she has been gaining perspective is by watching every sports documentary she can. And there's one in particular that has enthralled her -- The Last Dance, a 10-part docuseries which follows Michael Jordan's final, tumultuous season with the Chicago Bulls.
 "Oh I'm so glad you asked me about The Last Dance! I just finished the last episode and I didn't want it to end," Hegerberg says.
 "It's very interesting to see the coach Phil Jackson's philosophy in terms of managing the team. It's a very, very valuable lesson for me as an athlete as well, to see how he coaches a team. Basically, having the best players in a group and knowing how to get the best out of each and every one of them."
 Despite being one of the most celebrated strikers in the world, and with a reputation for being the most competitive player on her team, Hegerberg is reluctant to draw any comparisons between herself and Jordan -- but for one exception.
 "What really got me was the episode where he talked about how much it takes to win and how much it took from him to be that winning character," she says of the ruthlessly competitive Jordan.
 "When he talks about the fact that it's lonely at the top and got emotional at the end of one episode ... It really got me because I really understood what he meant. I invest everything into football every day in order to perform."
 Hegerberg continues to sacrifice her place on Norway's national team.
 After taking the conscious decision to step away from the women's team in 2017 over the unfair treatment of her team compared to the men, Hegerberg has been buoyed by the US Women's National team, and particularly Megan Rapinoe, over their fight for equal pay.
 Earlier this month a federal judge threw out the unequal pay claims by the players, but allowed their allegations of discriminatory working conditions to go to trial. Attorneys for the players were asking to postpone the trial, which currently is scheduled for June 16.
 "The US team is filled with great characters," says the Norwegian. "Rapinoe has always had the guts to stand up for the sport and we really need figures like that. "She's taken a beating for us all at times, standing up for what she believes in, and we need that.
 "Being a women's footballer today -- it's impossible to not be standing for equality. That's why we need to be together on this in order to make a change for the future."
 However, the future is looking uncertain for women's football.
 In England, the remainder of the Women's Super League (WSL) and Championship seasons have been canceled because of the pandemic. In France, elite sport has been put on hold until September, while the women's European Championship has been pushed back to 2022.
 There are fears the ongoing pandemic could erode the strides women's football made during and following the hugely successful 2019 Women's World Cup.
 Hegerberg says she's particularly concerned about impact of playing behind closed doors. In Germany, the Frauen-Bundesliga will resume on May 29 with all matches played behind closed doors.
 "Our recognition comes from the number of people who attend our games," Hegerberg explains. "That was a really good trend before this crisis. It was one of the main goals, to get people to games, to draw more attention to women's football week in, week out. But being in a situation like this, it stops that good trend. We have to deal with [that] and keep pushing in order not to lose that positive development."
 As Hegerberg readies herself for a return to the sport, whenever that may be, she and her husband are grateful to finally be able to watch live football on TV.
 Hegerbereg's husband is Thomas Rogne, who plays for Polish side Lech Poznan. She was recently able to join him in Poland after isolating in France -- although the return of Germany's Bundesliga meant a special occasion almost passed the pair by.
 "It's our one-year wedding anniversary!" she says.
 "We woke up and a family member told us and we were like, 'What?' We were more thinking about watching a game in the Bundesliga, so we had other things on our mind."

 Spring has come here in Ashoro and the weather has been getting a lot warmer lately. It has been an unusual spring compared to last year when I first arrived in Ashoro, due to the current state of emergency in Hokkaido from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Luckily, we were still able to enjoy seeing the cherry blossoms blooming at the start of May. The spring of holidays dubbed "Golden Week" during the first week of May is the peak time for people in Japan to travel throughout the country and find some nice weather for the five day-long break. This year it was more of a "stay-cation" for people and everyone mostly stuck close to home. We were at least able to walk around in the parks near Ashoro to take some pictures of the cherry blossom trees and escape from the house for a few minutes each day. I'm hoping things continue to get better in Japan so I can enjoy some golfing with my friends and coworkers this summer!
 Since the beginning of May, there have been some social distancing efforts made by businesses. In our offices at the Board of Education, we are only allowed to have half of the staff in each day with the other half doing telework from home. Restaurants are also continuing to provide take-out and delivery service but only allowed to remain open until 7 pm. Other public buildings such as the gym, public pool, and library have remained closed.
 Although we are still under a state of emergency in Hokkaido, students have been able to return to school at a reduced capacity. The students began to return to class on May 18. Their classes are being split into two groups, alternating days on which they attend school. Wearing a mask is mandatory for everyone who enters the school and a staggered seating plan has also been implemented to reduce contact and keep physical distance between the students. Even the school sports teams and club activities have been cancelled for the foreseeable future until it is safe for everyone to participate.
 I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy back in Canada!

La Liga president Javier Tebas said on Friday that the league is hoping the 2020/21 season can start on September 12.
 The current campaign is still suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, although La Liga is targeting a return on June 11 with the Seville derby between Real Betis and Sevilla.
 There are still 11 rounds of matches in the Spanish top flight to be played this term.
 "The important thing will be to know the end date of the 2019-20 season," Tebas told Marca. "The next one will start on September 12.
 "God willing, we will restart on June 11. We are waiting for Madrid and Barcelona to move onto phase two (of easing of lockdown rules)."
 The Spanish government last week gave La Liga the green light to resume from June 8.
 Tebas also said that television viewers would be able to choose whether to watch matches, which will all be played behind closed doors, with virtual sound effects added.
 The German Bundesliga has already played three matchdays following its restart earlier this month, while the English Premier League and Italy's Serie A are also set to return in mid-June.
 But the top-flight seasons in France, Belgium and the Netherlands have all been ended.
 Barcelona led Real Madrid by two points at the top of the table when La Liga was halted in March.

With the Covid-19 pandemic expected to hit Goa's tourism-dependent economy harder than initially thought, people across the state have begun to fall back on more traditional occupations such as agriculture and fishing in a bid to tide over the fall in their incomes.
 The State Agriculture Department has reported more than four-fold increase in demand for seeds, mainly for planting vegetables.
 "Usually we used to sell between 200-250 kilos of seed during this time of the year. But this year we have already sold 800 kilos of seed," Nevil Alphonso Director of Agriculture said. "This is one of the clearest indicators that people are going back to agriculture in these times," he added.
 "The biggest demand has been for vegetable seed which can be grown multiple times. We are also seeing an increase in the demand for paddy but we will have to wait until the end of June to measure the increase in area under paddy cultivation -- Goa's staple crop-- increases," he added.
 Vegetables offer the farmers a better price and, unlike rice, can be sold locally even in small quantities. There is demand mainly for vegetables like gourds, pumpkins and cucumbers which grow well during this season as well as beans and ladyfingers.
 "At the end of the day, we have to do something to fill our stomachs. Some will go back to fishing, some will go back to farming," said Damiao Telles who used to once run a stall along the Candolim beach serving tourists.
 Tourism being Goa's biggest revenue-earner, a lot of people have left their traditional occupations like farming and fishing and joined the tourism industry, becoming taxi operators, small hotel owners, shack owners, watersports operators and guesthouse owners.
 But with tourism now at a standstill due to coronavirus pandemic, these people are relying on their savings or going back to these traditional occupations to earn a living.
 "We have been guiding and encouraging people to plant within their own backyards and kitchens or in whatever area they can find and teaching them techniques on what crops can be grown alongside others to help with the soil fixation," Miguel Braganza a professor of agriculture said.
 The arrival of the monsoons marks the sowing season in Goa much as in the rest of the country.
 The Goa government has set up a task force to recommend an economic revival plan for each village that is being anchored by the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development and the Directorate of Higher Education.
 In an initial document the committee has suggested all panchayats identify potential activities within the village which can provide livelihood to the people -- agriculture and allied activities, horticulture, poultry, dairy, fishing and reviving micro and small scale industries besides traditional livelihood options like artisans etc and a plan to process and market the products.
 However, challenges remain. Some have complained about lack of cooperation from local panchayat authorities and support from the government to help cultivate lands some of which have been fallow for a few decades.
 Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said that he expects the slowdown in tourism to be temporary.
 "Tourism may have dropped for now, but when tourism starts, Goa Tourism is in a better position to quickly rebound in comparison with the rest of the country and will scale new heights. We will bring in new concepts to promote tourism," Sawant said.

iPhone SE has A13 Bionic processor performance
 The longevity of Apple's iOS support for "older devices" is a quiet but significant appeal of owning an iPhone. The iPhone 8 and its A11 processor are now two-and-a-half years old and will likely stop receiving iOS software updates a couple years before the iPhone SE and its newer A13 Bionic processor.
 In performance tests, the iPhone SE was consistently better than the iPhone 8 and (no surprise) the original iPhone SE. It scored similar results to what we got on the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.
 In real life that meant app launches were peppy, playing games like Sky: Children of Light and Doomsday Vault were a breeze. Editing photos was easy and I could even use graphics-heavy AR apps such as Wonderscope, which transformed my bedroom into a training ground for ghosts.

Farmers are being asked to make as much of a racket as possible, using drums, tin containers, utensils and even hiring mobile disc jockeys, in an attempt to scare away locust swarms that are attacking India.Millions of locusts are invading several Indian states and there are concerns they might reach New Delhi, the capital. Some farmers have been playing loud music through speakers fitted on vehicles in a bid to frighten the insects, said Rahul Srivastava, a superintendent of police in Jhansi district, describing the mobile disc jockey systems normally used at weddings. Citizens have been keeping doors and windows closed to stop locusts entering into their homes."In the event of a locust attack, farmers are advised to collectively beat loud drums, tin containers, utensils and use loudspeakers to prevent locusts from descending on farms and damaging crops," Suhas L.Y., district magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar district, said on Twitter. The government is planning to spray pesticides during the night when locusts rest on trees, he said.Authorities have cleared locusts from about 50,468 hectares (124,709 acres) in several states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and Maharashtra, according to the federal agriculture ministry.A massive locust attack on the country's farms adds another challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, which is trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus and limit its impact on the economy. It cannot risk food crops getting destroyed by the insects at a time when millions have been pushed into poverty after losing their livelihoods because of the world's most stringent stay-at-home rules.Some summer pulses, early-sown cotton, vegetables and fruit plantations run the risk of destruction from the winged invaders. The silver lining is that the harvesting of winter crops is over and sowing for the monsoon season is yet to begin.Drones, ChoppersWhile officials in the affected states are working on measures to control locust swarms, the federal government is arranging drones to sprinkle pesticides on trees and inaccessible places to kill the insects. There are plans to deploy helicopters for aerial spraying, according to India's farm ministry.As many as 15 sprayers will start arriving from the U.K. in the next 15 days, followed by 45 more in one-and-a-half months, the farm ministry said Thursday, adding that affected states will be given financial aid, if required.Swarms of desert locusts occur irregularly in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, usually when drought is followed by heavy rain. Normally, with the arrival of the monsoon, locust swarms enter the desert areas of India via Pakistan for breeding in June-July, but this year pink adult swarms were reported as early as April 30 in Rajasthan and Punjab.This is in part because of the uncontrolled swarms in Pakistan that breed continuously, the ministry said earlier. Swarms of pink immature adults fly high and travel long distances with strong winds coming from Pakistan. Most of them settle on trees during the night and mostly fly during the day.Further AttacksThe locust movement was helped by strong westerly winds from Cyclone Amphan that hit eastern India last week, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. Several successive waves of invasions can be expected until July in Rajasthan. These movements will cease as swarms begin to breed and become less mobile. Swarms are less likely to reach south India, Nepal and Bangladesh, it said on its website.The control work is in full swing in coordination with states and the Border Security Force, the farm ministry said. There was no information regarding the entry of any new locust swarm from India-Pakistan border areas as of Thursday. However, locusts entered from Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan on Wednesday, with control operations going on, it said. There are some active swarms of immature locusts in some parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.In January, the biggest locust swarm to hit India's Gujarat in over a quarter of a century resulted in more than 25,000 hectares of wheat, rapeseed, cumin and potatoes being attacked, with at least a third of the crops damaged in 75% of the affected areas, according to the state's directorate of agriculture. A massive locust attack in 2019-20 saw about 403,488 hectares treated with pesticides, according to the federal farm ministry.

That closing stretch prompted then-NU Athletic Director Shawn Eichorst to dismiss the Huskers‚Äô win over Iowa two days later, after he‚Äôd fired coach Bo Pelini.
 ‚ÄúWe were not playing for a conference championship and neither was Iowa,‚Äù Eichorst said. ‚ÄúAnd I have great respect to Iowa, it is a wonderful institution and a great football program. But in the final analysis, their record was where it was and our record was where it was.‚Äù
 The words live in infamy now. But consider that Iowa was at the end of a five- year stretch in which it had compiled a 34-30 overall record. NU was 47-20 in that same time period. They weren‚Äôt the same programs then.
 They‚Äôre not the same programs now, either.

New Delhi: In the class 9 results of the 2019-2020 academic year declared Tuesday as per revised promotion policies, government schools in Delhi saw the highest pass percentage in at least five years, data accessed by Hindustan Times has revealed. In class 11, meanwhile, the pass percentage improved from last year's 84.8% to 96.2% this year.
 These figures are significant in light of the fact that the promotion of these students of these classes was based on a revised policy on the subject, outlined by the Directorate of Education as a one-time measure necessitated by the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease crisis as well as the riots which took place in northeast Delhi in February.
 Under this formula, the students of these classes who appeared for the exams were allotted grace marks to reach 33%, the passing bar, in the five main subjects. Earlier, a minimum of 25% marks was mandatory in the 60-marks' annual exam. The revised policy also stated that students who could not appear for their final exams due to the riots or the Covid-19 crisis be given marks proportional to their mid-term results.
 Going by the data, at least 64.5% of the 2,79,377 students of Delhi government schools who had appeared for class 9 exams for the 2019-20 academic year have been promoted to Class 10. The total number of students who appeared in class 9 exams this year was 4.4% more than last year, the data reveals.
 For class 11, the pass percentage is higher. Out of the 1,65,650 students of Delhi government schools who had appeared for the exams this year, around 96%, or 1,59,283 students, have been promoted. Last year, the pass percentage for class 11 was at 84.8%. The total number of students who appeared for the class 11 exams this year was 24% more than last year, the data reveals.
 "Marks are compiled on the basis of exams that were already conducted before the lockdown or the northeast Delhi disturbance. Apart from giving weightage for midterm and internal assessments, a maximum grace of 15 marks is given in one or more subjects together, keeping in view the special circumstances in which the students had to take exam this year," a senior government official said, asking not to be named.
 The students who could not be promoted under this revised promotion policy, however, will be given a chance to reappear in one or any number of subjects in which they could not clear the exam. "That re-examination is likely to be conducted in July 2020, for which the DOE will issue a date sheet soon," the official cited above added.
 Principals across government schools in the Capital, meanwhile, also acknowledged the jump in pass percentage of these classes.
 Awadhesh Kr Jha, principal of a government school in Rohini's Sector 8, said, "We've had student-friendly results this time and there has been a marked improvement in results from previous years. Students were also given grace marks keeping the stress of the pandemic in mind. In our school, the pass percentage for class 9 is around 10% better than last year. For class 11, it is even better as only eight students got compartment results. Earlier, this figure used to be 20-30 students."
 However, concerns over how students will perform in board exams next year remains. "We are concerned about how students will perform since they cannot come to school for regular classes. We are hoping to make up for the lost time once the Covid-19 pandemic situation is better so as to maintain the quality of the board results," Jha said.
 The school also plans to write to the education department to recommend classroom teaching for board students in July while maintaining staggered timings and social distancing measures, he said.
 "A reduction in the syllabus is actively being considered. So it is likely that the same syllabus won't have to be covered in a reduced timeframe," a senior education department official, requesting anonymity, said over the matter.
 Earlier in April, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia had written to the Union minister of human resource development to reduce the curriculum by 30%.
 Delhi government schools have been criticised for their poor pass percentages for class 9 in the past, owing to a number of reasons including low-learning levels in primary classes, lack of regular teachers, and the no-detention policy which did not allow schools to fail students until class 8. While the government has introduced certain learning interventions such as the Mission Buniyaad and Chunauti scheme to rectify this, critics say it has done little to improve pass percentage in higher classes.
 According to the 2019 Praja Foundation report around 55% of class 9 students of the 2016-17 academic year did not pass their annual exams. The corresponding number for class 12 was relatively lower at 24%, but still a drop of over 36,000 students.
 Addressing these concerns, a senior government official, on condition of anonymity, said, "Focus has to be on improving learning levels during primary classes. Class 6 onwards, the lessons get difficult for the child if they don't have basic foundational learning. This is what Mission Buniyaad is working on."

Spartanburg Community College is slowly transforming. Plexiglas dividers are installed at service desks, signs with reminders of the world's new rules are on doors, and wellness check forms are required to go farther into the campus than the student services' building lobby.
   
 While a few of the college's seniors have already returned to campus for the hands-on classes they need to graduate, more changes are still being made in anticipation of the slowly increasing numbers of students they plan to welcome in the coming weeks as summer classes begin.
   
 MORE REBUILDING AMERICA STORIES
   
 "We've ordered protective shields for the face-to-face kinds of areas, we've ordered masks, some gloves, and a lot of hand sanitizer so as faculty are working with students in these small groups, they still have protection. We are planning traffic patterns," said Dr. Cheryl Cox, SCC's senior vice president of academic affairs.
   
 Their first summer session, which started May 18, will be mainly online, while the second session, starting in June, will offer face-to-face courses. By fall, the college hopes to open to all students, though Cox said she anticipates a lot of students will still opt for the online courses.
   
 This staged reopening is being implemented at many local colleges, all of which aim to be on campus in the fall.
   
 Wofford College's first summer session, running June 1-July 2 will be entirely online and a decision regarding their second session, running July 6- Aug 6, will be made later in May. Similarly, Converse College will be running its first summer session, starting June 1, entirely online, while some classes in their second and third sessions may be on campus, with the decision to be made in June.
   
 Spartanburg Methodist College, Limestone College and USC Upstate's summer course schedules will be entirely online.
   
 Spartanburg's K-12 schools have more time to figure out what their summer is going to look like, with most not dismissing until the first week of June.
   
 Superintendents are receiving more instruction from the state board of education about what guidelines summer schools and camps will need to follow. Discussions of the fall during the governor's April 22 press conference included ideas of using the first few weeks as a review to make sure students are on track for their new grade.
   
 "Right now, there are many scenarios being considered but no firm plans yet," said D7 Chief Communications Officer Beth Lancaster of summer plans.
   
 Private schools have begun making plans. Oakbrook Preparatory School spokeswoman Amanda Ledbetter said the school has decided to cancel most of the summer camps they typically offer. They are planning to hold any camps they may offer and their summer athletics program later in the summer than usual. Summer work and reading assignments are also being handled differently because of the coronavirus.
   
 Lee Healy, spokeswoman for Spartanburg Day School, said the school's summer camps have been canceled for June, but they are discussing options for starting in July or later.
   
 The summer camp organizers have also started announcing their decisions. Meghan Smith and Savannah Ray of Spartanburg Academic Movement's  Out of School Time Collaborative said they'd heard back from many of their community partners.
   
 "We're still meeting individually with programs just to nail down what they plan to do, but from what we've heard so far, the majority are doing virtual and those who are thinking about in-person, still keeping it very small so they can adhere to the social distancing guidelines," Ray said.
   
 For example, B.A.R.S Academy and My Brother's Keeper will be offering their camps and courses online for the first time. While Cassie Lloyd, director of mission advancement for YMCA of Greater Spartanburg, said their current plan is also to go forward with in-person camps while following state guidelines and recommendations.
   
 During their current daycare services for children of essential workers, the YMCA is focusing on outdoor activities that encourage social distancing, like fishing, hiking, and cycling, which would likely continue during the summer.
   
 "We know that being outdoors and socially distanced is one of the healthiest things that we can do right now," Lloyd said.
   
 Groups are also working with the anticipation of additional need for financial assistance. B.A.R.S. Academy and My Brother's Keeper will be working with the Out of School Time Collaborative to provide scholarships for their digital offerings, while the YMCA is doing a push for donations so they can provide more scholarship assistance.
   
 The biggest takeaway for parents? Don't assume that there won't be any opportunities for their child this summer.
   
 "I don't think anything's out of the question at this point, with things changing from day to day. I don't want to say anything's out of the question, but I think the goal is that you still have the opportunity to engage in a quality summer program and that even in this environment, (the children) still feel that they are connected with other youth, that they're connected with caring, trusted adults," Ray said.

The Singapore court has dismissed appeals made by the former Fortis promoters duo challenging a 2016 arbitral award of Rs 3,500 crore against them and in favor of Japanese drugmaker Daiichi, CNBC reported.
 The Singapore Court of Appeals is the highest court in the country. Hence, the duo cannot challenge the order further.
 In 2008, Daiichi had purchased 34.82 per cent stake held by Singh brothers, for a consideration of $2.4 billion. However, The United States Food and Drug Administration had launched a series of investigations against Ranbaxy after a whistleblower complaint that the company falsified the data to accelerate drug approvals. Daiichi remained unknown to the development.
 In 2011, after the Daiichi took over the shares, the investigations culminated in payment of a settlement sum of $500 million.
 In 2012, Daiichi alleged that Singh brothers concealed the data and information about the ongoing USFDA investigation and initiated arbitration proceedings.
 In April 2016, the arbitration tribunal in Singapore had awarded damages of Rs 3,500 cr in favor of Daiichi, payable by Singh brothers.
 Singh brothers, who have been facing execution proceedings in India for payment to the tune of Rs 3,500 crore arbitral award, had cited pending challenges in Singapore‚Äôs higher courts to stall payment.
 Representing Daiichi Sankyo, Managing Partner of P&A Law Offices, Anand Pathank said as cited in the CNBC report: ‚ÄúThis judgment has brought finality to the appeal proceedings in this case. We can now proceed forward with focused enforcement of the Arbitral Award and to recover for our client, Daiichi Sankyo. This is also the first time the Supreme Court in Singapore has admitted Indian lawyers to argue a matter, and this victory is a great achievement for Daiichi Sankyo, the Indian Bar and for all the lawyers who worked for Daiichi Sankyo in this case.‚Äù
 Currently, Singh Brothers are incarcerated in Tihar Jail, New Delhi, after a complaint filed by Religare Finvest with the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police, for causing wrongful losses of Rs 2,397 crore.
 The Supreme Court has also held the Singh brothers guilty of contempt of court for violating SC orders by diluting stake in Fortis Healthcare. The SC had allowed them to get the contempt charges dropped after paying back to Daiichi.
 Meanwhile, the due is also facing execution proceedings in the Delhi HC, with the October 2019 order. The order asked them to pay the Rs 3,500 crore, as per the arbitral award, CNBC report added.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî U.S. consumer spending plunged by a record- shattering 13.6% in April as the viral pandemic shuttered businesses, forced millions of layoffs and sent the economy into a deep recession.Last month's spending decline was far worse than the revised 6.9% drop in March, which itself had set a record for the steepest one-month fall in records dating to 1959. Friday's Commerce Department figures reinforced evidence that the economy is gripped by the worst downturn in decades, with consumers unable or too anxious to spend much.Even with employers cutting millions of jobs during the month, personal incomes soared 10.5% in April, reflecting billions of dollars in support through government payments in the form of unemployment benefits and stimulus checks.The depth of the spending drop is particularly damaging because consumer spending is the primary driver of the economy, accounting for about 70% of economic activity. Last month's figure signaled that the April-June quarter will be especially grim, with the economy thought to be shrinking at an annual rate near 40%. That would be, by far, the worst quarterly contraction on record.Friday's report showed sharp declines in consumer spending across the board ‚Äî from durable goods like cars to non- durable items such as clothing and services ranging from doctor visits to haircuts.In April, the nation's jobless rate was 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression, and many economists think it will top 20% for May. States are gradually restarting their economies by letting some businesses reopen with certain restrictions, and some laid-off employees are being recalled to work. Still, the job market remains severely depressed, and the outlook for the rest of the year is still bleak.Some financial support for the tens of millions of consumers who have been laid off over the past two months is coming from weekly unemployment benefits. Besides whatever unemployment aid states are providing to laid-off workers, the federal government is providing $600 a week in additional benefits.A debate in Congress over whether to extend the $600 a week in federal unemployment aid looks sure to intensify, with the number of people receiving that aid now topping 30 million ‚Äî one in five workers. The money is set to expire July 31. Yet with the unemployment rate widely expected to still be in the mid-teens by then, lawmakers will face pressure to compromise on some form of renewed benefits.The Trump administration asserts that the economy will begin to regain its health in the second half of the year, with businesses increasingly reopening and restoring jobs and consumers increasing spending. Most economists say, though, that the lingering effects of the job losses and likely business bankruptcies will take longer to overcome, especially if a second wave of the coronavirus erupts. Analysts generally believe the economy won't manage to sustain a solid recovery until a vaccine is widely available.And until Americans resume spending at something close to their previous levels, jobs won't likely return in a significant way. Data from Chase Bank credit and debit cards shows that consumers have slowly increased their spending since the government distributed $1,200 stimulus checks in mid-April.But most of that increase has occurred in online shopping. Spending in regular brick and mortar stores, which makes up the vast majority of consumer spending, is still down 35% from a year ago, according to Chase, after having plummeted 50% at its lowest point.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Boras told his players ‚Äúthe game can not be played without you‚Äù and asked them to share the concept with teammates and opposing players when ‚ÄúMLB requests further concessions or deferral of salaries‚Äù during negotiations.


  ‚ÄúLet owners take some of their record revenues and profits from the past several years and pay you the prorated salaries you agreed to accept or let them borrow against the asset values they created from the use of those profits players generated,‚Äù he wrote.


  The only team Boras cited was the Cubs, who are owned by the Ricketts family and valued at $3.2 billion, according to Forbes. Boras pointed to debt financing in the purchase of the team in 2009 and the subsequent renovations of Wrigley Field and development near the ballpark.


  ‚ÄúThroughout this process, they will be able to claim that they never had any profits because those profits went to pay off their loans,‚Äù Boras wrote. ‚ÄúHowever, the end result is that the Ricketts will own improved assets that significantly increases the value of the Cubs ‚Äî value that is not shared with the players.‚Äù


  The Rickettses‚Äô real estate company, Hickory Street Capital, built and leases the Hotel Zachary, several restaurants and businesses, an office building and Gallagher Way, the plaza adjacent to Wrigley Field. The Ricketts family owns 11 rooftop clubs. The Hickory Street Capital assets generate millions in combined revenues that don‚Äôt go into the team.


  The Cubs responded to the Boras memo by pointing to the team‚Äôs high payroll and ballpark renovations.


  ‚ÄúThe Ricketts family invested $750 million to save iconic Wrigley Field for fans today and for future generations,‚Äù Ricketts family spokesman Dennis Culloton said in a statement to the Tribune. ‚ÄúAt every level they‚Äôve built the best player facilities in the game. In 2019, the Cubs had one of the top baseball payrolls in the game. The fact of the matter is 70 percent of the team‚Äôs revenues which support the baseball operations come from having fans in the ballpark. Nevertheless, we thank Mr. Boras for weighing in.‚Äù


  The Associated Press, citing an MLB document, recently reported the Cubs would potentially lose $199 million paying prorated salaries to its players during an 82-game season in an empty Wrigley Field. Only the Yankees, Dodgers and Mets would lose more, according to the document. The Cubs declined to comment on the report.
