“My father gave me space when I moved out after marriage and I give Ranbir his space too when he decided to move out. In this house, he had one room: how could that be enough for a 33-year-old boy?

I know I’ve screwed up my relationship with Ranbir even though my wife kept telling me about what I was doing. It’s now too late to change it; both of us will not be able to adjust to the change.

To resolve this, the researchers created the additional layer on top of the Lithium anode, to prevent the formation of these deposits. Explaining the benefits, Bhargav and Nanda state, "The layer formed on lithium surface allows it to operate without breaking down the electrolyte, and that makes the battery last much longer. The stabilizing layer is formed by a simple in-situ process and requires no expensive or complicated pre-treatment or coating procedures on the lithium-metal anode." A provisional patent has been filed by the researchers for this breakthrough.

With this achievement, Li-S batteries come one step closer to commercial deployment, and technically, can extend the life of a smartphone per charge cycle by days. Furthermore, the advantage of using Sulphur in the battery means that it is far lighter than conventional Li-ion batteries in use right now. Plus, the widespread availability of Sulphur means that the batteries will be cost efficient, too. However, Manthiram clarifies that the Li-S batteries are not ready for prime time action just yet.
