Today people immediately consider "arms" to be guns. But in the long run-up to American independence -- in medieval, pre-colonial and colonial times -- arms for "bearing" were usually edged weapons, especially swords.

Berg views phoning as the best substitute for that direct communication with voters. She said her approach is more scripted.
 When you're at someone's home, you have visual and audio cues, explained political consultant Christian Sinderman. Is there a baby crying in the background? Another candidate's yard sign in front? Or maybe really nice rose bushes you can use as a conversation starter?
 On the phone, Berg has also found, voters aren’t as quick to share what’s on their minds. But she tries to stay conversational. “I make sure I’m always smiling.”
 She also smiles a lot when she’s doing her livestreamed “kitchen conversations.” Like Vaska, she invites guests via Zoom. Her biggest hit, drawing more than 800 views, was a conversation entitled “Black in the ‘Burbs,” which reflects her reality as a Black woman living in Snohomish County for 23 years.
 Sometimes her shows get only a few dozen views, but hey, in normal times she would hold campaign get-togethers in coffee shops and 10 to 15 people would show up.
 Early on, Berg realized she would need to rethink every topic she planned to focus on — transportation, health care, education — in light of the pandemic. Instead of just advocating for more public transportation, she’d have to consider how to keep drivers and passengers safe. When it comes to schools, the topic of her latest kitchen conversation, she'd have to address plans for reopening and finding adequate personal protective equipment.

Lawyer Mike Vaska, head of Mainstream Republicans of Washington, planned to announce a challenge to state Attorney General Bob Ferguson in mid-March. Just then, Inslee let it be known that he was planning to curtail gatherings in light of the coronavirus, the reality of which was sinking in weeks after the U.S.’ then-first known death from the disease happened in Washington.
 Vaska waited some days and called former Gov. Dan Evans, a mentor, for advice. “I never had to run in a pandemic,” Vaska remembered Evans telling him. “There’s no playbook. You just have to make it up.”
 Vaska, 59, said he embraced the challenge and jumped in.
 He went to a couple of rallies, including one in a wheat field where he said no one was wearing masks. “Frankly, I was pretty uncomfortable,” he said, and decided, “OK, I think that’s it.”

Our greatest teacher, Audrey Ramona Anderson, departed our Earth-side world on July 11, 2020, in the early hours at her residence in Touchmark in Helena, Montana, at the age of 92.


  Her lessons will be forever felt.


  Audrey was raised in Westby, Montana. It was in this town of humble western beginnings that the Liningers and Andersons made their home.


  In a part of the country noted for its brutal winters, rapid weather change, and challenging terrain, Audrey grew up the eldest of four children. She looked after her siblings, gaining the moniker as the “second mother.” Audrey, her siblings, parents, and grandfather shared a one-bedroom house. The kids slept four to the living room, while her mother and father slept in the bedroom and Grandpa Ellingson slept in the kitchen on a roll-away bed. The family shared the space until Audrey graduated school. The modest, rustic quarters did see its share of improvements over time. Additions such as a built-on bedroom and separate wash house were notable improvements. The wash house held fondness, especially when the family could fill a barrel, place it on top of the house, and take a shower.

Pushing yourself into doing something that makes you uncomfortable is a mistake. Your gut is trying to tell you something; listen to it. If you’re being pressured to give help that you don’t want to provide, say no. If you are judged for your personal choices, stand by those decisions. People are often intimidated by your pioneer spirit; they worry that if you rebel, others will follow suit. You’re not responsible for anyone's behavior but your own. When you are true to yourself, regret becomes a thing of the past.

The head of Cumberland County Schools will recommend to the Board of Education that classes meet online when the school year begins next month, a spokesman for the school system said Friday.


   


  Marvin Connelly Jr. will ask the board to approve the plan for remote instruction only during a special meeting Tuesday morning, according to Lindsay Whitley, the spokesman.


   


  "The safety of our students and staff is our top priority," Connelly said in a news release. "Over the last few days, we have received several health and safety concerns about the opening of schools. As promised, we have continued to monitor the situation and will use data to make informed decisions for our students and staff, in consultation with local health officials."


   


  The recommendation comes after school officials had been planning to offer parents three choices, which included meeting in-person on a part-time basis. The other options were remote learning through the student's school or enrolling in a virtual academy that would continue meeting online through the school year.


   


  Classes are scheduled to begin Aug. 17.


   


  The proposal for starting the year completely online was one of three possibilities for reopening schools that a Reentry Task Force presented to the school board in a meeting July 9. The task force recommended a separate plan, which gave parents the three options. The third consideration was to have all students who weren't in the virtual academy meet partially in-person.


   


  The online proposal includes meal pick-up sites and the delivery of some meals. It also calls for mental health support for students and for remote learning training for teachers.


   


  The district is exploring ways to provide multiple student orientation options and device pick-up opportunities, the release said.


   


  Classes in the schools met online during the last several months of the 2019-20 school year because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The disease, which is caused by a highly infectious coronavirus, has killed more than 135,000 people in the United States.


   


  Families are still encouraged to complete the district's re-entry enrollment form through Sunday, the release said. If the board decides to move forward with remote-learning only, data received from the survey will help officials plan for a possible shift to a combined schedule later in the school year as the spread of the coronavirus subsides.


   


  "Delaying the implementation of Plan B (blended face-to-face and remote instruction) until later in the school year will provide more opportunities for us to watch coronavirus trends in Cumberland County and prepare to tackle the challenges of executing such a model," Connelly said.

Europa superó en la última jornada la barrera de los tres millones de casos, aunque la región más afectada del mundo sigue siendo América, con 7,3 millones, mientras que Oriente Medio y el sur de Asía registran 1,3 millones cada una. Más del 80 por ciento de los fallecimientos se siguen concentrando en América y Europa, con unos 302.000 en el primero de estos continentes y 205.000 en el segundo, siempre según las estadísticas de la OMS. Estados Unidos es el país más afectado en el planeta, con 3,5 millones de casos, seguido de Brasil, que hoy superó la barrera de los 2 millones, India (un millón de contagios), Rusia (759.000), Perú (341.000), Chile (326.000) y Sudáfrica (324.200), que acaba de adelantar a México (324.000).

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.


  Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.


  In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

It is why we Coloradans go around politicians and pass citizen initiatives to rein in their ability to hide what they do. Politicians just hate these citizen reforms, even though they have to say they like them.


  We’ve passed open records laws, open meetings laws, term limits, and the best we-don’t-quite-trust-you-politicians law in the state, our Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights.


  The idea of TABOR is straight forward — you must ask us before you raise taxes or debt, that’s it.


  TABOR is described by one single word — consent.


  You’d think politicians would get the idea and stop going behind our backs. If you politicians want more of our money, please have the dignity to look us taxpayers in the eyes and ask like consenting adults.


  But they can’t seem to help themselves. This year it was House Bill 1420, slammed through in the closing moments of their artificially extended legislative session.


  It is an utterly confusing bill for any layman to read, written in perfect bureaucratese. Its purpose is simple enough — get more money into the state coffers without directly asking voters.


  HB-1420 will bring almost $100 million in increased tax revenue in the next year alone, of course without your blessing. It does so by changing what businesses can deduct from their taxes. It doesn’t allow businesses to deduct a lot of their net operating losses they incurred during this government- mandated COVID lockdown madness.


  In keeping with the progressive goal of punishing the most successful, it also disallows some deductions for people who make more than $500,000. Class envy is all the rage these days among the political elite running our state.


  The state has an impressive record of raising taxes without a vote of those who will be paying for it. Their most favored ploy was made possible by our TABOR-hating state Supreme Court that ruled if politicians call a tax increase a “fee” then they don’t have to go to the voters.


  So, in the last double of decades while voters have given a resounding no to tax increases at the ballot box the Legislature has given a resounding yes to raising taxes all the same by calling them fees.

There were plenty of acorns this spring, and now the chipmunks are driving people nuts.


   


  Their frenetic activities can be entertaining. But this summer in New England the varmints are making a nuisance of themselves, darting to and fro, digging holes in gardens, and tunneling under lawns.


   


  Plentiful acorns last fall meant there was still plenty of food on the ground when the chipmunks emerged from winter and got busy breeding this spring, said Shevenell Webb, a small mammal biologist with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.


   


  The result is a bumper crop of the critters.


   


  "They're cute. They're fun to watch in the forest as they duck in and out of the holes and play peekaboo," Webb said. When their cheeks aren't bulging with nuts, chipmunks make a distinctive "chip" sound, she said.


   


  But they're also destructive. They can destroy lawns and gardens with their burrowing, and can even get into homes, Webb said.


   


  "We can't grow a tulip without them digging it up," Steven Parren, wildlife program diversity manager for the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, said of the chipmunks in his yard. "They don't even pause."


   


  There were so many acorns in one of the areas that he monitors that the rodents that rely on them couldn't stash them all away for the winter. Plenty remained on the ground this spring. In addition to chipmunks, he said, he's seeing more squirrels, rabbits and a variety of different kinds of mice.


   


  People needn't get too alarmed over an overpopulation. Small mammal populations tend to explode, then crash and burn.


   


  Such is life near the bottom of the food chain, where food supply ebbs and flows and chipmunks are easy prey for owls, hawks, snakes, foxes and raccoons. Even if their lives aren't cut short, individual chipmunks tend to live only for three years, Webb said.


   


  Many New Englanders recall a similar spike in squirrel populations in 2018 in New England. The boom-and-bust cycle was punctuated by a memorable number of road kills.


   


  "We've never seen anything like that. That was a once in a lifetime event," Webb said.

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.


  Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.


  Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

Vaska said he has not taken a position, except that he believes as someone running for attorney general, he should follow the law. But the show has let him question the order without violating it. During his most recent episode, he asserted the need to balance public health and jobs, and suggested the state was being run as a “banana republic,” with no time limit on the governor's use of emergency power or input from the Legislature. He promised to serve as a watchdog if elected.
 “I’m having fun with it,” Vaska said of the "suppers." But he misses the ability to read a crowd and get feedback, as he did when he ran for attorney general in 2004. After giving a speech at one event about the number of lawsuit payouts the state was making, someone came up to him afterward and said it was good but needed to be trimmed, a lot.
 Following that advice “really made a difference,” Vaska said, though he lost in the end.
 Similarly, Berg said she’s feels the loss of the kind of events she’s used to attending as a school board candidate, such as last year's July Fourth parade in downtown Everett. Mingling among thousands of voters, she handed out T-shirts and flyers.
 “It gets people to know who you are, and honestly to know you’re a real candidate,” said the Mill Creek Democrat. The same goes for when voters see you at their door, handing out campaign literature.
 She has talked at a couple of Black Lives Matter rallies, where people generally wore masks, but didn't directly campaign and has otherwise steered clear of physical interactions, she said.

Aaron and Ellen Sargent already were advocates for voting rights for women when they met Susan B. Anthony, pioneer crusader for the woman suffrage movement, in early January 1872 on board a train headed from Nevada to Washington, D.C.. Their conversations, prolonged because the train was stalled in deep snow drifts in the Rockies, led to a friendship that lasted for many years. All three had passed away prior to the 1920 ratification.

She loved coffee. Whether it was waking up at dawn and greeting the day with a cup, or sipping on decaf throughout the day. She loved to socialize with her friends and family with a warm mug in her hand, swapping stories between sips.


  Audrey was fiercely proud of her family -- and she kept up on all of their affairs. With so much noise in the world, Audrey remained focused on her family, friends, and community. She knew all about what sports they played, where her family branched out, what jobs they were working, or what education they were pursuing and kept up on their relationships. She loved to tell others about her family, enjoying every success or sharing any heartbreak. She loved to be in the loop -- and you would hear about it if you didn’t keep her up-to-date!
