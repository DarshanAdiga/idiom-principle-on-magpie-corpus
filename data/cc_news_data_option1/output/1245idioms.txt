NEW YORK (AP) — Country singer Joe Diffie, who had a string of hits in the 1990s with chart-topping ballads and honky-tonk singles like “Home” and “Pickup Man,” has died after testing positive for COVID-19. He was 61.
 Diffie on Friday announced he had contracted the coronavirus, becoming the first country star to go public with such a diagnosis. Diffie's publicist Scott Adkins said the singer died Sunday due to complications from the virus.
 Diffie, a native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, was a member of the Grand Ole Opry for more than 25 years. His hits included “Honky Tonk Attitude," “Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox (If I Die)," “Bigger Than the Beatles" and “If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets).”
 His mid-90s albums “Honkey Tonk Attitude” and “Third Rock From the Sun” went platinum. Eighteen of Diffie's singles landed in the top 10, with five going No. 1. In his 2013 single “1994,” Jason Aldean name-checked the '90s country mainstay.
 Diffie is survived by his wife, Theresa Crump, and five children from his four marriages.

Nearly 51 migrant labourers were sent back from Igatpuri to Mumbai after they thought a train standing at the station was bound for Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.
 The labourers had reached Igatpuri on trucks and were in the vicinity of the station, when the train arrived on Sunday. Central Railway (CR) was running an empty rake from Mumbai and had contract workers of various railway departments on board the train.
 According to sources, the rake’s eventual destination was Gorakhpur, which is its originating point, but it was to be stationed in Bhusaval yard before being sent to Gorakhpur.
 “Since all trains were stopped, we were facing an issue of space at our yards in Mumbai. This rake originates from Gorakhpur and hence it was decided to run it empty till there with a halt at Bhusaval. Since we also had move a few workers to Bhusaval as well as a few who belong to Gorakhpur, they were on board the train,” a senior railway official said on condition of anonymity.
 The issue cropped up at Igatpuri, where the train halted around 9 a.m. Other migrant workers stranded near the station entered, which was noticed by railway employees. Sources said since these workers had come from Mumbai and the railway authorities were not comfortable with evicting them, it was decided to return the rake to the city.
 The rake left for Mumbai around 2 p.m. and reached Dadar station at 6 p.m. where the migrant labourers were handed over to the district administration. Arti Singh, Superintendent of Police, Nashik (Rural), said the local administration had not been informed by the railway authorities regarding the movement of the rake and only learnt about the development after local railway authorities informed them.
 “Passenger train movement is shut till April 14. People are requested not to believe in rumours about such trains being run. We are running freight trains to supply essential commodities to various parts of India,” said chief public relations officer, CR, Shivaji Sutar.

LUCKNOW Politicians, who are usually accused of paying lip service to various causes and eyeing photo ops, are quietly helping the poor and the harassed migrant workers who are stuck because of the Covid-19 lockdown.While many politicians have ordered cadres to ready food packets for the poor, some like UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh are busy preparing meals for those in distress."See, it's a global scare. We all need to do whatever we can to help the poor. So, while the cadres have set up community kitchen, I too thought of doing my bit by making food for the poor. There can't be a bigger satisfaction than feeding the hungry," Singh says.Swatantra Dev has also donated his two months' salary along with Rs 10 million (Rs 1 crore) from his MLA fund. Samajwadi Party's national spokesman Rajiv Rai has directed medical shops in Mau and Ballia in eastern UP to provide medicines to the poor, even if they are unable to pay."If any poor person comes to you for masks or medicines and is genuinely unable to make payments, please send the bill to me and I will make the payment," Rai has told the owners of medicine shops.UP basic education minister Satish Dwivedi connects with the masses of his Itwa assembly segment on Facebook daily."I am told that many are still overcharging people, be it for rations, essentials or medicines. This is happening despite clear directions of the state government, and efforts being made by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is monitoring the situation round the clock, holding meetings late into the night," he says."I am told even vegetables are being sold for lot more than what they should be. I have taken note of this and surely things would be set right," Dwivedi adds.Another minister Mohsin Raza too has been connecting with people on Facebook. Devmani Dwivedi, the BJP lawmaker from Lambhua in Sultanpur, has penned a poem to make people aware of the dangers that the virus poses and the need for a joint, coordinated effort against it.In Fatehpur, Congress workers have set up a community kitchen. In Etawah, the Congress cadres are distributing fruits to migrant workers on their way to villages.In Agra, Congress district chief Manoj Dixit has started serving morning tea to passers-by."Our party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi has set up a WhatsApp group, which she is monitoring and accordingly providing help on the basis of feedback she is getting," says UP Congress leader DP Singh. "The Samajwadi Party cadres under the direction of party chief Akhilesh Yadav are active across the state. You can check with migrant labourers coming into UP from Delhi if they have met with people wearing red caps who have offered them food, besides making them aware of the need to maintain social distancing," says Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leaders have also been using their MLA and MP funds to help boost health infrastructure.

NEW DELHI: Two soldiers, including an army doctor, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday at a time the force is taking aggressive measures to tackle the spread of the disease within its ranks, two army officers said on condition of anonymity.
 While the doctor is a colonel posted at the Kolkata-based Eastern Command hospital, the other soldier is a junior commissioned officer in Dehradun, said the first officer cited above.
 "Both had history of domestic travel in the first/second week of March. Necessary contact tracing is being done and identified persons have been quarantined. The two affected persons are keeping good health and are stable," said the second officer cited above.
 The colonel, 52, travelled from New Delhi to Kolkata by flight on March 17 and showed symptoms of Covid-19 a few days ago after which he was tested and found to be positive. The JCO, who is 47, travelled from Delhi to Jhunjhunu on February 25 and from Jhunjhunu to Chakrata near Dehradun on March 10.
 He was admitted to a hospital in Chakrata on March 25 after he showed symptoms and shifted to the military hospital in Dehradun on March 26.
 The two new cases come days after a 34-year-old soldier tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Leh on March 18, becoming the first case in the army. The soldier from Ladakh Scouts has recovered.
 The army, which is at the forefront of the country's fight against the pandemic, has taken a raft of preventive measures to stop the spread of the infection within its ranks.
 These measures include cancellation of all non-essential training, conferences and travel, a freeze on postings and foreign assignments, avoiding any assembly that involves more than 50 personnel, postponing all courses for officers and encouraging personnel to work from home wherever possible.

Chuck Kissner, 72, a technology executive in Los Altos, California, who administers a computer network for his extended family and maintains their 40 or so devices with security updates and software licenses, said he recently had a deluge of requests for tech assistance from his neighbors.
 Last week, he spent several hours using remote access to the devices of his homeowner association board to help members, who range in age from about 65 to 85, figure out how to attend a virtual meeting.
 One neighbor and board member sanitized his iPad and left it at Kissner’s front door. The neighbor was having trouble logging into his Apple iCloud account because he could not remember the password. Kissner could not get into the account, and the neighbor eventually sought support from Apple.
 “Everyone got into the meeting,” Kissner said. “It’s great to see the reaction when it works and it seems so simple.”
 After Quinn’s family helped her get on Zoom, she told her book club about the videoconferences. While some were excited about keeping the club going online during the outbreak, others didn’t want to try it, she said.

 Her family has certainly embraced the Zoom calls. Jackson Gode, 23, one of Quinn’s grandsons, lives in Washington, D.C., and used to text her a few times a month. Now they video chat more frequently, he said.

In her order, Gee said the plaintiffs had a strong likelihood of succeeding with their claim that both ICE and the refugee resettlement office had breached the Flores agreement by failing to release minors in a prompt manner, especially in light of the widening coronavirus outbreak.
 The court found that the Office of Refugee Resettlement “appears to be in substantial compliance” with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for protecting children from the threat of disease. But it found that ICE, which operates two facilities in Texas and one in Pennsylvania, “appears deficient.”
 The agency had not included social distancing, increased personal hygiene or coronavirus testing as part of its protocol for detainees as of March 15, when reports were submitted to the court.
 Nor did it recognize the potential psychological harm of quarantining or isolating children for disease-control purposes, the court said, adding that recent observations showed “uneven implementation” of recommended public- health measures.
 Last week, the refugee office said it had halted placements of unaccompanied children in California, New York and Washington, where there have been large outbreaks of the coronavirus. It also reported that several staff members at shelters for migrant children had been diagnosed with COVID-19.

All migrant workers-- either homebound or staying at a state-run shelter in the cities- must be screened for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Centre has told directed state governments, and those who have already left the cities for their home state will serve a mandatory 14 days in quarantine at their destinations.
 The workers will be screened and quarantined on the basis of their risk score, calculated on the basis of their age, co-morbid conditions and history of contact with people who may have travelled abroad or may be Covid-19 patients or suspected to be carrying the virus.
 "Like we did passenger screening at the airports, similarly we will also do risk profiling of these migrant workers. Depending on the risk score, they will be accordingly quarantined," Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, said at a press conference.
 "Directions have been given to all states in this regard," he added.
 The Centre on Sunday issued a formal order directing state governments and Union Territories (UT) administrations to effectively seal state and district borders to stop the movement of migrant workers during the 21-day lockdown period ending April 14.
 Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, during a video conference, asked chief secretaries and directors-general of police (DGPs) to ensure there is no movement of people across cities or on highways when the lockdown is in force. And the states have been directed to, accordingly, make arrangements for the food, shelter and other necessities of migrant workers.
 In the absence of a source of income, and landlords evicting them, thousands of migrant workers have been moving across borders on foot towards their hometowns. Most of them could be seen carrying children on their shoulders and even elderly parents on their backs. Many hadn't had a full meal in days, largely surviving on food distributed by good Samaritans.
 "Only goods vehicle should be moving across borders; no migrant worker should be on the roads. There have been special arrangements suggested for migrant workers that the states and UTs will have to follow," said Punya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary, home ministry.
 District magistrates and superintendents of police have also been directed to look into the issue and make adequate arrangements for implementation of these directions by the central government.
 "Government is taking all possible measures to handle this issue. Directions have been issued to the states to provide food and shelter to the stranded migrant workers, and those who have already left for their home states will have to be placed under a minimum of 14 days' quarantine at the point of destination under standard healthcare protocol," she added.

Locked Up: No Masks, Sanitizer as Virus Spreads Behind Bars


--DocBreak--
A human tragedy of untold magnitude is unfolding before our eyes, bringing back painful memories of Partition. Covid-19 and the lockdown by the central and the state governments has led to one of the greatest migrations in human history. In an attempt to stem the spread of this deadly contagion, the curfew and the lockdown across the nation has thrown up a new set of real and potential victims.Daily wagers and migrant labour are bearing the brunt of the shutdown in ways that we, sitting in comfort, cannot even fathom. With the countrywide curfew and the attendant stoppage of all forms of public transport, this multitude of daily wagers and itinerant labour along with their families have taken to the highways, risking a desperate trek covering hundreds of miles - without the means to reach their villages. News pours in of their tribulations, of hungry children and of some succumbing to death due to exhaustion. For the below poverty line population, the struggle is for daily food and shelter. Today, it is their desperate desire to return to their homes, having been abandoned by employers who have shutdown operations, and by landlords who have perhaps coerced them to vacate.Their hope is that in their distant villages they would have access to food, shelter and survival. With the shutdown and sealing of state and district borders, they are now trapped in a no-man's land, in their own country. When the Prime Minister in his first speech requested the private sector to be generous to its employees and ensure payment of salaries, it was perhaps hoped that the social and economic impact of this lockdown would be contained. But for that, the states had to plan and act in collaboration with each other and for the Centre to coordinate with the states to ensure containment and care of this vast segment of Indians. Containment by police alone is not the solution.Saturday' scenes at Anand Vihar ISBT at Delhi, showed a fraction of numbers on the move. The tragedy that may unfold if such movement of people is not contained in time by the State Governments reaching out with food, aid and shelter, may be of far greater proportions. It is a given that this mass migration may, and will result in transmission of the infection to villages, where medical facilities are scant and mostly absent.While there has been sporadic action by some state governments in easing food supplies and opening government buildings to the population on the move, each state administration must ensure food, shelter, medical care and safety to the scared populace. The state governments (who it is believed were on board prior to the lockdown), especially those which export interstate migrant labour ought to have not limited themselves to the clampdown, but should have thought ahead of this anticipated mass movement of people. Under Schedule VII of the Indian Constitution, public health, sanitation, public transportation, relief to disabled and unemployed, markets, production supply and distribution of food, water supplies are all matters within the jurisdiction of the state governments. In the past few days we have seen mainly NGOs, individuals and private institutions reach out to local authorities to provide essential food and care to the poor.Today, there is no place in India which is not impacted by the consequences of the shutdown. It is imperative for the states therefore to ensure that a cohesive and coherent strategy both within each state, with adjoining states and with the Centre is formulated within next 12 - 24 hours to prevent the greatest disaster of our times. It is not to say that the state governments are bereft of experience. Large scale movement of kanwariyas (pilgrims) traversing Rajasthan, UP, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Delhi on foot, with tents along highways to provide food, toilets, water and resting places, and vehicles patrolling at roads to pick up the sick and infirm is one example of state action. Kumbh melas are another such example.With public transport buses no longer plying or reduced services, there is idle capacity which is available for emergency services. There are empty schools and colleges and other buildings which can be converted into camps providing shelter and access to toilets. The lockdown has also resulted in supply chains being disrupted hindering the movement of food, medical supplies and essential life saving equipment. Trucks and goods carriers are said to be parked at State borders awaiting clearance to move. The next 24 hours are crucial, and if the state administrations don't act now by providing assurance, food, water, toilets, shelter to these now homeless migrants, the human cost will be immense and posterity will never forgive our generation. With all the resources at their command, it is the imperative need of the hour for state governments to act and for the Centre to coordinate and to work cohesively to ensure that lives are not lost to starvation and diseases in 2020, while we battle Covid-19.Just as the manner of Partition was termed among the "follies of empire" by the scholar Yasmin Khan, we can only hope that this lockdown, which started as an essential life saving measure, should not be termed the "Folly of 2020".(Sidharth Luthra is former Additional Solicitor General of India, and Ketaki Gaswami is a lawyer)

A human tragedy of untold magnitude is unfolding before our eyes, bringing back painful memories of Partition. Covid-19 and the lockdown by the central and the state governments has led to one of the greatest migrations in human history. In an attempt to stem the spread of this deadly contagion, the curfew and the lockdown across the nation has thrown up a new set of real and potential victims.
 Daily wagers and migrant labour are bearing the brunt of the shutdown in ways that we, sitting in comfort, cannot even fathom. With the countrywide curfew and the attendant stoppage of all forms of public transport, this multitude of daily wagers and itinerant labour along with their families have taken to the highways, risking a desperate trek covering hundreds of miles - without the means to reach their villages. News pours in of their tribulations, of hungry children and of some succumbing to death due to exhaustion.
 For the below poverty line population, the struggle is for daily food and shelter. Today, it is their desperate desire to return to their homes, having been abandoned by employers who have shutdown operations, and by landlords who have perhaps coerced them to vacate.
 Their hope is that in their distant villages they would have access to food, shelter and survival. With the shutdown and sealing of state and district borders, they are now trapped in a no-man's land, in their own country.
 When the Prime Minister in his first speech requested the private sector to be generous to its employees and ensure payment of salaries, it was perhaps hoped that the social and economic impact of this lockdown would be contained. But for that, the states had to plan and act in collaboration with each other and for the Centre to coordinate with the states to ensure containment and care of this vast segment of Indians. Containment by police alone is not the solution.
 Saturday' scenes at Anand Vihar ISBT at Delhi, showed a fraction of numbers on the move. The tragedy that may unfold if such movement of people is not contained in time by the State Governments reaching out with food, aid and shelter, may be of far greater proportions. It is a given that this mass migration may, and will result in transmission of the infection to villages, where medical facilities are scant and mostly absent.
 While there has been sporadic action by some state governments in easing food supplies and opening government buildings to the population on the move, each state administration must ensure food, shelter, medical care and safety to the scared populace. The state governments (who it is believed were on board prior to the lockdown), especially those which export interstate migrant labour ought to have not limited themselves to the clampdown, but should have thought ahead of this anticipated mass movement of people.
 Under Schedule VII of the Indian Constitution, public health, sanitation, public transportation, relief to disabled and unemployed, markets, production supply and distribution of food, water supplies are all matters within the jurisdiction of the state governments. In the past few days we have seen mainly NGOs, individuals and private institutions reach out to local authorities to provide essential food and care to the poor.
 Today, there is no place in India which is not impacted by the consequences of the shutdown. It is imperative for the states therefore to ensure that a cohesive and coherent strategy both within each state, with adjoining states and with the Centre is formulated within next 12 - 24 hours to prevent the greatest disaster of our times. It is not to say that the state governments are bereft of experience. Large scale movement of kanwariyas (pilgrims) traversing Rajasthan, UP, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Delhi on foot, with tents along highways to provide food, toilets, water and resting places, and vehicles patrolling at roads to pick up the sick and infirm is one example of state action. Kumbh melas are another such example.
 With public transport buses no longer plying or reduced services, there is idle capacity which is available for emergency services. There are empty schools and colleges and other buildings which can be converted into camps providing shelter and access to toilets. The lockdown has also resulted in supply chains being disrupted hindering the movement of food, medical supplies and essential life saving equipment. Trucks and goods carriers are said to be parked at State borders awaiting clearance to move.
 The next 24 hours are crucial, and if the state administrations don't act now by providing assurance, food, water, toilets, shelter to these now homeless migrants, the human cost will be immense and posterity will never forgive our generation. With all the resources at their command, it is the imperative need of the hour for state governments to act and for the Centre to coordinate and to work cohesively to ensure that lives are not lost to starvation and diseases in 2020, while we battle Covid-19.
 Just as the manner of Partition was termed among the "follies of empire" by the scholar Yasmin Khan, we can only hope that this lockdown, which started as an essential life saving measure, should not be termed the "Folly of 2020".

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's president on Sunday lashed out at criticism of authorities' lagging response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East, saying the government has to weigh economic concerns as it takes measures to contain the pandemic.Syria meanwhile reported the first fatality from the virus in the war-torn country, which has five confirmed infections. State news agency SANA said a woman died upon reaching an emergency room and tested positive for the virus, without saying where it happened.Syria has closed schools, restaurants and nightclubs, and imposed a nighttime curfew last week aimed at preventing the virus' spread. Its health care system has been battered by nearly a decade of civil war, leaving the country particularly vulnerable.Libya, which has also been mired in chaos since 2011, reported another five cases, bringing its total to eight. The country is split by rival governments, each backed by an array of militias, that have been battling over the capital, Tripoli, for nearly a year.Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said authorities had to consider the effect of mass quarantine efforts on Iran's beleaguered economy, which is under heavy U.S. sanctions. It's a dilemma playing out across the globe, as leaders struggle to strike a balance between restricting human contact and keeping their economies from crashing.“Health is a principle for us, but the production and security of society is also a principle for us," Rouhani said at a Cabinet meeting. “We must put these principles together to reach a final decision."“This is not the time to gather followers,” he added. “This is not a time for political war.”Even before the pandemic, Rouhani was under fire for the unraveling of the 2015 nuclear deal he concluded with the United States and other world powers. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement and has imposed crippling sanctions on Iran that prevent it from selling oil on international markets. Iran has rejected U.S. offers of humanitarian aid.State TV on Sunday reported another 123 deaths, pushing Iran's overall toll to 2,640 amid 38,309 confirmed cases.Most people suffer only minor symptoms, such as fever and coughing, and recover within a few weeks. But the virus can cause severe illness and death, especially in elderly patients or those with underlying health problems. It is highly contagious, and can be spread by those showing no symptoms.In recent days, Iran has ordered the closure of nonessential businesses and banned travel between cities. But those measures came long after other countries in the region imposed more sweeping lockdowns. Many Iranians are still flouting orders to stay home in what could reflect widespread distrust of authorities.Iran has urged the international community to lift sanctions and is seeking a $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.Elsewhere in the region, Qatar reported its first death from the new coronavirus late Saturday, saying the total number of reported cases there was at least 590.The tiny, energy-rich nation said it flew 31 Bahrainis stranded in Iran into Doha on a state-run Qatar Airways flight. But since Bahrain is one of four Arab countries that have been boycotting Qatar in a political dispute since 2017, Doha said it could not fly the 31 onward to the island kingdom.“Bahraini officials have said they will send a flight for them at some undefined point in the future,” the Qatari government said in a statement.Bahrain said it planned a flight Sunday to pick up the stranded passengers. The kingdom said it had its own repatriation flights scheduled for those still stuck in Iran and warned Qatar that it “should stop interfering with these flights.”In Egypt, at least 1,200 Sudanese are stranded at the border after Sudan closed all its crossings, according to Egyptian officials at one of the crossings. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.Sudan, which is still reeling from the uprising that toppled President Omar al-Bashir last year, has six confirmed cases, including one fatality. It's one of several countries in the region where the health care system has been degraded by years of war and sanctions. Authorities closed the borders to prevent any further spread.Sudan’s Information Minister Faisal Saleh said Sudanese authorities are looking for lodging in Egypt for the stranded passengers. He said authorities have quarantined at least 160 undocumented migrants who were sent into Sudan from war-torn Libya earlier this month.Residents in Egypt’s southern city of Luxor say they are providing shelter to the stranded Sudanese.“We have provided food and medicine to the Sudanese brothers," said Mahmoud Abdel-Rahim, a local farmer. “People hosted women, children and elders in their homes.”Egypt, which has reported 609 cases and 40 fatalities, imposed restrictions on cash deposits and withdrawals to prevent crowding at banks as payrolls and pensions are disbursed. Authorities began imposing a nighttime curfew last week.___Aji reported from Damascus, Syria.

People-smuggling rackets seem to be the next big thing amidst the panic spawned from the ongoing lockdown after black marketing. The Saki Naka police, in the early hours of Sunday, busted one such racket, rescuing 64 people and booking two.
 According to the police, the truck was stopped for a search during routine nakabandi in Saki Naka around 3 a.m.
 “While the driver initially claimed that he was ferrying essentials, a closer inspection revealed that 64 people were packed in its back compartment with almost no space left, even to breathe. They were made to alight and we made inquiries, after which we found out that they were daily wage labourers,” an officer, who was part of the operation, said.
 The officer said the workers, after running out of options for earning a livelihood in light of the lockdown, had opted to pay to get smuggled to their native place.
 “The labourers had paid ₹2,500 per head to be dropped till U.P. as they had no other transport options available. Some of them were initially going to walk as far as they could and hitch rides wherever possible but weren’t sure they would be able to do so in light of the nakabandis and health concerns.” the officer said.
 The police then counselled the workers and sent them back home, while also contacting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to arrange for food and rations to last them for the time being.
 “Meanwhile, the truck driver, Amjad Ali Shah (32), and owner, Ali Razaak Shah (35), were booked for disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant and negligence likely to spread infection of a disease under the Indian Penal Code along with sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act and the police are conducting further inquiries,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone X) Ankit Goyal said.
 Also known as human-smuggling rackets, the offences are among the top serious concerns in the U.S., where illegal migrants from various countries are smuggled in boats and trucks under extremely inhuman conditions into the country’s borders, often leading to loss of life.

There's nothing good about the coronavirus pandemic, but maybe there can be collateral benefits. For example, it's already forcing people to use the technology that everybody should have embraced already.
 With legacy systems like email now creaking under the strain of work-from-home edicts, the time has come to leap into the future. We abandoned the fax machine (mostly) and no longer print out emails to read them (I hope). We can all adopt modern office-collaboration technology, too, if senior managers would get on board with technologies they've avoided using for years.
 It's not as though digital collaboration tools are untested novelties. Slack has been around since 2014 and videoconferencing companies like Zoom (2011) and Skype (2003) have been around even longer. FaceTime has been available on iPhones for a decade. Google Docs has been out of beta since 2009.
 These tools, and others, are beloved by geographically distributed teams for good reason. They're built for precisely the moment in which we face ourselves now: isolated and hobbled by subpar Wi-Fi speeds and personal laptops with limited memory and processing power.
 Virtual-collaboration tools are no longer the domain of early adopters, but essentials that everyday workers in thousands of companies use without thinking twice. Google Drive has more than a billion users, and Zoom has 13 million monthly active users. Slack is up to 12 million daily active users.
 But for every enthusiastic user, there seem to be six workplace laggards who think it will be "too much work" to "add one more system" — by which they seem to mean "learn to use something other than email."


--DocBreak--
Email is not up to this moment. It's a tool that hasn't moved at the pace of business in at least 10 years.
 If, over the past week, you've found yourself reduced to begging employees to stop replying-all, or refrain from clogging inboxes with messages such as "Thanks," know that your pleas are doomed to fail. The medium shapes the message, and a chat program is a better way for now virtual teams to communicate synchronously and transparently.
 Plus, it's probably not a great time to advise employees to stop saying "thank you" — with everyone working feverishly to keep their companies afloat, tempers fraying from being cooped up with children and spouses, and fear about a deadly disease spreading, we should all be expressing more gratitude, not less. Find a medium that works for the messages people need to share, rather than demanding that people force their message to conform to the limits of the medium.
 That's not to say that old technologies can't be useful, too. The telephone is a good way to touch base one-on-one and add a human element to solitary days. But the phone doesn't scale. If your team is having trouble coordinating, phone calls probably aren't going to help. Audio-only conference calls are unwieldy and hard to manage — you have to get the introverts to talk, the extroverts to stop filibustering, and everyone else to stop catching up on email.
 Video calls make it much easier to pick up on the nonverbal cues, even if it's something as small as seeing that someone else is trying to get a word in. And the comfort of seeing other human faces is welcome just now. Moreover, if your face is visible, you're unlikely to have the alarming experience of hearing a colleague start to talk about you, having forgotten that you were on the call.
 We are making progress. People who've resisted installing Slack are asking for help downloading it; those who never bothered with Zoom are posting photos of the snazzy backgrounds they've chosen for their video calls. Together, we're learning to mute ourselves when we're not talking, reducing the steady background cacophony of heavy breathing, weird echoes and VERY LOUD TYPING.

Something was wrong. The chow hall line at New York's Rikers Island jail had halted. For three hours, the men stood and waited, without food, until a correctional officer quietly delivered the news: A civilian chef was among those who tested positive for the new coronavirus.
 "We was like, 'What? The cook?'" said Corey Young, who spoke to The Associated Press last week by phone from Rikers. He and others wondered if the chef had sneezed on trays or into the food. Some men later floated the idea of a hunger strike to protest.
 "I don't want to eat nothing that comes from the state," Young said. "They are not going to take care of us properly here."
 Health experts say prisons and jails are considered a potential epicenter for America's coronavirus pandemic. They are little cities hidden behind tall fences where many people share cells, sit elbow-to-elbow at dining areas and are herded through halls to the yard or prison industry jobs.
 They say it's nearly impossible to keep 6 feet away from anyone, adding to tensions. Medical services behind bars have long been substandard and even hand sanitizer is considered contraband in some facilities because of its alcohol content.
 More than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the United States -- more than anywhere else in the world. But the threat posed by COVID-19 behind bars extends well beyond prison walls. Even though most personal visits have been stopped, hundreds of thousands of guards, wardens and other correctional facility administrators go in and out 24 hours a day, potentially carrying the virus home to their families and communities.
 And -- as the incarcerated understand better than anyone -- jail and prison employees are also the ones most likely to bring the virus into overflowing facilities already grappling with older men and women, those suffering from chronic health conditions and the mentally ill.
 The first positive tests from inside America's correctional facilities started trickling out two weeks ago, with more than 350 cases now confirmed in New York, California, Michigan, Alabama and a dozen other states.
 But information and transparency about the number of infections are lacking, and some in custody are afraid to report symptoms because they've seen others being placed in solitary confinement for doing so, several men said in interviews with the AP. Many correctional departments across the country do not even identify affected facilities, let alone name those who test positive, citing privacy concerns.
 Most of the coronavirus cases in jails and prisons so far have been reported from New York City, with the Department of Corrections saying Saturday that one of its longest-serving officers passed away at a local hospital and that 104 staff and 132 men in custody have now tested positive at Rikers and city jails alone -- five times what was reported just a week ago.
 'Unequipped to handle it'
 Homer Venters, former chief medical officer of the New York City jail system, said the rise in infection rates at Rikers Island foreshadows what's to come elsewhere.
 "America's 7,000 jails, prisons, juvenile and immigration detention centers are completely unequipped to handle this pandemic," he said.
 He called for authorities to "rapidly empty these facilities of everyone with risk factors for serious illness and death, and create pathways to hospital- level care." If nothing is done, he said, people will die and the virus will spread faster.
 Already, New York, Ohio, Florida and a handful of other states have started letting some people out -- the elderly, pre-trial detainees, those being held on technical violations and low-level offenders who are at high-risk of severe illness. But some health advocates say thousands more need to be freed. Meanwhile, youth justice groups in nearly two dozen states are also calling for the release of detained and incarcerated juveniles and a halt to new admissions.
 However, new men and women continue to cycle in and out of the prison system and others are still being transferred in crowded vans between facilities, sometimes across state lines. All increasing the chances the virus will spread.
 With little information coming from within correctional facilities or from the outside world, those inside often try to figure out who's been infected on their own. Sometimes they learn about it from jail staff members, who have weighed orders to remain silent with their own concerns about the health of inmates and staff, the men say. Others make assumptions after vague memos about COVID-19 infections are posted in their units and a guard, cook or someone in their unit suddenly disappears after showing flu-like symptoms.
 "It's like we are expendable," said Nascimento Blair, incarcerated at Fishkill Correctional Facility in upstate New York, where one staff infection was officially confirmed and prisoners have been informed about three others. "The last thing you want is to be around someone and not know that that person has it, because that's a potential catastrophe."
 He said one officer had returned from a cruise vacation and was coughing and showing other flu-like symptoms in common areas. That person was eventually sent home, but only after a few days.
 "Now we don't even know if we've been exposed," he said. "And how do you run from this?"
 However, protocols on paper for dealing with infectious diseases behind bars do not always translate into reality. Even the simplest guidelines like hand washing and social distancing are often impossible to follow inside. Some men also reported shortages of soap and toilet paper.
 "We should be given masks and hand sanitizer," said Blair, who got a master's degree while behind bars. "No one is going to drink sanitizer. I seriously doubt anyone is going to do that. We should be able to help ourselves anyway we can."
 So far, most of the confirmed cases in prisons and jails across America have been correctional officers, staff and civilian employees. Sometimes, incarcerated men known to have come into contact with infected people are sent to segregation or to their cells -- whether they have a bunk mate or not.
 But more often, it's just business as usual. Several men told the AP they are trying their best to take care of themselves, washing their hands as much as possible and wiping down surfaces. Without masks, some people improvise by covering the receiver of communal phones with a sock or wearing gloves used for sports to try to keep from picking up germs.
 'Throwing you in the hole'
 Elijah Prioleau, who is locked up at Waupun Correctional Institution in Wisconsin on a three-year revocation after serving 16 years in the state's prisons, said sick people are not being tested.
 Instead, he said they are sent to another part of the jail, even though there are still healthy prisoners housed there. If someone who is sick refuses to be moved out of fear that they may infect others there, he said the only alternative is segregation, or solitary confinement -- a place no one wants to go.
 "As far as the quarantine goes, it's a joke," Prioleau said on a call with the nonprofit Forum For Understanding Prisons posted on Facebook Live. "They putting you in seg. They're throwing you in the hole and quarantining you if you refuse to go over there."
 He added that the men are also not being given enough cleaning supplies, and that guards and prisoners do not have any protective gear so some are forced to improvise.
 "I got on handball gloves right now holding the phone," Prioleau said, adding many men were coughing and sneezing in his tier.
 Visits from friends, relatives and, in most cases, lawyers have all but stopped, making it harder to get information in and out. Though some prisoners have access to phones, and at times now a few free calls, many say they are more isolated than ever.
 "Guys are just idle, waiting for the next shoe to drop," said Rickey Fu-Quan McGee, 42, who's serving a life sentence at MCI-Norfolk, a prison in Massachusetts. With so many men suffering from mental health issues, he said he's concerned about their well-being. "No one's coming around asking guys how they're dealing with it. … This can be a very volatile environment, but you have a lot of seasoned guys walking around checking on everyone, making sure everyone's good."
 In states, such as Minnesota, with no confirmed cases inside prisons, everyone is nervous and doing their best to protect themselves.
 "The same rules that apply out there should apply here," said Antonio Williams, who is serving time at the state's Rush City Correctional Facility, about an hour north of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area.
 He said he and others are paying careful attention to the guidelines issued in the outside world, even though they are all but impossible to follow inside.
 "Meeting between 10 or more people should be restricted, right?" Williams said. "They force us to the chow hall. Literally elbow to elbow. If it comes here, it's gonna spread like wildfire."

BOSTON -- The highest court in Massachusetts has reinstated some child rape charges against a former theater teacher at a prestigious private school.
 Former Milton Academy teacher Reynold Buono pleaded not guilty in June 2018 to three counts of rape of a child and three counts of forcible rape of a child involving one student. The allegations date to the early 1980s. Buono, now in his mid-70s, was fired in 1987 and moved to Thailand.
 A Superior Court judge dismissed the charges in January 2019, saying prosecutors failed to meet the evidentiary threshold required of cases that exceed the 27-year statute of limitations.
 The Supreme Judicial Court on Thursday reinstated two counts of forcible rape of a child and two counts of rape of a child.
 "We conclude that the Commonwealth presented adequate corroborating evidence to meet the grand jury's probable cause to indict standard," the court wrote.
 Messages were left with Buono's attorney, Inga Bernstein.
 Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey welcomed the ruling in a statement and said his office will now bring the case to a trial "to seek justice for his alleged victim."
 Buono's alleged victim, a now 53-year-old Portsmouth, New Hampshire, resident, told The Patriot Ledger he was pleased by the decision.
 The case had a Framingham link. When Buono was released on bail in August 2018, an assistant district attorney asked for clarification on whether she could discuss Buono's address with police departments, victims and witnesses. The judge replied that she could tell "Framingham Police Department."

Many proposals have been suggested, including playing the 2019-20 season over the summer months and delaying the start of the next campaign.
 Kane is against that idea, saying there will come a time when a decision will need to be made.
 “I know the Premier League will do anything it can to finish the season,” the England captain told Jamie Redknapp in an interview on Instagram Live.
 “There needs to be a point where enough is enough. Probably the time limit for me is the end of June.
 “Playing into July or August and pushing next season back, I don’t see too much benefit in that.”
 Cancelling the season would be unprecedented, but the FA has already voided the 2019-20 edition of all leagues at the National League level and below.
 Kane conceded he had no idea what the potential financial impact on clubs would be, but said that the game’s governing body must make a call, come what may.
 “Obviously I don’t know too much about behind the scenes and financially,” the striker added.
 “If the season’s not completed by the end of June we need to look at the options and just look forward to next season.”
 Kane’s thoughts are in line with those of UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, who has also said the season must start before the end of June or be lost entirely.

Politicians, who are usually accused of paying lip service to various causes and eyeing photo ops, are quietly helping the poor and the harassed migrant workers who are stuck because of the Covid-19 lockdown.
 While many politicians have ordered cadres to ready food packets for the poor, some like UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh are busy preparing meals for those in distress.
 "See, it's a global scare. We all need to do whatever we can to help the poor. So, while the cadres have set up community kitchen, I too thought of doing my bit by making food for the poor. There can't be a bigger satisfaction than feeding the hungry," Singh says.
 Swatantra Dev has also donated his two months' salary along with Rs 10 million (Rs 1 crore) from his MLA fund.
 Samajwadi Party's national spokesman Rajiv Rai has directed medical shops in Mau and Ballia in eastern UP to provide medicines to the poor, even if they are unable to pay.
 "If any poor person comes to you for masks or medicines and is genuinely unable to make payments, please send the bill to me and I will make the payment," Rai has told the owners of medicine shops.
 UP basic education minister Satish Dwivedi connects with the masses of his Itwa assembly segment on Facebook daily.
 "I am told that many are still overcharging people, be it for rations, essentials or medicines. This is happening despite clear directions of the state government, and efforts being made by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is monitoring the situation round the clock, holding meetings late into the night," he says.
 "I am told even vegetables are being sold for lot more than what they should be. I have taken note of this and surely things would be set right," Dwivedi adds.
 Another minister Mohsin Raza too has been connecting with people on Facebook.
 Devmani Dwivedi, the BJP lawmaker from Lambhua in Sultanpur, has penned a poem to make people aware of the dangers that the virus poses and the need for a joint, coordinated effort against it.
 In Fatehpur, Congress workers have set up a community kitchen. In Etawah, the Congress cadres are distributing fruits to migrant workers on their way to villages.
 In Agra, Congress district chief Manoj Dixit has started serving morning tea to passers-by.
 "Our party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi has set up a WhatsApp group, which she is monitoring and accordingly providing help on the basis of feedback she is getting," says UP Congress leader DP Singh.
 "The Samajwadi Party cadres under the direction of party chief Akhilesh Yadav are active across the state. You can check with migrant labourers coming into UP from Delhi if they have met with people wearing red caps who have offered them food, besides making them aware of the need to maintain social distancing," says Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh.
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leaders have also been using their MLA and MP funds to help boost health infrastructure.

Palermo, 29 mar. (Adnkronos) - Si è concluso poco fa a Siracusa il Comitato provinciale per l'ordine e la sicurezza pubblica convocato dal prefetto Giusi Scaduto, al quale hanno preso parte anche l'assessore regionale alla Salute, Ruggero Razza, e il sindaco del capoluogo, Francesco Italia. L'incontro, preceduto da una nota a firma del primo cittadino, è stata l'occasione per affrontare le criticità emerse nel corso della prima fase dell'emergenza coronavirus, anche alla luce dei recenti fatti di cronaca e della nota diffusa alla stampa da parte delle organizzazioni sindacali.
 L'assessore regionale alla Salute "ha preso atto della richiesta di un maggior coinvolgimento di tutte le amministrazioni locali e ne ha condivido lo spirito". Sul fronte assistenziale, come già disposto per situazioni analoghe, si é impegnato a sostenere l'Asp e l'ospedale cittadino con ulteriori professionalità, anche per garantire il massimo del supporto a tutti gli operatori e l'adeguata sicurezza delle prestazioni lavorative.
 Nella giornata di domani sarà costituto dall'assessorato regionale un Covid team per valutare i percorsi seguiti per i pazienti positivi e per riportare la necessaria serenità tra gli operatori.

All migrant workers-- either homebound or staying at a state- run shelter in the cities- must be screened for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Centre has told directed state governments, and those who have already left the cities for their home state will serve a mandatory 14 days in quarantine at their destinations.The workers will be screened and quarantined on the basis of their risk score, calculated on the basis of their age, co- morbid conditions and history of contact with people who may have travelled abroad or may be Covid-19 patients or suspected to be carrying the virus. "Like we did passenger screening at the airports, similarly we will also do risk profiling of these migrant workers. Depending on the risk score, they will be accordingly quarantined," Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, said at a press conference."Directions have been given to all states in this regard," he added.The Centre on Sunday issued a formal order directing state governments and Union Territories (UT) administrations to effectively seal state and district borders to stop the movement of migrant workers during the 21-day lockdown period ending April 14.Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, during a video conference, asked chief secretaries and directors-general of police (DGPs) to ensure there is no movement of people across cities or on highways when the lockdown is in force. And the states have been directed to, accordingly, make arrangements for the food, shelter and other necessities of migrant workers.In the absence of a source of income, and landlords evicting them, thousands of migrant workers have been moving across borders on foot towards their hometowns. Most of them could be seen carrying children on their shoulders and even elderly parents on their backs. Many hadn't had a full meal in days, largely surviving on food distributed by good Samaritans."Only goods vehicle should be moving across borders; no migrant worker should be on the roads. There have been special arrangements suggested for migrant workers that the states and UTs will have to follow," said Punya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary, home ministry.District magistrates and superintendents of police have also been directed to look into the issue and make adequate arrangements for implementation of these directions by the central government."Government is taking all possible measures to handle this issue. Directions have been issued to the states to provide food and shelter to the stranded migrant workers, and those who have already left for their home states will have to be placed under a minimum of 14 days' quarantine at the point of destination under standard healthcare protocol," she added.
