In pochi giorni si sono raccolti migliaia di euro: «Sono piccole donazioni per lo piu, da cinque o dieci euro. Questo ci fa capire che per sentirsi coinvolti in questo progetto non serve donare chi lo sa che cifra. Va detto che in tanti ci vogliono dare una mano a realizzare questo murales di 21 metri. Ognuno ci mettera del suo». Non lo dice ma anche il suo apporto non sara retribuito. Del progetto fa parte anche il CSV che con gli street artist ha stretto una relazione molto concreta  dove nove writers padovani hanno messo a disposizione la loro arte, delle stampe nello specifico, per finanziare il centro servizi volontariato.

Amber Heard has told a court Johnny Depp hurled 30 glass bottles at her in a rage before stubbing a cigarette out on his own cheek.
 Heard, 34, is back at London's High Court for her second day giving evidence in Depp 's libel case against News Group Newspapers.
 Depp, 57, is suing NGN over a story published in The Sun in 2018 which branded him a "wife beater" \- a claim which he strenuously denies.
 The actress has been questioned about a 2015 trip to Australia, which she described in court today as a "three day hostage rage".
 Depp claims he was left with a severed finger when Heard threw a bottle at him during one heated row.
 However, during questioning today Heard claim it was Depp hurling bottles at her like "grenades and bombs" before stubbing a cigarette out on his cheek.
 She said: "[He threw] one after the other, right in my direction. I felt glass breaking behind me. I retreated more... he didn't stop.
 "He threw all the bottles that were in reach - all except one. 30 or so.
 "I was too scared to look behind me."

Kanye West has been dropping bombshell after bombshell on social media over the past 48 hours.
 The rapper, 43, who is hoping to be elected as the next president of America in November, has been worrying fans with a number of erratic Tweets - which included him claiming that his wife Kim Kardashian tried to get doctors to lock him up amid fears he's in the middle of a serious bipolar episode.
 In one of his now-deleted tweets, the Yeezy brand owner claimed that he has been trying to end his marriage with reality TV star Kim after she met with musician Meek Mill at a hotel to discuss prison reform.
