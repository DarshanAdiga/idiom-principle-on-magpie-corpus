MANKATO, Minn. (KEYC) — The cancellation of all remaining NCAA winter and spring tournaments due to concerns over the coronavirus means the second ranked MSU men’s hockey team’s season comes to an abrupt halt in a year filled with success for one of the nation’s top squads.“If there is one word that I’d use to describe the group that we called the 19/20 team is selfless,” said MSU head coach, Mike Hastings.The Mavericks finished this season with an impressive 31-5-2 record. MSU never lost three games in a row, and the program earned the number one ranking in the nation for the first time since 2015. The Mavericks were supposed to be taking the ice Friday night against Michigan Tech in the WCHA semifinals, but that all quickly changed as the NCAA announced all remaining winter and spring tournaments were canceled earlier in the week.“Coming around the corner in the locker room and getting in there when the guys were sitting there, and I was going to have to tell them that the season was no longer is one piece. But the second piece is that if this is the worst thing that happens to the group in there and other teams that are out there, they are going to be fortunate because life is tough, it’s hard. We talk about student-athletes, people in general going through a lot of things that teach you to be mentally tough and fight through things. Right now, the concern is the unknown, and trying to take care of the bigger picture, our society and having this not grow anymore. Can we get ahead of it, and that’s the next step. The idea of not having a game to play at the end of the day, it’s a game. Life is a bigger game, so we’re going to try and focus on what we can do to stop the spread of the coronavirus and everything that comes along with it,” said Hastings.And coach Hastings had one final message for those seniors that helped set new program records and reach a couple of NCAA tournaments.“First of all, thank you, and the appreciation for what they’ve done up until this point, and continue to challenge them to help us move forward in what they’re going to do in their next step of professional hockey or life and continue to fly the Mav flag and what it stands for,” said Hastings.As of now, the Maverick hockey program will take things day by day as the situation continues to change.Copyright 2020 KEYC.

The pricier $880 and $1,010 SKUs each boast Core i7-10510U Comet Lake chips, 8GB and 16GB of RAM, and 512GB and 1TB SSDs, respectively. All three laptops come equipped with 14-inch full-HD touchscreens that feature Dolby Vision HDR, which is designed to deliver high-contrast images.
 Overall, our Yoga C740 unit is a pretty solid configuration for a $790 system. While the quad-core Comet Lake CPU doesn’t offer a dramatic boost over previous-gen Whiskey Lake chips, it should still deliver more than enough horsepower for everyday computing needs, along with some added oomph for video encoding and other processor-intensive activities. The 8GB of RAM is standard for a laptop in this price range and should help to smooth over any multitasking bumps, while the 512GB SSD is roomy enough to install plenty of apps along with a modest media collection. The full-HD display should have wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS (in-plane switching) technology, while the Dolby Vision HDR should give visuals some added pop.
 We’re also impressed that this 2-in-1 laptop weighs only three pounds. We generally expect similar-sized convertibles in this price range to weigh closer to four pounds.
 ## Design
 Lenovo sticks with the tried and true when it comes to the Yoga C740’s design. The update boasts the same smooth, fingerprint-resistant lid and tapered left and right sides as previous Yoga models. Of course, the C740 also boasts the familiar Yoga 360-degree hinge, which lets you swivel the laptop’s display all the way around for tablet use, tent it on a tabletop, or place it with the keyboard facing down and the screen tilted up.

Maricopa County in Arizona, the second-largest district in the country after Los Angeles County, relocated polling locations out of senior living facilities after conferring with local health experts, said Megan Gilbertson, communications director for the county’s elections department.
 Confusion swirled in the county Friday as Recorder Adrian Fontes announced that he would try to mail ballots to all voters who had not voted early, adding that officials had been unable to obtain enough cleaning supplies to keep voting sites safe. But Arizona’s secretary of state questioned whether such a move was legal, according to the Arizona Republic.
 In Leon County, Fla., poll workers will remind voters to stand slightly apart, and each location will have hand sanitizer available.
 “Our contingency plans have contingency plans,” said Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley, who witnessed the 2000 presidential recount as well as polling at locations with roofs ripped off by Hurricane Charlie in 2004. “We always try and stay ready.”
 Still, campaigns and grass-roots organizers are scrambling to figure out how to adjust their on-the-ground operations to reach voters, who may be focused on dealing with everyday challenges presented by the pandemic.
 Nabilah Islam, a Democrat who is running for Congress in Georgia’s 7th District northeast of Atlanta, made the decision Thursday to cancel in-person canvassing for her volunteers and staff.
 She said she is among those who do not have health insurance, and is worried about getting sick. “It was a tough decision to make, but your health is your wealth, and so I want to make sure they’re protected,” she said.
 But wealth is wealth, too: With about 70 days to go until she faces off against five other Democrats, Islam said she’s trying to figure out a way to campaign and fundraise virtually. She said she had met most of her small- dollar donors at meet-and-greet events, but those have been canceled, as have candidate forums.
 “At the end of the day, you can’t replace face-to-face contact,” Islam said. “Phone banking and text banking is supplemental, but knocking on doors is the best way to talk to voters about your campaign and earn their vote.”
 Advocacy groups that do similar door-to-door and other in-person campaign work face similar safety challenges.
 “I have a lot of field operations all across the nation, and I need to decide when to pull the trigger” on pulling staff off the streets, said Hector Sanchez Barba, CEO and executive director of Mi Familia Vota, a Latino advocacy group. “This could have a drastic impact on our operations, and obviously we want to get as much done as possible before we close shop.”
 For communities that have often felt ignored by political candidates, “face- to-face interaction is so critical [to] the establishment of trust,” Sanchez Barba said. Just as important, the virus has arrived when “there’s so much on the line” in the presidential election, he added.
 “It’s a top priority to make sure we have better leadership and we remove hate and violence from the White House,” Sanchez Barba said. “So the question is, how is this coronavirus affecting our democracy?”

That’s because Linux under WSL2 is largely text-based. While there are methods to enable a Linux GUI, most require some interaction between WSL2 and Windows 10, and a remote connection between the two. By and large, WSL2 is designed for text-editing apps like vim and emacs, according to Microsoft employees working on WSL2. as well as text-based “apps” like Nethack, as Microsoft’s own tutorial shows off.
 Terminal’s clean, modern, pleasant to use, and doesn’t get in your way—all prerequisites for a text editor. But it’s not perfect, either: For one thing, how functions are split between PowerShell, the Command Prompt, and Linux is confusing. Why does enabling the paned view below require the command to be entered into the Command Line box, rather than PowerShell? It may be obvious to an advanced user, but not to one who’s new to the environment.
