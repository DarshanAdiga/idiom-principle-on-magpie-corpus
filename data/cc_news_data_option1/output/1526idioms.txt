Members of Dalit Lekhakaru, Kalavidara Yuvaka Sangha held a candle light procession in the town on Sunday night to pay tributes to the rape and murder victim Dalit girl Danamma of Vijayapura.
 Wearing masks symbolising evil forces in the society, the protesters took out a procession, holding candles, from Nachiketa Nilaya up to B.R. Ambedkar statue at Bangarpet Circle.
 Addressing the participants, writer and activist Kotiganahalli Ramaiah regretted the oppression on Dalit people even after seven decades of independence. “If Dalit girls have to walk freely in the society they need to wield guns for self-protection”, Mr. Ramaiah said. “Other girls also may have to face the same fate as that of Danamma if society maintains silence over the issue. People should come to the streets to avoid recurrence of such heinous crimes against women.”
 He urged the government to issue licences to possess guns in order to protect the Dalit womenfolk.
 Dr. L. Basavaraju Trust president C. Lakshminarayan, Kannada Sahitya Parishat’s former district honorary secretary Ashwath Reddy, and lecturers G. Shivappa and C.A. Ramesh participated.

In the summer of 430 BCE, a ship from Egypt arrived in Piraeus with an uninvited guest on board: "the plague." The symptoms of this yet-to-be- identiﬁed disease - hypotheses range from typhoid fever to viral hemorrhagic fever - are described by the historian Thucydides, who was infected and survived. They included extreme headache, redness and inﬂammation of the eyes, bloody throats and tongues, repellent breath, sneezing, hoarseness and cough, pain in the stomach causing vomiting, reddish and livid bodies covered with pimples and welts, high fever, and thirst. The fever killed most patients within seven to nine days, others died later from weakness. Some patients are reported to have lost their sight, or even genitals, ﬁngers and toes. It is estimated that the disease killed more than 50,000 people. The doctors who attempted to treat it were its ﬁrst casualties; the most prominent victim was none other than Pericles, the creator of the homonymous Golden Age of Athens.

Healthcare workers are at high risk, as they have to work in a high viral load environment. To safeguard medical personnel deployed in COVID-19 treatment clinics, the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) has developed cost- effective and quality-certified fabric-based personal protective suits. NAL, along with MAF Clothing Private Limited, has developed these suits.
 "The major advantages of these coveralls are that they are highly competitive in price as compared to other manufacturers and the import content is negligible," Jitendra J Jadhav, Director, CSIR-NAL. The cost of the product is Rs 500-600 per piece as compared to those available in the market at Rs 2,000-3,000 per piece.
 “We found polyproplylene spun-laminated, multi-layered non-woven fabric as the best material for making the coverall or suits after testing a lot of fabric materials,” said Dr Harish C Barshilia, Chief Scientist, NAL.
 The non-woven fabrics are engineered fabrics that may have a limited life. Although it can used only once, the fabric stands the test of durability very well. Known for its sterility, non-woven fabrics also have the ability to repel liquids, and bar bacteria. The joints of the suits have been sealed with innovative manufacturing processes by using slide machines so that neither blood nor virus can penetrate the coverall.
 In the first week, 5,000 units would be manufactured, in the second to third week the production would be scaled up to 10,000 to 20,000 units. CSIR-NAL and MAF, Bengaluru, have plans to augment the production capacity to about 30,000 units per day within a period of four weeks.
 Dr Jadhav said that the South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) team worked round the clock for this national cause by accelerating the testing process. The coveralls have gone through stringent testing at SITRA, Coimbatore, and have been qualified for use. (India Science Wire)

California will launch the world's largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana on Monday, as dozens of newly licensed stores catering to adults who enjoy the drug for its psychoactive effects open for business up and down the state.
 It becomes the sixth U.S. state, and by far the most populous, venturing beyond legalized medical marijuana to permit the sale of cannabis products of all types to customers at least 21 years old.
 Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Nevada were the first to introduce recreational pot sales on a state-regulated, licensed and taxed basis. Massachusetts and Maine are on track to follow suit later this year.
 With California and its 39.5 million residents officially joining the pack, more than one-in-five Americans now live in states where recreational marijuana is legal for purchase, even though cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under U.S. law.
 The marijuana market in California alone, which boasts the world's sixth- largest economy, is valued by most experts at several billion dollars annually and is expected to generate at least a $1 billion a year in tax revenue.
 “Adding California to the regulated market for cannabis is a really big deal,” said Heather Azzi, a senior attorney for the Marijuana Policy Project, an advocacy group working to liberalize marijuana laws.
 Uruguay became the first and only country to legalize recreational marijuana sales nationally, permitted through its pharmacies starting in July 2017, but is far smaller in comparison, with a population of just 3.4 million.
 Still, most California jurisdictions are sitting out the highly anticipated New Year's Day inauguration of recreational cannabis sales.
 Many, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, will not be ready for days or weeks because of additional red tape required by city and county governments before would-be retailers can obtain their state licenses.
 But business will almost certainly be brisk at newly permitted shops ready on Day One. They number about four-dozen outlets across California, according to an authoritative guide to the cannabis market, GreenState, published by the San Francisco Chronicle.
 Stores authorised to carry recreational weed were set to go on New Year's Day in San Diego, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Oakland, Berkeley, Eureka and Desert Hot Springs, among other locales. Hundreds more are expected to open throughout the state as the year progresses.
 Many previously operated strictly as medical cannabis dispensaries under a patchwork of local regulations, and will now be licensed by the state for recreational merchandise as well.
 Among the very first will be the Oakland-based Harborside dispensary, which has long ranked as the largest U.S. medical marijuana outlet. It planned to opens its doors at 6 a.m. local time on Monday.
 Customers in the recreational sector - which state regulators prefer to call the “adult use” market - are only permitted to buy an ounce (28 grams) of raw cannabis or its equivalent at a time.
 Medical patients can buy unlimited quantities, but must present a doctor's note and have purchased a medical ID card.
 The stage for Monday's grand opening was set when voters passed a ballot measure in November 2016, Proposition 64, immediately legalizing personal possession and use of recreational pot by adults 21 and over.
 But it has taken California lawmakers and bureaucrats over a year to devise a licensing, regulatory and tax structure for all phases of the commercial distribution chain.
 California in 1996 became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical use, and more than 30 states have since done likewise.
