Lawyers for a group of Brown University athletes whose sports have been targeted for elimination are accusing the Ivy League school of fraud for working secretly on a plan to cut the programs without telling the players their varsity careers were in jeopardy. In a letter to Brown President Christina Paxson, attorney Jeffrey Kessler said the school made a “purposeful choice to conceal critical information\" that cost the athletes the chance to enroll at or transfer to a different school. “It’s very clear that Brown knew at least in January and probably much earlier that it was going to be cutting a significant number of teams, and it deliberately concealed that information from the students and their families,” Kessler told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “By doing so, it betrayed a duty to these athletes and their families. We believe it’s unlawful, and we’re hoping that the university will rethink this and restore the teams.” Brown announced last month that as part of a plan to redirect resources to its more successful programs it would eliminate 11 varsity sports and promote coed and women's sailing to varsity status, bringing the school’s total from 38 teams to 29. The plan would scuttle the men's and women's fencing, golf and squash teams and women’s skiing and equestrian. After a backlash over the disparate effect the cuts would have on minority students, the school backed down and agreed to keep men’s track and cross-country. Unlike the schools that are cutting teams to save money because of the coronavirus pandemic, Brown’s reshuffling of the athletic department has been in the works since 2018. According to the letter, the school completed its review during the 2018-19 academic year and kept it secret from the athletes and their coaches. “They say that this has nothing to do with...

Monona resident Camille Haney, who at the time had an office on the Square that overlooked the statue, decided it was worth saving. She called up Wisconsin's first lady, Sue Ann Thompson, wife to Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, for help.
 The two teamed up to raise nearly $100,000 in less than a year, Haney said, receiving donations across the state, including from the Green Bay Packers.
 The original statue moved into the state Historical Society's headquarters once the replica was placed at the end of State Street, where it has remained for more than two decades until Tuesday evening.

While the Amazons and Walmarts of the world are doing just fine, odds are your favourite restauranteur, retailer, hairdresser, dry-cleaner, tailor, or dress shop owner are not. Close to half of businesses saw revenue drops of over 70% and many had no revenue at all for more than two months during the COVID crisis. Many are still shut.
 "Overwhelming stress" continues to rank high on a long list of worries on our weekly COVID-19 business surveys. This week's survey shows two-thirds are losing sleep over their business' futures.
 As customers, we see the new cleaning protocols and the friendly smiles welcoming us back. But behind the smiles, we know things are very far from normal for our favourite businesses.
 According to new survey data from Maru/Matchbox, close to half of Canadians personally know of a business in their community that has closed permanently due to COVID-19.
 One of the bright spots for many business owners through this crisis had been their connection with customers, many of whom continued to show support as best they could with options like takeout and curbside delivery.
 As businesses reopen, amplifying this support to keep them open is critical. Small businesses don't exist to decorate our communities, they need sales to survive.
 Another emerging bright spot is the parade of initiatives and incentives offered by big businesses, associations, and enterprising individuals across Canada to encourage local shopping.
 To make it easy for consumers to see all the great floats in this parade, we are featuring them on the Small Business Every Day landing page (smallbusinesseveryday.ca). Business owners will also find free downloadable posters and other tools to encourage local shopping.
 Most Canadians want to do more to support local businesses. It's as simple as going for a walk to buy yourself a treat, ordering takeout or recommending a great business by word of mouth or online using #SmallBusinessEveryDay and any of the other great campaign hashtags.
 It's not complicated, but it is critical. Small businesses provide over half of the private sector jobs in Canada, support kids sports teams and make our neighbourhoods fun destinations. Will you help them survive and thrive?

Maintaining that trust is – our should be, at least, an ongoing community endeavor, as police adapt to new realities and residents respond to practices they prefer and ones they object to.
 But communities in Indiana and across the nation today are embarking on massive re-evaluations of police practices and public safety efforts that were prompted not by the evolution of local conditions but by a national outcry over the death of one man at the hands of police in Minnesota.
 That outcry has led people to conclude that the bond between police and public is more fragile than ever. That may be true in some communities more than others; the danger is that all communities will be treated the same both in public opinion and official policy.
 Certainly, there is a nationwide rift in our perception of police, a racial divide we have never gotten a handle on.
 Consider two tableaux, both indelibly imbedded in the public consciousness. Each represents a mother instructing her son in how to handle the police presence in their lives.
 One mother tells her son that the police are his friends. They are the good guys, and he should turn to them if ever he’s in trouble.
 The other tells her son to always be careful in his encounters with police. They don’t need a reason to be suspicious of him except the way he looks.
 Both mothers are right – from their perspective – and trying to deal with the groups the two of them represent tests the endurance of Sir Robert’s wisdom.
 Police are caught between the two groups, one with no trust in the current system at all, the other with an abundance of it. One group keeps shouting that "Black Lives Matter" and that attempts to dilute that message mean the rest of us still aren’t listening. The other group insists that “All Lives Matter” and to behave otherwise will destroy the principle of equality under the law.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Flicking a dismissive jab at President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a plan Wednesday to expand “Obamacare,” even as Trump’s administration is about to file arguments in a Supreme Court case to strike it down.Pelosi announced an upcoming floor vote on her measure, setting up a debate that will juxtapose the Democrats' top policy issue, Trump's unrelenting efforts to dismantle Obama's legacy, and the untamed coronavirus pandemic.On Thursday, the Trump administration is&nbsp;expected to file papers with the Supreme Court&nbsp;arguing that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. Pelosi wants her bill on the House floor Monday.Trying to overturn a health insurance expansion providing coverage to about 20 million people “was wrong any time,” Pelosi said.“Now, it is beyond stupid,” she added. “Beyond stupid.”COVID-19 cases are rising in major states like Texas, Florida and California, and millions of workers who have lost coverage in the economic shutdown to contain the virus can rely on the health law as a backup.The White House said Pelosi is just playing politics. “Instead of diving back into partisan games, Democrats should continue to work with the president on these important issues and ensuring our country emerges from this pandemic stronger than ever,” spokesman Judd Deere said Wednesday in a statement.Pelosi's legislation has no chance in the Republican-controlled Senate.Her bill would expand subsidies, allowing more people to qualify for coverage under the ACA. It would financially squeeze some states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the health law. And it would empower Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices — a position Trump once favored but later abandoned.It would also undo the Trump administration's expansion of short-term insurance plans that don't have to cover preexisting medical conditions, something Democrats say will undermine a central achievement of the ACA.Democrats won control of the House in 2018 on their defense of the health care law. Since then, that chamber has voted on most of the measures in Pelosi's plan in one form or another.But, as underscored in a memo last month led by Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., the broader goal is to make Republicans squirm.“Republicans at all levels own this lawsuit’s attack on Americans’ health care,” said the memo. “They will be held responsible for their party- wide obsession with throwing our health care system into chaos and stripping health care from 20 million Americans during a global pandemic.”Obama’s law has grown more popular since Trump’s unsuccessful effort to repeal it in 2017, when Republicans controlled both the House and Senate. In May, a poll from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that 51% of Americans view “Obamacare” favorably while 41% have unfavorable views.An earlier Kaiser poll found also found that nearly 6 in 10 are worried they or someone in their family will lose coverage if the Supreme Court overturns either the entire law or its protections for people with preexisting medical conditions.In the case before the court, Texas and other conservative-led states argue that the ACA was essentially rendered unconstitutional after Congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the law's unpopular fines for not having health insurance, but left in place its requirement that virtually all Americans have coverage.The conservative states argued that elimination of the fines made the law’s so-called individual mandate unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas agreed, adding that the mandate was so central to the law that without it the rest must also fall.The Trump administration’s views on the law have shifted over time, but it has always supported getting rid of provisions that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people on account of their medical history. Nonetheless, Trump has repeatedly assured Americans that people with preexisting conditions would still be protected. Neither the White House nor congressional Republicans have specified how.A federal appeals court in New Orleans found the health law’s insurance requirement to be unconstitutional, but made no decision on such popular provisions as protections for people with preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion and coverage for young adults up to age 26 on their parents’ policies. It sent the case back to O’Connor to determine whether other parts of the law can be separated from the insurance requirement, and remain in place.Democratic-led states supporting the ACA appealed to the Supreme Court. It's unclear if the court will hear oral arguments before the November election. A decision is unlikely until next year.The court has twice upheld the law, with Chief Justice John Roberts memorably siding with the court’s liberals in 2012, amid Obama’s reelection campaign. The majority that upheld the law twice remains on the court.___Associated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The human domain which civilisation polices so self-importantly is fragile, and is breached by the wild the moment the human race falters.

It's an amazing sound. The field-wide rustle of golden wheat bending in the wind, dry and rasping.
   
 The whole plants sing like they are alive, even as they are, in fact, dying. The stems and leaves of the wheat stalks are waving and whispering; the heads sound both hollow, from the space opened up as the chaff dried, and full, as the kernels are tight and dense.
   
 Even though I didn't grow up actually on a farm, it's a song that strikes a chord deep within me -- the sound of harvest. When I'm standing in a field itself, surrounded by acres of goldening wheat on the cusp of harvest, it becomes one of the richest sounds I've ever heard.
   
 And I don't mean rich as in monetary gain; unfortunately or fortunately, we don't do enough wheat for it to be super helpful in that regard. But that means my perception of this quiet yet strong rustle isn't colored by much other than the thrill and satisfaction of harvest.
   
 And when I say "we"...I do mean "they." As in, Brian and his dad and their coworkers. I literally do nothing with harvest besides shuttle kids and drinks to the field as necessary and available.
   
 Because while I didn't exactly grow up on a farm or in tune with all of the implications of harvest, my uncle farmed crops all along the red-dirt road my family lived down. I got to be one of those kids that clambered up the combine's ladder-steps and settled onto the training seat, when the air was filled with dust, chaff, and excitement. What special memories I have of riding with my uncle, down one pass and back up the next, over and over again. Whether it was cotton or wheat or corn, it was always with some sense of awe that I watched the crops transform from plant to product right in front of my eyes.
   
 So the sounds and vibes of harvesttime get me excited. I have a very naive, happy-go-lucky love of it, because like I said, I don't do any of the work. But it's not hard to feel and share the contagion of harvest thrill in the air.
   
 I also don't have allergies, so harvest air is much better to me than it is to some of you.
   
 I've been considering a lot about how to amplify the harvest party feeling for our farm, especially looking forward to when we can bring kids into the annual celebration. There are not currently a lot of special events attached to the Miller Dairy wheat harvest, so it leaves options wide open for when Prairie Dairy, Brian and I, start doing more. Our wheat only takes a few days, but harvest still feels like a big deal.
   
 Brian didn't get to operate the combine at all last year, since he was recovering from surgery on the couch instead of working in the field. He was ready to get out there this year.
   
 I know some families pack up a festive spread to bring out to the field, picnicking in style. I think this is one of the most lovely, epic ideas I've ever heard (and enjoyed), and I also think it's a lot of work and not the way Brian wants to operate. He just wants a sandwich and a cold drink in the combine, or to eat when he comes home at night to air conditioning.
   
 So what can I do?
   
 Ice cream. I can make ice cream! What's always at a party? What's cold and refreshing? What's a dairy farmer's favorite thing?
   
 It's ice cream. Harvest is now officially a party.
   
 Fresh Lemon Frozen Yogurt
   
 I have a strange dislike of almost all things lemon besides lemon in my water -- and besides this shockingly tasty lemon froyo. It is truly the happiest combo of sweet and tart, rich and refreshing. It is one of Brian's two very most favoritest ice creams; I just asked if he liked this or my browned butter one better, and he seemed offended at the idea of choosing between them (he used phrases like "otherworldly" and "utterly satisfying" to describe them both). We like/LOVE this as is, or with sauced blueberries swirled through.
   
 Prep tips: Homemade yogurt really shines here, since that sour tang complements the lemon, but storebought is also great. We have a frozen-bowl style of ice cream churner, whose only downfall is that it makes small batches. I encourage doubling or even tripling the recipe as your churner allows! This is the slightly condensed version of the recipe I use; let me know if you want the full version.
   
 1 ¼ c whole milk
   
 1 c cream
   
 ¾ c sugar
   
 dash salt
   
 2 lemons
   
 2 T cornstarch
   
 1 c plain greek yogurt
   
 Heat 1 cup milk, cream, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan to a simmer.
   
 Meanwhile, zest lemons with vegetable peeler in large strips; add zest to saucepan. Juice lemons and set juice aside.
   
 Whisk cornstarch with remaining ¼ c milk, then whisk into simmering milk mixture. Cook and stir until it has thickened slightly, then remove from heat and let cool. Thoroughly whisk in yogurt and lemon juice.
   
 Chill completely, then strain out lemon zest pieces. Churn in an ice cream maker.

BOSTON -- A federal court has ruled that T-Mobile can place six cell antennas in the steeple of South Congregational Church in Centerville, potentially ending a two-year controversy that has roiled the village.
 "This did not come as a surprise, given the extremely constrained nature of (Federal Communications Commission) regulations which take precedence over any local municipal control," Charles McLaughlin, assistant town attorney for the town of Barnstable, said Tuesday.
 A large contingent of village residents, banding together as Centerville Concerned Citizens, vehemently opposed the project throughout the permitting process. They packed meetings and hearings at Barnstable Town Hall, voicing concern about potential adverse health effects that could affect the community.
 The telecommunications giant filed the lawsuit against the town and two regulatory boards more than a year ago after being denied approval to install the wireless communications antennas at the Main Street church.
 T-Mobile argued it had a coverage gap in the Centerville and Craigville Beach area, and the church steeple was the only viable location to install equipment to resolve the issue.
 Denials by the town's Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals violated the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and were not supported by substantial evidence, represented effective prohibition of wireless cell service in the area and were unlawful since they were based on concerns about environmental and health effects, T-Mobile said.
 The Telecommunications Act restricts the authority of local and state governments to regulate wireless antenna and tower installation where service is deficient, asserting it amounts to effective prohibition of cell service. It also prohibits local governments from considering environmental effects of radio frequency emissions that comply with FCC regulations.
 The 20-page decision, which was written by U.S. District Judge Denise Casper, was issued June 17. The court ruled the town's denials were not based on substantial evidence and prohibited T-Mobile from providing personal wireless services. The judge rejected T-Mobile's claim that the town's ruling was based on claims regarding the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.
 The town is consulting with an outside attorney who regularly works on FCC- related issues and will make a decision soon regarding a potential appeal of the order, according to McLaughlin.
 The controversy surrounding the antenna installation began in April 2018, after the church entered into an agreement with T-Mobile and received a building permit. The project was halted three months later when the town suspended the permit because the church is located in a Cape Cod Commission- designated district of critical planning concern. The designation prohibits certain development in areas based on factors that include the protection of natural resources, groundwater and buildings of historical significance.
 Centerville Concerned Citizens now has more than 500 followers on its Facebook page.
 Janet Davis, co-chairwoman of the citizens group, says the federal court decision is not a knockout punch, but hopefully just a hurdle that represents the first round of a court battle.
 "We were disappointed at the decision but we understand this is par for the course and these types of issues are not typically resolved at the lower court level," Davis said.
 Centerville Concerned Citizens is urging its members to send emails this week to Barnstable Town Manager Mark Ells requesting the town file an appeal of the decision.
 Davis says the telecommunications legislation is outdated and citizens need to "escape the handcuffs" and reclaim control of their towns to avoid harm from installation of unsafe telecommunications equipment.
 "We've looked the other way for far too long in America and we need to stop," Davis said.
 T-Mobile and South Congregational Church did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

At the ground-level, we need to visibly reinforce our positions, and move forward to the LAC all along, enhancing the operational-tempo of the three services as a measure of deterrence. Indian warships should show heightened presence at the Indian Ocean choke-points. Cyber emergency response teams country-wide should remain on high alert. While building-up stocks of weapons, ammunition and spares, the Ministry of Defence should seize this opportunity to urgently launch some long-term “atma-nirbharta” schemes in defence- production.

"Taking down statues of people who represent values we want to uphold is not the way to go," she said. "These were purely disruptive acts."
 Sinha, who has been outspoken in the need to take down statues of white supremacists, said protesters have a right to be angry over racial injustice. The events in Madison, however, indicated to her that protesters were less focused on any symbolism associated with knocking down a particular statue and more interested in channeling their anger over the arrest of a Black activist onto whatever landmark was found within the vicinity.

“It’s really liminal. It feels like that weird space between two movements,” he said, noting “that is often the feeling of the fishing season anyway. So much anticipation. It’s emotional.”
 Alaska has so far managed to keep its number of COVID-19 cases among the lowest in the nation, helped by its isolation, social-distancing measures and quarantine for arriving travelers. Cruise cancellations, while devastating to the state’s economy, have also shut out 1 million visitors, reducing a potential source of infection.
 In May, as new cases slowed to a trickle, Gov. Mike Dunleavy eased restrictions on bars, restaurants, hairdressers, nail salons, gyms and gatherings. The number of confirmed cases soon began to climb, rising past its previous peak by the second week of June. The state now has more than 859 reported cases.
 One fast-growing source of infection are the nonresidents who arrive every summer to fish and work in seafood processing plants. In a normal year, more than 10,000 of them head to Bristol Bay to bring in and pack most of the wild- caught American salmon that winds up on the country’s dinner plates.
 The seasonal influx always eclipses the year-round population by many thousands. The region has only one small hospital, in the hub of Dillingham, that is not equipped to care for more than a few seriously ill coronavirus patients.
 In recent months, regional public health officials and some local governments and tribes became so concerned about the virus overtaking the hospital that they asked the governor to consider shutting down the fishery. The state instead imposed the 14-day quarantine order and strict health mandates for fishermen and processing companies. Samaritan’s Purse, the evangelical Christian organization that had set up a field hospital in Central Park, flew supplies for a similar hospital to an old military base outside Naknek.
 By mid-June, as the fishing season began, there were more than a dozen cases in the region, almost all of them among people who had come from out of state. As Nicolson packed his patched-up waders and rubber boots in Brooklyn, 900 or so Naknek residents braced for the weeks to come.
 The Fisherman’s Bar sat unusually quiet. In front yards and on boats, small yellow-and-black flags began to appear, signaling that whoever lived there had arrived from somewhere else and was under quarantine.
 “There’s still a bit of socialization here and there that I see in the boatyard, but it’s nothing like what it was,” said Nels Ure, a fisherman. “It almost feels a little ominous.”
 The work of fishing is sleepless and bone-tiring. Operators net the fish from boats, or, like Nicolson, they string nets into the current from the shore, which is called set-netting. The salmon hit hard for a few peak weeks. Fishermen work around the clock, following a state-managed schedule of openings and closings dictated by the tides.
 Once nets are full, fishermen must shake or untangle each fish from the net. Even without the virus, a host of things can go wrong: broken motors, tangled gear, bad weather, injuries, problems with a crew.

FORT WAYNE - “To recognise always that the power of the police to fulfill their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour, and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect.” – From the nine principles set out in Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel’s General Instructions issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police of the Greater London area, starting in 1829
 PEEL'S DIRECTIVE to win the public’s approval was No. 2 on his list, right after the duty of police to “prevent crime and disorder” and right before securing the willingness of the public in the “observance of laws.”
 That’s the whole concept of policing in a nutshell. Public safety is possible only if the public trusts that laws are just and police are fair in enforcing them.

The Ringside News portal reports that the way creative ideas are launched has changed considerably. Ed Koskey "is the one who launches the ideas now." Bruce Prichard is there, but he is said to be there "to tell Vince good jokes." Ryan Ward is there to "laugh at Bruce Prichard's jokes" and come up with a "Plan B" in case an idea "Vince doesn't like."

“I started training for an Ironman (triathlon) again,” said Riley, who lives in Gainesville.
 But his running pace was way off. He felt anxious and was having trouble sleeping. His blood pressure was unusually high. And, all of a sudden, he depended on reading glasses. Even so, he dismissed the symptoms as part of life or the aging process. Maybe, he thought to himself, he just needed to train harder.
 But his physician, Dr. Reisman, knew better. Reisman kept in close touch with Riley, monitoring his vitals and overall health. Riley’s blood pressure, usually about 125 over 60, was around 180 over 100.
 Riley didn’t need to go the hospital, but Reisman knew his patient was not over the coronavirus.
 For COVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to be hospitalized, there is no specific drug or treatment, other than rest, fluids and fever-reducing medicine, such as Tylenol. Primary doctors monitor for red flags, such as trouble breathing, which would trigger an ER visit.
 Reisman knew about a post-COVID trial for survivors of mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Riley enrolled in the clinical trial for leronlimab, a drug that was originally developed to treat HIV, but is showing promise in the coronavirus fight. He had four injections in his stomach over two weeks.
 Riley said he immediately felt better. He returned to a faster pace, his blood pressure returned to normal and the other symptoms – the anxiety, the insomnia — faded.
 It’s possible he was given a placebo or perhaps it was time that helped him heal, but Riley is confident that it was the leronlimab.
 Doctor who was also COVID-19 patient
 Dr. Chris Recknor, a Gainesville internist who runs one of the six sites for the leronlimab clinical trial, is also a COVID-19 survivor.
 He first got sick in April, starting with an intense headache. Then, he started bumping into things and saw floaters in his eyes. Those aren’t the most common coronavirus symptoms, but he knew something wasn’t right and decided to get tested to, if nothing else, rule out the infectious virus. The test was positive.
 His conditioned worsened to the point where he thought he might have a heart attack. He ended up in ER at Northeast Georgia Medical Center three times and was twice admitted for overnight stays.
 “I felt like my heart was pumping so hard, it felt like it was coming out of my ears,” he said.
 His physician at the hospital obtained “compassionate use” permission from the Food and Drug Administration to prescribe leronlimab.
 Researchers think that the drug may work by calming the aggressive immune response called the “cytokine storm,” which occurs in ill COVID-19 patients.
 Recknor said he felt better within two days after getting the medication and has fully recovered.
 “The only way I can explain it is, it was like it felt like I had 1,000 cups of coffee,” said Recknor. “And then after the medicine, it was like a relaxing time on the beach. A couple days after the medicine, I was back to doing everything normal. I knew there were other people like me having crazy symptoms.”
 So Recknor, who is a clinical trialist and founder of the Center for Advanced Research & Education, contacted the drug company and offered to run one of the country’s clinical trial sites. Those in the trial are post-COVID survivors looking for relief after several weeks of battling the illness.
 Results from the Phase II clinical trial are expected in July.

We all realise that the use of technology in education has gained more traction and salience during the pandemic. There is no doubt that education technology and digital resources have been put to vigorous use to keep the teaching-learning process on. Some may be led to believe that technology can even replace brick-and-mortar classrooms. But that does not seem to be the case. The stress among students learning in virtual mode during the pandemic has been a matter of concern. Such stress may also partly be due to the overall changed circumstances caused by the disease. But shifting completely to the virtual learning has also curtailed some of the essential features of a wholesome pedagogy, and seems to have contributed to the stress among children. Sooner or later, the collective human will to survive shall prevail and the pestilence will be defeated. Then, we will shift to a blended mode of learning, in which actual classroom and technology will work in tandem.

Unlike the schools that are cutting teams to save money because of the coronavirus pandemic, Brown's reshuffling of the athletic department has been in the works since 2018. According to the letter, the school completed its review during the 2018-19 academic year and kept it secret from the athletes and their coaches.

 "This allowed the musicians to be paid," said Rick. "We did some take-out sales but it was really done more so the musicians could perform and we could stay relevant."
 The last online concert series will take place this Saturday when Dave Murphy Band takes the stage at 7 p.m.
 The pub will be empty, but the patio will have a few tables near a door overlooking the stage and everybody will be able to hear. Some can bring up the live-streamed event on their phones and watch it on their device.
 "It will be fun," said Rick.
 While the mood is positive, the reality is still problematic for Mulligan's -- or any establishment.
