The Eugene City Council passed a motion directing the city manager to implement a revised Community Safety Initiative engagement process during its virtual work session Monday that took place over Zoom.
 The city council passed the engagement plan by a 7-1 vote, with only Councilor Betty Taylor voting in opposition.
 The city council passed the Community Safety Payroll Tax Ordinance in June 2019 “to provide long-term funding for community safety services,” according to the city’s website. Some of the funding will go to the initiative passed on Monday night.

 Dear Dave,
 I've been trying to get my sister and her husband on your plan, but they're hesitant to try living on a budget. They make good money, and both of them think doing a budget every month would be too difficult and take too much time. Do you have any suggestions I could pass along that might make them realize that making a budget isn't so hard or time-consuming?
  _Kelsey_
 Dear Kelsey,
 Believe me, I hear those excuses all the time. In most cases, the people who say these kinds of things don't really understand what a budget is or how to efficiently put one together. If you've followed my advice, you learned first- hand that budgeting isn't scary once you get the hang of it. Household budgets don't need to be about hours of tedious math and complicated formulas. Like most things in life, simple is usually best.
 A good way to simplify budgeting, especially for couples, is by making it a team effort. It's important to make sure your spouse is on board, and knows what's up with the budget, because you're just asking for problems when one spouse is doing all the planning and the other is doing all the spending.
 Sit down together for a few minutes, once a month, and have a budget meeting where you look at your income, your outgo, and you both give every dollar a name and a job to do. It's really that simple. Share your ideas, your hopes, and your dreams for the future, as well as the fears you have. The important thing is that you're both in agreement and working together. That alone will make your lives, your budget, and your money easier to handle.
 Also, make sure you have cut up all your credit cards and closed the accounts. No more credit cards means fewer bills to add to the budget, fewer complications, and zero worries about fees and interest rates. Stick to using a debit card and cash. After all, they're both part of the plan!
 Making a schedule for budget meetings and bill payments is a good idea, too. You can even make your budget meetings a fun time by including your favorite snacks. Set up auto drafts out of your checking account to pay bills and buy your groceries on a set day every week or twice a month. When you know what to expect and when, it takes a lot of stress and potential pitfalls out of the budgeting picture.
 There's always some work and discipline that goes along with gaining control of your money. But a budget doesn't need to be torture. A little planning, communication and some basic math will go a long way - and it won't be nearly as time-consuming, or as difficult, as you think!

Round 12 of the FIA Formula One World Championship brings us to a track hosting its very first Grand Prix this weekend, the Autodromo Internacional do Algarve. Whilst the undulating circuit has never held a Formula One race before, it is not completely unfamiliar to the F1 fraternity as it was used for pre-season testing in the winters of 2008 and 2009. The 4.6km track has an elevation change baked into its layout that sends drivers swooping up and down hill, before culminating in a plunging run to the final right-hander at Galp leading back onto the pit straight. Whilst the majority of drivers are yet to experience the Portuguese circuit, both George Russell and Nicholas Latifi are fortunate to have driven there in previous years.

“It’s always exciting when you get a bid like this and get to have Emporia State and our community to be seen on the national scale,” said ESU Athletic Director Kent Weiser during a Monday morning media conference. “I don’t think it could have come at a better time as we all need something good to look forward to during this time of the pandemic.”
 ESU has previously hosted the event on three occasions, all under the leadership of 11-time MIAA Coach of the Year David Harris, in 1995, 1999 and 2006. In the near future, Welch Stadium and Zola Witten Track will be home to a national championship twice more in a development that will provide a boost both to the university and Emporia.
 In the midst of a year that has taken so much from Emporia, its university and the athletic department it so prides itself on, ESU has delivered a reason to look to the future.
 “I like to live in the now and the present, but you’ve got to look forward to 2024 quite a bit right now,” said Head Track and Field Coach Steve Blocker. “We’re pretty pumped and I’m ready to go.”
 The process of bringing a national championship back to ESU’s campus began a year and a half ago in conversations between Blocker and Weiser. Once their plan became solidified, through meetings with university officials such as President Allison Garrett and city officials, the work of executing the bid commenced.
 In securing the selection, Blocker’s status within the world collegiate track and field turned out to be a difference maker.
 First starting as an assistant at ESU in 2009, the ninth-year head coach has long been involved in committees and organizations at the national level, building relationships throughout the world of track and field and the NCAA along the way. The relationships Blocker has fostered, recent renovations to Welch Stadium and the school’s track and field facilities, and plenty of bureaucratic legwork were all a part of what culminated to ESU’s selection by the NCAA.
 “It means a lot to me, personally,” Blocker said. This is something that will highlight our program.”

COVID-19 restrictions have led to a mostly remote fall term, with some in- person labs, studio experiences and other small classes. Students living in the residence halls go through a testing process before and after move-in to ensure that the spread of the virus is minimized. But while students who live on and off campus have the opportunity to get tested at the University Health Center, that option does not exist for faculty and employees who are required to teach on campus every day for their job.
 Sam Stroich, assistant director of the Oregon Outdoor Program, said he is mostly concerned about the lack of mandatory testing for the non-student staff he works with on a daily basis.
 “So many of my coworkers are amazing and super respectful and concerned about the community, but there are several people on campus who are not,” Stroich said. “It might be a political basis or something, but there is definitely a lack of consistency around mask-wearing. For me, no matter how you feel about the mask piece, it’s a commitment to our community and to respecting others.”

 David Warner is the only overseas player with more than 5000 IPL runs.
 Dhawan laid into the KXIP bowling attack from the word go, getting to his half-century off just 28 balls.
 This knock is the fourth successive fifty-plus score for the left-hander. He returned 101, 57 and 69 not out in his last three innings.
 Dhawan remained unbeaten on 106 against KXIP and helped Delhi post 164 on the board.
 Overall, Dhawan has 5044 IPL runs at 35.02 and a strike rate of 126.70 with two centuries and 39 half-centuries.

One need look no further than 2018 to see how a rural-urban divide works when Laura Kelly won the gubernatorial race. She garnered a majority of votes in just six counties and a plurality in three others.
 More than 40 percent of registered voters didn’t pull a lever in that election. Boosting turnout just a percentage point or two in the 96 other counties would have easily changed the results of the election. Small shifts would have made a big difference.
 The same is going to be true on Nov. 4. It will be easy to look back at who voted, and who didn’t, and identify races that could have gone differently.
 Voting is the first step, but there’s more farmers and ranchers can do to amplify their voices, like boosting turnout. Make those personal phone calls, have those in-person conversations and post to social media. Talk with your friends and neighbors. Talk with your cousins in Kansas City or landlord in Wichita. Talk with anyone else who shares your values and make sure they’ll cast a ballot this year.
 Like every other election, this one will come down to turnout. Be sure you’re included in the outcome. Your voice and your values are on the ballot.

Other communities have fared better, but are still dealing with the virus. Willcox, zip code 85643, was reporting between six and 10 cases as of Friday and Benson has between one and five cases.
 What’s happening in Cochise County is also happening in Arizona and across the country. The number of weekly cases increased by 23 percent to 4,764 from the week ending Oct. 3 to the week ending Oct. 10, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS). On Saturday the ADHS reported 921 new cases statewide, bringing the daily average up from 480 new cases per day on Oct. 1 to 764 new cases per day last week.
 Nationwide, The New York Times reports the daily average of new COVID-19 cases in the United States topped 54,000, last week a 25 percent increase from the average at the beginning of October.
 Despite this “slow boil” increase, local officials appear less concern about the virus now than they did when Arizona was approaching its pandemic peak in June. Sierra Vista Mayor Rick Mueller suspended his city’s mask order Sept. 18, when the county’s active case count was at 26.
 Douglas has moved in the same direction. Last week the city council debated whether to continue the mask mandate it established shortly after Gov. Ducey signed an executive order June 17 that authorized local governments to require facial coverings.
 An absence of face masks has also been evident in Benson, Willcox and Tombstone are recent community events. Facial coverings were few and far between at the Butterfield Rodeo, Rex Allen Days and at Helldorado Days.
 A recent study by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) showed that COVID-19 cases in Arizona spiked 151 percent after a statewide stay-at-home order expired and dropped 75 percent following local mask mandates in July.
 Cochise County experienced that decline, with case numbers falling off dramatically in August and September.
 Now the numbers appear to be climbing again and it’s time for local officials to reconsider embracing and emphasizing the protocols that contributed to a decline in cases in August and September.
 Let’s stop this surge, before it gets any worse.

Elizabeth Clinton (Kitty) Roberts, 78, of Emporia left this earth peacefully to be with her Heavenly Father Friday morning, October 16, 2020.
 She was born on August 12, 1942, in Jasper County, SC to Joseph Randolph and Mary Elizabeth Carter. She was a member of Grace United Methodist Church where she served as church secretary until her retirement in September 2013. She was HR director at Holiday Resort but most people came to know Kitty as the friendly Assistant Manager of Bluestem Bowl. It was while working here she met the love of her life, John. Prior to moving to Emporia in 1972 Kitty was a professional seamstress and spent many years as the floor manager for a coat factory in California.
 In addition to working full time and raising her children Kitty spent her entire life volunteering. She served as a youth group director, Little League coach, girls softball coach, PTA volunteer and Girl Scout Leader. After moving to Kansas, she continued her work in Girl Scouting as a troop leader, camp director and major event chairman. In 1994 she was the recipient of the Flint Hills Girl Scout Council Family Award. In later years she became an active member of the UMW organizing and leading events such as the Angel Food Ministry Team.
 Kitty was a determined and independent woman who loved her family fiercely. Before health problems began limiting her Kitty loved to hunt, fish, camp and travel with John especially to their favorite spot on Truman Lake. They shared a passion for good food, knowledge, NASCAR, the Kansas City Royals and the Chiefs. She loved baking, gardening and reading. Kitty was an extraordinary seamstress who could create anything. She had requests for her unique themed Santa’s across the country. She continued to sew until the time of her death making over 1800 Covid masks for a local doctors office.

“I love the adventure,” she said. “I love the freedom of two wheels. You see things, smell things, hear things that you don’t when you’re in a car. I’m more at one with nature.”
 Riding gravel and motorcycles also comes with a strong sense of camaraderie and community; meeting and getting to know fellow riders on a regular basis. That is where Siebenaler’s hobbies and career intersect.
 After 14 years at Norfolk, Siebenaler again decided to take a different path and became the Sales Manager for the Emporia Convention and Visitors Bureau. There, she helped sell Emporia as the place to be for meetings, conferences and other events.
 “I love Emporia,” she said. “I can’t imagine living anywhere else.”
 The COVID-19 pandemic, however, slammed the brakes on the market for corporate events. Siebenaler used the opportunity to get back to her roots, in a sense, by becoming a Sales Consultant at Clint Bowyer Autoplex.
 No matter where she stopped, however, the aspect of working in sales she has enjoyed the most has been the people who have been along for the ride.
 “I love the customer relationship side of it,” Siebenaler said. “I love getting to meet people and getting to know people. Clint Bowyer Autoplex gives me the opportunity to do that every day.
 “The most rewarding thing about it is when you do your job correctly and get that customer satisfaction. It’s a job that’s all about making people happy. It’s challenging sometimes, but it’s very rewarding.”
 Siebenaler said she has been afforded many opportunities — professional and personal — living in Emporia. She said it was a “wonderful place to build a career” and that she is grateful for the community support she has received along with the positive examples in her life from local women such as her mother, who is also a long-time businesswoman in Emporia.
 “I love working with members of our community,” she said. “I love my job. I love getting up for work every day.”

On April 1, the Russian military transport aircraft An-124 Ruslan delivered humanitarian aid to the United States. On board the aircraft were disinfectants, goggles, respirators and masks, as well as equipment. The State Department said that they paid for the deliveries from Russia in full, Moscow denied this, pointing out that half of the cargo was paid by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the same - by the American side.

While he pointed to the Student Sustainability Center’s work as hugely important, Boyd said “relying on only one organization to do all of this coverage isn’t fair in terms of their capacity and also for students in general.”
 Boyd thinks that ASUO can do more to make food security initiatives more equitable. “There’s a lot of other areas that we could provide more specifically to,” he said. “Minority or BIPOC communities that might have even a harder time in terms of accessibility need to have special coverage. We need to be able to be providing, saying we have these programs that exist for them.”
 For Boyd, this means reaching out to student groups around campus and figuring out who of the UO student body is in need. “Those that don’t have the resources, we give them a little extra,” he said, “so that they’re able to maintain their way through college.”
 One idea he has is to build a food pantry in the EMU. Following the produce drop outside the EMU amphitheater, the food security task force could move remaining food to a walk in fridge where students could access it throughout the week if needed. Boyd is drawn to this idea due to the EMU’s central location on campus, which means that students wouldn’t have to travel far to obtain fresh produce.
 “The heart of it,” he said, “is trying to make things more accessible, listening to the experts, trying to connect with students and hear their needs. But the biggest power that I think ASUO has is to serve as an amplifier for student voices and then seeing where we can provide financial support and leading initiatives.”
 Even without the Street Faire revenue, ASUO is in a place where it can provide monetary support to a number of programs on campus. Unlike most years, it currently has a $1.3 million surplus, and Boyd calculated that it will see a comparable figure next year. “We’re in a really great position,” he said, “where we have substantial funding that we could use to kickstart a lot of these programs, that we can use to immediately respond to food insecurity needs.”
 Boyd said he hopes that ASUO’s legislative and executive branches can work together in the distribution of this money, and that he sees the senate’s food security committee as an avenue through which to pursue this.
 Beyond ASUO’s finances, Langford has other plans in the works. He’s in the process of creating a grant which those in the UO community can use to launch additional food security initiatives — so long as a student is on the proposed team.
 “It will be an opportunity to assist students who may need it,” he said, “but also that will hopefully be a mechanism for folks around the institution — faculty, staff and students — to participate in supporting students in a real, tangible and concrete way.”
 Langford said he hopes to get the application forms out by the end of October. In the meantime, there’s plenty of existing services for students, and the food security task force is working hard to get the word out.
 According to McHolm, all of the existing programs have the capacity to serve a larger population than they currently are. “If we saw more students at the pantry or we saw more students at produce drop or we saw more students at SNAP, we have the resources available to meet that need, whatever it is,” he said. “We really just are trying to get as many students to come and access them as is necessary.”
 The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is a particular focus in the midst of a pandemic. Since it exists across the country, it’s accessible for students who aren’t in Eugene.
 “The thing that we constantly want to underscore to folks is that decisions to skip a meal or decisions to spend money on books instead of food, none of those decisions are okay with us,” McHolm said. “We really want to make sure that students know that these resources exist and have access to them.”

Movies about stand-up comics haven't exactly flooded the market or even become known as a genre, but they do pop up now and then. Joaquin Phoenix played a guy who wanted to be one in "Joker." Adam Sandler took Seth Rogen under his wing to make him a better one in "Funny People." Tom Hanks and Sally Field were both looking for the big break on the stand-up stage in "Punchline."      The newest entry is a sweet, simple, low-budget film called "The Opening Act" that's about a young man named Will (Jimmy O. Yang) whose goal in life is to get up in front of crowds and make them laugh.      A sequence at the top previews some nicely streamlined storytelling from writer-director - Stephen Byrne - himself a comic and actor - with a lot going on that doesn't rely on dialogue. There's Will, as a young boy, and his father, laughing together, watching stand-up acts on TV. Their living room setting stays the same, but the film keeps jumping forward in time as they continue watching and laughing (with the boy played by different actors) at the TV over the years. That part poignantly ends with adult Will (Yang) on the couch, still watching, but now alone, not laughing, his father obviously gone.      But his dream of doing what he's been watching is very much alive. The odds are against him. He's well aware that not many people make it in this profession. But when he's not at his day job, sitting in a cubicle, dealing with auto insurance claims for a demanding boss (Bill Burr), he's trying out material at open mic nights. He does get laughs from his audience, but he's only gone as far as a bar & grill in Steubenville, Ohio.      The first step of that dream would be to perform at his first real club. A piece of luck comes his way when more-experienced fellow open mic comic Quinn (Ken Jeong) can't do an out-of-town emcee gig at an improv club, and offers the spot to Will.      There's not a great deal of plotting to deal with here, which makes the film a little loose and more fun to watch. It quickly turns into a slice-of-stand-up comic-life story in which you can just sit back and keep track of Will's triumphs and travails and wonder if he'll beat those odds.      The club, over the border in Pennsylvania, is run by stern and seemingly humorless Chip (Neal Brennan), who reads a low key riot act to novice Will the moment he says hello. Chip's suggestion to Will is that he'd better be funny. The gig incorporates a 12-minute routine as an opener, introducing feature act Chris (Alex Moffat from "SNL"), then introducing headliner Billy G (Cedric "The Entertainer").      Well, Chris is a great comic, but an out-of-control drinker, womanizer, and party guy. Billy G is a star comedian (though Chris considers him to be over the hill) who's kind of an unfriendly cuss to Will, especially when Will screws up his intro.      It's a three-night gig, and the film focuses on the differences between each one of them. Will is understandably nervous, he does well, he has to deal with his first-ever hecklers, he doesn't do well, his loyalty to his loving girlfriend back home is challenged, he wonders if maybe the comedy life "isn't in the cards for me."      Yang gives an amiable, enthusiastic performance, and you do wonder if his Will is just too much of a nice guy to be in this cutthroat business. Jeong, even with limited time here, shows a bit of his wild and crazy side at the microphone. Moffat is terrific at presenting a character who may or may not be out of control. But it's Cedric's scenes - first when his character is unapproachable and later as he offers Will some sage advice about the business - who contributes the finest acting.      The film has a definite charm to it, along with some very funny bits. But it also serves as a cautionary tale. It says, unflinchingly, that making people laugh, even getting the opportunity to try to make people laugh, is not easy.      "The Opening Act" is playing in theaters and is available digitally and On Demand.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

“After that, we go straight to Imola. In June we had a filming day with the team there, and even if it was possible to do only a few laps, I enjoyed running around the track a lot. It’s an old-school track, one of those I really like, with gravel traps, high-speed and blind corners and elevation changes. It’s not going to be easy to set up the car properly for Qualifying and the race with only one Free practice, but it’s a nice challenge which makes the weekend very exciting. Actually, we have tested this format at the Nürburgring when both Friday sessions were cancelled, and I have to say we managed to do everything we needed and the race was a really good one. Hopefully, it will be the same in Imola where the temperatures might be quite cold like in Germany. Last but not least, it’s another home Grand Prix, the closest one to the team’s HQ – only around 20 km away. It’s a pity that, because of the Covid situation, people are not allowed in the paddock, otherwise it could have been a great opportunity for all the Scuderia AlphaTauri employees to visit the garage in organized slots and see live on site what they all work for. I’ll try to do all I can to deliver the best possible performance like always, good points in Imola would be a big thank you to them all.”

Dear Dave,
 I've been trying to get my sister and her husband on your plan, but they're hesitant to try living on a budget. They make good money, and both of them think doing a budget every month would be too difficult and take too much time. Do you have any suggestions I could pass along that might make them realize that making a budget isn't so hard or time-consuming?
 Kelsey
 Dear Kelsey,
 Believe me, I hear those excuses all the time. In most cases, the people who say these kinds of things don't really understand what a budget is or how to efficiently put one together. If you've followed my advice, you learned first- hand that budgeting isn't scary once you get the hang of it. Household budgets don't need to be about hours of tedious math and complicated formulas. Like most things in life, simple is usually best.
 A good way to simplify budgeting, especially for couples, is by making it a team effort. It's important to make sure your spouse is on board, and knows what's up with the budget, because you're just asking for problems when one spouse is doing all the planning and the other is doing all the spending.
 Sit down together for a few minutes, once a month, and have a budget meeting where you look at your income, your outgo, and you both give every dollar a name and a job to do. It's really that simple. Share your ideas, your hopes, and your dreams for the future, as well as the fears you have. The important thing is that you're both in agreement and working together. That alone will make your lives, your budget, and your money easier to handle.
 Also, make sure you have cut up all your credit cards and closed the accounts. No more credit cards means fewer bills to add to the budget, fewer complications, and zero worries about fees and interest rates. Stick to using a debit card and cash. After all, they're both part of the plan!
 Making a schedule for budget meetings and bill payments is a good idea, too. You can even make your budget meetings a fun time by including your favorite snacks. Set up auto drafts out of your checking account to pay bills and buy your groceries on a set day every week or twice a month. When you know what to expect and when, it takes a lot of stress and potential pitfalls out of the budgeting picture.
 There's always some work and discipline that goes along with gaining control of your money. But a budget doesn't need to be torture. A little planning, communication and some basic math will go a long way - and it won't be nearly as time-consuming, or as difficult, as you think!

Around two years ago, drone maker DJI released a tiny stabilized 4K videocam called the Osmo Pocket. Now the company has announced a much-improved second generation model called the Pocket 2.
 "There was nothing like the DJI Osmo Pocket on the market when we first released it in November 2018, and it immediately changed the way we capture life’s special moments," said Roger Luo, DJI's President. "DJI Pocket 2 takes it even further. We listened to our customers’ feedback and adapted the iconic design and form factor while raising the bar for the camera system. Pocket 2 brings an improved audio experience, as well as wider expandability.
 "Whether you are out and about capturing everyday stories or a vlogger who requires more creative flair, the built-in intelligent features and different video templates allow anyone to create cinematic and engaging content. Everyone and anyone can shoot a video, but Pocket 2 can help you capture footage like a pro, taking your visual storytelling skills to a whole new level."
 On the outside, the tiny hand-held camera looks very similar to the original Osmo Pocket, and can be used as a stand-alone vlogger tool, hooked up to a smartphone or operated wirelessly. The interface and features of the Mimo mobile app have been streamlined, and as well as a built-in editing tool, there's now a new AI Editor that can select highlights from footage and create a short video mashup.
