Like the room, the bathroom was very small and could only fit one person at a time. To maximize space, the vanity area was situated directly over both the toilet and the sink, so there was not a lot of space to get ready. Just outside of the bathroom, a large, full-length mirror gave me something better to work with.
 The bathroom decor was basic with white walls, green-tile accents, beige floors, and a simple shower with a glass door. While none of that was impressive, the water pressure was great and there were custom Aveda bath products with a ginger-citrus scent I loved that made for a spa-like shower in a very non-spa setting.
 Travelers who are light sleepers should be warned: the walls are thin and I heard a lot of walking, doors opening and closing, furniture moving, and creaking. Had I been staying in a room that looked over Collins Avenue, I can only assume street noise would have been just as apparent. Overall, I found the noise to be manageable and it did not interrupt my sleep. However, if that's a deal breaker, request a room on a higher floor (in the back of the hotel), or perhaps consider another property entirely.
 At the end of the day, I thought my tropical room was charming, fun, and comfortable, even with little space. It's a good choice for a clean, cheap, stylish place to sleep in a prime Miami Beach location, but don't expect luxury amenities. Next time, I'll book a Standard King Bed for the extra space, which would surprisingly reduce the nightly rate by $50.

El artículo 3 del Reglamento Sanitario establece que su aplicación se hará con respeto pleno de la dignidad, los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de las personas. Este deber es un reflejo del compromiso de las sociedades democráticas con la igualdad moral y política de todos los seres humanos. Ante una emergencia de salud pública, los estados deben tratar con igual consideración y respeto a todas las personas, que tienen igual dignidad.
 Además de hacer campañas informativas y de concientización, los gobiernos deben combatir la propagación de información falsa, que puede crear confusión pública y generar intolerancia, discriminación y xenofobia. Por ello, las medidas no pueden estar basadas en meros prejuicios con las personas que provengan de países donde se haya propagado el Covid19, que puede causar estigmatización y resultar en violaciones de derechos humanos.
 Al mismo tiempo, los gobiernos no deben ocultar información y deben ser respetuosos de la libertad de expresión y de prensa. En las sociedades en las que el gobierno no puede solucionar un problema encerrando personas arbitrariamente, las medidas de salud pública funcionan cuando hay confianza pública en las decisiones del gobierno. La transparencia es fundamental, así como también la libertad para pedir explicaciones al gobierno por sus medidas.
 Finalmente, como establece el artículo 43 del Reglamento, las medidas que tomen los estados deben estar basadas en evidencia científica y deben ser proporcionales a los riesgos involucrados. Por supuesto, el derecho constitucional de cada país permite, en circunstancias excepcionales, restringir derechos individuales cuando un país enfrenta una emergencia de salud pública o por razones de salud pública. Sin embargo, no todas las restricciones son aceptables. Éstas deben ser excepcionales y proporcionales a los fines de salud pública que se quieran promover. Por ello, muchos autores han puesto en duda las medidas de cuarentena masivas que, sin evidencia abundante en su favor, conllevan violaciones innecesarias a la libertad de movimiento y a la privacidad de las personas.
 Estas medidas pueden generar un excesivo miedo en la población, pueden causar aislamiento y poner en peligro la vida comunitaria. En cambio, para evitar la arbitrariedad en el uso de la coerción, es aceptable el uso de protocolos para detectar casos sospechosos, siempre que se implemente de modo tal que sea compatible con el respeto a la dignidad, los derechos humanos y las garantías fundamentales de las personas.

The primary focus for both the New England Revolution and Chicago Fire FC this weekend will be to rebound from the rough season-opening defeat that each team suffered.
 In the process, the Revolution will aim to continue their recent home success over the Fire on Saturday at Foxborough, Mass.
 What started out positive for both New England and Chicago last weekend turned into disappointment for these clubs in the kickoff to the 2020 season. Each side held a lead in its opener, but ended up with a 2-1 loss on the road.
 The Revolution led 1-0 on a goal in the 13th minute from Teal Bunbury. The Montreal Impact, however, equalized the score shortly before halftime and went ahead for good in the 80th minute on a goal by Maximiliano Urruti. It marked the seventh straight season that New England failed to win its opener.
 The good news, though, is that the Revolution get the chance to bounce back with a game at home, where they went 6-1-4 after losing four of their first six in 2019.
 "It's an important game," midfielder Wilfried Zahibo told the Revolution's official website. "It is important we start (well) at home. We want a good start, we want the fans to be happy, and we want the three points."
 New England is 17-11-3 all-time against the Fire at home. Zahibo scored and Gustavo Bou posted the 86th-minute winner in a 2-1 home win over the Fire last season.
 Chicago led 1-0 early in the second half at Seattle last weekend, courtesy of a Robert Beric goal. After the reigning MLS Cup champion Sounders leveled the match in the 62nd minute, it still looked as if the Fire would earn a well- deserved point until Jordan Morris won the game with a stoppage-time goal.
 "We are a good team, we have to believe in this," Beric told the Fire's official website. "I think we showed (at Seattle) to everyone that it's going to be tough to play against us.
 "(Last weekend) we lost, but hopefully in the future things will turn around and be better for us."
 While New England is again expected to be minus injured playmaker Carles Gil (foot), it's also uncertain if Chicago forward C.J. Sapong (chest) will be available.

The British government has called a meeting with sports governing bodies and broadcasters on Monday to discuss how they would cope with a broader outbreak of coronavirus, two people familiar with the situation said.The department in charge of sport will meet with sporting officials to discuss all outcomes including the possibility that some events could be held behind closed doors, one source said. The department declined to comment. A third person said they have been in regular dialogue with the government for some time.Britains four-phase plan for dealing with the virus is currently in its initial containment stage but preparations for the next phase - known as delay - are advanced. A planning document published earlier this week said that in the delay phase government would consider taking action to reduce the number of large scale gatherings to help slow the spread of the disease throughout the population.One person has died in Britain from the virus so far and more than 160 people have tested positive. Italy has ordered all major sporting events throughout the country, including top-flight Serie A soccer games, to be played without fans for one month in a bid to curb Europes worst coronavirus outbreak.In England, the top-tier soccer Premier League is two thirds of the way through the season and is due to end in May.

Guatemalas new government is trying to limit the number of foreign migrants the United States sends its way under an agreement that makes the Central American nation a buffer zone to reduce U.S. asylum claims.The United States has sent hundreds of Honduran and El Salvadoran asylum seekers to Guatemala under the agreement implemented in November and is now seeking to expand the program. However, Guatemalas priority in ongoing talks with U.S. officials is to make sure the number sent back daily does not exceed its very limited capacity to process new arrivals, deputy foreign minister Eduardo Hernandez told Reuters.We have only one runway and one migrant reception center, Hernandez said in an interview last week. The agreement cannot exceed our installed capacity. As it stands, the deal is one of a series of overlapping measures the Trump administration sees as key to bringing down irregular migration into the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump has made his performance on controlling immigration a plank of his 2020 re- election campaign.Known as an Asylum Cooperative Agreement and signed by the previous Guatemalan government, the deal is similar to the safe third country agreement under which asylum seekers who pass through Canada must apply for refuge there rather than in the United States. Critics of the arrangement, and similar U.S. deals with Honduras and El Salvador, say those countries do not offer adequate conditions for protecting at-risk migrants and that their asylum systems are too rudimentary to cope.Under President Alejandro Giammattei, who took office in January, the Guatemalan government has promised to give more information about the deal, which was negotiated behind closed doors and was only partially made public. Hernandez said the government was working with U.S. counterparts to produce clear implementation rules governing issues such as how many families with children Guatemala accepts, whether to extend the deal to more nationalities, and how many foreign asylum seekers it would take per day. If it is possible, we want to add an annex, something succinct, simple, direct, clear and that leaves no space for interpretation, he told Reuters last week.Under the initial agreement, the United States agreed to only include individual adults, but Hernandez said it was later extended to include families with children. Casa de Migrante, a non- governmental shelter that receives the returned foreign migrants, say pregnant women and young children showing signs of chronic stress were among the people U.S. officials had placed in the program.Data released by the Guatemalan Immigration Institute, a government agency, show that through March 3 a total of 789 people have been returned, including 311 children.

Please welcome the author of "Rocco's keto comfort food diet," Rocco Dispirito. Wow, what an intro. Thank you so much. I know. Welcome. Makes a great fan, joy, by the way, you want to fan away those alcohol fumes. It works. You feel that? I don't drink. I was talking about the gel. I got to tell you this keto thing is beyond a trend. I'm so excited that most people know what I'm talking I usually come on with books and crazy theories that no one understands and I'm trying to get you guys to believe in it. You're kind of like, yeah, okay, we still love you but. Everyone knows what keto is. Three years ago when we conceived the book we weren't sure that would be the case. What I love about you though, we're low carb in our house because I met my husband and thought it was a big red flag on our first date where he said he didn't eat bread. No more, thank you. Slowly I've learned a lot of the science and nutrition behind it but not a lot of chefs have addressed it. We have people creating recipes which are nice but I've been waiting for an expert to come along and say we can address this. Ever since I started writing books I thought the chef point of view was important, missing in the dialogue. People who are experts who are making food taste good should make it right. I took the recipes out of all the books that did the best. I would skip right to the chocolate chip cookie. This chocolate chip pan cookie -- Isn't that a carb? No. You make it with nut flour or something. That's very few carbs. How many carbs do you need, joy? She's Italian, she doesn't understand. No way that my genetics makeup allows me to not eat a carb. You can get up to 40 carbs a day. That's 8 ounces of pasta. You can't have a piece of You could have a piece of bread. You can't have lasagne. In my book I start out at 20. Break it down for people. What is keto. It's a low carb diet. You restrict carbs and increase fat. You eat a lot of fat. Your body, when it senses an abundance of fat, burns the fat that it's storing. It's like changing tanks. It goes from burning carbohydrates to burning ketones. You do that by eating a lot of fat and a very small amount of carbs. What kind of fat are we talking about? Coconut oil, olive oil would be the best. Butter works, cream cheese works. Butter? Yeah, grass fed butter. You're a fan of that, right? I love butter. I drink a bulletproof coffee with butter and the mct oils which are brain oils. Yeah. It's so weird but it's amazing. You put cream in your coffee right? It's like two steps away. Cream is one thing away from being butter. Meatballs are a recipe that I keep trying to reinvent. You have the greatest meal balls. They're your mothers, aren't they. Yes, but turned into a keto version. They were pretty close. All I had to do was take out the bread crumbs. These are parmigiano-reggiano Yum. Cheese things. Cheese crisps. It's parmigiano-reggiano turned into crackers and treated like bread crumbs. How do you turn them into You can buy them. Did you want to try those? I'm serious. That sounds good. Crumble them up. That's it? You take a hunk of this and crumble it up? Grate it, put it on a sheet pan, put it in the oven and it becomes a cracker. Or you can buy them as cheese crisps and use them with hummus, anything you want rather than a cracker. I see. Let me show you how to make this recipe. These are the three meats normally in the recipe so that hasn't changed. Hot chili pepper, celtic sea salt because it's got all 86 minerals originally found in the sea which are important. Salt is good. Salt is good. Sugar holds water. Opposite the what people think. It's actually a $12 billion industry. A lot of people participating. I'm thrilled to not have to beg people to understand one of my cookbooks. They may remember Atkins. Quickly, I've been chowing down on this. This is delicious. What else is on the table? This is a chocolate chip pan cookie. This is chicken -- Buffalo chicken salad and that's Mac and cheese. It's all keto? And zoodles. What the heck is that? You can have Mac and cheese that's keto? Wait a second, how do you make the Mac -- Try the Mac and cheese and tell me if you like it. I'll bet you a dollar you're going to be okay with that. I trust you. That I would eat. Go family style on this. Take them out and they go in a big pot of sauce of course. Is that cauliflower. Can I have one without the Yes, of course. I like it without the sauce. You can have whatever you want. You are joy Behar. He's throwing food at me. It's delicious. That is amazing, it tastes like macaroni and cheese. The cauliflower does pretty well in a Mac and cheese situation. These are good. You simmer these for about ten minutes, you can go as much as an hour. They come out nice and tender. You guys are familiar with you've had them before. I'm using zoodles now but you can use sea kel P noodles, black bean noodles, soy bean noodles, high protein noodles. You can use two ounces of regular pasta. And you're competing on a new show. I am, yes. Who told you about that? The tournament of champions. Serious. It came out last Wednesday. I'll be on -- I think I'll be on. They sequestered us so we have no idea what's happening. It's head-to-head battles with the most talented chefs in the country. I don't know how I got on the Are you going to eat a vegetable? This is good. Whoopi is eating zoodles, everybody. Because I want to see if it works. This chocolate chip cookie, Meghan and I agreed, just tastes regular. It's delicious. I can't believe you're not trying it, whoopi. I brought the cookie for you. You know I don't eat sugar. I'm the salty girl. This is cauliflower and the sauce is cream cheese, heavy cream -- We got to do this again. Rocco, you nailed it. This is amazing. Thanks to Rocco Dispirito. We'll be right back.

To fund her startup, she tapped into roughly $10,000 of personal savings. And she began networking with the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and women’s business groups. “These women helped me,” she said. “That was a culture shock. People accepted me.”
 The business will start operations in Singapore and the Netherlands this year.
 But she is not done. Hicks is assembling the next group of women to work in skilled-trade industries. With support of the Women’s Entrepreneurship Initiative, a city-funded incubator for women-owned businesses in Atlanta, her latest venture is a career development agency and training center to help women get jobs in male-dominated industries. It will start this summer in Atlanta, with plans for nine more centers to open in cities across the country, including Detroit and Englewood, California.
 “I am tired of being the only, the first,” she said. “I’m working to try to change that. I look at construction as the last frontier for women. I don’t think it’s any better than when I started. It takes a long time to change culture. And it’s not where it needs to be for women to feel there is a real opportunity.”
 Apprenticeships like the one Hicks held provide on-the-job training and are vital to the success of women in the skilled-trade sector. In 2017, however, only 7.3% of those completing registered apprenticeships were women.
 “Growing the number of women in construction or the trades is no small feat,” said C. Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “It takes a tremendous amount of coordination between workforce development programs, labor unions, contractors and the government. These are higher-paying jobs with benefits, and potential for increased earnings over time — all things that are particularly meaningful for working women with families.”
 But change has been incremental.
 “Although huge strides have been made over the last several decades, there does remain a significant lack of diversity of women and women of color in the skilled trades and construction industry,” said Vicki Anderson, the chief executive of Stevens Engineers and Constructors, based in Middleburg Heights, Ohio.
 The obstacles that Hicks encountered more than 20 years ago are still rampant. Sexual harassment is still an issue, according to Carolyn Williams, a retired director of the IBEW Civic and Community Engagement Department. “The biggest challenge for women entering the field is the sexism,” she said. “You think about that environment it has this macho connotation behind it.”
 While the numbers compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are not indicative of a huge increase in women’s participation in the skilled trades, there are many groups offering support, Williams said, and more tradeswomen are recruiting women and educating their unions on the barriers that women face in the skilled trades.
 Programs, like Chicago Women in Trades and Nontraditional Employment for Women in New York City, have built a channel for women entering construction and other traditionally male-dominated fields.
 “Women often get clogged in the pipeline due to the lack of support by male supervisors or co-workers, sexual harassment, or they do not receive the proper training or support to do all aspects of the job,” Mason said. “These jobs are also less flexible and do not provide support services for child care or take into account women’s disproportionate caretaking responsibilities compared to men. As a result, retention of women in nontraditional jobs and skilled trades can be difficult.”

The British government has called a meeting with sports governing bodies and broadcasters on Monday to discuss how they would cope with a broader outbreak of coronavirus, two people familiar with the situation said.
 The department in charge of sport will meet with sporting officials to discuss all outcomes including the possibility that some events could be held behind closed doors, one source said. The department declined to comment. A third person said they have been in regular dialogue with the government for some time.
 Britain's four-phase plan for dealing with the virus is currently in its initial "containment" stage but preparations for the next phase - known as "delay" - are advanced. A planning document published earlier this week said that in the delay phase government would consider taking action to reduce the number of large scale gatherings to help slow the spread of the disease throughout the population.
 One person has died in Britain from the virus so far and more than 160 people have tested positive. Italy has ordered all major sporting events throughout the country, including top-flight Serie A soccer games, to be played without fans for one month in a bid to curb Europe's worst coronavirus outbreak.
 In England, the top-tier soccer Premier League is two thirds of the way through the season and is due to end in May. The Six Nations rugby union contest has already been disrupted, with games in Italy and Ireland postponed. Some matches including the final of the UEFA European Championship are due to be held at London's Wembley Stadium and in June and July.

A better grip means more spin and, as more recent insights of the analytics revolution has shown, more spin means a massive increase in the effectiveness of pitches.

“JRC has provided countless hours of testimony, volumes of information and made clinicians, other staff and family members of our clients, or clients themselves, available to the FDA over the past several years,” it said. “In fact, after multiple requests for the federal agency to visit the only facility impacted by this rule, the FDA stuck its head in the sand and refused to visit.”
 The school administers the electric shocks with a device called a graduated electronic decelerator. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the school said it had 282 clients, 55 of whom — all adults — had been approved by a court to wear the graduated electronic decelerator after all other treatments failed.
 The Judge Rotenberg Educational Center was founded in 1971, and opponents of electric shock devices have fought against it for decades through legislation, lawsuits, petitions and reports that described the shocks as torture.
 In a 2013 report, the United Nations special rapporteur for torture said that the rights of students at the center had been violated under the U.N. convention against torture.
 But legal and legislative efforts did not stop the practice in Massachusetts. And in a recent victory for the center, a probate court judge in Bristol County, Massachusetts, decided in 2018 that defendants in a lawsuit against the center had failed to show that the “aversive treatment used at JRC does not conform to the accepted standard of care for treating individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.”
 The FDA rarely bans devices, and this decision has been in the works since at least 2018. Some proponents of a ban questioned the delay.
 “The FDA finally banning these devices is bittersweet, as action should have been taken a long time ago,” said Karen A. Zahka, a lawyer who represented McCollins, whose shocks were captured on video.
 “For decades, adults and children at the Judge Rotenberg Center have been subjected to this inhumane treatment,” she said. “You can see from the video of Andre McCollins that the United Nations was and is right — it’s torture.”
 Public records show that in recent years, the center has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbying in both New York state (where more than half the center’s students are from) and Massachusetts. It has also spent more than a quarter-million dollars over the past decade on lobbying federal entities, including the FDA, the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives.
 Michael Flammia, a lawyer representing the school, said it planned to appeal the ban. He said the FDA’s decision to approve the use of the shock devices in 1994 had since been bolstered by research showing how effective they were for patients with severe behavioral problems.
 “The FDA isn’t entitled under the law to abandon the science and abandon the scientists and to do something that is politically expedient to them,” Flammia said.
 In its statement on Wednesday, the FDA said it recognized that some students might need a gradual transition period to stop using the shock device.
 “The FDA believes that state-of-the-art behavioral treatments, such as positive behavioral support and medications, can enable health care providers to find alternative approaches for curbing self-injurious or aggressive behaviors in their patients,” it added.
 The Arc, a disability rights organization based in Washington, D.C., said in a statement on Wednesday that it celebrated the decision “after too long of a wait.”
 “The FDA’s decision, years in the making, to ban the use of the electric shock device is a hard-fought victory and a testament to what is possible when disability advocates fight their hardest for change and for the civil rights of people with disabilities,” said Peter Berns, the organization’s top executive. “We hope the ban is a significant step in ending the use of all aversive procedures on people with disabilities, who deserve to be supported with dignity.”

Google, Facebook, and Twitter said they will continue to pay hourly workers even if remote work policies and office closures in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak reduce staffing needs, Axios reported on Thursday evening.
 As COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, continues to spread throughout the Bay Area and Seattle, many tech companies are implementing work-from-home policies, leaving massive office buildings largely empty.
 That shift aised concerns about about the fate of food service, janitorial, administrative, security and other hourly workers who will likely see their hours reduced as a result and cannot do their jobs from home.
 In response, Microsoft announced Thursday that it would continue to pay hourly workers in affected regions even if conditions leave them unable to come into the office, leading other companies to follow suit.
 "Facebook will pay contingent workers that cannot work due to reduced staffing requirements during voluntary work from home, when we close an office, when we choose to send an employee home, or when they are sick," a spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider.

She was a young girl that made a bad decision and she never could come back to it. He said he did it to release -- relieve anxiety. Whatever happened to xanax? Whatever happened to the three Ms and you know what they are. I don't think it was the pressure of the office, it was the power of the office because I think that presidential power probably is intoxicating and I think people do things just because they can and that was a different time in his life. He said to relieve stress. You don't do something to relieve stress -- You should do yoga. -- That's going to cause stress. Men don't always think down the road. It's immediate gratification. He's not just a man. He's the president of the united States. He needed to think twice about what he did and he's sorry and I appreciate that he's very sorry for it and he's sorry about what happened to Monica. He had to he will his daughter. That might have been painful for him. There was a documentary that came out last year about the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the bill clinton-monica Lewinsky scandal and you hear her take on it and I had no idea the things she went through when it happened. She was at the mall trying to get lunch with her friends and she was literally taken into custody by the police and she was scared and didn't know what was going on. She had to find a lawyer. She retells the story about how her life was just totally ruined and ambushed and I actually think -- I follow her on Twitter and I follow her work she does now and I think she's an interesting voice and anti-bullying advocate and I like the person she's become but it's not without these horrible struggles. I do think the me too movement never seems to hit Bill Clinton. Yes, it does. He got oral sex from an intern who was 21, and I don't know, I think he gets a lot of passes in the democratic party. When you go back and reread the way some people covered him like Tina brown and I believe Maureen dowd, they said the fact that he had an affair makes him sexier. Hillary Clinton just said last night on "Watch what happens live" that it's amazing the amount of people that would blame her and say but I'm still a fan of your husband. So don't think there's not a total double standard for men. What I'm talking about with sexism and misogyny in this country. When I look back on when that was happening and what I saw then versus what I see now, it's very different. It's a very different time. That's over 20 years ago. Look at what trump gets away with, my god, compared to that. It's unbelievable. Trump, to my knowledge, hasn't received oral sex in the oval office and I do think there's still a big difference between the desecration of our white house. To me it was the beginning of the end of a lot of things in this country. I hate to say this but the desecration of the white house began long before -- With trump. No, no, it began long before Bill Clinton. You have the Kennedy years and you have -- Oh yeah. Listen, nobody comes out on top on this. There are some great presidents who have not cheated on her wives. There have been great presidents but we're talking about Bill Clinton right now because the effect of all the people who we don't talk about like who was the woman who was posing as her friend? Oh, the -- Linda Tripp. There are all these people that are involved here who have gone on quietly with their lives, who maybe should have had to take care of a lot more stuff, setting her up as they did -- As a reporter.

The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has risen by 49 to 197, the Civil Protection Agency said on Friday, the largest daily increase in fatalities since the contagion was uncovered two weeks ago. Italy is currently reporting more deaths from the virus than any other country in the world and the government this week ordered the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and theatres around the country to try to stem the infections.
 The cumulative number of cases in the country, which has been the hardest hit in Europe by the epidemic, totalled 4,636 compared with 3,858 on Thursday. The Vatican, an independent state that sits in the heart of Rome, also registered its first case on Friday. The national health institute said the average age of those who had died so far was 81, with the vast majority suffering underlying health problems. Just 28% were women.
 The fatality rate from the illness in Italy, which has one of the oldest populations in the world, is running at 4.25%, higher than in most other countries. In a worrying sign for hard-pressed hospitals, the number of patients in intensive care rose more than 30% on Friday to 462. On a more positive note, some 523 people have fully recovered, authorities said, an increase of 26% on the previous tally.
 Analysts say the crisis will push Italy's fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years. Credit ratings agency Moody's on Friday cut its growth forecast for the country to -0.5% in 2020, from a previous +0.5% estimate. Underscoring the economic concerns, the Milan stock exchange fell 3.5% on Friday and is now down 17.4% since news of the first case was announced on Feb. 21.
 The tourism sector, which accounts for 13% of national output, has suffered the hardest immediate hit, with visitors shunning the country out of fear of infection. The Czech Republic said on Friday that anyone returning from trips to Italy would have to go into quarantine for two weeks or face fines, while neighbouring Slovakia said it was banning all flights to and from Italy.
 Rome has previously denounced such moves to isolate the country. There is also widespread annoyance with France, Germany and other EU allies who have imposed curbs on the export of protective medical gear to avoid shortages at home. "So much for the European Union," said Matteo Salvini, head of the opposition, far-right League party.
 "When Italy needs help, doors are closed and wallets shut. Once the health emergency is over, it will be necessary to rethink and rebuild everything, starting from Brussels." Italy's sporting world is also facing unprecedented turmoil.
 The Alpine skiing World Cup finals in Italy's Cortina d'Ampezzo were cancelled on Friday, while a Formula E race scheduled for Rome on April 4 will not now take place, the all-electric series announced on Friday. The Milan-Sanremo one-day cycle race set for later this month has also been cancelled as well as two other cycling events in Italy.

Pretty much everything we're hearing about Marvel's upcoming ensemble blockbuster _Eternals_ has got us excited, from the announcement that it will feature an openly gay superhero and his husband, to the casting of a prominent deaf character, to the eleventh hour surprise casting of _Game of Thrones_ star Kit Harington.
 And now Kumail Nanjiani, who sent the internet into a tailspin with his superhero transformation while shooting, has just dropped a tidbit which makes the whole thing sound even greater: _Eternals_ __will feature a bona fide musical number.
 Speaking to _Deadline_ 's ___New Hollywood_ podcast, Nanjiani offered up some info on his character, Kingo, one of the titular Eternals who have spent millennia living on Earth in order to secretly defend it from the creatures known as Deviants.
 "A lot of it takes place in the present day," he said. "My character, for instance, is like, 'OK we're supposed to keep a low profile, no-one should know'. So I become a Bollywood movie star, that's my secret identity. We're supposed to keep quiet, and I've become the biggest Bollywood movie star."
 This wouldn't be the first time that a character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has failed to fully grasp the notion of a secret identity (we're looking at you, Iron Man), but Kingo's cover as a Bollywood actor led to the inclusion of more diverse performers in the movie -- particularly in a musical sequence featuring Nanjiani and a whole lot of Bollywood background performers.
 Nanjiani went on to describe how it felt to shoot the scene, which featured quite possibly the largest South Asian cast in the history of the MCU. "I remember the first time I went to rehearsal, I walked in and there were all these South Asian people," he said. "I was so moved immediately. I was like, 'Oh my god, we went from none of us to so many in one scene."
 Fans can see the Bollywood number for themselves when _Eternals_ is released on November 6. __

With less than a month left in the season, the Washington Capitals visit to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday at PPG Paints Arena is shaping up as a sizable Metropolitan Division showdown. Washington 40-20-7 is tied with Philadelphia in points atop the division after falling to the New York Rangers 6-5 in overtime Thursday while the Flyers beat Carolina that night. The Capitals have the edge by one in regulation and overtime wins for a potential tiebreaker.Pittsburgh 39-21-6 is third, three points behind those two clubs. The Capitals have led the Metropolitan most of the season, but their 4-7-2 showing over their past 13 games has loosened the grip. Before the Flyers caught up in points, the Penguins briefly moved into first last month.That has led to some angst over their play at this critical stretch. Its got to be five guys playing offense and five guys playing defense, and right now were not getting that, Washington center Lars Eller told the Washington Post.Two years after they won the Stanley Cup, the Capitals are feeling the need to make a push sooner rather than later if they want to have a shot at another. Its got to be now, goaltender Braden Holtby told the Post. Look at the last few years. The teams that win get going now.With a late goal to get Washington into overtime Thursday, Alex Ovechkin moved into a tie with Bostons David Pastrnak for first in the NHL in goals with 47. Pittsburgh has won two straight coming off a six-game losing streak. The game against Washington marks the start of 10 in a row inside the Metropolitan, and 14 of their final 16 are against division foes.Perhaps not coincidentally, the team has had its full contingent on defense the past two games for the first time since Nov. 30. The Penguins are still missing three regular forwards, Jake Guentzel, Dominik Simon and Zach Aston-Reese, but are about as healthy as they have been in a season marked by loads of injuries.If youre going to win the Cup, its four lines, six defensemen, and a couple of good goalies as well, said center Nick Bjugstad, who had an assist Thursday in his first game since Nov. 15 after having core muscle surgery. You need as many contributions as you can get. We had a decent amount of guys injured, and this team has found a way with younger guys, call-ups. Its reassuring, but we cant let our foot off the pedal here. These games are important going forward. I think you want to be confident going into the playoffs.Penguins center Evgeni Malkin has six assists during the two-game winning streak. The game at Buffalo also marked an interesting situation with the Pittsburgh goaltending. After rotating evenly between Matt Murray and Tristan Jarry for a month, Murray started for the second game in a row. He made 28 saves, including a couple critical ones, against the Sabres.Its not clear whether the Penguins have moved the arrow toward Murray in setting up one goalie to prepare for the workload of the playoffs. Coach Mike Sullivan was mum on whether Murray would get a third straight start Saturday. Well make a decision as we always do, he said.--Field Level Media

Voters will have a tough time deciding what non-musical outings make the cut as well. “Slave Play,” “The Sound Inside,” and “The Inheritance” have already made strong claims to the Best Play trophy and have been the big conversation starters of the fall season. Comedy lovers have also fallen for “Linda Vista” and “Grand Horizons.” But those artistic highs don’t even cover the eagerly anticipated spring shows like “The Lehman Trilogy” (where director Sam Mendes hopes to recover from his Oscar loss), Martin McDonagh’s “Hangmen,” Tracy Letts’ “The Minutes,” or Noah Haidle’s “Birthday Candles.”

Yesterday senator Elizabeth Warren announced she was spending her presidential campaign and she opened up about it in a press conference outside her home and on Rachel Maddow's show last night. Take a look. One of the hardest parts of this is all those promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. There's a feeling that your campaign ending is very specific to you and it also feels a little bit like a death knell in terms of the prospects of having a woman for president in our lifetimes. Oh god, please no. That can't be right. You know what I'm talking about. I know exactly what you're talking about. I know exactly what you're talking about. This cannot be the right answer. Well, all the great women that are still out there, I don't think anybody thinks they're not going to run. I mean, I want Stacey Abrams to run at some point. I want her out there. You know, there are a lot of -- I think women, this idea that now there's not going to be -- it took us, what, 150 years to get a black president and we were shocked as hell about that. Well -- I think the feeling is -- and I have a really good friend who's a diehard Warren supporter and she's really upset. I talked to her yesterday. I think there's this feeling that I believe she's a much better candidate than Bernie. She's smarter, more llikable. She completely knocked Bloomberg out at the knees. There's a feeling where you have people like klobuchar, Warren, kamala Harris who's a sitting senator who gender did really come into play. The way they're covered by the media, it's the way they look, they're too likable, they're not likable enough. They're too shrill. She's not smart enough, not warm enough. I think there's a feeling of exhaustion among a lot of American women, like when is the media going throw some of these female candidates -- by the way, not just presidential candidates but candidates across the board and women in politics across the board. When are we going to start treating them like men. I'm always hopeful that each election cycle they will and then I'm disappointed that they don't. By the way, this is something that's been going on our entire life times. I saw it front and center with Sarah Palin. They're just treated differently. Elizabeth Warren has a very classy response. I'm almost done. She says, if I complain about it I'm a whiner, and if I don't recognize it I loo delusional. I think that was a great answer. In the patriarchy that we find ourselves, a man can be angry, a woman with not be. Bernie is always angry. I like him very much. But he always comes across as angry. Elizabeth Warren can't come across that way. They have similar agendas, the two of them, too, and we accept it in him and not in her. In a normal year without the horror show that's going on in the white house right now, I think that a woman could have had a better chance, but we are in an emergency situation and we could not take a chance on the misogynists in this country ruining for a women and that's what is happening right now. That doesn't mean it's going to happen again. I don't think it will next time. People are getting smarter. I think it would be intellectually dishonest not to say a woman plays into it, of course. For me Elizabeth Warren wasn't the right candidate for me politically and I would never insult a woman enough to say I only voted for you because I'm a woman and you're a woman. What about klobuchar? She was different from Warren. I was a mayor Pete person. I really liked him. I really liked Andrew yang. I think the moderate, the closer to the middle you are, that probably is more representative of most people in this country. That's right. Whether we hear enough of it. So I think she was too far left for me, but I also -- There's a lot of people she was too far left for. I also think we need to stop putting people so much into categories. Not every black person thinks like every black person. Not every woman thinks like every woman. Not every young person thinks like every young person. We're more nuanced individual to individual. There are probably men that think more like me than a lot of women do. But you can't dismiss the misogyny and the sexism in the it's there. We're all raised in the same I probably have the same misogyny. I wasn't raised at the same time you were. Joy, I was bringing you down. Experience, darling. Taylor Swift said something that hit me, I had to rid myself of my own misogyny. It's like someone that comes out. People assume that if they're gay, it's okay to be gay. They have a battle themselves. It's consciousness raising. I think progress is being raised when you look at the progress that we have. Yes, we have two white guys -- Old white guys. I was doing them a solid. Point is we're making progress. Those stages are starting to be more colorful. 60 years ago this didn't happen. Yeah. There weren't women. 60 years ago, not long ago at I think for me I was always raised -- my dad told me, you can be president, Meghan. I feel like if I had a child right now and it was a girl, I don't know what I'd say anymore because I do think -- there's this quote, where's my jet pack? Where is my woman president. Like why are we still here as Americans, and I think it's frustrating. For me I'd love it to be a conservative woman, happy if it's Nikki Haley but I do think women traditionally are better leaders in a lot of situations because we're more compassionate. More collaborative. For me, I'm 35. I'm going to be 36 by the next election or almost, yeah, 36 the next election. Where is my woman president? Maybe you should run. Would you vote for me, joy? Maybe -- you know what, let

The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has risen by 49 to 197, the Civil Protection Agency said on Friday, the largest daily increase in fatalities since the contagion was uncovered two weeks ago. Italy is currently reporting more deaths from the virus than any other country in the world and the government this week ordered the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and theatres around the country to try to stem the infections.The cumulative number of cases in the country, which has been the hardest hit in Europe by the epidemic, totalled 4,636 compared with 3,858 on Thursday. The Vatican, an independent state that sits in the heart of Rome, also registered its first case on Friday. The national health institute said the average age of those who had died so far was 81, with the vast majority suffering underlying health problems. Just 28 were women.The fatality rate from the illness in Italy, which has one of the oldest populations in the world, is running at 4.25, higher than in most other countries. In a worrying sign for hard-pressed hospitals, the number of patients in intensive care rose more than 30 on Friday to 462. On a more positive note, some 523 people have fully recovered, authorities said, an increase of 26 on the previous tally.Analysts say the crisis will push Italys fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years. Credit ratings agency Moodys on Friday cut its growth forecast for the country to -0.5 in 2020, from a previous 0.5 estimate. Underscoring the economic concerns, the Milan stock exchange fell 3.5 on Friday and is now down 17.4 since news of the first case was announced on Feb. 21.The tourism sector, which accounts for 13 of national output, has suffered the hardest immediate hit, with visitors shunning the country out of fear of infection. The Czech Republic said on Friday that anyone returning from trips to Italy would have to go into quarantine for two weeks or face fines, while neighbouring Slovakia said it was banning all flights to and from Italy.Rome has previously denounced such moves to isolate the country. There is also widespread annoyance with France, Germany and other EU allies who have imposed curbs on the export of protective medical gear to avoid shortages at home. So much for the European Union, said Matteo Salvini, head of the opposition, far- right League party.When Italy needs help, doors are closed and wallets shut. Once the health emergency is over, it will be necessary to rethink and rebuild everything, starting from Brussels. Italys sporting world is also facing unprecedented turmoil.The Alpine skiing World Cup finals in Italys Cortina dAmpezzo were cancelled on Friday, while a Formula E race scheduled for Rome on April 4 will not now take place, the all-electric series announced on Friday. The Milan-Sanremo one-day cycle race set for later this month has also been cancelled as well as two other cycling events in Italy.Top flight Serie A soccer matches are due to be played this weekend, but behind closed doors.
