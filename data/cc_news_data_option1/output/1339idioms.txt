Since this is a world-wide problem, there may also be a silver lining. The planet's most brilliant minds are relentlessly working around the clock on solutions that are changing healthcare and its delivery faster and better than anyone could have ever imagined. There are dozens of leading companies that have or will have a vaccine in human clinical trials. There are also promising remedies being tested as we speak. There is even evidence that when a vaccine is developed, a single dose, rather than a yearly flu vaccine, would be needed to prevent a further occurrence.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As the first alarms sounded in early January that an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China might ignite a global pandemic, the Trump administration squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal stockpile of critically needed medical supplies and equipment. A review of federal purchasing contracts by The Associated Press shows federal agencies waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers. By that time, hospitals in several states were treating thousands of infected patients without adequate equipment and were pleading for shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile. That federal cache of supplies was created more than 20 years ago to help bridge gaps in the medical and pharmaceutical supply chains during a national emergency. Now, three months into the crisis, that stockpile is nearly drained just as the numbers of patients needing critical care is surging. Some state and local officials report receiving broken ventilators and decade-old dry-rotted masks. “We basically wasted two months,” Kathleen Sebelius, health and human services secretary during the Obama administration, told AP. As early as mid-January, U.S. officials could see that hospitals in China's Hubei province were overwhelmed with infected patients, with many left dependent on ventilator machines to breath. Italy soon followed, with hospitals scrambling for doctors, beds and equipment. HHS did not respond to questions about why federal officials waited to order medical supplies until stocks were running critically low. But President Donald Trump has asserted that the federal government should take a back seat to states when it...

New Delhi, Apr 5 (PTI) Economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic may have warranted several compliance and financial reporting relaxations, but experts and officials cautioned on Sunday that relaxing the mandatory closure of trading window for 'insiders' might go against the interest of investors.
 There has been demand from promoters and others classified as insiders with regard to stock market trading that this restriction should also be relaxed as capital markets regulator has eased the timelines for filing of financial results for listed companies.
 Under the Sebi's Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations, "Trading restriction period shall be made applicable from the end of every quarter till 48 hours after the declaration of financial results. The gap between clearance of accounts by audit committee and board meeting should be as narrow as possible and preferably on the same day to avoid leakage of material information."
 Accordingly, the trading window closure for insiders is already in place since April 1, though the timeline for filing of results for the quarter and year ended March 31 has been relaxed till June 30.
 These are among the relaxations given by Sebi for listed companies and various market participants in light of the COVID-19 crisis and the ongoing nationwide lockdown.
 While promoters and other insiders are demanding that the trading window should be opened for them as results would be announced later, officials and experts flagged such a relaxation would be detrimental to the interest of general investors as promoters and the top management, alongwith their associated entities, would already be in know of broader financial performance for the last quarter even if the actual results would get filed later.
 Confirming that there have been requests seeking relaxation from the trading restriction period, a government official said the challenge for regulator Sebi was striking a balance between granting relaxations and ensuring market integrity.
 Exchanges have already issued circulars regarding the trading window closure as Sebi did not accede to requests for any relaxation. Globally also, no such relaxation has been given by regulators in major markets. Information relating to financial results, unless made public, is deemed as unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) and insiders who may have access to such UPSI are not allowed to trade.
 "It would be incorrect to infer from the above developments that promoters and insiders cannot trade till June 30, 2020 as there is no mandate from Sebi to delay the financial results, instead a listed entity is free to stick to its timelines and open the trading window as per extant provisions of law," the official said.
 Companies are free to publish their results before June 30 and get out of the trading window relaxation, he added.
 "A blanket extension to all would not have been in the interest of investors as there may be companies whose financial results may otherwise be in advanced stage or also may be indicative enough so as to qualify them as UPSI but likely to be kept in abeyance by certain entities in case trading window relaxation is granted.
 "Also, the date of financial results having reached such a stage would vary for each company and there would be no mechanism to verify the same and prevent likely misuse by insiders," the official added.
 "Filing of financial results within specified timeline is obligatory and hence justifiable for consideration of relaxation in wake of recent developments while dealing in securities is not an obligation but just an option," said a securities market lawyer.
 "Significant volatility has been seen in securities market globally due to developments relating to COVID-19. In such a situation, insiders may have tremendous incentive and opportunity to trade on UPSI and therefore it needs to be checked," said another market observer who did not wish to be identified.
 "The decision of Sebi is keeping in mind its mandate of protecting the interest of investors. Maintaining confidence in the fairness and integrity of our markets assumes even greater significance in present dynamic and unique circumstances, in wake of COVD-19," another official said.

The fifth-seeded Jets (42-17) won their first national title by defeating third-seed Mesa, 5-4, Friday night in the championship game of the NJCAA Division II World Series at David Allen Memorial Ballpark.
 Sophomore Dylan Caplinger gave the Jets the game-winning run in the top of the ninth inning. Tied 4-4, Caplinger swung on a 2-0 count and sent the ball behind the left field wall.
 “Just trying to hit something hard,” Caplinger said.
 Freshman pitcher Brandon Hudson shut the door on the Thunderbirds’ (44-23) last-chance rally in the bottom of the ninth to seal the Jets’ victory. After striking out two batters, Mesa put two men on and the tying run on second base.
 In front of a record-breaking crowd of more than 4,200, Hudson refused to show his nerves.
 “They’re all counting on you and you don’t want to let anyone down,” Hudson said.
 Hudson threw his final pitch to Luke Patty, who sent the ball soaring to right field and into Tanner Neely’s glove.
 The Jets had finally done it.
 After nearly two decades, after three previous attempts and a year after coming up short of the championship round, NOC Enid is a national champion.
 NOC Enid head coach Raydon Leaton stood on the field during the postgame ceremony. His hands rested on his knees. His body hunched over. All season he kept the emotions calm. But on that field, amongst his team, his assistant coaches and what seemed like the entire city of Enid, he let his emotions go.
 “Been built up,” Leaton said.
 Hours before winning their first World Series title, the Jets watched video after video from NOC Enid alumni offering encouragement before heading into a game none of them had been able to reach.
 “It was so heartfelt,” Leaton said. “I had to gather myself then, as well. This goes way beyond this team. It’s a huge alumni.”
 The Jets and Thunderbirds played as close a game as any in the tournament. Neither team led by more than two runs and each side held a lead before seeing it evaporate. Mesa drew first blood with a two-run, two-hit third inning.
 NOC Enid didn’t wait long to answer Mesa’s two-run inning. In the top of the fourth inning, sophomore E.J. Taylor hit his third home run of the World Series, his 15th of the season, to cut Mesa’s lead to one run. Taylor took his first pitch from Mesa starter Carter Robinson and sent the ball over the centerfield wall for the solo homer. It was only Robinson’s third home run allowed this year.
 Taylor said before the game, he and teammates said nothing mattered after Friday. Forget stats or the ups and downs of the game.
 “We just wanted to come out as national champions,” he said.
 It’s been a long two years for sophomores like Taylor who were on the third- place team in last year’s World Series.

A batsman can do with yoga and weight training but for the merchants of speed, former India pacer Ashish Nehra feels the absence of running for more than three months at a stretch could come in their way of fitness. According to him, the fast bowlers will have to start running sooner or later. India is in the second week of a three-week lockdown enforced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than 70 lives while infecting over 3000 people.
 With sporting activities coming to a standstill, the elite athletes are confined to their homes, trying to remain fit while hoping for action to begin once normalcy returns.
 "Let's consider a few situations. Even if the lockdown ends on April 15, it will take a lot of time for social life to become normal. "If you ask me, I am not expecting any cricketing activity before July. So this is a long break but once action starts fast bowlers have the biggest challenge to remain fit," Nehra told PTI during an interaction.
 Just like former India team physio John Gloster, Nehra also feels that the paucity of space for most cricketers is a problem and more so for the fast bowlers.
 "Lack of running time for fast bowlers is an issue. Now the situation is unavoidable. So whoever at least has a garden with say 15 metres or 20 metres space, they should do shuttle run thrice a week unless they are allowed to train at grounds," said Nehra.
 Shuttle run comprises short strides between 20 to 40 metres where players run between points A and B.
 "You can do as much of yoga or free weights, fast bowler's life is nothing without good running time. There is a lot of difference with batsmen," said Nehra, who has been a bowling coach with IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore.
 Why does one need to run more than say cycling or swimming? "It's not just about heart-rate but also about bowling muscles such as hamstring, glutes, groin and calf, they remain activated. Giving a choice between swimming, cycling and running, as a cricketer I would say running. Also a bit of shadow bowling can help in visualization," said Nehra, who has played 164 internationals for India (17 Tests, 120 ODIs and 27 T20Is).
 He had a word of advice for those who have sprawling terraces with soil and grass cover.
 "It's fine if you are doing Surya Namaskar on terrace but if you start running and doing shuttle run, you will end up damaging your knees and ankles because of hard surface.The very reason that professional players should avoid playing tennis on hard courts in five-star hotels. They are cement courts."
 Nehra said that he is confident whether it's the BCCI or ICC, even if there is a semblance of normalcy by June, they will give at least a month's time to the players to prepare, as one can't suddenly start playing.
 "And injuries can happen to anyone. The fast bowler who has trained the least might be fitter than fast bowler who has trained the most. Nature of sport is such. But yes, I hope that if lockdown ends, they have access to grounds," said Nehra.
 And he also had a word of caution for fast bowlers and professional players in general.
 "Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra, after this prolonged break, can afford to come back with a paunch. Not active players. So break ka matlab ye naahi ki biryani khaani hain (A break from sport doesn't mean you will have biryani)."

JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's Denel will design and develop medical ventilators in partnership with other state-owned entities, research bodies and medical technology companies to help treat coronavirus patients, the state arms and technology company said on Sunday.
 Governments and hospitals globally have pleaded with manufacturers to speed up production of ventilators to cope with a surge in patients struggling to breathe.
 Danie du Toit, group chief executive of Denel, said in a statement engineers from Denel Dynamics and Denel Aeronautics were already working round the clock on Project Sabela to produce the ventilators, without giving a target figure.
 "We are still in the early stages of the project, but we are optimistic that this local initiative will help to alleviate the dire need for medical ventilators that are required in great numbers at both public and private hospitals," Du Toit said.
 A task force has been formed consisting of experts from Denel, Armscor, which acquires defense materiel on behalf of the Department of Defence, power utility Eskom, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and other entities to investigate designs and produce a prototype of a local medical ventilator.
 Du Toit said he was confident the team would soon make huge strides in producing the ventilators at a time of global shortages.
 On Saturday, the African Union called for international cooperation and support while up scaling local production of medical supplies and equipment on the continent given the urgent need for it.
 Denel, a cornerstone of South Africa's once-mighty defense industry, is also considering other initiatives in which it could repurpose its current operations and technology to assist the national effort to tackle to health crisis.
 This includes looking at options to produce sanitisers for industrial and medical uses once product certification issues have been clarified and converting Casspir mine-protected vehicles into ambulances, the firm said.
 South Africa has reported 1,585 coronavirus cases as of late Saturday, with nine deaths.
 The ministry of health has approached President Cyril Ramaphosa to assist the department "with mobilizing reinforcements" from various countries such as Cuba and China, it said on Saturday.
 On the same day, Ramaphosa said he spoke to Russia's President Vladimir Putin and "asked for technical expertise on infection control, supply of lifesaving equipment for mobile testing and infection control."
 South African officials have imposed some of the toughest anti-coronavirus measures on the continent, including a 21-day "stay at home" lockdown that started on March 27. (Reporting by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Mark Potter)

Among the notable figures that Washington met with at Mount Vernon were James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry and George Mason, who grappled with questions of how all could live together in this new nation.
 “The meetings that Washington held in the Front Parlor bring a great lesson for our youth (and adults) of today,” Wickens said. “He learned a great deal by listening to others. Even if he was the most important person in the room, he paid attention to what everyone else had to say because he valued their expertise in making what would be crucial decisions.”
 After his father died when he was 11, Washington did not have the opportunity to receive a formal education that his peers had. “He acknowledged that his lack of schooling put him at a disadvantage at times. Others were more well- read, but, ultimately, he was the one who was responsible for the decisions,” Wickens said.
 The meetings Washington held at Mount Vernon with advisers are echoed in “Be Washington,” an interactive digital game that is available online (and on- site) and can be played independently or with multiple players at play.bewashington.org.
 The game sets the stage with four scenarios in which fateful decisions that impacted the direction of our nation were made as Washington moved from leading the Revolution to forming the government of the nascent county. Players watch videos depicting the challenge, hear what his advisers said, and then make their choice of action and learn whether or not it coincided with Washington’s.
 In addition, a series of videos includes “A More Perfect Union” and its companion website “Building the Constitution” that consider the enormous challenge of moving the government of our new nation beyond the original Articles of Confederation to an actual constitution that could balance the various needs and interests of its diverse constituents and stand the test of time.
 Other video presentations offer “firsthand” interviews with members of the enslaved community at the estate. Students may also enjoy interactive exploration of topics such as Washington’s Travels and test their knowledge through quizzes and games. Younger visitors can access coloring pages that can be printed and colored with their own crayons or the website’s “virtual colored pencils.”
 “Our goal in offering all these digital resources is to help people today connect with George Washington and the world he lived in,” Wickens said. “He was a leader who achieved so much, but we also want our visitors to see that he was a real person, making tough decisions.”
 All these offerings, and more, can be accessed at MountVernon.org/digital.

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Across the state of Wyoming, there are web developers who specialize in coding mobile applications, makers who use 3D printers to bring ideas to life and mapping professionals who use GIS to show data visually. So as Array School of Technology and Design CEO Eric Trowbridge watched coronavirus impact communities around the world, he started brainstorming ways to bring Wyomingites in the tech community together to find solutions. With Array leading the charge, the Wyoming Technology Coronavirus Coalition was formed March 17. Since then, the network has grown to more than 200 volunteers with different ideas to help the people of Wyoming in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. “We need to bring the tech community around the state of Wyoming together once and for all, and all collaborate and work together,” Trowbridge said. “This pandemic has really given us a way to solidify that.” In Laramie, the University of Wyoming’s Engineering Education and Research Building Student Innovation Center has almost $1.4 million worth of brand new equipment, including 3D printers. Now, under the leadership of Makerspace Coordinator Tyler Kerr, those 3D printers are being used to make surgical masks for hospitals across the state as part of the coalition.

 People turning against Asian Americans in an uncertain time and sputtering economy echoes the climate in 1982, when Vincent Chin was killed in Detroit as laid-off autoworkers blamed a recession on Japanese competition.
 "At that time, I knew I had to watch out and be careful — who I was around, how they looked at me," said Helen Zia, a Chinese American author and journalist from Oakland, California, who lived in Detroit at the time. "I think we're in that stage now."
 Two white autoworkers beat Chin to death with a bat outside a strip club during his bachelor party simply because they thought he was Japanese. The 27-year-old's attackers were convicted of manslaughter and got just three years of probation.

It is critical for us to understand that India's conditions are unique. We will be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy," wrote former president of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, in a letter to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. Having been the first to warn the nation about the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), Gandhi pledged full support to the PM in the fight against it and called for a more "nuanced" strategy to counter the virus, while acknowledging India's distinct realities. How unique is India, and why is a total lockdown not an optimum strategy?First, comparing data of Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations, deaths and fatalities across different countries is absurd and misleading. Every nation has different testing strategies, demographics, and data integrity. To claim that the United States (US) has more Covid-19 cases than India, or that Italy has a higher fatality rate than Germany is like comparing guns, germs and steel. Such cross-country analyses have only added noise to this grave crisis.Many developed nations such as the US, the United Kingdom (UK ), France, Italy have adopted a strategy of social distancing through lockdown to prevent the rapid spread of the virus. India too jumped on the bandwagon, but with an extreme and absolute national three- week lockdown and is likely to extend it further.A lockdown impacts daily wage workers who must step out to work every day to feed themselves and their families. Less than a fifth of the workforce in the US, Italy and the UK are such daily wage workers. But in India, 90% of all workers are. So, the scale of the impact of a total lockdown in India is exponentially larger than in other nations. The very idea of social distancing rests on the premise that the virus can be contained within small households of two to four people. More than 90% of all households in developed countries have less than four members. But, more than three-quarters of all households in India have more than five members. In nearly all poor households, there are more than six members, again unique to India. Social distancing through lockdown has been portrayed as a Sophie's choice, where there is a trade-off between a massive adverse impact on the economy and stopping the spread of the virus. It is a "dollars versus lives" conundrum in western nations and in that, the case for "lives" should always win.However, in India, it is not "rupees versus lives" but a "lives versus lives" dichotomy. There are already reports of many deaths due to hunger and hardships to migrant populations caused by the sudden and absolute lockdown. Millions of migrant workers have been left stranded amid heart- wrenching images of them being made to frog jump, squat and sprayed with chemicals. Deaths due to hunger, homelessness and isolation are imminent. Intangible social costs of ostracisation and humiliation by local communities may claim many more lives. None of these deaths will be measured and documented in charts, as ardently as the ones caused by Covid-19. Media reports indicate that the deaths by the lockdown are already similar in the count to the deaths by the coronavirus. Shamefully, this is also unique to India. Given India's social structure, the efficacy of an extreme lockdown will also be much lower here than in developed nations. So India may not experience the full benefits of an extreme lockdown, but will be saddled with the enormous human and economic costs of it.It is often remarked that the government must provide a wide safety net of food, shelter and income, and, thereby, ensure that the lockdown is smooth. Yes, the government has woefully fallen short and must do more in protecting the poor and vulnerable during these tumultuous times. But it is also acknowledged that India has a weak State capacity for welfare delivery. It is then naive to believe that a weak State can dramatically transform itself from an inefficient monster to an efficient angel overnight, and ensure that cash, food and shelter are delivered down to the last affected Indian.India's inordinately large share of daily wage workers, high population density in homes, a notoriously inefficient government welfare architecture and a massive humanitarian crisis from the current extreme lockdown is a given.It is also a given that the Covid-19 epidemic is extremely infectious, fatal for the elderly, can overwhelm hospital capacity and can be highly asymptomatic. It is then imperative that we adopt a nuanced strategy to counter this complex threat.Ninety-five per cent of India's population is below the age of 60. Covid-19 is fatal largely for people above 60. It is then possible to look at age-specific isolations, hospitalisation and treatment, which narrows the problem down to 5% of the population. Localised lockdown measures in specific states, districts and blocks based on migration patterns can be an alternative to a national lockdown. Ubiquitous testing through the private sector and isolating positive cases can be another targeted strategy. Spreading out work timings over multiple shifts can be yet another approach. I am sure many people will have several other ideas for a more balanced approach to social distancing than the current extreme and absolute lockdown strategy.It is important to shift from the current "extreme lockdown versus death by Covid-19" binary to a more nuanced debate. Moving from a total lockdown to a more targeted lockdown is perhaps the more viable and better option for India. John Maynard Keynes' "in the long run we are all dead" is often quoted in such times but for millions of Indians, the long run is about surviving today for tomorrow.Praveen Chakravarty is a political economist and a senior office- bearer of the CongressThe views expressed are personal

--DocBreak--
Robbio (Italy), Apr 5 (AFP) The mayor of a pandemic-hit Italian town is trying to get everyone's blood tested in a controversial attempt to end weeks of confinement and finally get people back to work. Most Italian authorities wish he would stop.
 The story of Robbio mayor Roberto Francese has generated a fair bit of interest in a Mediterranean country where people's primary mission is to not catch COVID-19.
 The nation of 60 million has effectively shut down for business to stop the spread of a virus that has officially killed 15,362 people and quite possibly many more.
 No one is sure how the old way of life can resume without setting off a second pandemic wave.
 Into this debate stepped Francese -- a self-confident mayor of a town of 6,000 in Italy's northwest that primarily grows rice.
 "We can never improve the situation without separating the healthy from the sick," Francese told AFP.
 "That is what the blood test is for."
 Separating the healthy from the sick in a 21st century Western democracy might strike some as a mad idea from a bad science fiction film.
 The Robbio mayor has no such qualms and wants everyone immediately tested for antibodies.
 The idea is that people who get infected with the new disease and survive develop at least some immunity against it.
 These are the antibodies that show up in blood tests -- akin to a tell-tale scar from a wound.
 But COVID-19 is a new disease and the science is not there yet to confirm whether coronavirus antibodies will actually make us safe.
 The private blood tests are also fairly expensive -- around 45 euros ($50) each -- and are still undergoing certification in most countries to make sure they actually work.
 Italy's ISS public health institute clearly states that "there are currently no commercial kits to confirm the diagnosis" of the novel coronavirus through blood tests.
 Francese is not deterred by any of this.
 "I will pay for all those who cannot afford it," he said at a town gym where the blood tests were being given by nurses in green coveralls.
 "My citizens know it, they come here and say, 'The mayor is paying for it'." Francese also brushes off the regional authorities' decision to ban laboratories from accepting the town's tests for processing.
 He is getting a private company to process the 1,000 blood samples taken in the past three days.
 Robbio's battle over blood tests may soon be replicated across Europe as countries try to work their way out of economically devastating -- and socially traumatic -- lockdowns.
 The Italian government reportedly intends to secure a load of certified tests kits to see how many people actually have antibodies -- and what this might possibly mean given that at the moment there is no vaccine or readily available treament for COVID-19.
 The locals in Robbio think they know what it means already.
 "The people who develop antibodies cannot be reinfected," the project's scientific coordinator Andrea Desse told AFP.
 "This is what will allow us to return to normal." An urgent need for normality feels overpowering in a town whose region has been living with some of Europe's strictest social distancing measures since late February.
 Robbio's Lombardy region recorded Italy's first COVID-19 death on February 21 and closed almost all forms of street life a few days later.
 "It is complicated for me at the moment, professionally," said self-employed obstetrician Martina De Luca.
 "So I decided to take part," she said.
 "People are happy to take these tests because there are very few of them in Italy at the moment." Most of Italy's national restrictions are expected to run at least through the end of the month. (AFP)

Soon after Syd and David shared a startling come across, he was pressured to confront the stunning likelihood that the voices he hears and the visions he sees may truly be genuine. Syd led David to “Melanie Bird” (Jean Smart), a demanding but nurturing therapist who heads a staff of professionals – “Ptonomy” (Jeremie Harris), “Kerry” (Amber Midthunder) and “Cary” (Bill Irwin) – each of whom possesses a one of a kind and incredible reward. Collectively, they assisted David to identify and harness his hidden powers. With their assistance, David lastly unlocked a deeply suppressed truth – he had been haunted his complete existence by a destructive parasite of unimaginable ability. Recognised as the “Shadow King,” this malevolent creature appeared in the variety of David’s pal “Lenny” (Aubrey Plaza), but is really an historical currently being named “Amahl Farouk.” In an epic showdown, David and his mates battled his demon, in the long run forcing it from David’s body. Unfortunately, Farouk discovered a new host – Melanie’s partner “Oliver Bird” (Jemaine Clement) – and escaped. Just when they assumed they’d acquired a minute of respite, a mysterious orb appeared and took David away to an mysterious position.

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The reusable plastic face masks designed for 3D printers by a college graduate and a pair of local medical professionals have gone global. The free open-source software file they created has been downloaded or shared in 148 countries across six continents. Dubbed the Montana Mask, the design has now made the jump from 3D printers to injection mold production, crafted by the Bozeman company Spark R&D, T he Billings Gazette reported. That move allows for much faster mass production and gives the masks a more comfortable feel. Injection mold production can use materials that are softer and more flexible than the plastic required by 3D printers. “It’s been really cool to see,” said Colton Zaugg, a college graduate with a degree in microbiology. Colton; his father, Spencer Zaugg, a Billings dentist; and their friend, Dusty Richardson, a neurosurgeon at Billings Clinic, worked together in March to design a face mask with a replaceable filter that can be produced from a 3D printer. Once they got a prototype they were happy with, the trio posted the code for free online. The story gained national attention and last week a past employee of Spark R&D reached out to the company’s owner, Will Ritter, on Facebook asking if there was something Spark could do in its production shop. Ritter was intrigued and called around to some contacts he had in the health care industry in Bozeman to find out how legitimate the masks were. “I didn’t want to jump the gun, so to speak,” he said. “I didn’t want to waste their time. I didn’t want to waste our time.” By Thursday he had connected with Richardson, and the two immediately got to work on a design that would work with injection mold production.

 Congress MLA from Gwalior (South) Praveen Pathak, in a video message uploaded on social media on Sunday, urged people to light up lamps for nine minutes by rising above party politics and in honour of the prime minister.
 When asked about it, Pathak told PTI that it is a matter of country's unity and not everything should be looked from a political angle.

Every news outlet is focused on the coronavirus. The vast majority of American citizens are fixated on it. That means nearly everything that's happening in government today is being influenced by the coronavirus even if it's not directly attached to it. When I refer to a "Coronavirus Government," I mean one in which every decision is made within the context of the disease. That's more dangerous in the long term than the disease itself, or even the economic fallout we're already experiencing.

For retailers in the U.S. market, the lost revenue comes at the most pivotal time in the spring season and hits precisely when regular price selling takes place across most categories. The missed Easter and warmer weather sales will significantly impact the margins and may have a long-term impact on future goods in the pipeline or en route to stores. Bitar cautions, “There are several scenarios that could play out when stores reopen, and having the right data and reporting structure in place will be even more crucial to understand both short-term and long-term impact. If retailers aren't able to quickly analyze their fleets, run tests and execute nimbly as they do online, they fall behind competitors who are able to react swiftly.’

New Delhi, Apr 5 (PTI) With multi-pronged strategies in place for IL&FS; resolution, the government expects "substantial recovery" against the group's Rs 94,000 crore external debt and the recovered amount could be much more than the sum realised under the insolvency law so far.
 Apart from the exercise of recasting the financial statements, an SFIO probe report regarding an IL&FS; subsidiary is nearing completion and some matters are before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and the Bombay High Court.
 In late 2018, the problems at IL&FS; came to light after some group companies defaulted on loan repayments resulting in concerns about overall impact on the financial system. The group's board was superseded by the corporate affairs ministry and various entities, including auditors and independent directors, came under the regulatory scanner for the alleged lapses.
 While noting that the maze of transactions between hundreds of subsidiaries within the IL&FS; group created a veil that concealed the real picture, Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas said timely intervention of the government prevented value destruction.
 "Broadly, if you look at, against the Rs 94,000 crore external debt (around Rs 73,000 crore secured and Rs 21,000 crore unsecured), we expect substantial recovery. Far more than the average 43 per cent recovery we have had from the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) so far," Srinivas told PTI.
 The NCLAT has approved the entire proposal of the government, which is in the "final stages of resolution".
 "We had hoped that bulk of the resolution would be over by August '20. But now due to COVID-19, that is likely to be delayed by a few months. The government has proposed a comprehensive resolution framework balancing stakeholders interests (banks, provident funds, pension funds and others)," the secretary said.
 According to him, recovery is being mentioned in terms of settlement of the external debt and involves multi-pronged strategies, including transfer of entity as a going concern, asset monetisation, creating InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) and debt restructuring.
 "The new board has done a good job. Of course, things will have to be expedited. We have to work against all odds and ensure that things are brought to a closure as soon as we can," he said.
 Around close to Rs 12,000 crore debt against completed road projects, where toll is being collected, is being converted into an InVIT. This means that there would be no haircut for banks because these are all operating entities with underlying cash-flows.
 "But there would be some compromise in terms of interest rate and duration. There can be early exit also once the secondary market develops," he noted.
 Reiterating that "the elephant" had gone amock in the IL&FS; case, Srinivas said it was strange that nobody saw it, whether it was statutory auditors, independent directors, credit rating agencies or others.
 "There is absolutely no doubt that the management was falsifying their financial position as well as performance with a view to inducing investments from mutual funds, pension funds and the ordinary and gullible investors... The SFIO has already submitted its report on IFIN and the report on ITNL is nearing completion," he said.
 As per the financial statements for FY19 finalised by the newly-appointed board, IL&FS; reported a staggering standalone net loss of around Rs 22,500 crore.
 "Around Rs 20,000 crore of so called intangible assets had to be written off, as they were nothing but falsely projected... The exercise of recasting the financial statements is also going on. Once done, it will make things totally clear," he added.
 On the issue of whether the statutory auditors were part of the conspiracy or not, Srinivas said the matter is subjudice.
 In terms of recovery in the IL&FS; matter, Orix took over the entire debt of around Rs 4,500 crore related to wind mills and gave around Rs 600 crore towards equity consideration.
 Education arm's entire loan amounting to around Rs 600 crore is being taken over by the successful bidder and small amount of equity consideration is also being offered. Similarly, in the case of GIFT City, the entire debt of Rs 12,00 crore is being taken over by the Gujarat government with equity value of Rs 32.5 crore for IL&FS;, Srinivas said.
 For five road assets having combined financial debt of Rs 9,500 crore, bids have been received and are undergoing approval process.
 "The Paradeep Refinery Water pipeline and Mangalore SEZ are under negotiation with ONGC. Similarly, the water project in Tamil Nadu is under negotiation with the Government of Tamil Nadu.
 "For the Stadium in Kerala the bidding process has been completed and negotiations are underway with the highest bidder. Over 40 plus solvent assets with combined debt of Rs 7,200 crore are servicing all obligations," Srinivas said.
 With respect to NHAI projects that remained incomplete due to the concessionaire's fault, it can terminate the contract without any compensation to the contractor.
 Following continuous engagement with NHAI, Srinivas said a new framework has been evolved under which NHAI has agreed for an independent audit to assess the amount invested in the project in order to give a fair compensation to the contractor in return of getting unencumbered physical possession of the assets, which can then be rebid.
 "This arrangement protects the value. Firstly, it is a public asset, which will now be completed through rebidding. Secondly, the outgoing contractor gets compensated on the basis on amount invested and current valuation of the assets in question. IL&FS; would be getting close to Rs 4,000 crore by virtue of this arrangement," he said.
 The thermal power plant at Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, is undergoing debt restructuring. This project is expected to get bids as the 1,200 MW facility is fully operational and the power purchase agreement is also intact.

These positive responses are to be welcomed – often they are sensible measures that should have been in place before – and ECRE urges other countries to follow suit. In addition, these initiatives need to be presented as or to be translated into permanent changes, for instance, via amnesties rather than temporary suspensions of negative measures (such as coercive Dublin transfers). Otherwise, people will find themselves with only temporary reprieve and an extension of the limbo in which they live. Second, some of these measures should serve as a catalyst for reasonable, long-overdue changes, such as expansion of employment rights for refugees or speeding up accreditation and recognition of training and qualifications granted outside Europe.

It is now clear that the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) will not just have huge costs in terms of loss of lives and public health, but lead to enormous economic suffering. The nature of the disease is such that there is an inherent tension between preserving lives -- which involves large scale lockdowns, restrictions on travel, and social distancing -- and economic activity -- which is based on mobility, migration, supply chains, trade, demand, and consumption. Governments across the world have intervened, in varying degrees, to minimise the distress. But what does the crisis, as well as the nature of the response, say about the new global economic paradigm? The welfare State is back. This is the most significant transformation in decades in global economic policymaking. To be sure, the welfare element of State policy -- even in the most developed capitalist democracies -- never faded entirely. But the dominant wisdom was that the State should stick to its core function of provision of basic public services and act as a regulator, and leave the rest to the market to determine. But it is clear that governments will now have to intervene in every element of economic life. For the poor, food and cash transfer will become a reality; for citizens across the board, free or subsidised health care will have to be contemplated; for the unemployed, allowances may have to instituted; for business and companies, fiscal support will have to be provided, tax concessions given, and demand created through public interventions; for the working class, public expenditure will have to be ramped up. The irony is that at a time when the world is dominated by Right-wing leaders, the economic argument of the global Left has prevailed. But this does not mean a return to the old ways of conducting economic transactions, for the other most significant change will be the enhanced role of technology. To be sure, technology advances were driving economic integration in unprecedented ways already. This is what made work-from-home possible. But expect an ever greater reliance now on technology, and a reduction of human interface, in the ways people live their lives, spend their money, work, operate businesses, interact with friends and family, and create communities. All of this accelerates the digital transformation, which, in turn, will be disruptive. Both the government and the private sector will be affected by this. It is this twin process, of welfarism and enhanced State role on one hand and of technological disruption on the other, which will dictate the post-pandemic order.

By no means am I suggesting people should start being irresponsible during the crisis. It's real and must be addressed by the people appropriately. For most, that means staying home and avoiding contact with others until the risks have subsided. But we must be cognizant of the laws, mandates, ordinances, and executive orders hitting us at the local, city, county, and state levels. That doesn't mean the federal government is off the hook, but they're much more in plain view. As counter-intuitive as it may seem, dealing with the federal government in this regard is going to be easier for once. But at lower levels of government, the power grabs are being made.

 Moscow suspended flights to Egypt after an Islamic State bomb brought down a Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board. The attack decimated Egypt’s vital tourism industry.
 Maxim Sokolov said in comments on Russian state television on Friday that Egypt and Russia have yet to sign a security protocol but added that direct flights between Moscow and Cairo should resume in early February.
 President Vladimir Putin on a visit to Cairo on Monday said the deal on the resumption of flights could be signed “in the nearest time.”

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysian authorities said they have arrested a boatload of 202 people believed to be minority Muslim Rohingya refugees after their boat was found adrift Sunday morning near the northern resort island of Langkawi. A Northern District maritime official, Capt. Zulinda Ramly, said the refugees included 152 men, 45 women and five children. She said some of the migrants told officials that the boat's skipper and two others, believed to be behind the smuggling syndicate, had escaped while they were at sea. Zulinda said maritime officials have taken precautionary measures to prevent any possible transmission of the COVID-19 virus while handling the group. The refugees were taken to the maritime office for further investigation before they are handed to the immigration department, she added. There were no further details on where the refugees came from. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh after a counterinsurgency campaign by Myanmar’s military in the western state of Rakhine in response to attacks in 2017 by a Rohingya insurgent group. Bangladesh now hosts more than a million Rohingya refugees, and traffickers usually lure refugees by promising them a better life overseas. Hundreds have been stopped by Bangladeshi coast guard officials trying to escape from one of the world's largest migrant camps. In February, 16 Rohingya refugees from a Bangladeshi migrant camp drowned after the overcrowded boat that was supposed to take them to Malaysia capsized in the Bay of Bengal. With more than a million refugees tightly packed in the camp, aid workers are also concerned about a possible outbreak of the coronavirus, although there are no confirmed cases yet. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya to be “Bengalis″ from Bangladesh even though many of their families...

For the entirety of their four years at West Henderson, they have filled the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Falcons' golf team, and though their backgrounds and approaches to the game of golf differ in many aspects, their love of the game and their bond off the course has remained constant.
   
 West seniors A.J. Shaffer and Wyatt Hughes first picked up a golf club about 10 years apart; Shaffer was 2 or 3 years old and continued from there, while Hughes' introduction to the game didn't come until he used his grandfather's clubs to try out for the Rugby Middle School team in seventh grade.
   
 "I barely made the team; I was using my granddad's old clubs for tryouts," Hughes recalled. "By the end of that year I was the two-seed from there."
   
 Shaffer, on the other hand, started at the top of Rugby's program after many years of joining his father and grandfather on the golf course.
   
 Both boys had played as many sports as they could, even being on the same rec league basketball team in sixth grade where they initially met. They also both decided to put down the baseball bat to play golf exclusively.
   
 "I came into middle school golf believing and knowing that I was going to win every tournament," Shaffer said. "(Wyatt) had never played golf until he went to tryouts and it was between him and another kid to make the last spot on the team. That was where it all started."
   
 Shaffer watched that season as his friend grew in skill and love of the game that Shaffer had loved for three-fourths of his life.
   
 Hughes took notes from his already experienced friend to help develop his own game.
   
 "A.J. definitely already had the resources to be a top player. We would go out and play at the course he was at; he taught me how to practice, and learning from example I would watch the way he did things, watch what he did to help me learn to be better," Hughes said.
   
 They bonded initially over a love for all things University of Tennessee and things took off from there.
   
 "We are literally best friends. Seventh grade year just being together around the golf team we found out we shared a lot of the same interests," Shaffer said. "(Wyatt) is a die-hard Tennessee fan and so am I, so we connected there. We both love being outdoors, we love playing sports. We really became tight our eighth grade year into ninth grade."
   
 For the last five years as both golfers have focused on golf year-round, they have had both a symbiotic and supportive relationship on the course with a competitive spirit at the heart of it.
   
 "The first day of practice in middle school (Wyatt) looked like a hacker; not like there was much potential there. But later on in the season I started to see him really love the game," Shaffer said. "The last few tournaments in seventh grade he put together some respectful scores, then started getting lessons and getting serious about it. He became quite the player eighth grade year and into high school."
   
 Each year since eighth grade Hughes has come out with the top score over Shaffer at least once, though Shaffer has remained the consistent top player year in and year out. His freshman year, Shaffer averaged a score of 75, then 71 both his sophomore and junior seasons. Last season Shaffer won all his Western Mountain Athletic Conference matches and was named the WMAC Golfer of the Year.
   
 Hughes also shaved his numbers down, as he averaged 79 his freshman year, 77 his sophomore season and 75 his junior year. He was named to the all-WMAC teams each season.
   
 As a team, West Henderson competed in just three nine-hole matches to start the 2020 spring sports season before athletic events were canceled and schools were shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
   
 The Falcons won all three matches as a team, and Shaffer won the top spot for two of the matches with scores of 34 for one-under par and then 35 for even par in the final match. Hughes shot two-over for a winning score of 37 in the second match.
   
 Although they are not able to participate in the team atmosphere at West this season, both Hughes and Shaffer are continuing to play golf within the social distancing guidelines and are hopeful that they will still get to compete in tournaments over the summer.
   
 Their senior season may have been cut short but Hughes's and Shaffer's futures in golf are secured. Their sights are set on different paths going forward as they look toward graduation, though their love of the game will remain.
   
 Shaffer, who has his sights set on one day playing in the PGA Tour, committed his junior year to play golf at UNC-Charlotte starting this fall, while Hughes has chosen to attend college for academics only and continue to play golf for fun.
   
 "I think I take a more casual approach to golf; I like to have fun. If I'm not having fun, it's not something I want to be doing," Hughes said. "I love to play golf and I've practiced every day for five or six years, and I will continue to play for the rest of my life."
   
 Their sights are set on different paths going forward as they look toward graduation, though their love of the game will remain, as will their friendship.
   
 "Wyatt has always been like family. If AJ was going to have a brother then it was going to be Wyatt," said Megan Shaffer, A.J.'s mother. "They love the same foods, they enjoy each other's company. They've made some good choices and have been good for each other and helped each other out in some tough situations and been there for each other. It's a proud mom moment to watch them from going into the middle school years until now getting ready to leave."
   
 "They are quite the duo."

While being in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, without access to gyms and sports clubs, may make it difficult for people to work out, researchers say that keeping up regular, daily exercise plays an important role in helping maintain a healthy immune system. The analysis, published in the international journal Exercise Immunology Review, assessed studies conducted over the last four decades that investigated how exercise affects the immune system. According to the researchers, including those from the University of Bach in the UK, regular moderate intensity exercise is beneficial for immunity. They said in the short term, exercise can help the immune system find and deal with pathogens, and in the long term, regular exercise slows down changes that happen to the immune system with ageing, therefore reducing the risk of infections.
