This one I'm not proud of, and I'm not here to defend. Yelling at my kids sucks. It makes them feel shitty and it makes me feel shitty. But it doesn't make me a bad mom. It makes me a human. On this point I really am trying to get better every day. Kids will test our patience to the max, and spending months and months together every second of every day has built a level of familiarity and comfort to behave a little douchey that anyone who's ever had a roommate knows all too well. What's a few extra dishes in the sink? Some dirty laundry on the floor? A temper tantrum or two? We're family, right? Yeah, yeah, kid. We're family. And because I'm comfortable with you, sometimes I think it's okay to yell. Seconds later, I'll regret it. So I promise to apologize and make a commitment to keep my voice down no matter how mad I get. If I learn how to do it, maybe you can, too.

Zia‚Äôs socio-economic, political, and cultural policies reflected the socio- economic, cultural, and political backgrounds of the majority members of the BNP‚Äôs executive committee, Zia‚Äôs cabinet and MPs from the ruling party. As mentioned earlier, he dropped the corrupt, and inefficient ‚ÄúSocialism‚Äù and lopsided ‚ÄúSecularism‚Äù, which being hyperbolic and symbolic, had turned the Mujib government dysfunctional, and the country a famine-stricken ‚Äúbasket case‚Äù. Zia introduced market economy and democracy, although he also stressed the role of the armed forces as the defenders of national sovereignty and thus, ensured some extra privileges to them. Nevertheless, Zia‚Äôs rule was a big departure from Mujib‚Äôs one-party Soviet-style ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù rule. He also promoted Islamic values and identity as integral to the national identity of Bangladesh. His growth and development strategy, and his rural development projects, and women‚Äôs empowerment programmes (he ensured ten percent or 30 reserved seats for women in the parliament, in addition to the 300 directly elected by the people) drew the attention of the UN, international donors, and development agencies, including the World Bank and IMF. Despite his government‚Äôs ‚Äúbias‚Äù toward promoting _jotedari_ (rich peasant/landlord) interests in the countryside, [25] his national, development, rural, and women‚Äôs empowerment policies, the promotion of liberal democracy and market economy, freedom of expression, and the rule of law, he was definitely the most statesman-like, honest, patriotic, pragmatic, innovative, and efficient ruler that Bangladesh have had in the last fifty years since 1971. No wonder, despite Mujib‚Äôs charisma, due to his ambivalence about the separation of East Pakistan from the state of Pakistan, his false claim about making the declaration of independence of Bangladesh on 26th March 1971, and above all, his corrupt, inefficient, and ruthless rule, Zia‚Äôs image outshines Mujib‚Äôs as that of a real hero of Bangladesh. His declaration of independence on 27th March 1971 on behalf of Mujib, while the latter had surrendered to the Pakistan Army, inspired Bengalis most, and gave them a sense of direction. Zia was definitely one of the founding fathers of Bangladesh, along with Mujib, Tajuddin, Osmani, and others.

  # Montana man accused of shooting has bail set at $50,000


  Associated Press


  BOZEMAN ‚Äî A Montana man is accused of stealing a cellphone and shooting at a group of people after arguing with them over their noise levels in West Yellowstone, just outside Yellowstone National Park.


  Brian Jones Marks, 47, faces a felony charge of robbery and three felony counts of assault with a weapon. Gallatin County Justice Court Judge Bryan Adams set his bail at $50,000, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported.


  In court on Tuesday, Marks‚Äô attorney George Isham asked for lower bail, to no avail. Marks did not enter a plea.


  The 47-year-old turned himself in Monday after the shooting led law enforcement on a weekend-long investigation.


  The victims say Marks approached their group of three and told them they needed to leave because they were being too loud last Saturday. One of the victims says they told Marks they were ‚Äúfrom here‚Äù and that he could leave. Marks cussed them out in response.


  Marks then went to his truck, grabbed a pistol and pointed it at the victims, they say. He told them to ‚Äúkeep talking‚Äù and fired rounds into the sand around the victims' feet, according to court documents compiled by the Daily Chronicle.


  Police said in the charging documents that the victims ran away to their cars as the man fired off more rounds of ammunition.


  One of the victims said she tried calling 911 once she was in her car, but that Marks opened the door, pulled her out and stole her cellphone. The car was in reverse and rolled backward, hitting the car the other two victims were in.


  Police say they found three shell casings and one spent slug at the scene of the crime. One of the victims told police that the man who shot at them left the scene in a silver Toyota truck with Texas license plates.


  The Gallatin County Sheriff's Office had issued a news release after the incident alerting the public that a man who was armed and dangerous was on the run in the area.


  There had been limited leads until Sunday, when law enforcement officials received a tip that led them to Marks. A detective used that tip to run Marks' name through a database, which found that he is the owner of a silver truck with Texas license plates.


  The incident drew law enforcement agents from Idaho, Montana, the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service.


  Isham said Marks is in the state to work over the summer and that he had previously been honorably discharged from the Marine Corps.


  Prosecutor Ashley Carroll said she was alarmed at Marks' behavior. ‚ÄúThere is a serious concern for the safety of the public there,‚Äù she said.


  Carroll said Marks was prohibited from possessing or buying guns at the time of the shooting.

In his first book of short stories, novelist and physician Daniel Mason delivers a collection of nine stories that capture extraordinary life experiences. With a range of characters and locales, each tale describes an achievement, an insight, or simply the ability to endure beyond what might have been thought possible.
 A master of descriptive prose, Mason structures many of the stories to complement the content. In an epistolary story, Celeste, an a√©ronaute (hot air balloonist) describes the mysterious phenomena she has observed in the upper atmosphere, which she calls ‚Äúa tear in the very fabric of the heavens.‚Äù But Celeste also chronicles the ridicule she receives from the men of the Acad√©mie when she attempts to share her observations. They do not deign to consider the scientific work of a woman.
 She pens the letter as she takes flight and, rising higher into the skies, she drops it over the edge of the basket, allowing the wind to handle the delivery like a message in a bottle tossed into the sea. Perhaps she trusts her scientific knowledge of the elements and is sure it will be delivered ‚Äì or perhaps it‚Äôs her last act before choosing to leave solid ground forever. Such choices, she admits, are beyond the scope of human consideration, suggesting the purview of the divine. ‚ÄúAlas, the one who knows the answer has kept it hidden.‚Äù
 In ‚ÄúDeath of the Pugilist, or The Famous Battle of Jacob Burke & Blindman McGraw,‚Äù Mason writes of a bare-knuckle boxing match between two fighters at pivotal points in their careers. He divides the story into brief chapters that evoke the quick rounds of the match. McGraw, the champion, is a Goliath of a man, though some speculate he is nearing the twilight of his career. Burke, the challenger, is a scrappy 21-year-old who has made a name for himself among the dockworkers of Bristol.
 Promotional posters plastered around town depict the event as a faceoff between two men, but in the imaginations of the townsfolk, the match has taken on gladiatorial proportions. As Burke enters the ring, he realizes he‚Äôs been offered up as a sacrifice. Even his trainer is in on the charade. With searing familiarity, he experiences the pain of the world once again telling him his life is inconsequential. Mason uses the ring as a metaphor for life, cycling through Burke‚Äôs thoughts about freedom and joy, sin and humiliation, each emotion landing with the speed and the blow of a well-placed punch.
 During one round, Burke recalls the philosophy of a former priest, who once asked him ‚ÄúHow are you going to win? Think, my boy. You want to win or you want to hurt him? Those are different things. ... [A]nger only takes a man so far.‚Äù
 Many of the stories are set in the 19th century, and Mason includes a few real-life historical figures. But many of the tales are imagined accounts of the anonymous figures who occupied the backgrounds of famous historical events.

As the summer heated up and infection rates went down, Massachusetts got footloose before it was COVID free. And now the state could be on the verge of paying for it.
 Gov. Charlie Baker, in his most scolding tone yet, rolled back outdoor gathering size limits from 100 people to 50, and said he was giving state and local police the authority to enforce those limits on public and private property. Indoors limits will remain at 25.
 "Hugs, handshakes, high-fives, dancing, who knows?" Baker said last week about what's been going on at these backyard parties and events that the governor blames for an uptick in COVID-19 cases and a rise in the state's positive test rate to 2.1 percent.
 The virus might not be out of the barn yet, but it's getting close to the door. And Baker said people have no one to blame but themselves for getting lax about the distancing and mask-wearing precautions they took seriously for months in order to be able to leave their homes this summer.
 "The biggest issue we have is people who are familiar with people being familiar with them, in big groups," Baker said.
 That's not the only problem though. The governor said he's not ready, as some have suggested he should be, to step back a phase in the reopening schedule. But he said bars "masquerading" as restaurants by selling potato chips and pretzels in order to open need to stop what they're doing.
 The state getting serious about enforcement is all so Massachusetts can avoid a repeat of this spring and becoming the next kid in the New England neighborhood to not get invited to the pool party. That distinction went this week to Rhode Island, where Gov. Gina Raimondo is battling her state's own resurgence because of too much partying.
 The Ocean State found itself added to the quarantine lists of not just Massachusetts, but also states like New York and New Jersey who want Rhode Islanders to quarantine if they leave their waterfront enclave.
 This precursor to a fall resurgence couldn't come at a worse time as schools are finalizing their plans to bring students back to classrooms and campuses around the state, or not. Business confidence also slipped in July, according to Associated Industries of Massachusetts, and enhanced unemployment benefits from the federal government have expired, eliminating a safety net as the recovery appears to be slowing.
 UMass Amherst reversed its plans to welcome students back to campus this month even if all their classes were going to be taught online, and some districts like Somerville are ignoring the administration's pleas to at least give in- person learning a chance.
 The Legislature has employed a hydrid model of in-person and remote participation during the pandemic, but in what was supposed to be the first full week of a five-month recess there wasn't much of either going on.
 The House and Senate made sure to give their negotiators every second available before the faux midnight deadline to strike a deal on police reform, transportation spending, telehealth or economic development. They did this knowing they had already extended the session, giving themselves ample more time.
 Seven days later and the Legislature was in the same place it was the previous Friday night - waiting.
 "We will let the conferees do their magic and hopefully get something done and pass it," Senate President Karen Spilka said at the start of the week. "If it's done next week, two weeks, that's when we will come back to do it."
 Instead of shrinking, the number of conference committees actually grew with a fifth piece of legislation dealing with climate change moving into talks between the branches.
 Sen. Michael Barrett and Rep. Thomas Golden, the co-chair of the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, are leading those talks, with support from Senate Majority Leader Cynthia Creem, Speaker Pro Tempore Patricia Haddad, House Minority Leader Brad Jones and Sen. Patrick O'Connor.
 It's the same group that negotiated a significant renewable energy bill two years ago, minus Sen. Marc Pacheco, who still chairs the Senate's Global Warming Committee, but has fallen out of the new leadership hierarchy and was replaced by Creem.
 Instead, Pacheco was relegated to cheering the House on from the sidelines of Twitter as that branch worked through and passed its version of the net-zero emissions bill that is now in final negotiations.
 The administration last week also did its part for global warming by rolling out a new clean peak standard that aims to encourage a reliance on renewable power sources to meet energy demand during peak hours, instead of falling back on dirtier fossil fuels like oil.
 Even though negotiations last week didn't yield any deals, those talks have to be going better than the discussions between Congressional Democrats and the White House over a new COVID-19 relief package.
 For starters, they're still going on, which can no longer be assured in Washington. But Democrats and Republicans can't get on the same page for an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits or the $500 billion in unrestricted relief money governors are requesting.
 The House passed a total package of $3 trillion already, while Republican leaders would reportedly like to get that down to $1 trillion. With the state budget's outlook riding in part on relief funds, the impasse makes Beacon Hill look somewhat prescient in pushing off its budgeting decisions for longer than just August.
 Baker finally put his signature on a three-month, $16.5 billion interim budget that leaders say will carry state government through October, but the governor rejected an Oct. 31 sunset on the authorization, and said the Legislature's attempts to impose minimum spending thresholds stepped on his toes at a time when he needed flexibility to manage through a pandemic and fiscal crisis.
 The bill sought to restrict Baker from spending less on any line item than either the fiscal 2020 budget or what the governor proposed in January in his House 2 budget.
 Leaders, however, have been silent since Baker sent that proposal back with an amendment in which he pledged to report to them if he finds ways to accomplish the same goals while spending less.

‚ÄúWe believe it is a good plan, and the bases have been covered,‚Äù Board Chairwoman Carol Jelaco said. ‚ÄúThat being said, a plan is only as good as its implementation.‚Äù
 Jelaco said her expectation is that the plan will be followed ‚Äúto the letter,‚Äù and that administrators and staff are to be examples in areas such as face coverings and maintaining as much distance as possible.
 Trustee Max Mickelson also stressed the importance of complying with all aspects of the plan. It is hard for people to understand the work Sweetwater No. 1 has done to prepare to open school and provide the best education on an individualized basis that is safe, he said.
 Mickelson said it is critical that the district‚Äôs schools are open for many reasons for students of every background, and that students, employees and the community need to work together.
 ‚ÄúThe true legacy of the West is looking out for each other,‚Äù he said.
 Regardless of what people may or may not believe about COVID-19, Mickelson said they should realize that the district has shown up and taken care of its students, staff and community in a spectacular way. He expressed the hope that people would pause for a minute in their bickering and appreciate what the district has done.
 Everyone needs to pull together so that the experience of starting school this year can be a positive one for families, students and employees, Mickelson said.
 Jelaco also emphasized working together for safety.
 ‚ÄúWe want our schools to be open, but we want them to be safe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of a worse scenario than for us to have a surge.‚Äù
 It is not a question of ‚Äúif,‚Äù but ‚Äúwhen‚Äù cases arise in the district, Jelaco said. When that happens, she said the district needs to work with local health officials to make sure cases are kept to a minimum.
 Trustee Stephanie Thompson said that as a parent, she has been having conversations with her kids to prepare them for what the new school year will look like. She suggested that other parents do the same.

‚ÄúHe can do it right now,‚Äù a smiling Hilton said, ‚Äúbut he can‚Äôt do it on the field.‚Äù


  Rhodes, a three-time Pro Bowler over seven seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, is still learning the house rules in his first year with the Indianapolis Colts. But he‚Äôs working feverishly to get up to speed.


  Just three seasons into a six-year, $78.1 million contract extension, the Vikings cut Rhodes in March. The move came after two injury riddled seasons during which the cornerback still recorded 110 combined tackles but managed to intercept just one pass in 29 games.


  His stay on the free agent market lasted just a little more than two weeks before he signed a one-year ‚Äúprove it‚Äù deal with the Colts reportedly worth $3 million. A connection with Indianapolis defensive backs coach Jonathan Gannon, who spent four seasons with Rhodes in Minnesota, factored heavily in the cornerback‚Äôs decision.


  Now the 30-year-old has a chance to prove he still has something left in the tank with a fresh start.


  ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre getting in Xavier is an ultra competitive player,‚Äù Gannon said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very prideful, like all our guys, but this guy carries himself a little bit different. I do think he has a little bit of a chip on his shoulder.‚Äù


  Rhodes often was asked to play on an island with the Vikings, matching up against the other team‚Äôs top wide receiver. He held his own well enough during the 2016 and 2017 seasons to make back-to-back Pro Bowl appearances while racking up seven of his 10 career interceptions.


  Rhodes figures to get more help in Indianapolis, where zone coverage is more prevalent. Gannon said the Colts also will work to simplify the cornerback‚Äôs role, allowing him to play faster and think less on the field.


  The scheme change has caused Rhodes to dig deeper into his playbook than he normally would in the offseason, but he‚Äôs very happy with what he‚Äôs seen so far.


  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs defense ‚Äì I mean, yeah (I like it),‚Äù Rhodes said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so much easier. I‚Äôll tell you that.‚Äù


  It‚Äôs also helped him to form fast bonds with his teammates through the opening weeks of training camp.


  Like all other NFL teams, Indianapolis‚Äô on-field work has thus far been limited to walk-throughs and individual practices where the offense and defense do not come together. The team will begin light practices in helmets and shoulder pads Wednesday and can begin full-padded sessions Monday.

Half a century after Americans landed men on the moon, a Black woman is the nominee for vice president, thus standing on the threshold of becoming president. As a measure of human progress, the first is to physics while the second is to social equality. Yet each is alike in the distance traveled and the obstacles overcome.
 Joe Biden vowed to name a woman as his running mate even before he emerged as the Democratic Party‚Äôs primary winner from the most diverse field of presidential candidates ‚Äì diverse in gender, ethnicity, generation, sexual orientation, and ideology. He had no shortage of prospects.
 In Kamala Harris he has chosen a governing partner with roots in social justice. Ms. Harris was raised in Oakland, California, by immigrant parents. Her father emigrated from Jamaica to study economics. Her mother arrived from India and became a medical scientist. They raised their daughters amid the civil rights movement in the Bay Area. Ms. Harris became the district attorney of San Francisco and then attorney general of California before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. Her selection reflects Mr. Biden‚Äôs promise to reduce incarceration and reform policing in response to the summer‚Äôs social justice protest movement.
 As an emblem of a Democratic establishment that is largely male, white, and older, Mr. Biden may be a transitional agent of change. He has billed himself as the bridge to a more inclusive era of politics that has already arrived in the party‚Äôs rank and file. The current Congress marks the fifth time in a row that the House and Senate became more diverse following an election. Women make up nearly a quarter of the membership in each chamber, the highest percentage in history. The speaker of the House is a woman. Roughly 13% of lawmakers are immigrants or children of immigrants.
 When Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman to be added to the ticket of a major political party in 1984, her candidacy was considered a novelty. Since then the political landscape has been transformed. Nearly half of all the women who have ever served in the House were elected since 1998. Across the Capitol‚Äôs Rotunda, 29 of the 56 women who have served in the Senate were elected in 2000 or later. Beyond Washington, 29% of all state legislators are women.

Stafford had been enjoying a fine season before the injuries caught up with him. He ended up with a career-best passer rating of 106 in the eight games he did play. When he was finally sidelined, it was the first time he‚Äôd missed any game since the 2010 season.
 ‚ÄúObviously last year with Matthew didn‚Äôt go the way we wanted it to go,‚Äù coach Matt Patricia said recently. ‚ÄúCertainly his drive, his competitiveness, I knew he‚Äôd be right back at it as soon as he could. Just keeping him healthy and making sure that he went into the offseason as safe as possible was important for us, and certainly through training camp as we go with him knowing the offseason was limited."
 There was already uncertainty about this NFL season ‚Äî and whether it could even be played ‚Äî when Stafford tested positive and went on COVID-IR.
 ‚ÄúI had no reason to not believe the results or whatever, except for the fact that I was feeling fine. But there's plenty of people out there that are positive and asymptomatic as well," he said. "There was no doubt there was some fear, as I think everybody would have if they got a test that came back positive. And just knowing how much that I'm around and have been around my family and my kids, that's a little bit of a scary thing.‚Äù
 Now, those fears have subsided a bit, and Stafford can focus more on the upcoming season.
 ‚ÄúI feel good. It's obviously exciting to get back in the building," Stafford said. "Not having an offseason, OTAs, and just being able to be around the guys, throw and catch ‚Äî all that kind of stuff is stuff you miss, so I'm happy to be back. I feel good, body feels good.‚Äù

Okay, this one does make me kind of an asshole, but I want to be honest with you. I am a big champion of the "sharing is caring" mantra, but I actually really suck at sharing myself. At least when it comes to food. While I will shamelessly take a bite of my kid's treats, when they start begging to have some of my meal, all bets are off. My reasoning here is, hey, I'm being pretty nice by getting you a treat, so the compromise is, you gotta let mama have a bite. The reason I don't share my food is because they have their own plate with the exact same food on it, just in a different configuration. Apparently, the food I serve my kids has been scooped out of the compost bin while mine has descended from the heavens, so they want to sample it like they're making a damn trip to Costco. Sorry, but no.

DETROIT (AP) ‚Äî Matthew Stafford says he didn't give much thought to opting out of this coming season.
 It would have been understandable if he'd considered it.
 ‚ÄúI think like everybody, you hear it and you talk with your spouse and your family about it. I never gave it serious, you know, thought,‚Äù Stafford said Tuesday. ‚ÄúI want to play football. I want to be out here. I have a supporting wife and family that know I love doing what I do and know it's important to me, so they were right on board.‚Äù
 Stafford and his family have dealt with their share of stress over the past couple of years. His wife had surgery last year to remove a brain tumor. Then Stafford went through football-related injuries that halted his 2019 season. His status was momentarily uncertain again recently when he was put on the reserve/COVID-19 list Aug. 1. He was removed three days later, with the Lions saying it was a false positive.
 Stafford's wife Kelly expressed her frustration on Instagram, suggesting that information such as that shouldn't be released until it's absolutely certain the person has COVID-19. Shortly after that, the NFL‚Äôs chief medical officer said the league was establishing a new protocol for positive tests.
 ‚ÄúIt's totally unknown times for all of us. The league, the players, coaches, the organization as a whole," Stafford said. "Everything is new and it's unknown. I know everybody's doing the best that they possibly can.‚Äù
 It's hard to blame Stafford and his family for being a little on edge. Kelly Stafford had surgery to remove a brain tumor in April 2019. Matthew Stafford's injuries later that year seemed trivial by comparison, but it was a tough season for the Detroit quarterback, who dealt with back and hip problems and missed the final eight games.

Other traditional Big Ten football powers ‚Äì Ohio State and Michigan ‚Äì expressed support for the commissioner‚Äôs decision. Ohio State made $104.3 million off tickets, parking and concessions for football games in 2018, while Michigan made $98.2 million.


  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre disappointed. We really are,‚Äù Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith said on BTN. ‚ÄúBut we certainly understand that this was the time that we had to pull the plug.‚Äù


  Said Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel: ‚ÄúThe Big Ten Conference made the unfortunate but necessary decision to postpone an athletic season in order to protect the health and well-being of our student-athletes, staff and community members. As a result, all fall sport schedules have been postponed. This latest decision was reached after careful consideration and the grim knowledge that this pandemic continues to affect our country adversely.‚Äù


  Iowa football coach Kirk Ferentz is hopeful the conference will remain unified behind Warren‚Äôs decision.


  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my 31st year in the conference,‚Äù Ferentz said. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons I‚Äôve been here 31 years, or at least involved in Big Ten play, (is) I have great respect for what the conference stands for. I think also, being in a conference, it‚Äôs important we‚Äôre together. ‚Ä¶


  ‚ÄúTo my knowledge, we have had no discussion about doing anything against what the conference decides, as much as we may want to. The conference has made a decision. We‚Äôre going to abide by that unless they reconsider.‚Äù


  Ferentz said there are concerns about the possibility of players choosing to transfer to other schools outside the conference in an effort to play somewhere else. The Pac-12 also decided to cancel fall sports Tuesday, but the ACC, SEC and Big 12 remain committed to playing this fall.


  ‚ÄúIt would be nice to see unity in college football, not raid each other‚Äôs rosters, block transfers, things of that nature,‚Äù Ferentz said. ‚ÄúAt least in the coming months, just until the landscape settles a little bit. That may be na√Øve in my thinking, but you would like to think everybody would just kind of be respectful of everybody‚Äôs positions right now and let everybody figure out what the path is as we move forward.‚Äù
