Yet there do seem to be situations in which a few individuals spark large outbreaks. With COVID-19, it is not yet known whether those highly infectious people include individuals with silent infections who do not realize they are sick, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and chief executive at Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies. More likely, he added, superspreading events may involve people with symptoms that linger but who are not sick enough to stay home.
 Or they could involve infected people who shed an unusual amount of virus — a poorly studied factor that might be due to variations in the amount of virus in the aerosol droplets from a patient’s cough or the amount of infectious virus in feces, for example.
 No matter what the cause, public health measures, like avoiding crowds and what Frieden calls cough hygiene, can prevent a superspreading event, he said.
 Medical history is replete with stories of superspreading in outbreaks of parasitic disease, tuberculosis, measles and other illness.
