Across the country, Democrats are largely abiding by health officials’ guidance, using the moment to model safe practices and signal respect for experts. Republicans are regularly flouting that caution, using it as a moment to celebrate what they view as personal freedom.
 In accepting the GOP’s renomination Thursday, President Donald Trump defied his own administration’s pandemic guidelines to speak for more than an hour to a tightly packed, largely maskless crowd. Vice President Mike Pence spoke to an unmasked convention audience that afterward crowded together to snap photos and shake the candidate’s hand. He obliged at least once.
 Similar scenes are playing out in other states. In North Carolina, the Republican candidate for governor, Dan Forest, has held so many big, indoor rallies and insisted on shaking hands so often that incumbent Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, put out a television ad featuring a doctor imploring Forest to “please stop.”
 The split extended to voting in Kansas’ primary earlier in August. Roughly two-thirds of Republicans voted in-person, while roughly two-thirds of Democrats used mail-in ballots.

Walmart may be the world’s largest retailer but it has mostly failed in its efforts to break Amazon’s online dominance.
 Could TikTok, a fast-growing 3-year-old app filled with goofy videos, be the answer?
 TikTok’s U.S. business appears up for grabs, with the Trump administration trying to force a sale, claiming national-security risks due to its Chinese owner, ByteDance. TikTok denies it is a risk and is suing to stop the administration from a threatened ban.
 Others have reportedly emerged, but the only confirmed suitors are Walmart, teaming with tech giant Microsoft.

During the pandemic, Corinne Lam and her stylist husband saw the income from their San Diego hair salon slashed by two-thirds while they struggled with unpaid medical bills and an uncertain future.
 Now, the 36-year-old said her phone is ringing off the hook and messages are popping up on social media asking for appointments as she prepares to reopen her doors. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday hair salons can resume operations, and she’s already booked out at least three weeks.
 “Every time we’re on the phone, we’re getting numerous calls coming in. My email is inundated,” Lam said.
 Salotto Salon is one of countless California businesses walloped by the whiplash of closings and reopenings and seemingly ever-changing guidance and rules about how to keep workers and customers safe from the coronavirus.
