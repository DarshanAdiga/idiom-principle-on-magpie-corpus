"It was a big deal for me when I was able to earn enough money just to buy the second-hand Mustang. I was broke when I finished racing. It actually cost me money to go racing and half the time I was out of pocket just trying to buy food. I was staying in crappy hotels. Now I have earned more than $1 million in less than a year."

There duly followed the cancellation/postponement of a raft of pantos. One of these, the King’s Theatre in Edinburgh’s Sleeping Beauty, has now become the watchword for an apparent Whitehall initiative to get things up and running in time for Christmas. At the weekend, Mr Dowden revealed that officials were working on “Operation Sleeping Beauty” to try and give the kiss of life to this crucial part of the theatre calendar. More details as to how he will perform this magic-wand transformation will (he says) be forthcoming, but it strikes me as a significant indication of Government resolve, where hitherto there had been a sense of worrying laissez-faire.

Construction on the Fourth Street Garage in downtown Bloomington is in full swing, with a large crane assisting with the work now soaring over the landscape.
 Work on the new structure began in mid July, and foundations and support columns have since been installed. Traffic on Walnut Street has been restricted to two lanes in the area, down from three, and additional impacts are expected in the coming months as contractors will be pouring the parking decks, which will entail a steady stream of concrete trucks.

The 48-year-old made much of the difference that match fitness will make to his side’s prospects in next month’s Euro2020 playoff semi-final in Slovakia.

As he acknowledged after the Finland game on Sunday, however, he largely has to hope for the best when it comes to his key players avoiding injury and getting game time over the coming weeks.

The Capital Wheel is open rain or shine, 365 days a year; and is always a perfect 72-degrees inside each private, climate-controlled gondola.
 “The Perfect Day” from True Respite Brewing was inspired by that vision of a perfect ride on The Capital Wheel and is being released today in follow up to the previous related brew in the series called It’s Too Foggy. The inspiration behind the name of the beer and the story on how they were developed tells the tale of a visit postponed and finally being fulfilled for the Brewery’s owner and family, the O’Leary’s.
 The story began around Father’s Day 2019 when brewery Co-Founders Brendan and Bailey O’Leary took their kids, Aidan and Aislinn to National Harbor to ride The Capital Wheel. When they arrived they found the harbor was too foggy for viewing sites and they didn’t take the ride; the kids were devastated. From then on, each time Brendan or Bailey said “no” to something Aislinn wanted, she would mutter to herself that “it’s too foggy.” That phrase came to represent her unique experiences dealing with disappointment and searching for understanding. Brendan and Bailey decided to name an Inner Circle Series beer after her and released It’s Too Foggy in fall 2019.
 National Harbor’s marketing team discovered the brew and story behind it and wanted to help fulfill Aslinn’s desire to experience that perfect day to ride The Capital Wheel. Fast forward to summer 2020, the O’Leary’s collaborated with National Harbor and The Capital Wheel to create a follow up brew to celebrate a perfect day riding The Capital Wheel at National Harbor. The Perfect Day brew is a Hazy DIPA (8.2%). “Riding The Capital Wheel is part of a perfect day of fun experiences guests can expect when visiting National Harbor, pair it with a tasty beverage, great dining and shopping and an overnight stay, makes for a fun Harborcation getaway” said Jackie Saunders, AVP marketing, National Harbor.
 The Capital Wheel is including the new brew in an experience package and is open daily with tickets available online. The Elevation Celebration Package feature includes 2 tickets for The Capital Wheel, 2 The Perfect Day Beers and 2 Souvenir Cups (other beverages available as well.)

The emphasis now is on accelerating reopening plans – with the backing of the Prime Minister – bringing the timetable forward. No one should understate the challenges of moving from phase four (socially distanced reopening) to phase five (full reopening) of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport’s road map. A lot of the protocols for making venues as Covid-safe as possible have been drawn up and implemented in venues like the Bridge and the Troubadour. But encouraging people to sit cheek by jowl carries obvious risks. And there are huge issues for the industry in terms of planning for full-scale events. How will insurance work, how do you incentivise investment, sort union deals?
