Perhaps sensing she was required to defend the ball’s feelings, the match referee Tatiana Woollaston approached Maflin to warn him that any more such gestures and he would forfeit a frame. As the event was taking place behind closed doors and there was no sound whatsoever coming from the auditorium, Woollaston thought it best to whisper her admonition. Maflin initially misheard what she said and thought she was merely telling him to tuck his shirt in. So she repeated her remarks, this time loud enough for the table side microphones to pick them up. Giving the white ball the bird was, it seems, not on.

The doctors’ body that had been vocal against the West Bengal government’s handling of the COVID-19 situation but is now partnering it in fighting the pandemic, has suggested a series of measures to unclog hospitals and boost the morale of healthcare workers.


  Coronavirus, August 3 updates


  The measures recommended by West Bengal Doctors’ Forum include creation of a dedicated facility for treating healthcare providers who test positive; cutting down on formalities (which include the long wait for approval from insurance companies) that delay the discharge of patients from hospitals; and forming of a uniform isolation protocol that will also help free beds.


  The recommendations came after a team of the Forum, which was recently invited by the State government to formally join its efforts, visited two hospitals and four isolation centres last week to make an assessment of the situation on the ground. The State, at the moment, is recording close to 3,000 cases a day.


  Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India


  “Ours is a fact-finding and not a fault-finding exercise. The fight against COVID-19 is going to be difficult but it is not impossible, provided we keep our heads cool,” said Dr. Kaushik Chaki, honorary secretary of the Forum, who was with the team.


  Setting up a dedicated facility to treat healthcare providers has been one of the Forum’s key demands from the beginning.


  “The mortality rate among healthcare workers is high, which is natural because their virus load is high. People who treat others cannot go running around for a bed when they are infected. The government should immediately create level-3 and level-4 facilities for them. Besides, we have also recommended breaking down their shifts into shorter durations. It is extremely difficult for them to work for 12 hours at a stretch wearing PPE suits,” Dr. Chaki said.


  State-wise tracker for coronavirus cases, deaths and testing rates


  According to him, the Forum has also called for a uniform isolation protocol. At the moment, patients being treated in a hospital are usually discharged after 10 days and asked to remain in self-isolation for another seven days, whereas those admitted in a ‘safe home’ (isolation centre) with mild symptoms are required to spend 14 days in the facility and another seven days in self- isolation.


  Also, quite often, outgoing patients, out of personal choice or compulsion, prefer to spend the last seven days of isolation at the hospital instead of home; each such patient thus blocks a bed for a week. “Such patients should be sent to safe homes,” Dr. Chaki said.


  The Forum also recommended increased digital monitoring of patients’ vitals in hospitals as well as safe homes so that it decreases the burden on the nursing staff who have to manually record readings periodically. It also suggested installation of centralised alarm systems that will alert medical staff in case a monitor shows unusual readings.

It all makes for a toxic cocktail, one that in my case took loving, supportive parents and turned them into grim-faced strangers overnight. It also led to a disastrous engagement in 2006, marked by emotional abuse — the ending of which required mining my deepest reserves of courage. Still, it was a turning point for me with regard to the system: I was able to sit across the table from my parents and tell them, “Enough.” And for every woman like me who can stand up and defy an arranged marriage, there are many who can’t, for reasons beyond their control — beginning with economic hardships.


  Irked by the memes and jokes that started appearing about “Indian Matchmaking” within days of its premiere, I started a Twitter thread detailing my experiences in the system. I have since been inundated with messages from women across cultures and countries sharing their experiences.


  Perhaps they felt compelled to reach out exactly _because_ “Indian Matchmaking” isn’t interested in answering tough questions about the arranged marriage system. It will not show you how Akshay called off the engagement, besieged by doubts — or what his former fiancée felt about it. At the end of the day, it’s a reality show where excesses are amplified to evoke a reaction from the viewer. Our collective clamoring to find out if any of the participants ended up with the partners we last saw them with is simply an indication of society’s obsession with happily ever afters, no matter the route we take to arrive at it. But beyond the glossy facade lies real heartbreak — and memes, jokes and binge-watches shouldn’t cloud our sight of that.

  After Kumaresan handed over the sacrificial bird and animal to Krana Rajan, the puja started on Sunday night in Parvathi’s house. A pit was dug in the bedroom and the rooster was sacrificed. Krana Rajan then took the cat from a gunny bag, but it escaped. The _tantrik_ told Kumaresan to bring one of his two sons to be sacrificed to get the treasure.


  Since Kumaresan, who was under the influence of alcohol, was unable to take a decision, Krana Rajan tried to snatch the two-year-old boy from Kumaresan’s wife, who managed to run out of the house with both children. As she screamed for help, neighbours rushed to the spot. They thrashed Krana Rajan and handed him to Kalakkad police, who also picked up Kumaresan and Parvathi for interrogation.

El fiscal regional de Rosario, Patricio Serjal, le presentó la renuncia a su cargo como cabeza del Ministerio Público de la Acusación (MPA) en la ciudad de Rosario al fiscal general de la provincia, Jorge Baclini, quien esta mañana le aceptará la dimisión.      La decisión sobrevino tras la resonante investigación sobre corrupción que lo involucra a él junto con el fiscal de Flagrancia Gustavo Ponce Asahad sobre cobertura institucional a un capitalista de juego ilegal, que salió a la luz a raíz de una trama de extorsiones que se atribuyen a la banda de Los Monos.      "Soy ajeno a las cuestiones que se han ventilado y me he puesto a disposición de los investigadores para lo que los mismos requieran. Quiero dejar en claro que jamás he realizado actos que no se hayan ajustado a derecho durante mi función, hago referencia a mi actuación, desconociendo el modo en que san obrado otras personas y no siendo quién para juzgarlas", dice Serjal en la misiva que le elevó al fiscal general.      Serjal y Ponce Asahad fueron denunciados por un capitalista del juego que tiene negocios ilegales en la provincia en una audiencia penal en la que se lo imputó. Allí dijo que ambos funcionarios del MPA le exigían entregas de dinero para brindarle cierto nivel de protección par que pudiera seguir delinquiendo.      El escándalo comenzó hace algunos días pero estalló el viernes, con la declaración de este empresario. En principio los fiscales que lo investigan pensaban que sólo salpicarían a Ponce Asahad, a quien ese día la Tropa de Operaciones Especiales le allanó su domicilio, le demoró y le abrió causa penal, pero inesperadamente también mencionaron a Serjal, que es el jefe de los fiscales rosarinos.      Un dato a tener en cuenta es que la renuncia de Serjal es al cargo de la jefatura de la Fiscalía Regional Rosario, pero no a su condición de fiscal de grado.      En ese sentido, la Asociación de Fiscales emitió un comunicado en el que expresa que debe renunciar también como fiscal. "Nosotros pensamos que no tiene la idoneidad moral para ocupar el cargo que ocupa", dijo Sebastián Narvaja, tesorero y miembro de la comisión directiva de esa asociación, que ayer emitió un duro comunicado para expresarse sobre el caso.

“If a movement is not 100% inclusive, then it's going to fail,” he said. “That's the first rule of thumb in all progressive spaces, is that if you aren't centering disability justice in everything, then it's ultimately going to fail because you've already started out your movement with exclusion.”


  This can be a hard lesson in the “go, go, go” urgent world of activism, Taylor said. But he said, “folks have to remember that whether or not somebody identifies as disabled politically, there are going to be disabled people in your space, no matter what you do.” What kind of environment will people come into? One that prioritizes their gifts and contributions or one that leaves them behind?


  The lessons that disability justice teaches, Taylor said, of inclusion, care and addressing the root of unjust systems, can make things better for the whole society.


  "I would like to see disability justice be a part of not only dismantling systems," he said, "but being building blocks to create a better and more sustainable world."

Dorian Taylor, a Tacoma paralegal at Lavender Rights Project and a disability justice advocate, says the way he sees it, disability rights and the ADA might have opened important doors, but they fall short in terms of addressing the intersecting ways people with disabilities are marginalized.


  Taylor said where disability rights end, disability justice begins.


  The concept of disability justice was born out of work by activists — disabled, mostly queer, people of color — in the early 2000s. They sought to prioritize the leadership of people with disabilities who experienced multiple forms of oppression stemming from racism, sexual orientation, gender identity, immigration status, incarceration status and other identities.


  As an example, the school-to-prison pipeline affects students of color, many of whom also have disabilities. Traditionally, the disability rights movement has seen it primarily as a race issue, whereas the disability justice movement would contend it’s more accurately a disability issue, too.


  Part of the work of disability justice, Taylor said, is flipping our approach upside down and normalizing and prioritizing access needs for everyone. Taylor said if society had modeled itself around the need for ramps instead of stairs, for example, he wouldn’t be disabled as a wheelchair user.


  “


  My needs aren’t special. Framing them as special needs makes them seem like privileges. It makes it appear that you're doing something special for somebody when you're not, you're just giving them access.   — Dorian Taylor


  “My needs aren’t special,” Taylor said. “Framing them as special needs makes them seem like privileges. It makes it appear that you're doing something special for somebody when you're not, you're just giving them access. You're allowing them to do the same things that everybody else is doing. But framing access in that way puts the burden on the person who needs that access.”


  What if every job asked every person if they had access needs and helped to meet them? What if every school asked every student? What if it were just a normal part of our daily processes?

The process has moved at a remarkable clip. Two vaccine candidates, one developed by Moderna in conjunction with Fauci’s institute and another by Pfizer, last week began Phase 3 trials, the final stage of clinical experimentation. Others are expected soon.In Azar’s conference room at the Department of Health and Human Services headquarters, Kushner and Birx join meetings with Azar, Esper and others. Kushner repeatedly pushes the group to move faster and has deputized two close associates, Brad Smith and Adam Boehler, to press the case.


  The team has sought to ensure that a variety of different types of potential vaccines are being pursued to increase the chances that at least one will work. Birx has been interested in what is known as a subunit protein vaccine, and at one point called executives at biotechnology company Genentech and asked what they could do. (Warp Speed is now working with two companies pursuing that type of vaccine.)


  Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, also talks with pharmaceutical executives. People briefed on the discussions say the White House has also pushed for progress by the fall on therapeutics — drugs to treat people who fall ill to the disease — including the possibility of an emergency use authorization for one or more of those drugs. Late last month, Trump called the chief executive of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to check on the progress of a potential antibody treatment.


  Career officials have assured Hahn that they would stand behind him to head off any vaccine decision not based on science. But Hahn already lost a measure of credibility with the scientific community for approving the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two anti-malaria drugs promoted by the president as treatments for the coronavirus over the objections of his public health advisers. The FDA later revoked the authorization, concluding the risks outweighed the benefits.


  Scientists have argued that it would be unwise to cut corners on a vaccine that is to be injected into some 300 million Americans, adding that a failed effort would fuel public distrust of vaccines generally.

  The recommendations came after a team of the Forum, which was recently invited by the State government to formally join its efforts, visited two hospitals and four isolation centres last week to make an assessment of the situation on the ground. The State, at the moment, is recording close to 3,000 cases a day.

  “Ours is a fact-finding and not a fault-finding exercise. The fight against COVID-19 is going to be difficult but it is not impossible, provided we keep our heads cool,” said Dr. Kaushik Chaki, honorary secretary of the Forum, who was with the team.


  Setting up a dedicated facility to treat healthcare providers has been one of the Forum’s key demands from the beginning.


  “The mortality rate among healthcare workers is high, which is natural because their virus load is high. People who treat others cannot go running around for a bed when they are infected. The government should immediately create level-3 and level-4 facilities for them. Besides, we have also recommended breaking down their shifts into shorter durations. It is extremely difficult for them to work for 12 hours at a stretch wearing PPE suits,” Dr. Chaki said.


  State-wise tracker for coronavirus cases, deaths and testing rates


  According to him, the Forum has also called for a uniform isolation protocol. At the moment, patients being treated in a hospital are usually discharged after 10 days and asked to remain in self-isolation for another seven days, whereas those admitted in a ‘safe home’ (isolation centre) with mild symptoms are required to spend 14 days in the facility and another seven days in self- isolation.


  Also, quite often, outgoing patients, out of personal choice or compulsion, prefer to spend the last seven days of isolation at the hospital instead of home; each such patient thus blocks a bed for a week. “Such patients should be sent to safe homes,” Dr. Chaki said.


  The Forum also recommended increased digital monitoring of patients’ vitals in hospitals as well as safe homes so that it decreases the burden on the nursing staff who have to manually record readings periodically. It also suggested installation of centralised alarm systems that will alert medical staff in case a monitor shows unusual readings.

Authorities closed beaches, parks and virus testing sites, lashing signs to palm trees so they wouldn’t blow away. Officials wrestled with how to prepare shelters where people can seek refuge from the storm if necessary while safely social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.


  Isaias put another burden on communities already hit by other storms and sickness.


  In Palm Beach County, about 150 people were in shelters, emergency management spokeswoman Lisa De La Rionda said.


  “We don’t anticipate many more evacuations,” she said, adding that the evacuees are physically distant from each other and are wearing masks.


  In Indian River County, north of West Palm Beach, emergency shelters were clearing out Sunday after Isaias was downgraded to a tropical storm.


  Officials told TCPalm newspapers that 38 people registered at three schools used as shelters. Those areas now must be cleaned to ensure no traces of the coronavirus remain as teachers and staff report today to prepare for the upcoming school year.


  No one checked in with COVID-19 symptoms. Temperature checks were done at the door, officials said, and isolation rooms were designated in case anyone came in with symptoms.


  The storm’s maximum sustained winds declined steadily throughout Saturday, and were at 65 mph at 11 a.m. Sunday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.


  Fluctuations in the storm’s strength are possible into Tuesday, forecasters said.


  Isaias already has caused destruction in the Caribbean: On Thursday, before it became a hurricane, it uprooted trees, destroyed crops and homes and caused widespread flooding and small landslides in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. One man died in the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, the National Guard rescued at least 35 people from floods that swept away one woman, whose body was recovered Saturday.


  Isaias snapped trees and knocked out power as it blew through the Bahamas on Saturday.


  Meanwhile, officials in the Bahamas opened shelters for people in Abaco island to help those who have been living in temporary structures since Dorian devastated the area, killing at least 70 people in September 2019.

  The union's Hart praised WSF's program, and said the culture of COVID prevention is gaining support. Esther Bryant Kyles, a Seattle-based ticket agent, died in March after contracting the coronavirus.


  For now, workers feel stressed while the depleted ferry network operates "on the verge of failure every day," Hart said.


  Though 56% of passengers have returned since the March lockdowns, WSF says it's short 100 employees because many are choosing to stay home to avoid exposure to the virus or take care of family members. Many routes provide only one boat; at noon Friday the Edmonds-Kingston waits reached three hours.


  Ferry and union officials reached agreement to let many workers defer this summer's vacations to beef up the number of Coast Guard-qualified staff and keep boats sailing, Hart said.


  Rolfes said nine deckhand trainees just graduated and 10 more will complete training in August, bolstering ferry staff. Ferry management also is contacting employees on leave to see how they be brought back to work safely, she said.

  In a typical good year of business, the outdoor complex entertains around 1million guests.


  However, the UK's state-sanctioned lockdown on March 23, forced it to close its doors and issue refunds to thousands of visitors.


  On July 4, it began a phased reopening, which was followed by thrill rides including Maelstrom, Shockwave and Apocalypse on July 18.

Investors are buying in. Vroom's shares are now trading at more than double their US$22 launch price on June 8. Carvana's market value is near that of No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co , though it has yet to post a profit.


  In a sign of the times, an April survey by CarGurus Inc , an online marketplace for new and used cars, found 61per cent of people shopping for cars were open to buying online. That compares with 32per cent before the pandemic.


  Selling vehicles online with no physical showrooms requires more than just a nifty app though.


  The US$2 billion Carvana has spent since 2013 rolling out its digital network has included payments for technology to evaluate trade-in vehicles, financing for car loans, switching car titles across U.S. states with different rules and a logistics network to recondition, store and deliver thousands of vehicles to customers' homes.


  "It's expensive to build up an entirely new supply chain that's nationwide and supports tens of thousands of cars," Garcia said.


  Rival Vroom has spent around US$1 billion on its online platform and inventory so far. It hopes some day to also use the platform to sell auto parts or insurance, or to serve as a marketplace for smaller auto retailers, CEO Paul Hennessey said.


  Vroom could provide smaller dealers with reconditioning services, logistics and a vast pool of potential car buyers - for a fee.


  Shift's Russell, meanwhile, also hopes to host other dealer's vehicles on his company's platform.


  The three main online sellers say they have no interest in new car sales because they are unprofitable and dealer franchise laws make selling across state lines difficult. Of the automakers, only Tesla Inc has avoided franchises and always sold vehicles online.


  CarMax , the No. 1 used car retail chain, has spent


  over US$300 million rolling out a digital platform to accompany its 200 U.S. stores. It is still working through the logistics of serving America's vast geography.


  "It's not for the faint-hearted," said CarMax Chief Marketing Officer Jim Lyski.


  Lyski and other executives say other major brick-and-mortar auto retail chains will likely roll out online sales, but the huge investments involved will limit digital competition.


  "I think the largest players are the only ones that can actually afford to build that capability," Lyski said.


  Industry experts say Amazon.com Inc , which provides auto research for consumers but does not sell cars, has a huge potential in online vehicle sales. But the e-commerce titan, which has seen its profit surge during the pandemic, declined to comment.


  "This isn't something we'd speculate on," said Amazon spokeswoman Lori Torgerson.


  CHALLENGE FROM DEALERS


  CarMax launched "contactless" curbside pickup during the pandemic, a popular choice for online customers. It also offers free home delivery up to 60 miles (97 km) from a dealership, a service to available to most customers.


  But home delivery is cost-prohibitive in some areas, or state regulations prevent it, CarMax said.


  CarMax's Des Moines store, for instance, does not offer home delivery, though general manager Brandon Parram said some customers have asked about it.


  "I know it takes time to figure out how to make it work," Parram said, "but I'm a fan of any new way to give customers the options they want."


  Major automakers have been pushing for more online new vehicle sales, especially after COVID-19 shuttered many dealerships.


  In April, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) launched online shopping tools allowing U.S. customers to buy a vehicle through a franchise dealer.


  But automakers face a big potential challenge from dealers, a powerful lobbying group. Laws restrict direct online sales by auto manufacturers in some parts of the country with franchised dealers.


  "The automakers built this system and they have to live with it," said Peter Bible, a former executive at General Motors Co . "They are trying to turn a battleship on a dime and it just doesn't work that way."

They say you never forget your first time.


  I was in the middle of an editorial meeting at the newspaper I worked for in 2005 when it came out of nowhere: an overwhelming sense of fear, the trembling hands, the absolute certainty that my heart was going to burst out of my chest. Even today, I can hear the cacophony of the newsroom around me as I gathered that no, I wasn’t dying. It would be years before I understood that what I had experienced that day — and would on three subsequent occasions — was a panic attack.


  I was 24, and just two hours before, my parents had called to ask me to be home on time that night. They wanted to discuss a “match” with me.


  So I greeted the arrival of Netflix’s “Indian Matchmaking” last month with a half-raised eyebrow and a smirk. I had no intention of watching it. I had been there, done that, gotten the T-shirt and made a bonfire from it.

"The big three (auto) e-commerce players will grow substantially, but it will be hard to be a new entrant," said Toby Russell, joint chief executive officer of Shift, which will go public to join rival Carvana and Vroom later this quarter.

  Online sales still only account for around 1per cent of the roughly US$840 billion Americans spend annually on around 40 million used cars. But after numerous U.S. states went into COVID-19 lockdowns in March, the advantage of socially-distant online sales has come squarely into focus.

On July 24, Secretary of Health John Weisman extended the original governor's order to require that people wear masks when outside their home anywhere in the state, where they are within 6 feet of non-household members, even outdoors.


  State proclamations say "violators may be subject to enforcement" pursuant to state codes. The listed misdemeanor penalty is $25 to $100, or up to 90 days in jail.


  "But we cannot arrest them, and we cannot throw them off the boat," ferry spokesman Ian Sterling said. "You can't make them walk the plank."


  Sterling said it would probably take verbal threats or a physical altercation by a passenger for a ferry crew to request law enforcement to meet the boat at the arrival dock. That hasn't occurred in mask dispute, to his knowledge. Conceivably, if a passenger defies the mask mandate "as a political statement" a crew might call police, who would choose whether to respond, he said.

The initial signs are encouraging for City, who have maintained all along that they do not blame Uefa as a body, which implies that they feel there has been an agenda against them from factions within.


  There is a feeling that they feel the “clear and organised attempt” to damage their reputation – a claim to which City have stuck throughout this tawdry episode – had tendrils within Uefa as well as in Football Leaks, although City have never shone a light on that claim.


  Whoever drove the investigation, the fact is they are smarting from a pretty complete defeat.


  And there are forces within Uefa who want to put it behind them and move forward. It makes sense for the governing body to now stop banging heads with City, accept them more fully into the fold as one of the clubs which enhance the Champions League’s attractiveness rather than rule-breaking rowdies who are spoiling the party.

Kalakkad police have nabbed three persons, including a _tantrik_ (black magician), for allegedly attempting to offer human sacrifice to retrieve buried treasure.


  Krana Rajan, 55, of Dohnavur near Kalakkad approached Parvathi, 70, of Sadaiyamaankulam and told her that she would get treasure worth several crores of rupees lying under her house if she could sacrifice a rooster and a black cat after performing special puja in her house. She agreed to it and Krana Rajan reportedly took ₹2 lakh from her in several installments to perform the puja.


  When Parvathi passed on the information to her foster son Kumaresan, he too was lured by the promise of the _tantrik_.


  After Kumaresan handed over the sacrificial bird and animal to Krana Rajan, the puja started on Sunday night in Parvathi’s house. A pit was dug in the bedroom and the rooster was sacrificed. Krana Rajan then took the cat from a gunny bag, but it escaped. The _tantrik_ told Kumaresan to bring one of his two sons to be sacrificed to get the treasure.


  Since Kumaresan, who was under the influence of alcohol, was unable to take a decision, Krana Rajan tried to snatch the two-year-old boy from Kumaresan’s wife, who managed to run out of the house with both children. As she screamed for help, neighbours rushed to the spot. They thrashed Krana Rajan and handed him to Kalakkad police, who also picked up Kumaresan and Parvathi for interrogation.


  Further investigations are on.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Going shopping was a top priority for Taylor Jenkins when he was first hired as coach of the Memphis Grizzlies.


  The man needed suits.


  NBA sidelines tend to look like fashion runways these days, with coaches in tailored suits, sharp ties and polished dress shoes, so Jenkins went out and bought appropriately for his first chance at being a head coach. But at the restart of the season at Walt Disney World, the dress code has been relaxed to allow polos, slacks, even sneakers — and coaches are thankful.


  Jenkins is among them, though he notes that spending spree doesn’t help him much now.


  “I spent quite a bit of money picking out my wardrobe, first-time head coach, so I’ve invested quite a bit there to quote-unquote look good on the sidelines,” Jenkins said.


  At least he’ll be saving on dry cleaning for the foreseeable future.


  By league rule, male “coaches and assistant coaches must wear a sport coat or suit coat” during games. That rule, however, was ditched for the restart, where there are no fans in the stands and games are played at the Walt Disney World resort near Orlando — where midday temperatures exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.22 degrees Celsius) are not uncommon at this time of the year.


  Coaches are mixing it up: short-sleeved polos, long-sleeved polos, some in team colors, some in bright colors. When Toronto beat the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night, Raptors coach Nick Nurse was wearing a thin hoodie with a message printed on the front encouraging people to vote.


  “I love it,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “I hope that someday we adopt these dress code rules. Although I look very good in a suit and tie, I will admit, I’m also very, very comfortable wearing a Nuggets polo and a pair of TravisMathew athletic leisure wear pants. I think I’ve done a very good job with the look.”


  The looks for football coaches is all over the map; some over the years have worn coats and ties, while New England’s Bill Belichick seems most comfortable in a hoodie with the sleeves mostly cut off. Baseball managers are in uniforms — the pants, anyway; not all wear jerseys.


  In the NBA, the dress code got ramped up considerably thanks to Miami Heat president Pat Riley and the late Chuck Daly. Riley, when he coached, roamed the sideline in snazzy Armani; Daly’s suits were Hugo Boss, and his shoes were so good that his friends coveted them. After Daly died, Rollie Massimino raided his friend’s shoe collection and wore them for the remainder of his own coaching career.


  Riley is still among the sharpest of dressers, and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra is not afraid to follow in those footsteps with his own wardrobe. But for this trip, Spoelstra didn’t pack a single tie.


  He’s not afraid to say that he wouldn’t mind if this became a permanent switch.


  “It takes a little bit more thought when you have to wear suits,” said Spoelstra, who is coaching at Disney in black shirts, black slacks, black dress socks and upscale black sneakers. “I can speak for our coaching staff — we’ve enjoyed it.”


  Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers didn’t bring any suits but said after a scrimmage at Disney last month that he’d wear one if and only if his team was in Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Boston coach Brad Stevens has even skipped wearing ties in regular circumstances, so he wouldn’t figure to have an issue with the polos-and-khakis look.


  “I don’t know why we still wear suits,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said last summer, when he was coaching USA Basketball’s team at the World Cup in China. “Somebody, please, tell me why we do that.”


  Popovich wore polos, sneakers and sweats to coach in that tournament and raved about the comfort level. He repeated the refrain a few times earlier this season, and the Disney dress code is right in line with what he’d like to see happen when “normalcy” returns.


  Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan, when he was coaching the Florida Gators, was mandated to arrive in a suit and tie. The suit jacket, however, rarely was still on for tipoff — and, as one might expect, he’s part of the chorus of coaches raving about needing to wear only polos these days.


  “Ask all coaches,” Donovan said. “What we’re dressing in is pretty comfortable.”

Race plays a role in how vulnerable people are because of institutional racism, Fay added, which is something providers doing external fills understand.
 Fay still worried that people with major behavioral health conditions were being left behind. He was optimistic, though, that the system set up during COVID-19 pointed to a way forward.
 “This interim process shows that we can quite quickly create something better than what we have," Fay said. "Maybe we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Maybe we just need to tap the expertise of our local providers."
 ## "Fighting over scraps"
 This summer, the county’s policy advisory committee on homelessness has decided to continue relying on more external fills to get people into housing quickly. They continue to watch the data to see whether to keep the new system going.
 Some are cautious about calling the recent change a victory. At a recent meeting, Wayne Wilson, community impact manager on homelessness at the United Way of King County, pointed out that the root of the problem, to him, was the system's overall lack of housing.
 "Until we get that volume up, we're always going to be fighting over scraps," Wilson said at the July 23 meeting. “To me the volume is the real crux of our problem.”

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Justin Thomas wants to make his second stint as No. 1 in the world last longer than the first time around.


  “I hope so,” Thomas said Sunday after winning the FedEx St. Jude Invitational to take the No. 1 spot for the first time since June 2018. “I feel like I’m a better player, and I feel like I’m more complete of a golfer now than I was then.”


  Thomas dueled defending champion Brooks Koepka down the final holes, sealing the World Golf Championship victory on the par-5 16th. Thomas took the lead for good with his second straight birdie, while Koepka bogeyed the hole.


  Koepka pulled within a stroke with a 39-footer for birdie on No. 17. But Koepka put his tee shot into the water along the 18th fairway on his way to double bogey, allowing Thomas to finish up an easy par putt for what wound up a three-stroke victory.


  Thomas closed with a 5-under 66 to finish at 13-under 267 and take the $10.5 million winner’s check for his 13th PGA Tour title. At 27, he became the third-youngest player since 1960 to reach 13 PGA Tour wins, trailing only Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus.


  “I’ve been fortunate to have a good career so far, but I plan on playing out here for a long time and have a lot of things that I still want to accomplish,” Thomas said. “And every milestone and stepping stone is hopefully something that I can learn from.”


  and something that will help me even more in the long run.”


  One sign of Thomas’ growth was this was the fifth time he rallied to win, and he matched his biggest comeback after starting the day four strokes back of third-round leader Brendon Todd. Thomas has three wins this season, two since the start of the year.


  The last time Thomas was No. 1, he spent four weeks at the top of the ranking. He will supplant Jon Rahm, who became No. 1 after winning at Memorial two weeks ago and tied for 52nd this week.


  Koepka will go to TPC Harding Park in San Francisco looking to defend his PGA championship title, and he said he’s feeling good about how he’s playing. He finished with a 69 and tied for second with Phil Mickelson (67), Daniel Berger (65) and Tom Lewis (66).


  “I thought I hit a good chip on 16,” Koepka said. “I don’t know what it did. Then another minute I thought it was in for another second. So to make bogey there was disappointing. Obviously drained a big one on 17, and then you’re down one. You’ve got to take an aggressive line on 18, so it is what it is.”


  Thomas had Jim “Bones” Mackay on his bag, playing in the same group with Mickelson for the first time since Mickelson split with his longtime caddie. Mackay was a late fill-in for Thomas’ usual caddie, Jimmy Johnson.


  “I feel like he knows enough about my game to where he can contribute and be a help, and he was,” Thomas said about Mackay.


  Thomas made up the deficit with four birdies on the front nine and just missed another birdie chance on No. 8. His 20-footer on No. 9 tied Todd at 12 under.


  Todd, whose putting had carried him through the first three rounds, three- putted for bogey from 23 feet on the par-3 eighth, leaving Thomas alone atop the leaderboard.


  Thomas put his second on the par-4 12th into a greenside bunker near the back edge and chopped it out to the rough. He chipped out from an awkward stance to salvage bogey.


  That created a five-way tie at 11 under with Koepka, Berger, Lewis and Todd.


  Koepka took the lead to himself on the par-4 13th. He hit his approach from 133 yards to 10 feet of the pin, and Koepka sunk the putt for his third birdie of the round to go to 12 under.


  After hitting his tee shot 321 yards to the rough 51 yards short of the hole on No. 15, Thomas hit to 6 feet for a birdie, tying Koepka at 12 under with three to play. Thomas found the rough far right of the cart path on the par-5 16th, then hit his third from the left rough 65 yards to 3 feet for his second straight birdie.


  Koepka, in the group behind Thomas, tried to answer 42 yards from the hole. His shot landed close to the hole only to keep rolling to the back of the green. Koepka wound up two-putting from 8 feet for bogey.


  Finishing on No. 18, Thomas made sure to avoid any danger before Koepka’s final birdie.


  “I saw that I had a two-shot lead, hence the reason I hit it right of the universe,” Thomas said of a tee shot that went right of the cart path. “It was not going left, I promise you that.”

Should the US fire a missile at most places in the Soviet Union, it would be almost certain to hit its target, but any retaliation by Moscow would likely strike its target in America, too. Keeping both sides relatively weak, then, was meant to prompt the countries to think twice before launching any missiles, and perhaps persuade them to stop developing more offensive capabilities.

  Bell said she is encouraged by the “robust” number of independent films and studio movies that applied for incentives in the latest round, which closed July 15 and is being reviewed by the commission. Local film offices, meanwhile, are seeing upticks in permit applications.


  “Production is definitely picking up in the state,” Bell said. “There is definitely a collective will and desire to get productions up and running.”


  Officials are hopeful that productions such as “In Treatment,” which employ relatively small numbers of cast and crew, will have an easier time getting back in business. The new season of “In Treatment” is expected to have a hired cast of eight and a crew of 125, according to the commission.

 Homeless-service providers in King County have long criticized the housing tool as one that favors white applicants. A study published last year by human services consultancy C4 Innovations found that being white predicted higher vulnerability scores in King County.
 The study found that people of color who were homeless were much less likely than white people to say they were facing certain challenges — for example, on questions that asked whether substance use led them to be kicked out of housing. That meant their vulnerability scores — key to getting housing — were going to be lower.

NAPLES, Fla., August 3, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Keller Williams Naples (KW Naples) is expanding its presence in Southwest Florida with an alliance with brokerage firm Caine Premier Properties.


  Keller Williams (KW), the world's largest real estate technology franchise by agent count, units sold and volume, gains significant market share in the Naples marketplace with the KW-Caine alliance.

When you're at the cusp of making a GPU purchase decision, it's easy to blindly stare at the performance figures and use that as the only metric. However, there are other factors that you have to consider, which include reliability. For a long time now, AMD has never quite had the same reliability rating as Nvidia, but a lot of it was based off gut feelings or anecdote's from individuals with good or bad experiences. Now, Mindfactory has published its RMA data for Nvidia Turing GPUs and AMD's 5000 series, and it's bad news for AMD, as spotted by redditor Oottzz.


  Mindfactory is one of the bigger hardware retailers in Germany, and they sell much the same hardware as we have in the U.S. The data it gathered comprises Nvidia cards from the 1660 Ti and above, with AMD's data includes the 5500 XT and above. The full list is available here.


  In total, the data set covers 44,100 AMD cards sold and an impressive 76,280 Nvidia GPU, so it is clear that German buyers prefer Nvidia GPUs. From these figures, Nvidia has a total number of GPUs RMA'd of 1607 units, and AMD a total of 1452 units -- which translates to a 3.3% RMA rate for AMD and a 2.1% RMA rate for Nvidia cards, making AMD cards roughly 50 percent more prone to failure.


  However, it's also interesting to look across the product stack and see where the failures happen. Nvidia line is quite consistent throughout, but in AMD stack it's clear that the 5500 XT cards hardly fail at all, while the RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT cards fail most with a 3.6% failure rate, which isn't great compared to the RTX 2070 Super's impressive 1 percent RMA rate. Jump to an RTX 2080 Ti though, and you're looking at  a painful 5.3% RMA rate.


  Of course, it's important to mention that these numbers alone still don't tell the whole story. Many Redditors rightly point out that AMD did have problems with the drivers early on with the RX 5700 series releases, which might explain why the RX 5500 XT has a lower RMA rate, as it came out later when AMD had more time to refine its drivers.


  Meanwhile, it's also not specified why the different cards were RMA'd. For example, I have an RTX 2070 Super from Gigabyte in my system that has a broken fan bearing on its WindForce cooler that I still need to RMA, but this could just as well have happened on the AMD variant of the card as the coolers come out of the same factory -- but we can likely presume that those kinds of minor defects occur at similar rates between Nvidia and AMD cards.


  At the end of the day, the best thing you can do as a consumer is look at reviews, including customer reviews of the card you intend to buy -- a lot of negative feedback is a simple red flag to watch out for. If you're buying at the release of a new product when there aren't many customer reviews yet, well then you're probably aware that you're taking a higher risk to begin with.
