Tarr's proposal would require the devices for first-time offenders whose blood alcohol content at the time of arrest is .15% or more.
 Similar proposals have passed the Senate in recent years, usually to stall in the House.
 Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, which lobbies for tougher drunken driving laws, support's Tarr's proposal.
 Mary Kate DePamphilis, the group's New England director, said requiring the devices for all offenses of driving under the influence will "allow convicted drunk drivers to learn how to drive sober and be part of society while taking drunk drivers off the road."
 Massachusetts’ drunken driving penalties are already considered strict.
 In 2005, lawmakers passed Melanie's Law, billed as the toughest in the nation, setting mandatory sentences for drunken drivers and requiring new penalties such as vehicle ignition locks for repeat offenders.
 The law was named after Melanie Powell, a 13-year-old Marshfield girl killed in 2003 by a woman who had been driving drunk despite a previous offense.
 Even with its tough laws, the state has seen an uptick in fatal crashes involving drunken drivers.
 "Drunk driving is responsible for roughly a third of all roadway fatalities across the nation," said Mary Maguire, AAA's spokeswoman for the Northeast, which also support's Tarr' proposal. "It's remains a potent killer, and that's why requiring interlock devices for all offenders is so critically important."

 Ukrainian tennis player Stanislav Poplavskyy has been given a lifetime ban for participating in match-fixing activities, the Tennis Integrity Unit said Friday.
 The TIU said Poplavskyy took part in match-fixing and "courtsiding" activities on multiple occasions between 2015 and 2019.
 Courtsiding involves transmission of live scoring data from a match to a third party for betting purposes and is prohibited.
 Poplavskyy, who had a highest ATP ranking of 440, also facilitated courtsiding and failed "to report multiple approaches asking him to contrive matches," the TIU said.
 Poplavskyy, who was also fined $10,000, "accepted all charges" against him.

Massachusetts now requires the devices for repeat offenders but is the only state that doesn't require ignition interlocks for first-time offenders.
 Tarr said research from other states show the devices substantially reduce drunken driving cases.
 "We’re talking about making sure the first-time offenders don’t have the opportunity to drive drunk a second time and put lives at risk," he said.
 An ignition interlock is similar to a Breathalyzer used by police, but the device is connected to a vehicle's ignition system. A driver must blow into a tube on the device, which checks for the presence of alcohol, before starting the vehicle.
 If the device detects alcohol, the vehicle won't start.
 In Massachusetts, courts require the devices for offenders whose blood alcohol level was .08%, the state limit, or higher during a second drunken driving offense.
 Offenders pay to install the devices, as well as a leasing charge that can run more than $80 per month.
