BROCKWAY — The Fifth Annual Frank Varischetti All-Star football game has been postponed to Aug. 7, at Frank Varischetti Field in Brockway.
 The game was originally scheduled for Friday, June 26. Rosters have not been announced.
 Game Manager Nick Hoffman said, “Our decision combines our desire to play the game and honor the outstanding scholar-athletes who have been selected to play and our commitment to do so in the most safe and responsible way possible in light of the Covid-19 situation.
 “We hope playing the game at a later date means players along with their families, friends and fans will have the opportunity for a much-needed respite,” Hoffman said.
 The Frank Varischetti All-Star game features graduated seniors from 21 schools in District 9 representing the former Allegheny Mountain League and the Keystone Shortly Athletic Conference.
 Game Sponsors fund $1,000 scholarships that will be awarded to a number of players at halftime.
 The old AML schools include Bradford, Brockway, Cameron County, Coudersport, Curwensville, Elk County Catholic, Kane, Otto-Eldred, Port Allegany, Ridgway, Sheffield and Smethport.
 The old KSAC schools include Brookville, Clarion, Karns City, Keystone, Moniteau, Punxsutawney, Redbank Valley, St. Marys Area and Union/AC Valley.

In Holland, Belgium and now France the season is over. They’ve finally accepted the things they cannot change. Germany has seen a resurgence this week in the number of cases after a relaxation of the lockdown. A decision on the Bundesliga could be made on Thursday.
 Why is Britain’s Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, fuelling talk of a restart? Especially when only last week the government’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, braced the country for months more of social distancing? So much for following the science.
 Games behind closed doors has been a crazy idea from the start.
 Go back even further and the idea that players would forego the pre-match handshake to protect them from the virus - only to engage in 90 minutes of physical contact followed by shirt swapping at the end - was laughable.
 Footballers aren’t robots. Wayne Rooney, Arsenal’s Matteo Guendouzi, West Ham’s Aaron Cresswell and Leyton Orient’s Jobi McAnuff are among a string of stars who have openly expressed their fears of infecting their families by playing.

All three had admitted robbery and possession of a weapon.
 Rebanne Cantrill, 19, of Brigham Street, Openshaw, Manchester, was sentenced to 14 years.
 Devon Patterson, 21, of Stan Jolley Walk, also in Openshaw, was jailed for 10 and a half years.
 And John McLeod, 19, of Back Haslam Street, Bury, was given eight and a half years.
 Speaking after the sentencing Detective Sergeant Simon Mills, of Macclesfield CID, said: “The offenders subjected the victims to a terrifying ordeal, holding them at knifepoint in their own home and threatening them with claw hammers.
 “They even assaulted the victims’ 12 month old dog with a hammer in an attempt to get the family to hand over their possessions and life savings – a truly despicable action and luckily the young dog did not sustain any serious injuries.
 “I am delighted that the trio have all received a substantial custodial sentence and I hope that this brings some closure to the victims.”

For golf enthusiasts and course owners around the area, Monday’s announcement from Harrisburg likely brought a huge sigh of surprising relief.
 Governor Tom Wolf announced that some restrictions on businesses related to certain outdoor activities were being lifted starting Friday, including golf courses.
 As long as they follow updated life-sustaining business guidelines, courses can resume business. That was great news, and somewhat surprising considering that May 8 was the likely earliest time that anything was going to be opened up.
 “(With the poor April weather), we didn’t miss much in April. But there’s a pent up demand right now for golf,” Pinecrest Country Club President Mark Powell said. “And just to do something, and with the governor opening things up on Friday, I think we’re going to see an increase in interest. And if you have mowed your grass once, you know that once you do it once it starts growing and it’s growing out there and it’s green, and it looks fantastic.”
 Powell said to call Andy Martino at the Pro Shop (849-4666) to make a tee time reservation. He said that the clubhouse will remain closed and the course will follow all of the guidelines to line up with social distancing parameters as we get through the current coronovirus pandemic conditions.
 “We’ll follow all of the CDC guidelines handed down to a T and we’ll sanitize all the carts between rounds with the one occupant per cart if they want to use one,” Powell said. “Otherwise we’ll need to enforce the six feet apart rule with social distancing.

London, Apr 29 (AFP) Manchester United have been granted permission to install 1,500 safe-standing seats for use in a trial when Old Trafford is opened again to supporters.
 The use of barrier seating has been approved following a change in regulations and a feasibility study carried out by the club.
 Fans are not expected to be permitted to attend matches for at least a number of months with English football indefinitely suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Even when matches do return, they will likely take place behind closed doors for the forseeable future.
 However, United insist work can be carried out on the project whilst respecting social distancing guidelines to ensure it is ready for when fans can return.
 "It may seem strange to talk about stadium plans at this time, but football and our fans will return when it is safe, and our preparations for that must continue in the background," said United's managing director Richard Arnold.
 "This announcement is the latest step in what has been a long journey with our fans.
 "We have listened to their feedback, in particular, the representations made by MUST (Manchester United Supporters' Trust), and worked with Trafford Council to develop and approve this proposal."
 Arnold added that the barrier seats can enhance spectator safety in areas of the ground where fans persistently stand anyway and that the trial could be extended to other areas of the stadium.
 "We will now move on to develop the installation, compliance and licensing plan for the trial, with a view to having the new seats installed for when we can welcome our supporters back to Old Trafford," said Arnold.
 All-seater stadiums have been mandatory in the top two tiers of English football since 1994/95, following recommendations on stadium safety made in the Taylor Report, which was commissioned after 96 people died in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.
 But there has been a renewed push in recent years for safe standing to be brought into the top levels of English football with United set to follow fellow Premier League clubs Tottenham and Wolves in installing rail seating. AFP

 There is no suggestion that next season will be played behind closed doors, but the general consensus is that the opening games will at least be shut off from the public.
 Matchday proceeds equate to almost a quarter of the club's total revenue over a season.

HARRISBURG — The extension of cabin-fever brought on by the coronavirus blues has hunters across Pennsylvania looking forward to the start of spring turkey season.
 Hunting turkeys in Penn’s Woods will be different this year because of COVID-19, particularly during the youth spring turkey hunt on April 25. But Gov. Tom Wolf’s travel restrictions allow for turkey hunting as outdoor recreation.
 But that clearance doesn’t relinquish our obligation to families, friends and all Pennsylvanians to follow the social-distancing and stop-the-spread protocols that are helping the Commonwealth reverse -COVID-19’s hold on the Keystone State.
 Some simple rules can make all turkey hunting safer. One of the easiest to follow is: If you live together you can hunt together. When you live in the same home as someone, there’s relatively no risk of spreading COVID-19, so long as no one in the home has it. If someone does, everyone in the home is expected to self-quarantine for two weeks.
 Consider carefully whether you should mentor any hunter this spring turkey season. If Pennsylvanians are lucky, the state will be coming off COVID-19’s apex. But stopping the spread remains as important as ever. No turkey hunt is worth the risk of contracting COVID-19.
 If you’re going, think of the problems that must be resolved to hunt turkeys safely while mentoring a friend or mentee. Hunting in a blind is out; it doesn’t meet social-distancing requirement to be at least 6 feet apart.
 If you can hunt close to home, here are precautions all mentor and mentee turkey hunters should follow. Follow social-distancing rules and wear gloves at all times. Use a camouflaged bandana or gaiter to cover your nose and mouth. Any equipment passed from one hunter to another should have been cleaned thoroughly before starting the hunt. Carry hand sanitizer for cleanups afield. Coordinate with pre-arranged hand signals.
