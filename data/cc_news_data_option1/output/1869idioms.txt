Amazon is giving its Fire HD 8 tablet a significant overhaul, including a much-needed visual refresh. The new Fire HD 8, Fire HD 8 Plus and Fire HD 8 Kids Edition still pack 8-inch 1,280 x 800 screens, but in a slicker-looking design -- the bezels aren't nearly as thick as they were in the past. They also share faster 2GHz quad-core MediaTek 8168 chips that are reportedly 30 percent faster, at least 32GB of storage and (finally!) USB-C.The base Fire HD 8 and its Kids Edition counterpart won't be spectacular with its 2GB of RAM, 2-megapixel front and rear cameras and 12 hours of claimed battery life. The real star this time around is the Fire HD 8 Plus. On top of 3GB of RAM and faster wired charging (through a 9W adapter), it also supports wireless charging if you have a compatible dock or similar device. Amazon envisions using it as an Alexa-powered smart display like the Echo Show, but it could also be useful if you'd just like to quickly grab the tablet when you're reading a book. You can pre-order the updated Fire HD 8 for $90 ahead of its June 3rd release, while the HD 8 Plus arrives the same day for $110. Bundle a Made for Amazon dock from ANGREAT and it'll cost you $140. The Kids Edition costs the same $140, but it includes the customary kid-ready case, a year of FreeTime Unlimited and a two-year "worry-free guarantee." These new Amazon slates aren't revolutionary, but they might do the trick if you like the size and only want a few frills. Amazon

Europe is slowly moving towards some form of normality. However, the EU is walking a tightrope in its attempts to frame a unified approach in the 27 member states. John Downing explains. Is there any chance that I can go on a holiday this summer?When the coronavirus crash-landed upon everyone the EU was slow, disunited and confused in its response. The gradual – and risky – return to normality can show similar confusion and disunity in reverse. That is what the policy-guiding Commission is determined to avoid.Brussels has now set out plans for a phased restart to some level of travel this summer. Tourism accounts for 10pc of EU states&rsquo; economic output and one in eight jobs. It&rsquo;s not just about dreams of sunshine – millions of jobs are on the line and the 2020 season cannot be entirely written off.What is the extent of damage to the tourism industry across Europe?Travel restrictions to combat the virus have already had a devastating impact on the sector. Airlines around the continent have been forced to shed tens of thousands of jobs and some are on the brink of closure.Tourism is vital to southern EU countries already struggling with debt and the impact of coronavirus – notably Greece, Italy and Spain.The world&rsquo;s biggest tourism group, TUI, has announced it will cut 8,000 jobs due to losses of €750m in the first three months of 2020.Are individual countries – including Ireland – working on their own roadmaps to unwind their various lockdowns?Yes. Decisions about reopening borders are the responsibility of national governments. But this time Brussels is urging the 27 EU states to take a coordinated approach to unwinding lockdowns.They do not want a repeat of what happened at the start of this crisis, when capitals just closed frontiers with little or no consultation.How long until travel returns to the way it was pre- coronavirus?The EU is proposing a three-stage approach, starting with the current situation in which most travel across borders is banned and, in reality, almost non-existent.In phase one, the EU wants border restrictions lifted between countries and regions which are at a similar stage of the pandemic, and where the health situation is improving.In the final phase, all coronavirus-related border controls would be lifted and travel permitted throughout Europe once again. But health precautions would continue within each member state in consultation with the EU.Is the EU in a rush to open up borders?The EU wants governments to factor in economic and social factors, as well as the health of the public, as they decide on reopening their borders. They recognise that the annual summer holiday is cherished by tens of millions of European families.&ldquo;This is not going to be a normal summer. But, when we all do our part, we don&rsquo;t have to face a summer stuck at home or completely lost for the tourism industry,&rdquo; EU Commission vice-president, Margrethe Vestager, summed up.What will it look like to travel in the new normal?There must be measures in place to minimise the risk of infection. Travellers should wear face masks while on planes, trains and buses. The same applies at travel hubs such as airports and railway stations.Fewer passengers may be allowed on board to allow them to maintain safe distancing, and buffet trolleys and dining cars will be shuttered.Hotels and restaurants will be urged to limit guest numbers so they can respect social-distancing rules.EU countries are asked to voluntarily agree to ensure contact-tracing phone apps work across borders. This is to keep a close eye on the progress of the disease and quickly identify any hotspots.

Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s former presidential campaign chairman who was convicted as part of the special counsel’s Russia investigation, has been released from federal prison to serve the rest of his sentence in home confinement due to concerns about coronavirus, his lawyer said. The 71-year-old was released from FCI Loretto, a low-security prison in Pennsylvania, according to his lawyer Todd Blanche.Manafort had been serving more than seven years in prison following his conviction. His lawyers had asked the Bureau of Prisons to release him to home confinement, arguing that he was at high risk from coronavirus because of his age and pre-existing medical conditions. Manafort was admitted to hospital in December after suffering from a heart-related condition, sources said at the time.Manafort was among the first people charged in special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s Russia investigation, which examined possible co-ordination between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election campaign.Manafort, who was prosecuted in two federal courts, was convicted by a jury in Virginia in 2018 and later pleaded guilty in Washington.He was sentenced last March and was immediately hit with state charges in New York that could put him outside the president&rsquo;s power to pardon. New York prosecutors have accused him of giving false information on a mortgage loan application. Manafort&rsquo;s release comes as prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak. They argue that the public health guidance to stay 6ft away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.Attorney general William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons in March and April to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. There are no confirmed coronavirus cases at FCI Loretto.As of Tuesday, 2,818 federal inmates and 262 BOP staff members had positive test results for Covid-19 at federal prisons across the country. Fifty inmates had died.The bureau has given contradictory and confusing guidance on how it is deciding who is released to home confinement, changing requirements, setting up inmates for release and backing off and refusing to explain how it decides who gets out and when.An agency spokeswoman said more than 2,400 inmates have been moved to home confinement since March 26, when Mr Barr first issued a home confinement memo, and more than 1,200 others have been approved and are in the pipeline to be released.

With that money the government can feed all the poor in the country for months and strongly impose lockdown even if they have to resort to a temporary martial law. Problem is that the government does not have the will. All they are interested is in looting the country.

Jaguar Health Inc. (JAGX) shares on Tuesday's trading session, jumped 6.15 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $0.57 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of -$18.04 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post -$0.46 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -311.40% and predicted to reach at 88.90% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 40.00% for the next five year.

Apple launched HomeKit Secure Video last year, designed to help protect the privacy of home surveillance systems. All well and good for those concerned about the security of the footage their systems capture, but not so much for those that want their pick of tech, since few third-party cameras support the platform. Now though, Logitech -- a major and well- respected name -- has launched a top-line security camera that exclusively supports Apple's HomeKit Secure Video.  The Circle View camera comes with full 1080 HD and 180-degree diagonal field-of-view glass optics, which means more detail in sunlight or shadows. And it's got infrared night vision up to 15 feet. For a camera designed especially for a security platform, however, its front-end privacy features are pretty basic. If you want to disable audio or video you'll have to manually press a button on the camera, or tilt it down to change its view. Not really a problem if you've got it positioned on a shelf inside, but if it is outdoors (and it is weatherproof, so it could be), that could be more of an effort. Nonetheless, it looks smart and comes with all the stuff you need right out of the box, such as wall mounting hardware and a generous 10-foot power cable. And it's a reasonable price, too -- at $160 it's certainly not the cheapest security camera on the market, but it ­is Logitech, and it is designed exclusively for the usually hard-to-buy-for HomeKit Secure Video platform. As such, you'll need the relevant Apple gear to support it, such as an iPhone or iPad, plus a supported iCloud plan to store activity history. It goes on sale later this month, available direct from Logitech and Apple.
