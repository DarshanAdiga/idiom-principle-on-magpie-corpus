Philippine aviation officials on Monday grounded all aircraft belonging to a company that owns a plane that caught fire while taking off from Manila’s airport, killing all eight people on board.                                  All of Lionair Inc.’s aircraft will remain grounded during the investigation of the burning of its Westwind 24 plane late Sunday, they said. The plane had been used earlier to transport medical supplies for the coronavirus outbreak.                                  Lionair, a Philippine-based charter company, is not related to Lion Air, an Indonesian low-cost airline.                                  The twin-engine aircraft was on a medical evacuation mission when it caught fire. The two passengers — from the U.S. and Canada — and six Filipino flight crew and medical personnel died when the Tokyo-bound plane burst into flames on the main runway, airport general manager Ed Monreal said.

 ASSAULT/HARASSMENT
 Police heard differing accounts of an incident Thursday afternoon at Interstate 759 and Black Creek Parkway. A 36-year-old man called police and said he was fixing his girlfriend's vehicle on the side of the road when a couple pulled up and the man shoved him against the vehicle, as the man and woman accused him of stealing something from them. He told police he ran and jumped across the fence into the median. He said the man chased him with his Jeep and at some point, the woman hit him in the back of the head. Medics were called to check the knot on the back of his head, but found no marks. Officers were called to the couple's home to make a report on an alleged assault. The 37-year-old woman told police she and her husband were driving on I-759 and saw the vehicle broken down on the side of the road. They stopped to offer assistance, then saw who the person with the vehicle was -- a man they say had stolen from them in the past. They decided to go and help him anyway, but when the man went to get tools, the alleged former thief punched her in the arm. Officers noted she had a slight red mark on her arm. She told police they did not retaliate, even though they wanted to. She said they got in their car and left.

BANGKOK (AP) — World markets started the week with fresh losses as countries reported surging numbers of infections from the coronavirus that are forcing shutdowns of travel and business in many regions.Shares fell in London, Paris and Tokyo but surged 7% in Australia after the government promised more recession-fighting stimulus."We want to keep the engine of our economy running through this crisis," Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra. His unprecedented $130 billion package includes wage subsidies of up to $1,500 per two weeks to businesses to keep workers on the job.U.S. futures yoyo'd throughout Asia's day but turned lower. The future for the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6% while that for the Dow industrials lost 0.8%. Oil prices were lower.Hopes that a $2 trillion U.S. relief bill would ease the economic havoc brought by the pandemic did little to alleviate the gloom prevailing in many markets.On Monday, Germany's DAX was flat at 9,634.00 while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.1% to 4,304.63. Britain's FTSE 100 declined 1.7% to 5,415.26.The pandemic relief bill approved by the Congress and signed Friday by President Donald Trump includes direct payments to households, aid to hard-hit industries like airlines and support for small businesses. Analysts expect markets to remain turbulent, however, until the outbreak begins to wane."Sentiment once again took a turn for the worse going into a week of reckoning by means of economic fundamentals," Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. "The rally seen for Wall Street last week may amount to little more but a relief rally with sentiment turning sour once again going into a fresh week."The push to deliver financial relief has gained urgency worldwide as the outbreak widens. The number of cases in the U.S. has now surpassed those in China and Italy, climbing to more than 142,000 known cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. The worldwide total has topped 723,000, and the death toll has topped 34,000, while nearly 152,000 have recovered.On Monday, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 1.6% to 19,084.97, while the Kospi in South Korea was flat at 1,717.12. The Shanghai Composite shed 0.9% to 2,747.21, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 1.3% to 23,175.11.Shares fell in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. India's Sensex fell 4.2% to 28,524.43.Some investors have emerged to hunt for bargains as prices kept falling, said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities in Hong Kong.He views it as a bit too early."I think whatever rally you see, is really a false rally, it will be only a flash in the pan. It's only temporary. Don't go bottom fishing just yet because the worst is still to come," Lun said.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.The damage from the pandemic to corporate profits, the ultimate driver of stock prices, remains uncertain.But energy companies are suffering as the price of oil sinks. U.S. benchmark crude dropped 5.4% or $1.16 to $20.35 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It slid 4.8% to close at $21.51 a barrel on Friday. Goldman Sachs has forecast that it will fall well below $20 a barrel in the next two months because storage will be filled to the brim and wells will have to be shut in.Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 6% or $1.67 to $26.28 per barrel.The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.64% from 0.68% late Friday. Lower yields reflect dimmer expectations for economic growth and greater demand for low-risk assets.In currency trading, the dollar was at 107.57 Japanese yen, down from 107.94 late Friday. The euro weakened to $1.1094 from $1.1142.___Associated Press writer Alice Fung in Hong Kong contributed.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Quality stocks have also been derated. In case collection conditions normalise, specialist franchise like Bandhan could be interesting for the long-term investors, it said.For those facing difficulty in selecting banking stocks should look at the ones with a combination of deep funding, high provision coverage, limited issues in asset quality and strong capital ratios, suggests JP Morgan.However, large exposures in real estate/mid corporate sector should be best avoided given asset quality landmines there, according to the brokerage.Furthermore, it has cut price targets and EPS across the board, however 3 banking stocks that look good despite price cuts are HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.The investment bank also suggested &quot;to find out the best banking stocks in the sector, one can go by track recording companies over past down cycles, and look for the ones that managed headwinds like 2008 financial crisis, 2013 taper tantrum, 2016 demonetisation and 2018 liquidity problems&quot;.The report also highlighted that lower growth across the sector will continue till June and a return to normalcy will not be anytime before FY22.

Manchester United are linked with a move to sign Juventus midfielder Aaron Ramsey this summer, with the Welsh international having left Arsenal only 12 months ago.                  Ramsey joined our club at the tender age of 17, having showcased his talents in the Cardiff senior side, and went onto make 262 Premier League appearances for our side, knocking in 40 goals in the process.                  The 29 year-old refused to sign a contract extension in North London last season, and was frozen out initially by Unai Emery, but realised later in the campaign just how important he was as Ramsey fought his way back into the starting XI, before departing for Juventus on a free-transfer.                  Rambo has since been playing as a squad player in Serie A, and looks likely to pick up his first league title of his career, should the season be completed of course. Juve sit top of Serie A, one point ahead of rivals Lazio, and remain on course to win their ninth top division title in a row.                  The Welsh midfield wizard is now being eyed as a potential makeweight in a deal that could see Paul Pogba return to Turin, having failed to find the consistency needed since returning to Man United.                  It remains to be seen whether Ramsey would be willing to leave Juve so early into his spell there, nor whether he would be willing to leave in order to join the Red Devils, especially given our long-running rivalry.                  After 11 years with Arsenal, I would hope that a player that forced his way out of the club to leave for another country, wouldn’t be so quick to return with a rival, especially given United are currently very much in the same position as Arsenal.                   One could argue that Mikel Arteta’s early stint puts us as a more attractive prospect to play for next season, while United losing United a player of Pogba’s stature will hamper their progression.                  Would Ramsey really be open to joining United this summer? Should we try to resign our former star if he open to returning to England?

PEORIA -- For the first time in more than a decade, Peoria could see new planes land at the Illinois Air National Guard base.                          The 182nd Airlift Wing, which flies the C-130H3 Hercules cargo plane, is on the short list of units that could receive the newest version of the plane, the J-model, according to a report from The National Guard Association of the United States last week.                          The Air Force has announced that eight units across the country are in the running for the 24 planes. Congress had approved funding for 16 of the newer planes and eight more were freed up when a Maryland Air National Guard wing, which was slated to change from an attack squadron to a transport, retained its A-10 Thunderbolt IIs.                          That means three of the eight will get J-models. All eight of the wings mentioned by the NGAUS article are flying the older H-models. The planes that Peoria-based unit is flying were built in the early- to mid-1990s.                          According to U.S. Air Force specifications, the new planes can fly faster and at a higher altitude. Additionally, the planes come with more advanced radar, which allows pilots to fly in all weather. Improved avionics -- the computers that assist in flying the plane -- also are incorporated into the newer models.                          All that matters because when the Air Force looks to shrink, units that have older equipment tend to go first. Many thought the acquisition of the H-model planes in 2005 spared the wing from closure during that round of base contraction.                          Col. Daniel R. McDonough, the 182nd's commander, said he's excited to see that the unit, which has been wanting the newer models for years, is among the final eight. Any decision, however, is likely months away. Before then, Air Force teams will look at mission, capacity, cost and environmental factors for each location, the NGAUS quoted a guard spokesman. The candidate sites were selected by the Air Guard and approved by the Air Force secretary.

The Air Force has announced that eight units across the country are in the running for the 24 planes. Congress had approved funding for 16 of the newer planes and eight more were freed up when a Maryland Air National Guard wing, which was slated to change from an attack squadron to a transport, retained its A-10 Thunderbolt IIs.                          That means three of the eight will get J-models. All eight of the wings mentioned by the NGAUS article are flying the older H-models. The planes that Peoria-based unit is flying were built in the early- to mid-1990s.                          According to U.S. Air Force specifications, the new planes can fly faster and at a higher altitude. Additionally, the planes come with more advanced radar, which allows pilots to fly in all weather. Improved avionics -- the computers that assist in flying the plane -- also are incorporated into the newer models.                          All that matters because when the Air Force looks to shrink, units that have older equipment tend to go first. Many thought the acquisition of the H-model planes in 2005 spared the wing from closure during that round of base contraction.                          Col. Daniel R. McDonough, the 182nd's commander, said he's excited to see that the unit, which has been wanting the newer models for years, is among the final eight. Any decision, however, is likely months away. Before then, Air Force teams will look at mission, capacity, cost and environmental factors for each location, the NGAUS quoted a guard spokesman. The candidate sites were selected by the Air Guard and approved by the Air Force secretary.                          "

“They won’t have experienced the crisis as we did, with a bit of fear, the lockdown. So for them it will be quite a surprise. They will learn the history, but it will be a history that is related to them," said a serving officer who was the doctor on the ballistic submarine “Le Triomphant" for four years. He spoke to the AP on condition that he be identified only by his first name and rank, in accordance with the rules of his branch of the French military.                                                                                                                                      “All events that could affect or change the morale of the crew members are kept from them," said the officer, Chief Doctor Gabriel. “Since there is no internet, no radio and no television on board, the only news you get comes from messages received by the commander, and the commander filters the messages to not give all of the information to everyone.”                                                                                                                                      The doctor was underwater in 2012 when an Islamic extremist killed three French paratroopers and later killed a rabbi, his two young sons and grabbed an 8-year-old girl and shot her in the head. Only later did the officer learn of the attacks, “so when people talk to me about it, I find it impossible to imagine,” he said.                                                                                                                                      “The only place where you are really cut off from all information is underwater, because even on a vessel in space there is still the radio, television, the internet," he said.

Mariners aboard ballistic submarines are habitually spared bad news while underwater to avoid undermining their morale, say current and former officers who served aboard France's nuclear-armed subs. So any crews that left port before the virus spread around the globe are likely being kept in the dark about the extent of the rapidly unfurling crisis by their commanders until their return, they say.                                                                                                                                      "They won’t know,” said retired Adm. Dominique Salles, who commanded the French ballistic submarine squadron from 2003-2006. “The boys need to be completely available for their mission.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Speaking exclusively to The Associated Press, Salles said he believes submariners will likely only be told of the pandemic as they head back to port, in the final two days of their mission.                                                                                                                                      “Those who are at sea don’t need this information," said Salles, who also commanded the nuclear-armed French submarine “L'Inflexible."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             “The commander, I think, is doubtless informed about what is happening. I don't think he'll have all the details," he said.                                                                                                                                      The French navy won't divulge what has or hasn't been said to submarine crews. Nor will it say whether any of the four French ballistic submarines, laden with 16 missiles that each can carry six nuclear warheads, left harbor before France instituted a nationwide lockdown on March 17.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             “Because the deterrent is wrapped in a bubble of protection and confidentiality, it is impossible to know whether the crews are informed or not of this situation,” French navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Olivier Ribard said.                                                                                                                                      French submarine missions last 60 to 70 days, with about 110 crew members aboard. So a crew that left at the end of February wouldn't be expected back before the end of April. In that case, they will return to a world changed by the pandemic. On March 1, France had just 130 confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths. In under a month, those numbers have surged past 2,600 dead and over 40,000 sickened.

A home health hub comprises of a wide range of health data of patients from the point of care that includes vital signs, weight, heart rates, blood sugar, blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, and electrocardiograms. The data can be transmitted to skilled health professionals in facilities such as hospitals and intensive care units, skilled nursing facilities, centralized off-site case management programs and monitoring centers. The patients monitored remotely by professionals are provided with a treatment plan based on the health data information. Many companies are focusing on developing innovative products. For instance, in January 2014, iHealth Lab Inc., launched three new wearable mobile personal health products-ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM), wearable pulse oximeter, and wireless ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG). Therefore, owing to the abovementioned factors, the demand for home health hubs is significantly increasing during the forecast period.

1. In 1830, William Seward became a State Senator for the Anti-Masonic Party. That same year, he helped make history: On September 11, he and 95 other Anti-Mason delegates gathered in Philadelphia. This week-long event was the first national convention to ever be orchestrated by an American political party.            2. Seward’s Auburn home was part of the Underground Railroad. According to an 1891 article in the Auburn Herald, “It is said that the old kitchen was one of the most popular stations of the Underground Railroad, and that many a poor slave who fled by this route to Canada carried to his grave the remembrance of its warmth and cheer.”            3. Seward and Harriet Tubman were good friends and she spent her later years in Auburn. Here, Seward — illegally — offered her a two-story house and seven acres of land. Tubman bought the property for $1,200 in 1859. She and Seward remained friends until the end of his days. When Tubman married Nelson Davis in Auburn on March 18, 1869, Seward attended the wedding.

"If it means wage cuts then that’s how it’s got to be. If we show solidarity, all four divisions, the 91 clubs, we all agree not to buy from each other and then none of the players can move and they’ll have to take it or leave it when it comes to the contracts.

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh garment manufacturers says fashion retailers have cancelled or put on hold more than $3 billion in orders due to the coronavirus outbreak, though a handful have agreed to pay anyway.                          The data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association released Monday reflected both orders already made or in the works and planned orders from the country, which is the world's second largest exporter of clothing after China.

Not understanding your health insurance plan's rules could cause you to incur extra costs needlessly. For example, your plan may require you to obtain a referral or preauthorization for certain specialists, tests, or procedures, and failing to go through the right channels could cause your insurer to refuse to pay for those services, leaving you on the hook for added bills. The same holds true about staying in-network -- seeing a provider your insurance company has approved could spell the difference between having a doctor's visit covered and being forced to pay the entire bill. If you're not sure how your health plan works, call the number on the back of your insurance card and run through your questions with a representative. And if you get health insurance through work, someone in your benefits department may be able to help as well.

The ongoing energy crisis has coaxed players operating in the global power transmission components market to develop products that are of superior quality. In tandem with this need, companies are focusing on introducing products that support digitization of grids for proving reliable and safe energy supply along with taking an active part in smart electrification projects. In a latest news, Schneider Electric India congratulated Indian Government’s efforts to electrify rural parts of the country with a focus on developing sustainable energy. On a similar note, the company initiated Energy Access Ventures Fund in 2015 for helping 20 small to medium-sized companies gain access to electricity. This venture aims to offer electricity supply to 625 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa access to electricity by the end of 2020. Such efforts, which require large-scale distribution of electricity and power, are expected to augment the demand for power transmission components in the near future.

A fresh bid to overturn a Singapore law banning gay sex failed Monday as a court dismissed several challenges, a setback for efforts to promote greater LGBT rights in Asia. Inherited from the British colonial era, the law is rarely enforced but campaigners say it nevertheless jars with the affluent city-state's increasingly modern and vibrant culture.
 Others however argue that Singapore remains at heart conservative and is not ready for change, while officials also believe most would not be in favour of repealing the legislation. The latest attempt to overturn the law was spearheaded by three people -- a retired doctor, a DJ and an LGBT rights advocate -- who lodged court challenges seeking to prove the law is unconstitutional.
 But the High Court dismissed all three after hearing them together behind closed doors, ruling the law does not violate articles of the constitution regarding equality and freedom of speech. The court also found the fact the legislation was not enforced did not "render it redundant".
 "Legislation remains important in reflecting public sentiment and beliefs," according to a summary of the judgement. M. Ravi, a lawyer for one of the complainants, told reporters outside court he was "very disappointed".
 "It's shocking to the conscience and it is so arbitrary. It is so discriminatory this legislation," he said. A first challenge to the law was dismissed in 2014. The repeated failure to overturn it contrasts sharply with progress made elsewhere in the region on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights.
 In 2018, India's Supreme Court decriminalised gay sex by overturning legislation from its own period under British rule -- a decision that spurred campaigners in Singapore to renew their efforts. And in Taiwan, lawmakers took the unprecedented step last year to legalise same-sex marriage, making the island the first place in Asia to do so.

 ASSAULT/HARASSMENT
   
 Police heard differing accounts of an incident Thursday afternoon at Interstate 759 and Black Creek Parkway. A 36-year-old man called police and said he was fixing his girlfriend's vehicle on the side of the road when a couple pulled up and the man shoved him against the vehicle, as the man and woman accused him of stealing something from them. He told police he ran and jumped across the fence into the median. He said the man chased him with his Jeep and at some point, the woman hit him in the back of the head. Medics were called to check the knot on the back of his head, but found no marks. Officers were called to the couple's home to make a report on an alleged assault. The 37-year-old woman told police she and her husband were driving on I-759 and saw the vehicle broken down on the side of the road. They stopped to offer assistance, then saw who the person with the vehicle was -- a man they say had stolen from them in the past. They decided to go and help him anyway, but when the man went to get tools, the alleged former thief punched her in the arm. Officers noted she had a slight red mark on her arm. She told police they did not retaliate, even though they wanted to. She said they got in their car and left.

I often wonder how they came to select it. They would’ve been standing in the tiny kitchen of their cramped Greenwich apartment, staring at the pile of papers — drafted guest lists, caterers’ business cards, venue release forms — scattered across the dinner table. My father might say, _Deb, no self-respecting man likes the Dixie Chicks_. (This was, of course, pre-Iraq.) One hand on her hip, the other propped against the counter, she’d hiss, _Sarah McLachlan is not a Dixie Chick. Whatever_ , he’d grunt. _Let’s do “I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” and call it a day,_ he’d say, slugging his Lagunitas. Probably she would mutter under her breath, _I knew I should’ve done this with Karen_ , which would, understandably, really set him off. _Your yuppie sister doesn’t know Lou Reed from a broken dishwasher_. And they would be fighting already, even though they weren’t married yet, which is when domesticity really goes sour, I guess. _At least she doesn’t listen to Blink-182 when she vacuums. It’s like living with a 17-year-old._ Even without children to fight about, there are always living disputes. _At least I vacuum, all you do is complain!_ and, realizing his gaffe, he’d gush, _I’m sorry. I’m really sorry, Deborah. I love you_ , falling to his knees before her, taking her hands and cupping them against his cheeks. She’d sigh. She was always sighing. _I love you, too. What about something from a movie?_ It would be immediate. Self-evident as if it were divinely sanctioned. In unison: _Ghost_?

BANGKOK (AP) — World markets started the week with fresh losses as countries reported surging numbers of infections from the coronavirus that are forcing shutdowns of travel and business in many regions.Shares fell in London, Paris and Tokyo but surged 7% in Australia after the government promised more recession-fighting stimulus."We want to keep the engine of our economy running through this crisis," Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra. His unprecedented $130 billion package includes wage subsidies of up to $1,500 per two weeks to businesses to keep workers on the job.U.S. futures yoyo'd throughout Asia's day but turned lower. The future for the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6% while that for the Dow industrials lost 0.8%. Oil prices were lower.Hopes that a $2 trillion U.S. relief bill would ease the economic havoc brought by the pandemic did little to alleviate the gloom prevailing in many markets.On Monday, Germany's DAX was flat at 9,634.00 while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.1% to 4,304.63. Britain's FTSE 100 declined 1.7% to 5,415.26.The pandemic relief bill approved by the Congress and signed Friday by President Donald Trump includes direct payments to households, aid to hard-hit industries like airlines and support for small businesses. Analysts expect markets to remain turbulent, however, until the outbreak begins to wane."Sentiment once again took a turn for the worse going into a week of reckoning by means of economic fundamentals," Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. "The rally seen for Wall Street last week may amount to little more but a relief rally with sentiment turning sour once again going into a fresh week."The push to deliver financial relief has gained urgency worldwide as the outbreak widens. The number of cases in the U.S. has now surpassed those in China and Italy, climbing to more than 142,000 known cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. The worldwide total has topped 723,000, and the death toll has topped 34,000, while nearly 152,000 have recovered.On Monday, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 1.6% to 19,084.97, while the Kospi in South Korea was flat at 1,717.12.

India's Sensex fell 4.2% to 28,524.43.Some investors have emerged to hunt for bargains as prices kept falling, said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities in Hong Kong.He views it as a bit too early."I think whatever rally you see, is really a false rally, it will be only a flash in the pan. It's only temporary. Don't go bottom fishing just yet because the worst is still to come," Lun said.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.The damage from the pandemic to corporate profits, the ultimate driver of stock prices, remains uncertain.But energy companies are suffering as the price of oil sinks. U.S. benchmark crude dropped 5.4% or $1.16 to $20.35 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It slid 4.8% to close at $21.51 a barrel on Friday. Goldman Sachs has forecast that it will fall well below $20 a barrel in the next two months because storage will be filled to the brim and wells will have to be shut in.Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 6% or $1.67 to $26.28 per barrel.The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.64% from 0.68% late Friday. Lower yields reflect dimmer expectations for economic growth and greater demand for low-risk assets.In currency trading, the dollar was at 107.57 Japanese yen, down from 107.94 late Friday. The euro weakened to $1.1094 from $1.1142.___Associated Press writer Alice Fung in Hong Kong contributed.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By Sophie Davies, Beh Lih Yi and Umberto Bacchi BARCELONA/KUALA LUMPUR/TBILISI, March 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - O n the streets of Barcelona, a few lone shoppers and dog walkers, their faces obscured by masks, are the only signs of life in this once-vibrant city — but online it's a different story.
 In Spain, as in the rest of the world, increasing numbers of people are going digital to keep community spirits up and avoid feelings of isolation during the coronavirus crisis, which has infected about 725,000 people and killed more than 34,000 worldwide. Since Spain's population of 47 million went into lockdown on March 14, there has been a flourishing of virtual parties, online classes and remote cultural events as people rush to find new ways to stay connected during the pandemic.
 On any given day, Barcelona residents can look at a list called #ElBarriDesdeTuCasa ("The Neighbourhood On Your Doorstep"), posted on the online community platform Nextdoor, and find five or six events in their neighbourhood alone. These kinds of online activities are useful for "keeping people motivated and giving them a reason to get out of bed in the morning", Joana Caminal, head of community at Nextdoor Spain, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.
 They are a good way of "getting people to interact more – at such a complicated time," she stressed. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Spain has reached more than 80,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.
 Since the start of March, 10 times more neighbourhood groups than usual have been created on Nextdoor Spain, with the site's number of global daily active users soaring by 80% in March from the previous month. On Tuesday, California- based Nextdoor launched a "Solidarity Map", letting registered users worldwide ask their neighbours for help or offer to help someone local in need.
 Online dating app Tinder is also finding new ways to bring people together at a time when everyone is keeping apart. The company has announced it is making its "Passport" feature free until April 30, meaning non-premium users, who can usually only connect with people in their current location, can "transport themselves out of self-quarantine to anywhere in the world".
 Health experts say that the internet could be a useful tool for staying positive during the pandemic. "In this unprecedented time, we are all, in most cases, very, very isolated from the world ... never in our lifetime have we experienced isolation like this," said Nathan L. Vanderford, an assisant professor at Kentucky University's medical school.
 "While the potential negative aspects of the internet still apply in our current situation, we can use these platforms to enhance our wellbeing," he added . However many elderly people are not plugged into social media and online activity also means we are "bathed in communication" about the pandemic, which could enhance stress, noted Sara Thomee, an assistant professor of psychology at Sweden's University of Gothenburg.
 VIRTUAL SOCIALISING Many people are also finding solace in virtual socialising, with colleagues and friends the world over raising a glass via video-conferencing platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams.
 In Asia, these sessions have become so popular they have given rise to a Japanese phenomenon called "on-nomi", or online drinking. With so many people working from home, virtual get-togethers are key to boosting team spirit, said Kate Walton, head of Steyer Content, a Seattle-based content agency.
 "People crave connection. It's a fundamentally human instinct," she said, noting that since her 100-strong team began working remotely a month ago, it has bonded over drinks in several so-called "virtual happy hour" sessions. Some online gatherings go beyond after-work drinks. In Malaysia, which imposed a partial lockdown on March 18, locals are organising online poetry readings, as well as a Stay at Home music festival to raise funds to buy food for medical workers.
 Jabier Grey, a languages teacher in Madrid who participated in another online music festival, CoronavirusFest, in March, said the thriving digital scene is giving people the chance to experiment with different ways of coming together. "It's a great opportunity for everybody ... I think some of the online (gatherings) are likely to remain online after (the crisis)," said Grey, who livestreamed a singing session from his flat via Instagram.
 In Germany's capital Berlin, the city's famous nightlife has gone digital, with about 250 nightclubs joining forces on the website United We Stream to livestream DJ sets into people's homes every evening from 7pm until midnight. In Italy, which has registered more coronavirus deaths than any other country, a group of artists and social media users have launched an Instagram account called My Sweet Quarantine to provide followers with a daily schedule of classes and performances.
 SELF-IMPROVEMENT While many people are going online to meet up without leaving their homes, others are using the web to learn something new.
 In Wuhan, the epicentre of China's coronavirus outbreak, 24-year-old Zhao Xiaowei has discovered a new culinary passion after the country's lockdown prompted him to start watching cookery classes on livestreams and the popular video app Douyin. "It's easier to pass time with technology during lockdown, or our day can be very dull," he said by phone.
 Over in the United States, Valerie Canon, a 38-year-old ballet teacher from Kentucky, said she has been inundated with responses since starting a Facebook page called "My Friends Do Awesome Things. Let's Learn from Them". The mother- of-three, who began by posting classes to keep her students fit during lockdown, said that within three days 1,500 people were using the page, giving her and others the chance to learn a host of "awesome and useful things."
 "In the past few days, I have learned how to put victory rolls in my hair, make a Manhattan (and) how to make an at-home cleaner with citrus fruit and apple vinegar," she said. Museums from Paris to Tbilisi have also moved online, providing virtual tours of their collections or letting artists film live performances in empty rooms.
 "We wanted to show that even though we are physically closed, we remain open as an institution that produces culture, disseminating experiences and knowledge," said Stefano Boeri, president of the Triennale Art & Design Museum in Milan. Malaysian yoga instructor Susan Tam, who has moved her classes online, said staying digitally active is important for bridging the gap between people caused by self-isolation and social distancing.
 "We are used to having these social connections," she said. "Doing live online classes means we can still have the community connection without the risk - it's good for our health."

The ship has been at sea since March 14 when it was refused permission to dock in Chile, where the cruise was due to end in San Antonio on March 21.                                                     Holland America Line began transferring healthy passengers to a sister ship docked nearby, the Rotterdam, which has been providing the Zaandam with medical supplies and personnel.                                                     It is not yet known whether the Rotterdam will also be allowed to pass through the Panama Canal.                                                     The move comes after families of Britons travelling on the vessel called on the UK Government to rescue their relatives - many of whom have been confined to their cabins since Sunday.
