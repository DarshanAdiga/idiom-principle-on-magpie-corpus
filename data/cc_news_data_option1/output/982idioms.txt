 It's still too early in the Mustang Mach-E's development to expect Ford to let me pry a key fob from its hand, but the company is still eager to show off the capabilities of its new through-the-road all-wheel-drive system, and Smithers is an excellent place to do it.
 We've only been in the Rapid Red Metallic test car for a few minutes, and already, we're getting sideways in the best possible way. Another Ford engineer, Ashok Rodrigues, development lead on the Mach-E's AWD system, is making big slip angles look easy, summoning them with a minimum of steering input and a gentle roll on and off of the accelerator. As it turns out, the 2021 Mustang Mach-E is a monster electric donut machine.
 This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Ford has acknowledged expertise in AWD systems, and electric cars that power all four corners are known to be particularly controllable in the white stuff -- just ask our editor in chief, Tim Stevens, who barreled around Alaskan proving grounds in a Tesla Model 3 last year.
 As Deibler hinted earlier, it wasn't always going to be this way. Ford had originally been working on a new electrified crossover that was to spin off hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric variants; a front-wheel-drive chassis with a different name and mission in mind. When the decision to totally rework this project into an all-electric Mustang came down from on high, that's when Deibler and Rodrigues' jobs got a lot more interesting.

But the Pistons aren’t without advantages. They’ll hold his early Bird rights, which gives them the ability to exceed the salary cap to re-sign him. They’d be limited to offering him slightly more – 105 percent – of the 2019-20 average NBA salary via the early Bird exception. That will be a first-year salary of slightly more than $10 million.

The global outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 has already taught you how to cough into your inner elbow, thoroughly wash your hands and what kind of face masks will and won't protect you best. But if you plan to go to work, dine out, shop in stores and ride public transportation, you'll need practical tips to feel comfortable while keeping yourself -- and others -- safe.
 I'm a tech journalist, not an infectious disease expert. But I want to share some practices I adopted during my recent trip to Portugal and England at a time when confirmed COVID-19 cases began spiking in Italy, Germany, France and Spain. I've continued to follow them since returning to Silicon Valley as well.
 The day before my flight back, two baggage handlers at London's Heathrow Airport, my departure hub, tested positive for the virus. But ironically, it's my home in Santa Clara County that might put me at greater risk to exposure -- there are currently 43 known cases and 1 death at a hospital just five miles away. For the time being, I intend to stay part of the world. Carefully.
 ## Enough with the fingertips: Use your knees, feet, elbows and knuckles instead
 If you're still pressing elevator buttons with your fingertips, stop. Any time you have to open a door, push a button, pull a lever or digitally sign for something, use a different body part instead. You have plenty.
 For example, I'll often tap out a pin code with my knuckle instead of the pad of my finger, or push open a door with my shoulder, hip or foot instead of my hands.
 You can usually flip on a lightswitch or sink faucet with your elbow or wrist, and you can wrap the sleeve of your sweater or jacket around the handle of doors you have to physically pull open. It's easy enough to toss your clothing into the wash later rather than expose your skin now, especially if the chances you'll use your hands to touch food items is high (e.g. you're opening the door to a coffee shop).

"Now that he is the government, he can afford to offer inducements to many… I found that some of my supporters have been made ministers, so they switched sides," he reportedly said, according to a translation by Malay Mail.

“This is a disaster that could have been avoided. That's the hardest thing to come to terms with," said Bahru Zewde, a member of the Ethiopian Airlines Pilots' Association, at a memorial held by the group in Addis Ababa on Tuesday afternoon. "It was an unnecessary sacrifice they paid. They have become martyrs.”

There seems to me to be a connection between bad policies and disfigured streets, which seem to be getting worse, says _Paul Finch_                                                     I was disconcerted, to say the least, to see what has happened in King’s Parade, Cambridge, ( _pictured_ ). The unbelievable crudeness of the traffic management kit, a near-deliberate insult to its architectural context, has to be seen to be believed. Why do they do it?

The process began June 12, 1820, with a convention in St. Louis. It was decided the seat of government stay in St. Louis until October 1826 and then move to a point on the Missouri river within forty miles of the Osage river.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Five Commissioners were appointed to select a location that complied with that resolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    However, agreeing on a location for a temporary seat of government was easier said than done. On October 6, Mr. Ledue of St. Louis, suggested St. Louis. It didn't pass. Other suggestions followed over the next few days. St. Charles, Franklin, and Florissant were named as possible locations, but they, too, were voted down. Mr. Rogers of Cooper County proposed Boonville, but it failed to carry by a vote of 13 to 22. Other suggestions included Ste. Genevieve and Herculaneum. Finally, after 84 days, the session was adjourned and St. Charles was agreed upon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A notice was issued by the governor April 20, 1821, calling for the Legislature to assemble June 4 to pass an act \"Providing for the Location of the Permanent Seat of Government.\" Again, much time was taken to decide where the capital would be. It was finally narrowed down to Cote Sans Dessein and Howard's Bluff. Howard's Bluff was chosen and the City of Jefferson was laid out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Now that the location was decided, the next legal steps began that would sell certain lots for the funds to construct the building. The contract for building the capitol went to Daniel Colgan Jr. for $24,739.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The state legislature met in St. Charles from June 1821 to December 1826. After that, it met in Jefferson City.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     _Elizabeth Davis was born and raised in Cooper County, Missouri, and has written HISTORICALLY YOURS for the Boonville Daily News since April 2008, She has covered the War Between the States, US history, and Cooper County history.

IBM on Wednesday announced several new IBM Watson technologies designed to help organisations begin identifying, understanding and analysing some of the most challenging aspects of the English language with greater clarity, for greater insights. The new technologies represent the first commercialisation of key Natural Language Processing NLP capabilities to come from IBM Researchs Project Debater, the AI system capable of debating humans on complex topics, it said in a statement.For example, a new advanced sentiment analysis feature is defined to identify and analyse idioms and colloquialisms for the first time, the company said. Phrases, like hardly helpful, or hot under the collar, have been challenging for AI systems because they are difficult for algorithms to spot.With advanced sentiment analysis, businesses can begin analysing such language data with Watson APIs for a more holistic understanding of their operations, the statement said. Further, IBM is bringing technology from IBM Research for understanding business documents, such as PDFs and contracts, to also add to their AI models, it said.Director of IBM Research India and CTO, IBM India South Asia, Gargi Dasgupta said IBM Research has been developing and advancing NLP capabilities for years to create intuitive AI systems that can offer deeper business insights, explain decisions, and are less labor-intensive to deploy and maintain. So far, enterprises have been exposed to a fraction of AIs vast potential and to make AI more pervasive - it needs to better understand customers and business operations, according to her.With these new capabilities infused in Watson, Indian organisations have the potential to enhance everything from customer care and transportation, to finance and education, she added..

HighlightsIndia has evacuated 948 people from coronavirus hit nations900 of these are Indian nationalsRest are citizens of friendly countries including US, China and South Africa India's fight against coronavirus has seen the successful evacuation of close to a thousand people from the virus-infected countries so far, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday.900 of these evacuees are Indian nationals while 49 others are from friendly countries, mostly neighbours, including Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, US, Madagascar, Nepal, South Africa and Sri Lanka.The health ministry confirmed that last such rescue operation was conducted on the 9th of March when 58 nationals were brought back from Iran, the third-worst affected country.The evacuees were brought back in a C-17 flight operated by the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the ministry says this was the first of the several batches to be brought back from Iran.India and Iran have both begun operations to evacuate citizens stranded in each other's territories and have pledged full cooperation in this regard.India is trying to set up a laboratory in Iran to test all Indians for the coronavirus to expedite their exit and in the meanwhile, their samples are being sent to India in batches for testing onboard special Mahan Air flights, an Iranian career.Close to 300 people have died in Iran due to the virus and over 8,000 people are affected. In Italy, the country with the most fatalities after China, infections topped 10,000. A total of 52 people have been detected with the virus in India as against over 116,000 infections globally. 4,000 people have lost their lives the world over.

The exposure to the Communication Services sector increased to over 15% with the purchase of Orange and the top up of the shareholding in Vodafone when the share price dipped post the dividend cut. While the growth rate for telecommunication companies is pedestrian but stable, there is a strong supporting dividend yield. The Energy sector is normally similar, in the sense that there is a substantial dividend yield which can be maintained even with oil prices 10-15% lower than those seen at the end of 2019. However, the breakdown in relations between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil production quotas, with Saudi Arabia responding through increased production has led to a 30% fall in the price of crude oil. Whilst this is not considered sustainable in the long term, it may continue long enough to cause the major oil companies to reset their dividends. Accompanying share price falls may then provide investment opportunities, as the share prices of energy companies will fluctuate with sentiment over energy demand. There is the obvious issue of carbon emissions and most of the major energy companies are diversifying into sustainable energy sources and working on carbon offsets. However, the fact remains that they are primarily hydrocarbon companies. We believe it is important that the major energy companies seek to minimise their environmental impact during the extended transition to reduce carbon emissions. Our assessment of the quality of potential portfolio holdings in the areas of environmental, social and governance issues, forms an integral part of our investment analysis process. Environmental, social and governance scores are assessed as part of the production of the Edinburgh Partners' research for each stock. We also seek to engage with companies on issues of concern where appropriate. We believe the global economy will continue to rely on fossil fuels for some time to come and resolution on emissions lies at government level. Therefore, we continue to invest in the major energy companies, subject to the caveats on their efforts to minimise the impact of their operations on the environment.

NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein is back in court Wednesday for the final act of the rape trial that landed him behind bars: a sentencing hearing where the once-powerful film producer will learn just how long he’ll stay in prison for his landmark #MeToo conviction.

In a nutshell, the NHS Finance (Wales) Act 2014 gives all health boards in Wales a grace period of three years to get within their budgets.
 Following strict scrutiny, these three-year plans (Integrated Medium Term Plans) are then drawn up by health boards and approved by the Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething.
 However, Betsi Cadwaladr UHB, Hywel Dda UHB and Swansea Bay UHB were unable to submit approvable plans for 2019-20 to 2021-22.
 Hywel Dda developed an annual plan for 2019-20, while Swansea Bay and Betsi Cadwaladr developed draft plans which could not be finalised due to "significant ongoing challenges relating to performance and finance".
 As a consequence, each of these health boards are under some form of Welsh Government intervention.

It was on Feb. 25 when McNichol retrieved from the laboratory the device and two secured DVDs containing data which was extracted from the device.                                                    He reviewed the data and noted that the information allegedly documented 4,155 images, and that the vast majority of these images portrayed children posing nude, posing for cameras and acting out sexual intercourse.                                                    Nude photos of Scholten – who allegedly accessed internet chat sites on the phone to communicate with unidentified users for the purpose of conversation and to exchange images – were also found on the device.                                                    Authorities state that the provided documentation recorded more than 70 social media chats between the cellphone user and other social media users. In several of these chats, the individuals communicating with Scholten told him that they were 13-14 years old.                                                    The documentation also allegedly shows an association between the cellular device and multiple social media accounts with multiple usernames.                                                    Zapolski advised that, during the analysis of the phone, he found indications that data had been uploaded from the phone to an account associated with one of Scholten’s alleged e-mail/usernames.                                                    McNichol swore to a search warrant for the account associated with the e-mail/username. Upon receiving and reviewing the data provided, he says that he noted at least 549 videos. The vast majority of the videos in question allegedly contained content consistent with CSAM.                                                    McNichol reviewed the documentation from the related cellphone and online account, which allegedly shows a variety of sexual interactions involving children, both male and female.                                                     As previously reported, Scholten started out as interim executive director of the OACC on Sept. 3, 2019, when the former director left this position.                                                    Scholten and his wife had moved from Grand Rapids to Oscoda about six months prior.                                                    The chamber board of directors then presented Scholten with a contract to be hired as the official executive director on Dec. 13, 2019. They accepted his resignation, though, just 16 days after he took the job.                                                    Conflicting information was provided, and a Dec. 30, 2019 press release from the OACC  read that Scholten’s resignation was effective on Dec. 29.                                                    According to the document, Scholten expressed that, due to personal challenges, he could no longer serve as the director.                                                    A second press release was issued the next day, however, in which it was stated that the OACC has a very active and hands-on board of directors who unanimously agreed that the organization needed a different person to lead the charge for the community.

From 1990 onward, there were numerous reports of “attack-of-angle” sensors (i.e., sensors that resemble weather vanes) being damaged by bird strikes, ground equipment and jet way collisions. In 2008, an A320 demonstration flight crashed on the French coast, killing all seven on board. Moisture inside two of the plane’s three angle-of-attack vanes froze. This relatively high incidence number makes it more than justifiable to question Boeing’s decision to enable the sensors on the Max model to become empowered beyond merely warning pilots of potential stalls and to instead automatically force a plane’s nose down.

The AIFMD introduced a requirement for the AIFM to set maximum levels of leverage for the Company. The Company's AIFM has set a maximum limit of 1.25 for both the Gross and Commitment Methods of calculating leverage. However, the AIFM anticipates that the figures are likely to be lower than this under normal market conditions. At 31 December 2019, the Company's Gross ratio was 1.00 and its Commitment ratio was 1.00. In accordance with the AIFMD, any changes to the maximum level of leverage set by the Company will be communicated to Shareholders.

Since making his debut in the 50-over format in 2016, Jasprit Bumrah has had a meteoric rise and has become the leader of India's pace attack. His unmatched accuracy, ability to keep a lid on runs coupled with wicket taking abilities, make him an asset for captain Virat Kohli. The extent of Bumrah's outstanding start to his ODI career can be gauged from the fact that he is the second fastest Indian to the 100-wicket mark, missing Mohammed Shami's mark by just one match.His performances on flat Indian tracks have also been a highlight of his short career so far. But ever since his return from injury, sustained after India's tour of West Indies last year, the paceman has not been at his best. In the six ODIs he has played this year, Bumrah has managed to pick only 1 wicket and averages a rather unbelievable 287. The three-match India vs South Africa series thus provides a perfect platform for the paceman to return to form.Bumrah played 3 ODIs against Australia at home in January, and picked up only 1 wicket in the entire series, which India managed to win 2-1. But the real shocker came in New Zealand as he failed to pick up a single wicket in the three matches, and also went for runs. The direct impact was seen in the result as India were whitewashed in an ODI series after 31 long years.The paceman though holds a good record against South Africa and that is where Indian fans can hope for a revival. He has picked up 12 wickets in 8 matches against the Proteas, but the impressive part lies in the economy. Bumrah has conceded only 3.83 runs per over against South Africa. That shows how difficult it is to get him away.The Indian team is reeling from the impact of the twin whitewashes, in ODIs and Tests, in New Zealand and needs a good series against South Africa to get back to wining ways. Bumrah and Virat Kohli will be the two players the team will look at to get them out of this hole and both are ready for the challenge.

Since January 2017, Horning and other TUA Board members have been advising the council that there are some very expensive projects identified in the TUA’s Asset Management Plan (AMP) and Capital Improvements Plan (CIP), with the original one- to five-year plan amounting to about $3 million. So, the board has discussed grouping several of the projects for completion with one funding source.                                                    “And the board has knocked off some of those things but, all along, we’ve discussed grouping some of those projects and doing big financing for those, instead of just picking and choosing which ones we’re going to do,” Horning elaborated.                                                    She said the priorities have changed a bit since 2017, and the five-year CIP is expected to now cost about $3.5 million.                                                    Since the six- to 10-year plan is less than $1 million, Horning said it makes sense to finance all 10 of those for 20 years, instead of just five for the 20 years.                                                    She noted that, with the various improvements in mind, the council has approved increases in sewer rates over the last few years to build sewer fund reserves. They also agreed to contribute an additional $100,000 to the TUA budget in the 2019-20 fiscal year. “The total in the TUA budget for capital improvements for the 2019-20 fiscal year is $410,000, with $200,000 of this committed for future capital improvements.”                                                    Horning said the upgrades were reviewed and discussed during a tour of the TUA plant last October. It was at this time when a Fleis and VandenBrink (F&V) Engineering representative reviewed the findings of the AMP and projects, and presented funding opportunities for the TUA.                                                    The TUA Board then asked F&V staff to compile a list of projects for funding through the State Revolving Fund (SRF) that would allow them to finance a large project for 20-30 years at a low interest rate – about two percent for a $5 million loan.                                                    The board voted last November to submit a notice of intent to apply for SRF funding for a project totaling $4,917,000, with the understanding that they would review the project before final submission to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE).                                                    Horning said it was during the February TUA Board meeting when a presentation was given by EGLE Senior Project Manager Eric Pocan, who shared a copy of the financing schedule for the SRF. He discussed opportunities for principle forgiveness, if the TUA follows some federal guidelines for Green Project Reserves.                                                    Horning said this is a brand new program, though, and it is unclear yet how it is going to work.                                                    Following a public hearing, the project plan would have to be submitted to EGLE by Aug. 1. There will not be a full commitment to the SRF funding, however, until the loan documents are signed. There are four opportunities to do so, through August 2021.                                                    “We’ve had a couple of exceedances in the treatment that we’ve had to report to EGLE, which are of concern to us,” Horning told the council. “They’ve commented that our operating company is doing a very good job making the necessary adjustments to try and prevent those, and they’re doing a great job with the very antiquated, deficient equipment that they’ve inherited.”                                                    She and Councilman Mike Russo voted at the February TUA meeting in favor of a motion that would move the SRF process along in order to meet the public hearing requirements, so that the application can be submitted by Aug. 1. That motion, though, was defeated in a 2-2 tie vote.                                                    “In accordance with TUA’s Articles of Incorporation, I requested that a third party be brought in to make a decision and break the tie vote. I also requested that special meetings be scheduled to move the process along since timing is becoming a concern for us with the several delays,” Horning stated.

John Turner, 33, testified at the preliminary hearing that he and his 14-year-old cousin were in a car operated by McCauley when McCauley said he had to meet someone. Turner, who was in the back seat, said the vehicle was parked in front of a residence along Rose Tree Lane when “three dudes walked up to the car.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Turner said two of the males got in the back seat with him, squeezing him in the middle. The third male stayed at the corner. Soon after McCauley pulled off, Turner said the individual to his left asked, “Yo, you got that?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Turner said there was some haggling between McCauley and that person before they arrived at a price of $375. Turner said neither he nor his cousin were in the car when the shooting occurred. He testified he heard a noise, but did not know what it was and did not see anyone injured when he and his cousin returned to the car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    McCauley hit the gas and took off, according to Turner. When his cousin asked McCauley what happened, McCauley allegedly responded, “I f---- shot that kid.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Ficchi testified that a .40-caliber bullet recovered from the victim’s neck was fired from a Springfield Armory firearm found in the rear yard of the victim’s home. The firearm was found in a rut under a detached shed. The firearm was reported stolen in February 2018 in Haverford.

IBM on Wednesday announced several new IBM Watson technologies designed to help organisations begin identifying, understanding and analysing some of the most challenging aspects of the English language with "greater clarity, for greater insights". The new technologies represent the first commercialisation of key Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities to come from IBM Research's Project Debater, the AI system capable of debating humans on complex topics, it said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For example, a new advanced sentiment analysis feature is defined to identify and analyse idioms and colloquialisms for the first time, the company said. Phrases, like 'hardly helpful,' or 'hot under the collar,' have been challenging for AI systems because they are difficult for algorithms to spot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    With advanced sentiment analysis, businesses can begin analysing such language data with Watson APIs for a more holistic understanding of their operations, the statement said. "Further, IBM is bringing technology from IBM Research for understanding business documents, such as PDF's and contracts, to also add to their AI models", it said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Director of IBM Research India and CTO, IBM India South Asia, Gargi Dasgupta said IBM Research has been developing and advancing NLP capabilities for years to create intuitive AI systems that can offer deeper business insights, explain decisions, and are less labor-intensive to deploy and maintain. So far, enterprises have been exposed to a fraction of AI's vast potential and to make AI more pervasive - it needs to better understand customers and business operations, according to her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "With these new capabilities infused in Watson, Indian organisations have the potential to enhance everything from customer care and transportation, to finance and education", she added..

Speaking at an evidence session to the Assembly's Public Accounts Committee about the NHS Finance (Wales) Act 2014, chief executive of the Welsh NHS Dr Andrew Goodall said he was "very disappointed" with the projected deficit of the three health boards.
 "Eight out of our 11 NHS organisations will break even and seven out of our 11 organisations have approved [financial] plans," he said.
 "Having said that though, I am disappointed in the three organisations that have still not been able to overcome their deficit. We would have expected improvements in all of those during this year."
