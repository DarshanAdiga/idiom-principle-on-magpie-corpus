Known for its numerous ancient cities, paradisical beaches, dynamic downtown and world-class resorts, Antalya is a must-see spot for travelers visiting Turkey. It’s hard to get bored in Antalya thanks to the number of places to visit and things to do.

Even though it is located only 13 kilometers (8 miles) north of the Köprülü Canyon Rafting Center, this heavenly site lacks the publicity it deserves and needs better and safer tourist organization. Tazı Canyon’s main observation deck is located in the province of Antalya; however, a small part of the canyon also stands within the borders of Isparta.

The locals of Gaziler village, the closest settlement to the canyon located adjacent to the parking lot, are very friendly. The local women use the parking area to display their entrepreneurial skills by selling their handmade artisanal crafts, dairy products and fruits and vegetables they grow on their own land. Before I headed to the canyon, I decided to take my time to see what these creative locals offer and perhaps exchange a few words with them.

Yet since the early days of the pandemic, experts have questioned the health and safety protocols at the White House and asked why more wasn’t being done to protect the commander in chief. Trump continued to shake hands with visitors long after public health officials were warning against it and he initially resisted being tested. He has been reluctant to practice his own administration’s social distancing guidelines for fear of looking weak, including refusing under almost all circumstances to wear a mask in public.


--DocBreak--
Unfortunately, Tazı Canyon’s increasing popularity is not supported by an improvement in tourism organization. There are some perils that might become serious safety issues if you&#39;re not careful. First of all, the top of the huge boulders near the cliff of the canyon are covered with slippery algae. I was alarmed to see some people hopping around on these boulders and walking to the edge of the cliff to take selfies. Not to mention, the strong winds that blow abruptly can easily disrupt one’s balance.

The White House got its first COVID-19 scare in early March when at least three people who later tested positive came in close proximity to the president at his private Florida club. That included members of the Brazilian president’s delegation, including the Brazilian chargé d’affaires, who sat at Trump’s dinner table.

The very next minute saw me parking my vehicle and heading toward the rafting stations. I took a delightful hourlong private rafting tour and paddled through the medium-difficulty rapids in Köprüçay River.

Tazı Canyon is located within Köprülü Canyon National Park, which is among the prime spots for rafting in Antalya and in Turkey at large. Every day, hundreds of adventurers go rafting on Köprüçay River, stream-sourced whitewater from the mountains, over which the rafting stations are built in Manavgat district.

"articleBody": "Antalya is at the heart of Turkish tourism. Every year, millions visit this coastal haven to see the world-renowned attractions it boasts. Even in a time when parts of the world were brought to halt by the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 7.25 million tourists flocked to Turkey. As usual, Istanbul and Antalya received the biggest slices of the pie.

How Tazı Canyon became popular is quite a story. Although photos of the canyon have been shared on several social media platforms since 2017, it wasn&#39;t until February 2019 that Tazı Canyon’s fame skyrocketed on account of a commercial released by the smartphone brand Huawei.

On July 3rd, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tested positive in South Dakota before an Independence Day fireworks show at Mount Rushmore.

Before I visit a place, I try to keep my expectations low but for Tazı Canyon, I had no doubt that I would be witnessing ineffable natural scenery, so was very excited about my visit.


--DocBreak--
Sadly, almost all of the visitors to Antalya leave without knowing about the existence of Tazı Canyon (sometimes also referred to as Wisdom Valley). This was obvious when I visited this natural wonder, as there were no signs of the crowds I had seen earlier at the rafting center. During the COVID-19 pandemic, you can take advantage of how secluded Tazı Canyon is and pay a visit to this stunning natural beauty without having have to worry about social distancing

The vice president and a majority of either the Cabinet or another body established by law, can also declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, in which case Pence would “immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President” until Trump could provide a written declaration to the contrary.",

The parking lot of Tazı Canyon is just an area comprised of flattened ground, so don’t expect a smooth parking space of asphalt. More importantly, this spot is located 800 meters from the main observation deck of the canyon. The dirt road between the parking lot and the canyon is very bumpy, therefore, unless you have a jeep or an SUV vehicle suitable for off-road conditions, I suggest parking your car and walking the rest of the path, or perhaps riding an ATV to the canyon.


--DocBreak--
As I reached the edge of the canyon, I witnessed a visual feast. I have been to countless places in Turkey and visited many natural wonders and archaeological sites; however, Tazı Canyon was perhaps the most breathtaking natural wonder I have ever seen in the country, and I can assure you that this is no exaggeration. A genuine reaction of “Wow!” from a young British traveler, who was a part of a small tourist group that arrived at the canyon at the same time I did, proved my point.

Senior staff have been tested for COVID-19 daily since two people who work at the White House complex tested positive in early May, prompting the White House to step up precautions. Everyone who comes into contact with the president also receives a quick-result test.

The asphalt road is wide and in good condition all the way to the Köprülü Canyon Rafting Center, so for me, the drive was very comfortable. The 13-kilometer distance between Köprülü and Tazı canyons takes 25 minutes to complete. After passing the Köprülü Canyon Rafting Center, take the first left and follow the signs that will take you to the parking lot of Tazı Canyon. After taking that left turn, the road narrows. There is still space for two cars to drive; however, considering that tours to Tazı Canyon orient toward large pickups and off-road vehicles, I advise you to drive carefully.

But by June, concerns at the White House had dissipated once again, with few staffers bothering with masks even as more and more people tested positive for the virus, including campaign staffers preparing for a Tulsa rally and Secret Service agents.

“Even before the smartphone commercial was released, Tazı Canyon was known among some foreigners. In previous years, we had a considerable number of adventurers from Australia, America and even New Zealand, who traveled all the way here to appreciate the view that the canyon offers. However, recently, it is mostly local tourists who come here. Some time ago, a couple even swore their marital oath here, right near the cliff of the canyon. The rising popularity of Tazı Canyon is also giving us a chance to sell our local goods and have a midscale market here. To the women of Gaziler village, it comes as a motivating incentive.”

In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday, Trump said he was awaiting results of a COVID-19 test. “Whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don’t know,” he said, adding that first lady Melania Trump was also awaiting results.

On May 7, the White House announced that a member of the military serving as one of the president’s personal valets tested positive for the virus, followed a day later by a positive diagnosis for Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary.

Trump’s positive test comes just hours after the White House announced that senior aide Hope Hicks had come down with the virus after traveling with the president several times this week. Trump was last seen by reporters returning to the White House on Thursday evening and looked to be in good health. Trump is 74 years old, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has now killed more than 205,000 people nationwide.

The news was sure to rattle an already shaken nation still grappling with how to safely reopen while avoiding further spikes. The White House has access to near-unlimited resources, including a constant supply of quick-result tests, and still failed to keep the president safe, raising questions about how the rest of the country will be able to protect its workers, students and the public as businesses and schools reopen.

In mid-March, as the virus continued to spread across the country, the White House began taking the temperature of everyone entering the White House complex, and in April, it began administering rapid COVID-19 tests to all those in close proximity to the president, with staffers being tested about once a week. The frequent tests gave some staff the false impression the complex was safe from the virus, and few, as a result, followed recommended safety protocols, including wearing masks.

While there is currently no evidence that Trump is seriously ill, the positive test also raises questions about what would happen if he were to become incapacitated due to illness. The Constitution’s 25th Amendment spells out the procedures under which a president can declare themselves “unable to discharge the powers and duties” of the presidency. If he were to make that call, Trump would transmit a written note to the Senate president pro tempore, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pence would serve as acting president until Trump transmitted “a written declaration to the contrary.”

After our warm chat, I got some dried fruit from Hatice Hanım’s stall. The idea of going to the canyon with an ATV sounded attractive, so I decided to rent one. The round-trip rate for an ATV is TL 50 ($6.50), which included a safety helmet. I rode less than 10 minutes and parked it near a tree. As I was walking to the observation deck, I saw a quaint open-air gözleme shack with a huge teapot brewing over a log fire. I can never say no to gözleme, especially homemade ones prepared by sweet, old Turkish women who patiently layer the thin sheets of dough with their fillings. Having decided to save it for later, I headed straight to the ridge of the canyon.

The diagnosis marks a major blow for a president who has been trying desperately to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is behind them even as cases continue to rise just weeks before the Nov. 3 election.

Tazı Canyon has rich flora and fauna. With magnificent walls reaching as high up as 400 meters (1,312 feet), bears, bobcats, caracals, wild boars, deer, foxes, wolves, badgers, rabbits, lynxes, snakes, rock eagles and vultures are just some of the wildlife that calls this area home. Moreover, if you look around carefully, you can see the eagles and vultures flying slightly below the cliff.
