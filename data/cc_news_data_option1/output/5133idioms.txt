The Lindbergs, a musical duo from the early 1960s, carried the cut and thrust of folk songs through the horrors of apartheid. Directing, choreographing, performing and curating, they never lost their will to robustly support the arts industry. Armed with a magic dragon named "Puff" and a seagull named "Nelson" in their lyrics, they managed to subversively filter confrontational anti-apartheid values into happy, catchy popular culture, in ways that few other musical practitioners could at the time. Dawn Lindberg died in Plettenberg Bay on 8 December 2020 from Covid-19. She was 75.

Soul è un viaggio complesso, che comporta parecchia riflessione a ogni battuta o quasi dei personaggi. Ci restituisce una curiosa, quanto severa a tratti, trasposizione della condizione umana, edulcorando forse quello che succede al nostro corpo e alla nostra anima quando siamo in bilico tra questo mondo e l'aldilà. Ma tutto il colore di questo film che lo avvicina al recente successo Netflix Over The Moon a tratti, per il suo essere caleidoscopico, non riesce a depistare quella che è la via principale del plot: raccontare quanto sia consistente e considerevole la nostra anima. Dare un colore, uno spessore, una vita, paradossalmente, a quella parte di noi che pesa quei leggendari 21 grammi in grado di fare la differenza e renderci unici.

 “I’m enjoying it. I enjoy playing anywhere in midfield, but I want to be getting assists and goals. Being a bit higher is where I want to play and I’m getting a lot of chances now to make the runs in behind to get the goals and assists.
 “I’ve been waiting for that goal to come. I missed one in the first half on Saturday where the keeper’s fallen on the ball and managed to save it. I thought it was going to be one of those days again, but we are getting in those positions a lot now and I think I’m getting in the box a lot more, so hopefully there will be more goals to come.”

Rapid urbanization globally has led to robust increase in the security services market with a view to identify technical security vulnerabilities. Surge in demand for need of safety and security solutions and counter- surveillance for government as well as commercial uses facilitate increased sales of these equipment. In addition, detection of espionage and information theft to curb cybercrime also drive the TSCM equipment market growth. However, policy changes, intense competition, disturbance in international geo- political factors, changing government regulations and bureaucracy, and increased price of electronic goods are the factors that act as obstacles in the market growth. Contrarily, potential loss and reputational damage, owing to informational breach can outweigh the cost of implementing a proactive TSCM strategy. Innovative tactical counter surveillance products are expected to continue to meet worldwide needs of commercial, defense, law enforcement, and government customers, which provides new pathways for the TSCM equipment market share.

“They used to ask me how it feels to be the ‘first colored country singer,’ ” he told _The Dallas Morning News_ in 1992. “Then it was ‘first Negro country singer;’ then ‘first black country singer.’ Now I’m the ‘first African- American country singer.’ That’s about the only thing that’s changed. This country is so race-conscious, so ate-up with colors and pigments. I call it ‘skin hangups’ — it’s a disease.”
 Pride was raised in Sledge, Mississippi, the son of a sharecropper. He had seven brothers and three sisters.
 In 2008 while accepting a Lifetime Achievement Award as part of the Mississippi Governor’s Awards for Excellence in the Arts, Pride said he never focused on race.
 “My older sister one time said, ‘Why are you singing THEIR music?’” Pride said. “But we all understand what the y’all-and-us-syndrome has been. See, I never as an individual accepted that, and I truly believe that’s why I am where I am today.”
 As a young man before launching his singing career, he was a pitcher and outfielder in the Negro American League with the Memphis Red Sox and in the Pioneer League in Montana.
 After playing minor league baseball a couple of years, he ended up in Helena, Montana, where he worked in a zinc smelting plant by day and played country music in nightclubs at night.
 Pride was part of the Texas Rangers’ ownership group for the last 10 years and the team was to fly the flags at half-staff at Globe Life Field and Globe Life Park on Sunday and today in his memory.
 “The Texas Rangers join the country music world in mourning the loss of Charley Pride. While Mr. Pride was a legendary performer who entertained millions of fans in the United States and around the world, we will remember him as a true friend to this franchise,” the team said in a statement.

No. 17 North Carolina had the opportunity to make a statement this weekend against No. 10 Miami. The Tar Heels showed up and rushed all over the Hurricanes. Led by the two-headed monster featured below, Mack Brown's team amassed 554 rushing yards and six touchdowns on 55 carries. It was an historic performance. Those were just a few of the notable running back performances from the weekend. Let's break them down.
 ## Javonte Williams and Michael Carter, North Carolina
 As I am typing this article, Williams and Carter just rattled off a few more long runs. It was that kind of day for the Tar Heels backs as they combined for 544 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 47 yards (11.6 yards per carry). It was an NCAA record for a pair of teammates. North Carolina was not doing anything exotic. The Tar Heels just moved the line of scrimmage and Miami was attacking the wrong gaps, not fighting to get off its blocks.
 Williams and Carter have surged into my personal Top 100 2021 NFL Draft prospects with a strong season. On this particular run, Williams hurdles a defender, absorbs an attempted body blow and steals the soul of a defensive back coming up to make a tackle en route to a touchdown.

BRUSSELS - European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Monday he still has the firm belief that a Brexit trade agreement is possible, and whittled the outstanding disputes to be settled ahead of the New Year to just two.
 Barnier said that the nine-month negotiations had come down to finding settlements on fair-competition rules and fishing rights, no longer mentioning the issue of legal mechanisms for resolving future disputes that also long dogged the negotiations.
 “Two conditions are not met yet," he said as he entered a meeting to brief the 27 EU nations on progress in the talks. He is expected to continue negotiations with his U.K. counterpart David Frost later on Monday. “This deal, it is still possible," he added.
 Both sides are teetering on the brink of a no-deal Brexit departure, but have committed to a final push ahead of Jan. 1, when a transitional period following Britain's Jan. 31 departure from the bloc is to end.
 On Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ditched a self-imposed deadline and promised to “go the extra mile” to clinch a post-Brexit trade agreement that would avert New Year’s chaos and costs for cross-border commerce.
 Barnier is willing to accept British trade with no tariffs or quotas, but only if the U.K respects the rules and regulations that have made the EU's single market of almost 500 million consumers so successful. “Free and fair competition, fair and free, equitable and open, the two go together," Barnier said.
 Johnson, however, says he does not want British business to be hemmed in by EU restrictions, especially if those restrictions would have to be progressively adapted to mainland standards in the future.
 On fisheries, Barnier demanded “an agreement that guarantees a reciprocal, I insist, reciprocal access to markets and waters." It highlighted that just as EU fishermen crave to continue working in British waters, the U.K. seafood industry is extremely dependent on exports into the 27-nation bloc.

Aidan Wardell, 15, of Pittston, passed away Saturday, Dec. 12, 2020, in Gesinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center, Plains Twp.
 He was born in Pittston on Dec. 2, 2005 and was the son of Carina Fortina and Robert Wardell. Aidan was a member of Nativity Of Our Lord Parish Church, Duryea. He was a ninth grade freshman at Pittston Area High School. He was a diehard Seattle Seahawks fan, and loved playing his video games and building with Legos.
 Aidan had Ducheene Muscular Dystrophy, which is considered one of the most serious genetic diseases in children. He spent most of his life in a wheelchair. Aidan’s brother, Christopher, passed away of the same condition on June 26, 2018.
 Aidan and Christopher were close and shared remarkably similar traits. Like Christopher, Aidan was happy and his condition never hindered him from living an engaged and joyous life. Aidan had the rare capacity to make others feel good and to lift their spirits. In many ways, those who encountered him were made better in having met him. He had the capacity to lift others to higher ground. He was a bright light in a world so in need hope, optimism and inspiration. That said, Aidan missed the presence of his brother deeply.
 Just days prior to Aidan’s passing, his mother observed Aidan smiling while he was sleeping and even heard some laughter. When he woke, she mentioned this to him. Aidan told her that he was dreaming about Christopher and that in the dream, they were having fun together in heaven. A dream such as this could only be understood in the context of the closeness that Aidan and Christopher shared in this lifetime and now — together. To envision them reunited grants comfort to those that knew and loved both Aidan and Christopher.
 Every once in a while, someone is born and is meant to spend only a short time here. In such cases, the life lived — however brief — is lived so well that it has tremendous impact on everyone. It seems that Aidan was one such person. Only here for a short time, he had a great impact on so many — even strangers seemed to fall in love with him upon first meeting him. He was a rare treasure and he will be deeply missed.
 In addition to his brother, Christopher, he was preceded in death by his paternal grandmother, Florence Wardell.
 In addition to his parents, he is survived by his sister, Aliyah Gentner; his maternal grandparents, Karen and Eugene Fortini; uncles Eugene Fortini; his godfather and his wife, Alice and Robert Fortini; his aunts, Violet and Lisa Wardell; and uncles, James and Jeffrey Wardell. Also surviving is his godmother, Mary O’Brien Danaher; and several aunts, uncles and cousins.
 Memorial contributions may be made to Muscular Dystrophy Association, 222 S. Riverside Plaza, Suite 1500 Chicago, Illinois 60606.
 Funeral services will be privately held. Celebration of life services will be held at a later date.
 Arrangements are made by Kiesinger Funeral Services Inc., 255 McAlpine St., Duryea.
 Condolences may be made to www.kiesingerfuneralservices.com.

COURCHEVEL, France (AP) — An emotional Mikaela Shiffrin won her first World Cup ski race since the death of her father nearly a year ago. Shiffrin protected her first-run lead in Monday's giant slalom and finished 0.82 seconds ahead of Federica Brignone. Former world champion Tessa Worley was 1.09 behind in third place in the sun-splashed French Alps. It was Shiffrin's first victory since January -- one week before the death of her father. The American skier was at first subdued after crossing the line and seeing she had secured her 67th World Cup win. When Shiffrin’s name was announced over the loudspeakers at the post-race podium ceremony, she knelt in the snow and appeared to be sobbing. She conducted a television interview minutes later and initially was unable to compose her words. “It’s pretty hard to explain. Ninety-five percent of me felt that I couldn’t do it and then just a small bit of me at the right time and I was ...,” Shiffrin said, her words trailing away. “It’s crazy to be back here.” She was greeted in the finish area by Brignone, who won the overall World Cup title last season after Shiffrin stopped racing to be with her family in Colorado. Brignone was in third place after the morning run and had a fast second run going. After a mistake at a left-hand turn, she slid and recovered her balance with much of her left arm scraping the snow. Television microphones in the finish area picked up Brignone lamenting her “stupid” error. Marta Bassino’s bid for a third straight giant slalom victory ended when she skied out in her second run just before Shiffrin started. World Cup leader Petra Vlhova crashed in the morning run in a tricky section four gates from the finish. Shiffrin tied Marcel Hirscher for third on the all-time World...

Así lo dispuso el Ejecutivo tras aceptar las recomendaciones del Comité de Evaluación y Monitoreo del Programa de Asistencia de Emergencia al Trabajo y la Producción (ATP).
 De esta forma, determina que "se extiendan los beneficios del Programa ATP relativos al Salario Complementario, a la postergación y reducción del pago de las contribuciones patronales con destino al Sistema Integrado Previsional Argentino (SIPA) y al Crédito a Tasa Subsidiada, respecto de los salarios y contribuciones que se devenguen durante el mes de diciembre de 2020”.
 Además, estableció que “reciban el beneficio del Salario Complementario aquellas empresas que desarrollen alguna de las actividades incluidas en la nómina de las afectadas en forma crítica” a raíz de la pandemia.
 Asimismo, remarcó que “el salario neto resulta equivalente al 83% de la Remuneración Bruta devengada en el mes de noviembre de 2020, exteriorizada en la declaración jurada de aportes y contribuciones con destino a la seguridad social, correspondiente a dicho período”.
 Así se estableció que “el Salario Complementario a asignar como beneficio debe resultar equivalente al 50% del salario neto”, y agregó que “el resultado así obtenido no podrá ser inferior a la suma equivalente al salario mínimo vital y móvil ($ 20.588) ni superior a la suma equivalente a 1,3 SMVM ($ 26.764,4).
 Por último, se definió que “la suma del Salario Complementario no podrá arrojar como resultado que el trabajador obtenga un beneficio, por el concepto en trato, superior a su salario neto correspondiente a noviembre de 2020”.

In 2015, a marine biologist filmed her team removing a plastic straw from a sea turtle’s nostril. The video went viral, and a few years later, the global campaign to eliminate single-use plastics was in full swing. Companies like Starbucks, McDonald's, Evian, United Airlines, and even Red Lobster vowed to cut down on plastic waste. But even the most stringent anti-straw advocates among us know that sustainability has its limits. When it comes to the tools doctors use to poke, prod, test, and treat us with, human safety, not the safety of the planet, is paramount.

Her motives, however, are transparent, as are all of the other hearings, lawsuits and orchestrated attempts by President Donald Trump and some Republicans to uncover the fraud that isn’t there. Election officials, courts and straight-up facts all confirm the integrity of the election. Kiffmeyer even jumped onto the bandwagon late last week to try to get the Texas attorney general to add Minnesota to the list of states in his lawsuit before the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to overturn the results of the presidential election.
 Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, along with election officials across the country, worked diligently to ensure people could safely vote during the pandemic. Republicans are desperately trying to find holes in a system that was successful.
 Among Kiffmeyer’s concerns is that there were changes to rules for absentee balloting before the elections. As we’ve said all along, waiving the requirement of a witness signature made perfect sense during a pandemic when the safety of vulnerable voters was of utmost importance.

SAN FRANCISCO -- For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, San Francisco health care worker Charlotte Countee began feeling a sense of relief Sunday. Shipments of the new vaccine began arriving in California late Sunday night. Countee is a front line health care worker -- an employee of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Lately, she has been testing people for COVID-19. She and her colleagues have been worried for months not just about their own health, but also that of their patients. "It would be a great relief to be vaccinated, and be in the clear," she said. "I think treatment and care of patients would be better, because at this point we're all, you know, very very careful and very concerned and we can't get too close to patients, and I worry sometimes that that affects their care."

Many parts of the building are crumbling and the earthquake vulnerability of the area in Delhi makes a new, better-designed structure the need of the hour.

Of course, this guidance was ahead of the real outbreak of COVID-19 as the crisis hit the company hard. First-quarter sales fell 11% as COVID-19 only impacted the results late in the quarter. Second-quarter sales, when the crisis was in full swing, revealed a 35% decline in sales, as sales declines in the third quarter were far less pronounced at just 7%. While net debt has gradually been reduced to $2.36 billion, and the company has regained profitability after a tough second quarter, leverage ratios remain elevated.
 ## Some Thoughts
 While I have held a small long position since 2018, I must say that I am far from impressed with the performance; that is the understatement of the year. The company is not as good as I believed, or was led to be believed, as I have been disappointed many times in a row now.
 Truth be told is that leverage, revenues and earnings (excluding the impact of COVID-19) have not moved at all on a net-net basis over the past two years and change, quite disappointing.
 With shares dead flat without any dividends received in the meantime, there is not much to like on that side as well, as the truth is that the low interest rate environment is probably the reason why the shares are still trading at $50 here.
 Here and now I am holding a small position on the back of the relative value argument, although I no longer have conviction as I did in 2018, making me a happy seller on any rips from here.
