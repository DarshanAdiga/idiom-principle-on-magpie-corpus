Da quasi quarant'anni seguo Steve Wynn, mi vengono i brividi credetemi a digitare il suo nome perche lo amo follemente, in tutte le sue molteplici scorribande musicali. Decine e decine di lavori che appartengono al mio intelletto, al mio animo, che ho tatuato nel cuore, nel profondo dell'animo. Visto dal vivo in almeno sei occasioni, con tanto di autografi, di strette di mano, di sentiti ringraziamenti per quanto il ragazzo di Los Angeles e riuscito a trasmettere e a donare al ragazzo di Domodossola. Emozioni totali, uniche; chi come me ama la Musica capira benissimo.

You already know how much I love the Waterpik, so you can safely assume that I was extremely excited to learn that there is such a product as an electric toothbrush that is also a water flosser. I don't mean a water flosser that comes with an electric toothbrush -- I mean a water flosser that _is_ an electric toothbrush.
 My excitement quickly turned into exasperation when I ended up first spraying myself in the eye and then proceeded to spray water all over my bathroom mirror as I, in a frenzy, tried to turn the dang thing off. Don't make my mistake, folks. Just put the toothbrush in your mouth before turning the Waterpik feature on.
 Aside from the initial downturn, I enjoyed my experience with the Waterpik Sonic-Fusion Toothbrush. It's a bit awkward to use the Waterpik feature at first, as the brush must be connected to the tube through which water flows. Once you find the sweet spot on your bathroom counter, though, it won't be an issue.
 In terms of the cleaning power, I liked the Sonic-Fusion just as well as the Waterpik Complete Care, but in terms of design, the Complete Care is easier to use than the Sonic-Fusion. If you have enough space on your bathroom counter, I'd recommend the Complete Care over the Sonic-Fusion. But if you're in tight quarters or want to travel with a water flosser and electric toothbrush, the Sonic-Fusion is a great option.

The economy isn't going to bounce back quickly on its own from the coronavirus pandemic. State reopenings, premature or not, will restore a modicum of economic activity, but it won't be enough to put many local businesses in the black. If the virus comes roaring back in states that reopen, it will cause a wave of fear that will depress demand and send some places back into lockdown. Meanwhile, wary consumers are saving their money, which will depress demand. And global trade networks and supply chains will remain in shambles for some time as the pandemic reverberates around the world. Meanwhile, although the pace of unemployment claims has slowed slightly, millions of Americans continue to lose their jobs.

 "Where’s my mask?" my husband interrupts.
 "I’ll call you back," I tell my sister. "Your brother-in-law is getting ready for office."
 "Oh, essential service. No stay-at-home. Lucky man," she laughs.
 I hang up and help find his mask.
 Socks in the blue box. Masks in the black. How difficult is that to remember? I grumble to myself.
 "Take the blue striped. It will go with your shirt," I tell him when he picks a black one. "And here is your lunch and sanitiser bottle." I hand him both in a freshly washed cloth bag.
 "Enjoy your WFH," he says stepping out.
 "With ever-hungry kids, a slow Internet and a never-ending job list, that is a tall order," I say.
 I close the door behind him and start my daily disinfecting routine. Light switches, door handles, key boards...
 "Aren’t you being a bit paranoid," asks my son watching me clean the buttons on the remote with a baby cotton bud.
 "I wouldn’t have been, if you guys were more responsible. Look at this," I show him the greasy fingerprints on the remote.
 "Amma, I have my Zoom classes now. Can you guys keep your voices down?" the younger one bursts into the room munching on something. "And please don’t barge into my room without knocking."
 "By the way, did you wash your hands properly before snacking on that thing," I ask her.
 "Yep. You don't have to ask me that all the time. I am not in kindergarten, you know," she says.
 "She did, Amma. I heard her singing happy birthday twice. It was hilarious." My son guffaws and she stomps off to her room.
 "Sabjiwala is here." I get a notification from my housing society’s WhatsApp group. I look at the clock. I have been assigned the 9 to 9.30 slot. Ten people at a time.
 I mask up and walk down three flights of stairs to join the queue. At the landing, a man in a tracksuit runs past me, keeping no distancing whatsoever. What a nerve! I flap my hands in the air, almost involuntarily, as if to chase off any germs that might have rolled off him.
 In the apartment compound, the queue looks longer than I expected. There are more than the permitted 10 people. Someone waves at me. Is it my next-door neighbour or the one from the other block? With the distance and the mask, it's difficult to tell.
 By the time I reach the front of the queue, there is hardly any good stuff left. Dejected, I climb the three flights back home to find the children watching TV, the volume set high. "The teacher’s Wi-Fi isn't working. So class cancelled," my daughter tells me happily.
 "You can finish your class projects then," I tell her, removing my mask and breathing freely.
 "No. We are watching Contagion. It’s about this deadly virus," she says enthusiastically.
 "Why do you want to watch it now? It's scary, as it is," I tell her.
 "We are mentally preparing for the worst," the elder one laughs.
 "It’s no laughing matter. People are dying, you know." I express my disagreement on the matter.
 "Come on, Amma. Take it easy. The virus is going to be here for a long time. We will lose our sanity if we are serious and scared all the time. Let us stay positive and learn to live with it," he says sagely.
 I am impressed. "You’re right. There is no point in worrying. Let us stay positive. Maybe we should do something productive. Together. Like cooking. What do you say?" I am super thrilled.
 "Hmm… I don't know," he shrugs.
 "Come on. Cooking is a life skill. It will be useful for you in the future as well, like when you stay in a hostel. Let us do it. Today." I get carried away and jot down in my mind a list of things to make.
 "Maybe tomorrow, Amma. I have to finish my project first," the younger one says, scooting off to her room. "I too have an assignment to do," says the elder and disappears.
 "Let us do it tomorrow then," I shout after them. I wait for an answer, but all I could hear is the sound of doors being shut.
 As I log on to my office’s website and get ready for WFH, I feel strangely relieved that at least some things are still the old normal.

After three events on the Kansas Crappie Trail this season, a logjam exists at the top of the 2020 season points race, with four teams from across Kansas and Missouri within two points of one another.
   
 Mike and Eric Schrock, of Lawrence, finished in third with 11.95 pounds on May 23 at Melvern Reservoir to settle into a tie at 292 points at the top of the season standings alongside fifth-place finishers Frank Haidusek, of Riley, and Dalton Thomas, of Leavenworth, who posted the second-largest fish of the day at 2.13 pounds and had a bag of 11.77 pounds.
   
 Meanwhile, Kalin Caton, of Kansas City, Mo., and Wichita's Derek Kruger ended up winning the Melvern event by nearly a half-pound, weighing 12.47 pounds to settle into sixth in the season standings at 277 points.
   
 "Well we didn't really know the lake hardly at all," Caton said. "But found a spot the weekend before and just kinda stuck with it and said we were gonna stick to that one area. We just found the big ones with LiveScope and focused on chasing them down."
   
 Kruger said the team had about a week before the tournament to try to figure out a game plan.
   
 "Found a lot of fish suspended in deeper water, but they were mainly small fish," Kruger said. "So we moved into shallow water and caught one 'tournament fish' and decided that's where we would spend the day Saturday.
   
 "We knew the level of competition was extremely high, with some state and nationally known crappie fisherman that I have a ton of respect for. That's why when we had a good bag of fish very early in the day, there was no sense of relief. Any one of those guys could have been up there, too. Just happened to be our day."
   
 KCT organizer Dylan Faulconer, of Eudora, and teammate Allen Miller, of Baldwin City, finished second at Melvern with 11.98 pounds and currently sit fourth in the season-long race at 290 points, settled behind Melvern's sixth- place finishers Tony Niemeyer, of Gardner, and Ryan German, of Louisburg, (11.51 pounds, 291 season points), who sit in a close third in the points standings after previously sharing the lead with Haidusek and Thomas.
   
 If it sounds like it's anyone's race to win at this point, that's because it is.
   
 Topekan Brandon Manis and Nic Luttman, of Meriden, round out the top five in the season standings after a seventh-place finish at Melvern (11.38 pounds). Manis and Luttman won the previous event May 9 on El Dorado with a 14.41-pound, seven-fish bag, and sit just seven points back of the lead spot in the standings.
   
 But it wasn't just about the points race, as several other anglers had excellent days on Melvern.
   
 Another notable finisher at Melvern was Crappie Masters owner/president Mike Vallentine, of Clinton, Mo., who took fourth on the day with 11.92 pounds. This year marks the KCT's first season under the Crappie Masters umbrella.
   
 Rookies Jeff Dick and Johnny Faith, who had until that point failed to make a splash on the trail, posted the big fish for the event with a 2.4-pound slab and managed to turn in an eight-place finish with a bag of 11 pounds even. Twenty-two teams competed in the event, making for a fairly large field. Nine of the top 10 teams finished with 10-plus pounds.
   
 In the Top Secret Jig Co. Rookie Team of the Year standings, 12th-place finishers Bob Purh and Jeremy Conway (7.58 pounds) maintain a sizable lead with 271 points over Craig Schmitt and Jennifer Haskins (258 points), who finished 16th at Melvern with 7.16 pounds. Dick and Faith now sit third in the rookie standings at 182 points after their top-10 finish and big fish gave them a one-point edge over Mike Rogers and Jim Doolittle.
   
 The next regularly scheduled KCT event is set for June 13 on Perry Reservoir. Registration begins at 5 a.m., with a $100 entry fee per two-person team. Takeoff will be at roughly 6 a.m. Best seven alive fish are weighed during the 2:30 p.m. weigh-in. For more information, contact Dylan Faulconer at KansasCrappieTrail@yahoo.com or 913-416-3481.

Lega Serie A has decided the season will recommence with the four outstanding games in hand on the weekend of June 20-21, with the Coppa Italia final confirmed for June 17.
 Italy's top tier was on Thursday given the green light to return, as sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora announced the intention is to resume the fixtures from June 20.
 During his statement, Spadafora confirmed the Coppa Italia would take place the week before, though no specific dates were set for the last three matches – the two semi-finals and the showpiece.
 But a Lega Serie A statement released on Friday said there was a unanimous agreement that the remaining games in hand from matchday 25 will go ahead on the first weekend.
 It was also confirmed the Coppa Italia final shall be played on June 17, though dates for the semi-finals are still to be determined.
 The statement read: "The assembly of Lega Serie A met today [Friday] in the presence of all 20 associated clubs in a video conference.
 "The clubs welcomed the green light to the return of Serie A communicated yesterday by minister Spadafora and unanimously voted on the dispute of the four matches of the 25th matchday (Atalanta v Sassuolo, Hellas Verona v Cagliari, Inter v Sampdoria and Torino v Parma) on the weekend of June 20-21 and the planning of matchday 27 starting from Monday, June 22.
 "Furthermore, welcoming the wish of minister Spadafora, the sporting activity of the 2019-2020 season will resume immediately with the Coppa Italia, of which the final is scheduled for June 17.
 "Dates and times of the matches will be announced by Lega Serie A in the coming days."
 Juventus were a point clear of Lazio at the top of the table with 12 games remaining when the league season was suspended in March.
 They were due to face Milan in the second leg of the Coppa semi-final in Turin on March 4, with the first leg having finished 1-1.
 The other semi-final was also finely poised, with Napoli 1-0 up against Inter ahead of their second leg at the San Paolo.

 We ran for our life towards the exit gates where two security personnel stopped us and wanted to know what we were fleeing from. "Haven’t you heard the big noise? Something terrible has happened to the dam. I think it buckled under the pressure of the water it is holding back. The wall of water will bounce up on us soon like million tigers," my brother said.
 The security men burst into laughter and told us that the noise came not from the dam bursting but from a fighter plane that tore through the tranquil midday sky. These planes were coming from the Air Force Station at Sulur.
 "When they flew above Mettur first time, we too thought that something happened to our dam and scurried here and there like scared hares. We calmed down only after confirmation came from our higher-ups," a uniformed man said.

A deafening noise jolted Bangaluru recently. The dwellers of the Silicon City let their imaginations run riot on the cause of the scary noise. Some thought it came from an alien spacecraft. There were others who thought it came from under the earth or from an asteroid that crashed into our planet.
 Even before I read in the paper that a fighter aircraft of the Indian Air Force was the source of the noise that shook the capital city of Karnataka, I knew what actually was behind it since my brother and I had a more or less similar experience 43 years ago.
 I was visiting Mettur where my brother was working in a factory. When we were having a blissful siesta on a bench under a tree in the park at the foot of the mighty Mettur dam, after an hour-long tour of the site, a thunderous noise woke us up violently. Though words fail me to describe it right, it was like the sky being torn off into two halves pole to pole. We just jumped to the conclusion that the dam brimming with water to its full capacity had burst and we would be carried away at lightning speed by the rushing, roaring monstrous, angry waters all the way to our home town of Srirangam.
