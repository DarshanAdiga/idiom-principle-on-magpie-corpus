But it's Grant who makes the strongest argument for watching what is, outside of the acting and the top-shelf wealth porn (Grace's outerwear budget alone must rival New York City's median annual income), a pretty mediocre show. He imbues Jonathan with the same witty, self-deprecating charm that made the actor such a sensation in the romantic comedies of the '90s--not to mention got Grant off the hook with the public after a deeply unromantic 1995 arrest, in time to make the prototypical rom-com of the era, 1999's _Notting Hill_. All the layers of his image are present in this performance, one that understands the effect Grant has on audiences and so seduces us just as it does Grace. Jonathan might be a classic, caddish but ultimately lovable Hugh Grant character, the kind whose flaws are limited to philandering. Then again, he might be a much darker sort of man who's deceiving his family with an extremely convincing Hugh Grant act.

From the LOS ANGELES TIMES
 THE INTERNET has been a powerful source of innovation and opportunity in the half-century since the first electronic message was sent between experimental nodes at UCLA and Stanford. And in some industries, it remains a great equalizer — giving upstart creators and service providers the sort of access that used to be the exclusive province of big corporations.
 That’s why policymakers in the United States have been loath to intervene online, worried that any rules they set would be counterproductive or quickly rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of change. “Don’t regulate the internet” became a frequent rallying cry, and for the most part, lawmakers and governmental agencies handled the emerging online powerhouses with kid gloves.
 The gloves have now officially come off. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a much-anticipated lawsuit Tuesday accusing Google of abusing its dominant position in online search and advertising to cement its market power. The lawsuit, which was joined by 11 state attorneys general, is likely to be just the first in a salvo of antitrust cases, legislative proposals, rule-makings and other governmental initiatives to rein in Big Tech companies.
 We won’t prejudge the Justice Department’s allegations that Google unfairly blocked competitors and raised the cost of online advertising to the detriment of consumers across the country. But we can’t help but notice the similarities between the case against Google and the Justice Department’s successful antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in the late 1990s, when the software giant used its deals with computer manufacturers for the Windows operating system to impede competition in the emerging areas of web browsers and digital media players.
 According to the Justice Department’s complaint, Google has used exclusive contracts with manufacturers and mobile phone services to make sure Google would be the default search service on browsers and mobile devices, and to guarantee that its apps would be placed prominently on products’ screens. This conduct led it to control more than 90% of the searches, the complaint alleges, while also buttressing its dominant position in online advertising.
 Google defended its actions and argued that consumers are free to choose other services for their searches.
 The lesson of the Microsoft case that seems apt here is not that it’s illegal to be big and successful. It is that once a company reaches that pinnacle, the aggressive tactics it used to grow and succeed can no longer be used to maintain its dominance. Monopolies aren’t necessarily illegal — efforts to preserve them are.
 That’s why antitrust authorities at the state and federal level are also scrutinizing Facebook, which has a track record of trying to gobble up or crush companies that could compete with its social network, and Amazon, which has been accused of competing unfairly with the many small and midsize businesses that sell products and services through its platform. Apple has come under the microscope too even though its products aren’t the top sellers in any category; its critics say the company is extracting unfairly high fees from the companies that want to make and sell apps for Apple’s iPhones and iPads.
 For Big Tech, it’s a reckoning that’s been a long time coming. The internet is still capable of supporting vigorous competition and a free-flowing exchange of ideas, and rapidly changing technology still has the potential to disrupt markets and topple once-dominant corporations. But as much as lawmakers and regulators need to keep those realities in mind, they also need to make sure dominant companies don’t leverage their power to choke off competition and leave consumers with too few good alternatives and too little innovation.

And for the space of this movie, the city of New York is both theirs and ours. Coppola and cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd show us a place that's half real and half dreamy, a kind of early-Woody Allen-style reverie without any of Allen's bitterness. By day, even the ordinary sights Laura passes as she's zipping about--drugstores and dry-cleaners, bodegas and shoe-repair shops-- glow with workaday vitality. At night, the city lights splash out in Jolly Rancher colors. At one point Felix whisks Laura off to the Bemelmans Bar for a drink: the walls, painted in soft tones with rabbits going about their anthropomorphic business, with schoolchildren lined up for an outing, with well-groomed gents lounging on park benches, form a kind of cozy jewel box, only it's a jewel box for people. The New York of _On the Rocks_ is a place where you can feel both special and lonely, with no contradiction between the two. It's a place that always has you stretching toward something just out of reach, until you realize that the life you have in your hands, with all its random bumps and shaggy edges, is the treasure of real value.

Wasps' front row has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak that threatened their involvement in Saturday's Premiership final against newly crowned European champions Exeter.
 Props Kieran Brookes and Simon McIntyre are among four players ruled out of the climax to the English season due to contact-tracing protocols. Tom West and Jeff Toomaga-Allen take their places in the team announced on Friday.
 Number eight Brad Shields also misses out after seven players returned positive tests for Covid-19, so Tom Willis plugs the gap in the back row.
 Hooker Alfie Barbeary's hopes of securing a bench role for the Twickenham showdown have also been dashed.
 In total there are four changes to the starting XV that thumped Bristol 47-24 in the semi-final, the last of them coming in the midfield as part of an otherwise unchanged backline.
 Big hitting centre Malakai Fekitoa has lost his battle with a groin injury, so Juan de Jongh slots in at 13.
 "If we are all being honest, it hasn't been ideal preparation, but I have to give credit to the players because they have coped with it admirably," said head coach Lee Blackett.
 "A lot of credit must also go to the staff. The amount of work that they have put in behind the scenes to allow us to play in this game is phenomenal."
 "We know it will be tough," he added. "Exeter deservedly finished top of the league this season, but we are confident with the form that we can take into the game."
 Exeter boss Rob Baxter has made a number of changes to his winning European formula ahead of their fifth successive appearance in the end-of-season decider.
 Up front, Sam Skinner takes over from his Scottish international team-mate Jonny Gray, while Jannes Kirsten is preferred to compatriot Jacques Vermeulen in the back-row.
 Behind them, Ollie Devoto comes into the centre alongside Henry Slade, while Olly Woodburn is given the nod over Tom O’Flaherty on the right wing.
 Baxter said his players had been restrained in the celebrations after beating Racing 92 last week to be crowned kings of Europe for the first time.
 "All of us know there was another game to go, so it’s important that the sacrifices they and their families have made over these weeks and months, are now made worthwhile, by turning up and performing well this weekend," he said.
 "They have down time coming up and they can celebrate afterwards, but the key thing for me -- and I’ve said it to the lads -- is that they can enjoy it all by playing well this weekend. I’d love for them to round off their season in a special way by producing one of those big Exeter-type performances."

CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) — A Corvallis woman pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide on Thursday in Polk County Circuit Court for a 2019 car crash that killed her teenage daughter.
 Kayla Carter also pleaded guilty for third-degree assault and no contest to driving under the influence of intoxicants, The Gazette-Times reported.
 Carter, with her 13-year-old daughter in the passenger seat of her car, ran a stop sign at an intersection on March 16, 2019, documents said. Her vehicle collided with car heading north on the highway.
 Brianna Carter was pronounced dead at the scene. Jessica Cornett of Bend, the driver of the other car, was injured.
 According to court documents, Carter’s blood alcohol content was found to be approximately .059% by Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center staff in Corvallis.
 “Ms. Carter’s pleas today are a compromise,” her lawyer Mike Flinn wrote in an email to the Gazette-Times. “She had viable defenses to each of the crimes alleged, and we believe the District Attorney’s office would have had a difficult time convincing a jury that there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that these crimes occurred. However, there are always risks in going to trial.”
 As part of the deal, charges of second-degree manslaughter and second-degree criminal mischief were dismissed. Sentencing was set for December.

It’s been awhile since I’ve written from this perspective, and man we could discuss a plethora of different topics. First off, I might be the happiest man in the world that sports have returned. My life doesn’t revolve around sports, but it might as well. It’s good seeing the Cats thump Tennessee, and yes, my Steelers are undefeated for all my Bengals fans reading. Our Clay County teams are having success as well, as sports are still underway in Kentucky (for now).
 Despite the return of sports, one thing that’s really been on my mind though is how our community needs us all right now. I saw an issue this past week with a local business being talked about pretty roughly on Facebook. I get it, I do. I get sideways every time my order is wrong, something isn’t shipped right, or if anyone gives me problems in general I suppose. That being said, my problem lies with what seems to be an itch everyone needs to scratch, and that’s airing out their problems via Facebook.
 I’m so guilty of having done just that a million times and it’s making me laugh while typing it. However, why is it that when folks have a problem with someone, they can’t address it directly with whom or where the problem lies? Why does it have to begin with a hateful post, no doubt typed in anger before actually thinking “is this worth saying all this about” or feeling that upset over? Followed by the inevitable group of those who agree and bash as well in droves, making problems that much worse for whomever or whatever it’s directed at.
 We, as grown adults on Facebook and other forms of social media have to be better at how we address our problems. Bashing someone, or in this situation a local business on Facebook over a problem that could have been handled directly is just wrong. It’s wrong, simple as that. I’m guilty of it, and I wish I wasn’t.
 I would be willing to bet that roughly 99% of business owners in Manchester would be MORE than glad to help and alleviate you of any problem you may have with them, or their business. They depend on us, the community. More importantly, we the community depend on them! We rely on these hardworking folks who provide us with things that the majority take for granted until it’s gone.
 Thank our local business owners for all they do when you see them. If you have an issue with them, talk to them, face to face. They will no doubt correct the issue, and the world will be a better place for it. That’s all I’ve got for this week, hope to write to you all again soon!

That was just one of several headaches as Leeds were pipped to second place by Sheffield United in 2018/19. Setbacks were something of a theme that season.
 Bielsa was more fortunate in the subsequent Championship-winning 2019/20 campaign, with a core of dependable players available throughout, but it wasn’t without its problems - not least the season-ending hip problem that befell Adam Forshaw, who looked a vital presence in midfield as Leeds made a stellar start.
 United have shown remarkable resilience and adaptability to deal with their injury setbacks in recent seasons, with the emergence of “positional Polyfilla” Stuart Dallas as an all-round utility gap-plugger last season testament to that.
 It’s what Liverpool will need to do this season if they’re to have any hope of lifting a second successive Premier League trophy next summer, but the injury to Van Dijk is a particularly costly one: a game-changer after his club-record £75million transfer from Southampton in January 2018.
 The Netherlands international’s impact was immediate, transforming a sketchy and questionable defence to that with the best record in England over the past two and a half seasons.
 He was a near ever-present as the Reds reached back-to-back Champions League finals, winning the second in 2019, and a combined 195 points over the last Premier League two seasons - starting all 76 games during that relentless run.

Klopp isn’t blessed with a great deal of depth in the centre-half department, and has been left rearranging his pieces, with nominal No.6 Fabinho dropping into the backline and others having to step into his place at the base of midfield.
 It’s a similar story for Bielsa at Leeds, albeit in the inverse, with Forshaw still sidelined for the foreseeable future and more centre-halves needed to play further up, as Ben White did when Phillips was out last season.
 In his pre-match press conference, the manager _confirmed_ that Pascal Struijk would step up in his place.
 The 21-year-old _evidently has his coach’s trust_, but he has only made two senior starts in that position to date - both of which came after the Championship title had been secured last season. This is a big step for him - and only time will tell if he’s ready.
 Encouragingly for United, the record without Phillips during Bielsa’s time in charge hasn’t been markedly worse, with a _rate of points per game with him at 1.89 falling marginally to 1.84 without_.

Still, for long stretches, there was only solitude.
 Which, by the way, is what Jimmy intended.
 “In light of the social movements that are going on all over the country — that are going on in sports — the whole notion of trying to tackle these distances all alone, it kind of resonated with me,” he said. “Because as much as social movements are collective, just like a normal Ironman race would be a collective movement of 2,000 people participating, those sort of struggles, ultimately, we face them alone.
 “You can be in a race with 2,000 athletes to the finish of that 140.6 miles, but ultimately that struggle is just you — just you and that isolated shell of yourself. As much as these social movements are collective, every one of us is laying in bed at the end of the night by ourselves, just thinking about it and working our way through it.”

The win ratio at Liverpool when Van Dijk has started has been 70.5%, but that falls to just 42.9% when he’s not (all competitions since he was signed).
 There’s an argument that the closest equivalent in terms of importance at Leeds is academy graduate Kalvin Phillips. He’s been so central to the club’s recent success under Bielsa that he was handed his England debut before he’d even kicked a ball in the Premier League - a rare accolade.
 There’s been the odd knock or suspension keeping Phillips out, but by and large, he’s been a durable presence during the Bielsa era, starting 81 of 92 Championship games under him.
 Fortunately for Leeds, the shoulder injury that Phillips sustained in the 1-0 defeat by Wolves will see the 24-year-old out for a fraction of the time that Van Dijk is set to be sidelined for Liverpool, but up to six weeks without their midfield enforcer could have a similarly destabilising effect at a crucial juncture of the season.

What _The Silence_ is missing, like much of DeLillo’s work following his massive opus _Underworld_ , is the heaviness of history. For years, his novels seemed to be reckoning with the past, ruptures in history that opened up violent and beguiling possibilities: the JFK assassination, toxic pollution, terrorism. Since _The Body Artist_ , his 2001 novella, the writing has retreated inward. When it looks outside itself, it’s toward an ambiguous future. If it’s salvageable depends on how closely your internal voice aligns with the author. But _The Silence_ is doing something different, and maybe represents another shift. It feels more explicitly of the current moment, or maybe the times have just caught up with DeLillo. We’re finally ready for what he has been saying all along.

Harrison School Superintendent Dr. Stewart Pratt gave the Board of Education some COVID-19 update information Tuesday night, and he indicated some changes could be forthcoming.
 On the whole, Pratt said the district sees about 65-75 students quarantined each week as a result of exposure to the novel coronavirus. Out of them, between six and 10 actually test positive on average.
 At the elementary level, students are counseled to return to school if at all possible. Each plant might have different numbers, but Pratt estimated about 10 or less haven’t returned because parents are resistant to let them.
 Those administrators have been given authority to speak in a direct fashion to those parents to get their children back in school.
 “This is their learning,” Pratt said. “This is long term. It’s going to have lasting effects if we don’t bring them back.”
 Pratt said that a child who is off-site and performing well, the district won’t try to force them back into the classroom. More pressure could be applied to those who have multiple Fs in classes.
 At the middle school level, there are about 10-15 in grades 5 and 6 students who need to return to campus, while that number is 15-20 in grades 7 and 8. Those are averages that fluctuate.
 Staff are working with parents to get those children back to school. The numbers change with upper grades when parents are a little less in control of older children, he said.
 At the high school level, there had been about 170 students in the off-site model and some 115 or so had one or more Fs. Principal Jay Parker has been working to get those students back on track as quickly as possible. Pratt admitted that pressure is put on both students and parents.
 “I’m not going to shy away from that,” Pratt said. “These students are in peril. They’re on the track for graduation and they may not make it. If we don’t do something now, they may not make it, especially if COVID sticks around.”
 Pratt said there are students at every level who are prospering with the off- site model, which is something he thinks could be around for years to come.
 He said at least 30 high school students have returned to campus and administration continues to work to capture more.
 Still, he said some students have gone into the workforce. He said he is supportive of the community and businesses. But any business is asked to reconsider hiring such students if they are missing all their classes to work.
 “Because education is more important than that minimum wage job right now,” Pratt said.
 If any business has a student working, supervisors can request their grades and encourage them to go back to school.
 As far as staff, there is an average about three to seven quarantined each week, but less than four actually test positive.
 Teachers feel they need more preparation time with all the added work. One of the elementary plants made some adjustments to the way on-site and off-site learning is delivered and that has provided some relief to teachers.
 Feedback from teachers in K-4 has shown they want as much time as possible to be with students.
 At the middle school level, teachers face more stress in balancing the on-site and off-site students. So, they need more preparation and have asked for one day a week to be virtual learning only in order to catch up.
 At the high school level, teachers are frustrated with those students who are disengaged, so they are concentrating on getting them back to campus.
 The balance between off-site and on-site is more difficult at the high school level. Grading lessons is different for teacher. On-site lessons are all turned in at the same time, while off-site lessons come in at various times. It takes longer and requires more prep time.
 To get feedback, the district has been having meetings with some teachers and staff from different plants. They have had healthy discussions, although they might not agree with each other on all points, as to what direction the district needs to go moving forward. PTA leadership was also brought in for input.
 All that input led to a realization.
 “The model we’re in is unsustainable,” Pratt said. “And we’re not providing the education we can provide without some change in the way we deliver.”
 Parents were polled at the beginning of the school year and 85% said they wanted to see school held five days a week. They need to go to work and childcare would be a major challenge.
 So, Pratt said, administration will be making a recommendation in November to offer a compromise between teachers and parents.
 As of Tuesday night, that recommendation looks to be early dismissal at 2 p.m. each Monday beginning in the new year. “Stewart Pratt hopes that never goes away,” he said.
 Parents will be provided with more information next month about what to do for childcare. He plans to perform some community Zoom meetings for parents to offer input.
 That schedule would also give teachers some time — they work until 3:30 p.m. — to get caught up on issues that need more attention.
 Although the compromise doesn’t meet all requirements of all teachers and even parents, it’s a matter of the future.
 “The purpose of what we’re doing can’t be just for COVID,” Pratt said. “It’s for what’s best for the district in the long run to make learning masterful and get the best product for our kids every year for years to come when Stewart Pratt’s not here and many of these boards aren’t here.”

Laura knows better than to confess that apprehension to Felix, who has just swept into town, his big personality in tow. He and Laura's mother have been long divorced, and late in the film, we get some sense of the pain he caused when he cracked the family apart. But his love for Laura is never in doubt. When, even against her better judgment, she confides her troubles to him, he peppers her with unwanted advice. "You need to start thinking like a man," he tells her. She responds with an eye roll that suggests she's seen it all, though she never lets him off the hook. Her skepticism about his crazy disco- ball worldview is part of their dynamic, and he clearly loves it. Felix specializes in outlandish pronouncements about romantic relationships: as the two sit down for lunch at a fancy gentleman's club, he offers an especially amusing, if chauvinistic, explanation of how the fair sex came to be attractive to men. (A chief factor is their lack of facial hair.) When he steers the conversation off-course, or toward himself, which is often--"Did I ever tell you about the Rockette I dated?"--Laura tugs him back like an ace shepherd retrieving a wayward sheep. But while Laura only has a vague fear that Dean might be cheating on her, Felix is so protective that he immediately assumes the worst. His best quality is also his worst; he ends up sweeping Laura further into a cobwebby corner of doubt, rather than helping her see her way out.

“Oklahoma, we have to find a path forward, and we have to do it together,” Stitt said, adding that he represents 4 million Oklahomans and 39 federally recognized tribes.
 “One set of rules is essential to us becoming a top 10 state,” he said. “Can you imagine what would happen over the next 113 years if we had 39 different sets of rules?”
 The state spends millions on roads and bridges and to educate children in eastern Oklahoma. Tribal citizens benefit from health care programs and unemployment benefits, he said.
 Stitt did not directly answer a question about whether he foresees a day when the state would stop funding bridges and schools located on eastern Oklahoma’s reservation lands.
 Oklahoma Tax Commission, though, estimates “a significant immediate and ongoing fiscal impact” resulting from the expanded Muscogee (Creek) Nation boundaries, according to a report published earlier this year.
 They estimate a $21.5 million impact from tribal income exclusion by Creek Nation members, and a revenue impact of $64.5 million for tribal refund claims for the 2017-19 tax years.
 If McGirt also is expanded to the Chickasaw, Cherokee, Choctaw and Seminole tribes, the per-year revenue impact would grow to $72.7 million. And, there would be an additional $218.1 million impact on refund claims, tax officials said.
 The state also would see reduced sales/use tax collections by Creek Nation tribal members of $38.1 million a year. If the ruling is also expanded to the four other tribes, there is a potential impact of $132.2 million a year, officials said.
 Officials did not say what impact the ruling would have on property tax payments, which help fund local services and schools.
 “All Oklahomans deserve to have equal access to the benefits and services that Oklahoma offers,” Stitt said. “That also means we should share the responsibility to fund these services. The questions caused by the McGirt decision [have] put our state at major crossroads.”
 Stitt said he looks forward to working with tribal leaders and the federal congressional delegation to sort through the issues.
 Without federal legislation to give state leaders guidance, there will be tremendous uncertainty and years of endless litigation, he said.

Orange County metrics have been quite consistent over the past month in the red tier range, but not qualifying for orange. The difference between our current metrics and the requirements for the yellow tier require a substantial decrease in disease burden, which is difficult to achieve during the best-case scenario timeframe.”
