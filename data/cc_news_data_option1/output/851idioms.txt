High Speed Doors are door systems, mainly used in industrial applications. They are technical enhancements of the generally known sectional doors, PVC fabric doors or roller shutters. The main difference is that the durable construction provides a higher operating speed and they are able to sustain a higher number of cycles (opening and closing cycles) and require lower maintenance and repair cost. The speed can reach 4.0 m and beyond per second. Depending on the intended field of application, horizontal or vertical operating door types are available. They reduce to the maximum air currents and losses of ambient temperatures, and they make the intense flow of people and vehicles easier.

Before the game started on Sunday, two teams were apart by just two points at the top of the La Liga table. Barcelona were hoping to increase the gap to five points or at least keep the status quo whereas Real were hoping to overtake their rivals and take their destiny in their own hands. After successfully beating their arch-rivals, Los Blancos have now secured a one- point lead over Barca with just 12 matchdays to go. However, Real’s form this season will give Barcelona a lot of hope and therefore, football fans should embrace themselves to watch the La Liga title race going all the way down to the wire.

She is said to have fled her country five years ago after the police found her in bed with another woman. Not only that, she was forced into marriage with an abusive husband, she has a young daughter she left behind (read deserted), and she was raped by two men in an act of what South Africans call corrective rape.

DUBAI -- The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Monday it was working with Lebanon's central bank to ensure revenues of non-Lebanese airlines continue to be repatriated despite restrictions on currency transfers abroad.


  Airline revenues are still flowing out of the crisis-hit country but transfers are becoming difficult, IATA's Vice President for Africa and the Middle East Muhammad Ali Albakri told a news conference.


  A foreign currency liquidity crunch has forced banks in Lebanon to impose tight restrictions on access to hard currency and sending money abroad, and the Lebanese pound has slumped.


  "We continue to work with the Lebanese government, we continue to work with the Lebanese central bank … it is difficult but it is still flowing," he said. "The distribution system is still working."


  Albakri, speaking in the United Arab Emirates' capital Abu Dhabi, said he hopes IATA would not have to put Lebanon on its list of countries that block funds being repatriated.


  "The country understands - the decision makers, the government - how vital air connectivity is to Lebanon especially in this difficult political time, and they are doing everything in their power to make sure that is not disrupted," he said.


  Tourism has traditionally been an important part of the Lebanese economy, which is mired in its worst crisis since the 1975-90 war.


  That came to a head last year as capital flows into the country slowed down and protests erupted against a political elite over decades of corruption and bad governance. (Reporting by Alexander Cornwell; Writing by Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Alison Williams and Jan Harvey)

Republicans Cap Fendig and Mike Haugen have announced intentions to vie for the District 2 seat, while Bo Clark and Walter Rafolski, also Republicans, have said they intend to pursue the at-large seat.


  In District 1, Sammy Tostensen announced in January that he would challenge Browning in the Republican general primary.


  Booker, a Democrat, has no declared opposition.


  District Attorney Jackie Johnson, a Republican, is also facing reelection. The only one to announce a candidacy against her is Keith Higgins, an independent.


  On the Glynn County Board of Education, seats held by Democrat Linda Bobbitt and Republicans Marcus Edgy, John Madala and Jerry Mancil — representing districts 5, 1, 3 and At-large Post 2, respectively — will be on the ballot.


  One at-large position on the Brunswick-Glynn County Joint Water and Sewer Commission is open and will be on the ballot. Steve Copeland, elected to the seat in 2016, stepped down late last year.


  A Glynn County grand jury is expected to appoint a replacement next month to serve until the election.


  Four of the five Glynn County Superior Court Judges — Stephen Scarlett, Stephen Kelley, Anthony Harrison and Bert Guy — and State Court Judge Bart Altman are up for reelection as well.


  Other positions that will be on the ballot include:


  • Glynn County Probate Court judge, currently held by Debra Godwin Duncan.


  • State Court clerk, held by Brenda Boone-Cove.


  • Glynn County Superior Court clerk, held by Ron Adams.


  • Glynn County sheriff, held by Neal Jump.


  • Glynn County tax commissioner, held by Jeff Chapman.


  • Glynn County coroner, held by Marc Neu.


  • Glynn County Magistrate Court judge, held by Wallace Harrell.


  • State Court solicitor, held by Maria Lugue.

For years, jezail.org has been under persistent attacks by various players because we will never stop pointing to this and other fantasy aspects of virtually all elements of US foreign policy thinking in the region. We have also been critical of the Kabul government fantasies about what to expect from Washington. In keeping with this tradition, we wish to highlight that the expendable nature of the Kabul government has also been revealed by this agreement. This should have been clear from the moment the US forbade Kabul from talking to their neighbors in Iran. Really, it should have been obvious from the Bonn agreement. We have exposed American policy indicators repeatedly over many years in the many stories we have published. We have long covered the lack of serious commitment on the part of the US to build an effective army or government in Afghanistan. From the construction of dysfunctional hospitals to aircraft and military support failures and rackets to rigged elections, the American objective in Kabul was never to support the regime while to cosmetically appearing to. Make no mistake: it was never because they weren’t able to; it was always because they didn’t want to. The money and bets placed by US diplomatic officials on the region were always on Pakistan and never on Afghanistan. That’s where their jobs, patronage, grants, board memberships and careers have been anchored for 50 years. The money was in Pakistan, not Afghanistan. A free standing Afghanistan, able to govern itself and defend its own borders was simply not the goal of the US foreign policy establishment. They said the exact opposite. They lied. They predictably failed to deliver at every stage over at least the last twenty years. The real and unspoken assumption of the US foreign policy establishment was that sooner or later, Pakistan was going to swallow up or annex all or some of Afghanistan and dominate it. This had been a subject discussed at American diplomatic cocktail parties since the mid 1960’s. Afghanistan was always meant to fall in Pakistan’s lap like a ripe fruit. That, in itself was meant to be a payoff. To that extent, US State Department officials invented the myth of a Pakistani alliance which they knew was a lie too. Behind the scenes, they always advocated placing portfolio and career bets on Pakistan while paying lipservice to the dream of Afghanistan. Unfortunately, because so much of Afghan life is in a dream world all its own, many Afghans bought the story or were forced to accept it. The entire episode can be characterized as a blood soaked collective hallucination. It was also a collection of war crimes unthinkable to American military professionals before 911.

If that’s enough, congratulations, you made it! If you want to push further, continue with this approach. Identify your new goal, then break it down into incremental steps you know you can stick with. Track your progress, and when you hit a milestone, celebrate with a reward. Whether the process of attaining the final goal takes weeks or months or even the entire year doesn’t matter. What’s important is that you’re taking the time to weave a new habit into your daily life.


  All of which brings us to the flip side of progress, which is the inevitable slips and stalls that happen along the way. Chances are, you’ll fall off the resolution wagon at some point; it’s important to understand that you haven’t failed. If it’s a small blip, forgive yourself and return to your regular routine. If you’ve taken a sustained break and lost ground, forgive yourself and start from scratch.


  Rebooting the pursuit of a goal can be a challenge, which is why being part of a like-minded community is so helpful.


  Whether it's a friend or family member, a trainer at a gym, an employer's wellness program or a local running club, having someone to share the journey with can make a big difference. If a running club sounds good to you, the Road Runners Club of America keeps an extensive list at their website, rrca.org.

If a fake rape victim is admitted to the UK at the drop of a hat, one would think, hope, a convicted rapist would be kicked out. Not so. Somali national Abdalla Hemed turned up in Scotland as a refugee. That was in 2002. In July 2004, he raped a woman in his apartment. He was arrested for that rape, and on August 1, 2006, he was granted bail. The following day he raped another woman at knifepoint. In December 2006, he tried to rape another woman, again at knifepoint, and eight days later tried to rape yet another woman whom he had lured to his apartment.

I understand the argument made by Raphael regarding the removal of the game, it being that developers (or publishers) should control where their games exist. Other factors could also play a part in the adding or removal of a game from a streaming service like GeForce Now, such as potential contractual obligations with another service or even the simple requirement from developers that they want the game on the owners' hardware, for whatever reason.

The instigation of Draconian anti-illegal immigration measures does not mean we should not help these people, indeed we should, but there are positive ways to do it. One is by the development of open source technology including investment in solar energy. On a continent where the Sun never stops shining there should be a constant source of electricity. Another way is by cancelling much of Africa’s debt. As like the national debts of Western nations, much of this debt is created out of thin air, there is no reason it can’t be vanished into thin air, and if a few hedge funds have to take a haircut, tough.

La falta de eficacia, una muralla de nombre Jimmy Roca y las distracciones defensivas le pasaron una factura de alto costo a The Strongest que cayó ayer frente a Nacional Potosí (3-1) en el estadio Víctor Agustín Ugarte, por la jornada 10 del torneo Apertura.


  Era un partido para que el Tigre lo ganara tranquilamente, incluso por goleada, porque dominó y tuvo a Nacional acorralado cerca de su arco, pero no supo embocar.


  Nacional, en cambio, dio la lección de eficacia y aprovechó los defectos en la marca de la defensa atigrada para convertir los tantos y quedarse con las valiosas unidades.


  El panorama atigrado en el torneo ya es para preocuparse, porque no logra mantenerse en la senda de la victoria y ha bajado al penúltimo lugar de las posiciones con 9 puntos después de ocho partidos.


  La figura del golero Roca creció hasta convertirse en un gigante que le puso un candado seguro a su arco. Tuvo al menos ocho atajadas con voladas espectaculares para evitar que el Tigre convierta.


  Varias veces se repitió la imagen de los atigrados tomándose la cabeza incrédulos ante las respuestas del guardameta del potosino.


  Pero cuando parecía que el gol atigrado se caía de maduro fue Nacional el que se puso arriba en el marcador. En su segunda llegada convirtió mediante el Sub-20 Mario Barbery, quien se elevó sin ninguna oposición en el área pequeña para meter un cabezazo alto y escribir el 1-0.


  El guión del segundo tiempo no tuvo variantes, The Strongest manejó la pelota, presionó en busca de dar vuelta el marcador pero sin poder anotar por las seguras respuestas del cuidapalos.


  Una descoordinación en salida entre Veizaga, Valverde y Castillo fue bien aprovechada por Paolo Jiménez, quien quitó la pelota y encaró solo para definir ante la salida de Daniel Vaca, a los 13 minutos, con un remate cruzado (2-0).


  El partido se hizo más cuesta arriba para el paceño por la expulsión de Gabriel Valverde (23’), pero la propuesta del Tigre no se modificó, apeló a toda su artillería y trató de al menos empatar.


  Rudy Cardozo fue el único que pudo vencer la resistencia del guardameta Roca a los 38 minutos con un remate desde unos 35 metros.


  The Strongest se volcó con todo en busca de la igualdad, pero se expuso y cayó liquidado de contragolpe: Mancilla quedó bien perfilado entre dos zagueros, recibió la pelota desde unos 20 metros, entró al área y eludió al golero para el 3-1 final a los 49.

Intel Core i9-10900 ES 10 Core Comet Lake-S Desktop CPU Benchmarks Leak Out


  Intel's existing 9th Generation Core CPUs introduced 'KF' and 'F' suffix processors, and it seems as if these variations of CPUs will continue into the next generation. 'F' suffix CPUs indicate the lack of an integrated GPU, and by marketing chips in this manner, Intel may capitalize on chips that may have a defective integrated GPU, and in the case of Intel's ongoing CPU shortage, 'F' suffix CPUs aid Intel in staying up to par with demand. 'K' suffix SKUs indicate the chip has an unlocked multiplier, or, in other words, has had restrictions removed enabling the end-user to overclock their chip. 'KF' suffix CPUs are both unlocked and iGPU-disabled processors.

“I am humbled and honored to receive this award on behalf of our most loving and generous community. We will continue to defy hatred in all of its virulent forms. We will remain El Paso Strong. God Bless El Paso.”
 The entire audience rose to applaud.
 KVIA’s longtime news anchor Estela Casas, now executive director of the University Medical Center Foundation and Children’s Foundation, proceeded with the presentation of the El Pasoans of the Year award to the community of first responders.
 “We appreciate your courage and willingness to put your lives in harm’s way for us,” she said. “We want to commend you for your dedication to protect our community and to respond to situations and work through them and bear witness.
 “We are here to recognize excellence and to say thank you.”
 Those first responders include law enforcement officers, from police and sheriff’s deputies to customs and FBI officers, along with emergency services and medical professionals, from EMTs, doctors and nurses to hospitals’ top administrators.
 “We thank you and your colleagues for what you did on Aug. 3 and the days that followed,” she said.
 El Paso Fire Chief Mario D’Agostino was among those who spoke.
 “I want to remind everyone here today that the outstanding performance we saw from these teams, our teams, was a testament to the performance they provide on a daily basis. They did an amazing job, and I could not be prouder of them.
 The shooting may have been six months ago, but it is still impacting the lives of survivors and others close to the events themselves, as well as the larger community.
 At the conclusion of Wednesday’s event, El Paso Inc. publisher Secret Wherrett announced the company’s $5,000 donation to the Borderland 100 Club, led by former police officer Amanda Walsmith.
 “The 100 Club is a national nonprofit built on a premise that if 100 people donate $100 to join the club, there would be $10,000 to help the family of a first responder who died in the line of duty,” Wherrett said.

LONDON -- The dollar retreated on Monday to one-month lows against a basket of currencies, weighed down by the prospect of a full-blown rate-cutting cycle to counter the economic damage inflicted by the coronavirus.


  Panic in global markets that saw world shares shed almost $6 trillion last week prompted U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to issue a statement late on Friday saying the central bank will "act as appropriate" to support the economy.


  Investors took his comments as a hint the Fed will deliver a cut when it meets from March 17-18, and as an encouragement to central banks around the world to follow suit. Futures now imply a 50 basis point cut at the March 18 meeting.


  "The Fed is among the G10 central banks with the highest interest rates so it has more room to cut rates, and that's making the dollar weaker. What's priced for the ECB is roughly 15 basis points by the end of 2020 while for the Fed it's 100 bps," said Ulrich Leuchtman, head of FX strategy at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.


  The dollar index slipped 0.2% while against the euro the greenback was down half a percent to touch a one-month low of $1.109.


  Markets are now expecting Australia to cut rates on Tuesday, and possibly Canada later in the week, while seeing a 50-50 chance of a European Central Bank move next week.


  Despite money market pricing, ECB policymakers remain reluctant to ease policy further from the current rate of minus 0.5% and the euro is benefiting from that as well as the lack of room for monetary stimulus.


  Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also issued a statement to say it would take necessary steps to stabilize financial markets. The yen rose nonetheless and was up 0.3% to 107.82 per dollar.


  The Australian dollar rose 0.4% to $0.6531 and the pound also rose 0.4% to $1.2850. The offshore-traded Chinese yuan rose 0.2%, having earlier touched a one-month high at 6.95.


  Analysts said that the scale of the virus' spread meant markets would stay on edge, however, keeping a lid on moves. Officials in Washington state confirmed the second U.S. death from the virus, while New York has confirmed its first positive case.


  Chinese PMI surveys underscored the risk to world growth, showing factories were dealt a devastating blow in February as the outbreak triggered the sharpest contraction in activity on record.


  While German PMIs appeared to show the downturn was easing, IHS Markit, the compiler of the data, said it could be a "false dawn" which didn't fully incorporate the effects of the virus.


  "It's a bit of a dilemma today between celebrating Fed cut prematurely and really selling off risk," said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.


  "What's most important, to quote (movie) Jerry Maguire, is 'show me the money'. It's not so much about the interest rate - a 25 basis point interest rate cut is not going to make a business that cannot find cashflow feel better," he said.


  Speculation has also risen of a coordinated move by global central banks but there was no official comment on this. (Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo and Tom Westbrook in Sydney; Editing by Catherine Evans)

  If they do, adidas' payment will drop from £75m to £52.5m - a £22.5m loss. More than half the fee United paid for Bruno Fernandes in January.


  And, according to The Athletic , the reduction can be spread out over the remaining five years of the deal. That's £4.5million a year less.

That hilarious if not invincible defeatism is the heart of the matter. Black commentators when challenged in the public debate are finding it harder to defend their corner in a country which is probably one of the least racist, multicultural countries in the world which gives black people opportunities. Indeed, the commentators’ journalistic career before becoming Oped editor at the Independent in 2018 appears to be pretty unremarkable, to say the least and many might argue that positive discrimination has placed her in a top job there. Is it an insecurity pang from her then that to continue to carry off the work of a respected journalist that racism needs to be a subject which is dominated by such ‘marginalised’ people? And if so, then why not let the truly marginalised take it, rather than those who preach about poverty from ivory towers?

On the surface, this looks like a bid for unity. No more biannual bipolarity when it comes to our clocks. Heck, the House majority leader and House minority leader are both co-signers. That doesn’t happen too often.


  But trust me, this is just setting up a fight between the early birds and the night owls. I can see the feathers flying now: Pick standard time, and at sunrise the clock will be set an hour earlier than it otherwise would have been. Go the other way and we’d save that daylight until day’s end, from now on.


  Just think of some of the absurdities we could see.


  Say we were to adopt standard time permanently. Come March each year, when the rest of the Eastern time zone sprung forward, we’d stay put. That would set up the surreal prospect of sunrise being earlier, according to the clock, in Atlanta than in New York City or Boston, which are several hundred miles further east.


  Mind. Blown.


  Of course, there could be a great opportunity here. If Georgia were to switch to daylight saving time full-time, we would be an hour ahead of everyone else on the East Coast during the winter. Bada bing, bada boom — we could be the first state to strike midnight on New Year’s Eve! Maybe the TV networks would broadcast the Peach Drop instead of setting up shop at Times Square. (Have you heard we have a tax credit for that sort of thing?)


  Before we call Ryan Seacrest home, though, there are a few things you should know. First, several other states are wise to this trend. Florida and Tennessee have already passed bills to stay on daylight saving time year- round, which sets up the strange possibility that Georgians could go to a different time zone not only by driving west, but also north or south.

 "Alan has been instrumental in the club’s success over the past four years, leading us up two leagues and arguably being responsible for captaining us to a level that at his time in his career has been challenging,” he said.
 “Huge respect has to go to him for his contribution on and off the pitch.
 "We have all enjoyed watching that wonderful left foot deliver pinpoint passes, crosses and some quite brilliant goals, and as he progresses with his coaching qualifications, this agreement allows him to look to the future.
 “Personally, I have always had an excellent relationship with Sheez. He’s a great lad who has been a leader for us on and off the pitch during some memorable times, and he leaves with an open door to come back as our guest at any time.
 “On behalf of the board, the club and I’m sure the supporters, we wish him and his family the very best for the future.”

 Critics say Pius XII, sometimes labelled "Hitler's Pope", knew Nazi Germany was murdering Jews but failed to act. He reigned from 1939 to 1958.
 But the Vatican says Pius XII worked behind the scenes to save Jews.

North America is expected to be followed by Asia-Pacific in terms of consumption on the back of expanding potassium sulphate requirements in food and agrochemical industries. Europe is expected to drive demand and positively impact potassium sulphate market growth over the forecast period owing to increasing potassium sulphate application for crop fertilization as these fertilizers cause very low burning of crop roots.

Three early voting polling places for the presidential preference primaries will be open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Mondays and from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. the rest of the week. All three polling places will also be open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, March 14.


  Early voting polls can be found at the Glynn County Board of Elections’ office at 1815 Gloucester St., Brunswick; at Ballard Complex community building at 325 Old Jesup Road, Brunswick; and Glynn County Fire Station No. 2 at 1929 Demere Road, St. Simons Island.


  Most candidates can turn in their qualification packets from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., said Glynn County Elections and Registration Supervisor Chris Channell. Republican candidates must qualify in the first-floor conference room of the Glynn County Courthouse, 701 G St. in Brunswick, while Democrats must go to the board of election’s office at 1815 Gloucester St.


  Deadline for qualifying is noon Friday.


  Candidates should check with the board of elections about qualifying times and locations.


  Qualifying for non-partisan offices will also be held in the board’s office.


  Independent candidates do not have a primary and qualify via nominating petition to be submitted by July 14.


  Some have already announced for various posts up for election this year.


  The chairwoman of Glynn County Democrats, Julie Jordan, announced she will challenge Don Hogan, R-St. Simons Island, in his reelection bid for state House seat 179.


  No Republicans have announced opposition to Hogan.


  State Rep. Jeff Jones, R-St. Simons Island, plans to run for reelection to the House District 167 seat. The only challenger to publicly announce a campaign is fellow Republican Buddy DeLoach.


  In the state Senate District 3 race, Republicans Cody Smith and Sheila McNeill have announced they will seek the seat being vacated by the incumbent, Sen. William Ligon, R-White Oak. Cedric King, a Democrat, has announced his candidacy for the seat too.


  U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter. R-1, will face fellow Republican Daniel Merritt in the primary. Lisa Ring, a Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Carter in 2018, will run again this year. This time, she will face Barbara Seidman in the Democratic primary.


  Glynn County Commission seats currently held by Allen Booker, Mike Browning, Peter Murphy and Bob Coleman — District 5, District 1, District 2 and At-large Post 2, respectively — will be on the ballot.


  Coleman and Murphy have announced they will not run for reelection.
