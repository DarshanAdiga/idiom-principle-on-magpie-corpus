More than any election in living memory, this one is not so much a choice between opposed policies as a totalising and bitter fight to the death between two mutually exclusive visions of what America is meant to be. In the way of such battles of beliefs (more akin to a war of religion), each side is convinced that the victory of the other spells the end of the republic, so the contest turns into a competition of terminal nightmares.

A moment of truth is at hand. Or perhaps a trial of strength, not just between two mutually and grievously hostile political tribes, but of the fortitude of American democracy itself and, above all, its presumption of a peaceful transfer of power from the defeated to the victorious candidate. In an unprecedented and shocking departure from normal practice, Donald Trump has given notice that his acceptance of the election result could be conditional on the decision going his way. Should that not happen (and at the time of writing it seems that it won’t), the cry of “rigged” will go forth from @realDonaldTrump.

A runoff would usually favor the GOP with the reduced turnout and Georgia's strong Republican presence in the statehouse. But if control of the Senate is on the line, all bets are off and both races are likely to be barnburners.

NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said 68 polling places are without power. The presidential election, along with many state and local elections are scheduled for Tuesday.He said his office is working with Entergy and other utilities to restore power, but polling places without power will operate using generators on election day.New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell voiced frustration about the issue. As many as 11 polling sites may be without power by Tuesday and the “Louisiana Secretary of State’s office has refused to take responsibility for supplying needed generator power.”She complained that the city will have to pay for the transport, installation and maintenance of the generators.FULL ELECTION COVERAGE HERE“We continue to confront every crisis 2020 has thrown our way, from the global pandemic to a relentless hurricane season, and to absorb the tremendous financial costs that have come with them. But for the Louisiana Secretary of State to add to that burden now, and to threaten the votes of our people at such a critical time, is absolutely unacceptable,” Cantrell said.Ardoin expects the majority of polling locations to remain the same, except in two parishes. In Lafourche parish, two precincts have changed. Precincts 10-7 and 10-9 have been moved to precinct 10-8 at Golden Meadow Middle School on Bayou Dr. In Plaquemines Parish, Ardoin said it is possible one polling location may be moved.He did not identify the precinct.In New Orleans, beginning at 9 a.m. Sunday, the Board of Election Supervisors will be meeting at the Voting Machine Warehouse in the east to test every machine to ensure they are in working condition.The machines will then be loaded with the supplies needed for Election Day and locked.“Make no mistake, we will make all efforts to ensure all can vote,” New Orleans City Council Vice President Helena Moreno said.However, Ardoin said Cantrell and Moreno were trying to “score cheap political points instead of being part of any solution.”He said his office has been working around the clock to restore infrastructure to pull off this election. They have been working with leaders on the state and local levels, as well as private sectors.“As I said yesterday in an update to the public, all polling locations without power restoration will receive generators to operate Election Day equipment. Mayor Cantrell and Councilwoman Moreno are either tragically misinformed or maliciously attempting a Putinesque spread of misinformation,” he countered.Copyright 2020 WVUE.

Drop boxes are just one example. As states grapple with the pandemic and look for new accommodations to ensure safe voting and representative counts, court rulings are following thick and fast. A supreme court decision last week ruled against extending Wisconsin’s deadline for counting mailed ballots up to six days after the election, despite fears that the pandemic could delay postal delivery and ballot processing. But in an all-important swing state that’s been ravaged by Covid-19, voters are also showing up in record numbers to vote early in person.

Against this tournament of nightmares, one struggles to remember times when a bitterly polarised America was able somehow to overcome these endgames of mutual political annihilation. Believe it or not, there have been such moments and one of them came to mind during the last election debate, when Trump yet again insisted that no president since Abraham Lincoln had done as much for African-Americans as himself. At which point, I yelled three letters at the television: L, B and J, as in Lyndon Baines Johnson.

Still, though, a win by a measly six points would do the trick, so Joe asked his panel if it could be done. But to be honest, the more pressing question he should have put to them was: how can Rob Kearney have a tan like that one day short of November when he hasn’t even moved to Perth yet? And seeing as Rob was on the panel, the mystery could have been solved.
