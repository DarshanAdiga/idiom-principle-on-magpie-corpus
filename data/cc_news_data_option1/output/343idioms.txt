Bailey said the team is currently holding tryouts. He said about 65 students expressed interest in the team and close to 80 are in the club altogether. Not every video game the team plays is recognized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference, so members who play those games might be relegated to the club instead of the team.
 "The club is also for those who might not be able to dedicate their time to an athletic team," Bailey said. "It still gives them the opportunity to play the games they enjoy."
 Sophomore Daniel Klein said he joined the team because he like playing video games with other people instead of alone. The lab allows his team to compete on a higher level, he said.

PAUL SMITHS — Game on.
 The Paul Smith's College e-sports lab is now a reality. It's fully stacked with 15 gaming PCs, four 32-inch TVs, multiple Nintendo Switch consoles and high-end gaming chairs designed after NASCAR driver seats.
 E-sports Coach Matt Bailey said the lab is a huge step up from the team's former practice area.
 "With our previous place, we did have to haul equipment back forth, which did become a little bit tedious," he said. "Now we have an official area that's just dedicated to the e-sports team."
 He said the old equipment the team played on was a little too slow for their competitions.

So what could this all mean? Well, we have a few ideas. Clearly, this new incarnation is supposed to be located somewhere around the time of Hartnell’s incarnation. The temptation would be to assume that she comes before him, but the series has suggested Hartnell’s version is the one that originally stole the TARDIS (as seen in 2013’s The Name of the Doctor) and got it stuck in the police box shape, which slightly throws a spanner in the works. How did Martin get a police box TARDIS if she came before An Unearthly Child?
