Even though we've done things to see how it is a way of deflecting insecurity, there's still aspects where you go, "Okay, but it's a little tough to excuse someone who looks like this, who has so much going for him, that you're just going to dismiss something that somebody says." And that's what he does [with Kate]. Yet what we're setting up, and it will be realized -- in fact, the next episode that I'm directing, which is the eighth episode -- when Kevin comes around to something, the better angels definitely speak to him. It takes him longer than it should, but they do. What we'll find out is he takes this journey. He begins to take more responsibility for the things that mean the most to him. And even though his initial reaction is to dismiss things -- to be cavalier or make light of them, or just be defensive -- what she says to him in that scene not only in terms of the way just simply he begins to work harder as an actor, it also affects him in terms of really what he wants from his relationship with Randall and his responsibilities in terms of his brother… You'll see from this episode through the eighth episode and further on, this is somebody that's really going to grow in a very beautiful way.

Tegucigalpa, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 18th Nov, 2020 ) :Storm Iota has killed at least nine people as it smashed homes, uprooted trees and swamped roads during its destructive advance across Central America, authorities said Tuesday, just two weeks after Hurricane Eta devastated parts of the region.
 Iota, which made landfall in Nicaragua as a "catastrophic" Category 5 hurricane Monday, left six dead in Nicaragua, two of them children who were trying to cross a river in the southern part of the country.
 Another two people died in the Colombian Caribbean archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina, as well as one woman in the indigenous community of Ngabe Bugle in Panama, where 2,005 people remained in shelters even as rains began to ease there.
 By late Tuesday Iota had weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, according to Francisco Argenal, the head of meteorology for the Honduran civil protection service (Copeco).
 Argenal told AFP that Iota crossed into Honduras over the eastern department of El Paraiso and passed 35 miles south of the capital Tegucigalpa.
 He predicted the storm would reach El Salvador by early Wednesday morning.
 The Honduran government ordered the country's main roads closed until Wednesday due to the risk of overflowing rivers.

Lakeview went on an 11-match win streak and another run of 10 in a row. Every member of the group improved, and in many cases, dramatically.
 Lilly Rowe, Katee Korte and Josie Bentz each had at least 100 more kills than the year before, Bentz and Rowe had an attack percentage 100 points higher, Reese Janssen had more than 150 assists ahead of last year and total team kills, attack percentage, aces, blocks, digs ... you get the picture.
 While the roster lacked the sort of powerhouse hitter other programs had on the court, Lakeview's success wasn't built on a superstar. It was built on multiplicity and a setter that understood all her options.
 For example, the Lady Vikes don't have a Mya Larson like Wahoo, but they had more total kills on the year and a larger share of the team's percentage spread out among the rest of the roster. Of the teams in the final top 10 that provide stats to MaxPreps.com, Lakeview had more total kills than all but one.

Bunker: Aiken County turns in 'good performance' financially in fiscal year 2019-2020
 “We have been averaging about seven stations open for the last several weeks,” Bunker said. “But there are a lot of additional personnel coming on board and if we have some people who are on medical leave come back, we should be able to get up to eight or nine stations (being open) on a regular basis.”
 The county also has tried harder to get additional assistance from private ambulance services to help fill the gaps. One of them, Gold Cross EMS, which is based in Georgia, brought a third ambulance into service in Aiken County on Nov. 2.
 So far during November, Killian said, there haven’t been any status zero situations in the county.
 Status zero means there are no ambulances available to take a call.
 Bunker described Killian’s progress report as “excellent.”

 They unanimously approved the third and final reading of an ordinance that changes how the county deals deals with animal control issues.

So at the end of September, just to be crystal clear, we have 304 plasma programs. We have – and that included 14 new pharma – plasma programs in the quarter. We had 11 pharma, we had 7 others, up from 4, and that 7 was 4 new corporate incentive programs, less than one program that ended. So we have a total at the end of September of 324 programs. But as Mark mentioned to you, Plasma should end the year with 339, and after the end of September, we signed those three additional programs we just referenced in pharma. So that gets us to 14. And we also have a pretty active pipeline on other new programs, two of which were actually signed in the fourth quarter bringing other to nine from seven. So essentially based on what we know right now without securing any new business in the pipeline, and again, under the assumption that the things that Mark indicated on the plasma side, take us to 339 and we get those executed in the fourth quarter will be – will increase from 324 programs in September to 365 programs in December.

Why this particular memory? "In this world, we're all digging wells. In our lives, we're digging wells. We're digging wells in relationships, where we put all this time and effort and energy and sometimes it doesn't give us what we need. We put all out time and effort and energy in dreams and business and it doesn't give us what we were after, but if you just keep digging—my God, if you could just hear me now—keep digging. You may be four inches away from every gift and blessing you ever wanted in your life."

THE NEST   Written and directed by Sean Durkin   With Jude Law, Carrie Coon, Oona Roche, Charlie Shotwell   Rated R      The setting is a ranch house on a nice spread of land in woodsy, suburban New York. The time is ... well, we don't know the exact year, but President Reagan is talking on the radio. Mom and dad and their two kids appear to be happy together. Allison (Carrie Coon) has some rental properties and gives horse riding lessons. Daughter Samantha (Oona Roche) - from Allison's first marriage - is a budding gymnast. Son Ben (Charlie Shotwell) is happy to play soccer out back with dad. Dad is Rory (Jude Law), who drives the kids to school each day, then gets lost in thought about how well he was doing in London - before they relocated to the States - and how his career (he's some sort of entrepreneur) is now floundering.      It's in that ranch house that Rory makes a secret phone call, to his old boss in London, and when all is said and done, announces to Allison that they're moving to London because "I have an opportunity there, and I'm running out of options here."      He goes on to tell her the first of many lies about the details of that opportunity, but it's soon clear that lying is part of what he does. Rory knows his way around his business, and he's a great talker and charmer, but his life and career are all about putting up a good front, convincing people that he's more ... better ... richer than he really is.      Despite opposition from Allison and the kids, the family changes settings, and is soon living in a huge manse out in the English countryside (Rory brags to Ben that Led Zeppelin once recorded an album there; is it another lie?). He's back in an office, working as a commodities broker for his old boss Arthur (Michael Culkin, whose IMDB bio mentions that he's "unmarried and lives in London and Norfolk with several dogs and a llama"), and has plans to move up the ladder within the firm.      But Rory keeps getting in his own way. He wants to show off Allison at a big party. She's not comfortable with that. He tells everyone he meets that he sends his kids to expensive schools. No one cares. He explains to Allison that Arthur approached him about the job, but she finds out that's not at all the way it happened.      The film is both a study of an ambitious man who's out of control, and of a family that's coming apart because of him. Mom and dad and the two kids are definitely not happy together. He isn't up to the task at work, she's forced to take on a menial job, Ben is bullied at school, Samantha is becoming surly. They're being stretched to their limits, and we worry about all four of them.      Writer-director Sean Durkin, whose only previous feature was the intense and unsettling "Martha Marcy May Marlene," has sharpened his skills here, both in his script's words and the way he has his actors deliver them. Most noteworthy are the two-hander scenes between Law and Coon, and the ones with Law and Culkin. There's also a great, forlorn soliloquy from Law in the back seat of a cab about once being rich.      One of the most impressive feats that Durkin pulls off is keeping the film on an even keel, making it appear that nothing much is happening, though all the while hints are being dropped as to where everything is heading.      Personal funds dwindle, confrontations about it occur, more lies are told, tensions rise, deals fall apart, desperation sets in. Things turn verbally and emotionally angry. The story has an uncertain ending, but Durkin doesn't leave viewers in a despondent mood. He manages to blend in the tiniest glimmer of hope that things just might work out.      "The Nest" is now available on all cable and digital VOD platforms.   Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

Hennessey said the proposal is still in its early stages.
 “It’s not something people need to be alarmed about now,” he said.
 A public-private partnership board created in 2012 approved the proposal that would allow the Department of Transportation to lease the bridges to private operators who would then collect tolls and use the revenue to pay for repairs and maintenance.
 James Sikorski, Pennsylvania advocate for the National Motorists Association, said tolls can have a variety of negative side effects.
 “Tolling is basically another tax. This may lead to people trying to find alternative routes to avoid the toll road. Drivers are less likely to spend money on other things if they have to come up with money for tolls,” Sikorski said. “There would be much more road funding available, too, if the gas tax revenue was not being diverted to mass transit and the state police.”
 The Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association also has balked at the plan, saying the industry has already taken a beating from the state’s 2013 gas tax increase, and that unlike fuel costs, tolls are difficult to pass along to customers.
 Joe Butzer, interim president of the motor truck association, said the industry had been “blind-sided” by the announcement that tolls could be coming down the road.
 Alexis Campbell, a PennDOT spokeswoman, said the department has made it clear that it would be seeking “alternative funding options for quite some time,” and Transportation secretary Yassmin Gramian talked about it during budget hearings earlier this year.

Borough secretary Alex Ashcom said he's heard several people are interested in the property.
 "I've heard everything from art studios to event space," he said. "But I'm not sure yet."
 Ashcom is applying for a $30,000 State Farm grant to cover the cost of demolishing the property as well as transforming it into green space.
 He said contractors so far have quoted him a price of $12,000 for demolition, which would leave a majority of the grant for green space and also a pickleball court and renovated tennis and basketball courts across the street at The Mound park.
 "Everybody in the city uses The Mound," Ashcom said. "It's a great place to hang out, and we need to put some more money into it."
 If the borough does not obtain the State Farm grant, Ashcom said there are other funding streams to explore.
 "We have to deal with this house for the residents," he said. "It would be nice to get this grant, but if not, there are other things in the works without using borough funds to pay for it."

Outdoor dining, elective surgeries, and salon and spa services that allow for a mask to be worn all will be allowed to continue.
 The measures stop short of a full-blown return to a stay-at-home order like the one Pritzker issued in March, something he suggested in recent days could be in the offing.
 This latest round of mitigations aims to limit gatherings and encourages residents to stay home as much as possible and follow proper safety measures when out in public.
 While this latest round of mitigations does not include a stay-at-home order, if the mitigations are not adhered to and cases continue to rise in the weeks ahead, another order may be required.
 The mitigations carefully balance the paramount goal of saving lives while preserving the option for in-person learning for children and protecting as much of the economy as possible
 from the continued impacts of the virus.
 "To stop this spread and preserve some semblance of the holidays, all of us need to do more than just wear our masks now — though masks are mandatory throughout the state,” the governor said.
 “The simple fact is that COVID-19 is spreading so quickly and so widely, and our hospitals are beginning to experience real strain and at the current infection rate they will be overwhelmed. So whenever possible, we need you to stay home.
 "I'm hopeful that by limiting our in-person interactions, we will succeed at avoiding a stay at home order like what we had in the spring — when the choice between saving lives and saving livelihoods was even more stark. Tier 3 may allow us to do both. Like in other states like Michigan and California and Washington, it's our best effort to avoid a stay-at-home order and save lives."

Meghan Markle desperate to earn lots of money and Netflix offered them something, says royal expert
 Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are at a crossroads over their life-changing deal with Netflix deal, that they have been moved to give up.
 This is because the streaming giant has come under fire for its grotesque and cruel depiction of the senior royals in season four of _The Crown._  
 Angered royal experts have warned Harry and Meghan against proceeding with their production deal with Netflix.
 Royal biographer Angela Levin has warned that Netflix will want a "pint of blood" from the royal couple.
 "I think Harry made a terrible error. I think the way that he has left the royal family, the way he did it, and he’s changed," she said on Good Morning Britain.
 "He’s almost unrecognisable from Prince Harry I spent a lot of time with. But I think, you know, Meghan is desperate to earn lots of money and Netflix offered them something," Angela added.
 "I think they’re being naive as they have been about lots of things in that they don’t realise that a big company like Netflix is going to want its pint of blood.
 "They’re going to delve in and get a lot of information that will absolutely decry the royal family. I think the royal family does a lot of for us. Of course they’ve got a lot of faults, haven’t we all.
 Slamming _The Crown,_ Angela said, "I think the programme stinks actually. It’s spiteful, it just goes for people’s negative points rather than their positive ones. It is unbalanced.
 "It’s like a golden apple that inside is rotten. It is very, very unfair to the royal family," she added.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission said in October it had found evidence of failure adequately to train people investigating alleged anti-Semitism, political interference in the processing of complaints, and harassment of individuals.
 Corbyn, 71, reacted to the report by saying the scale of Labour's anti- Semitism problem had been overstated by the media and his political opponents, and that his attempts to deal with the issue had been blocked by "obstructive party bureaucracy".
 Current leader Keir Starmer has been trying to make a clean break from the hard-left Corbyn era as he seeks to turn around Labour's fortunes after four successive general election defeats since 2010.
 "I know that this has been another painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle antisemitism," Starmer wrote on Twitter.
 "I am absolutely resolute in my determination to make the Labour Party a safe place for Jewish people."
 Corbyn welcomed the decision by Labour's National Executive Committee to reinstate him after three weeks and said the focus should now be on challenging Prime Minister Boris Johnson's administration.
 "Our movement must now come together to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government," he said.
 But the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Jewish Leadership Council and Community Security Trust were critical of Corbyn's readmission in a joint statement.
 "Labour’s mountain to climb to win back the trust of our community just got higher," they said.

President-elect Joe Biden won Michigan by more than 148,000 votes, a win made possible by a strong showing in Wayne County. If those votes weren't eventually certified, it could have jeopardized Biden's claim to Michigan's electoral votes. President Donald Trump has mounted a longshot attempt to overturn the election results through lawsuits and with the Electoral College, though GOP lawmakers in Michigan have said they'll respect the statewide popular vote.
 Biden won 587,074 votes in Wayne County, compared to Trump's 264,149.
 During the meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, Vice Chair Jonathan Kinloch called the earlier deadlock "reckless and irresponsible." Kinloch is one of the two Democrats on the panel.
 "This board, over the years, has taken pride in not allowing politics to show itself in the actions of what we do," Kinloch said. "There is no reason under the sun for us to not certify this election. I believe politics made its presence here today, and I think forever that this board will have to live with the fact that we have allowed external, non-relevant issues to impact this decision today, hoping to change and bring about an outcome that will not happen."
 The Republican chair of the board, Monica Palmer, explained why she had earlier voted against certification.

The plan will accelerate troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan in Trump's final days in office, despite arguments from senior military officials in favor of a slower, more methodical pullout to preserve hard-fought gains. Trump has refused to concede his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, just five days after the troop withdrawals are to finish.
 Miller, who refused to take questions from reporters after reading a prepared statement before TV cameras at the Pentagon, said the U.S. will reduce troop levels in Afghanistan from more than 4,500 to 2,500, and in Iraq from about 3,000 to 2,500.
 Speaking a week after taking over for former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was fired by Trump, Miller notably did not say that the drawdown plan had been recommended or endorsed by Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or by other senior military officers. He said only that military commanders had agreed to execute it.
 Miller said the U.S. remains ready to respond if conditions in Afghanistan or Iraq deteriorate.
 “If the forces of terror, instability, division and hate begin a deliberate campaign to disrupt our efforts, we stand ready to apply the capabilities required to thwart them,” he said in a roughly eight-minute statement — his first extended public remarks since taking office.
 The withdrawal plan falls short of Trump’s oft-repeated vow to end America’s long wars. It also runs counter to his guidance that troop withdrawals be based on the conditions on the ground, not a date on the calendar.
 In Afghanistan, in particular, military and defense leaders have consistently said the Taliban has not yet met requirements to reduce violent attacks against Afghan government forces. Some have worried that too-fast troop reductions would strengthen the negotiating hand of the Taliban and weaken the position of an already-weak Afghan government.
 The decision has already received a cool reception from some Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, and a somewhat uncharacteristically blunt critique from NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
 “I believe these additional reductions of American troops from terrorist areas are a mistake,” said Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, who is the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. He said the Taliban, whose hold on power in Kabul was destroyed when U.S. troops invaded the country in October 2001, have “done nothing — met no condition — that would justify this cut.”
 Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, endorsed the Trump decision.

New York, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 18th Nov, 2020 ) :European and US stock markets were mixed Tuesday as a rally based on reinvigorated hopes for a coronavirus vaccine ran its course.
 Equities on both sides of the Atlantic surged higher on Monday following news from American biotech group Moderna that its vaccine candidate was 94.5 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 -- the second positive vaccine news in a week.
 On Wall Street, the Dow and S&P; 500 hit new record highs Monday, with the Dow coming within 40 points of 30,000.
 But the rally petered out on Tuesday, with the Dow closing 0.6 percent lower and the Nasdaq and S&P; 500 also ending in the red.
 Analysts believe the setback is temporary considering that New York stocks were due for a pause after significant increases this month.
 "It doesn't seem that the market is really in any danger of giving back any serious gain," Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital told AFP.

Russlands Präsident Wladimir Putin dürfte entzückt sein, wenn sein Amtskollege Donald Trump den Rückzug der amerikanischen Truppen aus Afghanistan und Irak gegen den Willen seiner Militärs tatsächlich beschleunigt. Und der saudische Kronprinz Mohammed bin-Salman könnte sich kein schöneres Abschiedsgeschenk wünschen, als einen Militärschlag auf die iranischen Atomanlagen. Aber im nationalen Sicherheitsinteresse der USA liegt es nicht, wenn der scheidende Präsident die Wunschliste seiner weltweiten Despoten-Freunde abarbeitet. Im Gegenteil, es macht ihn auf seine letzten Tage im Weißen Haus brandgefährlich.
 Trump mag für viele schon eine „Lame Duck“ sein, zu Deutsch: eine lahme Ente, also handlungsunfähig, aber er kann immer noch wie ein angeschossener Löwe agieren. Aus dieser Sicht betrachtet, macht Trumps Rausschmiss seines Verteidigungsministers Mark Esper und der drei Abteilungsleiter im Pentagon Sinn.

“I think it started in the offseason,” Fell said. “He started to exhort himself during workouts. He was always the first to finish in sprints and the first one to take reps. Guys just kind of followed him.
 “When your best player is leading like that, everybody falls in line.”
 Ta’ase’s leadership shined throughout the summer when Mountain View and other programs were attempting to conduct workouts during Arizona’s first major surge of coronavirus cases. The outbreak eventually led to several programs, including Mountain View, taking a few weeks off while cases plateaued.
 Ta’ase continued to work during the team’s down time. He kept referring to his sophomore season as a motivational factor. In 2019-20, he thought of himself as just an above-average player after recording eight total sacks in 12 games.
 To him, that wasn’t good enough. He wanted to take the next step to become elite.
 “I worked with my dad on my technique, footwork, basically anything I could do to improve my game,” Ta’ase said. “I didn’t want to have another season of one sack games. I aimed to have these breakout games where I get three or four sacks every time.”
 Ta’ase was well on his way to averaging that mark every game before running into a couple of tough matchups. He wasn’t able to record any sacks against a tough Red Mountain front in the third week of the season. But he made up for it a week later with a four-sack game against Desert Vista.
 While he aims to out-perform himself on a weekly basis, he remains content with the overall outcome of the games. Now in Week 8 and preparing to face Corona del Sol, Mountain View is 6-1, its best start in years. The Toros are well on their way to clinching a spot in either the 6A Conference playoffs or perhaps a spot in the Open Divison.
 By nature, Ta’ase aims to have the opportunity to prove himself in the Open Division against the state’s top teams. Whether or not he and Mountain View are able to do that remains to be seen.
 But one thing is certain, with the help of a Ta’ase-led defense, Mountain View is quickly putting itself back on the map.
 “We hear some people saying, ‘oh, maybe Mountain View is back,’” Ta’ase said. “All I have to say to that is yes, it is. We all have one goal and that’s to win a championship.”

That's it, IMPACT Wrestling and The Rascalz have parted ways. The trio hung their jackets up on the ropes and bid farewell, giving fans one last Rascalz Goodbye.
 When they went to the back with Rich, they were blindsided by Ken Shamrock and Sami Callihan. The Draw exclaimed that he didn't care about The Rascalz leaving, as they were no longer part of the equation.
 After taking them out with a trash can, Callihan and Shamrock focused on Swann, who will be putting his IMPACT Wrestling World Championship on the line against The World's Most Dangerous Man next week.
 It's rumored that The Rascalz will be heading to WWE soon. No matter where they go, it's clear that their futures are bright. However, should they ever want to go back, it's obvious that IMPACT Wrestling would welcome them back with open arms.
 Throughout the match, the commentary team spoke incredibly highly of all three men, and were so proud of how much they have grown as competitors in the past three years.
 Fans feel the same way. Watching these three explode onto IMPACT Wrestling and steal the show week in and week out is just one of the many reasons why the promotion has become one of the best on the planet.

Nearly a year after the oil and gas business provided a record $3.1 billion in revenue to New Mexico’s coffers, the coronavirus pandemic has claimed that industry as one of its victims, an expert on the issue told members of a key legislative committee.
 “The pandemic has had so much impact because so much of it [revenue] is transportation-driven,” Bernadette Johnson of Enverus Market Intelligence, an energy industry data and software company, told the Legislative Finance Committee on Tuesday.
 “We’re not seeing international travel nearly like we were, not seeing domestic travel like we were; we’re not even seeing people drive around in vehicles,” she said.
 Nevertheless, Johnson said oil prices have risen from under $20 per barrel earlier this year to about $40 per barrel. It’s a hopeful sign, though long- term recovery of the industry will remain “an uphill battle.”
 The drop in revenue will have a significant impact on states relying oil and gas revenue to fund public schools, road upkeep and other components of state budgets, she added.
 Sen. John Arthur Smith, D-Deming, the outgoing chairman of the committee, said the reliance on oil and gas revenue is all the more apparent when $3 billion out of New Mexico’s $7 billion annual budget comes from that single source.
 “Hope springs eternal that someday we’ll have a more reliable revenue stream,” Smith said. “The [oil and gas] industry has given us an extremely reliable permanent stream” that has flowed into the state’s permanent funds, which help finance public schools and other entities in New Mexico.
 A Legislative Finance Committee handout from the presentation said the state’s oil crash began in March, when the pandemic reached New Mexico and led Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to declare a state of emergency.
 Another factor in the bust was a collapse in price stabilization agreements among OPEC nations and Russia.
 The state’s oil drilling rig count declined from a peak of 117 in March to between 40 and 50 rigs through the first week of November, according to an analysis. Johnson saidNew Mexico had 54 rigs working as of Monday.
 Decreased demand and lower gas prices — a benefit for consumers — have led many oil and gas operators to shutter wells, which could be expensive to reopen as lower production levels or inactivity continues, she said.
 Painting a more optimistic long-term view, she said the “better news” is that by this time next year the state should be on a price recovery trajectory that will “increase significantly and quickly into 2022-2023.”
 Worldwide, a number of factors will remain in play in terms of how quickly and well the industry will recover, Johnson told the committee.
 Global oil producers agreed to a historic production cut in the spring, leading to a drop in production of some 2 million barrels of oil for the time being. She said negotiations about whether that drop will be maintained are expected soon, and the outcome could add uncertainty to the equation.
 Legislators from both political parties asked Johnson what impact the upcoming transition from President Donald Trump to President-elect Joe Biden will mean for the business. A recent _Forbes_ opinion piece that looked at years of oil production rates during both Republican and Democratic presidencies concluded a president has little impact on the industry’s productivity.
 Johnson, vice president of strategic analytics of Enverus Market Intelligence, said as much in her presentation, adding state policies and guidelines — more than federal regulations — play a role in the industry’s success.
 “Today the higher risk is probably not from the federal level,” she said. “The bigger impact is at the state level on infrastructure, renewable [energy], legislation around flaring, all of that is more impactful than what we see at the federal level.”
 Sen. George Muñoz, D-Gallup, asked Johnson how the industry will fare if the COVID-19 crisis continues through 2021. She replied a recovery will be delayed as long as the virus continues to plague the country.
 “Volatility is going to continue to happen no matter what happens” regarding COVID-19, she said.
 In the interim, prices at the gas pump likely will hit an average of somewhere around the $3.50-per-gallon range sometime in 2021, she said.
 Right now, those prices are hovering slightly above the $2 mark.

CLINTON -- Friday was a day Clinton senior Brayden Randolph won't soon forget.
   
 The running back/linebacker ran for 113 yards and knocked down a Blissfield lateral to secure the 16-13 win for the Division 6 district championship.
   
 But prior to the game, Randolph signed his National Letter of Intent to wrestle at Lake Erie College, an NCAA Division II program located in Painesville, Ohio.
   
 "It fells great," Randolph said. "Especially to do that and then come out (to Blissfield) and get a great team win. It was a great feeling and a great day."
   
 Randolph is all about team and family and those were the deciding factors for the three-time Division 4 all-state honoree.
   
 Randolph, who is 80-13 during his high school career with two runner-up finishes, one third place finish and a team state title to go with a team runner-up title, was sold by the family atmosphere around head coach Jeff Breese's program.
   
 "It was that family aspect," Randolph said. "I'm big into family and that's what we have on this football and in our wrestling team here at Clinton. That Lake Erie team, I knew right from the start that's where I wanted to be."
   
 Randolph's team-first mindset is exactly what Breese is looking to bring into his program that hasn't been ranked in the top-30 since 2017 or have been to the national duals since 2016.
   
 The Storm have won the Great Midwest Athletic Conference duals championships in 2019 and have sent at least one wrestler to nationals each year since 2012, but Breese was looking for wrestlers to buy into the team.
   
 "We were looking for Rainmakers and OKGs in the 2021 class," Breese said in a press release. "Rainmakers are people whose influence can initiate progress or ensure success. OKGs are our kinda guys and our kinda guys believe in the potential that exists at Lake Erie College to chase down huge wrestling success while being one of the best teams in the country academically.
   
 "This is an elite group of young men that combined with our existing roster has the potential to make history for our program."
   
 Along with Randolph, Lake Erie is welcoming in Austin Fietz and Tyler Swiderski of Dundee who have helped Dundee win three-straight Division 3 state titles.
   
 "A lot of those other recruits I know pretty closely," Randolph said. "Fietz and Swiderski, I hang out with them and go duck hunting with them. I train with some of the other guys, Connor Liber (Sylvania Northview) I trained with him at some camps. It's a great group of guys and we all have the same goals and mindset and that's to come out on top."
   
 While Randolph is gaining a family in Painesville, Ohio, it's not too far (192 miles) from Clinton High School.
   
 Randolph is the oldest of four and he's looking forward to see his two younger brothers follow his footsteps in Clinton athletics.
   
 "I want to come back and watch my brothers grow up and go through this program," Randolph said. "I want to be able to watch that, so that was really important for me."

It's cliche to say that I couldn't put it down, but, really, I couldn't put it down. It was a page-turner.”
 Kelley added, “When we set about adapting it, the biggest challenge for me was to be able to deliver what the book did, and that is the tension, the thrill, the drama, the relational equations of the characters, which were rich and profound at times, and then the sense of escapism. It was a great ride, a great journey. And I'm hoping the audience and, particularly, given the times when they throw on the television at the end of the day, we will be able to deliver that sense of fun, drama and escapism to them.”

It's always tough for a solo artist to go up against a trio, but Ben Allen's going to try his hardest. Blake tells Usher that these two acts are his "classic country singers" and he thinks it's best to keep it to one moving forward. Ben's voice is a big, deep, radio-ready country voice and Blake applauds him for using the Knockouts to show he can do contemporary country. He warns him about too many "country dips" on notes and Usher instructs him to "pull back a little" and remember to tell the story of the song. These notes help Ben give what John Legend calls another "consistently good" performance. He's consistent! Reliable! Kelly tells him that "no one's worried about [him] faltering." It's not exactly the most exciting or passionate critique an artist can get, but Gwen does tell Ben that this was her favorite performance of his. She's a fan -- that's not nothing! Meanwhile, mother-daughter trio Worth the Wait steps on stage and gives what John says is "easily [their] best performance." In rehearsals, Blake told them that they really needed to tighten up their harmonies -- that's their advantage in this competition and they need to use it to the fullest extent. The note must hit home because their harmonies have never sounded better.

WARREN COUNTY, Ohio (FOX19) - Mason City Schools Superintendent Jonathan Cooper says the district is seeing a concerning increase in the number of students hospitalized for having suicidal thoughts.Over the past three weeks, Cooper puts the count at 15 students, including some learning remotely and others learning in person.Northern Kentucky psychologist Dr. Ed Connor says the trend is driven by the pandemic, and it isn’t just happening in Mason.“Social isolation reinforces depression and anxiety,” he told FOX19 NOW Tuesday. “So it’s nothing new per se, but with the pandemic we’re seeing a lot more children staying at home, and they’re online a lot more than what they previously were because of what they have to do.”Connor explains some children overreact when they get frustrated, bored, depressed or anxious.“Some children lose their appetite,” he said. "Sleep disruption is fairly common.'Outside those symptoms, Connor says some will isolate themselves in their rooms because they’re “sulking.” He also says the key to heading off suicidal thoughts in children is communication.“As a parent, you have to persist and you have to stay with it and try to get them to open up,” he said.And when you do get them to open up, Connor says you should start the conversation with leading questions.“'Tell me what’s going on,'" he offered, “and being curious. Eventually a lot of children will start to talk and open up, but if you start to lecture about, ‘You shouldn’t be on that phone so much,' or, ‘Don’t pay attention to what they’re saying,’ that goes in one ear and out the other.”Connor says parent should immediately seek help from a mental health professional if their children start making statements about wanting to die or hurt themselves.See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

Though, we are focusing on making garments for new- born babies. The proceeds will be used to further train women from rural areas in Goa and provide them employment in my workshop, handmaking milk cotton for producing garments on a larger scale.

"Based on what I saw and went through in poll books in this canvas, I believe that we do not have complete and accurate information in those poll books," Palmer said.
 In Benson's statement, she said it was "common" for some precincts to have minor discrepancies with their poll books. But she also said, "Importantly, this is not an indication that any votes were improperly cast or counted."
 Election experts and Michigan insiders reacted with shock to the original vote.
 "The people have spoken: Joe Biden won Michigan by more than 140,000 votes," Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a statement. "Today's action is a blatant attempt to undermine the will of the voters. The process, however, will move forward. Under Michigan law, the Board of State of Canvassers will now finish the job and I have every expectation they will certify the results when the job is done."
 Nancy Kaffer, a columnist at the Detroit Free Press, tweeted, "This is unprecedented in my 20 years covering government here." Amy Walter of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report tweeted, "There has been zero evidence of fraud here or elsewhere" and said Republican efforts to block certification "does real and lasting damage to our institutions."
 "It's so politically transparent that I doubt it will hold up in the long run," Ben Ginsberg, one of the most prominent Republican election lawyers in the country, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Tuesday night.

Di Stefano, nell’intervista ad “Agenzia Nova”, affronta poi il tema della Libia. A suo modo di vedere, il Foro di dialogo politico libico concluso ieri a Tunisi senza accordo sul nuovo governo “non è un rallentamento politico”, ma anzi un’accelerazione se si considera la situazione in Libia “soltanto due mesi fa”. “Io non vedo nessun rallentamento politico. Se guardiamo soltanto a due mesi fa qualunque passaggio che si sta facendo è un’accelerazione”, ha detto Di Stefano. “Io credo che oggi la Libia, con tutti gli scongiuri del caso, non tornerà al caos di qualche mese fa. Dobbiamo soltanto tutti lavorare affinché lo sviluppo politico sia sempre un crescendo e nel frattempo lo sviluppo economico diventi un fattore stabilizzante fondamentale”, ha aggiunto Di Stefano. Il Forum del dialogo politico libico organizzato a Tunisi dalla Missione di supporto Onu in Libia (Unsmil) si è concluso senza alcun accordo sul meccanismo per l’elezione del nuovo governo, ma con una data sulle elezioni: il 24 dicembre 2021, il giorno del 70esimo anniversario dell’indipendenza. L'inviata dell'Onu Stephanie Williams ha annunciato il proseguimento delle consultazioni politiche tra le parti libiche tra una settimana, via Internet, precisando che il dialogo continuerà perché è "l'unica soluzione alla crisi".

Paris, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 18th Nov, 2020 ) :Olivier Giroud continued his remarkable scoring record for France with a brace as the World Cup holders came from behind to beat Sweden 4-2 in the UEFA Nations League on Tuesday.
 Viktor Claesson's deflected early strike gave the away side the lead behind closed doors at the Stade de France, but Giroud soon equalised and Benjamin Pavard put France ahead before half-time.
 Giroud then headed in a Kylian Mbappe cross to make it 3-1 before the hour mark, taking him to 44 goals in 105 appearances for his country. Kingsley Coman scored France's final goal after Robin Quaison netted Sweden's second of the night.
 Having recently overtaken Michel Platini's tally of 41 goals for Les Bleus, Giroud is now closing in on Thierry Henry's overall record mark of 51.
 The 34-year-old has not always been a popular member of the France side but remains a key player for coach Didier Deschamps despite being on the periphery with his club Chelsea, for whom he has started just one game this season, in the League Cup.
 "I am used to being heckled and jeered. That has just been part of my experience, of my career, but it only makes me stronger," Giroud told television station M6.
 France had already secured top spot in League A, Group 3 ahead of holders Portugal, thereby qualifying for the Nations League finals in October next year.
 Sweden, meanwhile, finish bottom of the group behind Croatia and will be relegated to the second-tier League B for the next edition.

 # Eastham officials rethink plans for harbormaster building
 By Denise Coffey
 Cape Cod Times
 EASTHAM — It’s back to the drawing board for the architects tasked with the design of the new harbormaster building at Rock Harbor.
 The Capital Projects Committee on Monday decided to send Kuth Ranieri Architects a list of requirements for a building to be located north of the current harbormaster building.
 The modern, wedge-shaped design of the building, along with its height and scope, drew angry comments from residents at a public meeting in September. The building's estimated cost was $1,192,832.
 The committee is now considering a site north of the parking lot. The site could trigger some environmental permitting and a review under the Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program, according to Shana Brogan, the town’s project and procurement director.
 Because the building would sit farther back from the harbor, it’s elevation would only be 5 feet above ground level. That’s 4 feet less than what was initially proposed with the wedge-shaped structure. Fencing, shrubs and grasses could be used to disguise the pilings.
 The committee's requirements include a building no less than 600 square feet in size, a deck for use by the harbormaster, parking, and a walkway connecting the harbormaster building with the docks and ramp.
 Town Administrator Jacqueline Beebe suggested the committee consider a building similar to the harbormaster building in Provincetown, with its bank of windows, functional cupola and distinctive Cape Cod style.
 Harbormaster Scott Richards suggested that a covered gazebo or similar structure be built near the docks and ramp where an auxiliary building now stands.
 An earlier design called for a V-shaped building that would have sat close to the water and docks. A roof extended out over a V-shaped deck with public access to ramps, platforms and walkways.
 Critics of the plan objected to the building’s height and its modern design. There were objections to a bulky roof extension over a 1,200-square-foot deck that would cut into property owners' sight lines.
 An extensive walkway with built-in platforms was aimed at drawing in the public for outdoor events. The committee also considered placing educational kiosks on the property. But residents on Dyer Prince Road, which leads to Rock Harbor, didn’t like the idea of increased traffic on the road, and some thought the scope of the project was far greater than necessary.
 The committee considered using an historic Cape from 60 Dyer Prince Road as the harbormaster building. The two-story, half-size Cape would have been professionally moved to the Rock Harbor site. However, the town’s building commissioner, Justin Post, cautioned against it.
 The building was infested with wood-eating insects that made their way to the second floor, along with other animals, and Beebe said it would have required a lot of money to renovate for any purpose.
 “We’d have to replace every stick in the building,” she said. “We’d end up with a replica of the building and rebuilding wasn’t the point.”
 The committee also turned down the suggestion of using a modular building on a seasonal basis. Beebe said a seasonal-only building was never part of a harbormaster building plan. Such a plan would require a modular building to sit up on stilts or a platform because of sea level rise, as well as two professional moves annually.
 “The town voted to put a building there and we’re going to put a building there,” Beebe said.
 The committee also dismissed the idea of a floating harbormaster building. Floating buildings have been used in locations where there is no upland available for building.
 Such a design would involve extensive engineering. The electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and the design of a septic system would make it an expensive proposition, Brogan said.
 The floating building would also be exposed to wind and ice.
 It’s expected that Kuth Ranieri Architects will present its ideas at the next Capital Projects Committee meeting.

Johannesburg, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 18th Nov, 2020 ) :Mali and Tunisia qualified for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations finals on Tuesday to follow in the footsteps of title holders Algeria, Senegal and hosts Cameroon.
 Another 19 places will be up for grabs during the final two matchdays between March 22 and 30 with record seven-time champions Egypt among those close to securing places.
 Sekou Koita and Moussa Doumbia scored in Mali's 2-1 win over Namibia in Windhoek which clinched an eighth consecutive appearance at the African football showcase.
 Tunisia will be going to the finals for a record-extending 15th consecutive time after drawing 1-1 with Tanzania in Dar es Salaam, where Saifeddine Khaoui gave them an early lead.
 Neither Group A frontrunners Mali nor Group J pacesetters Tunisia are assured of winning their four-nation groups, but both are certain of top-two finishes and qualification.
 Senegal clinched a place Sunday, Algeria did likewise Monday and Cameroon fill the place automatically reserved for the host nation.

"But when we set forth with ABC, they were really frisky to break their own mold," he said. "And to present storytelling to the audience that would be more in line with cable or streaming. I think this show lends itself to be a great binging show. It would work very well on streaming. But at the end of the day, ABC came to us, declared their passion for telling the story the way we wanted to tell it, and here we are.”
 For Kelley, the commercial breaks were his biggest challenge in this format.
 Because this is not on a streaming service where viewers can watch several episodes at once, Kelley explained that at the end of each episode of “Big Sky” there will be something that has the viewers eager for the next week’s show.
 “The structure of this show is we will do four- or five-episode arcs,” he said. "So, the first season, for example, is 10 episodes. That will probably be two five-episode arcs. They bleed into each other and overlap, but they're primarily two different arcs.”
 That way, if someone only watches the first half of the season, they will get a full story. The fact that this show is airing on broadcast and not streaming was brought up several times during the press conference. Yes, there is a big difference in how a show is written depending on where it is aired, and getting back to the broadcast formula was a challenge for Kelley. But he hopes it will satisfy viewers and they will embrace the series.
 “Big Sky” stars Ryan Phillippe, Kathery Winnick and Kylie Bunbury. It premieres Tuesday on ABC.
