EREVAN — The capital of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan was shelled on Thursday, Armenian separatists in the province said, ending a lull in bombardments brought on by a ceasefire.
 Emergency services in Karabakh wrote on Facebook that Azerbaijani forces struck "civilian targets" in Stepanakert, in what is the first confirmed strike on the city since Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed a truce in Moscow last Saturday.
 An AFP journalist in Stepanakert reported hearing nine loud explosions and said smoke could be seen rising near residential buildings on the outskirts of the city.
 Stepanakert has been shelled on and off since fighting between Armenian separatists and Azerbaijan's forces erupted late last month in clashes that have claimed hundreds of lives, including civilians.


 But the situation in the city had been calm since the longstanding ex-Soviet rivals agreed to halt fighting last week to exchange prisoners and bodies of people killed in the fighting.
 Armenia and Azerbaijan's foreign ministers agreed a humanitarian ceasefire, but both sides accused the other of violating the agreement within hours after it was supposed to take effect.
 Azerbaijani forces have advanced along the north and south of the frontline, taking positions in Karabakh and in two districts of Azerbaijan that have been under Armenian control since 1994.

The second set, however, was all Bearcats as they dominated their way to a 25-8 win led by the stellar play of Payton Shreve who was all over the court for the hosts.


  The match closed out with a much more competitive third set as the Knights jumped out to a good start by taking an 8-4 lead to quickly match their second-set point total. They would eventually increase their advantage to 12-7 and seemed to have the momentum.


  That all changed when Grafton limited its errors and stormed out to a 12-1 run to lead 19-13 before eventually ending the match with a 25-14 stamp. In total, the Bearcats closed out the match on an impressive 18-2 run.


  “We stopped playing in the second set,” commented Lewis. “We were much better at the start of the third set, but then we just got sloppy all over the place. When you play a good team like Grafton, they’ll punish you when you make mistakes.”


  Grafton’s junior varsity squad avenged its earlier loss to Preston with a 2-0 sweep by scores of 25-12 and 25-21. The JV Bearcats had overcome a 14-7 deficit in the second set.


  “Our JV beat them when they came to our place, but we just came out really flat tonight,” said Lewis.


  Preston is scheduled to host Philip Barbour at 6 p.m. on Monday if Barbour County is able to jump back up to at least the “Yellow” metric in this coming Saturday’s COVID-19 case map. If that match doesn’t happen, the Knights will return to action at home on Tuesday against Lewis County.

Earlier this year, Square Enix announced that Kingdom Hearts would be back in an all-new rhythm-based game with original story content. The Melody of Memory evokes a bit of the Final Fantasy franchise's Theatrythm that was a hit on the 3DS - but with more variety in gameplay styles. Today, a demo came out to give fans their first playable taste of the full game on the Nintendo eShop, PSN, and Xbox. The demo features four solo music stages and two co-op stages - offering up a nice bite-sized chunk of the full game. It's perfect for anyone who was just curious to see how the game would turn out and should easily sell folks on the game if they were on the fence. The full game will be released on November 13 - amid a crowded next-generation launch across two console platforms for $59.99.

Certainly, with Brock Lesnar, Ronda Rousey and now Roman Reigns…On a specific basis, what I’m most proud of after the fact is that even after my run concluded, the chairman of the board, Vince McMahon, was asked on a quarterly earnings call about Paul Heyman no longer being the executive director on Monday Night Raw. His answer was how happy he was with the creativity I'd brought to the role. Any time someone is replaced in that level of corporate positioning, you will always hear, “We appreciate what he brought to the table, but it was time to do something else. He was great at what he did, but this other move is even better.” Vince offered nothing but how happy he was with my creativity.

Watch Sinkfield and Gardner, and track their performances. How does each offense do with them on the field? Can they continue to produce at the same level as their backfield mates? Does the offense look any different when they are on the field? Think of each as not a sub, but as option 1B to their counterparts’ 1A.


  It’s a story that plays out at practically every school in the country. A ballyhooed freshman signs with a program, and is accorded star status by many before he has ever run one rep on the practice field. Or, a new player makes an appearance in an early season game (as often as not a blowout of an inferior foe) and puts up some good numbers. That is also met with high praise, and often outsized expectations.


  Then, over the next couple of weeks, the player drops from view, leading to all sorts of speculation, some reasoned, and much of a more ridiculous nature.


  For West Virginia, one of the players this year that fits into that category is freshman wide receiver Sam Brown. After a debut against Eastern Kentucky in which he caught four passes for 43 yards, some were ready to anoint him as the king of the wide receiving corps. When he didn’t play in WVU’s next two games, many of the same people reversed their assessments.


  “With any young player that has a chance to show great promise, if you are not careful, those guys playing in game one puts the thought in many people’s heads – media, parents, family, the player – that it’s easy. I don’t think that’s fair,” offensive coordinator Gerad Parker said. “Sam Brown is going to be a great player. But he has some habits we have discussed that he needs to continue to grow upon. He has to be accountable and know what it means to be a great player all the time and not just on game day. He’s growing like every freshman has to. He’s learning how to practice the right way. He’s learning how to be at lifts at 6:00 a.m. on time, and embracing what it means to be a college football player.”


  Parker’s comments could apply to any number of players — indeed, he mentioned that this sort of growing process extended back through the start of his coaching career. Without question he was taking this chance to send another message to Brown, but it’s also an instructive point for fans and observers. One great game doesn’t mean a player has arrived, and a couple of “Did Not Play — Coach’s Decision” notations don’t mean he’s a bust.

GRAFTON — The Grafton Bearcats enjoyed a 3-0 sweep (25-23, 25-8, 25-14) over the visiting Preston Knights in Tuesday night’s high school volleyball contest.


  It was a match that was similar to the teams’ prior meeting back in early September where the first and third sets were more competitive while the second set was heavily one-sided (25-17, 25-6, 25-17 in that match).


  “We’re getting to the point where we have a few servers who can string stuff together, but we’re still not consistent,” said Preston coach Zebulon Lewis. “We don’t really have anybody who I can say ‘that person will be solid every time they’re on the court.’”

The city of Delray Beach has a new resolution that is changing the way it does business, and they are encouraging local shops to follow suit.As restaurant manager Maurice Roisman walked through El Camino restaurant in Delray Beach, he said one thing is for sure.The restaurant is ahead of the curve when it comes to the use of recyclable products."We've already been using, as long as I've been here, a cardboard container for all of our hot to- go items, even to the point for little things like our straws. We use a biodegradable straw from agave," he said.Earlier this month, the city of Delray Beach passed a resolution encouraging businesses to limit their polystyrene use.Maurice Roisman, restaurant manager at El Camino in Delray Beach, says they are at the forefront of using recyclable items.Commissioner Juli Casale said to think of foam cups, plates and takeout containers for this new resolution."The EPA has stated it can have serious impacts on human health, wildlife, and the aquatic environment. So, it seems like a great place to start," she said.Kent Edwards is the sustainability officer for the city. He said polystyrene products can last hundreds of years in a landfill. He is encouraging more businesses to get on board. Edwards said there are more alternatives to turn to."Avocado seeds can be used in materials. You have birch as a tree, bamboo, even locally sourced sugar cane," he said.Delray Beach Commissioner Juli Casale says the new resolution is a step to help protect the environment and reduce non-biodegradable items.Roisman said using recyclable products at El Camino is the right thing to do."We want to be right for the community. We want to be a good place to hang out, but also be responsible business people at the same time," Roisman said.Casale said another important component to the resolution is the city will begin negotiating a no polystyrene use into their contracts with city vendors.Scripps Only Content 2020

_Oliver Darcy writes:_ "A good barometer for judging a Trump interview is whether the anchor asks the president the questions and follow ups on the minds of voters sitting at home and watching. This sounds simple, but often fails to happen in interviews with Trump, as he does his best to roll over the person asking him questions. Guthrie, however, excelled and did not let Trump off the hook. When Trump, for instance, declined to take responsibility for promoting a deranged Bin Laden conspiracy theory by arguing that he only retweeted 'an opinion of someone,' Guthrie responded by channeling what most people watching were probably thinking. 'You're the President!' she exclaimed. 'You're not someone's crazy uncle who can retweet whatever.' Those moments, which occurred over and over, made Guthrie's interview worth watching."

Differing opinions are both welcomed and accepted among members of the Black community and we do not encourage the censorship or silencing of any students on our campus. However, we want to bring attention to the impact of regurgitating such negative generalizations of the Black community.

Black students on Baylor's campus are working relentlessly to bring a voice to the experience of being Black in America. This should not be undermined by someone who does not resonate with nor acknowledge the challenges of facing bias and prejudice in this country.

South Burlington’s Mike Donoghue, who is first vice president of the New England First Amendment Coalition, recently helped train the Burlington City Council on the state’s Open Meeting Law, emphasizing the need for transparency within municipal government.
 NEFAC, in a news release/blog post, noted the Burlington City Council sought the 90-minute training session after admitting it violated Vermont’s Open Meeting Law by improperly going behind closed doors with three protesters to discuss police personnel. The training session was part of the council’s efforts to cure the meeting violation.
 Donoghue also serves as executive director of the Vermont Press Association, based at St. Michael’s College. He is a retired Staff Writer with the Burlington Free Press — current correspondent for The Other Paper — and has been called upon to offer testimony on improving state legislation, including laws on Open Meetings and Public Records.

The plans argue that ‘The FA lacks credibility and has proved to be largely ineffective as a governing body. It has not modernised and is not sufficiently independent.’
 It comes after Project Big Picture, the controversial Liverpool and Manchester United-backed plan that would increase funding of EFL clubs but also see the Premier League’s big six be given the power to make decisions in the top tier of English football, was shot down by clubs.
 This new manifesto calls on Parliament to introduce legislation to bring about radical reform to English football.
 The seven-point proposal calls on a new body to be created that:
   1. Is independent of the current structure of football.
   2. Decides on new ways to distribute funds to the wider game based on a funding formula.
   3. Sets up a comprehensive licencing system for professional football.
   4. Reviews causes of financial stress in the EFL, including parachute payments, solidarity payments, salary caps and mandatory relegation clauses in players’ contracts.
   5. Implements governance reforms at the FA, including a reform of the FA council.
   6. Liaises with supporters’ organisations to help progress issues that are of concern to fans.
   7. Studies lessons from abroad over supporter involvement in the running of clubs.

He clearly was trying to inject some humor into the proceeding, but the question was still highly inappropriate. Would a senator debating whether to declare war on Japan after Pearl Harbor have thought it appropriate to lighten the mood with an ethnic joke?


  There’s a time and a place for levity, but serious debates on the future of the country aren’t one of them.


  Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., was one of the few senators who rose to the moment. That’s not surprising, as the legislator has frequently decried the lack of seriousness that prevails in today’s Congress.


  His thoughtful line of questioning was geared toward establishing what Barrett’s jurisprudence meant and how it was crucial to the proper role of the judiciary in a democratic system of government.


  Anyone who listened to their exchange would have learned something about the nominee’s beliefs and her fitness to serve on the court. That’s exactly what these hearings were supposed to accomplish.


  The Senate likes to call itself “the world’s greatest deliberative body.” That honor was once deserved, as members from all backgrounds and political parties actively discussed issues seriously.


  Today’s senators, however, seem uninterested in doing that; instead, they use the body’s committee rooms or the Senate floor as a platform from which to read talking points prepared by their staff for regurgitation in friendly social media.


  That is the political equivalent of a sugar high, producing a short burst of recognition but damaging the institution’s ability to do what it is supposed to do: discuss and pass legislation that affects people’s lives.


  It’s no wonder that serious and ambitious women and men are increasingly attracted to the law or the bureaucracy, institutions where they can do actual work. The fact that such people wield their power behind closed doors and without public discussion or consent, though, simply shows how our democracy is slowly dying before our eyes.


  Cicero’s senators were unable to save their Republic. Monarchy, first from Julius Caesar and then from his adopted son, Augustus, became the only way to establish some form of stable government for Rome and its empire.


  The more America’s senators resemble ancient Rome’s in their obtuse preening, the more we risk drifting into an autocracy of our own.

The fallacy of "Black on Black crime" acts as a diversion to the Black Lives Matter movement; it is both misleading and fundamentally flawed. A single statistic cannot encompass the complete scope of police brutality in America, nor should ​disparities in homicide rates​ be reduced to such a racialized and inflammatory phrase. Moreover, crime is based on proximity, opportunity and socioeconomic factors. The crime done within the Black community is a reflection of years of systemic oppression and inequality that has diminished opportunity, resources and community vitality. ​Those​ are the most prevalent threats facing Black Americans today. Lack of access to proper healthcare, sustenance and education continue to plague Black communities, and these are the issues that the Black Lives Matter movement and its supporters address.

For his sixth solo exhibition at the gallery, Gedi Sibony has combined salvaged materials fashioned into objects, staged within and among the remnants of temporary walls from the previous exhibition, guiding visitors through a symbolic sequence distributed in broad blocks of space.


  Both the elaborately figurative ornamentation and the architecture of its galleries and passageways must be understood in light of their functional purpose: to provide a summarizing expression that unfolds itself into sensually tangible coherence. Encounters with discrete objects are integrated with the experience of moving through the gallery, from different viewpoints that cut across and through the layered objects and spaces. The entrance is made ceremonial and allows for visualizations and associations.


  The space is divided into three intersecting spheres. The central axis, broken into two progressively growing chambers, invokes the temporal aspect of reality. The forward trajectory and the holding of beliefs. As the middle space, it could be seen as a formulation of the corporeal essence as it seeks understanding, experiences death. In the outer terrace by the windows, a series of wooden desk-like sculptures repeat in a shifting serial format that reveals a strange compositional logic. The space furthest from the windows is dark and inaccessible, dramatizing the frontal aspect of the vignettes within.


  As a rough map, the guidelines presented here should be abandoned at the trail head, and only serve the purpose of overview and approach. It is the inner space of the advancing visitor that brings the mute structure to life.

McNemar and his line mates would also be inheriting the fiery brand of coaching employed by Trickett, a hallmark of his 50-plus years of teaching. It is a daily dose that McNemar has adjusted to and learned to appreciate.


  “It is never boring with Coach Trickett,” McNemar laughed. “It was an adjustment for some guys, but you can’t ignore what he has accomplished. He knows more football than any individual that I have ever met. You just have to accept two things; one, you are going to get yelled at…accept it. And two, if you listen to the man, he is going to make you a better player.”


  McNemar and the young offensive line gradually showed improvement during the year. The Pioneers materialized several impressive wins against some strong opponents; most notably were the victories over Fairmont, Notre Dame, and Frostburg. The victory at Notre Dame was when the Falcons were undefeated and ranked sixth in the nation.


  “When I first came here, McNemar was not a guy I saw as being as productive as he has become,” Trickett said. “What he has done is testament to what hard work and doing the right things can do.”


  Glenville’s offense performed when needed, and surprised many with some serviceable numbers; 120.1 yards per game on the ground, and 204.4 through the air.


  “There were definitely some ups and downs with it being such a young group, but we had some guys really come a long way during the season,” McNemar said.


  Kellar’s accomplished history of developing strong offensive play is well documented and McNemar cites the team’s success, and the offense’s productivity, to his head coach.


  “Coach Kellar has had a lot of success, and is really good at developing trust and developing good relationships within a team. I was able to play against two of his sons in high school,” McNemar noted. “His offensive schemes are pretty complex, but he finds a way to keep them simple.”


  While the team is now working toward a potentially shortened spring regular season, McNemar and his upper-class teammates have been working with a talented freshman class. Many of the strong newcomers are on the offensive line.


  “These freshmen can play,” McNemar said. “They are bigger and stronger than classes we have brought in in the past. Plus, they are a good bunch of guys that come to work every day.”


  While the future is looking bright for the Pioneer football program, the future is also looking bright for McNemar personally. With the NCAA granting a year of eligibility if a league chooses to play only 50% of their normal schedules as the MEC is planning for the spring, there is the opportunity for an additional year. It is a season that McNemar plans to utilize before moving on with the next phase of his life.


  McNemar’s career is a path filled with a great deal of promise. He entered GSC back in 2016 as an Exercise Science major. But after a year and a half at the institution, he changed to Natural Resource Management with a major in Land Surveying Technology.


  He has spent the last four summers working for Mike Ash with Mountain State Land Surveying in his native Lost Creek. He has also performed well academically, earning a spot on the MEC Academic Honor Roll. His plans are to stay close to his family and hometown.


  “I want to stay in the area,” McNemar said. “I plan to keep working for Mountain State and focus on getting my license. It is a good time to be involved with surveying, and I enjoy the work.”


  For Josh McNemar, the surveying tools will have to wait just a little longer…this spring, he will have one more trip to the football battlefield. One final season with his Pioneer teammates.

  Playing for Coach Tom Sears, he played power forward for the Hawk basketball team. In football, playing for Jett, McNemar was on a unit that produced a steady rise in the team’s success during his four years.


  After playing mostly on the JV unit as freshman, McNemar became a starter as a sophomore in the 2013 season. Starting mostly underclassmen, the young Hawks went 2-8. McNemar became a starter at tackle on both sides of the line, and would hold these starting spots for the remainder of his high school career. The following year produced a major improvement as the team went 6-4, finishing 17th and just missing the Class A playoff field.


  In 2015, McNemar played on what was one of the greatest teams in Hawk history as a senior. South Harrison produced a stellar 9-1 season, and gained home field advantage in the playoffs. They advanced to the second round, ending the year at 10-2.


  For his strong senior season, McNemar was First Team All-County, First Team All-LKC, and Second Team All-State. His great final season left an indelible impression on his head coach. Jett, who is now the head coach of the Sprint Football program at Alderson Broaddus, reflected on McNemar’s contributions.


  “In my 34 years of coaching at South Harrison, Josh McNemar is one of the absolute finest young men I ever coached,” Jett said. “He never said a word…just came out and did his job day after day, game after game. He was a three-year starter for us on both sides of the ball, and he was solid all the way…very dependable.”


  McNemar’s recruitment was narrowed to two local programs; Alderson Broaddus and Glenville State. AB assistant coach JJ Mayer (the current defensive backs coach at GSC) was recruiting him for the Battlers, while former Glenville defensive coordinator Blake Tasker was recruiting McNemar for the Pioneers. Ultimately, McNemar chose Glenville and head coach David Hutchison. At 6-foot-1 and 270 pounds, he was prepared to face the strong defensive linemen of the Mountain East Conference (MEC).


  McNemar redshirted the 2016 campaign, and worked himself into a starting role in 2017 for new head coach Eric Smith. He started nine of eleven games that season. Hamstring injuries hampered his 2018 season, and he was not 100% for most of the campaign, starting only two games.


  In the spring of 2019 a new head coach and a new staff came on board, and McNemar was one of only a handful of returning offensive linemen in the program. The new head coach was a fellow Harrison Countian; former GSC quarterback Mike Kellar, a Shinnston native.


  Kellar’s naming of Trickett as the Associate Head Coach/Run Game Coordinator was also pivotal for McNemar. The young man from Lost Creek would now be playing for a Hall of Fame offensive line coach — one who has produced 35 NFL players and two Division I National Championships.

He did call the three-strikes rule "wacko" at one point, even as he was helping to write the bill. Whatever his reservations about certain provisions, he ultimately voted for the legislation, which included the three-strikes rule and has come to be seen in the Black Lives Matter era as a heavy-handed and discriminatory tool of the justice system.

 Twitter locked the account of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday, after she cited a New York Post story about Hunter Biden that the platform is working desperately to ban after it was published earlier in the day.
 The New York Post published an exclusive story titled "Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian business to VP dad," reporting that "Hunter Biden introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company."

If this about Christmas expenses specifically, have a look at all the Christmas Club offerings from the supermarkets and The Warehouse. Countdown gives you a 5% bonus for funds deposited before 1 December. PaknSave and New World both rates equivalent to between 3.4 and 6.4 percent depending on when you deposit funds. The Warehouse is slightly different in that it gives you a 5% bonus of the goods you purchase, effectively giving you 5.26% extra funds.


   

  Downside is that these are only available from these stores only, however despite being kind of old hat, Christmas Clubs can be quite good value. Personally I would avoid Chrisco and Hampsta, though I haven't really looked into them. They have just never felt right to me with their advertising etc. Probably fine as long as you know what you are getting into.


   

  Edit: fixed percentages, PaknSave and New World min is 3.4%

Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Septet performed a new piece that Marsalis has recently composed called “Suite for Democracy.” The music was all inspired by contemporary issues — Black Lives Matter, COVID-19 and the political climate.
 “It was inspired by things that have happened during this time,” he said.
 For example, the first movement was “Be Present” which he introduced by saying it recognizes people who have been protesting and those who have worked during the quarantine. “People who have been forced to work even when they didn’t want to,” Marsalis said.
 The next movement was “Sloganize, Patronize, Realize, Revolutionize: Black Lives Matter.”
 He introduced the third piece by saying it is “about something funnier than anything I’m saying and that’s that our postmaster is making mailboxes bounce away, so this is called ‘Ballot Box Bounce.’”
 A movement called “Deeper than Dreams” is about the many people who have died whose loved ones have not been able to say goodbye, he said.
 A faint drizzle, lighter than eyelashes fluttering, fell during the performance. It was barely more than a mist that did nothing to dampen the audience or its enthusiasm, unlike Saturday when severe thunderstorms caused the cancellation of that evening’s show.
 This Saturday at 7 p.m., The Queen’s Cartoonists will perform the music of cartoons from Looney Tunes and Warner Brothers to the Simpsons. While six musicians perform the musical soundtracks, the cartoons will be projected on a screen behind them.
 Marsalis and The Queen’s Cartoonists are a first, and last for this year of performances sponsored the Shelburne Museum and the Flynn. The museum is closed for the season after this and the Flynn is not ready to resume live performances in the theater.
 MacQueen said the theater sponsored eight free outdoor performances at outdoor venues around Burlington during the summer.
 He doesn’t know and didn’t want to predict when the Flynn will be back up and running with performances there, although he did say he would love to see the Discover Jazz Festival in the theatre in June.
 “We won’t do it until it’s safe. We’re not interested in doing performances when it compromises people’s safety,” MacQueen said. “Just having the theater open would be a dream.”

BC news town hall with former vice president Joseph Biden just nineteen days until the election in this country of course voting already under way more than eighteen million Americans have voted. Tonight as you heard from the vice president there there was supposed to be a presidential debate president from pulled out of that debate when the commission wanted to virtual debated. After the Covert operative the White House Joseph Biden had agreed to do that instead been doing the town all here with the ABC and the president Italy moved this week agreeing to that. Town hall in another network sort of split screen in America tonight. We did hear the president. And the vice president depressed and several topics tonight the vice president in Philadelphia and now talking to those voters. Socially distanced in the audience Republicans Democrats and some. Undecideds they asked him about the pandemic whether he take a vaccine if ready before year's end he said yes if the scientists are behind it. He was asked if you would raise taxes on the wealthy and on corporate America even in a recoveries he said yes. There was a deeply personal exchange young voter asking Biden why young black Americans should go for him he made his case. He was asked about packing the Supreme Court and I want to bring in Mary Bruce. Who was outside the Constitution Center there in Philadelphia tonight because Mary you and I've been watching all week the confirmation hearing. But judge Amy coney Barrett president trumps pick to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Biden said tonight that it depends on how this is handled saying Americans are already voting. He was pressed on what that meant how this was handled he was pressed will he have a position on packing the court before Election Day. David Joseph Biden tonight notably went further on this issue than he has before he has been pressed on this repeatedly and while he still isn't giving a clear answer. On whether he would expand the court saying he's quote not a fan of court packing to nineteen notably didn't rule it out. Saying he will have a clear answer on this by Election Day after. The confirmation hearings for Amy Connie Barrett saying that Americans have and voters have a right to know with David of course voting is already well underway nineteen days ago nearly eighteen million Americans. Have cast their ballot so the question tonight is. What does Joseph Biden waiting for things. And merry stick with us on this he did say he got a position before Election Day and looking at live pictures right now. Interacting with the voters in that debate hall he was the one who first agreed to doing a town hall. After the debate was canceled this campaign. Certainly knows that they think these are good opportunities for the vice president to make his case by interacting with American voters. David here tonight we saw something that we really haven't seen very often in this campaign that has been up ended by the pandemic Joseph Biden. Having an opportunity to interact directly with voters answering their answering their questions about what matters. Most of them as they meet. This choice his campaign feels that he shines in these moments that he does best. When he is able to speak directly with voters I know that Joseph Biden misses having more of these opportunities. And I was struck tonight when you take a step back how much Joseph Biden tonight. Really talked about his plans there was a lot of deep diving that he was doing into his policy proposals going forward. This of the night largely about Joseph Biden and actually surprisingly not a lot about his opponent he didn't really speak that much about Donald Trump this is a night for him. Joseph Biden to connect with voters and talk about how heat. Would be changing their futures guess you rightly point out burial out more about policy and plans moving forward and we heard from but really either candidate in that first debate after the shouting match sort of erupted and really never ended as that debate played out in front of America as the vice president continues to talk with the voters there. A we also president trump in Florida tonight pressed in his own town hall on whether he was tested for Covert. But the day that first presidential debate is pressed a number of times on this if you took a test of the day that the baby says. I probably did it said he doesn't take a test every day. He was also asked if there was ever warn that this would be the greatest national security threat of this administration corona virus which has been reported that he was warning said he wasn't Warren. The petting zoo was a big threat. At the same time the presidents and I didn't want to panic this country have been Michael up there and say everyone's gonna die. Pressed on whether or not there's a middle ground whether or not he could have leveled with the American people he said no there's no middle ground. I want to bring in Rachel Scott she's live with us from Florida tonight where that town hall is playing out because as we're looking at pictures from Philadelphia we know the president tonight. Was pressed a net New York Times reporting on its taxes Rachel he was asked if he ever really did pay. Just 750. Dollars in federal income taxes he was also asked about the reported debt of about. 400 million asked who does he owe that money to. The David he was that he was asked whether or not he owes that money to foreign entities and he said quote not that I know what the president that downplayed. The amount of debt that he is in he obscenely said that it's just a tiny fraction of what he is worth. I'd even I was struck tonight about how much the president was on defense the president walked in tonight's into tonight's down hall. In that you know the behind double digits in the poll that time when he is under fire for its handling of the pandemic. And the president tonight spent much of his time on defense that any mishandling of not only the pandemic. Issues like health care as well as the economy what we did not hear a lot of tonight just nineteen days out from Election Day was the president talking about his rival Joseph Biden. And the president tonight was fourth. Southern front he questions about his how whether or not he tested negative up on that debate day is a lingering question one the president even said tonight that he. Could not even remember good adding them a call whether or not he was tested for run a virus on the day of the debate the president also tonight David downplaying. The corona virus insisting that we are rounding the corner. At a time when the CDC predicts that we may record 240000. That's just one week after Election Day David. Rachel Scott put us from Florida tonight and Rachel as she points out the president being asked was he tested on that debate night. In stark contrast to the image are seeing in Philadelphia right now former vice president Joseph Biden would his mask back on telling. A George just short time ago that he was tested again today daily testing now. Saying he would month of anyone in that room at risk and that he would. Followed the debate commission's rules but expect that everyone be tested before that final presidential debate still scheduled for next week I want to bring in our chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl. Watching this split screen in America as I mentioned John very different answers in both town halls are I'm curious John if you saw anything tonight. That really moves the needle in any significant way which Americans already voting. There are so few Americans that are undecided at this point David this is such a deeply divided country but watching. These two town off and I tried to watch them as you can imagine bolts at the same time. Quite quite big quite a task. And I what what you know this is such a strange campaign we have heard very little from either of these two men about what they would actually do over the next four years. And Biden has famously dobbs this question of expanding the Supreme Court and George really pushed him on this and we have what appears to be a commitment that after the Amy coney Barrett vote. He will tell the American people should voters have a right to know. Where he stands on expanding the court on the other side Donald Trump was asked a very simple question by a voter what is your plan to deal with health care and rising health care cost. And it was abundantly clear that he has absolutely no plan this is something he has had. Four years nearly four years in office. To come up way it's. He basically said that what he has done is he's done away with the individual mandate. With a obamacare and then talked a little bit more about how obamacare. Is is is not a good thing we need something better but absolutely nothing about what he would actually do want health care. And John as you've been reporting he's been saying for a very long time now have that plan in a couple weeks and aunt and still plan. Still a pleasure Jon Karl watching people debates we think you can tell you were watching you BC one in front of you. How well you were trying to watch the one on the other network at the same time we sure do appreciate that.

One year ago: President Donald Trump declared that the U.S. had no stake in defending Kurdish fighters in Syria who had died by the thousands as America's partners against Islamic State extremists; Trump's stance on the Kurds was condemned by Democrats and some Republicans who'd been staunch Trump supporters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats walked out of a meeting at the White House, with Pelosi accusing Trump of having a "meltdown"; Trump replied on Twitter that it was Pelosi who had a "total meltdown" and called her a "very sick person." Bargainers for General Motors and the United Auto Workers reached a tentative contract deal to end a monthlong strike that brought the company's U.S. factories to a standstill. (Workers voted to approve the contract the following week.) Former Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon agreed to a three-year deal to manage the Los Angeles Angels.

“What we always encourage — whether it’s a question under the Open Meeting Law or the Public Records Act — is in case of doubt, always err on the side of more openness, more accountability, more transparency,” Ernst told the council.
 “These two laws are absolutely critical to the functioning of our democracy,”
 The training session followed a complaint filed by Seven Days that councilors violated the law on Sept. 8.
