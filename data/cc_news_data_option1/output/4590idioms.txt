A Riot resolveu dizer adeus à Redução do Tempo de Recarga (RTR) na pré- temporada 2021 do _LoL_ e apresentar a Aceleração de Habilidade, nova versão do atributo.
 RTR é um atributo que reduz o tempo de recarga das habilidades do seu campeão, ou o tempo que a habilidade precisa para ser usada novamente depois de sua ativação. Isso é determinado por uma porcentagem e concedido por itens como Eco de Luden, bônus como o do monstro azul e runas como Transcendência.
 O limite da RTR é de 40% e só pode aumentar um pouco além disso, para 45%, com a runa Perspicácia Cósmica. Quanto mais RTR você tiver, mais valiosa ela é. Com 10% de RTR, você conjura suas habilidades 11% mais vezes; com 40% de RTR, já são 66% mais vezes.
 Aceleração de Habilidade é mais "flexível", segundo a Riot, e pode criar "escolhas de itemização mais claras" enquanto ainda permite que você use suas habilidades com mais frequência. Aceleração de Habilidade tem um "modelo de escalamento de poder linear para mais conjurações de habilidades". Dez de Aceleração de Habilidade equivalem a 10% mais conjurações, 20 de Aceleração de Habilidade equivalem a 20% mais conjurações e assim por diante. Isso faz com que cada ponto de Aceleração de Habilidade que você adquirir tenha o mesmo impacto, não um impacto exponencial.
 A RTR se acumulava exponencialmente, o que fazia dela tão forte que a Riot precisou criar o limite de 40% para não ficar tão poderosa. Com o novo modelo linear da Aceleração de Habilidade, no entanto, o jogo não precisa mais dessa restrição. Isso adiciona algumas opções de itemização que sacrificam outros tipos de poder para fortalecer as conjurações. Em outras palavras, a Aceleração de Habilidade é ilimitada.
 “Queremos que vocês possam alcançar a mesma frequência de conjuração de feitiços, mas o modo de conseguir isso será mais linear”, disse a Riot.

Earlier, Delhi got off to the worst possible start, losing Marcus Stoinis to the first ball of the match. A double strike from Trent Boult (3-30) had Delhi on the mat at 22/3. But skipper Shreyas Iyer (65 off 50) and Rishabh Pant (56 off 38) stitched together a 96-run third-wicket stand that pulled Delhi out of the woods and gave them a fighting total of 156/7. But the Mumbai batsmen were quick off the blocks, never allowing Delhi’s formidable attack to get their teeth in. And the final turned into a one-sided affair, shorn of excitement.

“We will have a president that wears a mask on a regular basis,” he said during a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “And I think that’s really important as an example for the country. And I think that it’s going to help in our fight against this virus.”


  Biden, after a meeting with his newly formed coronavirus advisory board on Monday, implored Americans to wear mask. The president-elect said that step could save tens of thousands of lives in coming months.


  President Donald Trump has downplayed the importance of masks in reducing the spread of the virus, even after he contracted COVID-19.


  Beshear said in the phone interview that he will encourage Biden to do “whatever is within his power to get each and every state to have a mask mandate.”


  “We are a state that shares borders with so many other states, some of which don’t have a mask mandate at all,” the governor said. “And the virus doesn’t care about state lines.”


  The governor said he has reached out but hasn’t had a chance yet to talk to Biden since his fellow Democrat claimed victory in the presidential election. The AP called the race for Biden on Saturday. Trump easily carried Kentucky, where Republicans dominated up and down the ballot.


  Beshear has highlighted his own brush with the coronavirus to stress the importance of wearing a mask to combat its spread. The governor said last month that he repeatedly tested negative for the virus after riding in a vehicle with a member of his security detail who later tested positive for COVID-19. Both of them were wearing masks at the time.


  Kentucky’s governor also said Monday that the president-elect can talk with compassion about “how hard this is to live through, how our lives have changed but the importance of doing the right thing — even when it’s hard — to protect your neighbor.”


  Beshear stressed that his team has worked well with Trump’s administration in battling the virus, and he credited the current administration for the pace of work on a vaccine.


  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Monday announced strong results from a vaccine trial and said it was on track to file an emergency use application with regulators later this month. Beshear said later Monday that it’s “too early to take that to the bank, but folks, if it holds, (it) is a game-changer and really good news.”


  While hailing Pfizer’s announcement, Beshear said at a news conference that the “reality of the moment” is the virus is spreading significantly in the Bluegrass State.


  Kentucky continued setting records with 1,745 COVID-19 cases reported Monday, the state’s highest daily number at the start of any week. The state also reported 11 more virus-related deaths Monday, raising the toll to at least 1,576.


  The statewide rate for positive tests was 7.49%, the highest since early May, he said, adding that infections are spreading so fast, contact tracers can’t keep up with the rising number of positive cases.


  Eighty of Kentucky’s 120 counties are reported to be in the red zone — the most serious category for COVID-19 incidence rates. People in those counties are asked to follow stricter recommended guidelines to contain the virus.


  Kentucky is coming off another weekly record number of virus cases and currently has its highest number of virus patients — 300 — in hospital intensive care units, the governor said. More than 1,100 virus patients are hospitalized in Kentucky.


  “We are in a significant surge,” Beshear said. “And if you’re not wearing a mask, we can’t stop the surge and you’re not protecting yourself.”


  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe symptoms and be fatal. The vast majority of people recover.

Skipper Shreyas Iyer (65 runs off 50 balls) led from the front to steer Delhi Capitals to a fighting total of 156/7 in 20 overs against the Mumbai Indians in the IPL 2020 final in Dubai tonight. That score had looked distant at 22/3 when Delhi were reeling after a twin-strike from Trent Boult. But Iyer and Rishabh Pant (56 off 38) stitched together a 96-run third-wicket stand that pulled Delhi out of the woods and put them in a position of strength.

Michelle Bachman rose to national prominence in 2012 when she ran an ineffective and bizarre campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination. Both she and her husband, Marcus Bachman, came under fire for operating a Christian counseling center that practices conversion therapy. Tthough Marcus Bachman holds a PhD., he is not a licensed clinical psychiatrist in the state of Minnesota. Michelle Bachman has previously attacked LGBTQ people on numerous occasions, labeling homosexuality a sexual dysfunction and equating queer people to pedophiles. Earlier this year, she also claimed “transgender black Marxists” were plotting to overthrow the US government.

In response to a commenter saying that she was unfollowing in light of the QAnon stories, Wang said, "GOOD I DONT SUPPORT PEDOPHILES." Accusing perceived enemies of pedophilia is part of what has made QAnon hard to stop. Even President Trump said in a town hall event in October that QAnon was simply "against pedophilia." In reality, though, human trafficking organizations and experts have repeatedly said that the movement has a dangerous misunderstanding of trafficking.


  QAnon's recent and rapid rise comes as the movement's incendiary theories have been linked to several violent crimes, including murders, as well as attempted kidnappings. The FBI warned last year that the movement could become a potential domestic terrorism threat. On Thursday, as Trump supporters protested Biden's projected win, two men believed to be QAnon supporters were arrested for driving an SUV full of ammunition to a Philadelphia ballot- counting center.


  Facebook, which owns Instagram, has made steps to curb the spread of the theory on their platforms, announcing a company-wide ban on the conspiracy theory and its rhetoric. But Wang's QAnon beliefs were mostly spread via stories, which automatically disappear after 24 hours, and went untouched by the platform. Insider has reached out to an Instagram representative for comment.

Bomgaars Supply, Inc., a farm and ranch retail chain based in Sioux City, Iowa, announced plans to open a location at the former Shopko building in Beatrice.


  Approximately 12-20 employees from the local area will work at the store, according to a press release. The store is currently scheduled to open for business in the spring of 2021.


  The 34,000 sq. ft. store is located at 123 N. 24th St. in Beatrice.


  Stan Meyer, who owns the building, said plans for Bomgaars to operate out of the building date back to around July when a grocery store failed to follow through on plans to use the building.


  “We think they’ll be great,” Meyer said. “They have a lot more clothing and some food items and a bigger garden section. It’ll be a little fill with Earl May leaving. It will be good and in this day and age there’s very few retailers looking at a city like Beatrice, or any city.”
