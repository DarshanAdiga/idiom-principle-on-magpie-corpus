"I’ve loved balloons all my life since I was a little kid. I would write notes to my parents in church asking for a helium tank this week and I would always get one," Cody Williams, Cody's Red Balloon owner said.


  But it's going to take more than just helium to lift our spirits.


  It also takes a desire to share a special message with our community.


  Whether it's light or darkness, this giant rainbow of hope shines for all to see.  

  Midlander Cody Williams wanted to be a part of something magical, sending a message of love and a time for West Texans to heal.


  "With everything we’re going through, it’s just mentally and physically ... so depressing and with what balloon artists do, we bring so much life to your event and I wanted to bring life to the community in some way and it also helps me deal with what’s going on with losing all these events and no work. It’s just hard to deal with and it’s a great coping thing for everybody," Cody said.


  But when it comes to how he put this display together, he said "That is a magical secret," Cody said.


  That magic, through a rainbow...a sign of peace.


  Something the world could use more of right now.


  He knew exactly which word to pick…heal… because he knows how much it hits home.


  "In Midland, we also have to heal not just from the virus, but from the oil situation as well. That’s another heartbreak for us too because everyone’s so dependent upon the economy here as to how you’re going to thrive in every industry," Cody said.


  But for the time being, when sadness rains down, Cody will keep turning to his balloons to do the uplifting.

An insider told The Sun: "With the show being so up in the air, they have been told to try and get negotiations up to the final stage and then it's a matter of waiting to see what happens."


  Strictly producers have been told that some potential contestants may be reluctant to sign up to the show yet as they may be required to look for better-paid, commercial projects to recoup money they are losing by being forced to stay at home due to the coronavirus outbreak.


  One celebrity who looks like a definite for Strictly 2020 is Jamie Laing, after the Made in Chelsea star was invited back by bosses following his injury last year, when he was replaced by eventual champion Kelvin.


  The show has already been rocked by two bits of bad news with the shock departures of professional dancers Kevin Clifton and AJ Pritchard.


  A number of BBC shows have been hit by coronavirus, with filming suspended on EastEnders, Casualty and Holby City and Little Mix's new talent show The Search postponed.

In a letter critical of Barcelona club officials, Lionel Messi said Monday he and his teammates are taking a 70% cut in salaries because of the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.


  Messi wrote in a social media post that the players will also make donations so other club employees are not affected by the upheaval.


  “A lot has been said about Barcelona’s first team and the players’ salaries during the country’s state of alarm,” Messi wrote in the letter. “Before anything, we would like to make it clear that we have always wanted to reduce our salaries as we perfectly understand that this is an exceptional situation and we ALWAYS were the first ones to help the club when it asked. Actually, we have done that on our own in moments when we felt it was necessary or important.


  “Therefore, it surprises us that within the club there were those who wanted to put us under scrutiny and tried to put us under pressure to do something that we always knew we would be doing.”

As Napa’s public school system works to overhaul its method of electing board members, it faces a problem unanticipated when the process began – collecting opinions and advice from a populace literally unable to weigh in face to face during the coronavirus epidemic.


  The Napa Valley Unified School District board confronted this difficulty Thursday night, during a meeting that included the second of four scheduled hearings on an area-based voting system in which board members will be chosen only by voters living in each trustee’s vicinity in Napa, American Canyon, Yountville and surrounding territories.


  With a statewide shelter-at-home order prohibiting public assemblies, trustees conducted their meeting as a videoconference from their homes instead of at NVUSD’s Napa headquarters. Although the Zoom conferencing software allowed residents to listen in and speak to the board for up to three minutes online – with Spanish and Tagalog translators standing by – school officials received only one public comment: from Scott Rafferty, the attorney whose petitions left both NVUSD and the city of Napa scrambling to retool their voting rules in time for the November election to avoid complaints of diluting minority influence.

The other glitch involves the game's latest vehicular addition, helicopters. Particularly useful in squad matches, these can transport a whole team across the map very fast (though they also make you an obvious target). Ordinarily, the maximum height you can reach is 280m, but if players on board repeatedly hit the pilot with a grappling gun, they'll slowly rise further and further into the air, far beyond the reach of others. This might not necessarily win you a Victory Royale (though it is possible if you hold out until the storm circle fully closes), but it will definitely confuse any players remaining in the game who are searching a tiny space for you.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — An arm of the federal government is temporarily waiving the need for some fishing vessels to carry at-sea monitors. At-sea monitors and fishery observers collect data on board fishing boats that help inform the management of U.S. fisheries. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office has waived the requirement for vessels with Northeast fishing permits to carry the monitors through April 4. NOAA said additional extensions would be evaluated every week. The rule changes is one of the emergency measures NOAA is using to address fishery observer coverage during the coronavirus outbreak, the agency said. NOAA said in a statement that the health and well-being of “fishermen, observers and supporting staff is not only a human health concern, but also essential to securing our nation's seafood production.”

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Mar 30 (ANI/ BusinessWire India): In response to the growing seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic that has engulfed the world and now challenges the Indian healthcare systems and economy alike, the Marico Innovation Foundation launches the first of its kind grand challenge #Innovate2BeatCOVID.   With this dynamic format, Marico Innovation Foundation and A.T.E Chandra Foundation & Harsh Mariwala in his personal capacity have come together to offer a total grant value of Rs. 2.5 crores. The program calls out MedTech entrepreneurs, corporates and innovators from across the nation to meaningfully contribute towards mitigating the risk of the outbreak.   The purpose of the grand challenge is to combat short-supply of ventilators, personal protective equipment and other respiratory solutions that can aid the medical fraternity. They are looking for existing innovative solutions that can be modified and scaled immediately. As the pandemic progresses, the grand challenge may expand to other items of critical need in consultation with medical experts.   Padma Vibhushan Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar, Governing Council Chairperson of the Marico Innovation Foundation, is confident that this unique and timely initiative will help bring enormous value.   "COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented global crisis. We must create and deploy breakthrough technologies on a war footing and on a huge scale. We at Marico Innovation Foundation have fueled purposeful innovations in all walks of life in India for close to two decades now. But this pandemic requires specific solutions here and now," said Raghunath Mashelkar.   "There will be a demand for a number of interventions, but we are focusing on two critical items for which there will be burgeoning demand, namely, ventilators and personal protection equipment. Through this grand challenge initiative, we are igniting the creative instinct of Indian innovators, who, we are confident, will rise to the challenge of providing novel solutions, which will be affordable, simple, safe, scalable and sustainable," added Mashelkar.   "The effects of the pandemic are drastic on an already stressed world economy and the overstretched Indian Healthcare system. The medical community's contribution and our government's efforts have been commendable thus far but they need more hands-on deck. The time is right for us to step in and play a catalytic role by enabling India's best innovative minds to contribute meaningfully towards easing the healthcare community pressure and help save lives," said Harsh Mariwala, Founder of Marico Innovation Foundation & Chairman of Marico Ltd.   "The need of the hour is to create an opportunity for collaboration and build an ecosystem led support so that innovators are not bound by challenges of access or ability to scale. He goes on to add, "Marico Innovation Foundation has always been at the forefront of enabling innovation, so it's only natural that we would like to extend our experience and expertise and equity to innovators who can contribute to beat Covid 19! In the same breath, I urge all of you to join us in our endeavor by extending support in the best of your capacity," added Mariwala.   "Our large and high-density population, combined with a fragile healthcare system has potential to create massive stress however well prepared we might be. This initiative will aim to contribute towards destressing critical healthcare needs in terms of medical equipment and protective gear for our frontline healthcare workers," Amit Chandra, Vice-Chairperson, Marico Innovation Foundation, and Chairman Bain Capital's India.   "Such Innovations could be invaluable both in fighting COVID-19 and also bringing affordable healthcare to India over longer-term," added Chandra.   While the window for Innovations is open for 30 days starting from 29th March 2020, we would highly encourage early responses, given the urgency in saving lives and give appropriate weightages while giving awards. The start-ups and entities that are "launch-ready" will be shortlisted by the eminent jury members Chaired by Dr. R. A. Mashelkar. MIF will be supporting them over the immediate and longer-term.

__ Listen to article
 New York, March 30, 2020 --The Committee to Protect Journalists today launched the #FreeThePress campaign to call for the unconditional release of all jailed journalists to ensure their safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 For the past four years, CPJ's annual census has found a record high number of journalists in jail because of their work -- at least 250. Those journalists now face a potential death sentence. The World Health Organization has said prisoners are particularly vulnerable to the virus, as self-isolation in jail is impossible, and prisoners are routinely denied medical treatment.
 "CPJ has long held the view that jailing journalists for what they publish, broadcast, or write is a violation of international law," said Joel Simon, CPJ's executive director. "But our current appeal is of a humanitarian nature. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly through prisons. We urge world leaders to take quick and decisive action to free all journalists behind bars, as a matter of life and death."
 CPJ also published a petition and an open letter to world leaders demanding the immediate release of imprisoned journalists. The campaign will feature video messages from formerly imprisoned journalists. The campaign will culminate on World Press Freedom Day, May 3, 2020.
 CPJ's coronavirus response page includes news coverage of journalists being arrested, assaulted, or censored for their work on the virus, as well as Q&A; interviews with reporters on the front line. CPJ Emergencies is regularly updating its physical, digital, and psychosocial safety advice, which is available in more than 15 languages, and journalists and newsrooms can submit questions to CPJ's safety experts.
 CPJ suggests the hashtag #FreeThePress on social media.

The change from ATP—the players’ union‚ to ATP—the commercial entity‚ was accompanied inevitably by the emergence of a strong management team of paid executives who run the show like a business and report to the players several times a year. The tournament directors are the ones who make or break the company by providing funds that keep the carousel spinning on its merry way. Accordingly, there is constant tension between the two groups. The ATP, like Oliver Twist, is always asking for more to justify its existence and the tournament directors resist those demands and lean ever more heavily on sponsors to provide funds. Not surprisingly, many sponsors have collapsed.”

Poll strategist-turned- politician Prashant Kishor on Monday said Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, his former mentor, should "quit" for his alleged failure to provide adequate assistance to migrants returning to the state from far-off places, amid the 21-day lockdown. Kishor, who was expelled from the JD(U) headed by Kumar, two months ago, shared a disturbing video footage on his Twitter handle, where scores of people can be seen cooped up inside a structure, beating their fists against the gates and pleading that they be allowed to go home.
 With the hashtag #NitishMustQuit, Kishor wrote in Hindi, "It is a terrifying picture of government's measures to save people from coronavirus infection. Such are the arrangements in place by @NitishKumar to ensure social distancing for those who are reaching Bihar from various parts of the country after enduring untold hardships." Though the place where the video was shot was not mentioned in the tweet, it has been traced to Sareya in Guthani block of Siwan district where nearly 100 people had arrived on a bus the previous day. "The video is misleading as no one is held up at the RBT Vidyalaya in Sareya anymore. All migrants were sent off to their respective places late Sunday night," Block Development Officer Neeraj Kumar Dubey told PTI over phone.
 He also said that migrants who hailed from "far-off districts such as Madhubani and Sitamarhi" were put up at a school building where the government had proposed to set up a camp for stranded people. "They had an arduous journey from Delhi. Even after being served food and water they seemed desperate to rush to their homes and were ready to make a dash on foot.
 "This could have led to more problems so a padlock was placed on the gates to prevent their exit till vehicles were arranged for ferrying them to their respective places," the BDO stated. The school building had enough space to ensure adequate physical distance, Dubey claimed.
 "But, in sheer desperation, some of them seemed to have gathered cheek by jowl at the gates. It was unfortunate. However, thankfully they are all now at their respective villages where panchayats are ensuring that they are placed under quarantine till the time a medical examination is conducted," he added.
 Meanwhile, senior JD(U) leader and Bihar minister Ashok Choudhary slammed Kishor for his remarks and asserted that "the state government led by Nitish Kumar has been diligently, and effectively, tackling the coronavirus outbreak, placing restrictions on its own even before the lockdown was announced". "Even after the nationwide lockdown, Bihar was doing fine until Kishor's current political master Arvind Kejriwal started taking initiatives that created problems. What was Kishor doing, sitting understandably in Delhi, when AAP supporters went around spreading rumours that the lockdown will last for months together," Choudhary said.
 Kejriwal is now putting on a show by asking the migrants to stay back with assurances that he would take care of their needs, after having facilitated a mass exodus from the city, the JD(U) leader alleged. Hitting out at Kishor, he further said, "He must remember that he has a long way to go in politics. He must refrain from talking big and, instead, tell the people of Bihar what he has been doing for them in this hour of crisis, having pledged to devote his energies to the state." In February, Kishor had launched a campaign 'Baat Bihar Ki' which he described as a long-term initiative aimed at training young men and women with an aptitude for politics.

Siding with public health experts’ dire projections, President Donald Trump on Monday defended his decision to extend restrictive social distancing guidelines through the end of April, while bracing the nation for a coronavirus death toll that could exceed 100,000 people.


  “The worst that could happen is you do it too early and all of a sudden it comes back,” Trump said during a nearly hour-long call-in interview with “Fox & Friends” as members of his coronavirus task force fanned out across other media outlets to warn the virus’ spread was only just beginning.


  The comments came a day after Trump made a dramatic course reversal and announced that he would not be moving to ease the guidelines and get the economy back up and running by Easter, as he said last week he hoped to do.


  In the face of stark projections from his team and searing images of overwhelmed hospitals in his native New York City, Trump instead extended to April 30 the social distancing guidelines, which had been set to expire Monday. Many states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings.

Tom Brady made his pitch to join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before general manager Jason Licht and head coach Bruce Arians attempted to reel in the six- time Super Bowl champion. Brady signed a two-year contract with the Buccaneers after 20 seasons with the New England Patriots.
 "We had a great conversation -- Bruce and I -- we talked to him for over an hour and a half. And he made it clear in the conversation that he was very, very interested," Licht said on ESPN's "Get Up" Monday morning. "It was almost like a recruitment on his part, telling us why it would make sense for him to come to Tampa Bay. The next call we made, we signed him, but it was at that phone call that we realized, that we felt like we had him." The Buccaneers already had a quarterback, former No. 1 overall pick Jameis Winston. But Winston was in a walk year and Arians had already decided against him returning without seeing what else was out there.
 At the NFL Scouting Combine, Arians dovetailed into greater detail about the rare quarterbacks potentially in free agency, including Brady, Drew Brees and Ryan Tannehill. All three players were under consideration in what Arians summarized as "Door No. 2." Winston, the known commodity, was Door No. 1. But he led the NFL in interceptions in 2019 and didn't make the strides management and coaches expected in Arians' first season in Tampa Bay. Arians was asked if there was one quarterback he'd pick up the phone for, he chuckled and said, "Tom Brady." Licht was also quickly on board with Brady after watching film.
 "The tape showed to us that he had plenty of arm. In fact, we thought that he had an ideal arm for Bruce in his system," Licht said of Arians' notorious desire to chuck the ball downfield to stress defenses. "He can still throw it deep. We felt like the mobility was still the same as he's always had, which, he's never been able to outrun anybody. But he certainly is good in the pocket in terms of eluding pressure and with his poise and his instincts. We did not see a decline in his arm talent whatsoever. And, in fact, we feel like he could still play for over two years for us, and hopefully that's the case." Statistically, Brady was not up to his own standard last season. He was also working without Rob Gronkowski (retired) and his purported top receivers, Julian Edelman and Josh Gordon, both missed time with injuries. Gordon was eventually released.
 "We feel like there's a lot of teams that are struggling to find one really good receiver. And we have two really outstanding receivers in Mike Evans and Chris Godwin," Licht said. "Right now, there is only so much money that can go around. There are no plans to sign any other receiver at this time. Antonio (Brown) is somebody that Bruce has come out and had some words about, and Bruce knows him better than all of us. So right now, I would just say that we're focused on other areas of our team." --Field Level Media

Many states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings. Trump's impulse to reopen the country, driven by pleas from business leaders, met a sober reality check from health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, who on Sunday said the U.S. could experience between 100,000-200,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic. That warning hardened a recognition in Washington that the struggle against the coronavirus will not be resolved quickly even as Trump expressed a longing for normalcy. “It would not have been a good idea to pull back at a time when you really need to be pressing your foot on the pedal as opposed to on the brakes,\" Fauci said on CNN on Monday, describing how he and Dr....

While there are some brain-teasers to solve, they’re never as obtuse as some of Resident Evil 2’s, and the story always feels like it’s moving along at a brisker pace than its predecessor.
 There are also a lot more zombies, putting an increased emphasis on combat. It makes Resident Evil 2’s more crowded areas look sparse, particularly when out on Raccoon City’s streets.
 This focus on action, alongside the reduced number of puzzles, can really turn the game on its head depending on the difficulty level chosen.
 On lower difficulties, this can essentially help Resident Evil 3 feel almost like a thrill ride. It’s the kind of zombie-filled popcorn blockbuster you can enjoy for just a few hours, with a focus on memorable set pieces (and they really are very memorable).
 In fact, playing on the lowest difficulty setting grants Jill an assault rifle from the off.

In Fayetteville, Arkansas, stylist Scarlett Howell voluntarily canceled all appointments for at least two weeks. She’s relying in part on savings to pay her bills.


  “There’s a lot of salon owners and stylists who refuse to close until it’s mandated, and so they’re actively putting people at risk,” she said. “It’s incredibly frustrating.”


  Howell doesn’t recommend DIY cuts or coloring using professional products that are stronger and trickier than over-the-counter varieties.


  “It’s really damn hard to cut your own hair,” she said.


  Some of her regulars are paying for their canceled appointments.


  “My clients are my family,” Howell said, breaking down in tears. “It really means a lot for people to reach out.”
