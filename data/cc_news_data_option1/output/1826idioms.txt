McEnany's mic drop questions deserve to be answered, though. If the extent of the coronavirus crisis was ill-predicted by many, including a media that could hardly wait to trot out the shopworn xenophobia plot line about travel restrictions with China, why should the president be castigated by a media that has engaged in nary a moment of self-castigation over the entire matter and now pretends they were onto this all along?

Thanks to the rightful hype storm surrounding this album, they _did_ become stars in Britain -- where the album had been out for a month by the time it arrived in the States -- and they're certified legends in their native Scotland. In 2009, readers of culture newspaper _The Skinny_ even voted _100 Broken Windows_ Scotland's album of the decade above classics from Frightened Rabbit, Boards Of Canada, Franz Ferdinand, Primal Scream, Camera Obscura, and other heavy hitters. Meanwhile here in the US they had to settle for rave reviews, MTV2 rotation, and the undying love of a modest following.

Bear in mind Paramore were not doing well on a personal level at that time. We were not getting along, but all the guys were like, "That's sick, you should do that." I was like,"Whoa, OK!" I thought, yeah, this is a cool weird opportunity that I never thought I'd get. So I tracked the vocals and later the label came back and said, "Hey, we’re giving this song to a new artist of ours called B.o.B and Eminem’s gonna do a verse on it." I was like, "Holy shit, what is my life?" I was down for the ride and I'm really happy I did it. It was so bizarre. Paramore put out _Brand New Eyes_ that year so it was much more of a rock phase for the band. But sometimes you gotta just try something new.

I firmly stand by the fact that I turned down that Uzi offer. He's a sweetheart and there would have been nothing wrong with me doing a song with him. But at the end of the day, I don't want to be the kind of artist that just gets tweeted about all the time. I want people to connect with my music. That’s not a diss on anybody. I just know how the game works when an album is just full of features. I just want to be doing my own thing and if ever something else feels right or if it just feels like the right thing at the moment, then I will follow that. But otherwise, I really have to follow my gut and that Uzi thing just -- I wasn't mentally well at the time. Paramore needed a long overdue break from being out there. I just can't, I can't say yes to everything.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran says it is ready for unconditional prisoner swap talks with the United States because of fears that the coronavirus could put the lives of the prisoners at risk, Iranian media reported Sunday. An Iranian news website, Khabaronline.ir, quoted Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei as saying there is a “readiness for all prisoners” to be discuss without condition. “But the U.S. has refused to answer, so far,” said Rabiei. “We hope that as the outbreak of the Covid-19 disease threatens the lives of Iranian citizens in the U.S. prisons, the U.S. government eventually will prefer lives to politics.” Rabiei said Iran considers the U.S. government responsible for the health of the Iranian prisoners, adding that “it seems that the U.S. has more readiness to bring the situation to an end.” Rabiei did not elaborate but Iranian media in recent months said there are several Iranians in U.S. custody, including Sirous Asgari, a 60-year-old university professor. Last week, U.S. officials said they were making progress in efforts to secure the release of a detained Navy veteran in Iran. But they were also pushing back on Iranian suggestions that a swap was in the works for the imprisoned Iranian American officials have been trying to deport since last year. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy Homeland Security secretary, said Wednesday that the cases of American detainee Michael White in Iran and Asgari, the Iranian imprisoned in the United States, have never been connected. He expressed frustration with recent comments from Iranian officials that there may be a link between the two and complained that Iran had been slow to accept Asgari’s return. White, of Imperial Beach, California, was detained in July 2018 while visiting a girlfriend in Iran. He...

In quel momento c’erano numerosi ciclisti e pedoni che hanno assistito alla scena. Lo scooter, senza mai rallentare, ha zigzagato tra le persone, mettendo in pericolo la loro incolumità.

At the time, as Berninger kept name-checking the Strokes, you could imagine a "more straightforward" National album where they delved fully into the punchy rock songs they were always capable of. With "So Far Around The Bend" -- their contribution to the 2009 compilation _Dark Was The Night_ that helped codify the new indie guard of the era -- you could imagine a poppier National album that remained autumnal but grew ever so breezier, just a bit lighter on its feet. _High Violet_ wasn't any of those things. It was like a bright, simmering storm of an album, with more allowances for catharsis than on _Boxer_ but still guided by artier songwriting and aesthetic decisions. These were anthems made for, and by, people raised to be skeptical of anthems.

 Earlier, Warner had shared a video of him dancing to a Tamil song with his wife and daughter.
 While there might be a debate over Warner's dancing skills, which is often showcased in his TikTok videos, there is no denying his creativity in those videos.
 Warner is among one of the most active cricketers on the popular video-sharing platform and he always looks for innovative ideas to entertain his fans and so far it seems to be paying dividends.
 The coronavirus pandemic has brought sporting events, including cricket, across globe to a standstill and given the current situation in many parts of the world, it is hard to predict the return of sports.
 On Friday, Warner, while talking to Indian opener Rohit Sharma in an Instagram Live session, expressed his serious doubts over the future of the T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to be held in Australia from October 18 to November 15.
 "The ICC World Cup will not go ahead here by the looks of it. It will be difficult to get everyone (16 teams) together," said Warner.

Akmal was found guilty of two charges under the PCB Anti-Corruption Code and on April 27, he was banned from cricket activities till February 19, 2023. The 29-year-old has 14 days to appeal against the punishment of two three-year bans which will run concurrently and the PCB will appoint an independent adjudicator to hear it. Sources close to Akmal said he has started consulting some lawyers on the matter and will file an appeal. The PCB source said Akmal also gave conflicting statements before the Disciplinary Panel hearing on April 27. "He refused to cooperate with the Disciplinary Panel Judge who advised him to come clean and cooperate with the inquiry," the source said.

Eventually, Rachel ended up in hospital due to her drug use during and almost lost her arm and leg. She stayed in a drug unit which she says “probably saved my life.”
 While in hospital she spoke to another heroin addict who ran a self-help program and began working there, staying clean for seven years.
 It was when Rachel had a bad breakup that she relapsed and ended up in prison after being caught using again, violating her probation for a previous drug possession charge.
 After 18 months in prison, she was forced to spend three months in immigration services and was deported back to the UK, where her family had returned.
 “It was a horrible part of my life. In prison I’d been able to work outside and had a little bit of freedom, even though I was locked up. So to be put into immigration after, with absolutely nothing, was really hard.
 “I just wanted them to send me back at that point, I just wanted to get out.”
 Although she was close to her family in the UK, Rachel said she was “taken away from all her recovery friends and support network, everything I’d ever known.”
 “There weren't a lot of recovery meetings in my area at the time, so I didn’t really have any recovery support at all.”
 She ended up in a troubled relationship and continued to use heroin, until she finally asked for help.
 “I called my mum one day and said I needed help, and she got in touch with Kaleidoscope in Welshpool, which is how I got involved.”
 Rachel volunteered with the Kaleidoscope Project and was employed there as a cleaner, as well as helping to run its SMART recovery meetings.
 She had a brief relapse a year and a half ago but has been clean since, and says there will be many drug users in need of help during the current crisis.
 “Kaleidoscope have given me a lot of opportunities for training, I really latched onto them. They’ve been really good.”
 “I write down what I do for the day - you just feel better when you get up and dressed. I’m very lucky that where we live has woods and fields nearby where I can take the dog for a walk.
 “My heart goes out to people who don’t have a place to just walk around. I feel sorry for people who are at home on their own.”
 “I do have my bad days, but I’m just trying not to let it get me down.
 “If my story helps one person - I know there are people out there that need to know that help is still available even in lockdown.
 “It’s not easy when you can’t see people face-to-face, but I still get my one- to-one meetings and feel really supported.”
