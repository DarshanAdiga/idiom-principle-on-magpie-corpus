With all that professional success, it’s not too surprising, at least not to property gossips, that the Tinseltown heavy hitter has traded his spacious home in Studio City for, we presume, something much more grand and in line with his skyrocketing success. Acquired via trust in early 2013 for $2.4 million, and hardly what anyone would call a starter house, King’s now former Studio City home first came up for sale more than a year ago with an asking price just shy of $3.8 million. The price dropped to almost $3.5 million and was briefly set out for rent at $15,000 per month before it was taken off the market earlier this year only pop back up for sale with an even-more-reduced price of $3.275 million.

Two separate groups of researchers have reported large-scale genomic studies of blood cells that captured much of the variation predisposing blood cells to both common and rare diseases. One study, led by investigators at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee and the University of Montreal, conducted a meta-analysis of studies involving nearly 750,000 individuals, including nearly 200,000 that were not of European ancestry - a much-needed boost for genomic diversity in GWAS. The team identified genomic variants related to a total of 15 traits in white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. They identified a total of more than 5,500 trait-related variants. By using their multi-ethnic approach, they were able to identify nearly 100 trait-related genetic variants that were not found in the European ancestry group. The researchers concluded that "our results for hematological traits highlight the value of a more global representation of populations in genetic studies." The second study, which was conducted exclusively on samples from the UK Biobank, identified new variants in individuals of European ancestry only. The papers appeared back to back in the Sept. 3, 2020, issue of _Cell_.

West has already qualified to appear on the ballot in several states, including Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Tennessee and Utah. He didn't qualify in Ohio, Montana, West Virginia, Wisconsin and other states, though he has filed lawsuits challenging some of those decisions.

Earlier this week, Arizona resident Rasean Clayton filed a lawsuit for West to be barred from appearing on the ballot. The lawsuit accused the rapper of serving as an election spoiler and argued that state law barred him from running as an independent candidate because West is a registered Republican.

It's unclear whether Clayton has any connections to the Democratic Party. He said in a statement that he filed the legal challenge to West's campaign because he didn't want voters to be confused by seeing unqualified candidates on the ballot.

A judge has barred Kanye West from appearing on the Nov. 3 ballot in Arizona, concluding that a voter who challenged his candidacy had shown he would probably prevail and had established the possibility of an irreparable harm if the rapper’s name were to appear on the ballot. The ruling Thursday by Judge Scott McCoy said that the voter who challenged West’s bid in Arizona “established that the relative hardships favor him.” Putting West on the ballot would create confusion for voters, his lawyers argued. The decision came a day after West’s campaign turned in nearly 58,000 nominating signatures, well over the 39,000 needed to appear on the Arizona ballot. Over the last 10 days, more than 120 people living in other states have registered in Arizona as paid signature gatherers for West, who announced his presidential campaign on July 4. West has already qualified to appear on the ballot in several states, including Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Tennessee and Utah. He didn’t qualify in Ohio, Montana, West Virginia, Wisconsin and other states, though he has filed lawsuits challenging some of those decisions. Another judge ordered West’s name removed from ballots in Virginia on Thursday, finding that the rapper failed to meet a requirement that 13 people pledge support for his campaign. The judge ruled 11 of the 13 “Elector Oaths” submitted by the West campaign were invalid, including some that were “obtained by improper, fraudulent and/or misleading means.” It’s unknown whether West intends to appeal the Arizona ruling. Tim LaSota, an attorney representing West, had no immediate comment Thursday evening. Earlier this week, Arizona resident Rasean Clayton filed a lawsuit for West to be barred from appearing on the ballot. The lawsuit accused the rapper of serving as an election spoiler and argued that...

Canada's top doctor has some advice that might not go over well with everyone: Dr. Theresa Tam says people should wear a mask during sex as the pandemic continues, reports CTV News. To be clear, Tam isn't talking about relations between husbands and wives or regular, live-in partners. But for those meeting up with a new lover, a mask might be the way to go. Such couples should "consider using a mask that covers the nose and mouth," and they also should avoid "face-to-face contact or closeness," says Tam in her statement. And of course, "the lowest risk sexual activity during COVID-19 involves yourself alone," she adds, per Reuters.
