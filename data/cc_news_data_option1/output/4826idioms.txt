A Norfolk-based farm research charity is investing £120,000 per year in a new PhD programme to help emerging scientists unlock the yield secrets of East Anglia’s soils.           The Morley Agricultural Foundation (TMAF), based near Wymondham, already provides grants for research into arable crops but has now launched its first fully-funded PhD studentship, in tandem with NIAB (National Institute of Agricultural Botany) and the University of Cambridge.           The first scientist recruited to the annual programme is 25-year-old Harvey Armstrong who, after completing an integrated masters in biological sciences at Cardiff University, will now be working with Dr Tom Wood at NIAB and Dr Nik Cunniffe at the Cambridge university’s department of plant sciences, on a four-year project to investigate the effects of legume rotations on soil microbe populations.           His third supervisor will be Morley director Dr Steve Rawsthorne, who said the programme would give TMAF greater impact in its funding objectives, by being able to choose PhD projects rather than funding “ad hoc” applications – although those would also still be supported.           “One of the things that Morley has done for many years is to seek to fund research with application to agriculture,” he said. “We will continue to do that, but one of things we lacked was the ability to direct the type of research that was being undertaken in the PhDs because these were all ad-hoc applications.           “The Morley PhD Studentship is another string to our bow and it is a really valuable one because it gives us the ability to direct the kind of research that we are funding.           “The board really liked the feel of this inaugural proposal because it overlapped with the interest of the Morley board. There has been a lot of focus on soil quality and things that affect soil, such as tillage and so on, so the idea that we could fund a pHD studentship that was researching the effects of cropping on the microbiome in the soil was really exciting to us This has been a win/win for everyone.”

The patent-in-suit is United States Patent No. 7,016,942 (the ’942 patent) for “Dynamic Hosting.” In particular, the patent-in-suit, according to the complaint, “disclosed…a method for dynamic hosting, which is where a computer connects to a server in a network as a client and one of the clients begins to act as the host or server for the other clients, thereby no longer using the server to function as the host or server for the other clients.” As a result, the plaintiff stated “[t]his allows for a novel solution to a technological problem, i.e., ‘Offloading server tasks to specific clients’ and ‘creating self-sustaining dynamic client-server configurations independent of the server to which the clients originally connected.’”

My point about the Josh Pitts vulnerability is that he reported that to Apple in February 2018, before these changes in certificate checks took place (if I'm right as to timescale). Although specific to Universal binaries, that would have been a time when Apple's engineers were starting to focus their attention on exactly those, knowing that ARM systems were in the pipeline. I think that was the time that Apple was looking seriously at how those new systems would handle signatures, and the vulnerability was notified at a critical time in that process. Apple's response to the vulnerability was a stern ignoring, because by then the future, with these frequent checks, was already being built in. So that's part of how we got here. At the time, there was a bit of the "so who uses Universal binaries now?", which with the wisdom of hindsight reads very differently.

By the time I read _Hillbilly Elegy_ , the movie was already in production, and I remember thinking then, _How do you turn this into a movie, into a three-act narrative?_ The appeal of Vance's book, at least to me, is not _the events_ that occur. Other than his Mamaw (grandmother) lighting his Papaw (grandfather) on fire early in their troubled marriage (when Vance's mother was still a child), nothing that _happens_ is terribly original or anything a whole lot of us haven't experienced.

SOMEDAY A PARK: This aerial view of the Montlake dump shows the extent of the area that will be turned into a recreation area when it is filled and leveled as seen on Feb. 2, 1965. The University of Washington Board of Regents Friday gave the city permission to continue dumping city-collected garbage into the land-fill area until about March 1, 1966. The deadline earlier had been July I. The site will not be reopened to public dumping, how-ever. The regents approved the extension on condition the city reduces odors and discourages the scavanging seagulls which frequent the site. The University believes the dump will be an asset to the area when if is converted to a recreation area. This view is northeast across the Laurelhurst District. (Johnny Closs / The Seattle Times)
