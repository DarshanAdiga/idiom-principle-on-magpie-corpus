 # FDA approves COVID-19 saliva test developed at Yale in partnership with the NBA, NBPA

 A saliva-based COVID-19 test developed by researchers at Yale in partnership and funding from the NBA and National Basketball Players Association was approved on Saturday for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
 Called SalivaDirect, the test uses saliva samples to detect COVID-19.
 ‚ÄúProviding this type of flexibility for processing saliva samples to test for COVID-19 infection is groundbreaking in terms of efficiency and avoiding shortages of crucial test components like reagents,‚Äù FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn said in a statement. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs authorization is another example of the FDA working with test developers to bring the most innovative technology to market in an effort to ensure access to testing for all people in America."
 In a news release, the FDA said the Yale School of Public Health submitted data that meets the FDA‚Äôs criteria for emergency use authorization. SalivaDirect results have been validated with reagents and ‚Äúyields similar outcomes as (nasopharyngeal) swabbing," Yale said in a news release.
 Researchers have been looking for a COVID-19 test that is less invasive than the nasopharyngeal swabbing method and less expensive which can lead to widespread testing and make up for shortages of other testing methods.
 SalivaDirect is non-invasive and requires just a small sample, reducing risks for healthcare workers collecting samples.
 Anne Wyllie, assistant professor and associate research scientist at Yale School of Public Health, said she expects labs to charge about $10 for the test.
 In late June, NBA players who opted into the program began submitting samples for the study.
 ‚ÄúIn talking to our partners at the NBA, we heard from them, that, in addition to finding less invasive testing solutions for its players and staff, there is a strong desire on their part to give back to the public and especially help low-income communities, so it became immediately clear that our interests were aligned,‚Äù Nathan Grubaugh, assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said in a statement in June.
 NBPA medical chief Joe Rogowski said: ‚ÄúNot only does it offer the potential for players to have an alternative method of testing within the NBA Campus in Orlando, but more importantly it allows them to leverage their regular testing to make a larger contribution to public health in the fight against this virus."
