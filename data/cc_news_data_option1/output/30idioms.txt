BOONE COUNTY, Ky. (FOX19) - Boone County Commissioner Jesse Brewer wants to make the county a so-called ‘Second Amendment sanctuary’ in order, he says, to protect gun rights for people in the area. Brewer says there’s no “current infringements” on gun rights in the state, but he adds that could change. “There are some legislators across the state that are trying to pass what are known as red flag laws,” he told FOX19 NOW, “and red flag laws can vary, but they do take a bite out of the Second Amendment and they do infringe upon those rights.” Red flag laws allow police or family members to request court-ordered removal of firearms from a person they believe presents a danger to themselves or others. It isn’t immediately clear what effect Brewer’s proposed resolution would have, but he says it would have the teeth to challenge any perceived infringement upon Second Amendment rights. If passed, it would be the second such resolution in Kentucky. Harlan County became a ‘sanctuary’ in December. Not everyone thinks it’s a good idea. Boone County Attorney Robert Peace says the resolution would be a “political expression of support” for the Second Amendment. Enforcement of the ‘sanctuary’ order, Peace adds, could fly in the face of a law passed by the Kentucky legislature in 2012 which says no local political body can be involved in the regulation of firearms. If they do, Peace says, those bodies can be sued. And if they should lose, that body—here Boone County—would be responsible for paying court costs.Brewer doesn’t think that will be a problem, as Republicans currently hold both chambers of the Kentucky legislature, meaning no Second Amendment infringements will be passed. Still, he says he wants the county to send a message to state lawmakers. “We're looking to say, 'Hey, if you try to do something, Frankfort, we're here and we're going to fight you.’” The county commission will be voting on the resolution Jan. 14.

Centre back Sakho pulled his hamstring in Wednesdays 1-1 league draw with Norwich City, leaving Hodgson with a selection headache ahead of Sundays FA Cup third-round meeting with Championship side second tier Derby County.Defenders Patrick van Aanholt thigh, Scott Dann leg, Joel Ward knee and Jeffrey Schlupp hip are all out injured while Gary Cahill is back training following a knee issue. It injury list has been added to with Sakho pulling his hamstring against Norwich so hes going to be missing for a considerable period of time, Hodgson told a news conference.Cahill has done his first training session today which is positive, so maybe its one in, one out in terms of training. Hodgson said forward Wilfried Zaha would miss out due to a knock that he sustained against Norwich.Zaha played with an injury and it was touch and go if he was going to be on the field. It would be unlikely if we would do that to him again on Sunday, Hodgson added. We would want to put more resources into the FA Cup if we had them. Its a great competition but we have to balance whats available to us with what we can do, take the soundings from our sports science people and weigh the possible risks.Former England and Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney could feature for Derby having made his debut in Thursdays 2-1 win over Barnsley.

Long before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went on television and Twitter on Friday to make the case for the U.S. decision to assassinate top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, he had the powerful military commander squarely in his sights.Back in 2015, when Pompeo was a congressman for Kansas advocating regime charge in Iran while the Obama administration pursued engagement, he accused Soleimani, considered the second most powerful person in Iran, of having the blood of hundreds of American service members on his hands, a refrain he repeated on Friday after the U.S. air strike in Baghdad. In July 2017, by which time he had become director of President Donald Trumps Central Intelligence Agency, Pompeos stance on regime change may have been less overt, but when asked at the Aspen Security Forum whether regime change in Iran was a realistic or viable option, he repliedThe folks who are causing the mischief - Qassem Soleimani and his gang - werent elected. Those are the folks that we are deadly focused on making sure dont continue to maintain capacity and power. Later that year, Pompeo announced he had sent a letter to Soleimani and other Iranian leaders over Irans increasingly threatening behavior in Iraq, warning the United States would hold both them accountable for any attacks on American interests in Iraq by forces that are under their control.We wanted to make sure he and the leadership in Iran understood that in a way that was crystal clear, Pompeo told the Reagan National Defense Forum in Southern California. After hearing via Iranian media that Soleimani refused to open the letter, Pompeo added Didnt break my heart to be honest with you.As secretary of state, a position he took up in the first part of 2018, Pompeo pursued a notably more hawkish approach to Iran than his predecessors and frequently named Soleimani in speeches and interviews. When Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, negotiated by the Obama administration, Pompeo was one of the most vocal proponents of the maximum pressure campaign that saw the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018.Pompeo said on Friday the strike that killed Soleimani in Baghdad was aimed at disrupting an imminent attack that would have endangered Americans in the Middle East. In interviews on Fox News and CNN, Pompeo declined to discuss details of the alleged threat but said there was an intelligence based assessment that Soleimani was plotting action in the Middle East region that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk.In a tweet, Trump said Soleimani had killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more.

 The actress has reportedly hired an expert in order to teach her "prison lingo" with the news she's facing a max 45-year sentence for her role in the 2019 college admissions scandal. According to a source close to Loughlin she has also begun practicing martial arts with the hopes of warding off "potential buillies."
 The source told Radar Online, "She’s knuckling down, learning the lingo and practicing martial arts to give off the impression she’s tough and to ward off potential bullies,” adding that Lori “knows there will be plenty of them in federal prison. Prison is going to be sink or swim and Lori doesn’t intend to sit back and take the abuse without a fight." The source concluded saying, "Besides the physical training she’s getting lots of advice from prison professors on how to earn one’s keep behind bars. It’s a sure sign she knows deep down she’s facing an inevitable stretch and will need to be prepared."

Hundreds cheered as the three beauty contest finalists strolled out into the middle of the grounds and raised their painted trunks to the judges -- symbols of all that is admired and denounced at Nepals annual elephant festival.With her toenails painted red and a lotus on her trunk, 35-year-old Buffkali took the trophy at the end of the nine-day festival that ended Friday. But while elephants were judged on how well they were decorated and groomed, officials were also meant to check their heads and ears for signs of beatings.Many outsiders were also looking for signs of abuse at the festival, which has been held in the Chitwan district, home to Nepals most important conservation area and a lucrative tourist destination, since 2004.Elephants are worshipped as the Hindu god Ganesh in Nepal and big crowds attended the festival -- where over 25 of the creatures took part in football, polo and races, as well as the beauty pageant and a picnic where they were served bananas and sugarcane.Deepak Bhattarai, chairman of the local hotel association that organises the festival, told AFP the event aims to highlight elephants relationship with humans and to become more elephant friendly every year.It is exciting. I brought my son here to watch the elephants, you don’t get to see them like this every day, said one visitor Sheetal Karki.But the festival has also come under fire for abuse, with mahouts using sticks or bullhooks to force the elephants to play.Surajan Shrestha of the local Animal Rights Club said activists have been working with organisers to ease concerns and had eliminated the use of bullhooks during games this year.But we can still see abuse off the field … I hope our campaign will pressure the organisers to take steps to improve (the festival), he said.It’s 2020 – the Chitwan authorities need to stop treating elephants like it’s 1820, said Jason Baker, a vice president of PETA in a statement on Thursday.They should focus tourism on the amazing local culture and leave animals alone, he added.It’s impossible to ride elephants and force them to play these meaningless games without abuse.Another popular event in Nepal, elephant polo championships, were halted in 2016 with organisers feeling pressure over the treatment of the animals.

“You tell the passage of time with clothing,” says Powell, who has earned 14 Oscar nominations and three wins, most recently for last year’s “The Favourite.” “The gangsters in this film were a lot less flashy and ostentatious than in other movies Marty has done. That was the main brief, especially for Frank Sheeran, who has to be under the radar. A lot of it for him was about blending in and not standing out too much.”
 Even sound came into play. Oscar-winning sound mixer Tom Fleischman experimented extensively to figure out how to de-age De Niro’s voice. “It had to be very subtle,” Fleischman says. “I tried adjusting the pitch of his voice in ‘The Irishman’ to a couple of scenes in (De Niro’s 1982 film) ‘The King of Comedy,’ but it sounded a little bit like he was on helium. What (sound editor) Phil Stockton ended up doing eventually was going in and editing out a lot of the breaths and the grunts and guttural things that De Niro does with his voice, particularly as he’s gotten older. Then we just did a subtle pitch change. That worked very well.”
 As software improves and computing power increases, you can expect Hollywood to continue to push the envelope of de-aging. Earlier this year, with the sci- fi action film “Gemini Man,” director Ang Lee and his team used motion capture and other techniques to create a fully digital clone of 50-year-old Will Smith as he looked at 23. In what some may argue is a bridge too far, visual-effects artists have even reached beyond the grave; the late actor Peter Cushing was digitally revived for 2016’s “Star Wars: Rogue One,” and outtakes from Carrie Fisher’s performance in “The Last Jedi” before her 2016 death were used as building blocks for “The Rise of Skywalker,” now in theaters. Meanwhile, James Dean, who died in 1955, is slated to be posthumously cast, via CGI, in an upcoming drama called “Finding Jack,” news that was widely greeted with dismay.
 But all the digital technology in the world will be for naught if it fails to preserve the analog soul of a performance. With “The Irishman,” what Helman is most proud of is that his work enabled Scorsese and his cast to shoot the film largely as they would have in the old days. For all of the countless hours of work that went into de-aging De Niro, Pesci and Pacino, he says, at the heart of it, the performances belong entirely to the actors.
 “The achievement here is allowing the actors to do what they do without the technology being in the middle of it, working in that organic way with the technology away from them,” he says. “I think it’s just going to keep going and we’re just going to keep trying to make this better and better. I just can’t wait for actors to look at this and say, ‘I don’t have to wear markers anymore. I don’t have to spend two hours in makeup. I can do what I was hired to do, which is perform.’ “
 In that spirit, Helman hopes that when you watch the “Irishman,” you don’t try to figure out how the magic trick was done. Don’t think about the 1,750 visual effects shots. Don’t contemplate the hours that De Niro spent in wardrobe fittings and makeup sessions. “The point of the whole thing,” Helman says, “is you shouldn’t be sitting there thinking about how we did it.”

When Kea Turner's 74-year-old grandmother checked into Virginia's Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital with advanced lung cancer, she landed in the oncology unit where every patient was monitored by a bed alarm.      "Even if she would slightly roll over, it would go off," Turner said. Small movements - such as reaching for a tissue - would set off the alarm, as well. The beeping would go on for up to 10 minutes, Turner said, until a nurse arrived to shut it off.      Tens of thousands of alarms shriek, beep and buzz every day in every U.S. hospital. All sound urgent, but few require immediate attention or get it.      Intended to keep patients safe alerting nurses to potential problems, they also create a riot of disturbances for patients trying to heal and get some rest.      Nearly every machine in a hospital is now outfitted with an alarm - infusion pumps, ventilators, bedside monitors tracking blood pressure, heart activity and a drop in oxygen in the blood. Even beds are alarmed to detect movement that might portend a fall. The glut of noise means that the medical staff is less likely to respond.      Alarms have ranked as one of the top 10 health technological hazards every year since 2007, according to the research firm ECRI Institute. That could mean staffs were too swamped with alarms to notice a patient in distress or that the alarms were misconfigured. The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, warned the nation about the "frequent and persistent" problem of alarm safety in 2013. It now requires hospitals to create formal processes to tackle alarm system safety, but there is no national data on whether progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of false and unnecessary alarms.      The commission has estimated that of the thousands of alarms going off throughout a hospital every day, an estimated 85% to 99% do not require clinical intervention. Staff, facing widespread "alarm fatigue," can miss critical alerts, leading to patient deaths. Patients may get anxious about fluctuations in heart rate or blood pressure that are perfectly normal, the commission said.      And bed alarms, a recent arrival, can lead to immobility and dangerous loss of muscle mass when patients are terrified that any movement will set off the bleeps.      An 'epidemic of immobility'   In the past 30 years, the number of medical devices that generate alarms has risen from about 10 to nearly 40, said Priyanka Shah, a senior project engineer at ECRI Institute. A breathing ventilator alone can emit 30 to 40 different noises, she said.      In addition to triggering bed alarms, patients who move in bed may set off false alarms from pulse oximeters, which measure the oxygen in a patient's blood, or carbon dioxide monitors, which measure the level of the gas in someone's breath, she said.      Shah said she has seen hospitals reduce unneeded alarms, but doing so is "a constant work in progress."      'Cry wolf phenomenon'   Maria Cvach, an alarm expert and director of policy management and integration for Johns Hopkins Health System, found that on one step-down unit (a level below intensive care) in the hospital in 2006, an average of 350 alarms went off per patient per day, from the cardiac monitor alone.      She said no international standard exists for what these alarms sound like, so they vary by manufacturer and device. "It's really impossible for the staff to identify by sound everything that they hear," she said.      The flood of alarms creates a "cry wolf phenomenon," Cvach said. The alarms are "constantly calling for help. The staff look at them. They say that's just a false alarm - they may ignore the real alarm."      Bed alarms, for example, are meant to summon nurses so they can supervise patients to walk safely. But research has shown that the use of alarms doesn't prevent falls. Nursing staffs are often stretched thin and don't reach the bedside before a patient hits the ground.      Meanwhile, patients may feel immobilized at a time when even a few hundred steps per day could significantly improve their recovery. Immobility in the hospital can create other problems for patients, leaving them with often irreversible functional decline, research has shown.      Bed alarms have proliferated since 2008, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declared hospital falls should "never" happen and stopped paying for injuries related to those falls. After that policy change, the odds of nurses using a bed alarm increased 2.3 times, according to a study led by Dr. Ronald Shorr, director of the Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida. The alarms have become a standard feature in new hospital beds.      But Shorr noted that, in contrast, bed alarms are being removed from other settings: In 2017, CMS began discouraging their widespread use in nursing homes, arguing that audible bed or chair alarms may be considered a "restraint" if the resident "is afraid to move to avoid setting off the alarm."

The owner of Sunnyvale Ford in the heart of Silicon Valley raved about response to the 2021 Mustang Mach-E SUV at a dealership located just blocks from Tesla, the rival high-profile electric carmaker led by controversial CEO Elon Musk. “I just think the market is ripe and it’s ready for something other than Tesla. Our all-electric SUV with a 300 mile range is super cool and functional.”
 Fuentes noted that the high-efficiency vehicle will allow drivers to use special commuter lanes in the notoriously congested West Coast highways. “It’s like the e-ticket at Disneyland,” he said.
 More than one in four buyers of the now sold-out first edition version of the Mach-E lives in California.
 Yet response from other parts of America to the vehicle has been immediate.
 Tom Nardone, 49, an entrepreneur from Birmingham, Michigan, placed his $500 reservation for a base model 2021 Mustang Mach-E with all-wheel drive within hours of watching the unveiling on YouTube. “I’m interested in efficiency. I like the idea of a Tesla but I don’t trust Tesla. I would’ve bought a Chevrolet Bolt but it wasn’t very attractive. Right now I’m driving a 2020 Camry hybrid. I love it. This new vehicle will replace my wife’s 2017 Dodge Journey.”
 Mike Van Camp, 36, an industrial metal fabrication contractor from Schereville, Indiana, chose the Mustang Mach-E GT nearly two decades after buying a 2001 GT yellow convertible. “I was looking for something sporty and considered getting a Jeep Gladiator. But this, it’s the first of its kind and I can say I was there when it first came out.”
 Anne Thimm, 58, a retired analyst from Alexandria, Virginia, laughs when she talks about her love of Mustang.
 “Back in 2001, the Mustang Bullitt came out and I just fell in love with that car. I walked into a Ford dealership and the guy said to me, ‘Honey, don’t you think that’s a little too much for you?’ Like, really? I was just floored. I was ready to pay cash for that car. So I walked right out and went to another Ford dealership 15 miles down the road and got my Bullitt. I loved that car.”
 She sadly parted with the Mustang to transport her four dogs.
 “I mourn that car every day,” Thimm said. “Now we can get a Mustang to haul our dogs and also have electric. When I saw the Mach-E, I thought, ‘Oh my God, it checks all our boxes.’ It’s fun and it has plenty of room.”
 Soon she will replace her Toyota Highlander hybrid with a first edition red Mach-E.
 Matt Stanford, general manager at Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor, said he has totaled 70 orders for the Mach-E already.
 “And I actually ordered one for myself, a black GT,” he confessed. “I have professors who have ordered, doctors, Ford employees, folks looking for an answer to the combustible engine — people concerned about their carbon footprint. I’ve got folks in their mid-20s all the way up to their late 60s.”
 This is new territory for Ford, said Stanford, whose uncles founded the dealership and whose family members sell cars. “Ford, instead of sticking its toe in the pool, jumped completely into the deep end. Tesla has owned the market. Tesla is just killing it. There’s a sexiness to the Tesla vehicle. It’s a status symbol, almost a way of life for some people. It’s a sleek, nice looking car. So Ford’s going at ‘em.”
 First editions are selling mostly in Carbonized Gray at 38%, Grabber Blue Metallic at 35% and Rapid Red at 27%. More than 80% of U.S. customers are reserving Mach-E with an extended range battery. About 55% are buying all- wheel drive. Almost 30% are choosing the top-model GT.
 The Dearborn automaker doesn’t reveal the number of first editions sold but does note that the company has promised only 50,000 Mach-E vehicles that will be sold for the first 12 months in the U.S., Canada and Europe, and then other markets including China, Ford spokeswoman Emma Bergg confirmed.
 There are four other trim levels besides the first edition. A potential tax credit of $7,500 will be applied to the prices below:
 — Select, from $43,895
 — Premium, from $50,600
 — First Edition, from $59,900
 — California Route 1, from $52,400

Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinhos worst fears were realised when the club confirmed on Friday that striker Harry Kane suffered a torn hamstring during the defeat at Southampton. Kane, who has netted 27 goals for Spurs and England this season, was forced off late in the 1-0 loss on Wednesday after injuring his left hamstring scoring a disallowed goal.Mourinho said he believed the news would be bad when he addressed media ahead of Tottenhams FA Cup third-round clash at Middlesbrough on Sunday. The club later said Kane had indeed torn a hamstring -- an injury that usually means around one month on the sidelines.If you ask me just my feeling -- good news or bad news -- I am more on bad news than good news, thats my feeling, Mourinho said earlier when asked about Kane. What the player felt, Harry Kane leaving a match, the way he did it, he didnt think twice, it didnt take him two seconds to realise the severity of the situation.I think were going to lose him for some period. Every minute of every game he doesnt play we miss him but I dont want to be crying all the time. Kane has been injury-free this season but had two lengthy lay-offs last season with ankle ligament injuries.Another spell without Kane will be a major blow to Tottenham who are struggling to stay in the hunt for the top four having fallen six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Everybody knows the importance of Harry in the squad. I think irreplaceable, Mourinho said.The good news for Mourinho is that forward Son Heung-min will be back from suspension for the trip to Middlesbrough after missing three games following a red card against Chelsea. Tottenham are also without Danny Rose calf, Ben Davies ankle and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris elbow while midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, who limped off against Southampton, is being assessed for a hip injury.

The summer will be one that Ramos, or anyone involved with the team, won’t ever forget.
 And in case you need a brief refresher, Lawrence — after winning the state championship — was just five outs away from an expense-paid trip to Shelby, North Carolina and the American Legion World Series before a talented team from Shrewsbury came back to win the Northeast Regional final.
 “It was just an amazing year,” said Ramos. “A lot of new friendships, a lot of memories. I think what stood out was the unity of the team. Once we won the state championship, the support from the city was just amazing. People thought that we were for real at that point. They felt like ‘okay this team is trying to do something special.’
 “And we did.”
 Of course, baseball is only a fraction of what makes this story so special.
 Ramos paid an estimated $6,000 out of pocket to revive a dead Legion team — without a sponsor — two years ago, and even picked up driving for Uber to pay umpires, just to give kids in such a baseball-rich city an opportunity to play during the summer. During their state championship-winning run, the team carpooled to their games in a van Ramos borrowed from his church.
 Assistant coach Kevin Bartlett, who ran the Legion team for almost a decade, referred to Ramos as, “A gift from God.”
 That’s why there were so many tears when the run came to an end.

The Wi-Fi Alliance cites industry analysts who see a clear path forward for the 6GHz band, and broad industry support for the new spectral allocation would seem to back that up.
 "If the regulatory landscape permits, we expect companies to move forward aggressively with products that operate in 6GHz because they understand the tremendous value brought to their customers by this portion of unlicensed spectrum," said Phil Solis, research director at IDC.
 "The 6GHz band will perhaps be the most disruptive boon for Wi-Fi users in the last 20 years," said Vijay Nagarajan, vice president, Wireless Communications and Connectivity Division at Broadcom. "This swath of spectrum, when coupled with Wi-Fi, will power new consumer experiences on smartphones, AR/VR devices and wearables we haven't even yet invented."
 "The ground-breaking potential of extending the already transformative characteristics of Wi-Fi 6 into the 6GHz band is hard to overstate," says Rahul Patel, senior vice president and general manager, Connectivity & Networking at Qualcomm. "We applaud Wi-Fi Alliance's leadership in unleashing a new era of high-speed, low-latency Wi-Fi 6 experiences for the 6GHz band."
 The Wi-Fi Alliance is currently working on interoperability testing for new, Wi-Fi 6E connections, and predicts that consumer-grade access points and smart phones will be among the first devices to jump on board once regulators make the additional spectrum available.

Months after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai reiterated his support for plans to allocate more than 1,200 megahertz of unlicensed spectrum on the 6GHz band for Wi-Fi usage, the Wi-Fi industry is moving to hit the ground running with the additional real estate in 2020. To start, the Wi-Fi Alliance, fresh off of rebranding the newest generation of Wi-Fi technology as "Wi-Fi 6," is now introducing new "Wi-Fi 6E" terminology to help identify products capable of taking advantage of the additional spectrum.
 The Wi-Fi Alliance says that 6GHz is well suited to facilitate Wi-Fi's continued growth due to its adjacency to the 5GHz band, where Wi-Fi already operates. The 6GHz band also offers accessibility to clear spectrum with less interference from legacy Wi-Fi 4 or Wi-Fi 5 devices on the 2.4GHz band, as well as a greater availability of wider channel sizes -- enough to accommodate 14 additional 80MHz channels and seven additional 160MHz channels.
 "This band is currently populated by microwave services that are used to support utilities, public safety and wireless backhaul," said Pai. "But studies have shown that sharing this band with unlicensed operations is feasible, and can put massive amounts of new spectrum into the hands of consumers."
 With a total frequency range of 1,200MHz \-- up from 70MHz on the 2.4GHz band and 500MHz on the 5GHz band -- the 6GHz band could play a key role in the development of high-bandwidth applications that require faster data throughput, like 4K video streams and virtual reality.
 "6GHz will help address the growing need for Wi-Fi spectrum capacity to ensure Wi-Fi users continue to receive the same great user experience with their devices," said Edgar Figueroa, president and CEO of the Wi-Fi Alliance. "Wi-Fi Alliance is introducing Wi-Fi 6E now to ensure the industry aligns on common terminology, allowing Wi-Fi users to identify devices that support 6GHz operation as the spectrum becomes available."

It was a lonely feeling.
 When Hank Snow flew back home from Vietnam, wearing his Army uniform, he couldn't understand why no one sat next to him on the plane and the rows all around him were empty.
 But he soon figured it out.
 "No one wanted to go anywhere near me because I was a Vietnam veteran. People lined up at the airport to spit on us," said Snow, now 75, from his Taunton home.
 Snow, who said he was exposed extensively to Agent Blue in Vietnam has been in and out of the hospital recently. He has Parkinson's and has difficulty walking or even standing and respiratory ailments make it difficult to breath.
 The love of his life died five years ago. He has two sons and a grandson who are very important to him but the stretches between time spent with them can feel empty, he said Thursday, sitting in his living room in an armchair he can't get out of without assistance.
 It's a lonely feeling.
 But he's not alone.
 Fellow veteran Hank Mello of the Taunton Area Vietnam Veterans Association sent out an email on Dec. 29 to all TAVVA members asking them to consider calling or visiting Snow or sending him a card to brighten his day. Snow said Thursday he hasn't gotten any calls or visits yet.
 So, Mello said he'd like to extend that invitation to all of Taunton. Mello said he thinks it would be wonderful if people picked up the phone and called Snow to thank him for his service and ask him a little about his experiences and really listen.
 It would be great if Snow's phone rang off the hook, Mello said.
 "That would be a nice problem to have," Mello said.
 Snow, who has lived in Taunton for many years, enlisted when he was 19.
 "The country needed people. I said, 'I'll do my share'," said Snow, a detachment commander who was awarded a Bronze Star.
 Snow gets quiet when he talks about Vietnam. There's nothing romantic about war. Sitting on the front lines, he was shot at every day. He watched friends die and he killed people. Everyone was a civilian and everyone was a soldier.
 "We didn't want to be there and they didn't want us there," he said.
 He does have one happy memory of a band some of the guys formed, amid the horrors of war. Talking about that music still puts a smile on his face and a shine back in his eyes.
 The soldiers called the plane they headed home on the "freedom bird," Snow said.
 When he got back to Boston, after six years in the military including one year in Vietnam, he remembers vividly what happened at the airport.
 "I picked up my duffel bag and the bottom fell out from dry rot and too many years. I said, 'There goes everything on the floor. I've got to pick it up again'," Snow said.
 And pick up the pieces he did.
 He went back to his job running the drafting room at FM Global in Attleboro, where he worked for 21 years until he had to retire due to his deteriorating health.
 "It was the best job ever because I did something every day using my hands," he said.
 But the freedom bird had not freed him of his memories of the war.
 He remembers waking up on the floor of his bedroom in the middle of the night terrified because police sirens were going by.
 And he remembers being told to forget about it. It's over. But that's not how it works. You can't just get over it, he said.
 And then the headaches started. At first he didn't make the connection to Agent Blue, one of the defoliants the United States used in Vietnam that has been linked to a variety of illnesses.
 He winces when he pictures himself emptying it out of a can, coming into contact with it over and over.
 "They said, 'Go ahead and use it, it won't hurt humans,'" so they pumped it and sprayed it with abandon.
 Snow, who is on a VA disability, said the Army has never officially stated his health problems are related to Agent Blue. But he has no doubt, he said.
 "It's killing me," he said softly.
 Hank Mello said his friend is facing some difficult times but he still sees a twinkle in his eye if given half a chance.
 "I think he tries to stay positive but it's tough. He's really dependent on people and that drives him crazy. But he's still got a great love of life," Mello said.
 Snow said calls would mean a lot if they come from people who really mean thanks.
 He has a reason to be cautious.
 When he got back from Vietnam, he got it from all sides, the anti-war protesters, older veterans who showed contempt that Vietnam veterans "lost their war," as if the young men, barely more than boys, who risked their lives for a war not of their making were to blame for any of it. Then there was the Agent Blue his own country unleashed on its own soldiers.
 He remembers being in a bank once wearing his Bronze Star and a man said to him, "Were you too stupid to know how to get out of it?"
 Snow wanted to say, "We did this for you guys. Thanks a lot."
 Snow has no interest in re-writing history or weighing in on the politics of the war. None of that was ever up to him, he said.
 "I'm proud of the fact that at least I had the guts to serve," Snow said.
 He said recently at a veterans event he met an older woman who said to him, "I remember how we treated you guys. I'm sorry." It was surprising and it meant something to him.
 "It was like she was apologizing for everyone," he said.
 If you'd like to thank Hank Snow for his service, call him at 508-823-0874.

Perched above a beautiful setting surrounded by water, palm trees and historic buildings, Ponce Inlet, Florida, offers travelers scenic views, science and more.      Inlet visitors can climb 175 feet, up 203 stairs, to reach a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean and the inlet at the Ponce De Leon Inlet Light Station. The complex features the lighthouse, Ponce Inlet Museum and the buildings once used by the U.S. Coast Guard.      The museum offers self-guided tours that take a deep look into the history of the lighthouse and light station. Learn about the men and their families who were the lighthouse keepers and took charge of lighting the paths for those at sea.   The lighthouse became automated in 1953. In 1970 the Coast Guard moved from the light station, leaving the historic structures vacant. A lot of damage was done by vandals -- however, citizens took it upon themselves to get the property deeded to the town of Ponce Inlet. The property was restored to a museum and the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places -- one of only a few light stations that had the buildings intact. It is now listed as a privately operated aid to navigation.      Guided group tours for 10 or more are available. For those wanting a different experience, sign up for the Climb to the Moon tour. The "old lighthouse keeper" will take history buffs on a trip to discover the history of the lighthouse. It takes place monthly on the eve of each full moon. Dates and times are listed at ponceinlet.org. The climb offers awesome moonlit views of the Atlantic Ocean, the world's most famous beach (Daytona), the inlet and inland waterways. Toast the full moon with a sparkling beverage as it rises over the water. Hors d'oeuvres are provided. Tickets may be purchased in advance by emailing admin@ponceinlet.org or calling 386-210-3660, ext. 10.      Or, take the two-hour Climb with the Keeper Tour. It is an intimate, informative time with the "old lighthouse keeper" to tour the museum when no other guests are present. It includes the entire lighthouse area and some that are normally closed to the general public. To jump in on this tour, email mwentzel@ponceinlet.org or call 386-210-3660, ext. 18.   Reservations are required for the special tours, and each costs $35 per person.      Tips for your visit:   • Climbers should be in good physical condition.   • Wear closed-toed shoes with non-slip soles and low heels. Flip-flops, sandals and high-heeled shoes are not recommended.   • Children must be able to climb the tower on their own.      Another climb awaits Ponce Inlet visitors at the observation tower at the Marine Science Center. The tower offers views of the estuary. Spend time with the turtles, eagles, owls and hawks, and feed the stingrays. A visit offers a great behind the scenes look into the rescue, rehabilitation and release of sick and injured turtles and birds. Visitors can observe the sea turtle patients and the operation of the hospital. It offers an opportunity to learn about the Florida marine ecosystems and animals that are indigenous to the area.      Touch a stingray and explore the nature trail; walk through the Mary Keller Bird Sanctuary, an area where the birds that no longer can live in the wild live a good life in Florida. During the Raptors Live program, visitors meet the birds of prey up close. Animal education programs are presented daily. Visit marinesciencecenter.com for times and pricing.

MCALESTER, Okla. (AP) — Police are investigating the slaying of a prominent local advocate for transgender rights who was shot and killed on New Year’s Day while driving a cab. Dustin Parker, 25, was found dead early Wednesday in the driver's seat of the cab he was driving in McAlester, Kevin Hearod, a police captain in the city about 105 miles (169 kilometers) southeast of Oklahoma City, told the McAlester News-Capital. Police are searching for a suspect or anyone with information about the killing, he said. The police department didn't immediately reply to phone messages seeking further information that were left Friday by The Associated Press. Investigators have not said whether they believe Parker’s gender identity had anything to do with why he was killed. Brian West, the owner of Rover Taxi in McAlester, told the AP that Parker got a call for a fare and arrived at the address on the city’s west side, where police later found Parker dead. West, a longtime friend, said Parker had a wife and four children, ages 2 to 13. Parker was well-known in the LGBTQ community and helped found a local chapter of Oklahomans for Equality in McAlester. According to the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign, Parker is the first transgender person killed in the U.S. in 2020.

Iran promised vengeance after a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad on Friday killed Qassem Soleimani, Tehrans most prominent military commander and the architect of its growing influence in the Middle East.Soleimani, a 62-year-old general who headed the elite Quds Force, was regarded as the second most powerful figure in Iran after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The overnight attack, authorized by President Donald Trump, was a dramatic escalation in a shadow war in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies, principally Israel and Saudi Arabia.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the strike aimed to disrupt an imminent attack that would have endangered Americans in the Middle East. Democratic critics said the Republican president had raised the risk of more violence in a dangerous region. Pompeo, in interviews on Fox News and CNN, declined to discuss many details of the alleged threat but said it was an intelligence- based assessment that drove the decision to target Soleimani.In a tweet, Trump said Soleimani had killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more, but did not elaborate. The attack also killed top Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al- Muhandis, an adviser to Soleimani.Their deaths divided Iraqi opinion. Many condemned the attacks, seeing Soleimani as a hero for his role in defeating Islamic State. Others voiced approval, saying Soleimani and Muhandis had backed the use of deadly force against unarmed anti-government protesters last year and put in place the militias they blame for many of Iraqs social and economic woes. However, many Iraqis criticised Washington for killing the men on Iraqi soil and possibly plunging the country into a war.The attack followed a sharp increase in U.S.-Iranian hostilities last week when pro-Iranian militiamen attacked the U.S. embassy in Iraq following a U.S. air raid on the Kataib Hezbollah militia, founded by Muhandis. Iraqs prime minister said with Fridays attack Washington had violated a deal for keeping U.S. troops in his country.CONCERN OVER ESCALATIONKhamenei said harsh revenge awaited the criminals who killed Soleimani and said his death would redouble resistance against the United States and Israel. He called for three days of national mourning and appointed Soleimanis deputy, Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani, to replace him as Quds Force head.Iran summoned a Swiss envoy for a second time to reply to a U.S. message, Iranian state media said, hours after a Swiss diplomat delivered Washingtons communication over the killing. U.S. officials said Soleimani was killed in a drone strike. Iran said he died in an attack by U.S. helicopters.Israel put its army on high alert and U.S. allies in Europe including Britain, France and Germany voiced concerns about an escalation in tensions. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad urged American citizens to leave Iraq immediately. Dozens of U.S. citizens working for foreign oil companies in the southern city of Basra were leaving the country. Iraqi officials said the evacuations would not affect output and exports.Oil prices jumped more than 3 a barrel over concern about disruption to Middle East supplies. In Beirut, the U.S. embassy urged Americans in Lebanon to be highly vigilant, a security alert on its website said.STICK OF DYNAMITE Trump critics called the operation reckless.President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox, said former Vice President Joe Biden, a contender in this years U.S. presidential election. Chas Freeman, a retired U.S. ambassador, said he could think of no other example of the United States openly killing a senior foreign government official during peacetime. In times of peace Never. This is unprecedented, Freeman said.As leader of the Quds Force, the foreign arm of the Revolutionary Guards, Soleimani had a key role in fighting in Syria and Iraq. Over two decades he was at the forefront of projecting the Islamic Republics military influence across the Middle East, acquiring celebrity status at home and abroad.President Hassan Rouhani said the assassination would stiffen Iranian resistance to the United States, while the Revolutionary Guards said anti-U.S. forces would exact revenge across the Muslim world. Hundreds of Iranians marched toward Khameneis compound in Tehran to convey their condolences.I am not a pro-regime person but I liked Soleimani. He was brave and he loved Iran, I am very sorry for our loss, said housewife Mina Khosrozadeh in Tehran. In Soleimanis home town, Kerman, people wearing black gathered in front of his fathers house, crying as they listened to a recitation of verses from the Koran.Heroes never die. It cannot be true. Qassem Soleimani will always be alive, said Mohammad Reza Seraj, a teacher. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said the killings breached Iraqs sovereignty and would lead to war.Israel has long seen Soleimani as a major threat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the U.S. action. Israeli Army Radio said the military was on heightened alert. Russia called the killing a short-sighted step that would lead to escalations in the region.PREVIOUS ATTACKSThe slain commanders Quds Force, along with paramilitary proxies from Lebanons Hezbollah to Iraqs Popular Mobilisation Forces grouping of Iranian-backed militias - battle-hardened militias armed with missiles - has ample means to respond.In September, U.S. officials blamed Iran for a missile and drone attack on oil plants of energy giant Saudi Aramco. Washington has also blamed Tehran for raids on Gulf shipping. Iran has denied responsibility for the strikes and accused Washington of warmongering by reimposing crippling sanctions on Irans main export, oil, in order to force Tehran to renegotiate a deal to freeze its nuclear activities.Soleimani had survived several assassination attempts by Western, Israeli and Arab agencies over the past two decades. The Quds Force, tasked with operating beyond Irans borders, shored up support for Syrias President Bashar al-Assad when he looked close to defeat in the civil war raging since 2011 and also helped militias defeat Islamic State in Iraq.Soleimani became head of the force in 1998, after which he quietly strengthened Irans ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syrias government and Shiite militia groups in Iraq.

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Friday the Senate should begin the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump even though it has not resolved a dispute over whether top White House aides will be called as witnesses. We should address mid-trial questions such as witnesses after briefs, opening arguments, senator questions and other relevant motions, McConnell said on the Senate floor as the chamber returned from a holiday break.The Senate is due to hold a trial to consider whether Trump should be removed from office, after the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives voted in December to impeach the president for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election. McConnell, a Republican, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer have been at loggerheads since late last year over how Trumps impeachment trial in the Senate should be conducted.

The stakes for states like Illinois to have accurate counts are high because the data gathered is tied to political power and federal money. Here’s what you need to know about the 2020 census:
 Why is the census being done?
 The U.S. Constitution mandates a count of the entire population to take place every decade. The process is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is part of the federal Department of Commerce. The data gathered from the decennial count is used to determine the number of representatives each state will have in Congress. It’s also used to redistrict political maps, and the amount each state gets from various federal funding programs is tied to its census-determined population.
 Counting everyone is of particular concern in Illinois, which has seen a population decline for the sixth year in a row and has lost more residents since 2010 than any other state. That’s accordingly to census population data that was gathered in between the big decennial counts and released Monday.
 When can I start filling out the census?
 April 1 marks Census Day, but the work to count the population will start much sooner.
 The U.S. Census Bureau will begin counting as soon as this month in remote parts of Alaska, and households across the country will start receiving mail by March 12 from the U.S. Census Bureau, giving them instructions on how to respond to the questionnaire.
 In Illinois, the mailings will come days just before the state’s March 17 primary election, so make sure they don’t get lost in campaign material that may be cluttering local mailboxes.
 From March 16 to March 24, the bureau will send a reminder about the census, said Ellisa Johnson, the Chicago deputy regional director for the U.S. Census Bureau. Another wave of mailings from the bureau will go out from March 26 to April 3 for households that still have not completed the questionnaire. Then on April 8 to April 16, the bureau will send out paper forms to households that by this point haven’t participated on their own, she said.
 What questions will the government ask?
 Each household — including people living together in apartments or mobile homes — will have to fill out a questionnaire that will include less than a dozen questions.
 The questionnaire, which can be completed online, by phone or in paper form by mail, will ask how many people are living in the household, what type of property it is and each resident’s name, gender, age on April 1, race and if the person is of Latino origin.
 If more than one person lives in the household, the bureau asks for a description of how each resident is related to the person filling out the form. For example, there are options for roommates, same-sex partners or siblings.
 The federal agency will not ask for a person’s Social Security number, bank account number, credit card number, immigration status or for donations.
 Will the 2020 census include a question about citizenship?
 The census questionnaire will not include a controversial inquiry about a person’s immigration or citizenship status. The U.S. Department of Commerce sought to include the question following a request from the U.S. Department of Justice. But the U.S. Supreme Court this summer blocked the question from appearing on the forms.
 Advocates, at the time were cautious about calling the ruling a victory. While the high court called the Trump administration’s reason for seeking to include the question “contrived,” the court did not definitively determine if residents could ever be asked in the future if they are citizens.
 Advocates encourage everyone, regardless of immigration status, to participate in the census.
 Will a census taker come to my house?
 If a household’s residents haven’t responded to the questionnaire on their own by April, census workers will start knocking on doors by May, according to the bureau. Before then, census workers will visit group living quarters such as college campuses and senior centers.

Wall Street fell from a record high on Friday after a U.S. air strike in Iraq ratcheted up tensions in the Middle East, while a bigger-than- expected contraction in the U.S. manufacturing sector again fanned fears of slowing economic growth.Demand for safe-haven assets soared as Iran vowed revenge for the killing of Qassem Soleimani, head of its elite Quds Force, in an air strike authorized by President Donald Trump. The banks sub-sector dropped about 1 as the news sent benchmark U.S. bond yields to their lowest since Dec. 12. Eight of the 11 SP 500 sectors were in the red, with only sectors considered defensive plays, such as real estate, trading higher.The sharp escalation in tensions related to the Middle East is certainly driving the trading narrative for U.S. stocks, said Peter Kenny, founder of Kennys Commentary LLC in New York. Does it mean continued escalation in tension and will it end up derailing the U.S. equity rally I dont think so, but its worth considering.The three main stock indexes had closed at record highs on Thursday, as fresh monetary stimulus by China added to investor optimism over trade. However, denting sentiment on Friday, data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in December by the most in more than a decade.At 1243 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 173.13 points, or 0.60, at 28,695.67, the SP 500 was down 14.10 points, or 0.43, at 3,243.75. The Nasdaq Composite was down 33.40 points, or 0.37, at 9,058.79. Safe-haven assets such as gold surged after the air strike, boosting shares of miners Newmont Goldcorp, Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp between 0.3 and 0.8.Weapons makers Lockheed Martin Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp were the biggest boost to the SP 500 index, gaining more than 4 after the air strike in Iraq. Meanwhile, oil prices jumped about 2, denting shares of American Airlines Group Inc and Southwest Airlines Co .Meanwhile, Tesla Inc shares hit a fresh record high after beating estimates for vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.50-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The SP index recorded 16 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 45 new highs and 10 new lows.

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday accused the BJP of misleading people by giving fake ownership papers to just 20 of the 40 lakh residents of unauthorized colonies. Sisodias reaction came after Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri handed over conveyance deeds and registry papers of houses to 20 residents of unauthorized colonies earlier in the day.I want to ask Union Minister Hardeep Puri, have you changed the land use Have you issued any notification Without making any provision, BJP has handed over fake documents to 20 people, Sisodia said. Pointing out that without regularisation, the BJP cannot accord permanent ownership to any home built on government or agricultural land, he claimed that the conveyance deeds distributed by Puri are worthless since there was no official notification on change of land use.You cannot give property rights or permanent ownership to a family, whose home is built on government or agricultural land, without first regularising these unauthorized colonies, the deputy CM said. Sisodia said while the Centre has now accepted that they are not regularising the unauthorized colonies, BJPs leaders continue to mislead people that they are regularising these colonies.BJP is misleading people by giving fake paper to 20 people out of 40 lakh people of unauthorized colonies. What will happen to 39,99,980 people Will their homes are regular or not he said. The deputy CM questioned the authenticity and validity of the registration papers provided by the BJP, pointing out that clause no 2 of their papers makes it clear that all existent laws will prevail and both the MCD and DDA have absolute authority to demolish any construction that is in contravention of the existing laws or master plan.Calling it a bluff of the BJP, Sisodia said the party has betrayed the trust and hopes of 40 lakh residents living in unauthorized colonies by distributing the fake papers. He further reinforced that BJP has not initiated any measure to regularise these unauthorized colonies despite their bombastic promises in Parliament and to the people of Delhi at public rallies and much-touted proclamations to the media.The BJPs claim that they are giving legal property and ownership rights to homes built on unauthorised land is fraudulent, he alleged.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said if re- elected in the upcoming Assembly polls, his government will make the Yamuna river so clean that residents of the national capital will be able to take a dip in it. Addressing his fourth townhall meeting in East Delhi, Kejriwal said cleaning the Yamuna will be the AAP governments priority in the next five years.Do you think we should clean Yamuna Kejriwal asked the audience which replied with a resounding yes. Cleaning up river Yamuna is our priority in the next five years. The river is polluted by sewer and industrial waste from the city. We have identified and planned a waste management system. I assure you that in the next five years, we will clean up the river Yamuna, the Chief Minister said.I can say this with complete confidence that within the next five years, Yamuna would be clean. Before next elections, you all would be able to take bath in Yamuna, and I will take a dip along with you then. We will clean Yamuna to that level. I hope we will hold a town hall session on the banks of river Yamuna, he added. He reiterated his promise to make bus rides free for students if he is re-elected. He had said this earlier in the second town hall meeting.Kejriwal said all the suggestions given by the people of Delhi will be included in his manifesto for the upcoming Delhi polls. A lot of work still has to be done in Delhi. Yamuna has to be cleaned, Delhi has to be cleaned, pollution needs to controlled and transport needs to be improved, he said.He also said the Delhi government, MCD and the LG are planning several steps to eradicate garbage dumps in Delhi. I hope that we will be able to resolve this issue in the next few years, along with cleaning roads, sewers, and river Yamuna. It is my dream to make Delhi the cleanest city in the world.Kejriwal said last-mile connectivity is important for the security of women in the city and the Delhi government has conducted a research study on the same and is working on it. We are very concerned about the safety and security of women in Delhi. The government, the police, and the society need to work on the issue on a war mission basis. We have installed CCTV cameras, deployed bus marshals, and are installing street lights across the city, he said.We have conducted a study on last mile connectivity in Delhi and will soon release the report on the same and work on resolving connectivity issues. The police need to strengthen their force and instill peoples faith in themselves, he said. On being asked whether he is confident about his win in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, Kejriwal said, AAP will win in Delhi.We are witnessing different voting patterns in the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections. Even though Odisha had assembly elections on the same day as the Lok Sabha elections, Naveen Patnaik was elected as the Chief Minister of Odisha by the people. We are witnessing the same trend across the country, he said.

 Thomas Patrick Michael O'Rourke USMC veteran and father of four, generous in gesture and spirit The world moves about a bit quieter today as the family of Thomas Patrick Michael O'Rourke would like you to know that Tom's work here is now done. Thomas lived a long, spirited life undoubtedly attributed to a spry sense of humor, blatant disregard for doctor's orders, liberal libations, generous portions of butter, and an earnest exuberance for daily life. Always an early riser and last to leave the party, Tommy burned the candle of this life at both ends - illuminating the lives of so many who knew and loved him. The youngest of six, Tom entered this world moments after his identical twin brother, John. Born to Lizzie and James O'Rourke of Glen Cove, N.Y., his dad owned O'Rourke's Restaurant. His mom was a talented seamstress. Tom proudly served in the Marine Corps. He built a career in aviation and commercial building maintenance that spanned over four decades. Understanding leadership is vested in service to others, he was instrumental in founding the Knights of Columbus in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. He served as grand knight. Thomas was the first to volunteer for most any task, whether it was emceeing a fundraiser, ushering at Mass, building radiator covers for the school, or helping a friend properly carve a turkey. Tommy was a national dart champion recognized in the New York Times, basketball coach, fisherman, and touted as the 'Roller Skating King of Glen Cove.' He excelled at repairing what was broken, growing tomato plants, outsmarting squirrels, rarely losing a game of pinochle, and watching The Quiet Man each time it was televised. In a world that tends to measure one's life by formal accomplishment, Tom's most valuable contributions were those hidden in the most unsuspecting of places. Tom never squandered an opportunity to hold a door open. He aided neighbors without fail. He had an eye open for souls struggling with groceries in parking lots. He cooked trays of sausage and peppers for the police just because 'they were brave.' A gifted storyteller, Tommy extracted lessons from failures. He believed in forgiveness, second chances, and unconditional love. He lived a life informed by faith in a merciful God. Tom maintained a twinkle in his eye even during times of sorrow, particularly when his wife, Patricia, died. He follows to eternal rest, his beloved parents; and his siblings, Robert, Mickey, John, and Elizabeth. He is survived by four daughters, Ann Marie, Mary Kate, Maureen, and Madeline. He is survived by his brother, Larry; two sons-in-law, Joseph Brasco and Alexander Kohn, and four granddaughters, Sonoma, Sienna, Scarlett, and Scout Brasco, and in-laws, nieces and nephews. Visitation will take place at Norman Dean Funeral Home, 16 Righter Ave. in Denville, N.J., on Sunday, Jan. 5, 2020 from 3 to 7 p.m. A Mass of Christian Burial will be offered on Monday, Jan. 6, 2020 at 10 a.m. at St. Mary's, 15 Myers Ave., Denville, N.J. Donations can be made to St Christopher Ottilie, 1 Alexander Place, Glen Cove, N.Y. 11542. The family asks in Tom's honor, do an unexpected act of kindness for another soul - hold open a door, share a joke, make someone a tray of food, sit with a friend, or just make someone smile.

Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinhos worst fears were realised when the club confirmed on Friday that striker Harry Kane suffered a torn hamstring during the defeat at Southampton. Kane, who has netted 27 goals for Spurs and England this season, was forced off late in the 1-0 loss on Wednesday after injuring his left hamstring scoring a disallowed goal.Mourinho said he believed the news would be bad when he addressed media ahead of Tottenhams FA Cup third-round clash at Middlesbrough on Sunday. The club later said Kane had indeed torn a hamstring -- an injury that usually means around one month on the sidelines.We can confirm that Harry Kane suffered a tear in his left hamstring during our New Years Day fixture against Southampton, a statement read. Our medical staff will continue to review the injury with treatment ongoing.Mourinho had earlier sounded gloomy about Kanes injury. If you ask me just my feeling -- good news or bad news -- I am more on bad news than good news, thats my feeling, Mourinho told reporters when asked about Kane.What the player felt, Harry Kane leaving a match, the way he did it, he didnt think twice, it didnt take him two seconds to realise the severity of the situation. I think were going to lose him for some period. Every minute of every game he doesnt play we miss him but I dont want to be crying all the time.Kane has been injury-free this season but had two lengthy lay-offs last season with ankle ligament injuries. Head up. Tough times dont last, tough people do, the 26-year-old said on Twitter.Another spell without Kane will be a major blow to Tottenham who are struggling to stay in the hunt for the top four having fallen six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. While Tottenham have been off the pace this season, England skipper Kane, twice the Premier Leagues Golden Boot winner, has been consistently finding the net.Everybody knows the importance of Harry in the squad. I think irreplaceable, Mourinho said. The good news for Mourinho is that forward Son Heung-min will be back from suspension for the trip to Middlesbrough after missing three games following a red card against Chelsea.Tottenham are also without Danny Rose calf, Ben Davies ankle and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris elbow while midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, who limped off against Southampton, is being assessed for a hip injury.

After the Munsee were forced off their land on the East Coast, the tribe settled in what is now Ohio, but they were forced to flee that area following the Gnadenhutten massacre in 1782, in which dozens of Native Americans were killed by militia members, according to a tribal history Hildebrandt provided the Journal-World. Different groups of Munsee joined with other tribes or moved to new locations, including Kansas.

During crunch time, it’s Brady or bust.
 All signs point to the Belichick-Brady Era coming to an end next week or, maybe, early February. The writing and the body language is on the wall.
 That’s OK. Twenty years is twice as long as most of these incredible coach- franchise QB relationships last.
 The Patriots’ defense is the strength of this team. At least it had been from opening day until the last few minutes of last Sunday.
 But the Patriots aren’t beating anybody, particularly with his disjointed running attack, without Brady doing something special at some point. Even if the Patriots slip past the Titans on Saturday night, the rest of the schedule would be against a Who’s Who of star quarterbacks.
 Brady was upbeat yesterday. He downplayed several questions referring to his “confidence,” which was no doubt shaken last Sunday afternoon.
 Belichick and Brady have been at this for a long time. We will probably find out in a few months about the rockier moments of their relationship.
 For now, though, beginning Saturday night, it would be nice to see Belichick and Brady on the same page.

Leicester City could wait until the end of the campaign to add to their squad and will look to retain the core of their team ahead of a potential return to European competition, manager Brendan Rodgers said on Friday. Leicester, Premier League winners in 2015-16, are second in the table behind runaway leaders Liverpool with 45 points from 21 games.Theres still improvement for our young players. Well put our focus on them. If we can bring someone in, great. If not, well wait until the summer, Rodgers told reporters before Saturdays FA Cup match against Wigan Athletic. Nobody will leave that we want to keep... if I didnt trust these players, I wouldnt put them in Premier League games. They have been first class in their attitude and quality.We know going into next season, if were in Europe, we need depth. January is a very difficult month to get the right types of player in. Well endeavour to. The squad is in a really good place. We dont want to stockpile. The leagues top scorer Jamie Vardy missed Wednesdays 3-0 league victory at Newcastle United with a calf problem.Hes coming along very well. Hes not available for the game on Saturday but hell be back training on Sunday, Rodgers said.
