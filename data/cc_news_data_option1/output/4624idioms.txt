Back in the ‘70s I used to sometimes watch a Sunday morning TV show called “Make a Wish.” A children’s program with songs, it was hosted by a genial musician named Tom Chapin. Little did I know he was the younger brother of an even more famous singer named Harry Chapin.
 If you’re old enough — or hip enough — you’ll remember some of Harry Chapin’s bittersweet stories in the form of songs.
 “Taxi” told about a cabbie encountering an old girlfriend as a passenger in his taxi, and realizing their lives had been disappointments. She wanted to be an actress and he wanted to learn to fly. Their relationship ended when she “took off to find the footlights” and he “took off to find the sky.” But here he was, hacking a taxi cab. And she had married wealthy sugar daddy.
 Asked if it was if the song was true, Chapin said, “It’s emotionally true, if not literally true.”
 He added, “I’ve been in the film business on and off for a lot of years, and wasn’t doing well at one point. So I went out and got a hack license for bread, and during the month that I was waiting for it to come through, I heard an old girlfriend of mine had gotten married and instead of becoming an actress she married a rich guy. I envisioned some night I’d be driving a cab in the big city streets and this lady would get in the back, and I’d turn and look at her and she’d look at me and know we both sold out our dreams.”
 WMEX DJ Jim Connors is credited with discovering Chapin and pushing his songs on the air.
 Connors was also the inspiration for another of Chapin’s popular stories-in-a- song, “W-O-L-D.” Here is the tale of an aging disc jockey who has given up his entire life and family for his career. Chapin wrote the song after overhearing Connors’ plaintive phone calls to his ex-wife while hanging out in the WMEX studio. The song became a Billboard Top 40 hit, a Top 10 in Canada and Top 10 in several other countries.
 This song appeared on Chapin’s third album, appropriately title “Short Stories.”
 Perhaps Harry Chapin’s most famous song was “Cat’s in the Cradle,” a cautionary tale about a father who doesn’t find time for his son and when the boy grows up — like father, like son — he doesn’t make time for his dad. A No. 1 hit, that one sold 2.5 million copies.
 You can follow Harry Chapin’s life and career in a new documentary called “Harry Chapin: When in Doubt, Do Something.”
 In this profile directed by first-timer Rick Korn, you will hear from Chapin’s family, band members and musical friends (Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Pat Benatar, Pete Seeger, Bob Geldof, Harry Belafonte and others) in a series of interviews, archive footage and photos.
 While the story of Harry Chapin’s life is certainly interesting, the real reason to see this film is to watch Chapin perform some of his classic songs.
 Harry Chapin led a charmed life, or so it seemed. Releasing one album a year, he earned an estimated $2 million per annum. He married a socialite named Sandra Gaston, a romance immortalized in his ballad, “I Want to Learn a Love Song.” They had two children (one singer Jen Chapin), and he also raised her three children from a previous marriage. Chapin devoted much of his time to social activism and was awarded a Congressional Medal of Honor for his efforts in combating hunger in the United States.
 Then — suddenly — he was dead, hit by a semi-trailer truck on the Long Island Expressway in 1981.
 At his death, he was supporting 17 relatives, 14 associations, seven foundations and 82 charities. Despite his success as a musician, he left little money and it became difficult to maintain these causes. As his wife explained, “Harry always said, ‘Money is for people,’ so he gave it away.” Thus, the Harry Chapin Foundation was established.
 During his career, Harry Chapin produced 11 studio albums. Another 17 appeared posthumously. One of these albums was titled “Songwriter.” Another was titled “Storyteller.”

The real alarm, along with the ensuing investigation and potentially serious forms of punishment, only goes off, however, when the person abused is a minor. This is tantamount to saying that the dozens and dozens of future priests who shared the bed with McCarrick, and hence to a great extent were condemned to an unbalanced priestly life to say the least, weren't really of major importance.

“Protecting ecosystems impacted by [the Lake Okeechobee Release Schedule] will also help sustain the regional economy dependent on tourism and property values,” he added.
 Lake discharges are sent west to the Caloosahatchee River and estuary that empties into the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the St. Lucie River and estuary that empties into the Atlantic Ocean.
 In 2000, Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, a $10.5 billion, a 35-year-plus project to restore central and south Florida water resources, including Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades, according to the court paperwork.
 These restoration projects, consisting of reservoirs, stormwater treatment areas, natural lands, flow-equalization basins, and other features, are intended to work in tandem to store, treat and convey treated water to where it is needed most, namely Everglades National Park and Florida Bay, instead of flushing it as untreated water into the estuaries.
 “We are pleased to hear that the Corps has been ordered to study and consider impacts of Lake Okeechobee releases and management on endangered wildlife,” said Keys resident and Florida Bay Forever director Emma Haydocy. “While the study area primarily covers the estuaries most directly impacted by the damaging releases on the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee, steps taken to manage the lake like a living system rather than simply a reservoir is beneficial for the greater Everglades and therefore Florida Bay.
 “Part of what we hope to see with the construction of the EAA Reservoir and other CERP projects aimed at storing, cleaning, and conveying water south to Everglades National Park and Florida Bay is the lessening of harmful discharges to the areas covered in this study,” added Haydocy. “It is critically important that the lake is managed holistically with the environment and wildlife in mind. That is, after all, what we are working so hard to restore.”
 While several CERP projects have already been implemented many more still await congressional funding, according to the Middlebrooks order.
 Meanwhile, pollutants from agriculture, industry and urban areas have tainted Everglades waters with phosphorus, nitrogen, and mercury.

Unless the government incentivizes new research and development efforts, superbugs may grow immune to our last remaining antibiotics. If that happens, even simple wounds could prove fatal. Procedures that risk infection — ranging from elective surgeries like joint replacements to lifesaving treatments like chemotherapy — could become too dangerous for doctors to perform.
 Rather than wait for superbugs to overwhelm our health system, we can take steps now to build an effective arsenal against them.
 For instance, lawmakers could offer tax breaks — like credits, allowances or deferrals — for antibiotics research and development spending, which would give companies a fighting chance to break even on their investments.
 They could also reform Medicare’s existing reimbursement structure, so that hospitals receive increased funding when they responsibly prescribe newer antibiotics. That would bolster demand for these advanced drugs and, in turn, make antibiotics research more attractive.
 Direct investment from government agencies like BARDA — the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority — would similarly incentivize antibiotics innovation.
 The government already helps fund some of this research, of course. BARDA’s CARB-X program establishes public-private partnerships that provide innovators with non-dilutive funding sources to propel antibiotic development.
 But current levels of investment aren’t sufficient. A world without effective antibiotics would make everyone worse off. It’d lead to widespread suffering and misery — and lop trillions off global GDP. Only by greatly boosting funding for research and development can we avert such a dystopian future.
 COVID caught us off guard. But Congress has the power to ensure we’re prepared for the next health crisis — one we know is coming.

Grocery stores are preparing for more shortages and two chains have already announced limits on buying some items.
 Kroger is allowing customers two each of paper towels, toilet paper, disinfecting wipes and hand soap. H-E-B is putting limits on those same things, along with rubbing alcohol, and first aid and cleaning gloves.
 A supply chain expert tells us the upcoming holidays and a recent surge in COVID-19 cases are adding to demand.
 Manufacturers are focusing on the most popular products, so less variety may also make it seem like there are more shortages.
 Months of steady demand has made it tough for retailers to stock up.
 “There hasn't been really a low season across the board to allow for building up inventory that we can use during the holiday season when we expect a surge in demand,” said Rafay Ishfaq, Associate Professor of Supply Chain Management at Auburn University.
 Another chain, Stew Leonard's, says it's ordering 20% more stock than usual before the holidays this year. Meanwhile, it's already seen an uptick in panic buying.
 Customers are looking for cleaning supplies, frozen foods and comfort foods.
 “I think there was a little unrest over the election and there still is, and people aren't really sure if there's going to be any type of a lockdown in America,” said Stew Leonard's CEO Stew Leonard Jr.
 In talking to customers, Stew Leonard's says it's found more people are preparing for small Thanksgiving gatherings. So, it's stocking up on smaller turkeys and offering recipes to people who are trying a hand at cooking one for the first time.
 By anticipating the changes, the chain hopes to keep shelves full through the end of the year.

KEY LARGO — Dylan Deese was sitting on his couch watching Ocean’s Eleven and eating chicken parmesan Sunday night when winds delivered by Tropical Storm Eta gusted up to 60 mph and a banyan tree with a 20-foot-wide root system crashed through his home, pinning him for a few minutes.
 “It was around 9:45 p.m. when I heard a creek and looked through the door and then the roof crashed in and fell on me,” Deese said Wednesday afternoon while trying to salvage a few basic belongings and rented cable equipment. “That’s when this tree kicked in my door like an angry ex. I didn’t get knocked out and I saw blood on my hands and I didn’t know where it was coming from, but I knew I was OK and able to move. It took me a minute to get out.”
 An injury to his head would require a trip to the hospital and stitches.
 When the rain-soaked ground and high winds laid the massive tree down, the 1-month-old metal roof buckled, the whole house shook, the bathroom sink fell off the wall and the tile flooring crumpled.
 Neighbors immediately came to help offering Deese shoes and a jacket. He escaped with just the clothes on his back, and shortly thereafter his dog, Aries, a 5-year-old chocolate Labrador, emerged uninjured.
 “She was sitting by the door right before it happened and luckily she moved under the kitchen island in time so the tree fell on the island and not her,” Deese said.
 With 14 staples in his head from the incident, Deese considers himself lucky to be alive.
 “I’m just trying to take it day by day," he said. "It’s not a huge deal. It’s all stuff that can be replaced.”
 Deese, who is a contractor for Bottoms and Props, a boat and yacht service company, is on the heels of recovering from COVID-19 and eager to get back to work.
 “2020 keeps on giving. I can’t work until I get these staples out at least,” he said. “Now with this, it will be about a month that I’ll be out of work.”
 Deese moved to the Florida Keys a few months after 2017's Hurricane Irma. This was his first tropical storm and it was just three months ago that he rented the home on Transylvania Avenue.
 “I finally found a place and just got it all set up the way I wanted it,” he said.
 For now, he’s staying with friends and hopes to be moved into a new place by next week, where he can bring his new bed, TV and Nintendo Switch that somehow remained intact.
 “Other than that, there’s not much left,” he said. “I’m just going to sit here and take it all in. I’m going to enjoy life every day.”
 Furniture, kitchenware and other home goods were a complete loss. Family and friends have taken to raising funds through "Dylan Hurricane Eta Relief" on gofundme.com and MarrVelous Pet Rescue has donated supplies to Aries.
 To contact Deese, email him at drdeese123@gmail.com.

The coronavirus pandemic initially clouded Luka Garza's decision whether to stay at Iowa or leave for the NBA. The uncertainty of the 2020-21 college basketball season and NBA draft made a tough choice even tougher.
   
 Once Garza decided to stay in Iowa City, he was all in. No doubts going forward.
   
 Garza was rewarded Wednesday by being the lone unanimous selection on The Associated Press preseason All-America team, one of many awards the talented big man has received prior to his senior season.
   
 "I couldn't be more excited about this year and coming back," Garza said. "Going through the process, I learned a lot, but at the end of the day, going through this team's potential, I felt like this was something I couldn't turn down and not be a part of."
   
 Garza was joined on the team by Illinois junior Ayo Dosunmu, Baylor senior Jared Butler, Oklahoma State freshman Cade Cunningham and seniors Corey Kispert of Gonzaga and Arizona State's Remy Martin, who tied for the final spot.
   
 Garza was one of college basketball's dominant players as a junior, averaging 23.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game while shooting 54% from the floor. The 6-foot-11 forward was a first-team AP All-American and finished second to Dayton's Obi Toppin in national player of the year voting.
   
 Iowa was ranked a program-high No. 5 in the AP preseason Top 25, in large part due to Garza's decision to return.
   
 "He might average a point or two less, but all that kid cares about is winning," Iowa coach Fran McCaffrey said. "He's put the time in. He's not rested on his accomplishments. He's hungrier than he's ever been. There's no better example for these young guys than Luka Garza."
   
 Same could be said for Butler.
   
 A 6-3 guard, he had a strong freshman season in 2018-19 and was even better as a sophomore, averaging 16.0 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game to earn third-team AP All-America honors.
   
 Baylor looked like a potential Final Four team a year ago before the pandemic canceled the season, and it could be in the mix again now that Butler is back after withdrawing from the NBA draft. The Bears were No. 2 in the AP preseason poll, highest in school history.
   
 "Jared has shown tremendous growth in his first two seasons at Baylor, both on and off the court," Baylor coach Scott Drew said. "He has always been a great teammate with an infectious personality and now that he's an upperclassman, he's taken on more of a leadership role."
   
 The dynamic Dosunmu also took a look at the NBA before deciding to return, a huge boost for the No. 8 Illini.
   
 The 6-5 guard was the first Illinois player in 20 years to lead the team in scoring as a freshman and sophomore. Dosunmu can do a little of everything on the court, averaging 16.6 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists while shooting 48% from the floor last season.
   
 Cunningham arrived in Stillwater with plenty of hype as the highest-rated recruit in school history. The athletic 6-8 guard can play the point or fill it up when he wants to, putting him at the top of numerous NBA draft boards for 2021.
   
 Cunningham dominated as a high schooler in Florida and is expected to have a similar impact in the Big 12 and beyond.
   
 Gonzaga was the AP preseason No. 1 for the first time and Kispert's decision to return was a big part of it.
   
 The 6-7 senior is a superb 3-point shooter (44% last season) and a good slasher to the basket. He averaged 13.9 points and 4.0 rebounds on a deep team last season and will be a key cog on a team with Final Four aspirations.
   
 Martin started his career at Arizona State has the bouncy-haired energizer off the bench, lifting his team with pizazz and hard-nosed defense. The 6-foot guard has since developed into an unquestioned leader on a team loaded with talented guards.
   
 Martin averaged 19.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists last season and his decision to bypass the NBA to stay for his senior season has expectations running high for the 18th-ranked Sun Devils.
   
 He is Arizona State's second preseason AP All-American, with Ike Diogu in 2003-04.

The European Union's deficit criterion corresponds to the debt criterion, according to which Member States are allowed to incur three percent of new debt annually on the basis of their economic output. The underlying calculation is as follows: with an (assumed) annual economic growth of five percent, three percent of new debt does not lead to a higher debt ratio in the long term. The 1990s are now more than two decades ago and with it the times of such high annual growth rates and average debt ratios of 60 percent.

The film feels too drawn out, however, during what amounts to its extended climactic sequence, in which she is invited to speak at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in 2019.
 Because she won't fly (Thunberg doesn't just talk the talk but walks the walk, griping about the lack of vegan options at a climate conference), the trip requires a harrowing ocean voyage to New York -- a journey presented in exhaustive and, indeed, exhausting detail.
 "I Am Greta" nevertheless stirs admiration for Thunberg's idealism, a passion that has transformed her from a shy kid into the leader of a youth movement.
 "Change is coming whether you like it or not," Thunberg says in one speech, expressing her attitude that when it comes to this particular fight, those in power must either lead or get out of the way.
 In the broadest strokes, the film succeeds in its primary objective, which is to draw attention to Thunberg's cause. It's in the execution where "I Am Greta" sometimes can't get out of its own way.
  _"I Am Greta" premieres Nov. 13 on Hulu._

Every school day Mrs. Winningham, as a part of math class, required each student to record their numbers from 1 through 100. The exercise involved writing a column of numbers down the left-hand side of the page from 1 to 10, then drawing a vertical line and recording 11 to 20, then 21 to 30, and so on until reaching 100. I found it to be a most useless and boring task. So I came up with a plan.
 I decided to take one of William Denney’s sheets of numbers from a previous day’s class, change the name and hand it in as mine, eliminating unnecessary labor. But to do so, I was faced with two challenges. The first challenge was the zeros (o). William Denney made zeros which were perfect circles. My zeros were oval in shape (like goose eggs.) So I had to change _all_ the zeros to avoid being caught. There were 10 of them. Secondly, I had to carefully erase William Denney’s name. Please understand. I was dealing with inch-high letters on soft, wide-lined paper. “William Denney” is a _long_ name. Erasing wide, lead-pencil lines is a delicate art. To avoid damaging the paper and removing all eraser dust required great skill. Each time I finished the job, I was very pleased with myself.
 My plan was executed with precision for weeks until the day Mrs. Winningham looked up from the work on her desk and declared in a voice which would put the fear of God in any six-year old, “Jack McCall, make me a new set of numbers!” I had been found out!
 In case I have a few readers who are disinclined to write down numbers (let me assure you, I understand), I apologize in advance.
 So here’s the deal. Take a sheet of paper. (A legal pad works really well.) On the left-hand side of the paper create a column of numbers, 1 through 25. [You will only have to deal with two zeros.] Then, list the 25 things for which you are most thankful. Don’t worry about the order of their most importance. Just let your mind free-flow. Relax and write down whatever comes to mind.
 On the next day, try it again. A “top ten” will begin to emerge as you review yesterday’s list. I once did this exercise for 30 consecutive days. You might want to try it. Here’s what you will learn: The things for which you are most grateful will naturally make their way to the top. But as you complete your list each day, new things will come to your attention. You will become more _aware._ You will began to _look_ for new things to add to your list. You will become more grateful for what you have.
 To get you started, here are a few of my favorites.

Read: The GOP’s demographic doom
 Republicans face their own riddles across both the Sun Belt and Rust Belt battlegrounds. It’s highly uncertain whether they can replicate their small- town and rural margins if Trump isn’t on the ballot—or reverse their suburban decline so long as he still defines the party. And especially in the Sun Belt states, the diverse, Democratic-leaning Millennials and Generation Z will continue to grow as a share of the electorate in the years ahead.
 The balance of power between the two sides is “precarious only if you assume” that the evolution of the party coalitions “stops at this point,” the veteran Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg told me. “The question is what happens as the country becomes more Millennial and Gen Z, who are diverse and express ... a great hostility to the Republicans and their agenda.” They’ll change “not just the national electorate, and not just California and New York,” he says, but also “Pennsylvania and Michigan and the other swing states.”

There's a new way to do contact tracing in the works and it could make a difference for health care providers during flu season.
 Vibrent Health just got a contract with major health institutions to develop the platform.
 Part of the idea is for users to enter their symptoms and find out if they're more likely to have the flu or COVID-19.
 “Health care facilities do get bombarded with perhaps people thinking that they have COVID when they just had flu, so the idea is how do you help the health care organizations to reduce some of the burden,” said Praduman Jain, founder and CEO of Vibrent Health.
 The technology is designed to be embedded in other apps that organizations and intuitions already use, like a university application for students.
 “So, make it easy for people and don't try to change their behavior,” said Jain. “They are already using certain applications that this can become a part of.”
 The app uses Wi-Fi networks to find out if you may have been close to someone with the virus.
 It could help cut some contact tracing work for public health departments. Instead of calling everyone that may have come in contact with the virus, the app can report that information.
 “There are only so many people, so many human beings, so many people that public health departments can hire to do that contact tracing, so technology becomes really important,” said Jain.
 Development is still in its early stages. Right now, the focus is on fine- tuning the algorithms to evolve along with changing data on the coronavirus.
 Broader testing is expected in the first few months of 2021.

People's attitude to this play of the features varies. In some civilizations the freedom of the face is largely restricted; it is thought improper to show pain and pleasure openly; a man shuts them away inside himself and his face remains calm. The real reason for this attitude is the desire for personal autonomy: no intrusion on oneself is permitted, nor does one intrude on anyone else. A man is supposed to have the strength to stand alone and also the strength to remain himself. The two things go hand in hand, for it is the influence of one man upon another which stimulates the unending succession of transformations. They are expressed in gestures and the movements of the face and, where these are suppressed, all transformation becomes difficult and, in the end, impossible.

There's nothing wrong with that to be certain, but it's not bound to work for everyone in the same manner since the world we currently live in is about as far away from being a utopia as it can be at this time since even those that are preaching unity and want to 'heal' the nation are still being pretty divisive. Listening to Abrams it's not hard to see that she has good motives and would likely cite Star Trek and its many upsides when stating that this is the model that society might need to follow in order to really break free of the current state we're in. But then there would be plenty that would gladly ask her just who would lead the charge when it comes to this new lifestyle, and who would foot the bill to make it happen. In short, it would be kind of a messy discussion that would no doubt lead to a big argument. But given the state of things following the election one might wonder if we're going to hear more about this in the years to come if only because leaning towards 'healing' the nation appears to be what a lot of people are trying to do.

CHAMPAIGN -- The recruiting Class of 2021 for Illinois basketball is still a work in progress, but the Illini are excited in early signee Luke Goode.
   
 Goode, a 6-foot-7 wing from Fort Wayne, Indiana, inked his National Letter of Intent on Wednesday, which marked the early signing date for basketball recruits. He was the No. 96 player in the Class of 2021 (via 247 Sports), and the No. 16 small forward in the country.
   
 Fourth-year Illinois coach Brad Underwood was excited to have Goode officially on board, and spoke glowingly of the future Illini hooper.
   
 "Luke Goode is a young man we've been eyeballing for quite some time," Underwood said. "We've been on him for a while, and it's nice to bring a piece that absolutely is a perfect fit for our university and for our basketball family."
   
 Known for being a proven sharpshooter who can hit from all areas on the court, Goode chose the Illini back in April over Michigan State, Butler, Maryland and others. He averaged 17.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game last season at Homestead High School, and he also played AAU ball with the Indy Heat.
   
 Illinois has long been after a sizable, potent wing player that can be a threat from the outside, while still possessing the physical frame and athleticism to compete against Big Ten Conference athletes.
   
 "He's a guy that has tremendous size, that was a priority for us in the recruiting process, a big wing who could really shoot it," Underwood said. "He's a guy that has tremendous versatility. He's not just a step in and shoot-and-catch (player), he can come off screens with great pace and be able to shoot the basketball over the top of people."
   
 Underwood also believes Goode will be a natural fit with the team and the culture that has been established after a resurgent 2019-20 season.
   
 "He's your typical gym rat," Underwood continued. "We call those guys everyday guys; he fits that perfectly."
   
 Goode is a promising prospect for Underwood and the Illini, especially because of Underwood's long desire to develop a truly effective wing.
   
 Alan Griffin showed flashes in two years at Illinois, but the 6-5 wing transferred to Syracuse after averaging 8.9 points and 4.5 rebounds per game as a sophomore, unable to crack the starting lineup as Underwood favored a guard-heavy approach.
   
 Tevian Jones, another player hoped to be an answer at wing, transferred to Southern Utah after a second season in which he struggled to make an impact on the floor. The 6-7 Arizona native showed potential at times, but was unable to find consistent playing time after struggling on the defensive end and with multiple suspensions.
   
 The Illini have added transfers Austin Hutcherson and Jacob Grandison -- two athletic, sizable options on the wing for this season, though Goode could be an even more talented player ultimately.
   
 Goode has been able to play some basketball on the AAU circuit during the pandemic, though his senior season at Homestead could still ultimately be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 He also was able to add some muscle over the summer after working with a personal trainer, something that was music to his future coach's ears.
   
 "Luke's been growing like crazy," Underwood said. "He's all of 6-7, but now he has been able to get in the weight room and have a full-time trainer there. We watched him through some video stuff in an event that he was at, and it's like, 'Oh, my goodness, his shoulders have all filled out all of a sudden.' It has been great for him to do that. It's a lot of just focusing purely on certain aspects of his game, and then his body as well."
   
 Goode, who is also a star quarterback on Homestead's football team, has also shown the willingness and adaptability to play multiple positions if needed. The Illini will want him on the wing, but he carried out the point guard duties for Homestead last season after an injury mandated it.
   
 There, he showed that he can create for others, while still being a big shooting threat on the perimeter.
   
 "He's so multidimensional," Underwood said. "He can play (point guard) because he handles the ball, he's an elite passer, no matter where you put him. It was a different role because he became maybe a little more of a facilitator than scorer when that role changed as point guard. He's a guy that attracts a lot of attention because of his ability to shoot the basketball, and to grow your game being able to play the point guard spot is going to do nothing but help him in his future plans as he moves to the collegiate level."
   
 While Goode was the only player Underwood and the Illini officially signed in the early period, they're still hot on the trail after standout prospects TyTy Washington and Mac Etienne, along with several other options.
   
 Washington, from Chandler, Arizona, is the No. 13 point guard and No. 67 overall recruit, according to 247. He's expected to make his commitment over the weekend, and Illinois is hoping for his commitment over Creighton.
   
 Mac Etienne, the No. 7 center in the Class of 2021 from Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, is considering the Illini as well, though a decision from him isn't expected until the early months of 2021.
   
 Underwood, for his part, acknowledged that his staff is still doing all it can to virtually land more targets.
   
 Illinois would certainly love to add a player of either Washington or Etienne's caliber, especially as it could lose talented players like Ayo Dosunmu and Kofi Cockburn to the NBA after the 2020-21 season.
   
 "Yeah, we're very active," Underwood said. "We'll see, this recruiting process has been very different than any we've seen, just simply because a lot of kids have not been on campus. Some are trying to wait that process out and go into the spring. I do know that there are some kids we've been on involved with for a few years that are going to go in the spring."

Read: A cold war between red and blue America
 The election’s outcome heralds a decade of grueling trench warfare between the two parties for control of the nation’s direction. While it also demonstrated clear problems for the GOP, the results already have Democratic strategists privately asking frank questions about whether any of the next generation of Democratic leaders, starting with Vice President–elect Kamala Harris, can sustain enough of the coalition that elected Biden to the White House without him on the ballot. Biden may be the last Democrat who can reliably hold those Rust Belt states as the party waits for demographic change and shifting suburban attitudes to bring the Sun Belt states more securely within their reach. At least in 2020, “it’s pretty clear that no other Democrat could have done what Biden did,” says Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor and representative from Illinois who once ran House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

 "[They] are seen to go over to a tree in the city centre and appear to stamp on the bricks in order to pick them up and put them in the bag to use as a weapon.
 "When the 17-year-old re-emerges he is looking at his bag. The Crown say this is the likely location where the defendant filled his bag with bricks or some other heavy object in advance of the attack."
