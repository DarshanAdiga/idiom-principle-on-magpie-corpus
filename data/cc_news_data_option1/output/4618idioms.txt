Extra fees cannot be collected from the students of educational institutions along with the monthly fees.   The Department of Secondary and Higher Education said instructions are being issued in this regard this week.   It is known that all the educational institutions in the country have been closed since March 17 due to the Corona pandemic. In such a situation, many parents have lost their jobs. Many have had their salaries reduced. Many businesses are severely affected. That is why they are struggling to pay their children's tuition fee. There has also been a movement in several educational institutions in the capital to reduce tuition fees.   Without considering such a situation, Educational Institute authorities are creating various pressures and collecting various fees from the parents along with tuition fees.   Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni has repeatedly urged the parents and authorities to be humane in this regard; the top educational institutions are not taking cognizance of it. For these reasons, it was decided to issue instructions to waive the additional fee.   Recently the Department of      Secondary and Higher Education fixed a guideline that is being prepared for the collection of tuition fees as the educational institution is closed. The students will be asked to collect only tuition fee by cancelling various fees including dua-mahfil fee, puja fee, festival fees, electricity, water bill, lab fee, sports fee along with monthly tuitions. For this, information has been collected from the top schools and colleges in the district headquarters of the country including Dhaka.   According to the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, instructions will be issued this week to identify various types of additional fees and cancel them.   Confirming the matter, Department of Secondary and Higher Education Director General Prof Syed Golam Faruk said, "Instructions regarding tuition fees will be issued in the next two-three days." On the basis of this, the educational authority will collect the tuition fees.   "We have collected information from various educational institutions in the country," he said.  It has been identified how much is being collected in any organisation. In light of this, additional fees will be deducted along with the institution-based tuition fee.

The public sector Cochin Shipyard sought to put paid to the pandemic blues by launching five vessels from its building dock in Kochi on Thursday. The day also saw keel being laid for two vessels.
 The vessels launched are two mini general cargo ships, each with a dead weight tonnage of 8000 tonnes, for JSW Shipping and Logistics Pvt Ltd, and three Floating Border Outpost Vessels (FBOP) for the Border Security Force (BSF). Meanwhile, keel laying was carried out for two more mini general cargo ships for JSW Shipping and Logistics.
 The shipyard achieved this milestone amidst the COVID-19 pandemic by working with available resources taking all necessary precautions, said a communication.
 The five vessels were launched by Rameetha K — Scientist ‘G’ at the Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory, a DRDO lab — who is spouse of the shipyard CMD, Madhu S. Nair. Mr Nair and Pranab K Jha, VP of JSW Shipping, conducted keel-laying of the two vessels. Senior shipyard officials were present on the occasion.
 The mini general cargo ships launched on Thursday are part of a series of four similar ships being built for the JSW group. These vessels are built and classed under the standards of Indian Register of Shipping and will be used for transportation of dry bulk cargo such as coal, iron ore, dolomite, and limestone. The vessels, with a length of 122 metre and height of 7.20 metre and speed of 10 knots, will have a compliment of 16 crew. These ships are expected to ply on the coastal route between Jaigarh Port and Dolvi Steel Plant in the river Amba near Dharamtar Port.
 The three FBOPs, with a length of 46 metre each, are part of a series of nine vessels being built for the Water Wing of the Border Security Force. These vessels are designed in-house by Cochin Shipyard and classed by Indian Register of Shipping. Each FBOP is designed with stowage arrangements for four fast patrol boats, which can be launched and hoisted using its own davit system. The vessels will act as a floating base for the flotilla of fast patrol boats and will supply petrol, fresh water and provisions to smaller boats and are meant for deployment on India’s eastern and western borders.

Barrett’s appointment represents the culmination of a years-long effort by Republicans to reshape the Supreme Court. Now, thanks to her nomination, the Supreme Court is expected to remain dominated by conservative justices for the next generation or two. What is even more chilling than the potential negative consequences of Barrett’s nomination for important social issues are the obstructionist circumstances led by Republicans that brought her to that seat. The ruthless tactics Republicans used up to this point to get to this nomination is truly infuriating.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has filed a case against Laxmipur-3 MP Mohammad Shahid Islam alias Kazi Papul, his wife MP Salina Islam and two other family members on   charges of money laundering and amassing illegal wealth.   ACC Deputy Director Md Salahuddin filed the case on Wednesday, said the anti- graft watchdog's spokesman Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya. The commission approved the case in a meeting on Tuesday. The case names Jasmine Prodhan, Shahid's sister-in-law, as the key suspect. The couple's daughter Wafa Islam has also been named in the case for abetting Shahid in his "illegal activities".   The couple is accused of amassing over Tk 23.1 million in illegal assets, according to the ACC case dossier.   The ACC said it also found an "illegal transaction and money laundering" worth Tk 1.48 billion in the account held by Jasmine.    "Jasmine formed an organisation named 'Leelabali' that exists on paper to help the couple validate their illegal wealth through money laundering," it added.   The commission found 44 accounts in different banks, including 34 accounts with NRB Commercial Bank, held by Jasmine, when Shahid was in a position of director.   The commission summoned and interrogated Salina Islam and her sister Jasmine on Jul 22.   After the interrogation, Salina insisted that they have no "illegally accumulated wealth". "We support the law and will provide all assistance to the ACC." Shahid has been arrested by authorities in Kuwait on charges of human trafficking and money laundering.

A male tiger crossing over from Maharashtra or Chhattisgarh forest regions is suspected to have killed the man Sidam Vignesh from Digada village of Dahegam mandal in Kumrambheem Asifabad district on Wednesday.
 A team from the Telangana State forest department which has inspected the site deep inside the forest where the body was spotted, found pugmarks of a male tiger. Postmortem report late in night too has confirmed death due to wild animal attack.
 The pug marks collected are being sent to the Forest Departments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, for comparison with their resident tigers, and verification if any of them is missing from there.
 Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Head of Forest Forces R. Sobha has categorically denied the reports that it was the doing of a homebred tiger K8 in Kagaznagar forest division. K8 is a female, moving afar in Penchikalpet area, while the pug marks were of a male tiger.
 “The tigers staying in Adilabad and Asifabad forests are of very calm nature. They only kill herbivore wild animals and cattle. They are not under any stress,” she said.
 While Maharashtra has several man-eating tigers, officials are yet to confirm the feline as one among them. A tiger can be declared man-eater only after repeated kills, they say. In the present case, it is not yet confirmed if the animal was stalking its victim before charging.
 “It could have been accidental too. The man was collecting leaves and seeing him in bent position, the tiger might have mistaken him to be another animal,” says an official under the condition of anonymity.
 On the other hand, if the beast was stalking him, the matter would assume utmost gravity. In any case, as the animal had consumed part of the body before being disturbed, efforts are on full swing to trap it. Cages with baits and camera traps are being deployed in order to capture it, and caution has been sounded in the surrounding villages about movement of the tiger. Forest staff and animal trackers have been placed round the clock in villages such as Kamargoan, Digada, Rampur, Shankarapur, Loha and Motlaguda, officials informed.

Brian Kelly is 6-0 against Boston College as Notre Dame's coach and is seeking his 100th career victory at the school. He'll be facing one of his former quarterbacks, Phil Jurkovec. The sophomore transfer completed 12 of 24 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns in a six-point loss at Clemson two weeks ago, leads the ACC with 2,083 passing yards, and is an adept scrambler who can throw effectively on the run.

LONDON, Nov 12 — Sterling traded weaker today after Britain’s economy grew by a slower than expected 1.1 per cent in September from August, a pace that leaves the country lagging other rich nations in its attempted recovery from the pandemic.
 The impact of the number was all the heavier because the period measured was before the latest Covid-19 restrictions on businesses took effect.
 Another piece of data released today showed that in the July-September period, gross domestic product grew by a record 15.5 per cent compared with the previous three months.
 Still, this number marginally missed expectations polled by Reuters as well, as economists were looking for 15.8 per cent growth in the third quarter.
 “The weaker than expected print will put the brakes on the recent sterling rally and will provide a reality check for the market and will highlight lingering headwinds for the pound in the form of ongoing Brexit negotiations and the growing economic impact of the pandemic,” said Sam Cooper, Vice President of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank.
 The United Kingdom reached a bleak milestone in its battle with coronavirus on Wednesday as the official death toll passed 50,000 casting a shadow on the positive news about the effectiveness of a potential vaccine, which was announced on Monday.
 British finance minister Rishi Sunak said steps taken to restrict the spread of Covid-19 had likely slowed economic growth since September.
 The pound was falling by 0.3 per cent against the US dollar and the euro, last trading at US$1.3191 (RM5.45) and 89.33 pence respectively.
 Traders in the British currency have been dealing with torrid times, as uncertainty and volatility in the pound grew on the back of rising coronavirus cases and the lack of clarity about whether Britain will exit the European Union customs union with a trade deal in hand in January.
 A EU-UK trade pact is unlikely to come together this week and negotiations might go into the next, an Irish minister said yesterday, confirming a Reuters report that the sides were now set to miss their mid-November deadline for a new Brexit deal.
 Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said today the entire world is watching Brexit negotiations, including US President-elect Joe Biden, who was looking forward for a Brexit trade deal to be clinched.
 Meanwhile, the top trade representatives for Brazil and the UK held a videoconference yesterday to discuss strengthening trade and investment links between the two countries, including a possible post-Brexit bilateral trade deal. — Reuters

The dynamic leaves Biden with little choice but to try to govern from the vanishing middle of a Washington that's been badly ruptured by the tumult of the last decade.

In my discussion with Segall, I argued that the Supreme Court might not be involved at all in the final decision. According to the Constitution, it's Congress, not the court, that decides which electors to accept. If, say, the Democratic governors of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, try to send a slate of Biden electors while their Republican legislatures send Trump electors, it will be up to Congress to decide which to accept. With the House controlled by Democrats, it seems unlikely Trump could prevail. But even getting to the point where Congress or the Supreme Court, or perhaps both, would be trying to decide which slate of electors to accept would take the country into an incredibly dark place. And it's not hard to imagine how it could turn violent.

SMITHVILLE — Smithville Kiwanis has been saving and planning for over a year to build a shelter at Helvey Park. Now, with sponsorship through family and veteran-owned LJ’s Handyman Service, Ron Major at Major Lumber, Byler Steel and the Swearingins with Quality Trust, in addition, to support from the city, ground is broken at the park and construction is underway for the Gene Littrell Memorial Shelter.
 “I know this is a project that has been in the works for a long time and we are happy to be able to break ground today,” David Cooper with Kiwanis said during a ground breaking Tuesday, Nov. 3. “This project came about way back when Kiwanis had a (concessions) trailer fund before I was part of that group. A few years ago we sold the trailer and put the money in the bank and wondered what to do with it.”
 Starla Janes, former president, said the shelter is being named for Gene Littrell who was a big community contributor, helped create the concessions trailer and was one of the founders of the Smithville Kiwanis Chapter.
 “He recently passed away this year,” Janes said.
 Janes added that the profit from the trailer didn’t pay for everything. They hope to continue to receive donations that will be put toward adding picnic tables, grills and hopefully a bathroom with water in the future.
 “This project cost $18,154.18,” Cooper added. “That’s just the shelter.”
 The structure will be pretty typical, Cooper continued. It will be 22 feet by 34 feet, open sided with a concrete flooring. The ceiling and roof will be made of steel and the posts will be cedar.
 Residents will be able to reserve the shelter through the city. The project is slated to be finished before the end of the year, depending on weather.
 “We wanted to make sure this park is more useful for the community,” Cooper said. “We also are really excited to use it with our annual fishing derby held in June by Kiwanis.”

And reporters Margaret Talev and Glen Johnson, in an article published in Axios on November 11, describe a frightening scenario in which Republicans in individual states could try to steal the election by refusing to honor the vote count.

A distanza di pochi giorni dal compleanno dell’ultracentenario Ferdinando Malfesi, oggi Orsara di Puglia farà gli auguri a un’altra persona che compirà il secolo di vita. Questa volta toccherà alla signora Carmela Zullo festeggiare i 100 anni di vita. Nata l’11 novembre del 1920, Carmela è una donna che ha lavorato tutta la vita. Ai sacrifici e all’impegno sul lavoro, ha aggiunto le fatiche, la sofferenza e le gioie che comportano la cura della famiglia. Terza di tre figli, Carmela è nata dal matrimonio tra suo padre Lorenzo Zullo e sua madre Felice Lalla. Fin da ragazzina, ha lavorato in campagna assieme ai componenti della sua famiglia d’origine. Nel 1938 arriva il suo matrimonio con Vito Di Biccari e Carmela inizia a lavorare come fornaia. Un mestiere durissimo che lei svolge fino al 1969, anche negli anni in cui diventa mamma e deve far crescere i suoi tre bambini: Biasina, Angelo e Peppino. Per tantissimo tempo, continua a curarsi dei propri figli e, contemporaneamente, a portare avanti il proprio lavoro. E continua a farlo anche dopo il 1969, anno in cui assieme al marito si trasferisce negli Stati Uniti. In America, dove assieme al marito lavora in una ditta di elettrodomestici, ci resta fino al 1980. Tornata a Orsara, ricomincia a lavorare come contadina fino all’età di 85 anni. Per oltre 20 anni e fino a qualche mese fa, ha continuato a curare e accudire il figlio Angelo che è morto lo scorso 18 febbraio dopo una lunga e grave malattia. Oggi Carmela vive da sola. E’ autonoma, in buona salute ed esce anche per raccogliere le verdure spontanee che ama cucinare. “L’ultima volta che sono andato a trovarla”, racconta il sindaco di Orsara di Puglia, Tommaso Lecce, “si trovava nei pressi di casa sua a raccogliere le erbe spontanee e commestibili che si trovano nel nostro territorio”. Carmela era bambina quando l’Italia visse gli anni difficili che seguirono alla “Grande guerra”. Quando scoppiò il secondo conflitto mondiale, invece, si era sposata da pochissimo. Ha visto susseguirsi al Quirinale tutti e 12 i presidenti della Repubblica eletti dal 1946 ad oggi. Quando la nazionale italiana di calcio vinse il suo primo Mondiale aveva 14 anni. Quando nacque la signora Carmela, Orsara di Puglia contava 7mila abitanti e, amministrativamente, era considerato un comune della provincia di Avellino. Nel 1969, quando la signora Carmela emigrò negli USA, il presidente degli Stati Uniti in carica era Richard Nixon. In America, dove restò fino al 1980, la signora Carmela vide esplodere le proteste pacifiste contro la sanguinosa guerra del Vietnam e riuscì ad assistere alle elezioni alla Casa Bianca prima di Gerald Ford poi di Jimmy Carter. Anche alla signora Carmela, l’Amministrazione comunale consegnerà una targa ricordo per renderle omaggio nel giorno del suo centesimo compleanno. “Carmela Zullo è una grande donna, umile, forte, coraggiosa, capace di andare oltreoceano in mezzo ai grattacieli e poi di tornare a Orsara a fare la contadina. Ha sempre lavorato ed è riuscita ad affrontare i problemi e i cambiamenti con volontà e spirito di adattamento. Le farò i miei auguri a nome di tutta la Comunità di Orsara di Puglia”.
