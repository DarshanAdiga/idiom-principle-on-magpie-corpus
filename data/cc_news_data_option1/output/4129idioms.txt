“I have no interest in going to Washington,” Cuomo said during an appearance on NBC’s Today show, adding: “I don’t want to go to Washington.”
 As for the Axios report, Cuomo, a divorced father of three who resides at the state-owned Governor’s Mansion in Albany, said, “I said I would serve as governor and those rumors — those are only from people who want to get me out of New York. I don’t know why, but that’s where that’s coming from.”
 Cuomo, in the event of a Biden victory next month, could still change his mind should a cabinet appointment be dangled before him, said veteran Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf.
 “Does Joe Biden need him?” Sheinkopf said. “Yes.”
 But he emphasized that with a significant financial crisis looming for both the state government and New York City in the coming year it would be unlikely for the governor to pull up stakes in New York.

Then Covid hit. We had trouble finding tenants because both international travel and the entertainment industry were impacted. We went from having a fully booked property to an empty one. So we started to think outside the box. We've always stayed away from short-term rentals because of the high turnover, so that was out of the question. My mother had the idea that we should do something to help hospitals. Then the idea clicked: If the laneway house would be sitting empty, why not offer it for free to nurses and doctors on the front lines?

The advisory requires individuals who have traveled to New York from areas with significant community spread to quarantine for 14 days.
 The full, updated travel advisory list of states and territories follows: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Guam, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Wyoming.
 In “red zone” focus areas included as part of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Cluster Action Initiative, the positivity rate for test results reported Monday was 4.13% — up from the 3.70% on Sunday. The red zone areas are home to 2.8% of state’s population, yet had 12.3% of all positive cases reported Sunday to the state.
 “Our numbers overall continue to remain steady, despite the micro-clusters that have popped up in certain pockets of the state,” Cuomo said in a press release Tuesday. “Our strategy is to continue to identify these clusters if and when they pop up, get even more refined in our targeting and attack them as needed.”
 The governor said that going into the fall, and as the numbers nationwide are rising, New Yorkers must wear their masks and socially distance.
 Within the red zone areas, there was a 4.13% positivity rate, Cuomo reported, while in the remainder of the state, not counting the red zones, there was a 1.2% positivity rate — the state’s overall positivity rate was 1.4%
 Of the 118 new hospital admissions Monday, 49 (or 42%) were from several counties — Brooklyn, Queens, Rockland, Orange and Broome — where the state is tracking recent cluster outbreaks.
 Cuomo said New York in June averaged 128 new admissions per day, 94 new admissions per day in July and 69 new daily admissions in August. The recent increase in daily hospital admissions has been primarily from the cluster areas the state is closely monitoring.
 New York’s peak of total COVID patients in the hospital at one time was 18,825 on April 12.
 Monday’s patient hospitalizations totaled 923 (+45), while there were 181 (-4) patients in ICUs, with 90 (+4) patients intubated.
 There were 11 deaths dues to COVID-19 on Monday, pushing the state’s confirmed total to 25,598.

William E. (Bill) Morrison of Davidson, NC, died on Saturday September 19 at age 94. He was the much-loved, respected, and doting father of William Emerson Morrison, Jr. of Charlotte and John Howell Morrison of Medford, MA. In addition to his sons, Bill is survived by grandchild Ezra James Montgomery Morrison, daughter-in-law Vivian Montgomery, both of Massachusetts, and daughter-in-law Wanda Morrison of Charlotte. He was preceded in death by his wife of 62 years, Emmy Howell Morrison and his five older siblings.Bill was born in 1926 on the Morrison's Cabarrus County dairy farm. The family traces their local roots to the mid 1700s. As a teenager during WWII he took on his three older brothers' farm work while they served in the military. Before marrying Emmy in 1952 and starting a family, Bill harvested trees on his farm, had them milled into lumber and used it to build their first home. Bill continued dairy farming into adulthood until beginning his career at Sealtest Dairy. There he moved into sales management for Kraft Foods and retired 35 years later having spent his life in all aspects of the dairy business. He singlehandedly transplanted many trees and moved large rocks while landscaping his portion of the original Morrison Farm and later his Davidson home. No excuse deterred him from accomplishing a task, especially any of Emmy's many gardening projects. Their Heritage Rose Garden gained regional acclaim, and the community admired the brick English herb garden he built for Emmys birthday. Even in his later years, he could be found on the roof fixing a gutter, or in a tree pruning a worrisome limb. Always busy, he nevertheless made time to ask the probing questions and ponder the larger life issues in a way that said, "I'm interested, I hear you."He was affectionately known to his family as the "Iron Man" because he never complained of being tired and originated the saying, "hard weather makes good wood."Bill continued making friends during the past two and one half years at The Laurels at Highland Creek. Bill had an unwavering lifetime commitment to the church. He served as a Deacon and an Elder for both Gilwood Presbyterian, his boyhood Church, and Davidson College Presbyterian Church where he was a member since 1964.Bill had a strong sense of what mattered - honesty, friendship, action, nurturing, positivity, devotion and restraint. Those who spent time with Bill never heard him say anything mean or disrespectful about anyone. His gentle, gregarious, genuine character won over all who knew him. It is a rare achievement indeed to leave the world with no enemies, but Bill made that look easy. Please make a generous donation to the cause of your choice in Bill's name. A memorial service will be held post Covid-19. Please contact Morrison.Memorial@rkdn.org to be notified of arrangements.

There was a rare cliffhanger as results came in from across the country for the five issues on the ballot. At the Dübendorf Air Force Center, a museum displaying former Swiss air force planes, TV cameras were cued up as rival campaigners braced for the public’s verdict on whether to spend CHF6 billion ($6.6 billion) on a new fleet of jets. But the initial numbers showed a 50-50 split and politicians’ prepared statements had to wait for several hours. Eventually the pro-jet side won a tiny majority: fewer than 9,000 votes out of more than three million ballots cast. Despite her side “winning”, Defence Minister Viola Amherd immediately conceded that a future purchase may be “cheaper than planned”, while the “losing” side that had been against the purchase announced plans for a new citizens’ initiative on the type of aircraft to be bought. In other words, the vote did not end the conversation.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett returns to Capitol Hill for a third day of confirmation hearings as senators dig deeper into the conservative judge’s outlook on abortion, health care and a potentially disputed presidential election — the Democrats running out of time to stop Republicans pushing her quick confirmation. Wednesday’s session is set to be Barrett’s last before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She has been batting away questions in long and lively exchanges, insisting she would bring no personal agenda to the court but decide cases “as they come.” Her nomination by President Donald Trump to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has ground other legislative business to a halt as Republicans excited by the prospect of locking in a 6-3 conservative court majority race to confirm her over Democratic objections before Election Day. “We’re going to fill this vacancy,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the committee chairman, said late Tuesday after a nearly 12-hour session.Graham said he appreciated that Trump had nominated a judge “who’s unabashedly pro-life, somebody who embraces their faith, but somebody who understands the difference between their personal views and judging.”Barrett’s nomination has been the focus at a Capitol mostly shut down by COVID-19 protocols, frustrating Democrats who are virtually powerless to stop a judge from confirmation. They warn she will be seated on the court in time to cast a vote to undo the Affordable Care Act next month, causing millions of Americans to lose coverage during a pandemic. “People are fed up,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., criticizing GOP priorities in forcing the Senate action as the country suffers from the pandemic and Congress squabbles over approving additional economic aid. The 48-year-old appellate court judge declared her conservative views in often colloquial language, but she refused many specifics Tuesday. She aligns with the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative mentor, and declined to say whether she would recuse herself from any election-related cases involving Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden.“Judges can’t just wake up one day and say I have an agenda — I like guns, I hate guns, I like abortion, I hate abortion — and walk in like a royal queen and impose their will on the world,” Barrett told the committee during its second day of hearings. “It’s not the law of Amy,” she said. “It’s the law of the American people.”Trump seemed pleased with her performance. “I think Amy’s doing incredibly well,” he said at the White House departing for a campaign rally.Trump has said he wants a justice seated for any disputes arising from his heated campaign against Biden, but Barrett testified she has not spoken to Trump or his team about election cases. Pressed by Democrats, she skipped past questions about ensuring the date of the election or preventing voter intimidation, both set in federal law, and the peaceful transfer of presidential power. She declined to commit to recusing herself from any post-election cases without first consulting the other justices.“I can’t offer an opinion on recusal without short-circuiting that entire process,” she said.A frustrated Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the panel, all but implored the nominee to be more specific about how she would handle landmark abortion cases, including Roe v. Wade and the follow-up Pennsylvania case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which confirmed it in large part.“It’s distressing not to get a good answer,” the U.S. senator from California told the judge.Barrett was unmoved. “I don’t have an agenda to try to overrule Casey,” she said. “I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come.” She later declined to characterize the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion as a “super-precedent” that must not be overturned.Democrats had no such reticence.“Let’s not make any mistake about it,” said California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, appearing remotely due to COVID concerns. Allowing Trump to fill the seat with Barrett “poses a threat to safe and legal abortion in our country,” Harris said.The Senate, led by Trump’s Republican allies, is pushing Barrett’s nomination to a quick vote before Nov. 3, and ahead of the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, which the Supreme Court is to hear a week after the election. Democrats warn that she would be a vote to undo the “Obamacare” law.“I’m not hostile to the ACA,” Barrett told the senators. The judge, accompanied by her family, described herself as taking a conservative, originalist approach to the Constitution. A former law professor, she told the senators that while she admires Scalia, she would bring her own approach. “You would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett,” she declared.Overall, Barrett’s conservative views are at odds with the late Ginsburg, a liberal icon. She would be Trump’s third justice.Underscoring the Republicans' confidence, Graham set an initial committee vote on the nomination for Thursday, the last day of hearings, which would allow final approval by the full Senate by the end of the month.Protesters rallied outside the Senate building, unable to come inside the hearing room.___Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Matthew Daly and Jessica Gresko in Washington, and Elana Schor in New York contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

HUNTINGTON — As the nation dives into flu season amid the pandemic, health officials say it’s more important than ever to take advantage of free COVID-19 testing.
 Don’t wait until you experience shortness of breath or a high fever before getting tested for COVID-19, cautions West Virginia State Health Officer Dr. Ayne Amjad.
 Local health departments are reporting finding positive COVID-19 patients who say their only symptoms were allergy-like, Amjad said last Wednesday during the governor’s press briefing.
 “It’s not just fever, cough, shortness of breath that people are reporting,” Amjad said. “We are also noticing people have symptoms such as allergies or body aches or general symptoms of just not feeling well. We encourage everyone out there, if they are having other symptoms like loss of taste or smell, or allergy symptoms that aren’t your normal, to get tested.”
 Amjad said testing will also help catch “super spreaders,” who often don’t have any symptoms but infect up to 75% of others.
 Though it is fall, allergies are still at play. Ragweed pollen is high in the Charleston area, according to The Weather Channel. Flu season is about to begin in force as well.
 COVID, flu, the common cold and allergies all have similar symptoms. Early in the pandemic, a person’s travel history helped determine if they had COVID, but now that it is prevalent in all communities, it’s tougher to tell the difference.
 “If you have any symptoms at all, please err on the side of caution and stay home and away from others,” a Lawrence County (Ohio) Health Department press release stated Thursday. “Consider having a COVID test. Fever is a good indicator of viral infections, but it’s not always a symptom. If you do have a fever, stay home until you are fever-free for 24 hours without use of a fever- reducing medicine. If you have other symptoms (sore throat, cough, runny nose or anything else), please stay home until symptoms are better.”

The total number of tests for detection of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has crossed nine crore in India, while the cumulative positivity rate is 8.04% and is on a continuous decline, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday."Very high countrywide testing on a sustained basis has also resulted in bringing down the national Covid-19 positivity rate. This indicates that the rate of spread of infection is being effectively contained. Twenty states and UTs have a positivity rate less than the national average. The cumulative positivity rate is 8.04 per cent and is on a continuous decline," the ministry said.India has been registering more new recoveries than the new cases consistently in the recent days.  As a result, the active cases are steadily declining and stand at 8,26,876 as on date and comprise only 11.42% of the total caseload of the country, the ministry highlighted.The health ministry said higher testing across wide regions leads to early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing, and timely and effective treatment in homes/facilities and in hospitals for the severe cases, adding that these measures in tandem eventually lead to lower mortality rate.A total of 74,632 Covid-19 cases have recovered and discharged in a span of 24 hours whereas 63,509 new infections were reported during the same period, according to Union health ministry dashboard. "Higher number of recoveries has aided the national Recovery Rate to further improve to 87.05%. The total recoveries have surged to 63,01,927 and exceed active cases of Covid-19 by 54,75,051.  Also, 79 per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs --- Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Delhi," the ministry said.Maharashtra continues to contribute the maximum with more than 15,000 single day recoveries.The ministry said that 77% of the 63,509 new infections registered in a span of 24 hours are from 10 states and UTs --Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnatala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.Kerala with 8,764 new cases has outnumbered Maharashtra (8,522) with the highest number of new reported cases.Top three contributing states, Kerala, Maharashtra and Karnataka, reported more than 8,000 cases followed by Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, both contributing more than 4,000 cases each.Also, 730 case Covid-19 fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours. Of these, nearly 80 per cent are concentrated in ten states and Union Territories."More than 25% of new fatalities reported are from Maharashtra (187 deaths).  India has demonstrated an exponential increase in the number of Covid-19 cumulative tests since January 2020.  The country's testing capacities have multiplied manifold with more than 1900 labs across the country and with collaborative efforts of the Centre and state and UT governments. More than 15 lakh samples can be tested every day," the ministry said.Progressive expansion in testing infrastructure has played a crucial role in the steep rise of testing numbers, it added.(With inputs from PTI)

Teays Physical Therapy Center, Inc. and The Putnam Herald are pleased to present this week’s male Gamer of the Week to junior Ismael Borrero of the Hurricane High School football team.
 Coming off a season where the Hurricane Redskins uncharacteristically finished with a 4-7 record, they arrived in 2020 with a hunger and desire to return to the top of the state rankings. Through the first 3 games, the Redskins sit at 2-1 with wins over Huntington and Parkersburg and a really tight loss to state power, Cabell Midland.
 The Redskins have been fielding a young group of players on both sides of the ball with many underclassmen. Junior quarterback Ismael Borrero has been one of the highlights for the squad as a first-year starter under center. In the early September victory over Huntington, Borrero worked out some kinks with an 8-15, 98 yards and 1 TD performance through the air to keep the Highlanders at bay 21-9.
 The Oct. 2 matchup with Parkersburg, however, is where Ismael really skyrocketed into the statewide spotlight. He led a lethal Redskins attack to the tune of 60 points in the 60-36 win. Borrero shined, completing 20 of 26 passes for 262 yards and 7 touchdowns.
 When asked about how the team handled the adjustment of being off for a full month between its first and second games due to COVD-19 limiting activities in Putnam County, Borrero noted that the team prepared each week as if it would be playing.
 “No one really knew what was going to happen week to week, so we just prepped and planned as if we would be playing and tried to stay locked in,” stated Borrero. Even last Friday going up against the then No. 5 team in the state in Cabell Midland, Hurricane had a positive outlook. As quoted in the Charleston Gazette, Coach Jeremy Taylor noted, “We knew they were a really good team, but you know what? We are good, too.” Borrero had another good game against a tough defense going 12 for 23 with 167 yards through the air and 2 TD’s, while adding a score with his feet as well.
 “Our goal is to make it to and win the state championship game,” said Borrero. “I think we have a good enough team to do it. We are pretty young, but our guys have stepped up and played really well so far.”

TIVERTON -- There have been 34 calls to police since June about a coyote sighting in the populated north end of town. Sometimes it's near Pocasset School, other times it's been seen in driveways and back yards of homes, near school bus stops, along the railroad tracks on Bay Street, and near the Bourne Mill apartments on Fish Road.
 It's been photographed numerous times and videoed during the day while munching on a chicken it just caught, and at night feasting on a deer on the side of the road that had apparently been hit by a car.
 Some callers have told police dispatchers that the coyote was stalking children or following them, that it went after their dog and ate a cat.
 While some people want it to be hunted and taken away, others on social media, where there are over 400 comments about the coyote, say it's just part of nature and should be left alone.
 Animal Control Officer Jennifer Stills tried to snare it recently, but it ran away carrying its lunch in its mouth, crossed Main Road and went into a wooded area.
 Police have responded to the dozens of calls over the last four-plus months. "Coyote ran off into the woods," is how most of the communications about the calls end.
 Stills said she does not know if there is just one coyote. A mail lady in the area told her she thinks there are three.
 Sightings have been reported on Bay Street, near the Bourne Mill at least a mile away, on State Avenue at the state line with Fall River, and as far south as Lepes Road, which is a couple of blocks south of Pocasset School.
 "The one I have seen and dealt with really just pays no mind to you," said Stills of the day she was called to a Main Road home where the coyote was eating a chicken on the front lawn while being videoed by a passerby. When Stills approached it with a snare pole, it ran, taking its lunch with it.
 Officers have been directed not to shoot it if they come into contact with it.
 "Officers are not authorized to euthanize any animal unless it presents an immediate danger/threat to another person or animal," Stills said in an internal memo to police officers after speaking about the situation with Chief Patrick Jones. "Officers are also required to obtain the permission of the officer-in-charge prior to use of any firearm to put down an animal."
 There was a report in late August of a coyote nipping a child in the behind at a party in Fall River, just over the state line with Tiverton. Stills said the coyote ran through the back yard and the child ran after it. She can also confirm that one dog was nipped by a coyote. She has not personally received reports of any cats gone missing.
 Stills said Massachusetts environmental officials have talked to Rhode Island environmental officials about the "common nuisance" coyote.
 It has been seen eating cat food at a home on the Fall River side of State Avenue where a shelter and a feeding area for stray cats has been set up by the homeowner.
 "There are easy meals for it everywhere, all over the north end," said Stills. "There's trash" the coyote can easily get into, "and people let their chickens loose."
 She said the situation is one of being "between a rock and a hard place."
 "I don't see any signs of aggression," Stills said of her encounters with the coyote. "It doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. I've had run-ins with it. It scares off easily," she said.
 Parents need to educate their children not to approach the coyote if they see it, she said, and report any threatening behavior to police.

 SOME English Football League clubs, including those where a number of Zimbabwean footballers ply their trade, will “disappear within five to six weeks” unless they get financial support, says Nigel Travis, chairman of League Two Leyton Orient.
 He also said ‘Project Big Picture’ – a plan by Liverpool and Manchester United to reform the English football pyramid – was a “great proposal”.
 The idea includes reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup.
 In return, the EFL would get 25 percent of all future TV deals plus a £250m bail-out.
 A number Zimbabwean footballers in the lower leagues of English football could find themselves in trouble, with their clubs either failing to pay them or going bust, amid concerns the game’s structure could collapse.

BOSTON -- There was a wild celebration that took place on June 8, 1986, starting late on that Sunday afternoon and carrying on for a few days.
 The Celtics had defeated the Houston Rockets, 114-97, in Game 6 of the NBA Finals for their third championship in six years and 16th in team history.
 It capped a sensational season with the Celtics (66-16) compiling the franchise's third-highest win total with a stunning 50-1 at Boston Garden, including the playoffs.
 And nine days later, the Celtics would get the No. 2 pick in the NBA Draft thanks to a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics involving Gerald Henderson, putting them in position to take Len Bias.
 As the celebration, complete with a parade and rally at City Hall Plaza, unfolded that week, the future was looking bright for the Celtics.
 They were back on top of the NBA, the 16 championships leading the second- place Los Angeles Lakers, who had nine, including five in Minneapolis and four on the West Coast.
 As the 1980s wound down, the Celtics and Lakers figured to at least match each other when it came to titles with leading characters such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish on one side and Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy on the other.
 But ever since the Celtics defeated the Rockets that Sunday afternoon, the head-to-head championship tally has been lopsided.
 In the last 34 years, the Lakers have won eight titles (1987, 1988, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2020) while the Celtics have just one (2008, when they defeated Los Angeles).
 So after holding that 16-9 edge in championship banners back in '86, the Celtics are now tied with the Lakers atop the NBA list with 17 titles apiece.
 It marks the first time since 1962, when the Celtics and Lakers each had five championships, that the Celtics are not in sole possession of the top spot.
 The Lakers made up that ground by finishing up the 1980s with back-to-back titles (defeating the Celtics in 1987 and the Detroit Pistons a year later), then putting together three in a row (2000-02) with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal leading the way.
 Bryant won two more without O'Neal, beating the Orlando Magic in 2009 and the Celtics the year after that, which brought the Lakers within 17-16 in the championship race.
 The signing of LeBron James in the summer of 2018 put the Lakers in position to even things up. Los Angeles failed to make the playoffs a year ago when James dealt with an injury, but after adding Anthony Davis for the 2019-20 season, the Lakers were one of the favorites.
 They delivered on Sunday night by finishing off the Miami Heat in six games, beating the Heat, 106-93, inside the bubble at Florida's Walt Disney World.
 After winning that title in '86, the Celtics got to the Finals just one more time in the Bird-McHale-Parish era, the bright future quickly fading away.
 Bias, the bridge to the future, died a day after the draft from a cocaine overdose.
 McHale and Bird dealt with injuries and Bill Walton, a key to their success in the 1985-86, played just 10 games the following season.
 The Celtics lost to the Lakers in the '87 Finals and didn't return until they acquired Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2007-08 season, defeating Los Angeles to end a 22-year title drought.
 The Celtics went through hard times in the 1990s after the departures of Bird, McHale and Parish, and the death of rising star Reggie Lewis from a heart ailment, and were below .500 six times that decade.
 So here are the Celtics and Lakers, tied at 17 titles, with the race on to break the tie.
 Which team has the best chance to getting banner No. 18 first?
 The morning after the Lakers clinched the 2020 title at Disney World, they are listed as the top choice to win another crown next season, whenever that might take place.
 The Celtics? Ranked fifth behind the Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, Milwaukee Bucks and Golden State Warriors.
 The Lakers have the inside track on getting that next title because of the one-two punch of James and Davis.
 James, who turns 36 in late December, is still a force with no sign that he will be slowing down any time soon. He remains in top physical shape and averaged 37.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists while playing 36.3 minutes in 21 playoff games.
 James has four championships with three different teams, and if he can get two more titles, he would be tied with Michael Jordan, giving him some help when it comes to the argument of who is the greatest player.
 The Lakers will have their leading players all back next season, but the Western Conference figures to be more challenging.
 The Clippers will have a new coach and incentive after blowing a 3-1 lead to the Denver Nuggets in the second round, spoiling an all-Los Angeles Western Conference finals possibility.
 The Warriors will have Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green back together after a lost season, and they will be adding the No. 2 pick from next month's draft, unless a trade for a proven veteran is made.
 As for the Celtics, they stumbled in the Eastern Conference finals against the Heat, kicking away 14- and 17-point leads in the opening two games and failing to recover. They wilted in the fourth quarter of Game 6 with a chance to force a deciding game.
 The Celtics have a solid core with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker plus Gordon Hayward and Marcus Smart. They need help at center, though, an area that hurt the Celtics against the Heat.
 And the Eastern Conference is going to be upgraded next season with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant together with the Brooklyn Nets, the Bucks looking to bounce back after a disappointing playoff showing and the Heat experienced after their long run.
 Will it be the Celtics or the Lakers first to reach the 18th NBA title?

CHARLESTON — Two men who grew up in Raleigh County sparred over each other’s tax records, job performances and what their plans are for the next four years in a West Virginia gubernatorial debate Tuesday night.
 From response to the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting teachers and school service personnel to civil rights and substance abuse, Gov. Jim Justice and Kanawha County Commissioner Ben Salango aimed to take the other candidate to task during the debate moderated by MetroNews’ Hoppy Kercheval at the media outlet’s studio in Morgantown.
 It was likely the only debate between the major party nominees for governor, as they have not agreed to any other debates with 21 days of voting left in the 2020 general election.
 Justice, a 69-year-old Republican coal magnate and owner of The Greenbrier, is seeking re-election as the Mountain State’s 36th governor after he was elected as a Democrat in 2016.
 The 2020 election is the first time Charleston attorney Salango, 47, a Democrat, is seeking election to state office.
 The other candidates for governor, Libertarian Erika Kolenich, the Mountain Party’s Daniel Lutz and independent write-in candidate Marshall Wilson, were not part of Tuesday’s debate.
 Kercheval moderated a debate that didn’t go off the rails, despite both men making pointed attacks on the others’ character, with Justice attempting to portray Salango as a wealthy, out-of-touch trial attorney, and Salango calling Justice a governor who has to get sued or have public employees strike in order to be motivated to pay his bills or show up to do his job.
 Early in the debate, Justice said Salango would be bad for business, pointing out that Salango has sued businesses in the state, earning millions of dollars in settlements and claims for his clients.
 “I’ve practiced law for 22 years,” Salango responded. “This governor has been sued over 800 times for not paying his bills. He has more courtroom experience than I do.”
 The issue of the COVID-19 pandemic led the debate. Kercheval asked Justice to respond to criticism about the color-coded school re-entry map.
 When it comes to handling the COVID-19 pandemic, Justice said he had listened to the experts when it came to developing a map and its metrics that determine whether public school students could attend classes in person and if student- athletes could participate in extracurricular activities. He also said West Virginia had received a high rating in how it had allocated $1.2 billion in CARES Act funds provided by Congress in June to respond to issues created by COVID-19.
 Salango said the state had received a pat on the back as to how it allocated the money, not on how it actually had spent the money. He pointed out that of $1.2 billion sent to the state in March, $1 billion of the money had not been spent. If elected, Salango would keep the state of emergency intact as well as the mask mandate, but he said he would not shut down the state, saying it would be devastating for the state’s economy.
 Salango grew up in Glen Morgan, just outside of Beckley, and graduated from Shady Spring High School before attending West Virginia University to earn his undergraduate and law degrees.
 Justice grew up in Beckley and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. He earned his undergraduate degree and master’s in business administration from Marshall University.
 Justice, frequently noted as being the only billionaire in West Virginia, has been criticized for not completely cutting ties with the day-to-day operations of his businesses, which includes coal, hospitality and agricultural businesses, by putting them in a blind trust. Justice on Tuesday even noted that he isn’t involved with his businesses, saying his children, James “Jay” Justice III and Dr. Jillean Justice, handle the family business operations.
 Salango also joined critics who have taken issue with the fact that the governor doesn’t work full time in Charleston, often commuting from his home in Lewisburg to the Capitol Complex in Charleston. Justice often is late for his thrice-weekly news conferences he’s hosted since the pandemic began.
 A lawsuit is pending before the West Virginia Supreme Court about the governor’s lack of residency in the Capital City. Supreme Court justices are set to hear arguments in the case against Justice at 10 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 14.
 Salango asked voters to consider this election as a job interview, saying he thought voters wouldn’t rehire Justice based on his job performance so far.
 “I wasn’t born wealthy. I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth,” Salango said. “We need somebody with energy, somebody who is going to bring new ideas, somebody who is going to move West Virginia forward, not somebody you have to sue just to get them to show up to work.”
 During the debate, Justice said Salango, as a Kanawha County commissioner, had cut the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department’s budget amid the pandemic, which Salango denied.
