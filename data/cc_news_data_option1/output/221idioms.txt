Seit Jahrzehnten haben Aktivist*innen das Agrarunternehmen auf dem Radar. 2018 exportierte Syngenta 37 Tonnen Profenophos nach Brasilien. Die Schweizer NGO Public Eye spricht von einem unmoralischen Geschaft: In der Schweiz ist das Insektizid namlich seit 2005 verboten. In Brasilien dagegen findet es breite Anwendung, um Seuchen in den Griff zu bekommen, die zum Beispiel Soja, Mais, Kaffee und Baumwolle befallen. Public Eye hat jetzt einen Bericht vorgelegt, in dem das Schweizer Parlament dazu aufgefordert wird, den giftigen Exporten ein Ende zu bereiten. Das Insektizid, das vor allem auf Baumwollfeldern zum Einsatz komme, sei extrem schadlich etwa fur Vogel und Bienen. Es handele sich um ein Nervengift, das Sarin ahnele. Auswirkungen auf die Entwicklung des Gehirns, vor allem bei Kindern, seien moglich, so Laurent Gaberell, bei Public Eye fur Landwirtschaft und Biodiversitat verantwortlich. In Brasilien seien Reste von Profenophos im Trinkwasser von Millionen Menschen gefunden worden.

Renato Stabile es un discreto integrante del equipo de defensa del exproductor de cine Harvey Weinstein. ¿Su trabajo? Examinar con lupa cada palabra, cada reacción de cientos de potenciales jurados para descartar a aquellos susceptibles de condenar por anticipado a su cliente.
 Sus nombres no aparecen en la prensa ni en documentos judiciales, su voz no se escucha en las audiencias. Pero los expertos en jurados, contratados tanto por la defensa como por la acusación, se han tornado cada vez más importantes en los grandes juicios civiles o penales en Estados Unidos.
 Su misión es escoger un jurado lo menos desfavorable posible para su cliente.
 El oficio fue creado por Jay Schulman a comienzos de los años 70, pero fue recién en 1995, durante el juicio de O.J. Simpson, cuando su importancia saltó a la luz.
 Contratada por la defensa, la experta en jurados Jo-Ellan Dimitrius tuvo una influencia decisiva en el caso, que terminó con la absolución del exjugador de fútbol americano pese a pruebas abrumadoras en su contra en el asesinato de su exesposa y un amigo de ésta.
 La selección de los jurados se lleva a cabo en varias etapas. Las personas convocadas son sometidas a cuestionarios escritos y/o orales, y luego la defensa y la acusación se ponen de acuerdo para escoger a 12 jurados y seis suplentes.
 El experto, que suele ser graduado en criminología o psicología, ayuda a redactar los cuestionarios y luego a analizar las respuestas.
 Pero antes investigan a los posibles jurados en las redes sociales, que se han convertido en una mina de oro.
 "El 90% de nuestras orientaciones en cuanto a los potenciales jurados se deciden antes de la audiencia", explicó Dimitrius a la AFP.
 El 10% restante depende del cuestionario, pero también "de su lenguaje corporal y de la manera en la que interactúan con los abogados", añadió.
 Hay que analizar las respuestas que dan, pero también lo que no dicen.
 "La sociedad y las opiniones políticas son tantas hoy en día que cada vez es más difícil" identificar a jurados imparciales, opinó Dimitrius. "Las personas esconden sus intenciones".
 "Hay personas que violuntariamente no responden una pregunta (...) o dan una media respuesta a una pregunta abierta", señaló por su lado Marshall Hennington, otro experto en jurados del bufete Hennington & Associates.
 \- ¿Corren los ricos con ventaja? -
 Para descartar a un jurado indeseable, hay dos posibilidades: la recusación motivada, cuando se le pide a un juez que deje de lado a una persona demostrando que no será objetiva, o la recusación determinante, que no requiere explicaciones pero que está limitada a 20 personas para defensa y otras tantas para la acusación.
 El jueves, la fiscal del juicio Weinstein, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, reprochó a la defensa descartar sistemáticamente a mujeres jóvenes en plena era #MeToo.
 "El 80% de la selección debe consistir en buscar y descartar a jurados desfavorables, y el resto a establecer una relación con el jurado e identificar a aquellos que nos serían desfavorables", explicó Mary Noffsinger, consultora de Courtroom Sciences Inc.
 También se busca a quien pueda ser líder y convencer a otros a miembros del jurado de su posición. Esta es una cualidad muy codiciada desde siempre pero incluso más actualmente, cuando los jóvenes "desean más formar parte de un grupo que quedar solos para defender la decisión que les parece justa", según Noffsinger.
 Antes del juicio, los expertos crean a veces grupos de discusión para tomar la temperatura al caso, e incluso organizan un falso proceso, con una selección de falsos jurados seleccionados en la zona donde luego se convocará a los verdaderos, para que sean representativos.
 "Aprendemos cosas sobre las fuerzas y las debilidades del caso, incluso elementos sobre el perfil del jurado", explicó Dimitrius.
 Los expertos también ayudan en la preparación de los testigos de la defensa y de los alegatos.
 La factura de un experto en jurados puede alcanzar las siete cifras, según Dimitrius.
 Por un solo día de selección de jurados se cobra hasta 10.000 dólares, explicó Noffsinger, que evalúa el costo de un falso proceso en unos 100.000 dólares.
 El consultor debe ayudar a su equipo a "transmitir un mensaje a los jurados y ayudar a que adhieran a nuestro punto de vista", dijo Hennington.
 Utilizados por los fiscales, pero sobre todo por clientes acomodados, ¿contribuyen los expertos a alimentar una justicia a medida de los ricos?
 "Si hay expertos en ambos lados y están a la altura, pienso que al final el jurado será tan justo como sea humanamente posible", estimó Dimitrius.

Every once in while someone we don’t know walks in to that coffee shop and we have a choice; do we ask the strangers who they are and how they are doing or what brings them to our neck of the woods?

Andrew Yang's wife details alleged sexual assault by doctor
 WASHINGTON (AP) — The wife of Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang says she was sexually assaulted by an obstetrician while she was pregnant with the couple's first child.
 Evelyn Yang said in an interview televised Thursday by CNN that the assault happened in 2012 and that she was initially afraid to tell anyone. She and 31 other women are now suing the doctor and the hospital system, saying they conspired and enabled the crimes.
 Yang said she was encouraged to speak out after seeing the positive reception she and her husband had been getting on the campaign trail by being open about their son's autism.
 "Something about being on the trail and meeting people and seeing the difference that we've been making already has moved me to share my own story about it, about sexual assault," she told CNN.
 Yang said she first began seeing Dr. Robert Hadden in New York in early 2012. As the months went on, Yang said, Hadden began asking her inappropriate questions about her sexual activity and spent more time conducting examinations.
 When she was seven months pregnant, Yang said, she believed her appointment was done and she was getting ready to leave when the doctor told her abruptly that he thought she might need a cesarean section. She said Hadden pulled her to him and undressed her, then used his fingers to examine her internally.
 "I knew it was wrong. I knew I was being assaulted," she said.
 But Yang said she "just kind of froze" and didn't react. "I remember trying to fix my eyes on a spot on the wall and just trying to avoid seeing his face as he was assaulting me, just waiting for it to be over," she told CNN.
 After the doctor left the room, she left the practice and didn't return.
 Hadden's lawyer has denied Yang's allegations in legal filings. His attorney declined a request to be interviewed by CNN.
 Yang said she initially didn't tell anyone what had happened to her. She said she blamed herself, thinking she must have done something to "invite this kind of behavior."
 Months later, after the couple's son was born, Yang got a letter in the mail saying Hadden had left the practice. Curious, she looked him up online and saw that another woman had made a police report accusing him of assaulting her.
 She said she realized then that she wasn't to blame for his actions.
 "This was a serial predator, and he just picked me as his prey," she told CNN.
 She said only then was she able to reveal the abuse to her husband.
 In a statement Thursday, Andrew Yang said he was "proud" of his wife and no one deserves to be treated as she was.
 "When victims of abuse come forward, they deserve our belief, support, and protection," Yang said. "I hope that Evelyn's story gives strength to those who have suffered and sends a clear message that our institutions must do more to protect and respond to women."
 He later tweeted, "I love my wife very very much."
 Evelyn Yang said several women came forward with similar stories about Hadden, and she learned the Manhattan district attorney's office had an open case against him.
 In 2016, she said, the DA's office agreed to a deal with Hadden in which he pleaded guilty to one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual assault. He also lost his medical license and had to register as the lowest level of sex offender.
 Yang said she felt betrayed by the plea deal, which allowed the doctor to avoid jail. The counts he pleaded to didn't involve her case, she said.
 Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement to CNN, "Because a conviction is never a guaranteed outcome in a criminal trial, our primary concern was holding him accountable and making sure he could never do this again -- which is why we insisted on a felony conviction and permanent surrender of his medical license."
 Yang and 31 other women are now suing Columbia University, where Hadden worked, along with its affiliates and the doctor itself, saying they "actively concealed, conspired, and enabled" Hadden's crimes, according to CNN.
 The lawsuit claims that medical assistants who worked with the doctor knew of the abuse but didn't intervene because of a power imbalance and lack of training, CNN said.
 Hadden has denied the additional allegations in court papers, CNN reported. Columbia University and the hospital system are fighting the lawsuit on procedural grounds, according to CNN.
 A university spokeswoman told CNN in response to a detailed list of questions that the accusations are "abhorrent" and they "deeply apologize to those whose trust was violated."

But remember, you’re not going to convince everyone about the good of agriculture. Even though farm tours and showing the behind the scenes worked for Harbstreet, it’s not going to work for everyone.
 “Because these are our long standing deeply held beliefs,” she said. “If you say some heritage or culture or the nostalgia factor that we have with food—you trace that back far enough, you’re gonna eventually end up on that far side of the spectrum.”
 Harbstreet said you have to find ways to “kind of drip this content out in an acceptable way that it makes it feel like an invitation to participate in the conversation.”
 “One of the ways that we can do that is to shift our thinking from an individual or a business entity into more of a personal brand,” she said.
 Consumers tend to ask friends and family their opinions on products and services in addition to reading online reviews when it comes to making purchasing decisions.
 “A direct conversation that’s taking place between consumers is just about as influential as any fact or figure that you can find or dig up on the internet,” Harbstreet said. “So by thinking of ourselves as more of a brand, we can kind of find the sweet spot in the middle.”
 Like Thompson-Weeman mentioned with the movable middle, Harbstreet said there’s still a lot of separation between the different groups within the middle section of consumers.
 “You guys are experts in your particular area,” she said. “Meanwhile, in kind of the digital space or through social media or these other groups, and they’re very influential, they may have either a huge audience or highly engaged audience, the ones that are really good at it, both.”
 Those are the folks forecasting the trends that are coming down the pipeline, and informing the general public about things that they should be keeping their finger on the pulse of.
 “One of the things that we can do to be more effective at telling our story is to learn how we can better overlap into other areas,” Harbstreet said. “Whether that’s getting involved in social media, whether it’s delegating that out to someone who’s a little more savvy. Not to say we have to be all things all at once either.”
 One could think they already have a “brand” when it comes to their business, but it goes beyond that.
 “I kind of compare it to your digital alter ego,” Harbstreet said. “You kind of have this persona that you put on a public space. Whether that’s online or in your community, but you can put on this hat when those tough conversations come up.”
 It’s not really a removal of your actual personality, but it becomes a lens that you work through when shaping these kinds of conversations.
 “For example, if you’re looking to be kind of that voice of reason and dispel some of those myths, that becomes the filter that you’re passing all of your responses through,” Harbstreet said. “It’s just kind of another layer into that, that picture of how it is you approach these conversations.”
 Online, Harbstreet has many recipes on social media, but in real life doesn’t get to do a lot of cooking any more.
 “But if you went online you’d never know that,” she said. “Alter ego kind of put on a persona that I present in order to initiate these conversations that I’ve started.”
 When a person sees himself or herself as a personal brand, it can be a great way to add value—whether working for yourself or someone else. For Harbstreet since she’s a “one woman shop” she relies on her voice to get her message out there instead of paying someone else to do it for her.
 “It’s a great way of marketing your services, depending on what it is that you do,” Harbstreet said.
 Agriculture might be a little different, but if a farm or ranch has different employees who are working off the farm or dabbling in other spaces, this personal brand could possibly become an advocate that widens the network and gets the story in front of more people.
 “Then if you are an employee, this is a great way to direct the conversation and kind of take ownership of it,” she said. “I think we’ve seen a lot of examples of how we tend to be more reactive than proactive, and seeing yourself as more of a personal brand, this is just one way to leverage that conversation and kind lead it in the direction you want to go without being so forceful about it.”

Ok Mike let me run this by you, and I’ll try to go slow since it’s you. Let’s say you have a job and you find out that your boss has offered your job to someone else while you are still working for that boss. That is exactly what happened to Troy Walters here. I can only imagine what he and the other assistants think. And if Mickey thinks about it (and I’m sure he has) he probably has deduced that if Frosty the Snowjob Man would do that to a top assistant he would do it to anybody. I realize it’s a cutthroat business but this is taking it to a new level. One more thing—where you played is your home. It may be your adopted home but it’s home. And as a former player there are benefits when you come back to coach. You are given more slack, just as Frosty the Snowjob Man got last year when he got the two year contract extension during a lackluster, embarrassing season. Joseph could have had this benefit too but he doesn’t want it. The word may be out in the coaching grapevine—-don’t work for this guy. Can’t trust him, hence my nickname for him.

In a corner of south Delhi, sitting on a main road for the fourth week in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the women of Shaheen Bagh remind me of Ammi, my mother-in-law.Ammi, who was from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, used to remind me of Mataji, my grandmother, who originally belonged to Lahore. One of them was a Muslim woman, the other a Hindu Punjabi. Both of them gave me a sense of secure belonging that has sustained me emotionally. I had known both of them only as elderly women and, to my eye, they looked remarkably alike. They had the same talents with embroidery, managing kitchens that served elaborate feasts regularly, and intuiting the needs of others. They were creative and strategic. They governed their worlds quietly from the background and knew when a crisis needed them to cross invisible boundaries and step into the foreground.This is what the thousands of protesting women in Shaheen Bagh seem to have done. They have emerged into the public space to collectively confront a looming crisis. Most of them are first-time protesters. Some of them are students, some are matriarchs. There are young women with small children in their laps. There are great-grandmothers. There are artists and organizers, poets and singers. Sometimes they are angry, other times they laugh with abandon. They take time off to pray, to go home and keep the kitchens functional. They return with determination. They know what the CAA-NPR-NRC (a new citizenship law, a population register, and a proposed one of citizens) is about and videos of them explaining why it is wrong are viral on social and mainstream media.The nature of the unfolding confrontation between the people of India and its government over the CAA-NPR-NRC is so new and so vast that I struggle for words that can help me understand what is going on. There is an unprecedented solidarity being displayed in the daily rallies that draw out hundreds of people all over Indian towns. There are no visible leaders calling out to people to protest in one mode or another. Yet the country has found a way to speak truth to power.There is also a new and brazen violence that has been unleashed—most visible in the police assaults on protesters in various districts of Uttar Pradesh and attacks on students of Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University and Jawaharlal Nehru University.On a fact-finding visit to Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, I met a man who reminded me so much of my grandfather that it made my heart ache. The same brown complexion, gruff voice and familiar grey winter coat. Haji Hamid Hasan has been a well-to-do timber businessman and his home was attacked by police personnel who destroyed the interiors ruthlessly. His 14-year-old grandson had been beaten and detained and his son was still in prison when I met him with a team. His granddaughter lay in bed with head injuries while the rest of the family spoke in low voices as they recounted the violence they had endured.The elderly man walked out of his home along with us and addressed two shopkeepers who have been his tenants for almost two decades. “Am I a bad man?” he asked loudly. “Tell them what a bad person I am, tell them how I have treated you all these years....”And then he broke down. As I watched him cry, I wanted to hold him and address him as Dadaji. There were others with me who consoled him. The shopkeepers recounted how generous Haji Hasan had always been. “When someone is unwell in our home, he comes all the way to ask about how we are doing. He really takes care of us. We have never felt like we are different because we are Hindus and he is Muslim,” one of them said.We will repair what is broken, I resolve to myself at moments such as this, mostly to address the panic that begins to rise within me. The world has lived through crises before. Humans have been cruel to each other before and yet we have managed to restore peace. I try not to think of conflict zones that have never recovered. We will not be one of them. I was born in a peaceful India, I must participate in protecting and restoring it.In conversations within circles of journalists, activists and otherwise concerned citizens, people wonder about the phenomenon of the protesting Muslim women in Shaheen Bagh, the students of Jamia and other places all over the country. Will the state respond with violence one day and force them to evict? Is this movement sustainable? What is its impact?We don’t have a road map, we must learn to imagine anew.Saida Sultana, my sister-in- law, calls me from Lucknow to get updates on the news. She has been to the home of the Muslim rickshaw-puller who was shot and killed on the first day of the protests in her city. She found out that his wife was a Hindu. The mother and the wife of the victim are sharing the financial help they are receiving.“Can you tell them to not target students,” Saida Aapa says rhetorically, days after the students of JNU have been attacked by armed mobs. “Just leave the children alone.”Unexpectedly, my mother also discusses the anti-CAA protests with me. She is visibly angry about the divisive nature of the Act. Something has touched people at their core, and many of those who have been quiet before are finding their voice.At protest sites, the numbers continue to grow, drawing newer groups of people—both in curiosity and with a feeling of fraternity. The more we confront the grief of others, the more we find that our ability to connect with each other expands. We are surprised by the rush of energy that solidarity brings.There is no doubt that we are living in extraordinary times—the kind of moment when the best of humanity is pitted against the worst we are capable of. This is not a time to rest. It is a time to soak in the inspiration, to allow oneself to be led, to find one’s voice and use it to empower the collective.Natasha Badhwar is a film-maker and the author of My Daughters’ Mum and Immortal For A Moment.Twitter - @natashabadhwar

On a fact-finding visit to Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, I met a man who reminded me so much of my grandfather that it made my heart ache. The same brown complexion, gruff voice and familiar grey winter coat. Haji Hamid Hasan has been a well-to-do timber businessman and his home was attacked by police personnel who destroyed the interiors ruthlessly. His 14-year-old grandson had been beaten and detained and his son was still in prison when I met him with a team. His granddaughter lay in bed with head injuries while the rest of the family spoke in low voices as they recounted the violence they had endured.

_Nessuno della gerarchia politica del Comune di Ravenna ha informato nessuno, neppure la commissione consiliare Ambiente e Diritti degli animali presieduta dal sottoscritto, che il capo del servizio Ambiente di questo Comune, Gianni Gregorio, se ne sta andando da Ravenna a Bologna, presso la Regione Emilia- Romagna, dove capegger a il servizio delle Aree protette (parchi, riserve naturali, aree di riequilibrio ecologico, paesaggi naturali e seminaturali protetti, nonche i siti della Rete Natura 2000) e delle Foreste. Di questo patrimonio ambientale, che copre il 16% del territorio regionale, il nostro Comune, tra pinete, valli, pialasse, ecc., e sicuramente il piu dotato, anche se il piu maltrattato dalla Regione, come ha dimostrato l'epidemia che tra settembre e ottobre scorsi ha fatto strage di uccelli nella valle della Canna. Risale proprio ad ottobre 2019 l'esito dell'avviso pubblico di mobilita esterna per passaggio diretto tra pubbliche amministrazioni, emesso dalla Regione per coprire il posto di cui sopra, resosi vacante dopo il pensionamento dell'ing. Enzo Valbonesi. Nella graduatoria, risultante dal colloquio svolto con un'apposita commissione, Gregorio ha prevalso sull'altro concorrente valutato idoneo per 25 punti a 22. La mobilita dei dirigenti entro la pubblica amministrazione non e soggetta ad alcuna autorizzazione dell'ente di derivazione. È dunque certo che Gregorio, con la tempistica che probabilmente vorra concordare col sindaco, lascera l'amministrazione comunale di Ravenna. Da un lato, possiamo auspicare che, grazie alla  nuova autorevole posizione a cui e destinato, la Regione guardi con occhio piu attento e tratti per come necessita il malandato patrimonio naturale e ambientale della nostra citta, allargando doverosamente il cordone della borsa. Dall'altro, la sua partenza apre pero un vuoto che appare incolmabile senza un vero concorso pubblico, di non rapida attuazione._ _La situazione si presenta particolarmente grave constatando, come Lista per Ravenna denuncia ripetutamente da tempo, che il servizio Ambiente soffre una carenza di personale che non ha pari nell 'amministrazione comunale. Basti dire che la sua dotazione organica e totalmente priva dei cosiddetti "quadri amministrativi", presenti negli altri servizi nel numero di 49, in grado, quasi come vice dirigenti, di rivestire posizioni autonome di responsabilita. Da solo, il dirigente dell'Ambiente si deve dunque occupare direttamente di una serie di strutture operative da far tremare i polsi, quali la Tutela dell'Ambiente, le Zone naturali, la Protezione civile, il Verde pubblico, il settore Geologico, il Benessere degli Animali, l'Educazione ambientale. Oltretutto e scarso anche il personale dipendente. Si pensi che, di fronte alla serie vastissima di controlli che dovrebbero essere effettuati sulla gestione di tutte queste attivita, il servizio dispone di soli quattro agenti di polizia. Per giunta, il Comune di Ravenna, a seguito di un accordo stipulato col Parco del Delta del Po, deve occuparsi di tutte le zone naturali di competenza di questo ente, tra cui in primis la Valle della Canna e Punte Alberete._ _ È dunque importante chiedere al sindaco come intende sopperire adeguatamente alle prossime dimissioni del dr Gianni Gregorio da capo del servizio Ambiente e se, con l'occasione, vorra proporsi di potenziare strutturalmente, in misura adeguata, la dotazione organica del personale addetto a tale servizio._

Wow a former Husker turns down an opportunity to come home. And that job offer had a pretty spiffy title attached to it as well. I guess Lincoln may not be the elite coaching destination it used to be. But let’s not be confused here. This has nothing to do with coaching and everything to do with recruiting. Walters has not been an effective recruiter and Joseph has. But the sales pitch from Frosty the Snowjob Man could not get Mickey to accept the job. No doubt that LSU bumped up his pay to keep him on board, but NU has plenty of cash too. I don’t know why he stayed put but it doesn’t reflect well on Frosty the Snowjob Man.

We knew we had to build this up and get back here, but we knew how good of an organization it was, and when you do have a good organization, usually those tough times don't last. If you can just stay the course and be a little bit patient."
