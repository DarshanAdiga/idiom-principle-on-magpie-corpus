It’s been quite the offseason for the Eclipse franchise. Ryerse and co-owners Scott Brown (majority owner) and Patrick Cannon purchased the Philadelphia Revolution junior franchise and were set to relocate to Keene, New Hampshire. That plan ended when they couldn’t come to terms with the city of Keene to use the city-owned Keene Community Ice Rink. With the Maine Wild of the NA3HL — another Tier III junior league under USA Hockey — not operating at Biddeford Ice Arena this year, the Eclipse had the home they needed.

"This song is one of my all-time favourite psychedelic rock tracks. It without question takes you on a journey every time you listen to it, with amazingly interesting shifts throughout the track. I fell in love with this song even further when I saw the "Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii" video showing the band in the ruins, rolling around in the dirt playing these immensely forward-thinking songs. I think still to this day it influences listeners to dig deeper into their musical experiences."

 ARTHUR--Patriotism is overflowing in this village.
 Since 1942, Arthur -- 40 kilometres north of Guelph on Highway 6 -- has worn the title of Canada's most patriotic village.
 That's when the Toronto Star reported Arthur had contributed the highest percentage in Canada of its local citizens to fight in the war. With a population of 836, it had 116 citizens in uniform overseas.
 It also had the highest spending per capita in Canada for buying war bonds to help Ottawa finance the war effort.
 When old soldiers, sailors and airmen die, their families often wonder what to do with their relative's military uniform, medals and other paraphernalia.
 For many, it means shipping them off to Arthur.
 Today, one of Arthur's Second World War vets -- 94-year-old John Walsh -- operates a museum that records and salutes the wartime contributions of the people from the area.
 The museum is a division of the Arthur and Area Historical Society.
 The village sits in the midst of Ontario's finest agricultural lands. On Saturdays, it hosts an excellent farmers market. Unfortunately, the museum is open only on Wednesday afternoons from 1 to 3.
 There are Canadian flags and banners hanging throughout the village on homes and businesses.
 Walsh, a retired pharmacist, survived the Battle of the Atlantic as a sailor on HMCS Wallaceburg, a minesweeper that escorted convoys of supply ships across the Atlantic.
 The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest battle of the entire war, lasting from 1939 to 1945. More than 3,500 supply ships were sunk, plus 175 Allied warships. The Germans lost 783 U-boats, plus 47 surface raiders like the battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz.
 The Wallaceburg survived the war, was used for several years as a training vessel for reservists and was then sold to Belgium in 1959 as a coastal patrol vessel. It stayed in service for 10 years before being scrapped.
 Walsh graduated from the University of Toronto and operated a successful pharmacy in Arthur, which is now in the hands of one of his five sons. He also has three daughters.
 You can still see Walsh's warship. It's depicted at sea on a huge wall mural on the Frederick Street wall of Sussman's clothing store. Sussman's is one of the largest and most popular men's clothing stores in southwestern Ontario. The store, which is more than 100 years old, fronts onto Highway 6, which is also Arthur's main street.
 The military museum is directly across the street. Walsh operates it in Arthur's chamber of commerce building, but has run out of room to display all the artifacts veterans and their families have sent him -- mostly from the Arthur area, but also from around Ontario and across Canada. There's plenty more in storage off-site.
 Among the most emotional documents are letters sent home to moms by their boys overseas. Those letters were read and recorded by former CBC researcher Gail Donald, who grew up in nearby Kenilworth, worked 40 years in Toronto and retired to Arthur to help Walsh catalogue his thousands of artifacts.
 She said many of the letters and diaries read like young men enjoying fun times in Britain and away from the front lines, but many of them ended with a notation like "we're back in the air tomorrow morning for a bombing run over Germany" … as the last entry.
 By the war's end, 338 Arthur residents were enlisted, with 25 killed in action.
 Their names are carved into a large cenotaph just a couple doors farther up main street from the historical society. It was built using field stones gathered on the farms where many of Arthur's warriors grew up. The cost of construction and buying the land was covered by local women, mostly the mothers, wives, sisters and girlfriends of those who went overseas.
 In spring, the cenotaph is awash with red tulips sent from the Netherlands to thank Arthur for sending its men to help liberate the country from Nazi occupation
 The museum also salutes a younger generation of Arthur veterans who recently served in the Canadian Armed Forces, like Capt. Debbie (Mullin) Hynes.
 She was a flight nurse with the RCAF, who served in Afghanistan and in Rwanda.
 She is now a civilian who was teaching field nursing to cadets at the Royal Military College in Kingston until COVID-19 erupted.
 Sgt. Tom Tennant of Arthur was the aide-de-camp for Lord Louis Mountbatten, British Admiral of the Fleet, during his two visits to Canada. He attended Mountbatten's funeral after he was assassinated by the IRA in 1979.
 Walsh said he believes Arthur had such an impressive turnout of volunteers during the Second World War because there was a similar turnout for the First World War.
 "We were the sons and daughters of local people who volunteered to defend Canada during the First World War. It just seemed to be the natural thing to do when our turn came," Walsh said.
 He said Arthur petitioned the Department of National Defence to have a new Canadian warship named after Canada's most patriotic village. "They told us there is already a vessel named Port Arthur and it would be too confusing to have another."
 Arthur, near the top of Wellington County, is named after Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

 # What we've lost in Big Ten country, in a fall without football
 Zach Osterman
 Indianapolis Star
 View Comments
 BLOOMINGTON – I’ll miss the bagpipes.
 For years now — for as long as I can remember, anyway — bagpipe music has been part of an IU football gameday. The Southern Indiana Pipes and Drums turn out for every home game, marching from tailgate to tailgate to the tune of everything from “Scotland the Brave” to Indiana’s fight song and alma mater. They can be heard for hundreds of yards across the flat, paved lots, their shrill wail as much a part of the backdrop of a college football Saturday here as charcoal smoke and cornhole.
 Once, Indiana would not have played at home until next weekend. Now, Indiana will not play at home this fall. Big Ten football is shut down until further notice, probably Thanksgiving at the earliest. It has become a topic of heated debate, and a political point-scorer for both Republicans and Democrats, but it’s not coming back any time soon.
 The force and fury of that debate drowning out all around it, it feels like we’ve missed an important conversation about what we’ve lost. Beneath the tense, polarized debate over the Big Ten’s postponement flows something I suspect unites nearly all of us.
 We love sports — we make them an essential part of our lives — because they are a communal experience. Something to look forward to at the end of a long week. Something we share with family and friends. Something to measure the passing of our lives.
 That’s what we’ve lost.
 There are, of course, more layers than that.
 Big Ten athletic departments have been brought to their collective knees by this shutdown, their finances much more hand-to-mouth than the average fan realizes. Football brings in the money (two years ago, Indiana reported $52.7 million in football-specific revenue alone, close to 40% of its total revenues) and without it, even the country’s wealthiest departments are hurting.
 The financial reality of the Big Ten’s decision last month has always been the most direct and convincing argument against the idea that the conference’s decision was politically motivated. Big Ten revenue payouts to fully vested members crossed $55 million per school last year. The conference’s television revenues alone would have numbered more than half a billion dollars.
 Instead, Iowa’s cutting sports and borrowing money, Purdue and Indiana are furloughing staffers by the dozen, and Michigan is talking about a potential $100 million budget deficit. All of that disregarding that the people who coach and play these sports love them with a deep, abiding passion.
 The notion that all of this is some sort of political play is nonsensical. Why on earth would the Big Ten do that to itself?
 None of that is meant to dismiss the understandable disappointment and, for some, even pain, felt across the Midwest right now. And not just for fans, but also the small business owners in college towns across the country who know a year without football will leave a massive hole in their wallet.
 No football means no packed hotels, no crowded bars, no big-money weekends that help pay the bills during the inevitably quiet summer months. As one Bloomington restaurant owner told me in May, "In the fall, if we don’t have football, if we don’t have basketball, if we don’t have 40,000 students, that will be painful."
 IU still plans to soldier on with in-person learning, despite significant positivity rates in Greek houses the university is now encouraging to close for the semester. Football, and the fans it would bring to town, are already lost.
 There were no apparent protests in Bloomington on Saturday like there were outside the Big Ten’s suburban Chicago office last month, or like some Michigan parents staged in Ann Arbor this weekend. But it was undeniably strange to sit in my backyard Friday night and hear the echo of Bloomington South’s public address announcer calling out tackles and touchdowns, then drive 10 minutes north to Memorial Stadium on Saturday knowing it probably won’t host football until 2021.
 The parking lot of IU’s 60-year-old stadium has been full this fall, just not with tailgaters. Even now, two weeks into the school year, dozens of metal barriers remain from the comprehensive COVID-19 testing program IU required all on-campus students to undergo before they were allowed to move into their houses and dorms.
 The stadium itself housed the testing center, signs directing students into its west concourse a reminder that it’s the pandemic that pushed football out of the way more than anything else.
 Of course, that isn’t true everywhere. There is college football today — ESPN will cap Week 1 with a fascinating game between Memphis and Arkansas State — but in Big Ten country, the gates remain locked.
 The grassy berm where IU players’ parents have tailgated for 10 years will sit empty. No Greek houses will mass in the fields south of the stadium, across 17th Street. The usual row of satellite trucks won’t pull into town. The RV lot will hold no RVs.
 One of the most emotionally challenging aspects of these past six months is the degree to which it’s felt like time has just stopped. We’ve lost so many of the signposts that guide us week after week. Now, it’s college football’s turn.
 It’s beautiful in Bloomington today, 82 degrees, breezy and cloudless. In a normal world, IU opened the most-anticipated season the program has seen in 25 years Friday night at Wisconsin. In a normal world, I’d be traveling home from Madison while you dissected Michael Penix’s performance. In a normal world, the Hoosiers would turn their attention to a home opener against Ball State in seven days.
 In a normal world, there would be bagpipes.

Cosmic, apocalyptic imagery proliferates the oftentimes opaque lyrics of “Zeros.” The first track, “You Better Believe!!!,” kicks off the record with a rejoiceful, spacey beat that dives head-first into McKenna’s acceptance that humanity, and the planet itself, might have been doomed to fail from the very start. The second verse’s lyrics are particularly telling of McKenna’s intention with the album. As he sings, “The time has come where rocket boots and lasers / Lose their flavours like gum stuck to your heels” and “Oh, I'm sorry, my dear / The asteroid's here,” McKenna comes to terms with the reality that human intentions often only exacerbate our crises, both systemic and interpersonal, rather than heal their root causes. A similar theme can be heard in “Daniel, You’re Still a Child” and “Emily” — two tracks whose slowed- down, conversational sound set them apart from the rest of “Zeros.” The melancholic, almost folksy “Emily” sees McKenna drop all pretenses, and it’s a particular favorite of mine on the album.

Tanto Calderón como Zavala consideraron la negativa una artimaña política, negaron que haya donaciones no identificadas y la exprimera dama anunció que impugnarían la decisión.
 Calderón fue presidente de México de 2006 a 2012 por el conservador Partido de Acción Nacional en el que también militó su esposa hasta que en 2018 intentó contender por la presidencia como independiente pero acabó retirando su candidatura.
 En un vídeo en la cuenta de Twitter de México Libre, Zavala calificó la decisión del INE de “ridícula” y basada en “criterios salidos de ocurrencia” ya que, dijo, las autoridades electorales podían haber corroborado con los bancos la identidad de los donantes.
 Por su parte, el exmandatario aseguró, también en la misma red social, que los donativos se hicieron con tarjeta de crédito a través de una aplicación de teléfono y que “de cada donante proporcionamos copia de credencial, carta y recibo”.
 Sin embargo, el mandatario López Obrador dijo en un video difundido el sábado en sus redes oficiales que la decisión era muestra de las “nuevas circunstancias” que vive México.
 “Si Felipe (Calderón) se robó la Presidencia de la República ¿cómo no va a poder conseguir registro de un partido político, si está acostumbrado a triunfar sin escrúpulos morales de ninguna índole?”, dijo irónicamente en referencia a los comicios de 2006 en los que Calderón fue declarado ganador por el 0,62% de los votos y López Obrador denunció un fraude y protagonizó duras protestas durante meses.
 “Que sigan luchando como hicimos nosotros”, le recomendó. “No hay que rendirse cuando se lucha por una causa justa”.
 De las siete agrupaciones que aspiraban a convertirse en partido solo una lo consiguió, el Partido Encuentro Solidario, sucesor del Partido Encuentro Social, una agrupación de tinte evangélico que apoyó la coalición que llevó a López Obrador a la presidencia hace dos años.

INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM. I rent many high end cars, so I am quite familiar with the bells and whistles of infotainment systems, and I have learned tricks on one car that carry over, so to speak to a different brand, but it took me about one day to learn 80%+ of all functions. For example, getting ambient lights and set them up is not completely intuitive and I had to watch a video on YouTube that taught me how to get it done choosing the colors (you must have the proper package for it, though). The navigation system is pretty good and I do like the fact that it is higher up, although I use the one on my console while driving. But I would prefer a larger screen. I think that both Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 are better visually speaking. But it got me where I needed to go and it provided good directions in all situations except one where it kept sending me up a steep and narrow street only, we found out, to cut the driving distance by about 50-100 yards.
