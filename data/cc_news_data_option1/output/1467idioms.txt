The IMF's twice-yearly World Economic Outlook was prepared for this week's spring meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. Those meetings, along with a gathering of finance ministers and central bankers of the world's 20 biggest economies, are being held virtually for the first time in light of the coronavirus outbreak.

“Barack Obama chose Vice President Biden to be his partner over eight years in the White House, entrusting him with managing the stimulus that saved our economy from a depression, obtaining the deciding vote for the Affordable Care Act, and countless national security priorities,” Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates explained. “By contrast, Senator Sanders explored a primary challenge to President Obama, who he compared to a ‘moderate Republican’ and said was not a ‘progressive.’ As recent history has proven, no quantity of ads can rewrite history — and there’s no substitute for genuinely having the back of the best president of our lifetimes.”

The endorsement could prompt them to reluctantly rally around Biden as a means to defeat the person who Sanders has called "the most dangerous president in modern history." Or, more perilously, the endorsement could make them even more resolute in their support for their preferred candidate, who made no secret of keeping his name on the ballots for the remaining primaries.

Si è perso tempo nel decidere come muoversi e quale fosse la medicina e il percorso giusto per raddrizzare la barca dagli effetti devastanti dell'epidemia da coronavirus e nell'attivare misure a sostegno dell'economia italiana. Un percorso a ostacoli sul piano organizzativo, dopo le scelte scellerate dei governi del passato, che hanno pensato a tagliare preziose risorse in danno del servizio sanitario pubblico e a non tutelare l'economia locale, a causa di vincoli di bilancio anche dell'Unione Europea. Scelte sulle quali responsabilità e irresponsabilità sono palesi. Basta andare a ritroso nel tempo. Ma ora la situazione è alla canna del gas e l'economia langue per i tempi tecnici ma anche lunghi per dare sostegno alle imprese.

"This was a difficult decision for the park, but in light of continued visitation to the park from areas of known community spread, including Anchorage and Fairbanks, these changes are necessary to support the governor's health mandates and travel restrictions, as well as to keep our staff and the surrounding communities safe," Denice Swanke, the park's acting superintendent said in a statement.

As they strive to maintain domestic calm and manage the pandemic, African governments must still face the huge constraints that COVID-19 has further unleashed on their debt-servicing capabilities. Sub-Saharan governments alone owed around USD 583 billion in external debt as of 2018. Shortfalls in national revenues--due to tumbling commodity prices and unavailable domestic tax revenues--are set to whittle African governments' ability to diligently service national debts. Declines in local production and foreign exchange earnings also threaten local currencies with depreciation relative to major currencies, making it even more expensive to service national debts denominated in those foreign currencies. The costs and local prices of imported goods could also rise, potentially raising the cost of living and heightening the risk of social and political unrest in those areas. The recent plea for Chinese debt relief for Africa must have been triggered by an awareness of this dire economic spectre.

Ever notice that right before a big holiday weekend the price of gasoline seems to jump by 10 or more cents a gallon? Yeah, most of us have. But supposedly it's got nothing to do with a gotcha opportunity.
 We field many a call in the newsroom from folks who swear that it's exactly that. The gas companies and stations, they swear, are all in cahoots and know people are going to be hitting the roads, so get 'em in the pocketbooks while they can.
 Now, in what looks like a cruel twist of the knife in the backs of motorists, gas prices have dipped tremendously. Not that I've been out at all the past few days, but word on the street is that gas is below a buck fifty per gallon. For the cheaper grade. It's even dipped to $1.27 in the Shoals. Ware Shoals, that is.
 But who the heck gets to take advantage of that? How many folks, for example, had to hang around home on Easter Sunday eating leftovers instead of traveling to see Mom and Dad, Grandma and Grandpa, for a family gathering?
 Oh sure, now you lower the price at a time when most of us still have the same amount of gas we had when we topped off several weeks ago. And when it was more like $1.70 or something.
 Bet you a gallon of gas that when the travel ban is lifted, either by the governor or the president, who apparently thinks he can tell all the states when to lift their executive orders, that price will soar back toward two bucks. Betcha.

South Carolina won't see its peak day for deaths until May 2 and could see close to 700 die during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the latest projection from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
 While the Seattle-based research center moved the peak back three days from its April 6 forecast, it remains in line with when the state Department of Health and Environmental Control has predicted the state will see peak cases, which is late April to early May.
 IHME also moved up the median for the projected deaths from 442 to 680 after the state reported 12 deaths in a day last week, exceeding the earlier forecast's range for the day. This is about six times the number of people who have died of the flu this season in South Carolina.
 The higher-than-expected daily report also contributed to the models becoming less certain, with deaths by mid-June ranging anywhere from 188 to 2,042. The earlier range was just 305 to 645.
 The forecast released Monday assumes mitigation efforts currently in place, including the closing of schools, restaurant dining rooms and certain businesses deemed nonessential, will remain place.
 Nationally, the research center now predicts 68,841, while the models showed median deaths at 81,766 last week. As of Tuesday morning, nearly 24,000 U.S. deaths had been linked to COVID-19.
 State health officials also increased their projections Monday for how many people will test positive for COVID-19. On May 2, they now predict the state will have 8,677 or so confirmed cases of the virus. On March 25, the state projected 8,053 South Carolinians would test positive by May 2.
 Along with the projection, DHEC notes that it would put the state at 170 cases per 100,000 residents on May 2, which is below the infection rate already seen in some states and the District of Columbia. The states listed all test for COVID-19 at higher rates than South Carolina and most have a densely populated urban center, which can facilitate spread.
 The comparison did not look at North Carolina, which is geographically similar, has only a slightly higher population density and boasts a lower infection rate. As of Tuesday morning, North Carolina had an infection rate of about 48 per 100,000 residents while South Carolina had a rate of 69 per 100,000. The Tar Heel State is expected to peak in the next week and anticipates fewer overall deaths from the virus despite having about twice the population.
 Those rates are based on confirmed cases; DHEC estimates the number of infected South Carolinians is about seven times the confirmed figure.
 While people who contract the fast-spreading respiratory virus only have mild to moderate symptoms, some will experience serious illness or even die. Those most at risk of becoming seriously ill are those who are older or have certain underlying conditions. Among those who have tested positive for COVID-19 in South Carolina, 18.5% of those 80 or older and about 1 in 10 of those their 70s have died, according to data DHEC released last week.
