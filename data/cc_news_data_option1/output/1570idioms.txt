Nobody just forgets about Stephen Curry and allows him to lazily saunter into a wide-open 3 like that. If and when Young gets to Curry's level, he won't have that luxury, either. He rarely has it now, and that's with the Hawks playing in a lot of blowout games that aren't exactly approached with a postseason defensive intensity.


  For the Hawks to become a playoff team, and certainly for Young to be at his most dangerous once he gets there, his off-ball movement has to be much more aggressive. It has to have a shot-hunting urgency to it. You can only do so much damage on the ball when teams are going to do everything they can to take it out of your hands once you start playing in meaningful games.


  To that point, Young is already seeing aggressive, advanced blitzing schemes to force the ball out of his hands. Most times when he passes out of the double, he hardly moves afterward. Again, it's like his work is done. Watch Curry in the clip below, passing out of a double and continuing to move without a second of lapse until he eventually finds an opening.

Two years removed from winning Super Bowl MVP for helping the Philadelphia Eagles capture their first and only Lombardi Trophy, Nick Foles is set to play for his third team in three years. If and when he returns to the City of Brotherly Love as a member of the Chicago Bears, however, he's eager to stay in the good graces of Eagles fans, telling NBC Sports Philadelphia this week that he'd prefer those at Lincoln Financial Field still show him love.

  Acquired by the Bears in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason, Foles may or may not open the 2020 season as Chicago's starter, even though he's got endorsements from three of his former head coaches.

BOSTON - Gov. Charlie Baker hinted Tuesday that he plans to convene a group of public health, academic and business leaders to assemble a "thoughtful framework" for how Massachusetts might be able to resume more normal economic and social life once the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
 At the same press conference in which he announced schools will stay closed through the end of the school year, Baker said he is more focused on the ongoing surge of COVID-19 patients than he is on making a decision about whether to extend restrictions on non-essential businesses beyond May 4. But he started his press conference by saying he wanted to address "what I think is on everybody's mind, which is when does new normal get here?"
 "Right now, the commonwealth is still in the surge ... the facts on the ground tell us that we need to stay strong, continue to socially distance and stay home. While we ask for your full cooperation to get this job done, please know that we're working hard to think about a strategy to reopen the economy," Baker said. "We'll have much more to say about this in the days ahead as we pull together the best and brightest minds from our business and public health and academic communities to work together to put together a thoughtful framework that can work in Massachusetts."
 For weeks, millions of people across Massachusetts have been working from home, if at all, and companies have struggled to find ways to stay in business and connected to consumers. Some states, like Georgia, have already begun to take steps towards restarting economic and social activity, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for states to end the economic shutdowns put in place to contain the spread of the virus.
 Massachusetts last week joined a partnership of northeast states to develop a regional strategy to reopen the economy, but Baker has repeatedly tamped down talk about how Massachusetts plans to reboot business activity and normal daily activities, saying the surge in COVID-19 infections has his full attention.
 "Look, I'm part of the community that would like to see something close to something like a new normal sooner rather than later, but I'm also the person who's looking at all the data everyday and talking to the folks at the command center about what's going on out there," he said Tuesday.
 The governor added, "I'll be damned if the way this works is we go through this thing, we flatten the curve, we do all the stuff we're supposed to do, and then we create some run-up again in the fall because we don't handle the re-entry, the reopening, in a way that actually works and makes sense and keeps people safe."
 He said all of the business leaders he and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito talk with "aren't looking to jump off the deep end of the pier, they're looking to find a way to do something safely." When it comes to making decisions about lifting non-essential business closures, Baker said the "key elements" will be meeting to-be-determined targets that demonstrate "positive trends when it comes either to testing or to hospitalizations."
 Last week, the governor pointed to recent White House guidance that recommended states could begin to resume greater levels of economic activity after documenting 14 days of declining case counts. Tuesday was the fifth straight day that Massachusetts reported fewer new cases than the day before.
 "I do think what happens next is going to be more about guidelines and rules and regulations," he said. "The goal going forward here is going to be to establish prerequisites for when we believe it is safe and appropriate to open the doors, and then make rules and regulations and requirements and capacity to monitor around how businesses in Massachusetts can operate safely."
 Depending on the timeline for lifting some of the restrictions on businesses, other challenges may crop up. Baker announced Tuesday that schools will remain closed through the end of the schoolyear and that non-emergency child care programs will stay closed until June 29, meaning many children will be home for weeks. For workers with young kids, that could complicate plans to return to their jobs sooner than the end of June.
 At the beginning of his press conference Tuesday, Baker got a bit personal and said that he's in the same boat as everyone else who wants to be able to leave their house, visit family members and get back to routines. But he also said the sacrifices being made now are worth it to keep the pandemic from being as deadly as some early projections suggested.
 "I think we all want to move on from this, believe me. But I think it's really important for people to understand what's at stake. I can't wait to see my 91-year-old dad again, but I don't want to see him unless the circumstances and the situation and the rules of engagement are right, and that the data, the prerequisites about what's actually going on on the ground here in Massachusetts supports that kind of thing," he said. "Doing it wrong could create more hardship for everyone in the long run and we're going to do everything we can to avoid that."
 The governor added, "So, right now, people need to dig deep and stay put."

Dear Dave,   I'm debt-free except for my home, and it is all because I started following your plan four years ago. I'm even on track to pay off my mortgage in eight years. With all the scary economic news out there, I'd love to talk to my family about following your advice, too. Do you have any suggestions for doing this without sounding like a know-it-all or that I am bragging?   Lacey


  Dear Lacey,   It's been my experience that when it comes to family, words don't always do the trick. There's an old saying that goes, "Those convinced against their will are of the same opinion still." Some people have been brainwashed into believing credit cards and debt are an unavoidable part of life. They're stuck in their ways, and nothing anyone can say or do is going to change that.   I've been fortunate enough to help millions of people change their lives, get out of debt and take control of their finances. But there are millions more who will never listen. They'll just keep going deeper and deeper into debt, and never realize the real problem is the person they see in the mirror every morning.   The truth is, you can make irrefutable arguments against credit cards. People who use them spend more than those who use cash or debit cards. Research has proven this. You don't need one to rent a car, get a hotel room, or buy airline tickets. A debit card will do all those things without piling up debt. For an emergency fund, you can simply save up cash. It takes some discipline and hard work, but relying on credit when things go wrong is a really bad idea. It's a trap.   If they won't listen to all these truths, try telling them your story. Let them know you understand from experience how hard breaking old habits can be. Emphasize how amazing your life has been since you decided to actively control your money, instead allowing a lack of money to control you.   Congratulations, Lacey. I'm proud of you for working so hard and being disciplined. I hope you can be an influence on others in your family, and help lead them to a place of financial peace, too!   Dave

Columns share an author's personal perspective and are often based on facts in the newspaper's reporting.
 Twenty-six years ago, Philip K. Howard, a New York attorney wrote a little book called "The Death of Common Sense." It's a book about how law has the power to suffocate America. In light of the emergency circumstances facing America with the COVID-19, the book should be required reading for anyone in public life. It might even curtail the growing revolts by restless Americans reacting against their state governors now in process in various parts of the nation.
 Certainly, these are unprecedented times. Government has a legitimate role in protecting us even against ourselves and our own reckless behavior.
 It becomes complicated, nevertheless, in the United States because of the Bill of Rights, which is enshrined in the mind of every American. Unfortunately, it gets clumsy when neither citizens nor bureaucrats think very deeply about the connection between government and how law actually works in specific situations.
 Government can't do anything except what the law allows. That's why it is no coincidence that almost every encounter with government is an exercise in frustration. It's almost a natural paradox. Government attempts to do the right thing. Yet, in almost every case, it achieves the worst of two worlds. It offers a system of comprehensive regulation that goes too far while it also does too little to solve the real problem. The rigidity of the law precludes the rightful exercise of judgment at the time and place of the activity.
 Consider this: "You can fish in a row boat but not in a motor boat" as one state has decreed during the current COVID-19 crisis. Now, that's the kind of thing that drives people mad. It's an example of how the government wanders into process, which tells us not what to do but how to do it. Worse than that, it shatters trust. People rightfully conclude that government just isn't capable of doing anything right. Sadly enough, there are too many examples of that.
 In these difficult times when local and state authorities are doing the best they can to protect people, they need to be careful about legislating universal requirements that leave no room for common sense or appropriate personal judgment.
 Fairness is important. People think that precise rules assure fairness and "cuts off loopholes." Actually it happens to be the other way around. Loopholes only exist because of precise rules.
 Law, is often coercive, but it doesn't have to be that way all the time. Law can also encourage people to adapt to changing circumstances. Laws, which attempt to detail everything results in a system of laws against its own people.
 Fortunately, Massachusetts has been spared the open revolts going on in other states. That's a tribute to our public officials who understand the balance between government responsibility and individual rights.
 The average police officer makes more sound decisions in a single hour, than most judges make in a month. A good cop understands that discretion depends upon common sense. Public officials should follow that example.
 Dissatisfaction with government is not caused by government's goals, but rather by government's techniques. What makes people crazy is not what government aims to do - but how the law actually works.
 Law is the precious instrument of freedom. Without law, there would be anarchy, and we would eventually fall under the control of whoever gets power. On the other hand, too much law, we are learning, can have the same effect. Governors are learning that human nature is complicated. The idea that people will go along if only the rules are clear enough is simply not true, particularly if they feel that their rights are threatened.
 The balance between the Bill of Rights and our government's needs to be protective in this new COVID-19 frontier is critical. However, that's where common sense comes in. Let's keep the regulations few, clear, and uncomplicated.
 Americans really are special. We can do almost anything. We will figure it out.

Anthony Quinton reported that a man threatened him with a gun on April 18. Quinton said he was in his front yard when he heard someone yelling from the road. He said he turned around and a man in a Dodge truck drove by slowly. Quinton said he felt that the man was trying to antagonize him. A few minutes later, the man was on Quinton's property and said he was trying to find a gun in the brush. Quinton said the man found the gun and threatened to shoot him while there were children outside. The man ran toward the truck and jumped in the bed before it took off down the road. Quinton said the truck kept driving by the property at a slow rate of speed. Rye took Quinton's statement and drove around the area, but didn't locate the man or the truck.

As for Brady, he started by saying this was "an exciting moment for me in my life" and quickly shifted focus to getting up to speed with the Buccaneers offense, which appeared to be a point of emphasis in his early comments.


  "The expectation for me is to come in and do what I feel is right for the organization and that is to be a great team player and I'm going to do everything I can to get up to speed with all the things that I need to do and what my responsibilities are," Brady said.


  When speaking of his former team in the New England Patriots, Brady had nothing but fond things to say about the club, but tried to steer clear of solely talking about his departure.


  "I leave there with such great admiration for the people in that organization," he said. "It is a first-class organization in every way and I wanted to leave it that way, too."

Los presidentes de comunidad discutieron sobre las medidas que se emprendieron desde el pasado 20 de marzo, en una sesión extraordinaria en donde se habían suspendido eventos masivos en las comunidades, pero que a la fecha se han desarrollado en algunas comunidades, en las que algunos representantes de las localidades no han cumplido el acuerdo.
 La presidenta de la comunidad de La Cueva, Reyna Lanzagorta Arroyo, expuso la necesidad de que todos los presidentes cumplan con el acuerdo, “algunos de nosotros hemos cumplido con la disposición, pero cuando existen celebraciones en algunas otras comunidades nos echan abajo el trabajo, nos hacen quedar mal a todos los integrantes del cabildo, por lo que invito a todos los presidentes de comunidad a que nos comprometamos a seguir este acuerdo, lo cual permitirá suspender los eventos que se realicen sin permiso de la autoridad”, manifestó en pleno del cabildo.
 Más adelante, varios presidentes de comunidad manifestaron su preocupación por que, algunos párrocos, continúan realizando celebraciones de bautizos, bodas, quince años, entre otras celebraciones religiosas, lo que propicia a la desobediencia social y dificulta a las autoridades locales el cumplimiento de las disposiciones del Gobierno Federal.

In a draw down, the number of ballots previously accepted in error are then chosen at random from the pile of previously accepted ballots by the Board of Canvassers. Those ballots are then subtracted from vote totals.


  The reason the ballots are chosen at random, and not the incorrectly filled out ballot removed itself, is because ballots are anonymous. Once it is removed from the envelope it came in, which includes the voter’s information, there is no way to trace it back to the ballot to which it belongs.


  The last unit that needed to be re-recounted includes Caledonia’s wards 11, 14, 15 and 17. Due to lack of time on Tuesday, those tallies will be updated on Wednesday.

The bill mandates that HHS write a report about where the funding went 60 days after the bill is signed into law, and that it continues to release reports every 60 days until the spending is depleted.


  Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said in a statement that he was concerned the money "will not reach the people and the places that need it most." He laid out a formula urging HHS to prioritize rural hospitals and healthcare providers who have a large number of patients covered by Medicaid.


  The legislation sets aside $6 million for the HHS Office of the Inspector General to oversee where the funding goes. The oversight office has to write a report about the funding within three years.


  ## Researchers will develop tests and public health workers will screen large numbers of people


  Difficulty in achieving widespread coronavirus testing has been widely cited as one of the reasons the US was so slow to get a handle on the pandemic.


  That effort has been speeding up -- Dr. Deborah Birx, who has been coordinating the coronavirus task force for the White House, recently said there were 1 million tests available weekly. But the progress across states has been uneven, and the early tests didn't work.

The legislative text is similar to the $100 billion that was allocated in the CARES Act, which set up a dispute over whether funding was being properly allocated. Providers across the board, from nursing homes to pediatric services, have had to scale back their services and spend more on protective equipment, causing massive losses throughout the industry.


  As with the CARES Act, decisions about how to allocate the bill's funding are left to the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. That means providers across healthcare will be lobbying the agency for money.
