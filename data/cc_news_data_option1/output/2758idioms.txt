Have you _tried_ looking for decent kids’ stuff in your local charity shop recently? I bet Stella Tennant hasn’t – or if she has found anything with life still left in it that’s only because she probably lives somewhere where people are rich enough to cast out actual labels rather than washed out t-shirts from George at Asda or Sainsbury’s Tu. Tennant even admitted that in their house second hand counts as something her 14-year-old daughter Iris has raided from her own wardrobe, that is to say, the wardrobe of a supermodel.
 Of course we need to stop buying new clothes – we bought more than 50 million single-use items of clothing THIS SUMMER ALONE – but it is going to take more than one well-meaning model to get us to ditch our passion for fast fashion.
 A sale rail is like crack for most shoppers, especially if you’re feeling a bit down or in need of a pick-me-up – and by “most shoppers” I mean me. A sparkly silver cape I, ahem, stumbled upon in Zara, now hanging reproachfully in my wardrobe, is testament to my own weak-will although, in my defence, I do try to buy more from charity shops.
 Again the trouble is it’s often hard to find anything worth the bother because the quality is often so lousy in the first place. Here, towns like Deal with elderly populations can come up trumps because clothes being ditched by an older generation tend to have been better made in the first place. I’m especially fond of a 1980s Jaeger skirt, or this year’s favourite, one by Coats Viyella that washes like a dream.
 It’s all very well putting the onus on shoppers but the quality issue is one for retailers. They’re the ones cutting costs and selling stuff that barely has one life let alone two. No wonder 300,000 tonnes of clothes end up in UK landfills every year; they’re unwearable.

Fauci's public contradictions of Trump have been viewed by the president as a personal affront and have caused some in the West Wing to sour on the doctor, officials say. Some say that, while he is critical of the president in media interviews, he is largely deferential behind closed doors.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine voters did much of their work ahead of Tuesday's primary election, casting tens of thousands of absentee ballots as House Speaker Sara Gideon faced two other Democrats to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in a race that’s critical to the battle for control of the Senate. Three Republicans were also facing off in the 2nd Congressional District for the opportunity to try to unseat first-term Democratic Rep. Jared Golden. Also on the ballot are two bond proposals worth $120 million. Because of the pandemic, state officials encouraged voters to use mail-in absentee ballots instead of voting in person, but in-person voting was still available as an option. In the Democratic Senate primary, Gideon faced challenges by activist Betsy Sweet and attorney Bre Kidman. Gideon, who's raised a staggering $23 million, received early backing from the Democratic establishment, securing an endorsement from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and has kept a laser focus on Collins, much to the chagrin of her challengers. Kidman and Sweet criticized the Washington influence and said Gideon’s vow to take money out of politics rang hollow as her own money grew into the biggest haul for a political candidate in state history. The winner of the primary is entitled to about $3.7 million from a crowdsourced fund for Collins’ challenger that was established during the Senate fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation. Some Democrats were furious over Collins’ vote in favor of Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s controversial appointee. Collins has raised $16 million. The four-term senator is a household name in the state with a reputation for independence, but Democrats are battering her over her critical 2018 support...
