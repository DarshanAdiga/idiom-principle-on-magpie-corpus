  The dad-of-two said: “Nobody in Sweden is in denial about that. The argument here is that, in the long-run, the number of deaths will be similar across the board. Time will tell.


  “I generally support the Swedish approach as it has been consistent from the start, as opposed to Ireland where they keep chopping and changing the restrictions.


  “Swedes trust their government more and tend to do what they are told.


  “The government is treating the public like adults and they are responding by keeping their distance and following the rules; it’s a long-term approach here.”


  Sweden’s per capita death rate is much higher than its Nordic neighbours at 58.5 per 100,000, compared to 11.7 in Denmark and 6.32 in Finland.


  Ireland’s per capita rate is 37.2.

Lo stringato successivo comunicato stampa della società rossonera, proprio due righe è giunto invece alle 14,38 di una domenica che doveva essere di calcio e che invece è ancora di…covid-19. La partita è stata rinviata a causa di un caso di positività riscontrato nel gruppo della squadra rossonera. Naturalmente rimane riservato il nome del calciatore contagiato. Nelle prossime ore giocatori e staff tecnico e dirigenziale verranno sottoposti ad un nuovo tampone. L’auspicio, naturalmente, è che non vi siano altri positivi anche perchè la Lucchese dovrebbe tornare in campo già mercoledì (ore 18,30) nel turno infrasettimanale che dovrebbe vederla di scena allo Speroni di Busto Arsizio sul campo della Pro Patria. Certo che il diffondersi in modo quasi esponenziale del virus e di questa seconda ondata che sta facendo registrare numero importanti, rimette in discussione e in pericolo il prosieguo del campionato ma soprattutto la sua regolarità.

 JERUSALEM, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Israel is due to send delegates to Bahrain on Sunday to formalise nascent relations and broaden Gulf cooperation that Washington has promoted as an anti-Iran bulwark and potential economic bonanza.
 Bahrain followed the United Arab Emirates in agreeing last month to normalise ties with Israel, stunning Palestinians who had demanded statehood before any such regional rapprochement.
 The breakthrough, overseen by U.S. President Donald Trump, is a foreign policy flourish ahead of his reelection bid next month. For the U.S. allies, it is a chance to close ranks more overtly on Iran.
 Sunday's delegation, led by Israeli National Security Adviser Meir Ben- Shabbat, will be accompanied by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, whose office said the mission seeks "expanded economic cooperation" among Israel, Bahrain and UAE.
 An official involved in the visit said Israel and Bahrain would sign a communique upgrading their relationship: from the declaration of intent delivered at a White House ceremony on Sept. 15 to a formal establishment of ties.
 The delegates travel to Manama on El Al flight 973, a nod to Bahrain's telephone code. The Israeli airliner will overfly Saudi Arabia, an accommodation by the Gulf powerhouse that has so far resisted U.S. appeals to normalise ties with Israel.
 Mnuchin and another senior Trump aide, Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz, will continue on Monday to UAE, whose accord with Israel has uncorked bilateral commerce. On Tuesday, the U.S. dignitaries will accompany the UAE's first delegation to Israel.
 Though less oil-rich than UAE, Bahrain - host to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet - has geo-strategic significance.
 Ruled by a Sunni Muslim monarchy, it was the only Gulf Arab state to experience a sizeable pro-democracy uprising, led by the Shi'ite majority population, in the 2011 "Arab Spring".
 The Israel deal drew anger among Bahrainis at home and abroad. Manama has said the deal protects its interests from Iran.
 A Sept. 13 report by Israel's Intelligence Ministry saw potential for defence cooperation with Bahrain, describing it as threatened by "Shiite political sedition, directed by Iran and its proxies".
 Israel could also help Bahrain with renewable energy, food security and banking and finance technologies, it said. (Reporting by Dan Williams; Editing by Christopher Cushing)

Port of Gdansk Authority SA and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority signed a Letter of Intent regarding mutual cooperation with Ukrainian ports on October 13 in Odessa, the PGA said in a media release.      "I trust that the cooperation between the Port of Gdansk and the administration of Ukrainian seaports will become the foundation for a common intermodal corridor. The memorandum signed today fits perfectly into the concept of the Three Seas Initiative, but also the Trans-Caspian Corridor," said Minister of Infrastructure, Andrzej Adamczyk.      The document was signed during the official visit of President Andrzej Duda to Ukraine. The presidents of Ukraine and Poland opened the Ukrainian-Polish Transport and Logistics Forum in Odessa, and the agreement between the Port of Gdansk and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority was signed in their presence. The meeting was attended by the ministers of infrastructure of Poland and Ukraine, Andrzej Adamczyk and Vladyslav Krykliy, respectively. Signing the letter will strengthen economic ties between the Port of Gdansk and Ukrainian ports.      "The ports of Ukraine and the Port of Gdansk have decided on an exchange of knowledge and experience, which in the future can optimise the logistics chains and therefore increase the volumes of goods transshipped by the ports and contribute to better trade relations between the countries," says Lukasz Greinke, President of the Port of Gdansk Authority SA.      The Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority was established in 2013 and it associates 13 ports of our eastern neighbour. Its headquarters is in Odessa, Ukraine's largest port. Located in the north-west part of the Black Sea, at the intersection of historically established trade routes between the East and West, it covers an area of 160 ha. It can accommodate and handle vessels of lengths up to 330 m, drafts up to 13.5 m and widths up to 50 m. There are a total of 55 transshipment quays in the port area. The port includes 9 bulk cargo handling terminals, 6 grain terminals, 2 container terminals, a passenger and oil terminal, 2 terminals dedicated to handling tropical fruit and oils, and also one for refrigerated goods. Container terminals are designed to handle over 650,000 TEU annually. The passenger terminal is one of the largest in the Black Sea and can accommodate up to 5 cruise ships at the same time and sees up to 4 million tourists a year.      Although the ports of Ukraine and Poland are in different geographical locations and operate in different water areas, their mutual needs and goals are very similar. It is difficult to compare the ports of both countries in terms of competitiveness as they mostly deal with different cargo. However, in terms of port infrastructure planning, innovations in cargo and ship handling technology and methods for overcoming obstacles, it is essential to ensure cooperation and the exchange of experience between these ports. There are great prospects for cooperation between the Polish and Ukrainian ports. One of the priority directions is seeking and attracting transit cargo, e.g. from Central Asia or Turkey. The signed agreement will allow us to strengthen cooperation and increase the competitiveness of both ports in respect of their cargo facilities.

Aloe vera is considered a super-food by some, an everyday vegetable by many more, and a complete mystery by still others, but, once a spear of aloe has been prepared, it can be blended into a drink, or cut into cubes and used in many of the same recipes as cubes of meat or fish veggies, or fruit: in soups, stews, and curries, or julienned for salads and ceviche. Because it's so neutral, it works just as well in sweet dishes; try adding the crystal clear cubes to a fruit salad, or poach cubes of aloe in fruit juice and serve over ice cream or yogurt. With its skin removed, its texture is tender, similar to an extra firm jelly, though mucilaginous or slimy. But that slime can and should be rinsed away.
