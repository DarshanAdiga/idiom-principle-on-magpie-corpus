SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court isn't the nation's only judicial battleground. The high courts in a number of states are on the ballot Tuesday in races that will determine whether Republicans or Democrats have a majority, and the stakes are high for both sides. This year alone, state supreme courts have been thrust into the spotlight to decide politically charged cases over voting rights, race and governors' coronavirus orders. Next year, it could be abortion, health care and redistricting. Among the most hotly contested races are the ones for two high court seats in Michigan, where a Republican-leaning majority has undercut emergency virus restrictions by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer has been openly feuding with the justices after a 4-3 partisan vote in early October that invalidated her emergency health orders. “The Supreme Court decision in my state has created a lot of confusion and worked to undermine the work that we’ve done here,” Whitmer said. “We crushed our COVID spike early, our economy rebounded. ... It’s all at risk.” Whitmer’s administration quickly reinstated virus measures under a different law, but the governor said the high-court ruling has fostered public confusion about the need to wear masks and maintain social distancing. Michigan's virus cases and deaths are again spiking. The state's seven-day average for new daily cases has risen over the past two weeks from 1,488.57 per day to 2,852.43 as of Thursday. The rushed U.S. Supreme Court confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, coming just days before the presidential election, has cast a spotlight on the growing politicization of the nation's courts. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, have spoken openly about...

New Oregon school reopening metrics, unveiled Friday morning, will take effect immediately and will allow close to 130,000 students statewide to return to classrooms, after most schools being closed to in-person learning since March due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
 The new rules allow every single student in Jefferson County and Culver school districts to return to school full-time. But a corresponding list of eligible counties contradicts the new metrics, leaving the reopening status of schools in Deschutes and Crook counties unclear.
 Arguably the biggest changes in the new metrics are how COVID-19 cases are counted — counties must meet a benchmark over a two-week average, rather than meet it for three weeks in a row — and much higher case count and test- positivity benchmarks. The more lenient rules for elementary students also now include all elementary students, not just those in grades K-3.
 To be in the "green zone" and bring back all K-12 students, a county must now have fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents in a two-week average — or less than 30 total cases over that two-week span for small-population counties like Crook and Jefferson — and a county test positivity rate of 5%.
 This is a significantly easier benchmark to meet than the old metrics — counties previously had to have 10 or fewer cases per 100,000 residents and a 5% or lower positivity rate to welcome back all students. It's also more lenient for the old benchmark for bringing back K-3 students, which was 30 or fewer cases per 100,000 residents.
 The new metrics' "yellow zone" — where elementary can be taught in-person or hybrid, but the state recommends older students stay home — is a county case rate between 50 and 99.9 cases per 100,000 residents and a county test positivity rate between 5% and 7.9%. Small counties can have between 30 and 44 total cases in a two-week period.
 Counties reach the "orange" transitional zone if they have between 100 and 200 cases per 100,000 residents and a county test positivity rate between 8% and 10%. Small counties can have between 45 and 60 total cases.
 If a county in the orange zone has upward-trending COVID-19 numbers, the school district and local health authority must decide whether or not students should return to distance learning. If the county's COVID-19 numbers are trending downward, all students must stay in distance learning until a county reaches the yellow zone.
 Finally, in the "red zone" — when a county has more than 200 cases per 100,000 residents or more than 60 total cases for small counties, along with a test positivity rate of more than 10% — distance learning is mandatory.
 There is an exception to the metrics for rural schools with fewer than 75 students that are located more than 25 miles from a town of at least 3,000 residents. Those schools can reopen if their attendance area, as well as the closest city where many families shop and work, have no COVID-19 community spread.
 This exception applies to a few one-room schools in Crook County and Jefferson County School districts, such as Brothers School and Big Muddy School.
 Any school district currently teaching students in-person that is currently in the red zone must transition all students back to distance learning by Jan. 4, 2021.
 The COVID-19 numbers from the past two weeks place Jefferson and Deschutes counties in the green zone, meaning all students could return to in-person learning. Crook County, which has had a sharp uptick in COVID-19 cases in the past couple weeks, landed in the yellow zone — that means elementary students can return, but the state recommends older students stay home.
 However, Gov. Kate Brown's office sent the media a list of counties that were eligible, partly eligible and not eligible to re-open schools, and this list contradicts with the actual COVID-19 numbers and the new metrics. According to this list, no school in Crook County can open, and only elementary schools in Deschutes County can open.
 A spokesperson from the Oregon Department of Education told The Bulletin Friday morning that state officials are looking into these contradictions.

We had started focusing on the rural market 7-8 years ago and we continue to open our sales and service network and spare-part network in the rural areas, says RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki. What are lead indicators telling us about the demand scenario? Is the recovery a result of the pent-up demand or do you see it sustaining going ahead as well.The general assessment is that the growth in demand partly reflects the pent-up demand, left over from even 2019-20. In addition to that, there was pent-up demand for the current year. So, certainly pent-up demand would have been a factor for higher sales this quarter. In addition to this, there was the factor of people wanting to use personal transport and avoiding shared transport -- be it metro or buses. The rural sector has performed very well because of good harvest following excellent monsoon. General optimism prevails in the rural sector that things are going to be okay till the next year at least. These are all positive factors which have contributed to the growth of the sales in this period now. It is very difficult to predict growth sustainability because while some of the factors like pent-up demand and need for personal transport will play out, rural demand will remain strong going forward. But the worry is about urban demand. Some sectors of the economy are unlikely to grow in the near future to anything like the past rates or performance like the hospitality industry, the entertainment industry and the travel and tourism industry. All of them have been very hard hit and they were fairly large consumers of automobile products. That is going to remain negative. We have witnessed the fall in GDP this year and it will take some time for it to get back to normal. This means lower per capita incomes and that will reduce people’s purchasing power. There is worry on the urban front as to how long pent-up demand and personal transport requirements will continue and that is why we are keeping our views open on what will happen going forward after December. Does that mean Maruti and OEMs at large will now be chasing the rural demand and tap more into regions where their penetration is relatively lowlike rural, semi-urban, tier III type cities?Maruti has been focusing on the rural markets not just this year but for last many years and it is a result of that concentration of efforts on opening outlets for sale, opening outlets for service, employing local people for sales of cars in areas which have resulted in the contribution of the rural market to total sales of about 40%. We saw that the rural market was going to become a growing market in the years to come and we had started this effort seven-eight years ago and this is continuing because we continue to open our sales and service network and spare-part network in the rural areas. Other companies are also seeing the strength of the rural demand and they will also be spanning out in the rural areas. The share of hatchbacks has gone up to 62%. Can we expect the share of smaller cars and hatchbacks to expand beyond these levels over the medium term?We should expect too much of an increase over the current level. Maybe there will be a small increase but the number is already very high. There is also a big market growth in the SUV segment and that will continue. The market for people buying the bigger sedans is not going to go away. So. unless there is a substantial increase in the total demand for cars and the people at the lower end of the market are enabled somehow to buy cars as they become more affordable, then the percentage may go up. But with the existing conditions, there can’t be too much change in percentage. Given that the share of cars in the sub Rs 10-lakh category is about 60% compared to the market level of 50%, could average realisations be under pressure or are there no concerns there?This is not an area of pressure for us. The average realisation is an outcome of the product mix and the product mix reflects what the customers want and the manufacturer has to meet what the customer wants. I cannot artificially increase my realisation per vehicle by trying to sell vehicles that a customer does not want. We place too much importance on this average realisation and think that this is a pressure point and we must do something about it. No, we follow the market, we follow the consumer. You have spoken a lot about the economy taking its own time to get back up and running to the pre Covid levels. How would something like a GST rate cut feature right now? You know there also has to be a supply situation. Merely creating demand while there is no supply also does not make sense because it will mean a lot of revenue to the government which is not required at the moment. That is why I have been talking about a GST cut in a longer term or a medium-term scenario to increase the percentage of growth. At the moment, in Q3 of the current financial year, till December the supply and demand are well matched and there is no point in increasing the demand now. But if in the next financial year, demand falls and there is an increasing gap between supply and demand, that is the time when the government needs to look at all the factors which are influencing demand including GST. But that is not the only factor.

Receiving treats has evolved from the soul cakes or apples of ancient times to more tasty fare. In the 1940s, homemade treats of candied apples, popcorn balls, cookies were offered, usually unwrapped and presented on trays for children to help themselves. Rice Krispy Treats, created by a Kellogg employee and Campfire Girl leader as a fundraiser, became a treat favorite when the recipe appeared on the cereal box in the early 1940s. Chicken Feed, a candy from the 1880s, found new popularity in the 1940s with a different name, Candy Corn. The end of wartime sugar rationing in 1947 meant companies flooded the market with candy perfect for giving, and the 1950s availability of Devil's Food cake mixes made them a standard, perfectly named cupcake treat.

Netflix anunció un aumento en los precios de sus servicios en Estados Unidos y encendió las alarmas de los usuarios de la plataforma de streaming de series y películas en Argentina.
 “Los suscriptores actuales serán notificados a través de un correo electrónico y también recibirán una notificación en la aplicación en los próximos 30 días. El tiempo se basará según el ciclo de pago de cada miembro”, confirmó un portavoz de Netflix al portal de noticias “USA Today”.
 Con el aumento, el Plan Estándar, que permite usar dos pantallas al mismo tiempo, pasará de 12,99 dólares mensuales a 13,99.
 El Plan Premium, que permite el uso en simultáneo de cuatro pantallas Ultra HD, aumentará de 15,99 dólares mensuales a 17,99.
 ¿AUMENTA NETFLIX EN ARGENTINA?
 El anuncio pone en vilo a los suscriptores de Argentina, quienes además del importe, deben abonar el impuesto PAIS del 35 % por tratarse de un servicio contratado en moneda extranjera.
 Ante la noticia del aumento en Estados Unidos, desde Netflix llevaron tranquilidad a los usuarios de los demás países del mundo que utilizan la plataforma y aseguraron que “el incremento de precios no incluye ni es un indicativo de un cambio global en los precios”, es decir, que por el momento sólo aplicará para el territorio estadounidense y no habrá aumentos para el servicio contratado en Argentina.
 El portavoz de la plataforma de streaming mencionó en ese sentido que existe “un rango de planes para que la gente pueda elegir el precio que mejor se ajuste a su presupuesto”.
 Según los precios actuales de la plataforma en pesos y sin impuestos, el Plan Básico continúa en $199, el Plan Estándar en $319 y el Premium en $449.
 Incluso, ofrecen un 50 % de descuento los dos primeros meses para nuevos usuarios y la posibilidad de cambia a un plan inferior o superior en cualquier momento.

TOKYO — Fans living in Japan who bought tickets for the postponed Tokyo Olympics have been guaranteed refunds, the local organizing committee said Friday.
 This does not apply to fans who have purchased tickets outside Japan through so-called Authorized Ticket Resellers appointed by national Olympic committees. Many have already set terms for refunds, which vary by nation or territory.
 Fans in Japan who already know they cannot use their tickets next year can get their money back by applying online for refunds during the period Nov. 10-30. The Paralympic period is Dec. 1-21.
 Organizers also said that refunds would be made if limited seating were available at venues because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “As the host there is a possibility that we may not be able to provide spectating opportunities to a part of the ticket holders," Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya said, speaking in Japanese during an on-line briefing. "In that case we will provide a refund.”
 The ticket situation —- like everything else surrounding next year's postponed Olympics — is up in the air. Conditions will depend on the pandemic.
 Organizers and the International Olympic Committee say they intend to open the Olympics on July 23, 2021. But there are few details so far about exactly how this can happen — with or without a vaccine, using quarantines, or rapid testing.
 The IOC and Tokyo organizers are running several task forces looking at ways to handle immigration and COVID-19. Japan has been relatively safe in the pandemic with about 1,750 deaths attributed to the coronavirus. But conditions elsewhere haven't been as good.
 “You’re going to have to be comfortable being uncomfortable for the next six to nine months because there is no certainty in terms of what will happen,” Ken Hanscom, the chief operating officer of the Los Angeles-based firm TicketManager, told AP in an interview.
 Hanscom isn’t connected with Olympic ticketing, but his company manages big- event tickets for corporate clients. He’s also organized a popular Facebook page that’s a go-to for Tokyo ticket information.
 The big question for Tokyo is: How to let 15,400 Olympic and Paralympic athletes into Japan, along with thousands of officials, judges, sponsors, media and broadcasters. Add to this the issue of fans. Will non-Japanese be allowed to attend? Or will it be only Japanese?
 A major concern for the IOC is getting the Games on television, since selling broadcast rights provides 73% of its income. Another 18% is from 14 top sponsors.
 Tokyo organizers have budgeted $800 million in income from ticket sales in Japan and aboard, their third largest source of income. Any shortfall could stress an already stretched budget.
 Organizers say 4.48 million Olympic tickets have been sold in Japan, with 970,000 tickets for the Paralympics. Organizers say a total of 7.8 million Olympic tickets had been available overall.
 Hidenori Suzuki, the organizing committee's deputy executive director of marketing, though he had very specific local numbers, said he did not know how many tickets had been sold outside Japan.
 “We do not have an accurate figure," he said. He suggested it was 10-20% of the overall total, which could mean anything between 780,000 and 1.56 million tickets.
 Tokyo says it is spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics. But a government audit last year said it was likely twice that much. All but $5.6 billion is public money.
 In addition, neither the organizers nor the government have said how much the one-year delay will cost, with most estimates at between $2 billion or $3 billion.
 The University of Oxford said in September that Tokyo was the most expensive Summer Olympics on record.

The whole bap really was cooked to perfection in my expert opinion, and only took around 20 minutes to come. The blue sky sausage was to die for, smoky in taste and a nice, meaty texture. I really enjoyed the bacon which was lovely and crispy, and the fried egg was super runny (who doesn’t love a runny egg?). They definitely didn’t skimp on the filling for the breakfast roll and by the time I had finished it my hands were a right mess! The bap itself was also a good size and was very filling - I would 100% have it again.

He told him if he didn’t, he would spend three months at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services. For count two, he also placed the defendant on four months’ probation and warned him if he failed to keep the peace during that time frame, he would pay a $500 fine or spend six months in prison. Finally, Magistrate Armbrister fined Robinson $1,000 for attacking his daughter with a stove burner. He said if he didn’t pay that fine, he could risk spending nine months behind bars.

The ECB yesterday announced that they will be doing another stimulus. They think the economy needs further easing measures and in the US, irrespective of which government comes in, there will be a fiscal stimulus package of roughly $2 trillion. Depending on Democrats or the Republicans, the number could change a little bit but by and large they are both aligned on one aspect, which is that the US economy needs more fiscal stimulus. In turn that should lead to a weaker US dollar which tends to result in more positive flows to emerging market assets and emerging market equities in particular. In that context, India should also benefit.

COVID-19 restrictions in North Carolina may be keeping people out of public places, including the normal Bearfootin' Bears auction in downtown Hendersonville, but they haven't put a damper on the city's generosity.
   
 This year, the 18th annual auction had to take place entirely online, but that didn't stop it from breaking the previous spending record by a wide margin.
   
 This year, each of the 20 bears sold brought in at lest $2,000, and the highest-selling bear, Thea, brought in $9,000.
   
 Those sales helped the total raised this year reach $84,109, a $26,700 increase from last year's record of more than $57,000 and a $36,900 increase over the total from 2018.
   
 "It really just shows the care that's in our community, and how much they want to support our local nonprofits," said Dowtown Manager Jamie Carpenter. "And how much they like the bears."
   
 Thea was painted by Miriam Hughes and Laura Bell, Carpenter said, and was based on the Greek goddess Thea, a goddess of light.
   
 Proceeds from each bear benefit a local nonprofit, and the proceeds from Thea's sale will go to the United Way of Henderson County.
   
 After Thea, the second-, third- and fourth-place bears were all purchased for a buy-it-now price of $7,500 each.
   
 This year, everything happened virtually, including lots of promotion from Meredith Freidheim on Facebook, Carpenter said, part of what contributed to the record-breaking bear sales.
   
 Having it online really helped to remind people in advance of the bidding, she said.
   
 On Saturday, Oct. 24, weeks of virtual bidding was wrapped up by the final hour of the auction being held live online telethon-style, Carpenter said, and a lot of the total 220 bids from 72 bidders came in then.
   
 With the success they saw this year, she said, downtown organizers are looking to carry some of those virtual aspects into next year's event.
   
 "We are overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude," Carpenter said in the release. "It's clear that the Bearfootin' Bears are as beloved as ever, and we're taking away a new perspective from the virtual version of this event for next year."
   
 Organizers definitely want to have an in-person event next year, she said, but will likely pull some of the online elements from this year's virtual auction into the mix.
   
 Anyone interested in sponsoring a 2021 bear or getting involved with next year's auction can contact events coordinator Friedheim at mfreidheim@hvlnc.gov or 233-3205.

Banca Transilvania se implica in dezvoltarea educatiei in agribusiness si in cresterea afacerilor de familie din domeniul agriculturii prin lansarea programului Agro Intergeneration, in parteneriat cu Universitatea de Stiinte Agricole si Medicina Veterinara Cluj-Napoca (USAMV). BT si USAMV pregatesc terenul pentru un viitor cat mai rodnic prin cursuri destinate dezvoltarii competentelor in domeniul tehnologiei, managementului si marketingului in domeniul agricol. Angajamentul Bancii Transilvania este sa contribuie la repozitionarea agriculturii in Romania prin educatie, finantare, cresterea tehnologizarii si a specializarii. Pentru BT, modernizarea agriculturii inseamna ca antreprenorii sa fie tot mai mult in zona de monitorizare a tehnologiei, iar utilajele si masinile sa fie cele care lucreaza. Efectul este, pe de o parte, productivitate mai mare, iar pe de alta parte, impact mai mic asupra mediului. In acest context, educatia in agribusiness si sustinerea spiritului antreprenorial sunt esentiale pentru cresterea afacerilor de familie. Cei 22 de cursanti care fac parte din programul Agro Intergeneration sunt membri ai unor familii care sunt clienti BT agribusiness, implicati in business-ul parintilor, din 16 judete. Programul incepe in aceasta saptamana si se deruleaza pe parcursul unui an universitar, pe module despre gestiunea fermei, management financiar, leadership, marketing, inovatie in agricultura etc. Cursurile sunt sustinute de profesori din cadrul USAMV Cluj-Napoca, de specialisti din diferite domenii si de persoane din echipa bancii. Sorin Ignat, Director Agribusiness, Banca Transilvania, a declarat că „Viitorul depinde de cum ne pregatim azi. De aceea, Agro Intergeneration este pentru noi mai mult decat un program, este o abordare noua pe care vrem sa o sadim in familiile romanesti cu afaceri in agricultura. Mai multe generatii in acelasi business inseamna familii mai unite, impartasirea experientelor si a bunelor practici, complementaritate. Pentru familie si comunitatile din care fac parte inseamna un model, un nume dus mai departe, competitivitate mai mare, prosperitatea noii generatii si locuri de munca”. Prof. dr. Cornel Catoi, Rector al USAMV Cluj-Napoca este de părere că: „Provocarile economice, sociale si de mediu necesita ca fermierii sa fie in centrul comunitatilor rurale ale Europei. Acest lucru explica motivul pentru care sprijinul pentru succesiunea generationala a fermelor si incurajarea unei noi generatii de fermieri este un element cheie pentru dezvoltarea agriculturii. In acest context, proiectul isi propune sa contribuie la perpetuarea fermelor familiale si la dezvoltarea unui plan de succesiune a fermelor care sa permita o tranzitie facila de la o generatie la alta, cu perturbari minime, atat a business-ului, cat si a relatiilor de familie. USAMV Cluj-Napoca poate contribui astfel la cresterea capitalului intelectual al managerilor de ferma – factor determinant in reusita succesiunii fermelor”. Migrarea fortei de munca in strainatate, interesul diminuat fata de activitatile agricole, imbatranirea populatiei, nevoia de sinergie si de profesionalizare pentru o abordare moderna a agriculturii sunt cateva dintre cauzele incertitudinii in ceea ce priveste succesiunea in agribusiness-urile de familie. Banca Transilvania se implica in sustinerea educatiei din domeniul agriculturii din 2013, prin burse acordate studentilor de la USAMV Cluj-Napoca, Bucuresti, Timisoara, Iasi, Constanta si Craiova. Cu peste 31.000 de clienti agribusiness, BT are aproape 18% din aceasta piata si este cel mai mare sustinator al agriculturii romanesti. Post- ul BT si USAMV Cluj-Napoca lanseaza programul Agro Intergeneration pentru agricultura moderna apare prima dată în Transilvania Regional Business.

DCR Nashville is providing an array of equipment for American singer- songwriter Halsey's 2018 touring schedule, including festivals and her continuing "Hopeless Fountain Kingdom World Tour." Gear includes Claypaky Mythos 2 and Scenius spots, grandMA2 consoles and MDG ATMe haze generators. All of the brands are exclusively distributed in North America by ACT Lighting, Inc.
 Halsey's "Hopeless Fountain Kingdom World Tour," in support of her second studio album of the same name, began last fall and will conclude this September. It is her second headlining concert tour.
 Production Designers Sooner Routhier and Robert Long of S Rae Productions designed the show, which makes extensive use of LED video. Large stairs have LED video on the risers, and a large LED wall upstage is comprised of two screens split at the center. Above the stage are five straight trusses with lighting, which mimic the stairs giving a very linear look to the overall design. Craig Rutherford is the lighting director.
 DCR Nashville has supplied the tour with 14 Claypaky Mythos 2 fixtures and 32 Scenius moving head spots. "The lights have been popular items in our inventory for some time and have also toured most recently with Brantley Gilbert and Chase Rice," said General Manager John Schirmer. "The Mythos 2 are rock solid, and Scenius always does a great job; everything has been fantastic on Halsey's tour."
 Jennifer Moore, DCR Nashville's VP of sales and the account executive for Halsey said, "At DCR we are about developing relationships through inspired solutions and experience. With Halsey we get to call on each of those components to provide our client with a show that her audience will remember for quite a while. Claypaky fixtures play a big part in that equation."
 Ten of the Mythos 2 are active fixtures mounted in the upstage truss, which rises above the LED stairs. A dozen Scenius spots are on the downstage truss and a dozen on the midstage truss. All of these lights provide SFX and beam lighting for the show.
 Two Scenius are offstage left and right in truss chairs with specially fabricated handles, and two more are positioned at FOH with the same custom handles. These four serve as traditional spots.
 A grandMA2 light is used for opening acts and as a spare system for Halsey. A grandMA2 full-size console with six NPUs controls lighting and the LED stairs. "We have a lot of multi-channel fixtures plus the LEDs on the stair rises so we needed the NPUs," said Schirmer. "We also have two grandMA network switches to manage the amount of data being passed between MA-Net and Art-Net to control the whole system."
 DCR also furnishes two MDG ATMe haze generators for the tour. "I love them, they're great units," said Schirmer. "Atmosphere is generated during the entirety of the show."

With the electorate so divided, and so many issues swirling, it's hard to imagine who might've been swayed by a hypothetical stimulus passed in time to reach people's pockets.

So that is a constituency that I think would've been affected by it. It goes hand in glove with the poor response to the COVID pandemic, which is hurting him among these constituencies. It's another thing that makes him look incapable of dealing with the crisis, either on a medical on an economic front. It may well have mattered for some number. It turns out that the election is not that close. If we were in 2016, and it was a matter of 75,000 voters in three states, it could've made a difference."

The late launch of new 5G phones caused Apple Inc's customers to put off buying new devices, leading the company on Thursday to report the steepest quarterly drop in iPhone sales in two years. Apple fell over 5 per cent at one point in after-hours trade, wiping $100 billion from its stock market value. Since 2013, Apple has delivered new iPhones each September like clockwork. But pandemic-induced delays pushed the announcement back a month, with some devices still yet to ship. Even as booming sales of Macs and AirPods boosted overall revenue and profit above what analysts had expected, iPhone sales dropped 20.7 per cent to $26.4 billion. Investors anticipated lower sales from the Cupertino, California company's bestselling product, but the hold-back was worse than expected, especially in China, where more consumers have access to 5G than in the United States or Europe. Apple has mostly beaten sales expectations this year and released a slew of new products and services that its customers have embraced while largely homebound during the pandemic. Apple said revenue and profits for the fiscal fourth quarter ended on Sept. 26 was $64.7 billion and 73 cents per share, compared with analyst estimates of $63.7 billion and 70 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. But the flagship iPhone 12's announcement was delayed until Oct. 13, several weeks later than usual, meaning no opening-weekend iPhone sales are included in the fourth-quarter results. In an interview with Reuters, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that he was optimistic about the iPhone 12 cycle based on the first five days of shipping data. 5G is a once-in-a-decade kind of opportunity. And we could not be more excited to hit the market exactly when we did, Cook said. At least in the U.S., the carriers are being very aggressive. The iPhone 12 release timing drove down sales in Greater China by 28.5 per cent to $7.95 billion. Cook said he expects the new 5G devices to help iPhone sales recover in China. What we're seeing in the early going in the first five days gives us a lot of confidence that China will return to growth in our fiscal Q1, Cook told Reuters. Apple did not provide a revenue growth forecast, but Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said revenue from services and non-iPhone products would grow by double-digit percentages in the fiscal first quarter, in line with analyst expectations. He said iPhone revenue would also grow, implying the rate would be in the single digits. Analysts expect iPhone revenue to rise 6.45 per cent to $59.56 billion in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Logan Purk, an analyst with Edward Jones, said that while iPhone sales will grow this cycle, it will be disappointing compared to elevated expectations, as we do not believe the 5G presents a compelling reason for a wave of upgrades. Apple has offset volatile iPhone sales in recent years with steady growth in its services segment, which includes streaming music and television. Services revenue rose 16.3 per cent to $14.5 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $14 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple One, a bundle of Apple's paid services, will launch on Friday. Cook told Reuters that Apple has 585 million paying subscribers across its platforms, up from 550 million the previous quarter and closer to the goal of 600 million subscribers that the company set out for the end of calendar 2020. Apple's shares have soared in the past two years as it has diversified its revenue streams to lessen its dependence on the iPhone. The share tumble on Thursday raises the question of whether Apple is still more dependent on iPhone sales than some investors had hoped. Apple needs to be able to keep the upgrade cycle going or the share price will wobble because there's no real room for forgiveness in the current valuation, said Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Apple said revenue from its accessories segment was up 20.8 per cent to $7.9 billion, compared with analyst estimates of a 13.5 per cent rise to $7.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Mac and iPad sales rose to $9.0 billion and $6.8 billion, compared with estimates of $7.92 billion and $6.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on parliament to dissolve the constitutional court, as hundreds of people gathered on Friday to protest a ruling to block a number of anti-corruption laws.
 Zelensky late Thursday submitted the bill called "renewing public confidence in constitutional justice", which would void the court's ruling to block much of the anti-corruption legislation and begin the process of selecting new judges.
 The constitutional court's move, prompted by a request from around 50 pro- Russian lawmakers, has sparked an outcry in Ukraine, with hundreds of people demonstrating outside the court in the capital Kiev on Friday.
 The protesters, including students and anti-corruption activists, held placards reading "Corrupted court of Ukraine" and "Out the pigs of the constitutional court".
 Iryna Shyba, a 28-year-old anti-corruption activist told AFP that without proper legal oversight, "most officials will steal with impunity, plunder the Ukrainian budget and Ukraine".
 Riot police on the scene did not intervene even after protesters threw smoke grenades into the court building.
 The head of the presidential administration Andriy Yermak claimed Friday in a meeting with G7 ambassadors that the court had been moved to drop the corruption measures as a result of "external influence," without further explaining.
 "The president will not stop on the path of reform and fight against corruption," he added.
 Constitutional court chairman Oleksandr Tupytsky responded to Zelensky's bill by saying it bore signs of a "constitutional coup".
 "The aim of all of this is to create a neutral, obedient court," he said during a news conference.
 \- 'Make or break' the presidency -
 "I am not accusing the president, but his entourage is doing a bad job," Tupytsky added.
 The constitutional court on Wednesday ruled that a number of anti-corruption laws were unconstitutional, including one on free public access to officials' asset declarations.
 Zelensky, a 42-year-old former comedian, came to power last year pledging sweeping political change and to root out corruption.
 On Thursday, he convened an emergency meeting of the National Security Council, saying the court's ruling was a "devastating" blow to the ex-Soviet country's anti-corruption reform drive. Lawmakers should undo the damage, he added.
 Zelensky -- weakened by losses in local elections last week -- may struggle to win support for his bill in parliament, said Timothy Ash, a senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management.
 "A major crisis is unfolding which could either make or break the Zelensky presidency," he said.
 Ukraine's ally the United States is distracted by its own upcoming presidential election and the crisis suits Moscow "just fine," Ash said.
 Russian President Vladimir Putin "will seek to exploit that to the full," he added.
 After a 2014 popular uprising, the West demanded tangible progress in Ukraine's fight against corruption, and Kiev established various anti- corruption bodies such as the National Agency for Preventing Corruption and the specialised court.
 The EU has warned that its visa-free regime for Ukraine could be suspended if Kiev does not do enough to combat corruption, considered by the bloc to be the country's top risk.
 According to Transparency International, Ukraine ranked 126th out of 198 countries on the watchdog's corruption perception index in 2019.

Bag & Baggage Productions (B&B) could write the book on flexibility. After all, the Hillsboro, OR-based theater company started touring the town in 2005 with nothing more than a van, mobile sets, and a handful of actors. By 2008, they had grown to become a popular fixture of the community and leased the historical converted Venetian Theater in the heart of the city’s Main Street. However, B&B required a new home when it was slated to be sold in 2016.
 Nimble as ever, the company set its sights on its own permanent residence and found a 5,000-square-foot bank building just two blocks away. B&B aptly named the new home The Vault, as a nod to the building’s history as well as a signifier of the company’s permanence in the city and within the theater scene.
 Unlike the Venetian--which was a large, 386-seat proscenium theater that was originally a movie theater--The Vault was built out as a small, black-box- style theater. This style is known for being simple. There’s no stage, just a flat floor and unadorned walls. Guests are situated around the four walls with the actors taking "the stage" in the middle of the floor. This change in setup was just one of the ways the company was reinventing itself.
 "We had been at the Venetian for eight years, so we had gotten used to doing things a certain way," said Jim Ricks-White, technical director for Bag & Baggage. "The Vault was a refreshing departure from that. When we started this process of looking for a new space, we started recalling our early years of operating out of a van. Everything had to be flexible. We wanted this space to reflect that humble beginning and not only function as theater but as a multipurpose event space that we could rent out to the community. To be that flexible, we had to be really selective of what technology we used and optimize the space for it."
 Technology has been the driving force for achieving that vision. Due to the size of the space, larger physical sets weren’t possible and something the company wanted to move away from anyway. Therefore, B&B decided to rely heavily on lighting and projection technology to set the scene, which, from a technology viewpoint, would make what was happening behind the scenes in the control booth just as important as what was happening on stage.
 With that in mind, the executive team at B&B and Opsis Architecture created a facility that could host any kind of event, from corporate meetings to wedding receptions and film festivals, and specified technology that would allow them to carry that off. That included a BenQ 4K BlueCore laser projector, eight Mitsubishi projectors, a full JBL surround sound system with Lutron control, a Da-Lite projection screen, and a Crestron controlled digital lighting rig in the theater and in the control booth all manner of behind the scenes support such as a video camera and monitor to visualize the theater from the booth, an audio mixer, a wireless video distribution system, a patch bay panel, and a control system.
 Because space was at a premium, B&B needed a rack that can handle many inputs while at the same time being incredibly accessible. Opsis Architecture selected Middle Atlantic Products SR Series Wall Mount Pivoting rack. Designed to address the need for space-saving solutions to house system distribution points, the SR Series’ innovative design allows the rack to be mounted on a wall and pivot open 90 degrees on a floor base to provide quick access to rear equipment connections without having to leaving room behind it. The rack also incorporates Middle Atlantic's built-in cable management and tool-free QuickMount system to integrate technology to best-practice standards.
 "Having the ability to control and plug and play all of the technology to the show or event specifications has afforded us an incredible amount of freedom," Ricks-White said. "Though we’re operating from a smaller space now compared to the Venetian, everything is right there in the rack--our camera input and monitor, all our HDMI connections, and our entire sound system. Access to the back of the rack has been incredibly useful in getting to our HDMI ports, which are in the back of the rack. For the first couple of shows, I was in the back of rack two or three times a show. Being able to swing open the rack and quickly plug into my next inputs was critical. It’s fast and simple."
 From a stage and technology management point of view, the consolidation of all that tech in one space has been a benefit for the crew, giving them something they didn’t have at the Venetian: better access and control of the technology. Previously, the sound booth and the lighting booth were in separate locations in the balcony. This required two operators for every show because if something went wrong in one place during a show, the other person couldn't get up and go fix it. Now everything is right where it’s needed.
 "For example, if I suddenly lose signal on something at the mixer, I literally take three steps, look at the rack, and see if I'm getting signal at the switcher," Ricks-White said. "There’s no digging around. It gives me three points that I can look at before I have to come down to the floor and figure out what's going on. It makes troubleshooting so much faster. It’s also key to our future as an organization. With everything we do, we keep asking ourselves how we, as a theater company, can move into the 22nd century. We will by staying flexible through technology and investing it in."
 To that end, The Vault was recently awarded a $50,000 technology grant to fund the purchase of the 4K projector. With the projector, the company has created a state-of-the-art digital projection laboratory that allows area artists, students, animators, innovators, and digital content producers to experiment with 4K technology. The projector also allows them to screen film festivals with 4K HD movies in the space as well as serve any presentation requirements for banquet, corporate, and event clients.
 "We’re already doing 4K projection mapping for scenes, and we’re going to keep pushing the technology envelope and evolving," Ricks-White said. "Our system will change down the road to naturally keep pace with what’s available. With a rack like this, we’re ready for that. It’s the brains of our operation."

As long as Miller remains a full-time student, he will retain his scholarship for this academic year.
 "Under NCAA guidelines, during the freshman year, UND must honor scholarship awards, unless there is serious misconduct during the period of the awards," a UND spokesperson said. "If a student-athlete withdraws from UND or is not enrolled full-time, it is no longer honored."
 Miller admitted to assault and violating the Ohio Safe Schools Act for wiping a candy push pop in a bathroom urinal and tricking a developmentally disabled Black boy, Isaiah Meyer-Crothers, into licking it. According to the police report, Miller had a pattern of using racist slurs toward Meyer-Crothers.
 In a letter Miller sent to NHL teams before the draft, he admitted to using racist language.
 After the in-depth story surfaced in the Arizona Republic, UND said it was aware of the 2016 incident and the program "made a decision that our program could provide him the necessary infrastructure and culture to hone not only his hockey abilities but most importantly, assist him in his continuing growth as a human being which will last him the remainder of his life."
 But Meyer-Crothers said it was not an isolated incident and it was a pattern. His mother wrote a letter to the Coyotes saying that Miller taunted her son just two years ago. That letter was published Wednesday by The Athletic.
 Miller released a statement through the Coyotes before they renounced their pick.
 "I am extremely sorry about the bullying incident that occurred in 2016 while I was in eighth grade," he said. "I was young, immature and feel terrible about my actions. At the time, I did not understand the gravity of my actions and how they can affect other people. I have issued an apology to the family for my behavior, completed cultural diversity and sensitivity training and volunteered within my community with organizations such as Little Miracles. Over the past four years, I have had a lot of time to reflect and grow and I am very grateful to the Arizona Coyotes for taking a chance on me. I promise not to let them down. Moving forward, I want to be a leader for this cause and help end bullying and racism."
 Upon renouncing their pick, Arizona's President and CEO Xavier Gutierrez said: "We have decided to renounce the rights to Mitchell Miller, effective immediately. Prior to selecting Mitchell in the NHL Draft, we were aware that a bullying incident took place in 2016. We do not condone this type of behavior but embraced this as a teachable moment to work with Mitchell to make him accountable for his actions and provide him with an opportunity to be a leader on anti-bullying and anti-racism efforts.
 "We have learned more about the entire matter, and more importantly, the impact it has had on Isaiah and the Meyer-Crothers family. What we learned does not align with the core values and vision for our organization and leads to our decision to renounce our draft rights. On behalf of the Arizona Coyotes ownership and our entire organization, I would like to apologize to Isaiah and the Meyer-Crothers family. We are building a model franchise on and off the ice and will do the right thing for Isaiah and the Meyer-Crothers family, our fans and our partners. Mr. Miller is now a free agent and can pursue his dream of becoming an NHL player elsewhere."

Ohio is building for the future, but they need some skilled hands to get the job done.
 Friday morning at the Real American Sunrise, people learned about the union construction industry. It has been going full speed even during the pandemic, since it is one of the few sectors that didn’t get shutdown. But the union builders are looking to keep that momentum going, and they need people to fill a variety of positions in their industry. That starts with apprenticeship programs to train people in plumbing, carpentry and over a dozen of other areas. To get those future laborers, union trade officials are trying to overcome the stereotype that you need to go to college to have a great career.
 “We are trying to show through the apprenticeship program and the union skilled building trades, you can have a great career with great fringe benefits, stay in your community, bring in the next generation, your kids, your grandkids with that,” says Mike Knisley, the executive secretary/treasurer The Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council. “At the end of the day, just like everybody else you have a great life with it. It’s been a good program. We are just trying to do everything that we can to get that message out.”

So could we see a second stimulus during the lame-duck session? "I kind of doubt it, but I'm not sure," says Way. "But the reason I doubt it is because the real reason we haven't had a [second] stimulus is the Republicans in the Senate. And they're deeply divided on this. And my understanding is that the calculation of a lot of the Republicans in the Senate who aren't up for reelection this year is looking ahead to the next election. They don't want to be on record supporting a big government program that expands welfare programs. These are policies that are, in the long run, anathema to Republican ideology and policies. And they don't want to be on the hook for supporting that. If that's their logic, it doesn't make a difference if it's three weeks before the election or three weeks after it. Because they're thinking two or four years down the line."

ATLANTA (AP) — Republicans again find themselves playing defense in Georgia's state House of Representatives, as Democrats try to leap to a majority in a chamber they haven't controlled since 2004. Democrats must capture a net of 16 seats to control the 180-seat House, overcoming the GOP's 105-75 majority. They gained a net of 11 seats in 2018 in Atlanta's suburbs when Stacey Abrams fell just short of capturing the governor's mansion for the Democrats, dragging the minority party back from the brink of irrelevancy in the General Assembly. “We are going to show Georgia Republicans once and for all that the Georgia Democratic Party is back, we’re better and we’re on our way to victory,” said Abrams, a possible 2022 gubernatorial candidate who has remained a party leader, during an online rally for House candidates earlier this month. Although Democrats also harbor hopes for gains in the 56-seat state Senate, it's unlikely the Democrats can gain enough seats to overturn the 35-21 Republican majority in the upper chamber. As many as 30 House districts have competitive races, although fewer than that are likely to change hands. House Republicans say they’re running on a record of achievement and warn Democrats will push higher taxes and more spending. “The other party, their plan is to take us in a completely opposite direction at high speed, which will necessarily involve tax increases,” said House Speaker David Ralston, a Blue Ridge Republican who'd likely win another term in the speaker's chair if his party retains control. Ralston is already the longest- serving House speaker since Tom Murphy's four-decade reign.

 _Miami_ – On the spur of the moment, a singer in a Cuban salsa band had an idea for a lyric to please fellow Trump supporters at a Miami birthday party.
 Tirso Luis Paez flicked his hand so his band mates would let him take over during a crowd favorite, “Cuba is Me,” and instead of singing the usual chorus, he belted out: “Yo voy a votar, por Donald Trump!”
 The seemingly spontaneous moment with Los 3 de la Habana was live-streamed and soon viewed by tens of thousands. The Trump campaign quickly featured it in a national ad projecting Miami Cuban enthusiasm for the Republican leader to Latino markets across the country. An English language version, “Oh my God I will vote, I will vote for Donald Trump,” spread online as well.
 Florida’s Cuban American voters remain a bright spot in Trump’s effort to retain his winning coalition from 2016. Polls show his strong support from these key voters may even be growing to include the younger Cuban Americans that Democrats once considered their best hope of breaking the GOP’s hold. For Trump, that support could prove essential in a tight race in a state he must win to beat Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
 In the past four years, Trump has courted with these voters by undoing former President Barack Obama’s Cuba engagement policy, sanctioning Latin-American socialist governments and misleadingly casting all Democrats as leftists and anti-capitalists.
 “Anything that smells like socialism to us, the slightest thing already makes us sick. We start shaking,” said Paez, who like many exiled Cubans accuses the island’s Communist leaders of oppressing its people and failing to lift them out of poverty.
 “Many people could identify with us in that video,” Paez said.
 Miami-Dade is where more than 40% of Cuban Americans live, and while the population includes more than 1.5 million Hispanics of voting age, they have an outsized influence over other Latino groups in the city.
 Caravans have become a common sight in Miami as Election Day approaches, with hundreds of cars in Hispanic neighborhoods blasting horns, blaring Latin music and cheering for Trump. They offer a stark contrast to pandemic gloom, often looking like victory parades, and the band has joined in, sharing a stage with Ivanka Trump and a boat ride with Eric Trump. Their song has been kept on a loop outside an early voting station in the Cuban American stronghold of Hialeah, where supporters waved American and Blue Lives Matter flags alongside a cardboard cutout of the president.
 Democrats had been banking on younger Cuban Americans to be more open to warming ties with the island, even if older exiles remain staunchly opposed. Obama’s appeal to young voters helped him carry Florida in both 2008 and 2012.
 Four years later, Democrat Hillary Clinton found some support among Cuban Americans put off by Trump’s unpredictable style, especially after he thwarted Cuban American Sen. Marco Rubio in the GOP primary. She won Miami-Dade County by 30 percentage points. Still, she narrowly lost the state to Trump.
 A Florida International University poll of Cuban Americans in Miami-Dade County released this month shows Trump leading Biden 59% to 25%. The same poll showed Trump leading among young Cubans, unlike in 2016, and the GOP gaining three out of four new arrivals from the island between 2010 and 2015 who registered to vote.
 Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, has released ads featuring a prominent exiled Cuban author saying Trump styles himself after Benito Mussolini and Augusto Pinochet. Another ad, by The Lincoln Project of anti- Trump Republicans, accuses him of acting like a dictator and says “Trump is just English for Castro.”
 And on Thursday, while both Biden and Trump were campaigning in Florida, the former vice president attacked the Trump administration for increasingly denying asylum to people fleeing dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. Biden said that if Trump had been president when generations of Cubans first came to the U.S. fleeing Fidel Castro, “in the old days, they wouldn’t be here.”
 Guillermo Grenier, who leads the FIU Cuba Poll, argues that these efforts may be too late, after the Biden campaign seemed to have given up on Cuban Americans, courting Florida’s Puerto Rican and Black voters instead.
 “There is no Democratic plan or beachhead to swing Cubans over to the Democratic side,” Grenier said.
 Biden is backed by Puerto Rican artists such as Bad Bunny and Luis Fonsi, while younger Cubans follow Trump’s social media celebrities, such as YouTube personality Alex Otaola and popular comedian Roberto San Martin.
 Trump’s criticism of Black Lives Matter protests that have sometimes sparked vandalism and violence resonates in Miami, where many Cubans said they were triggered by hammer-and-sickle graffiti sprayed on a city monument during protests in June over George Floyd’s death.
 When Miami public schools proposed increasing anti-racism teaching over the summer, the district was swamped with hundreds of calls, many from Cuban Americans concerned about “indoctrinating” children with strains of Marxist thought. A Cuban exile compared violent demonstrators to Nazis in an ad published by The Miami Herald.
 Edgard Lopez, a 43-year-old voter who arrived in Miami as a Cuban refugee a decade ago, said he opposes Biden’s call for more “community-oriented” policing.
 “We come to this country seeking law and order. In our country that does not exist, and that is now under threat,” said Lopez, who said he was harassed in Cuba for his work as a member of the opposition.
 Lopez said Trump’s blunt style is popular among Cuban Americans and he praises Trump’s economic record, saying he’s been better off under this administration working as a chef.
 Democrats warn that Trump’s efforts to overturn Obama’s health care law could hurt Cuban Americans in particular, since Miami-Dade County has the nation’s highest number of people enrolled in its health plans.
 “Many Cuban voters are the greatest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act, and they are voting to destroy and eliminate it,” said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster.
 The musicians of Los 3 de la Habana say Trump’s economic and foreign policies have been his main achievements. Ana Pinelli Paez, Tirso’s mother and fellow band member, remembers when they survived on only red beans, plantains and bread before leaving Cuba in 2007. She likes that Trump focuses on regular people, she said, “and he prioritizes Americans.”

If I could paraphrase some lyrics from the musical Chicago it would be "Come on, why don't we paint the garden, with all those Jazz." That is what I feel every time I see Jazz Hands Variegated loropetalum. This award-winning shrub simply puts a song in your spirit and will add that artist's touch to the garden.
 The first time I saw Jazz Hands Variegated without knowing what it was, I thought that it was a beautiful new snowbush. Snowbush, known botanically as Breynia disticha, is native to the Western Pacific Islands and tropical hardy to zones 10-11. If you are a tropical plant nut you know the plant, you've probably grown it and labored to protect it during the winter months.
 Imagine when I discovered, instead, that this was a loropetalum or Chinese fringe-flower cold hardy to zone 7. The same Loropetalum chinense we have all been planting for years, but with colorfully variegated new growth that is white and pink with mature growth purple, and yes, sporting hot pink flowers. It will get 4 to 6 feet tall with a 4-foot spread.
 That size may just speak volumes to you if you have been growing loropetalums for any length of time. You see right now in late October I have one blooming that is 20 feet tall. Now I will say it is stretching for sunlight a little. Everywhere I go however, I find gardeners who planted varieties of the first loropetalums as little shrubs by the front door and they reached redbud stature.
 The Jazz Hands series of loropetalums from Proven Winners features six selections that let you choose the color and size to perfectly fit the location. Jazz Hands Mini for instance is great for planting by the front door, placing in a small container or growing in the front of the border. It only reaches 12 inches tall with a 36-inch spread. It is evergreen or should we say ever purple with purple flowers.
 Slightly taller is Jazz Hands Dwarf that reaches 36 inches tall with an equal spread. This variety is among the industry leaders for those loropetalums with a smaller habit. But if you want to go big and bold then Jazz Hands Bold is nothing short of stunning.
 This loropetalum sports dark purple evergreen foliage that is larger slightly round and flowers that are the largest in the green industry. It is indeed bold, reaching 6 feet tall and as wide. While this is large it is still a most manageable size to incorporate in the landscape.
 The Jazz Hands series also has two white flowered varieties. Jazz Hands Night Moves reaches 4 feet tall and wide and might be considered architectural in that it sports new growth that is a variegated white dark green and purple with pure white blooms. If you haven't found a white you like, then Jazz Hands Mini is for you; it has dark green leaves and pristine white blooms while reaching 3-feet tall and as wide.
 All of these are cold-hardy from zones 7-10, meaning they can take 0 to 5 degrees. Those of you plagued by deer will be delighted to know these are not on the menu. No matter what loropetalum you choose, they perform best in full sun to part shade. In the Deep South a little afternoon shade is even better for creating a lush look and maintaining those incredible colors of Jazz Hands Variegated.
 Plant them in well-drained, organic-rich beds that are slightly acidic. I like to emphasize the part about planting in beds. When planting loropetalums, or any other shrub, put them in a well-prepared bed instead of sticking them in a patch of turf. Like we suggest with azaleas, plant them high, 1 to 2-inches above the soil surface and by all means finish the job with an application of mulch.
 Fall is an ideal time to plant loropetalums as their roots will get acclimated in the soil even as temperatures start to cool. Consider partnerships in the landscape with dogwoods and informal drifts of daffodils. Obviously, they would be great in informal clusters with white, lavender or pink Bloom-a-Thon azaleas. You are the artist: Come on and paint the garden with all those Jazz.

Hand made another All-Star Team in Cleveland and continued to be one of the 10 or so best closers in baseball right through this season. His underlying metrics suggest some decline, but he remains a very good and very valuable player at 31. He’s good because he still limits hard contact and strikes batters out in high-leverage innings, and valuable because even that $10 million salary is very competitive for a pitcher who can do those things. Cleveland could have kept Hand to close ahead of rising relief stars James Karinchak and Emmanuel Clase, or they could have done what the Padres did two years ago and dealt him to a team that was interested enough in acquiring a proven closer at a limited financial commitment to send a prospect the other way. Either would work, but one thing that a team would _not_ do with a player like Brad Hand would be to simply let him walk for nothing but the right not to pay the minimal buyout in his contract. Which you have probably guessed by now is precisely what the Indians did on Thursday afternoon.

 # Netflix raising U.S. streaming prices amid booming growth
 Michael Liedtke
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _San Ramon, Calif._ – Netflix is raising most of its U.S. prices by 8% to 13% as its video streaming service rides a wave of rising popularity spurred by government-imposed lockdowns that corralled people at home during the fight against the pandemic.
 The increases imposed Friday boost the cost of Netflix’s most popular U.S. streaming plan by $1 to $14 per month while a premium plan that allows more people to watch the service on different screens simultaneously will now cost $2 more at $18 per month. Netflix’s basic U.S. plan remains at $9 per month. It marks Netflix’s first price changes in the U.S. since an increase rolled out early last year.
 New U.S. subscribers will be charged the higher prices immediately while the increases will affect existing customers in phases during the next few months. Netflix ended September with 73 million subscribers in U.S. and Canada, with the overwhelming majority located in the U.S.
 The move had been widely expected after Netflix raised its prices in Canada earlier this month and then ended free 30-month trials in the U.S.
 Netflix’s price hike comes amid a surge in worldwide growth as efforts to contain the novel coronavirus closed down restaurants, theaters and other entertainment venues. The Los Gatos, California, company gained 28 million worldwide subscribers during the first nine months of the year, already eclipsing its growth for the entire year of 2019. This year’s subscriber increases included an additional 5.4 million customers in the U.S. and Canada.
 But the price increases may test the bounds of Netflix’s popularity, especially if the pandemic-driven recession deepens and forces more U.S. households to curtail their spending.
 After Netflix raised its U.S. prices early last year, the streaming service suffered a decline of 130,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada between from the end of March to the end of June.
 Netflix is also facing more competition than ever, including deep-pocketed rivals that include Amazon, Apple, Walt Disney and AT&T.; And several of those are far less expensive than Netflix’s U.S. plan.
 For instance, Disney’s rapidly growing streaming service charges just $7 per month for access to a library that includes some of the most beloved films of all time. Apple’s year-old streaming service costs just $5 per month for a relatively small selection of TV series and films, but the iPhone maker is trying to extend its reach by pouring more money into programming and bundling with its some of its other services. For instance, a plan that includes video, music, video games and online storage is being offered for $15 per month, or just a $1 more than Netflix’s most popular stand-alone plan.
 “We understand people have more entertainment choices than ever and we’re committed to delivering an even better experience for our members,” Netflix said in a statement. “We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer more variety of TV shows and films.”
 The higher prices should help lift Netflix’s profits, a prospect that investors like. But Netflix’s stock fell more than 5% to $475.75 in Friday’s afternoon trading amid a broad market sell-off. Netflix’s shares have climbed by nearly 50% so far this year, thanks largely to its robust growth amid the pandemic.

But by June, as the Nats were nearing the end of their now-infamous and injury-plagued 19-31 start, I was root root rooting as hard for the home team as my boys. Perhaps the best sign of my being all-in: I even stopped mocking the gimmicky “Baby Shark” routines. We watched, attended, listened to or otherwise paid as close attention to every single game as geography, technology, and odd broadcasting contracts allowed, and did it together. (I haven’t yet taught my kids that pirating streams is bad.) As the Nats crawled out of the NL East cellar, we learned to loathe the team’s days off. I hadn’t clung to a team this tightly since the 1982 Baltimore Orioles, led by young Cal Ripken and Eddie Murray and old Jim Palmer, lost the division title and a playoff berth with one loss to the Milwaukee Brewers on the last day of the season.

A day after warning a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic is now gripping New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy stressed Friday “all options are on the table” to fight the growing spread — “even draconian ones" like another round of statewide stay-at-home orders and business closings.
 He specifically warned that indoor dining could be shut down “if we were to take a step back.”
 Still, Murphy said he’s hopeful he won’t have to issue another statewide order to close schools. And he continued to express optimism the state can bring the outbreak under control using more localized and less heavy-handed restrictions, even as the weather gets colder and the holiday season approaches.
 “Everything’s on the table, but I hope the chances of that are still low,” the governor said after an unrelated event at Rutgers University in Piscataway when asked by NJ Advance Media what the chances are he’ll order residents to stay home and nonessential businesses to close, like he did in March when the first wave of the virus engulfed New Jersey.
 Murphy’s message was the most uncertain it’s been in a while as New Jersey on Friday reported 2,089 more COVID-19 cases — the first time since early May the state has announced more than 2,000 positive tests in one day. In recent weeks, Murphy had been reticent to speculate about new restrictions, saying late last month he didn’t expect another shutdown.
 But officials have also warned that hospitalizations and spot positivity are rising in the state and deaths are likely to follow suit, though numbers right now remain far below the state’s April peak.
 “These are big numbers, there’s no question about that,” Murphy said told reporters Friday.
 The Covid Tracking Strategy, a group of health and crisis experts that monitors the spread in each U.S. state, now rates New Jersey’s spread as “uncontrolled.”
 Murphy disagreed with that view.
 “I hope they’re wrong,” he said. “I don’t think it’s uncontrollable. … I don’t view it that way. I believe strongly that if we wear these (masks) and stay as far away as you and I are right now … I think if we do the basic stuff, we’ll be able to still crack the back of this. But my level of concern is high.”

K. Todd Swisher, Circuit Court clerk for the city of Lynchburg, provided The Associated Press with a copy of the complaint, which contains a limited number of redactions in sections pertaining to Falwell's employment agreement. Swisher said there would be a hearing within a week for a judge to consider whether an unredacted version of the complaint should remain sealed.
 Liberty spokesman Scott Lamb said the school, which had not yet been served with the lawsuit, would have a formal statement in response later Thursday. The school's board of trustees has been meeting this week.
 An attorney for Falwell did not respond immediately to a telephone message left Thursday, and Falwell did not respond to a voicemail and text seeking comment.
 Falwell left Liberty in August after Giancarlo Granda, a younger business partner of the Falwell family, said he had a yearslong sexual relationship with Falwell's wife, Becki Falwell, and that Jerry Falwell participated in some of the liaisons as a voyeur.
 Although the Falwells have acknowledged that Granda and Becki Falwell had an affair, Jerry Falwell has denied any participation. The couple allege that Granda sought to extort them by threatening to reveal the relationship unless he was paid substantial amounts of money.
 Before his resignation, Falwell had already been on an indefinite leave of absence after an uproar over a photo he posted on social media of him and his wife's pregnant assistant, both with their pants unzipped.
 Falwell said it was taken in good fun at a costume party during a vacation, but critics saw it as evidence of hypocrisy by the head of an institution that holds students to a strict moral code of conduct.
 Shortly after Falwell's departure, Liberty announced it was opening an independent investigation into his tenure as president, a wide-ranging inquiry that would include financial, real estate and legal matters.
 Earlier this month, the school identified Baker Tilly US as the firm handling the investigation and announced the launch of a website to "facilitate the reporting of potential misconduct to the investigative team."
 Falwell has declined to answer questions from the AP about the size of the exit package he received from the university but has discussed the issue with other news organizations, which reported that he was set to receive $10.5 million. However, Liberty said in a statement last month that it paid Falwell two years of base salary and disputed "media reports regarding the size and terms" of Falwell's contract.
 In an August interview with the AP, Falwell said that the school's board had been "very generous to me" but raised concerns that they were "being influenced by people who really shouldn't have a say" about the future direction of Liberty.
 In the lawsuit, Falwell claimed that Liberty "turned on" him after Granda went public with his allegations, forcing his resignation. The lawsuit also says Liberty rejected Falwell's attempts "to reach an amicable resolution," forcing Falwell to turn to court to "restore his reputation."
 The lawsuit says Liberty's statements have harmed not only Falwell's reputation but also his future employment prospects and business opportunities. Falwell now has a "drastically reduced ability" to attach his name to business and charity organizations, and he has stopped receiving previously frequent invitations to appear on TV to discuss Liberty, evangelicalism and politics, the lawsuit says.
 Reached for comment on the lawsuit, Granda said via email that he stands by his previous statements.
 "Jerry is attempting to portray himself as a victim," Granda said. "No one should be fooled."
 The lawsuit further alleges that "Liberty's actions are antithetical to the teachings of Christ." Falwell's attorneys charge the university with hurting its own standing and that of the broader evangelical community "by playing right into the hands of sinister operatives with ulterior motives."
 Falwell's acrimonious departure from Liberty came four years after his endorsement helped burnish the reputation of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump among conservative evangelical Protestants. That group has since become a critical part of the president's political base. The public Falwell- Trump alliance that marked 2016 is not visible in this year's election, as the president looks to other prominent evangelical surrogates.
 Named in the lawsuit as amplifying Granda's claims is The Lincoln Project, a group founded by prominent GOP critics of Trump. A Lincoln Project adviser had provided public relations help to Granda after he went public with his allegations about a sexual relationship with Becki Falwell, although the group said Thursday that it "has had nothing to do with the public finally learning about the true character of the Falwell family."
 "The Lincoln Project didn't make Mr. Falwell unbutton his pants on a super yacht and post a picture on social media," and it "didn't make Mr. Falwell stand with Donald Trump, though that now makes sense; they are kindred spirits," the group said in a statement.

Novak Djokovic suffered his heaviest defeat in a three-set match on Friday when he was knocked out of the Vienna ATP tournament by lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego, stalling his bid to wrap up the year-end world number one ranking for a sixth time.
 Italian Sonego, ranked 42 and who had intially lost in qualifying last weekend, is the first lucky loser ever to beat Djokovic.
 His 6-2, 6-1 quarter-final stunner was 33-year-old Djokovic's heaviest ever defeat.
 The only other time he had won just three games was at the 2005 Australian Open at the hands of Marat Safin in a best-of-five set encounter.
 Friday's defeat means Djokovic will have to wait a little longer before he completes the formality of equalling Pete Sampras's all-time record of ending the season top of the rankings for a sixth time.
 "For sure it's the best victory of my life. Novak is the best in the world. Today I played so, so good," Sonego said.
 "It's unbelievable. It's amazing. I played the best match in my life. I'm so happy for this."
 Sonego fired 26 winners past the Serb who lost for only the third time in 2020.
 Djokovic, a 17-time major champion, managed just seven winners against 25 unforced errors.
 Second seed and defending champion Dominic Thiem also lost Friday, going down 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 to Russian world number eight Andrey Rublev.
 Rublev hit 30 winners past the US Open champion and goes on to face South Africa's Kevin Anderson for a place in the final.
 "I came here with the mood that I have nothing to lose," said Rublev who is chasing a fifth title of the year.
 "I had already a really great season. I came here with zero expectations, just wanting to do my best. To try to fight every match. At the end, I am here in the semi-finals."
 Anderson made the semi-finals by accounting for Russian fourth seed Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 7-6 (7/5).
 It was Anderson's first top 10 win in two years.

BOSTON (AP) — Authorities say “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin has reported to a federal prison in California to begin serving her two-month sentence for her role in the college admissions bribery scandal.The U.S. Attorney’s office in Boston said Friday that Loughlin was being processed at the federal lockup in Dublin, California.“The parties recently agreed that the defendant can report to prison on October 30, 2020, instead of on November 19, 2020. The defendant has further agreed that, during her two month sentence, she will not seek an early release from prison on COVID-related grounds,” prosecutor said in a statement.Under the Bureau of Prisons' coronavirus protocols, Loughlin will be screened and tested for COVID-19 and will be placed in quarantine for 14 days.The low-security prison in Northern California houses 874 inmates and had two positive coronavirus cases among inmates, as of Friday morning, federal statistics show.In August,&nbsp;Loughlin was sentenced to two months and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, got five months&nbsp;for paying half a million dollars in bribes to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as rowing recruits.Prosecutors said Giannulli didn’t report to prison with Loughlin on Friday.Plea deals worked out with the celebrity couple call for Loughlin to pay a $150,000 fine and perform 100 hours of community service, and Giannulli to pay a $250,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service.The famous couple’s sentencing came three months after they reversed course and admitted to participating in the college admissions cheating scheme that has laid bare the lengths to which some wealthy parents will go to get their kids into elite universities.They are among nearly 30 prominent parents to plead guilty in the case, which federal prosecutors dubbed “Operation Varsity Blues.” It uncovered hefty bribes to get undeserving kids into college with rigged test scores or fake athletic credentials.Loughlin and Giannulli had insisted for more than a year that they believed their payments were “legitimate donations” and accused prosecutors of hiding crucial evidence that could prove the couple’s innocence because it would undermine their case.The case shattered the clean image of Loughlin, who gained fame for her role as the wholesome Aunt Becky in the sitcom “Full House” that ran from the late 1980s to mid-1990s, and later became queen of the Hallmark channel with her holiday movies and the series “When Calls the Heart.”Prosecutors said Giannulli deserved a tougher sentence because he was “the more active participant in the scheme,” while Loughlin “took a less active role, but was nonetheless fully complicit.”The couple funneled money through a sham charity operated by Rick Singer — the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme — to get their two daughters into USC as crew recruits, even though neither was a rower, authorities said. Singer, who has also pleaded guilty, was expected to testify against them if they had gone to trial.Investigators had recorded phone calls and emails showing the couple worked with Singer to get their daughters into USC with fake athletic profiles depicting them as star rowers. In one email, Singer told Loughlin and Giannulli he needed a picture of their older daughter on a rowing machine in workout clothes “like a real athlete.”Prosecutors said the couple allowed the girls “to become complicit in crime,” instructing them to pose on rowing machines for photos and warning their younger daughter not too say too much to her high school counselor to avoid getting caught.Among the other high-profile parents who have been sent to prison for participating in the scam is “Desperate Housewives” actress Felicity Huffman. She served nearly two weeks behind bars late last year in the same California prison after she admitted to paying $15,000 to have someone correct her daughter’s entrance exam answers.___Balsamo reported from Washington.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

It’s not inconceivable that the Seahawks, Cardinals, Rams and 49ers all could find their way into the NFC playoffs with a third wild card added. It’s unlikely not because they might be unworthy, but because they could be knocking off each other during intradivision play. So far, only three games have been played within the NFC West: Arizona beating San Francisco and Seattle,  and the Niners defeating the Rams.
 “Yeah, we’re in the best division in football and, you know, there’s a reason for it,” Rams quarterback Jared Goff said after the loss to the 49ers. “These guys are good. Arizona’s good. Seattle’s obviously undefeated (then). We’re a great team. So every time you play in this division, it’s going to be a tough game, and we know that coming in.”
 What the four clubs also know, coming in and going out, is they could be battered by the time they get to January. Fully tested by the trials and tribulations of the division, for sure. But perhaps not in the best shape for a Super Bowl run.
 “Obviously, everybody has winning records in our division and everybody’s doing really good, and some people might say we have the best division,” said Tyler Lockett, the Seahawks’ outstanding wide receiver. “But at the end of the day, who cares? We still got to be able to take care of business and those divisional games might end up being key.”

Mark generally did not enjoy meeting new people, and would’ve preferred to stay in the car, except that he would’ve seemed childish and that ultimately would’ve been more awkward than anything inside the house. After introductions and a few bearable minutes of chit-chat, Mark mumbled a pretext for excusing himself to the backyard, and wandered outside for a big gulp of fresh air and some alone time. The yard was perhaps two acres and sloped down a gentle hill to a thin strip of woods and a muddy trickle of a creek which marked the property line.

When you know a tiny bit about something, you can walk around in a fog that throws your finances for a total loop.
 And so begins the story on coronavirus relief efforts and student loan debt.
 Increasingly, consumer advocates report hearing from student loan borrowers who haven't paid a dime on their college loans since March and believe that they're in perfectly fine shape. They've heard about all the student loan breaks that now run through the end of December.
 And the big money trip wire?
 Tucked in their basket of debt, they're dealing with a hot mess of student loans that aren't covered by coronavirus-related debt relief.
 A metro Detroit consumer was shocked after late payments relating to unpaid student debt suddenly popped up in 2020 on her credit report, according to Sue Stoddard, housing counselor and family self-sufficiency resource coordinator for the Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency.
 Stoddard, a financial coach for the borrower, had to explain that more than $13,000 of student loan debt was now being reported as past due _ indicating that those specific loans weren't covered by special forbearance programs.
 The borrower had needed to make monthly payments on those loans but had stopped because of some misconceptions about what was and what wasn't covered under COVID-19 debt relief.
 The borrower didn't realize that the temporary 0% rates and automatic pause in payments applied only to specific federal student loan debt, not all student loans.
 About 9 million borrowers _ those with private student loans and those with most Perkins loans and Federal Family Education Loans that are not owned by the federal government _ are not receiving automatic relief, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.
 "With private student loans, a borrower has to request forbearance. It is not automatic. Even the special 90-day COVID-19 forbearance has to be requested," said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of research for Savingforcollege.com.
 And many experts recommend that you contact your loan servicer, if you're having trouble making your payments or if you're unclear about whether your loans are covered under the federal CARES Act or other programs.
 Mishaps can trigger trouble down the road _ and servicers will try to get their money. For example, a private student loan creditor is entitled to 100% of your state tax refund, with court approval.
 For private student loans, tax refund garnishment is only available at the state level and does not apply to federal tax refunds.
 "While they can't seize your federal refund, they can take action to collect quicker than federal student loan servicers," Stoddard said.
 "Federal servicers are unable to take collection action until a loan is 270 days past due, private servicers can take action as soon as you're late once."
 The private servicer can go to court and sue to garnish wages, seize money in your bank account and take your state tax refund, according to student loan experts.
 "Lawsuits are the main collection tool for delinquent private student loans," Stoddard said.
 If you have federal student loans in default, your federal income tax refund can be offset to cover the debt. (For information about offsets, you can call the U.S. Treasury offset program call center at 800-304-3107.)
 Having delinquent student debt or debt in default will damage your credit score _ and drive up the interest rates you'd pay if you're taking out a car loan or a mortgage.
 Federal collections on defaulted federal student loans also have been suspended through the end of the year. Remember, though, these loans are deferred and not forgiven. People need to craft a plan to begin repaying their debt in 2021.
 And why must your student loan be paid?
 If you're confused, well, that's just part of waking up every day in 2020, isn't it?
 "We did see that many borrowers were confused about which loans qualified and which did not," said Will Sealy, co-founder and chief executive of Summer, which helps student-loan borrowers track their loans and identify the best repayment options.
 Sealy noted that some servicers voluntarily gave borrowers with commercially held FFEL loans a 90-day forbearance where the interest still accrued. While helpful, the break often perplexed borrowers because 0% interest relief was offered on other federal student loans covered under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
 Some borrowers are opting to consolidate some older FFEL not covered in order to get relief under the COVID-19 forbearance policy. But that isn't wise for everyone because some protections are lost by consolidating.
 "Any borrower who is unable to make their loan payments on the commercially held federal loans may consider enrolling their loan in an Income-Driven Repayment plan. If they're currently earning less than $20,000, the borrower will likely qualify for a monthly payment of $0," Sealy said.
 Summer has an online tool that all borrowers can access to determine which federal loans qualify for the CARES Act and which do not. See www.meetsummer.org/covidrelief.
 Wayne Metro offers a Student Loan Webinar monthly that is free to attend. For more information go to www.waynemetro.org.
 What should student loan borrowers do?
 The first step to spotting trouble is simply to request a free copy of your credit report at www.annualcreditreport.com to see if any student loans are showing late payments. Free weekly online reports are being offered through April 2021.
 You might see those unpaid loans show up as past due, delinquent, or they may be listed in collections. Review the credit reports for Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.
 You would not see late payments for federal student debt that is covered by COVID-19 relief. Federal student loan account status would show as current or pays-as-agreed.
 "If you do not make payments on your private student loans for 120 days and are not in an authorized forbearance, your loans will go into default," Kantrowitz said.
 Anecdotally, Kantrowitz said, he's heard of a few private student loan lenders that may be automatically putting borrowers who have not made payments since March into a forbearance program, rather than have their private student loans go into default.
 You are at the mercy of your lender here but it's wise to reach out now, even if you're behind because you didn't understand the rules.
 Unfortunately, borrowers cannot tap into a central database to locate private student loan debt. But one can go to studentaid.gov to access information about federal loans.
 Kantrowitz suggests that borrowers contact the financial aid office of the college you attended, as the school may have information about your private student loans.
 Many times, students sign the paperwork that's in front of them when they're taking out loans in college and they don't realize that all student loans aren't the same. Such distinctions, though, are essential to understand in 2020 where nothing is all that simple.

You can also use the Drop In feature on the speaker to let trick-or-treaters know from a safe distance that you enjoy their costume or how much candy to take. Note that it may be best to set out small bags of candy to avoid dozens of hands touching each piece.

WILLCOX — Tombstone soiled Willcox's last volleyball of the season Thursday night, winning 3-0 to finish 2-8 and avoid finishing last in region, leaving that spot for Willcox, who are 1-9.
 “You can’t soften the blow of this loss,” Willcox head coach Todd Debaun said. “The difference between a great season and this season is that we competed in one game, the Benson victory, and we just showed up in all of the others.”
 The Yellow Jackets won 25-16 and 25-19 before escaping with a 26-24 final game victory to get the sweep.

Just as coming to terms with the loss of a loved one is a painful but eventually necessary experience, so--many of the longest-tenured users of /r/collapse believe--it is necessary for large numbers of people to come to terms with the idea that they may experience civilizational collapse in their lifetimes. But in some ways, doomscrolling is a barrier to achieving this goal: users might find it easier to come to terms with these ideas if they were not paralyzed by algorithms constantly serving up more doom. And the more people who find the subreddit, the worse the risk of doomscrolling becomes. "The subreddit is going to continue growing as systemic disruptions occur," says Rezl, the moderator. "So we have to figure out a way, at any scale, to address that. But there's no ultimate solution. You can't have a million people in a room all talking at once."

Integrated Systems Events, the producers of the Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) exhibition, has announced that its 2021 edition will be held at Gran Via, part of the Fira de Barcelona exhibition complex in Spain on February 2-5.
 The new venue will become the permanent location for the world’s largest AV and systems integration show.
 The decision to relocate the ISE exhibition comes after 18 months of research into the viability of remaining at the RAI Amsterdam. With annual growth in ISE exhibitors and attendees approaching 10 percent, and the international AV market forecast to grow by 5 percent per annum through to 2021, it was concluded that ISE was outgrowing its popular Amsterdam location.
 The Fira de Barcelona has two exhibition venues and hosts 140 international trade shows each year, featuring more than 30,000 exhibitors and attracting over two million attendees.
 ISE 2018 attracted 80,923 attendees, of which 22,000 were visiting the show for the first time while 1,296 exhibitors filled 53,000 net sqm of floor space in 15 halls. ISE 2019 is expected to increase on these record breaking figures.
 "The RAI and Amsterdam have provided a fantastic location, been great partners, and contributed to the success of the show," said Mike Blackman, managing director Integrated Systems Events. "But, demand from exhibitors, and the continued increase in the numbers of attendees, showed us that limited floor space was in danger of putting a brake on the show’s development. In spite of all our best efforts this was not an issue we felt could be solved by staying at the RAI Amsterdam."
 "We conducted extensive exhibitor and attendee research and visited many major exhibition centers in Europe before making this important decision. By announcing our move to one of Europe’s largest and most prestigious convention complexes, we can now continue to focus on creating a unique experience for everyone and confidently plan for long-term development. At the same time, we will ensure that the remaining two editions of ISE at the RAI Amsterdam are the best in its illustrious history and a fitting way to bring our 14-year relationship with the venue and city to a close."
 The Fira de Barcelona is one of Europe’s most prestigious convention and conference locations. The complex has two exhibition venues and hosts 140 international trade shows each year, featuring more than 30,000 exhibitors and attracting over two million attendees. In total, it has over 400,000 square meters of floor space and 14 halls.
 Gran Via is one of Europe’s largest and most modern exhibition venues. It blends outstanding architecture with exceptional functionality across eight halls and 200,000 square meters of exhibition floor space. It also offers unparalleled visitor flow and state-of-the art services and logistics. It is conveniently placed for access to the nearby international airport and public transport.
 ISE’s co-owners AVIXA and CEDIA are keen to highlight the positive benefits of the decision to relocate.
 "Our thinking in coming to this decision has been driven by our desire to serve and deliver value for our members, attendees, and exhibitors at ISE," said David Labuskes, AVIXA CEO. "We can better achieve these objectives in a venue that can evolve with us and continue to reflect the market we work in. The continued success of ISE and the growth anticipated in the AV business meant that we knew this decision would need to be taken before too long. I’m delighted that we were able make that decision now so as to control events and to ensure that a smooth transition is possible."
 Tabatha O’Connor, CEDIA global president and CEO, commented: "Not only is the new venue a state of the art home for our show but the city of Barcelona is one of Europe’s most vibrant and exciting. It’s the perfect choice for an exhibition and growing industry that engenders creativity and commerce."
 Fira is one of the Europe’s leading trade fair organizations and is closely linked to the Barcelona brand, a city with over a century of trade fair tradition. Its annual economic contribution to the city of Barcelona and its surroundings is estimated at more than €2,600 million. Fira is a consortium comprising the Barcelona City Council, the Catalan Generalitat and the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, which combines public ownership with autonomous company management.
 Both, the ISE 2019 and 2020 editions will take place at the RAI Amsterdam and are forecast to be the largest and most successful in the show’s 16-year history.

That was wing night at the tavern. We’d overeat delicious and discounted wings and drink too many Diet Cokes, even on school nights, while cheering the Nats back into playoff contention alongside a bar crowd that grew as the season progressed and the wins piled up. Take away the odd rainout, and there’s always a game on Wednesday. The servers and bartenders, god bless ‘em, never made us feel like the bar-killing, teetotaling bargain hunters that we were.

One will have to be a little bit patient in IT and pharma but for longer term investment we still like these sectors though one has to choose the stocks carefully, says Pratik Gupta, CEO& Co-Head, Institutional Equities, Kotak Securities. Markets are on tenterhooks with the US elections next week and the uncertainty about outcomes. Adding further uncertainty is the rising caseloads of coronavirus and renewed lockdowns in Europe. How are you viewing the situation currently? The near term outlook is clouded by the risk of a virus resurgence in Europe and its effect on the global economy. A bigger event in our view is the US elections. There is the equivalent of a hung parliament over there with a lack of a clear verdict and that would delay policy making. In India, we have seen virus cases coming down but there is always a risk of a second wave and we could have another round of localised lockdowns which could disrupt supply chains and demand and so on. But the bigger picture is that if you sit back and look beyond the next few weeks or months, the overall global situation does not really change. Central banks around the world are printing money. The Fed for example has expanded its balance sheet to more than $7 trillion this year and is on track to expand it even further, irrespective of who comes into the US White House. The ECB yesterday announced that they will be doing another stimulus. They think the economy needs further easing measures and in the US, irrespective of which government comes in, there will be a fiscal stimulus package of roughly $2 trillion. Depending on Democrats or the Republicans, the number could change a little bit but by and large they are both aligned on one aspect, which is that the US economy needs more fiscal stimulus. In turn that should lead to a weaker US dollar which tends to result in more positive flows to emerging market assets and emerging market equities in particular. In that context, India should also benefit. So, if you ignore the short-term noise, the longer- term outlook is perhaps not as pessimistic as many are making it out to be. The key risk is the virus over here in India and hopefully we will continue the pace of recovery going forward. What is your sense on the flows? We saw a dip and a climb back. What do you see going forward?The global flows are impacted by risk appetite and sentiment and obviously the underlying flows into their own asset classes. In India a lot of the money comes in from EM funds of the FIIs. There are obviously some global funds which invest directly as well and then there is the Indian dedicated asset category. So far we are not seeing any big India dedicated inflows as yet, but a lot could change after the US elections. If there is a lot of liquidity and a lot of positive sentiment towards EMs, then some asset allocators based will try and find individual countries to invest in rather than invest in the overall EM basket. But in general, in our discussions with our global clients, we are hearing of strong enquiries about EM funds. This has happened more in the last few weeks and more so after Powell’s commentary last month wherein he effectively indicated that low interest rates will continue for much longer. So, if you have a reasonably stable political environment in the US and the fiscal stimulus package proceeds, the flows into the EMs would include India as well and that should pick up. Keep in mind that India has actually underperformed the emerging market index this year. That is another reason why despite somewhat weakish growth outlook, we are still reasonably attractive although we are no longer the hot favourites. Markets never react to the same event twice in the same fashion. Post this correction, is it going to be as straight line and one way up recovery as it was from the March lows?Would again IT and pharma emerge as leaders?It is very difficult to imagine that same kind of straight line curve up even in a very bullish global environment. In March, the Nifty plunged to 8,000 and now we have come back to almost 12,000 -- an almost 50% rally. It is highly unlikely that we will see that kind of a rally once again even in the very bullish global economic and monetary environment. But clearly, while IT and pharma have rallied and a bit of a consolidation is taking place which will continue going forward as well, valuations have become somewhat full. Also, there has been a fundamental change in their earnings growth outlook for the next couple of years. In IT, we have seen margins expand even though the current September quarter margins are unlikely to persist. But by and large, we expect the margin trajectory to be much better for FY22, FY23, given the cost cutting and offshoring angle we are seeing in IT and pharma. Likewise, the USFDA regime has become far more benign and the competitive intensity has come off. Companies are past the bulk of the peak of the capex cycle. We are seeing free cash flows improve and there are a lot of new products in the pipeline for a lot of the companies. The India pharma industry has a long way to go. One will have to be a little bit patient in IT and pharma but for longer term investment we still like these sectors though one has to choose the stocks carefully and keep valuations in mind. The sector rotation will happen but I do not think it will be a broad-based churn. Just one sector may move. There is banking for example. That is a sector we like but it is not a broad-based sector positive view. There will be a differentiation. Some of the larger private sector banks which have a very strong deposit franchise and whose underwriting risks are very good and management quality is very stable, should do quite well going forward, even in a somewhat weakish industry growth environment simply because of market share gains. As and when the economy recovers, the credit growth starts coming back, the banks which have raised capital and which have a solid balance sheet and which have already done with a bulk of the NPLs and provisioning, will come out looking quite good and may start surprising on NIMs and credit growth and operating profits and perhaps even on credit costs. But within banks also, you have to be careful. It is not going to be a broad-based across-the-board up move. It will be similar in NBFCs. While we prefer banks to NBFCs, there are a few NBFCs which are well capitalised and where the asset quality has not been so badly impacted. One can also look selectively at a few sectors where there are market share stories. So, it is not going to be just IT and pharma once again.

Minnesota’s secretary of state said Thursday it’s too late for voters to mail back their absentee ballots if they want to make sure their votes count, after an appeals court ruling indicated that mail-in ballots arriving after Election Day are at risk of being invalidated.
 A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that Minnesota absentee ballots arriving after Election Day should be separated from other ballots in case they are later invalidated by a final court order. The ruling doesn’t block Minnesota’s seven-day extension for counting absentee ballots outright, but puts the grace period in danger.
 “Voters should no longer place their absentee ballots in the mail,” Secretary of State Steve Simon said. “It is too late for you, practically speaking, to get it back. Don’t risk it.”
 The ruling doesn’t impact ballots received by the time polls close on Election Day, but sets the stage for post-election litigation. The case was sent back to a lower court for more proceedings.
 “What the court left unsettled was the question of whether, once and for all and finally, ballots will or won’t be counted if received after Tuesday, Nov. 3,” Simon said. “The decision, to be candid, is not a model of clarity and it leaves open a lot of unanswered questions.”
 The decision is likely to create voter confusion, with people who haven’t returned their absentee ballots scrambling to make sure their votes count. Simon said voters who still have absentee ballots in hand may drop them off at a designated location, vote early at an early voting station, or vote in person on Election Day. Those who already returned absentee ballots can track them online to see if they’ve been received.
 As of Thursday night, nearly 400,000 of some 2 million requested absentee ballots remained outstanding, Simon said.
 “The consequences of this order are not lost on us. We acknowledge and understand the concerns over voter confusion, election administration issues, and public confidence in the election,” the majority wrote. But they said those problems were preferable to a post-election scenario where invalidated and valid votes are mixed.
 “Better to put those voters on notice now while they still have at least some time to adjust their plans and cast their votes in an unquestionably lawful way,” the majority wrote.
 The ruling is a win for Republicans, who argued that the extension — which had been approved in both state and federal courts due to the COVID-19 pandemic — violated federal law that establishes Nov. 3 as the date of the 2020 election.

_(Garnet's Gold)._ In a mix of direct-to-camera interviews and chilling re- enactments, Walker describes his strategic decision to survive among violently racist neighbors and classmates by trying to "fit in" with them as much as possible. He bleaches his skin; he wears white fashions; he uses contact lenses to give himself those long-sought-after blue eyes. Lacking the means to stand tall against a tide of hate, Walker instead assimilates himself into it.

In trying to protect their son, Walker's parents may have damned him to a terrifying adolescence.

 OMV Petrom and ExxonMobil currently hold equal shares in the Black Sea Neptun deepwater exploration project estimated at 42 - 84 billion cubic meters of gas. For comparison, Romania's current gas production is of 10 - 11 billion cubic meters of gas per year.
 Last year, Exxon announced its intention to exit Romania, and OMV Petrom representatives too have repeatedly argued that unless the Offshore Law is amended, gas extraction from the Neptun Deep block will become uncertain.
 In early October, Secretary of State with the Ministry of Energy Niculae Havrilet said that the Ministry has worked out a draft amendment to the Offshore Petroleum Exploitation Law, which was agreed upon with Black Sea investors and which will be put up for public debate before the general election, but will be approved by the next Parliament.

Traditionally, many children of all ages go door to door trick-or-treating on Halloween. This year, the recommendation is to avoid that activity and consider other ways to celebrate.
 "The traditional Halloween celebration of trick-or-treating and going door to door unfortunately carries risk of transmission of COVID-19," says Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse, a Mayo Clinic pediatric infectious diseases specialist. "This year, we are discouraging participating in any activities that significantly increase your risk of transmission or exposure to the infection."
 "We are discouraging any door to door trick-or-treating, even trunk-or-treat type activities. Those are really difficult to maintain physical distancing and therefore they carry risk of transmission of infection," says Dr. Rajapakse. "They also involve the exchange of objects or candy which can also contribute to transmission of infection and we would encourage people not to take part in those types of activities this year."
 Along with discouraging trick-or-treating, Dr. Rajapakse says indoor Halloween parties also are not recommended because of the high risk of exposure or infection.
 "We also are discouraging participating in indoor Halloween parties. We know that transmission of the virus occurs relatively easily, especially in indoor settings where people are in close contact with each other," says Dr. Rajapakse. This means not meeting indoors with large groups of people is another way to reduce the risk of transmission."
 These recommendations don't mean you have to cancel Halloween. There are low- risk options to consider, says Dr. Rajapakse.
 Consider these options:
 Carve pumpkins with members of your household.
 Decorate your house, apartment or living space.
 Have a virtual Halloween costume contest.
 Have a Halloween movie night with your household members.
 Have a scavenger hunt-style trick-or-treat search with your household members in or around your home rather than going door to door.
 "Having activities outdoors instead of indoors is also another way to reduce the risk of transmission. But, unfortunately, there's no way to reduce the risk to zero anytime you have people from different households interacting, especially given the amount of transmission we're seeing in our communities still," says Dr. Rajapakse.
 If families participate in events with friends from different households, they should consider holding the event outdoors with plenty of open-air space and allow a safe distance of 6 feet apart.
 Dr. Rajapakse encourages everyone to continue following social distancing guidelines, wear a cloth mask while in public and wash your hands with warm soap and water. "This holiday season is going to be like no other we have had before. We're still in the midst of this pandemic. We are seeing rates of infection that are at their highest in some parts of the country than they have been, since we started all of this," says Dr. Rajapakse.

With the increased demand, “state payroll taxes are going to have to rise in the long run,” says Matt Weidinger, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute whose research has focused on safety net policies. “Workers pay the cost of that in terms of lost jobs and lost wages.”
 There are other proposed fixes to the U.S. social safety net that have more cross-party support.
 One of them is known as short-time compensation, or work sharing. It pays pro- rated benefits to offset lost wages for employees whose hours have been reduced — helping companies avoid layoffs and keep people in their jobs. That’s a similar goal to the Paycheck Protection Program, one of the hastily rolled-out pandemic measures.
 Plans along these lines have been key to the coronavirus response in Europe. About half of U.S. states already offer such programs, but they’re limited in scope and many businesses are unaware they exist. Biden promises to “dramatically scale up” the programs, and there’s backing for the idea among conservative economists too, including Kevin Hassett, former head of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers.

_The Holding Providers Harmless from Medicare Cuts During COVID-19 Act would ensure continued patient access to healthcare specialties that were slated for major cuts._
   
 Washington, DC, October 30, 2020 --(PR.com)-- Today the Alliance for Physical Therapy Quality and Innovation (APTQI) applauded the introduction of The Holding Providers Harmless From Medicare Cuts During COVID-19 Act of 2020, a bipartisan bill that will provide much-needed relief to dozens of specialty providers that are scheduled to incur severe Medicare reimbursement cuts amid the ongoing COVDI-19 pandemic - including physical, occupational and speech therapists.      Introduced by Representatives Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA) and Larry Bucshon, M.D. (R-IN), the bipartisan legislation would stabilize the country's healthcare system and ensure continued patient access to critical services by keeping funding levels for affected specialties at 2020 levels over the next two years. If enacted, physical and occupational therapists would be spared from a dangerous 9 percent cut that is currently set to go into effect on January 1, 2021.      "With specialty providers like physical and occupational therapists bracing for severe Medicare cuts amid an unprecedented global health crisis, The Holding Providers Harmless From Medicare Cuts During COVID-19 Act is a commonsense, bipartisan solution that will protect patient access to the vital services they need to live and live well," said Nikesh Patel, PT, Executive Director of APTQI. "We commend Representatives Bera, Bucshon, and their colleagues for their leadership in providing this critical relief to ensure specialty providers can continue to safely serve their communities. APTQI urges Congress to quickly pass The Holding Providers Harmless From Medicare Cuts During COVID-19 Act during the lame duck session."      "Doctors are the heroes keeping our families safe during these uncertain times. Cutting their pay now as they care for our loved ones is disheartening and not appropriate," said Congressman Bucshon. "No doctor should have to worry about large pay cuts while they work to get back on their feet as they continue caring for patients and battling COVID-19 on the front lines.      "As an internal medicine doctor by training, I was glad the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services increased payments for the critical work primary care and other physicians do to keep patients healthy and manage their chronic conditions," said Congressman Bera. "But cutting payments for other physicians during the middle of a global pandemic will further strain our health care system and the ability for health care professionals to serve their patients."      The introduction of the bill, which is also co-sponsored by Representatives Brendan F. Boyle (D-PA), George Holding (R-NC), Raul Ruiz, M.D. (D-CA), and Phil Roe, M.D. (R-TN), comes as Congress has become increasingly vocal in its opposition to the Medicare cuts to specialty providers. Recently, a bipartisan coalition of 229 House lawmakers sent a letter to Congressional leadership urging them to include provisions in the next pandemic relief package that would delay these harmful specialty payment cuts. In addition, 157 lawmakers, led by Representatives Roger Marshall (R-KS) and Bobby Rush (D-IL), recently sent a letter to Medicare officials, expressing deep concern over the prospect of undermining healthcare providers amid the COVID-19 public health emergency.      American voters agree. Recent polling data from Morning Consult show senior voters largely support efforts in Congress to prevent the specialty cuts from taking effect in 2021. Data shows 66 percent of senior voters are more likely to vote for candidates who work to prevent the proposed Medicare cuts from being implemented. More than three-fourths (76%) of senior voters polled would support Congress taking action to pass long-term reform that would stabilize funding for primary care and medical specialists.      About Alliance for Physical Therapy Quality and Innovation (APTQI)   The Alliance for Physical Therapy Quality and Innovation (APTQI) unites small, medium and large physical therapy practices to advocate for the physical therapy profession in the areas of payment reform, quality initiatives, outcomes and innovation projects. We are an aligned group of therapists and practices who share a common vision for the future of our profession. Our goal is to establish physical therapy as the treatment of choice and the best value for patients and payers. Learn more at aptqi.com.

“At this moment in time, I’d say we’re like a bank,” Sabus said. “We have one main entrance and we’ve got a vault set up for all of our core stuff.
 "Twelve months from now, we’re going to be like a jail.”
 Although a bank is secure, it is still open. People can walk inside and go into different rooms. Money and valuables are safe, but the building is still accessible.
 A jail is different. Entering any room, corridor, cell — even the facility itself — requires granted access. Even if one area is breached, the way to the next one is blocked off. Sabus said that is the level of security CCH is working toward for its information and cyber capabilities.
 “That’s the architecture we’re looking to be at in 12 months,” he said.
 CCH has made strides in its IT department following last year's ransomware attack. Still, Sabus said, it has more progress to make over the course of the next year.
 Among the advancements the IT department is working on are the continued development of its automated threat response, enhanced cloud services, bandwidth expansion and policy framework expansions.
 To test whether the new security changes are truly up to snuff, Sabus said the department plans to run a penetration test. In that scenario, an outside company would be hired to try to hack into CCH’s cybersecurity system. The idea is for the test to reveal any holes in security and prove that it works as intended.
 Since the pandemic began affecting hospital services in March and April, the hospital’s telehealth services have been expanded to adjust for the lack of inpatient visits.
 Those services are expected to continue, but how they are used and how they can be improved is still being brainstormed.
 “Where do we want to go long-term with it?” Sabus asked about determining how to move forward with telehealth. “What services (do) we want to apply? How can we utilize this technology and how can we make it more efficient?”
 The next year will continue to see more changes to how CCH approaches its IT infrastructure and cybersecurity, whether those changes appear obvious to the layperson on the surface. As technology evolves while hackers become more sophisticated, those changes are needed.
 “We work in the shadows,” Sabus said. “IT is not visible until it doesn’t work. It’s very easy for everybody to start thinking, ‘There’s nothing happening. There’s no work going on.’ That’s where I wanted to express that’s not true.”

Uncertainty over Okigwe bye -Election   The bye election fixed for the Okigwe Senatorial Zone,formerly billed for October, 30,2020,being tomorrow, will no longer hold.   The Independent National Electoral Commission INEC, had  suspended the election citing insecurity caused by the  ENDSARS  demonstrations which shook Nigeria to its very foundation.   However, this suddenly development has created uncertainty among the the various political parties and their candidates who are confused now on what next to do.   Trumpeta learnt that the indefinite suspension of the Election by INEC has disorganized the Candidates who were already rounding off their Campaigns when ENDSARS Demonstrations cut their plans and strategies short.   However, the major problem is that INEC has not yet communicated a new date to the candidates and parties leaving them in confusion.   However, information available to TRUMPETA has it that INEC will fix a new date whenever adequate peace returns across the Country.   "For now,the security issue is the major thing militating against fixing a new date for the election. As it stands now Security Personnel are still not comfortable among the populace who are the Voters"" TRUMPETA was told in Abuja.   Therefore, with the latest situation, both the electorate and the Candidates for the Okigwe Senate election has to wait for INEC who is waiting Security improvement and green light to go ahead with the polls.

Moving on, the next thing I wanted to kind of address was another deep dive in the portfolio this quarter, a little bit smaller in terms of the dollar amount of credits that you covered. But we did see the increase in NPAs, despite the other credit metrics kind of moving in the right direction. Is this – is the way to read this that you guys are trying to get ahead of the curve and maybe getting ahead on some properties and property types and credits that could face some issues, some greater issues if we do go into more of a lockdown scenario, if COVID cases pick up and with the expectation that we could see a flood of properties begin to hit the market in the earlier part of next years. Is this your guys’ effort, best effort to try and get ahead of this is stuff the way we should read it. Thanks.

Pakistan's innings was built on half-centuries from opener Imam-ul-Haq (58) and Haris Sohail (71), but wickets fell at such regular intervals that there was no defining partnership. Indeed, the opening pair of Imam and Abid Ali put on more than any other pair.
 Imad Wasim clubbed a pair of late sixes late in the innings on his way to an unbeaten 34 from 26 balls, but Zimbabwe were still in the game.
 Shaheen accounted for openers Brian Chari and Chamu Chibhabha, bowling both to leave Zimbabwe wobbling on 28-2 in reply, but Craig Ervine (41) and Taylor put on 71 for the third wicket, and it was game on when Taylor and Wesley Madhevere produced a century stand for the fifth.
 Yet losing Madhevere (55) early in the 46th over was a major blow, with Wahab disrupting the established partnership and giving Pakistan the breakthrough they craved.
 Taylor was next to go, top-edging to Wahab at mid-off, and the Zimbabwe lower order was blown away, along with the prospect of a tight finish.
 It meant a success for Pakistan in their first ODI since October 2019, and in the first such match played at Rawalpindi since 2006.
 Having lost 17 of their previous 18 ODIs in Pakistan, it was a largely predictable outcome for Zimbabwe, with the teams due back in action in the second match of this series on Sunday (November 1).

The leadership of the secondary teachers’ union, ASTI, says substantial progress was needed to ensure that schools are safe and can remain open, but it has not activated its threat of industrial action. The ASTI Standing Committee met today to consider the outcome of ballots supporting industrial action, up to strike, on a range of Covid-related issues as well as two tier pay scales.The meeting heard that there had been improved engagement with the Department of Education and Nphet, a number of clarifications had been provided and it was expected that this engagement would continue.There was no mention of move closer to industrial action, but ASTI President Ann Piggott said substantial progress on safety issues in schools was needed to avoid it.She said these included adequate testing and test turnaround, redefinition of close contacts, IT resources for students and teachers to facilitate continuity of learning, and reasonable accommodations for teachers in the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; category.&ldquo;We need much more progress in order to get to the point where teachers believe that the safety of students and teachers is being prioritised during this pandemic.&rdquo;In a separate ballot, ASTI members voted to take industrial action for equal pay for equal work, to be taken in conjunction with one or both of the other teacher unions.The meeting decided that the ASTI would contact the other teacher unions the INTO and TUI with a view to seeking a combined effort to bring an end to the scandal of pay inequality.Ms Piggott said &ldquo;the current teacher-shortage crisis is a result of an unfair pay gap that cannot be allowed to continue. Teachers affected are on a different pay scale than their colleagues for their entire career.&ldquo;This destructive policy has caused a drop in morale and has exacerbated a recruitment and retention crisis in second-level teaching. We will be seeking to work with the INTO and the TUI to end pay inequality.&rdquo;

Staff members reported the incident to the facility manager, Katrina Perkins, and the facility director, Jeffrey Smith. Neither of them notified EMS nor the victim’s family. Furman's health started to decline rapidly, but already unaware family members were not allowed to visit due to COVID-19 regulations. The facility brought in a third-party nurse to examine severe pressure ulcers on the victim due to not being turned properly. The nurse took pictures of the concerning ulcers and sent them to the family.
 Family members made arrangements for Furman to be removed from the facility in light of his injuries and the state of his care; however, on the day he was set to leave, the facility failed to perform a bedside swallow examination prior to Katrina Perkins giving him a doughnut to eat. Due to neglecting to perform a swallow test to assess any risk of dysphagia, Furman choked on the doughnut, dying two days later. The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office (FCMEO) found pieces of dough in the victim’s throat during the autopsy, ruling accidental asphyxia as the cause of death.
 Smith and Perkins were both arrested and charged with Felony Neglect of an elder person.
 The second investigation occurred in July, when authorities began looking into allegations of an assault on 81-yea-old resident Roy Onan by employee Tiffany Taylor following a verbal altercation.
 Taylor was accused of pushing Onan to the ground, causing him to break his hip. Onan was transferred to a rehab center following the injury, where he ended up contracting COVID-19, before going home with family members. He was reported as unable to walk again, and ultimately died the second week of October.

Multi-perspective data should also be used as a fundamental part of the decision-making process and to extrapolate future possibilities in scenario planning. The future is inherently uncertain and planning for the future in times of major upheaval is not often going to give you clear cut answers or paths. This does not lessen the importance of future planning; conversely, it increases its prominence. A captain of a ship in calm waters can look out for miles and consider options at leisure. A captain in the middle of a tempest often has limited visibility and is bombarded with urgent information. This requires that leaders need to plan but may need to cycle through the planning process much more rapidly and frequently.

Mid-market private equity investor LDC has backed the management buyout (MBO) of Martin Audio from Loud Audio.
 As part of the deal, LDC, the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, has invested £12m for a significant stake in the company, alongside its current management team led by managing director Dom Harter.
 The investment will enable the business to further develop its product range, improve its sales and marketing capabilities through the extension of its global distribution network, and enhance its digital infrastructure through software development.
 The global market for high-performance loudspeakers is estimated to be worth £1.1bn per annum, driven by demand around the world for live music and entertainment, and the increasing number of venues worldwide that require high-performance systems.
 Martin Audio, founded in the 1970s by sound engineer Dave Martin, now has a turnover of around £20m and employs more than 60 people. The British company says it is enjoying strong growth on the back of new product releases and continuing success in the touring market with London's British Summertime Festival at Hyde Park.
 "Our success to date has been underpinned by providing equipment of the utmost quality to help deliver an unforgettable listening experience to people across the globe," said Harter. "Being a trusted brand and operating in a growing market means the time is right for us to fast-track the growth of the business.
 "The next phase of our journey needs a growth-focused investment partner like LDC and the team has demonstrated a shared vision for the business from the outset," he continued. "Our focus is now on developing our product line even further, and ensuring we have a rock-solid infrastructure in place to extend our global reach and drive market share."
 Troy Harris-Speid, investment director at LDC in London, added: "Martin Audio has been on a fascinating growth journey since Dom joined. The business has a world class brand, history of innovative products and a management team with the ambition to build on a solid foundation to accelerate its expansion.
 "Our investment and support will provide a step change for the business, injecting capital into key growth areas and bringing on board additional expertise to help guide its strategy," Harris-Speid concluded.
 As part of the deal, LDC investment directors Troy Harris-Speid and Philip Weston will join the board, alongside James Browning who will join as non- executive director.

In 2019, U.S. giving to charity totaled nearly $450 billion. Historically, nearly one-third of that amount takes place in December, with 12% of all giving occurring in the last three days of the year!
 December and last-minute giving is often rushed, not well-planned, nor strategic. In order to maximize the impact of your giving, whether personal or in your business, start planning your approach to year-end donations now. There are a number of steps you can take to ensure your donations have a lasting and significant impact.
 _Engage your family members in conversations about what issues and causes are most important to them. Especially in this year of a pandemic, climate change impact, voting rights challenges, racial justice efforts, income and health disparities, and economic uncertainty (for nonprofits, too), meaningful conversations between and among generations about how a family wants to make the greatest impact are essential.
 _Giving through your business? Engage your stakeholders, especially your employees, about not only what issues and causes matter most to them, but how to more effectively involve them in volunteering and giving programs. If your company already has a matching gift program, or sponsors paid volunteer opportunities, take steps to make sure your employees are utilizing them. Unfortunately, the median employee participation rate for matching gift programs is only nine per cent, leaving an estimated $6 to $10 billion of unclaimed matching funds each year! Company volunteer programs also tend to have relatively low participation.
 _Look through two lenses, by asking two critical questions in either a business or family setting:
 What difference do we want to make in our communities?
 What difference do we want to make for our family or business?
 Both questions are important in creating an effective strategy to achieve both internal and external goals through philanthropy. Donors who neglect one or both of these questions miss the opportunity not only to "make a difference," but also to fully engage family members or business stakeholders in meaningful communication about values, goals, priorities and lessons learned.
 _Go deep, not wide, by focusing on a smaller number of carefully selected key issues, causes or organizations. Many donors adopt the "peanut butter" approach to giving — spreading their charity thinly across a wide variety of nonprofits. Donors and nonprofit organizations alike benefit when giving is focused more narrowly, moving philanthropy from merely transactional to actually transformational.
 _Give to smaller, local organizations. 2020 has been the most challenging year for nonprofit organizations in memory. Increased demands for services and decreased revenue, combined with remote workplaces and other COVID-19 restrictions, have put many on the brink of survival. It is estimated that up to one-third of nonprofits – mostly smaller and local – will not survive the pandemic and recession double whammy. Unlike bigger organizations, such as universities and hospitals, very few local or smaller nonprofits have sizable endowments to help them weather the current storms.
 _Do your research to find those organizations that are having an impact where it matters most to you. Don't only rely on friends' recommendations, glossy mailings or fancy websites to decide which nonprofits are making the difference you want to make. Reading impact reports, examining nonprofits' publicly available 990 tax returns, speaking with staff and board members, and volunteering are ways to dig deeper, learn more and find better partners to achieve your philanthropic goals.
 _Give boldly and take risks with your giving. Many donors can afford to donate more than they already give, and this year, the need to "dig deep" is critical. And, because it seeks to solve seemingly intractable problems, philanthropy can be seen as the ultimate "risk capital." Taking calculated risks with grant making may be the only way to find new solutions to old problems.
 _Ask for help from financial, tax, legal and philanthropic advisors to guide your decision-making, learn "best practices" and maximize both the joy and impact of your charitable efforts.
 2020 has been extremely challenging for most Americans, and it's not over yet. We know, however, that philanthropy is inherently optimistic — especially in divisive and disheartening times — by expressing the belief that we can have a positive impact on our own lives, on the lives of others and on vital societal issues. It also serves as a line of defense to protect core democratic values like equality, opportunity, fairness, inclusiveness and freedom of speech and thought. The issues and needs in our communities are great – don't wait until December to get started.

SEATTLE (AP) — Washington state has asked the Department of Social and Health Services to examine options for a 15% budget cut after a projected $9 billion shortfall is expected over the next two years. That could mean more than $1 billion in losses for about 12,000 elderly and long-term care recipients and more than 8,000 developmentally disabled people, KING-TV reported Thursday. DSHS spokesman Chris Wright said the potential cuts “could have a huge effect on a large portion of the population of the state.” For residents like 83-year-old Mary Spears, the cuts could prove drastic, the TV station reported. Spears exhausted her life savings paying for assisted living and is on Medicaid. She is legally blind, uses a walker and has a heart condition. The potential cuts have her family scrambling for alternatives. “It just feels like having the rug pulled out from under us,” said Spears’ daughter Sandra Brown-Potter while wiping away tears. “For years, we planned for how she would be taken care of, and to have this happen... we have no Plan B.”

Roma, 30 ott. (Adnkronos) - Un teatro aperto è una città che vive. Da questa consapevolezza nasce l'idea del Teatro Stabile del Veneto di trasformare quattro grandi teatri del Veneto in musei durante il periodo di sospensione degli spettacoli dal vivo imposto dall'ultimo Dpcm e continuare così a svolgere la funzione culturale e sociale del teatro a servizio dei territori.
 Grazie alla collaborazione dei Comuni di Padova, Treviso, Verona e Venezia, della Regione Veneto e del Teatro Stabile di Verona e con il sostegno di Intesa Sanpaolo dal 4 al 24 novembre 2020 il Verdi di Padova, il Goldoni di Venezia, il Mario Del Monaco di Treviso e il Nuovo di Verona aprono al pubblico nel rispetto di tutte le norme di sicurezza e delle disposizioni indicate dal nuovo Dpcm per accompagnare i visitatori alla scoperta delle sale storiche dei quattro teatri e non solo.
 Oltre ai tour guidati sul palcoscenico, tra i palchi e dietro le quinte, i foyer si trasformeranno, infatti, in luoghi di esposizione per ospitare opere d'arte di artisti di fama internazionale come Bruno Catalano, Annalù Boeretto e Andrea Vizzini esposti dalla Ravagnan Gallery a Venezia o Ludovico Diaz de Santillana, Peter Marino e Tobia Scarpa curatori di collezioni Venini presentate dalla Galleria Daniele a Padova, ma anche creazioni di grandi maestri artigiani del territorio, quali Marco Varisco e Umberto Visentin o di laboratori artistici locali come Vazzoler e Teknè sculture, che saranno esposti al Del Monaco grazie alla collaborazione di Confartigianato Treviso, mentre i lavori degli allievi dell'Accademia di Belle Arti di Verona troveranno spazio nel foyer del teatro veronese.
 Inoltre, in occasione dei festeggiamenti per il giorno della Rimembranza, lo Stabile del Veneto trasmetterà sugli schermi dei foyer dei teatri il cortometraggio promosso da Intesa Sanpaolo sulla grande guerra Attimi eterni di Daniele Capuzzo, giovane musicista originario di Crespano e iscritto al Conservatorio di Vicenza, e del videomaker Jose Cruz. Un lavoro nato da una passeggiata fatta dal giovane artista lungo gli itinerari del Grappa dedicati alla Memoria dei caduti e rivolto a tutti quei ragazzi, suoi coetanei, che in quelle trincee hanno perso la vita.
 Mentre le mostre saranno aperte al pubblico, con accessi contingentati, dal martedì al sabato, per prendere parte alle visite guidate sarà necessario sulla piattaforma Eventbrite accedendo direttamente dal sito del Teatro Stabile del Veneto oppure attraverso prenotazione telefonica ai numeri 049-87770225 per Padova e Venezia, 042-21520656 per Treviso e 045-8006100 per Verona.
 Dopo aver ospitato il Van Gogh di Bruno Catalano nell'ambito della Multi-Site Exhibition dell'artista francese organizzata a Venezia dalla Ravagnan Gallery, il Teatro Goldoni torna a collaborare con la prestigiosa galleria veneziana e accoglie nel proprio foyer otto opere d'arte, tra sculture e dipinti, realizzati da altrettanti artisti di fama internazionale. Book Silver opera in vetroresina, argento e inchiostri dell'artista veneziana Annalù Boeretto; Senza Meta, olio su tela, di Nadia Cascini pittrice aretina molto legata alla città di Venezia; Davide e Angelo, entrambe sculture in bronzo, dell'artista di origini marocchine Bruno Catalano; Space Attraction, scultura in bronzo, realizzata dal francese Romain Langlois; Still Life con Ciliegie, olio su tela, dell'artista autodidatta Martha Marvin; My Lady 1 è l'opera di Attasit Pokpong, una delle stelle in ascesa della scena artistica contemporanea tailandese. Noi nel Mondo, un'unica cosa dello scultore toscano Andrea Roggi; Installazione con Contaminazione, opera realizzata con tecnica mista su tela, di Andrea Vizzini.
 Sono le numerose collaborazioni con artisti italiani di formazione veneziana, ma anche di architetti e designer di fama internazionale che nell'esperienza dei maestri vetrai hanno trovato conoscenza e tecnica tali da dar vita a creazioni dal design intramontabile, che trovano spazio nell'esposizione di collezioni Venini realizzata dalla padovana Galleria Daniele al Teatro Verdi.

Prince William's utmost respect to the crown and duty is believed to have played a part his rift with his younger brother Prince Harry, according to British media.
 Quoting a royal biographer , a website wrote that the Duke of Cambridge, who is the future king, showed similar ruthlessness that he inherited from his grandmother.
 According to Express.co.uk, Prince William showed concern for the speed at which the relationship between his brother and Meghan was going.
 Citing the book "Battles of Brothers" written by Robert Lacey, the publication reported that Harry didn't perceive this worry as a mere concern from an older brother for a blossoming relationship.
 Talking to Vanity Fair, Lacey said, "At the end of the day we saw a ruthlessness from the Queen over her absolute refusal to allow the Sussexes to use the word royal for their new branding, and we’re seeing the same ruthlessness in William."  
 During the summit which took place at Sandringham in January, Prince William, Prince Charles and the Queen discussed with Prince Harry the terms of his and Meghan's exit from the family as full-time working royals.
 Harry and Meghan had to cave in on their requests to continue to carry out royal duties and give up their first brand, Sussex Royal.

As the smartphone market has grown, the technology crammed into each device has exploded beyond imagination. It is estimated that the processing power of the average iPhone is 100,000 times greater than the computer on board the Apollo 11 which landed men on the moon over 50 years ago. Although absolute handset cost has fallen since the first devices in the early 70s, in recent years prices have begun to creep up and owning the latest devices has become increasingly difficult for tech-hungry consumers.

 A Certified Technology Design Specialist (CTS-D), Don joins BL&S with an impressive 20+ year history of success managing complex projection system installations and sound systems, as well as managing the installation department for a large AV solutions provider.

"His keen attention to detail in technical installations is impressive. We’re pleased to have him as a member of our team.""The company’s commitment to their craft is one of the things that drew me to Boston Light & Sound," Don said.

Matt Triche can't keep up with the number of workout plans he's created or reviewed over the past five months.
   
 As the athletic trainer at New Hanover High School and the lead trainer for New Hanover County Schools, Triche is used to focusing on injury prevention and emergency management. Those two items are still a big part of Triche's day-to-day life, but he's also been on the front lines trying to provide a safe environment for high school athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 He's not alone. Triche, New Hanover athletic director Keith Moore and all of the Wildcats' coaches have adopted the "it takes a village" mindset. The same group effort is discussed at the three other high schools inside New Hanover County, and across North Carolina. Everyone involved with a school's athletic department plays a part, whether it's conducting temperature checks, practicing social distancing or encouraging their students to wear masks whenever possible.
   
 All the preparation has led to this Wednesday, when official tryouts for volleyball and cross country programs under the N.C. High School Athletic Association umbrella take place. It will be the official resumption of high school sports since spring contests were halted March 14. Matches and meets will resume Nov. 18, the first time schools will intermingle and a small section of fans will be able to attend.
   
 "At the end of the day, all of our jobs focus around the well-being of the students inside our buildings," Triche said. "Just the opportunity to have sports goes a long way in that mindset, but we all have to be vigilant over the next five months. Just because sports are back, that doesn't mean it's time to take our foot off the gas."
   
 A whole new world
   
 The NCHSAA has released a dense set of guidelines for sports this academic year, based off executive orders from Gov. Roy Cooper and consultation with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. They're constantly changing, too, to best tackle the up-to-date happenings of the coronavirus.
   
 Those guidelines will create a whole new world for high school sports athletes, coaches and fans. For example, face coverings must be worn at all times by anyone not involved in the contest, and each student will be responsible for his or her own water bottle, towel, hand sanitizer and other personal items.
   
 Currently, outdoor facilities can host 100 fans, but only 25 spectators will be allowed to attend volleyball contests when the season kicks off. That number could increase when Executive Order 170 expires on Nov. 13, but there would need to be a shift in North Carolina's current COVID-19 trends, according to NCHSAA commissioner Que Tucker.
   
 It will be up to individual schools to decide which fans are allowed to attend. In the Mideastern Conference, for example, senior volleyball players on the home team will be given two tickets for family members, and the rest of the roster will get one ticket.
   
 The NCHSAA is also letting individual Local Educational Agencies (LEA) determine if locker rooms can be used. Ashley athletic director Kelly Lewis said locker rooms and weight rooms in New Hanover County would primarily be closed at the start of the athletic year.
   
 "I think there are examples like that all over the place of how things are going to just have a different and weird feel this year," Lewis said. "Football is going to be old school with halftime talks coming right behind the goal post. The only time kids are going to use the locker rooms are to change for football, which might be 8-10 kids at a time."
   
 Sport-specific regulations have also been put into place for volleyball, cross country and swimming. As each sport approaches on the calendar, new guidelines will be released. Basketball will be the next sport to have its own specific guidelines released.
   
 All of these precautions are designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, but what if a student or coach does catch the virus? The NCHSAA has established guidelines for all schools to follow.
   
 To resume athletic activity, a student, coach or staff member must go 10 days without a positive test, have no fever and not used any fever-reducing medicine for at least 24 hours. Other symptoms must also improve, and a "Return to Play" form must be completed by a licensed medical professional.
   
 Violation of any NCHSAA guideline could lead to a significant penalty.
   
 "I have full faith our administrators would never knowingly break a rule or withhold information that might put our student-athletes at risk," Tucker said. "We will be diligent, but rest assured, if our membership were to have a school or staff that doesn't comply with our guidelines, that would fall as a health and safety violation under our handbook. There could be a financial penalty, and we could also go in and shut the program down for the year."
   
 Still an uphill climb
   
 The road to this point has been far from smooth. In fact, with only days remaining until the first practice, 12.9 percent of NCHSAA member schools still have not resumed workouts in any form, according to HighSchoolOT.com.
   
 Some charter schools, like Raleigh Charter and Durham's Voyager Academy, have extended their dead periods until further notice. Hillsborough's Eno River Academy announced it would not compete in athletics during the 2020-21 school year.
   
 It's not only the charter schools canceling seasons. Lejeune High School announced on Oct. 16 it cannot hold basketball, wrestling or cheer seasons, as Dept. of Defense protocols wouldn't allow it for the school located on Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville.
   
 Even schools that plan to compete in sports have faced challenges. Across the state, districts have spent significant money on personal protective equipment and other supplies.
   
 And there are no guarantees the upcoming seasons won't have delays or cancellations after they start. The North Carolina Independent School Athletic Association went with an abbreviated fall season, and at least two schools, in Wilmington and High Point, had to suspend athletics for a period of time due to COVID-19 clusters.
   
 But ask coaches and administrators if the time, money and effort is worth it, and the answer is a resounding yes. As Commissioner Tucker puts it, guarded optimism is a healthy kind of hope.
   
 "Young people deserve this opportunity," Tucker said. "We've talked for seven months now about how awful it was to have spring sport athletes lose a season. It's imperative we do all we can to make sure that doesn't happen again, while mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. I'm optimistic we can balance the two, because it's what these kids and our schools truly deserve."

I can remember the first time I decided to learn to hunt with a bow. I was about 30 years old. Yeah, I know this seems old to some of you but at that time I did more fishing than hunting. I can also remember my friend Tim easing my mind concerning my ability to use one. He was one of the owners of the store I frequented. To me, the complexity of this particular weapon seemed overwhelming. His calm admonition to me was that once he tuned my bow and adjusted the sights, the principle would be the same as my gun. Put the sight on the target, hold steady, and slowly squeeze the trigger. Of course, he was right and the more I practiced the more I became comfortable with the whole process. Since that day, I have hunted with archery equipment more than any other way. And it all started with one thing: encouragement. It is perhaps the most powerful tool in existence. It has been the single greatest catalyst for more inventions, discoveries, and accomplishments, than any other motivation. Much of the time it is the difference between success and failure and always between fatigue and perseverance. Encouragement is the offense on any team. It does not allow one to stand still but is ever motioning to gain ground. Not too long ago, my granddaughter came in from soccer practice. The only thing she mentioned was how the coach bragged on her. What do you think that caused her to do? Gain ground. Encouragement is the gift that keeps on giving. Are you an encourager? There is absolutely nothing you will ever do that will move your interests forward more than encouraging those who work with you or for you. And while encouragement may even take monetary sacrifice, it will always return in multiplied and varied profits.
 Is it any wonder the number one reason God wanted his people to come together each week was to be encouraged and to encourage others? It shames me how we have twisted this original idea into a knock-off from the Old Testament law. We have placed everything else above this main purpose. Instead of worship, praise, giving, and preaching becoming the _means_ for encouragement when we gather, we have made each of these an end in themselves. And many times we even do it at the expense of encouragement. There is one thing for sure, when encouragement becomes absent so will the people who need it. Everything else they will be able to do at home. If you want your faith family to gain ground, encouragement will do the trick. You can do it!
