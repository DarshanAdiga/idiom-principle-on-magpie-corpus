A relaxing round of golf turned into excitement for Hondo Bierestedt after he got his first hole-in-one at the Alice Municipal Golf Course.
   
 The 17-year-old from Freer was joined by his father Dean Bierestedt and three friends, Ray Montez, Gunner Montez and Jacob Cantu on the golf course.
   
 Hondo hit his golf ball with his 8-iron and off it flew landing in the small cup 150 yards away on hole 13 on a Par 3 course, Dean said.
   
 In golf, a hole-in-one occurs when a ball is hit from a tee and goes straight in the cup.
   
 Hondo has been playing golf since the age of four. He will be a senior at Freer High School and the quarterback for the Freer Buckaroos. He plays several sports and is an avid outdoors men.
   
 Dean said that when his son saw where his golf ball landed he was jumping with excitement almost knocking him over. The moment Hondo retrieves his golf ball was captured on video by his friends.
   
 According to the National Hole-in-One Registry, a hole-in-one is scored once in every 3,500 rounds.

ALBANY -- New York's free tuition program for SUNY and CUNY may face the chopping block due to the state's massive budget hole.
 The Excelsior Scholarship program was started in 2017 and provides free tuition for students whose households earn less than $125,000 a year. SUNY tuition last fall was $7,070.
 But the state agency that administers the program only started Friday to accept new applications for the program for the fall semester, citing the state's $13 billion budget gap due to the coronavirus pandemic and raising questions about how much money will be available for the free tuition without more federal aid.
 "Please note that the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically reduced state revenues and the processing of new applications is pending on Federal assistance, which has been delayed since April," the Higher Education Services Corp. wrote on its website.
 "Excelsior Scholarship awards may have to be reduced and/or prioritized for current recipients as provided for under the program."
 Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the state Budget Division, said the application period opened Friday, "providing the opportunity to apply for funds that provide the middle class with the last mile of support they need to attend college tuition free."
 But he said the state faces a $61 billion revenue gap over the next four years, and so "awards may have to be reduced. We hope students and their families will join us in calling on the federal government to act."
 Getting free tuition in New York
 SUNY officials have estimated between 22,000 to 25,000 students received the Excelsior Scholarship in fall 2018 at the 64 SUNY and CUNY campuses. The state spends about $120 million on the program.
 It covers the full annual tuition for income-eligible students who meet certain academic standards, such as getting good grades, graduating on time and living in the state after college.
 SUNY tuition payments for the fall semester are due in August, the Times Union in Albany reported, and Excelsior participants are automatically re-enrolled when they fill out their financial aid forms, but first-time SUNY students were only to start to apply Friday.
 Gov. Andrew Cuomo has hailed the program as the first in the nation, and he unveiled it in January 2017 alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate and advocate for free college tuition.
 Then he signed the bill into law with Hillary Clinton, the former New York senator and presidential candidate, in April 2017.
 There is also a tuition program for private colleges in New York. It is called the Enhanced Tuition Awards and allows the colleges and the state to split up to $6,000 in tuition for students.
 Ending the program would be a huge financial hit to students amid an uncertain return to campus this fall because of coronavirus. SUNY has yet to detail its plans for the fall.
 The program is considered "the last dollar," meaning it pays the tuition for students when other tuition assistance options are exhausted, which is for students whose families earn less than about $80,000 a year.
 What is the future of free SUNY tuition?
 Cuomo in January sought to increase the income eligibility to $150,000 a year, but it was not included in the final deal in April as the state wrestled with the virus' impact on the economy.
 Cuomo has called almost daily in recent months for a federal bailout for states due to the pandemic, saying New York would have to cut services without the aid from Washington.
 Congress is currently working on a new stimulus package, and Cuomo has urged federal lawmakers to include help for states to fund schools, emergency workers and public programs.
 Cuomo said Sunday the pandemic has cost the state about $5 billion. New York has had the most deaths in the nation due to COVID-19 -- about 25,100.
 "We know that we'd have to have drastic budget cuts if we don't get aid," Cuomo told reporters on a conference call.
 "So I'd ask the Republican congresspeople, put your politics aside. Stand up, call on your colleagues to actually do the right thing and represent the people of the state rather than your political party, and do it as loudly as you play politics for your party.
 "Because if we don't get state aid from Washington it's going to be a very bad situation for this state and the people in this state."

Remember coming inside from playing in the yard as a kid and throwing some Totino's pizza rolls in the toaster oven as an afternoon snack? Because same. But it looks like kids these days have even more snacks to choose from now, because Totino's is teaming up with Takis to make Takis Fuego Mini Snack Bites.
 Similar to the pizza rolls that are always on your grocery list, these come in small bite-sized pieces that are ideal for snacking any time of day. For those who enjoy an extra kick, these are the way to go because each bite is coated in Takis Fuego seasoning and has creamy, melty mozzarella cheese on the inside.
 Though Takis Fuego adds more spice, this flavor is known for its lime-heavy taste so it won't burn your mouth but it'll rather add a zesty finish. If you aren't too found of chile, you can always dip these in ranch or blue cheese just as you would a hot wing.
 An added bonus is just how easy these are to prepare, as they require only about one-and-a-half minutes in the microwave or nine-to-14 minutes in a 425 degree oven if you want an extra crunch. With snacks like these, I always throw them in the air fryer to get them warmed all the way through with an outer crunch to every piece.
 Packs of 60 Takis Fuego Mini Snack Bites are available at mainstream retailers this month for around $5 per bag. Step aside, pizza rolls, there's a new spicy sheriff in town.

WESLACO -- As recovery and cleanup efforts got underway Monday in South Texas in the wake of a downgraded Hanna, worried residents confronted the prospect of undertaking the effort amid a surge in coronavirus cases that has left many fearful about their health.
   
 Now a tropical depression, Hanna was 65 miles north of Fresnillo in the Mexican state of Zacatecas as its winds weakened to about 25 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Its remnants still threatened to bring rainfall and flash flooding to waterlogged parts of South Texas and northern Mexico.
   
 For 66-year-old Nora Esquivel, who has mostly stayed in her home in Weslaco, in Hidalgo County, since March because of the pandemic, flooding damage to her home from Hanna meant a greater chance of exposure to the virus.
   
 "No contact with nobody, only my daughter once in a while, and now with this, I have to allow people to come into my house, the insurance and all this, and I'm scared," said a tearful Esquivel, who takes heart medication and had to be rescued from her home Sunday morning by her son in a kayak.
   
 "All my friends are dying. ... I have fear for my family, for everybody, not just me, and this is the whole world."
   
 In the aftermath of Hanna, which dumped up to 16 inches of rain in some parts of South Texas and northern Mexico, officials reported two people died in the northern Mexican city of Ramos Arispe, near Monterrey, after torrents of water unleashed by Hanna swept their vehicle away. Three people were reported missing in Monterrey, and three more were missing in the border city of Reynosa, across from McAllen, according to Mexico's national civil defense office.
   
 Gov. Greg Abbott said the state was sending additional testing supplies and hospital personnel to South Texas communities affected by Hanna to ensure that the storm doesn't exacerbate the spread of the virus.
   
 "The spread of COVID can be far more deadly than the damage caused by the storm," Abbott said on KRGV-TV. He planned to tour damaged areas on Tuesday.
   
 The governor asked residents to adhere to social distancing guidelines and to wear masks if they had to leave their homes and go to a shelter. Officials said shelters were set up to be as safe as possible, with temperature checks by on-site medical personnel. Some were being sheltered in hotel rooms.
   
 Border communities hit by Hanna were already strained by COVID-19 cases, with some patients being airlifted to larger cities.
   
 In Cameron County, next to Hidalgo County, officials said they were grateful the hurricane did not overwhelm their hospitals, which continue dealing with a crush of COVID-19 patients.
   
 Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño Jr., the county's top elected official, said there were reports of at least 150 flooded homes and some roads were still impassable due to high water, but for the most part the county was doing well.
   
 "I think we're very fortunate the storm did not bring major, major flooding, and no loss of life," he said.
   
 But Cameron County officials remained concerned about the pandemic, as cases in the past week have increased by 2,587 -- more than the total from mid-March to July 1. The county has more than 7,800 cases. Deaths have increased by 81 in the past week, Treviño said. A week ago, the county had 96 deaths.
   
 North of Cameron County in Nueces County, Corpus Christi reported that 60 infants tested positive for COVID-19 from July 1 to July 16.
   
 Coastal states scrambled this spring to adjust emergency hurricane plans to account for the virus, and Hanna was the first big test.
   
 More than 65,400 customers remained without power Monday throughout South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and McAllen, utility officials said. That was down from a peak of 200,000 early Sunday morning.
   
 In the Mexican border city of Reynosa, a maternity hospital was damaged by heavy rain, with some patients moved to upper floors and others evacuated to other facilities, said Pedro Granados, director of civil protection for Tamaulipas state.
   
 In the Mexican city of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, the rains shook tents in a refugee camp housing an estimated 1,300 asylum seekers, including newborns and elderly people, who have been waiting for months for court dates under a U.S. immigration policy informally known as "Remain in Mexico."
   
 Abbott announced Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had approved an emergency declaration that will provide federal aid.
   
 Hanna blew ashore as a Category 1 storm late Saturday afternoon with winds of 90 mph not far from Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles south of Corpus Christi.
   
 Hanna came nearly three years after Hurricane Harvey made landfall northeast of Corpus Christi, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.
   
 Associated Press writer Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report.

“One of the most important things to remember is to ensure all of your animals that can be brought inside are safe and secured in the home during a hurricane. Dogs have more sensitivities to the weather and tend to become fearful during storms. Creating a safe space for your dog, for example: a covered dog kennel with their favorite blankets and toys inside can help to keep your dog safe and help them feel comfortable during a hurricane. It is best to ensure you have a three day supply of food and water for your pets, along with any medications they may require. Since dogs can become easily spooked during bad weather, ensure they are on a secure leash when going outside to potty or for walks.  Guarantee your dogs safety by getting them a collar and tag with your contact information. In the event they slip out of the house and get lost a finder will be able to quickly and directly contact you. One of the most important steps in lost pet recovery is microchipping. Under the new Bill 59, all cats and dogs are required to have microchips. A microchip is a small implant, about the size of a grain of rice. It is typically implanted under the skin between the animals shoulder blades. A microchip stores a unique number code for your animal. When your lost animal is found, a veterinarian or rescue will scan for a microchip. If your animal is microchipped your contact information will pull up and they can contact you ASAP. It is important to microchip an animal as it is a permanent form of identification. Collars can break or an animal can slip out of them in a moment of panic. But a microchip is a lifelong implant that helps to identify your animal.”

 Pelicans players have said publicly that they plan to take advantage of an NBA ruling allowing messages on jerseys. In early July the NBA and its players association agreed on social justice messages that can be displayed on the back of jerseys.
 All 16 New Orleans players have chosen to deliver some message.
 In all, there will be nine different messages: Freedom, I can't breathe, Listen to us, Peace, Power to the People, Say their names, Vote and Equality (Nicolo Melli will have Uguaglianza , which translates to "equality" in Italian), and Black Lives Matter.
