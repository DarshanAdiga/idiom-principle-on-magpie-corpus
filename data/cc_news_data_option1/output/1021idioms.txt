“Without question it’s got everyone concerned,” said Ray Waddell, president of media and conferences at Oak View Group, which owns concert trade publication Pollstar. “There’s a whole economy around touring and shows and everybody’s impacted. It starts with the artists and then spreads down to the venues and people who work at the venues, and the agents who are trying to route tours, and the managers who are trying to do the right thing for their artists — ethically and morally the right thing — and the event producers, and all the people that go — the fans.”

Prince Charles postpones spring tour over coronavirus pandemic  
 The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are postponing next week's spring tour to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus and Jordan "owing to the unfolding situation with the coronavirus pandemic", Clarence House has said.  
 Clarence House said the request came from the Government.
 Charles and Camilla are understood to be in good health.
 The trip was to be the first official royal visit to Cyprus for 27 years.
 Charles was due to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina on 17 and 18 March, and be joined by Camilla in Cyprus from 18 to 21 March, before heading to Jordan together until 25 March.

“Every hour, something new comes up,” added Kreinbrink. “There are so many unknowns. We’ll just have to take it day by day.”
 The state’s wrestling championships were also halted with 22 area wrestlers missing out on a chance to compete this weekend.
 Wayne Trace coach George Clemens would have taken three to state, sophomores Jarrett Hornish (113), Hunter Long (126) and junior Eli Moore (160).
 “I was just getting ready to go to the school, to get ready to leave for Columbus, when I was texted with the news,” said Wayne Trace coach George Clemens. “Of course, then I had to tell our three guys that had qualified that the state tournament has been cancelled. This is something that’s never happened in my lifetime and I never thought could happen. And I hope never happens again. It’s a sad day for the wrestling community. So many kids and coaches put in the extra time during the summer and then during the season, in order to get to the state meet. I’m hoping they can somehow get this resolved so that the meet can take place in a month. But IO hope something like this never happens again.
 Wauseon coach Mike Ritter and a couple of assistant coaches were going to take four wrestlers to state, one sophomore, Lawson Grime (138), one junior, Damon Molina (113) and two seniors, Jarrett Bischoff (160) and Sammy Sosa (285).
 “It’s really disappointing and I’m crushed, that our four guys can’t compete at the state meet,” Ritter said. “We had one senior who was going to compete at state for the first time (Sosa) and another who hadn’t been to state in three years (Bischoff). I know they (the OHSAA) are trying to do the right thing for the kids, but it’s very unfortunate. Quite honestly, I think the season is done. I don’t see a scenario where they make things up. There’s no end in sight, because they would have to do a lot of rescheduling of the event and the site. Also, with school now being out for three weeks, there’s a potential that they could shut practices and everything else down, but I don’t know that, yet.”
 Though Defiance had just one wrestler competing in the state championships, that one wrestler missed out on his final shot at the state tourney.
 “This is very frustrating, especially for a young man like Tristan Villarreal who has worked and finally qualified as a senior — literally his last shot at competing,” said Defiance wrestling coach Pat Murphy. “With that said, I believe that our government officials are taking the actions they deem most appropriate for the health and safety of the citizens they serve. Nothing like this has been witnessed in my lifetime, which causes me to believe that there is evidence behind the actions.
 “If several months from now we look back and say to ourselves “Gee, that wasn’t so bad”, it will most likely be due to proactive decisions, rather than reactive ones. I will not be one of the naysayers or conspiracy theorists pounding a table demanding explanations. This stinks, but tough decisions have to be made at times. This appears to be one of those times.”
 Added Archbold coach Brian Becher: “I always talk to our wrestlers about focusing on what they can control. This is one of those things that we obviously can’t, so for us to complain about it doesn’t do us any good. There are a lot of uncertainties right now. When we learn more, then we will formulate a plan and move forward.”

 Kestner was again perfect at the plate for Defiance, going 2-for-2 with a walk, run scored and an RBI while freshman Josh Vischer had two hits in three at-bats, knocking in a run. Kaffenbarger stroked his second triple of the day while drawing a base on balls, driving in a run and scoring one.
 Freshman Brant Richardson started on the hill and got the victory for the Yellow Jackets after going six innings with a strikeout and walk. Tyler Hines tossed a perfect final inning with a strikeout.

Today, the company announced that it is temporarily suspending its commission fees (up to $100 million) for independent restaurants nationwide. According to CNBC, those restaurants sometimes pay commission fees as high as 30 percent on orders delivered by third-party companies like Grubhub.
 It makes sense from a business perspective. Independent restaurants drive more than 80 percent of Grubhub's orders. If they are forced to close because they lose customers during the coronavirus pandemic, Grubhub will lose restaurants to serve. Some estimates predict dine-in traffic will slow up to 75 percent over the next few weeks. Pickup and delivery orders could help restaurants stay in business and prevent them from laying off staff.
 "Independent restaurants are the lifeblood of our cities and feed our communities," Grubhub Founder and CEO Matt Maloney said in a statement. "They have been amazing long-term partners for us, and we wanted to help them in their time of need. Our business is their business -- so this was an easy decision for us to make."
 Grubhub has also created a fund that will allow proceeds from its Donate the Change program to go toward charities supporting restaurants and drivers impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Diners who round up the change on their orders will be able to donate it to the Grubhub Community Relief Fund. The company will match donations from Grubhub+ and Seamless+ members, and it will work with local city officials to select organizations that can use the funds.
 "Banding together during hard times, putting people over profit, and supporting our local businesses is a model we should all follow, and I thank Grubhub for leading the way," said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
 Grubhub and other third-party food delivery services have begun offering no- contact delivery options, and they're sharing health and safety guidelines with drivers and diners. Other delivery and gig economy businesses, including Instacart, Lyft, Postmates and Uber, are considering ways to compensate drivers affected by the virus.

Miami Mar 13 (AFP) A 2020 Tokyo Olympic football North American qualifying tournament that was scheduled to begin next Friday in Mexico has been postponed by organizers due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 The Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) announced it was delaying the event and all other competitions for 30 days. The eight-team Olympic qualifier had been set for March 20-April 1 at Guadalajara, Mexico.
 It features the United States, Costa Rica, Mexico and the Dominican Republic in Group A with Honduras, Canada, El Salvador and Haiti in Group B.
 The two top teams in each group will advance to the semifinals, with the winners of those games qualifying for Tokyo.
 "The CONCACAF Council took these decisions with the welfare of everyone involved in mind and in light of developing travel restrictions and public health guidance," a statement from the regional governing body said.
 CONCACAF Champions League playoff matches and 2021 Gold Cup qualifying first- round matches were also suspended. AFP

Over 600 wrestlers, dozens of hockey players, over 200 girls basketball players and hundreds more boys basketball players had their dreams at state glory halted as the Ohio High School Athletic Association announced its decision to postpone regional boys hoops and the state girls basketball, wrestling and ice hockey championships this week indefinitely due to the growing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic.
 After that, the decision from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to extend a three-week spring break coming up beginning Monday further threw wrenches into the plans ahead for any possible re-installment of the winter championships and the startup for the upcoming spring sports seasons.
 So much is still unknown and so much more is still undecided over the next few months and will continue to be.
 But what is known is the heartbreak that is having a dream ripped away.
 My heart aches for the Napoleon girls basketball team, in the midst of the greatest season in school history, primed to bring a state championship home to a ravenous community that – if not for the attendance restrictions assigned earlier in the week – would have swarmed St. John Arena in Columbus to pull for the Wildcats to bring back a title.
 Heck, up until about 11:30 this morning, I had full plans on driving over to Napoleon, sitting down at Spengler’s for a nice lunch and mingle with the community before joining a packed house at ‘The Grand Canyon’ for a community viewing party for the D-II state semifinals.
 It had all the makings of a wonderful story, a community’s drive to overcome adversity and support their hometown team any way they could.
 Until it wasn’t.
 My heart also aches for the wrestlers that likely saw their shot at competing on the state’s biggest stage taken away. These guys put their heart and soul, their literal blood, sweat and tears on the mats, battle every week in the most human way possible, trying to out-strength and out-maneuver their counterparts in the hopes of having their arms raised in the Schottenstein Center and potentially walking through the pyrotechnics in the Walk of Champions.
 OHSAA Executive Director Jerry Snodgrass, who has taken (unfairly, in my opinion) an incredible amount of heat for a decision for which his hands were tied, said as much during his press conference announcing the decision to postpone.
 “We have to make the wise decision, tough as it is, to postpone indefinitely,” said Snodgrass to a small conference in St. John Arena as the D-II semifinal between Beloit West Branch and Dayton Carroll stopped before it even started. “I can’t say that I know their emotions but I know the work they’ve put into it ... When our staff puts the stars on the court (signifying the cities competing at state), that’s emotional for us.
 “We’re never going to do something to discount safety, just to go on for money or for the sake of the event. We have to do what’s right.”

Why are blacks still inclined to attribute the challenges they face to racism? Because that’s all they hear from left-wing black media moguls who are in business to get a rise out of people, rather than enlighten them.
 A major theme being peddled in the current Democratic presidential campaign is that wealth is evil. Candidates are tripping over one another to see who can come up with a better tax on wealthy Americans.
 But is punishing wealth and achievement the answer for improving the lives of black Americans or any Americans?
 According to one study, 69% of those on _Forbes_ magazine’s list of 400 wealthiest Americans are self-made. And 20% grew up poor.
 Dr. Ben Carson, now secretary of housing and urban development, rose from a Detroit ghetto; he was raised by a single mother and later became a world- renowned neurosurgeon. His story, how his mother made her sons turn off the television and read at least one book every week, should be read by every American child.
 Surely, if blacks continue to buy the lie that the poor are poor because the rich are rich, 50 years from now there will still be no change in the wealth gap between black households and the rest of the country.
 It’s so easy to hate. It’s so easy to blame others for your problems. And it’s so hard to take responsibility for your life, regardless of the circumstances.
 But hate, blame and mockery are the meal ticket of black liberals.
 So for them, conservative black Christians standing by the president, standing at the seat of power, is a red flag. The idea that freedom, faith, family, marriage and personal responsibility are the path to the good life is the last thing they want to see legitimized.
 Once, the great challenge that black Americans faced was the scourge of racism and the acts of evil white men.
 Today’s great challenge for blacks is to shake off the culture of the welfare plantation and the destructive rhetoric of evil black liberals who want to keep them there.

The two weekday shows may be ideal for the daily commute. _Morning Report_ will be a fast-paced recap that brings viewers up to speed on the latest news and _Evening Report_ will have deeper analysis on current stories. _Saturday Report_ will profile the people who are driving current events, and _Sunday Report_ will take a deep dive into a single critical issue, similar to the main section of _Last Week Tonight_. This strategy does seem to align with how today's viewers want to digest news quickly, and it may provide deeper insights than the often high-level blurbs found on social media.
 NBC News' programs will be joined by about 170 additional shows planned for Quibi's first year of service. The mobile platform has plenty of industry backing, as well as buy-in from directors like Guillermo del Toro and Steven Spielberg. One of its central features is called Turnstyle, which allows the viewer to watch a show in either portrait or landscape mode -- and switch between the two on-demand. Engadget found the technology to be surprisingly effective at CES earlier this year, and turned some mild skepticism into excitement.
 A company called Eko is suing Quibi over allegations the service used stolen trade secrets to develop Turnstyle. "Our Turnstyle technology was developed internally at Quibi by our talented engineers and we have, in fact, received a patent for it. These claims have absolutely no merit and we will vigorously defend ourselves against them in court," a Quibi spokesperson told Engadget. If -- and how -- this lawsuit affects Quibi and its shows remains to be seen.

How can we miss the irony of black liberals, their lives dedicated to keeping blacks on the government welfare plantation, using insulting plantation imagery to attack conservative black Christians working for freedom and better lives for African Americans?
  _The Economist_ magazine last year ran an article with the headline “The black-white wealth gap is unchanged after half a century.”
 “(I)n 1962,” the article reports, “two years before the passage of landmark civil-rights legislation ... the average wealth of white households was seven times greater than that of black households. Yet after decades of declining discrimination and the construction of a modern welfare state, that ratio remains the same.”
 The article fails to mention that total spending on government anti-poverty and welfare programs over these years is estimated at $20 trillion.
 Why do significant gaps in wealth and income persist between black Americans and the rest of the country?
 Racism?
 Americans recently elected a black man as their president twice.
 In the elections of 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama received almost 80 million votes from white Americans.

Fearing the worst, I explained that I had just made the two-hour trip, and have heard nothing. The response?
 “Sit tight, I don’t think this is going to be played.”
 The feeling of helplessness was confirmed mere minutes later when Aaron Gross, our sports editor called me to tell me that in fact, nothing was to be played.
 I’m now torn. My heart goes out to the Napoleon girls basketball team, who may or may not get a chance to win a state title. I feel bad for Evergreen, who was in a position to do something a sports team at Evergreen has never done, reach a state final four.
 (Evergreen has had wrestlers win state titles, but the furthest a team has advanced was a girls basketball regional final, the same round the boys would have played in Saturday night).
 Also, what is to make of the 22 local wrestlers, who have worked so hard to advance to the biggest meet of their collective careers?
 For the rest of this space, I’m going to echo the same thoughts Aaron had earlier in the week.
 I get it, I’m not happy about it.
 I’m not going to make this political, for that you’ll have to follow me on Facebook, but I’ll say that earlier in the process, I was not for any of this.
 As I’ve had the time to process more information, I’ll agree that we are potentially saving lives, but for some that’s a hard pill to swallow.
 I’ll end with this.
 For those of you who planned on competing this weekend, I hope you understand the support you still receive from your school and community.
 I can tell you it sucks to not wrestle, or play basketball, in front of the largest crowds in your life, but what good does that do you?
 Look at it this way, this is a small life lesson. Sometimes life isn’t fair, but you’ll have this to look back on.
 At least you have this.
 People will remember the 2019-20 winter sports season for the rest of their lives.

Rickets made the comments during a 10 a.m. press conference at the State Capitol, flanked by state medical officials, education leaders and mayors.
 So far, he said, there are 13 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nebraska.
 Ricketts emphasized that state leaders are working together to slow the spread of the virus, though Nebraskans should expect more closures.
 “We are a strong state, we are a strong nation, we are a strong people,” he said. “And we are going to get through this together.”
 Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert, who was at the meeting, said that the move to make the annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting an online-only event, announced Friday, could bring an $80 million hit to the city. She said there’s still a “glimmer of hope” that the national swim trials, scheduled in Omaha in June, will still be held.
 “All of these (cancelled) events will have a huge impact on the city,” Stothert said. “It may get worse before it gets better, but we’ll get through it.”
 And a decision on whether Nebraska holds its annual spring football game is up in the air, said University of Nebraska President Ted Carter on Friday.
 The Big 10 Conference just ordered that all team practices cease, but the conference will reevaluate that decision on April 6. That, Carter said, would be enough time to reschedule the spring game, which is a university event, not a Big 10 event.
 Ricketts said there are two general indicators of spread that could prompt a school closure decision.
 One scenario would be if health officials determine that 1% of the population in a region contracts the disease.

New Delhi, Mar 13 (PTI) The government from Monday will open booking of website names in nine Indian scripts including Sanskrit, Kashmiri, Kannada, Oriya, Sindhi and Malayalam.
 The autonomous body National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) , under the Ministry of Electronics and IT, has invited applications under the sunrise period starting March 16 to book the entire website name in nine Indian scripts with Bharat as the top level domain which can also be written in the same scripts.
 While this facility was already available for languages using Devanagari script, the booking has been opened for eight new languages. The other scripts are Assamese and Santhali in which the entire website name can be booked.
 "The sunrise period will begin March 16 and ends on June 15. We will collect applications and check that there are no trademark or copyright issues. The allocation of dispute free domain will begin thereafter. Each domain applied during the sunrise period will have to be booked for a period of 5 years," a NIXI official, who did not wish to be named, told PTI.
 The move to start website registration in regional languages is part of international internet body ICANN agenda to facilitate more people access internet by curbing language barrier.
 "This makes India a global leader in the internationalized domain name space to have maximum IDNs in different languages. We are getting ready to launch email addresses in all the remaining languages. People with the Datamail app will be able to get email addresses in all 22 Indian languages," Ajay Data, Founder & CEO, Data Ingenious Global said.

The younger Veeck – first as the owner of the independent St. Paul Saints and then as the owner of the Charleston Riverdogs, among other minor league teams – continued the family tradition. He was the brains behind “Labor Day,” during which pregnant women were admitted free of charge; “Lawyer Appreciation Night,” when attorneys had to pay double the price of admission; and “Mime-O- Vision Night,” a game in which mimes recreated plays for the crowd.
 Not everyone has always been on board with Veeck’s publicity stunts. Eighteen years ago, one of the Riverdogs’ players told Veeck that he didn’t think “Nobody Night” was a good idea.
 “Remember what an empty park feels like,” Veeck responded. “It’s a great life lesson.”
 In other words, never forget the fans.
 Many athletes will learn that lesson in the coming days, weeks and perhaps months.
 The fear of the spread of the disease has changed how we watch the game because we can’t watch the game the way we always have – at least right now And, adding to this uncertainty, we don’t know how or even when sports will return to the way they’ve always been.
 Dae Hee Kwak, an associate professor and director of the Center for Sports Marketing Research at the University of Michigan, said sometimes things happen that can overwhelm even sports.
 “Say the virus lingers on and on. And governments continue banning mass- audience events and people go along with some version of self-quarantine,” Kwak said. “Will the games look and feel different on TV? Will people be disappointed, especially in places where attending games is part of their identity? Of course.
 "But in this case, the trade-off is hardly worth it,” Kwak concluded. “The fear of endangering your family and friends and community should always be greater than the fear of any lasting harm it could do to sports.”

Karachi, Mar 13 (PTI) The Pakistan Cricket Board on Friday decided to reduce the duration of Pakistan Super League by four days and hold the matches in Lahore, including the final, without spectators as the possibility of the event being called off due to the coronavirus threat loomed large.
 The PCB said in a press release said that the remaining matches in Lahore, including the semi-finals and final, would be held behind closed doors on the advice of the Punjab government. The PSL matches on Friday were being held in empty stadiums.
 The Board also said instead of the play-offs, the top four teams will now play semi-finals and then the final on March 17 and 18. The final was originally scheduled to be held on March 22.
 The PCB said the league will move from Karachi to Lahore for the semifinals and final.
 "The remaining matches in Karachi will be held as per earlier decision without crowds and only accredited personnel would be allowed inside the stadium," the Board said.
 The decision came hours after the PCB said that the PSL will continue on schedule despite several overseas players preferring to leave for home immediately due to the coronavirus threat.
 The PCB said in a statement that it had given the option to all foreign players and support staff to withdraw from the tournament if they want to and franchises can replace them with local players and officials.
 The Board confirmed that to date England's Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Tymal Mills, Liam Dawson, Liam Livingstone, Lewis Gregory and James Vince, West Indian Carlos Braithwaite and South African Rilee Roussouw and James Foster (coach) will be returning home from the PSL.
 It said it was monitoring the situation closely with the concerned agencies and so far no player or official has tested positive for the dreaded virus in the league.
 PCB CEO Wasim Khan confirmed all issues were discussed with the team owners on Friday before allowing foreign players and support staff to go home.
 "What is paramount is: we are giving options to all the players and support personnel to withdraw from the league if they want to as ensuring they feel comfortable remains top priority of the PCB," Khan said.
 "As of now it is important to emphasise and clarify that the main concern of many of the 10 players and coach (who are returning home) revolves around avoiding a potential situation where they might become stranded due to flight cancellations or border closures in their own countries," he said.
 "We will continue to assess and review the situation. And will not hesitate to make what we believe are the right decisions for everyone involved," Khan added.

“She’s so efficient in what she does and how she prepares,” Finn said. “She works so hard. The teammate and program part – she includes everyone in everything she does. And her basketball IQ is so high. She gets it and understands it.”
 Westbeld’s devotion to hoops grew in part because of her sister Kathryn. A 2014 Fairmont graduate, Kathryn Westbeld played in three state finals (2011-2013), won a state title (2013) and was a McDonald’s All-American (2014). She earned a national championship as a senior at Notre Dame in 2018. Kathryn Westbeld currently plays professionally in Australia.
 “It’s always competitive in the house, but whenever there’s any accomplishment attained, we’re happy for each other,” Maddy Westbeld said. “She’s definitely my biggest role model and one of my biggest fans.”
 Westbeld announced via Twitter on Oct. 20 that she was going to Notre Dame. The Irish edged her other finalists (Louisville, UCLA, Ohio State and Tennessee).
 “I decided Notre Dame was No. 1, not just because of my sister and the history there, but because of the culture, the history of the girls basketball program and the competitiveness of the school,” Westbeld said. “I don’t know – you take a step on campus and it has a different feel to it.”
 She plans to major in business or political science.
 “I’ve always looked at myself as the underdog and the little sister so it’s weird to be the senior and the one being named Ms. Basketball,” Westbeld said. “It’s kind of crazy to me and a little surreal. I wasn’t focused on any of this. We had business to take care off.”
 “As a coach (Ms. Basketball) signifies what I think of her and what others do as well,” Finn said. “She’s a really, really talented basketball player. I’m excited for her and I know others are, too.
 “It’s a great honor, and she is a great rep for the award.”

The news comes as no surprise, considering the tightening cadence of bad news recently. After the World Health Organization officially declared the widespread novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday, the California Department of Public Health recommended that "large public gatherings that include 250 people or more" be postponed or cancelled, making a show like WWDC nearly impossible to justify. (For reference, WWDC attendance in recent years has hovered around 6,000.) And Apple isn't the only company facing the prospect of revamping a splashy developer event; Google has previously said that the largely outdoor I/O conference would not have an in-person component this year, and Microsoft announced that Build would go online-only yesterday, after Washington Governor Jay Inslee issued a similar ban on large-scale events.
 We've reached out to Apple for more information on how this announcement affects its plans for the show, and we'll update this story if and when they respond. For now, though, it seems likely that all of the usual announcements will take place -- in other words, expect in-depth updates on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS and more. What's less clear is whether Apple will use WWDC, as it sometimes does, to reveal new, high-profile hardware.
 The company publicly acknowledged the impact of production delays and anxiety in China last month when it warned Wall Street that it would miss its second- quarter revenue guidance. (The situation in China does appear to be improving, though; all 42 Apple Stores the company closed there in January have now re- opened.) More recent reports, however, suggest that Apple has had to postpone an iPhone launch event entirely because of slow production and concerns over gathering hundreds of journalists and partners in one place to show off the new device. If true, WWDC is the next big show on Apple's docket -- maybe the so-called iPhone 9 will make its first official appearance in a keynote livestream.
