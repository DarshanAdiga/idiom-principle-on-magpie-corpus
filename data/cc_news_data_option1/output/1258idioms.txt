Gordon, who teaches a class in commercialization of biomedical goods, said Trump likely will claim credit when GM starts making the machines. "This is an election year, and on all sides you're going to see political theater," he said.
 Critics have urged Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act broadly to control the production, supply and distribution of ventilators and protective gear for hospital workers who are running short. That's what the act was meant to do, and it was not for use against a single company, Gordon said.
 Even with increased production from all ventilator makers, however, the U.S. might not have enough of the life-saving machines. U.S. hospitals have about 65,000 of the ventilators that are sophisticated enough to treat critical coronavirus patients. It could probably cobble together a total of 170,000, including simpler devices, to help with the crisis, one expert says.
 A doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center estimates that 960,000 people in the U.S. will need to be on ventilators, which feed oxygen into the lungs of patients with severe respiratory problems through a tube inserted down the throat. Doctors hope social distancing will stop a huge number of people from getting sick simultaneously, flattening the curve of the illness so they can use one ventilator to treat multiple patients.
 Trump, in several appearances Friday, accused GM of promising 40,000 ventilators, then reducing the number to 6,000. He also said the company wanted higher prices than previously discussed.
 Ventec, which is negotiating with the government to provide more ventilators, said it only changed numbers and prices at the request of government agencies, which asked for a range of quantities and prices. The company said it's selling the ventilators, which can treat severe virus patients, at distributor cost, and it has offered scaled down versions for a lower price.
 Up until late Sunday, Ventec and GM hadn't known how many ventilators the government would buy but those details are now being worked out.
 Ventec isn't sure if it will make any money on the devices, which generally sell for $18,000 — far less than ventilators used in hospital intensive care units that can cost $50,000. Johnson says GM has no intention of making a profit.
 Ventec will need government money to help pay parts suppliers and ramp up its own production from 200 per month to 1,000 or more, said CEO Chris Kiple.
 Invoking the Defense Production Act "shined a light" on the need for ventilators, he said, but Ventec can't move any quicker.
 "We're still moving full speed ahead," Kiple said. "We know there's a shortage of ventilators."

 This story has been corrected to show that that GM intends to start production in mid-April but will not reach a rate of 10,000 per month until later.

In return for the emergency loans, which could be spun by the Federal Reserve into up to $4.5 trillion, companies will face temporary limits on what they can pay executives. They’ll also need to keep their workforces stable or at least not lay off more than 10% for several months. And they’ll face restrictions on stock buybacks and dividend increases.
 Yet loopholes may lurk in the legislation.
 “On paper, it looks like we learned the lessons,’’ said James Angel, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “But the devil is in the details. ... There’s a lot of room around the edges.”
 The legislation establishes a system of oversight for how companies can use the rescue money. The oversight is widely thought to exceed the standards for the bailouts of banks and automakers in the 2008-09 financial crisis. Critics have long attacked those bailouts as an unwarranted giveaway to corporations whose conduct contributed directly to the crisis.
 Under the just-enacted $2.2 trillion package, a government watchdog and a panel appointed by Congress will monitor how the billions in aid are deployed and whether its corporate recipients are meeting the restrictions.
 President Donald Trump wasted little time, though, in throwing the oversight system into question. After signing the relief package Friday, Trump issued a statement that seemed to reject the independence of a new inspector general’s office. He said he wouldn't recognize the inspector general's right to report to Congress without “presidential supervision.” Trump's statement went on to dispute other aspects of the oversight rules, including that Congress should be consulted in the allocation of relief money.
 By any standards, the overall package is a staggering pot of money — by far the largest in the history of crisis relief for industries and local governments. About $425 billion is to be used by the Treasury Department to support the Fed's emergency lending programs. These include loans for small and medium-sized businesses. Because the companies, states and cities are deemed likely to repay the loans, the Fed is able to to leverage the money into up to roughly $4 trillion in actual lending.
 “A program of this scale and scope ... when things are moving so fast, will need vigorous scrutiny,” said Phil Angelides, a former California state treasurer who led the 10-member congressional oversight panel for the financial-crisis bailout.
 For companies that receive emergency aid, there may be wiggle room in the conditions attached to it. While they can’t shrink their workforce by more than 10% through the fall, there’s no prohibition against cutting employee wages — except for airlines that receive direct grants. These grants must be used for employee pay and benefits.
 Companies could also reduce workers’ hours and overtime without running afoul of a ban on breaching union contracts.
 “A lot of people are going to see their compensation fall even though they still have a job,” Georgetown’s Angel said. “Just the fear of that puts the brakes on the economy.”

I found this to be an issue — a school having more than 25,000 undergraduates doesn’t have any resources to help?


  I researched some solutions. What could I do to help my university and my fellow volunteers? I found a medical study published in the US National Library of Medicine National Institute of Health about an eating disorder screening program for college students. The program puts people into categories based on how at risk of an eating disorder they are at and then, depending on the category you fall into, sets up a treatment plan.


  Three of the categories recommend online treatment shown to reduce symptoms by 50% after mild intervention. The others that didn’t recommend online treatment were for if you tested positive for having a clinical eating disorder. These recommended an evaluation by a healthcare professional. By bringing this program to UT, it could be a cost-effective way to help students who are suffering.


  Having a screening program here could save someone’s life. If this resource was something I had in high school, I wouldn’t have suffered years of being worried about every bite of food entering my body and every calorie I burned. I could’ve had my life back and enjoyed my high school years. I don’t want others to feel the way I felt and have their college years robbed from them. As volunteers, we need to stop this issue together.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia's governor on Monday ordered all higher education institutions to stop any in-person instruction amid the coronavirus pandemic, a move likely directed at Liberty University. The evangelical college in Lynchburg led by President Jerry Falwell Jr. has faced intense criticism over its decision to welcome students back to campus last week after the end of their spring break. The vast majority of classes have been moved online, but the university has said publicly that in-person instruction was necessary for a few select courses. “We are currently reviewing what the governor said but aren’t able to make a comment at this moment,” said Liberty spokesman Scott Lamb. Lamb said he couldn't immediately say whether any in-person instruction was continuing Monday, but the university's website specifically mentioned that flight training for aeronautics courses would “remain in the traditional face to face format.” Falwell, one of President Donald Trump's earliest and most ardent high-profile supporters, has generally characterized concerns about the virus as overblown. He has accused the news media of stoking fear and suggesting coverage has been politically motivated to hurt the president. Still, the university has said it would comply with all applicable governmental directives and guidance concerning COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus that has crippled economies and upended daily life around much of the world. Last week, Northam quoted from scripture in urging Falwell to rethink \"his message that invites and encourages students to return to campus.” Earlier this month, at a time when a flood of colleges began announcing plans to extend spring breaks or move instruction online, Liberty initially resisted and planned for classes...

"That is lightning-fast speed to secure suppliers, learn how the products work, and make space in their manufacturing plant. You can't get much faster than that," said Kaitlin Wowak, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on industrial supply chains.
 GM expects to start making ventilators in mid-April, ramping up to a rate of 10,000 per month at as quickly as it can. The company is working with Ventec Life Systems, a small Seattle-area ventilator maker, and both say the Defense Production Act of 1950 doesn't change what they're doing because they're already moving as fast as they can, fronting millions in capital with an uncertain return.
 "I don't think anybody could have done it faster," said Gerald Johnson, GM's global manufacturing chief.
 Peter Navarro, Trump's assistant for manufacturing policy, said Saturday that invoking the act was needed because GM "dragged its heels for days" in committing to the investments to start making ventilators at an automotive electronics plant in Kokomo, Indiana.
 It was only a few days earlier that Trump had been holding up GM and Ford as examples of companies voluntarily responding to the outbreak without the need for him to invoke the act. Then on Friday, he slammed GM on Twitter and during his daily briefing for foot-dragging. On Sunday, he was back to praising the company during another briefing: "General Motors is doing a fantastic job. I don't think we have to worry about them anymore."
 But GM says it had been proceeding on the same course all along.
 The company got into the ventilator business on March 18 after being approached by stopthespread.org, a coalition of CEOs trying to organize companies to respond to the COVID-19 disease that has already claimed more than 30,000 lives globally. The organization introduced GM to Ventec, which makes small portable ventilators in Bothell, Washington.
 The automaker pulled together manufacturing experts, engineers and purchasing specialists, and the next day had people at Ventec's facility, a short distance from a nursing home where the virus killed at least 35 people.
 They worked on speeding up Ventec's manufacturing. A few days later, GM assigned more engineers and purchasing experts to figure out how it could make Ventec's machines. Some Ventec parts makers couldn't produce enough widgets fast enough, so GM went to its own parts bin to find suppliers to do the job, Johnson said. At the same time, GM was shutting down its car and truck factories temporarily due to worker fears about the virus.
 Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan law and business professor, said he thought Trump would commend GM and use it as an example for other manufacturers in the coronavirus fight.
 "What came out was a smack on the head," he said.

Importantly, they can also carry the Tomahawk land attack cruise missile.      The rise of the Chinese Navy caught the U.S. Navy without an effective long range anti-ship missile, and the service scrambled to catch up. One result is a new version of the Tomahawk missile, Block V, also known as _Maritime Strike Tomahawk_. Most Navy warships, including destroyers, cruisers, and submarines, carry Tomahawk missiles as part of their missile inventories. Block V capabilities include the ability to change targets in mid-flight via satellite, target moving enemy ships at sea, and the new _Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System_. The Navy will convert all of its Tomahawks to the Block V configuration, enabling all ships already carrying the land attack version to now carry the ship-killing variant.

Thanks to help from a hiking companion, Patterson was able to get to Abingdon, Va., where he was able to get a rental car and get home later that day.


  "I didn't want to infect anybody, and I didn't want to be infected," Patterson said.


  Officials with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy became concerned about COVID-19 threats, too. Sandra "Sandi" Marra, president and chief executive officer of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that helps manage the trail, recently issued a public statement asking people to stay away from the trail.


  Marra said some trailhead parking lots had exceeded their maximum capacities and shelters were full of overnight hikers. She didn't believe it was a good situation amid recommendations to practice social distancing to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.


  For Patterson, ending his hike meant the halt to a trip he had long planned. The trail winds through the Tri-State area on its way to Maine. The 52-year- old disc jockey hiked across Maryland last year to train for his trip. He cleared his entire work schedule this year so he could take to the trail.


  "I have wanted to do this since I was 10 years old. That's how important this is to me," Patterson said.


  Patterson said some other hikers on the trail who were caught in the middle of the COVID-19 situation were waiting to see what to do next. Some hikers were in a "really hard place" after hostels that hikers use along the trail for lodging and other services shut down, as well as shuttle services that hikers use to get into towns to get additional supplies, Patterson said.

The project was a 48-hour challenge launched by artistic platform NICE TRY - bel-essai.


  The pair compiled visuals of the rainbow to the tune of Beatles classic _Here Comes The Sun_ — but played at a slower pace in order to reflect what the measures imposed to deal with the pandemic have done to our society.


  "Inspiration for this project comes from the fact that everything is slowing down, and also from the rainbows in the window trend. We really liked the idea and wanted to push it to its limits," Gougeon said.


  The pair says the project was a (socially distanced) team effort. About 30 of their friends contributed with materials to do the costume and by helping document the walks from at least two-metres away.

In addition to Exotic’s many ventures, including a 2016 presidential bid and reality TV series, the zookeeper is also a country music recording artist. Most of his songs like “I Saw a Tiger” are seemingly biographical, depicting his life as a lover of big cats and perpetuating the lifestyle of his alter ego. The most shocking song, however, is one that accuses Baskin of feeding Lewis to a tiger -- there’s even a lookalike shown in the music video slipping meat into the mouth of one.

WEST JEFFERSON — The Hon. Micheal D. Duncan informed both parties Thursday, March 26, that he has denied the motion for a preliminary injunction in the lawsuit between the owners of The Hotel Tavern and Old Hotel purchaser Marck Beck. The ruling comes more than three months after a hearing on the matter Dec. 18, 2019.


  The ruling was originally expected to be released Dec. 23, 2019, and it would have protected the restaurant during the lawsuit.


  Duncan wrote, "I cannot find or conclude that the Plaintiffs (The Hotel Tavern) are likely to succeed on the merits of this case as to Defendant Bridgetree."


  Tavern co-owner Andy Guion was brief with his reply, simply saying, "(Beck) won and we lost."


  "The ruling concludes that the restaurant does not have a lease and the other claims in the lawsuit against me are not valid and dropped. All of our counterclaims against the Hotel Tavern remain," Beck said, referring to claims of breach of contract, civil conspiracy, trespass, damage to property, unjust enrichment, abuse of process, libel, slander, permissive waste and fraud, _Ashe Post & Times_ previously reported. "Useless we reach an acceptable agreement to settle our differences, we intend to pursue justice within the court system for these claims and the harm that has been done to us."


  Beck noted he and his team would prefer an "acceptable" settlement so all parties can move on, but is willing to fight to receive what they think is due given the damage to reputation they believe they've received from The Hotel Tavern's actions. He added there's no timetable for the restaurant's removal, saying there will be negotiations "with the hope of a reasonable parting for both parties."


  Now, Beck said he will move forward with his plans to restore the Old Hotel into a functioning hotel. The renovations began March 2, with the removal of the patio. This lead to a temporary restraining order from The Hotel Tavern, as a power shutoff on the building's second floor hampered their ability to conduct business.


  However, electrical problems discovered by the Ashe County Building Inspections Department added another dimension. Beck said that now the lawsuit is out of the way, the project can get back on track.


  "The lawsuit filed by the Hotel Tavern distracted me from working on the restoration, so I am off schedule," Beck said. "Now that the lease claim against me has been proven to be false, I’m going to get back with planning, which includes applying and gaining approval from the NC Historic Preservation office and US Park Service to do the work. These approvals generally take five months or so. Once this is done, we’ll start swinging hammers and the construction work will likely take a couple of years to complete."


  The Old Hotel was sold by the Woodie family to Beck's Bridgetree Investments Aug. 1, 2019, for $800,000.


  The sale led to a complaint from the owners of The Hotel Tavern, Guion & Lyle Enterprises, on Aug. 29, 2019, alleging that Bridgetree, and the Old Hotel’s former owners, conducted unfair and deceptive trade practices and breached their contract, among other claims, _Ashe Post & Times_ previously reported.


  The complaint led to countersuits from both Bridgetree and the Woodie family. In their Oct. 29, 2019, countersuit, the Woodies denied the existence of The Hotel Tavern’s 2018 lease, while also accusing them of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, fraud, conversion, trespass and abuse of process. Bridgtree made accusations against Guion & Lyle Enterprises of breach of contract, civil conspiracy, trespass, damage to property, unjust enrichment, abuse of process, libel, slander, permissive waste and fraud, _Ashe Post & Times_ previously reported.


   _Ashe Post & Times_ will continue to provide updates for this case as they develop.

Supertanker rates are surging again, for a second time this month, as a growing global glut is making more traders and companies look to charter carriers to store oil at sea and sell at a later date to profit from the market structure, shipbrokers tell Reuters. In addition, the Saudi pledge to start flooding the market with oil as early as this week is also driving up freight rates for very large crude carriers VLCCs. Earlier this month, the Saudi-Russian oil price war sent supertanker rates surging as the shipping market felt that there would be a supertanker supply crunch in the coming oil supply deluge. The other reason for sky-high tanker rates was that traders and the trading arms of oil majors are looking to charter tankers for floating storage as the oil market structure has flipped to contango. This is the market situation in which front-month prices are lower than prices in future months, pointing to a crude oil oversupply and making storing oil for future sales profitable.   The contango has further widened in recent days as oil demand everywhere in the world flops, and traders are scrambling to secure storage at sea to profit from the current low oil prices. The run on supertankers during the massive glut and the Saudi supply surge sent supertanker rates for the route from the Middle East to China jumping to $180,000 a day on Monday. That's double from the $90,000 a day rate in the middle of last week, and up from the $125,000 a day rate on Friday, sources at shipbrokers told Reuters. "Almost all the spot [tanker] deals right now have floating storage tied into them - that's the only way to make money. You're not going to make money trading the cargo now," Ashok Sharma, managing director of Singapore-based shipbroker BRS Baxi, told Reuters. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com
