If the City does accrue some savings over the course of this year, the current Tax Stabilization Reserve will be repurposed into a Tax and Community Stabilization Reserve, explained Simpson. This reserve fund would strategically target some assistance into the community for the not-for- profits and others and as much as possible provide some business assistance, such as enhanced marketing or through bulk purchasing of personal protective equipment.

In light of this, the Litigation Chamber of the Belgian DPA concludes that combining the role of department Head with the role of DPO gives rise to a significant conflict of interest. In the case at hand, the Belgian DPA maintains that due to the combination of roles, there is a complete lack of independent DPO oversight concerning the data processing activities taking place in the context of the Compliance, Risk Management and Audit departments. In addition, the Belgian DPA indicates that, due to his dual role, the DPO may not be able to provide sufficient guarantees to the concerned employees in terms of confidentiality and secrecy.

As Wilhelmi led me on a tour of the Ocean View Farms, I was privileged to lay eyes on the most glorious African blue basil I had ever seen. African blue basil is a nearly nonstop flowering shrub whose purplish leaves have a more pungent flavor than the annual basil that is typically used in cooking. But what distinguished this particular plant were its deep violet flowers. Previously, I had only seen the pink flowered African basil but this violet flowered version left me weak-kneed and slack-jawed. African basil is a sterile hybrid that does not produce seeds but is easily propagated from shoot tip cuttings.

While their first team are thriving, though, there is arguably an even more impressive project bubbling under the surface in Bergamo, with the previously unfashionable side beginning to produce some of the very best young players in Italy on a regular basis.
 Last season their Primavera side, or Under-19s, were crowned national champions for the first time in 21 years. The star of that team, playmaker Dejan Kulusevski, joined Juventus in a €35 million (£30m/$39m) deal in January.
 Before the coronavirus-enforced shutdown in Italy brought an end to proceedings, back-to-back titles were very much on the cards. La Dea sit three points clear at the top of the Primavera 1 standings with at least one game in hand on their closest challengers and having lost just one league match all season.
 The likes of Roberto Piccoli, Alessandro Cortinovis and Caleb Okoli have all done their chances of earning first-team opportunities no harm, but there is one player who is attracting widespread interest.
 Amad Traore is already a Serie A history-maker.
 Having stepped off the bench to make his Atalanta debut in the final 13 minutes from the end of October's meeting with Udinese, he picked up the ball around 40 yards from goal before driving forward and unleashing a 20-yard shot from the edge of the area to put the seal on his side's stunning 7-1 victory.
 In doing so, Traore became the youngest player, at 17 years and 109 days old, to score on their Serie A bow, as well as the first player born in 2002 to find the net in the Italian top flight.

In addition to preventing international aid to Iran, we have also seen crocodile tears and false mercy from Trump and his administration, allegedly offering their own coronavirus aid “if Iranians ask for it.” Only someone extremely naive can believe in the sincerity of this offer, considering that they have prevented the aid of other countries, and even stolen medical equipment from Italy, France, Germany and Canada. There is no trace of U.S. aid collection for Iran, which, after all, could have been sent quietly. For example, even though they were in a more difficult situation at the end of March, the Iranians collected medical aid for the American people and sent it through the Swiss Embassy, without media noise. The truth is that Trump had no intention of sending any aid, in fact he just wanted to hear Iranian begging and then use it for propaganda purposes. Of course, Iranians did not bite it and rejected the offer. Still, the fake aid offer and Iran’s refusal were later reported in many Western media as key evidence of U.S. benevolence and Iranian cruelty.

In a weak point guard class, I never understood why Rahsool Diggins wasn’t a more heavily coveted prospect. That changed over the past two weeks, which says something about the state of the game that prospects are receiving offers that they should have enjoyed all along despite things remaining at a stand- still due to the ongoing pandemic.
 Whether it is programs realizing just how thin the 2021 class is, especially for premier lead guard talent, that Diggins is actually this good or that juniors are coming to college decisions much earlier than we have ever seen, the top-50 guard has become a top-level recruit practically overnight.
 Despite the increased attention, Diggins isn't anywhere near his college decision. However, the Villanova offer that he received a few days ago should be noted. Diggins is a Philadelphia native and attends the same high school that Collin Gillespie graduated from and runs with the same travel program that junior commit Nnanna Njoku was slated to appear with this summer. Suffice it to say, there are a lot of connections between the Wildcats and Diggins.
 Look for Diggins to take his recruitment into the fall with visits being made once they’re permissible. Earlier this spring, I would have said DePaul and Virginia Tech were the two to beat. They still might be, but Villanova is definitely one to monitor, as is Kansas, Miami, St. Joe’s and UConn.

Other laid-off workers may decide it's not worth looking for a new job at the moment, given that many businesses remain closed. Others may be too afraid to return to work outside the home for fear of catching the coronavirus disease.


  Yet to be officially counted as unemployed, a fired worker must have actively looked for a job within the last four weeks. "There are lots of folks who will give up as they see large chunks of the economy are on lockdown," Indeed's Bunker said.


  The current labor environment is bleak, with Glassdoor finding that U.S. job listings have plunged 28% since early March. Two in three employers had fewer posted job openings since mid-March, while one in four have pulled down all their job listings, the employment site found.


  Job openings are "down across the board in every industry," Zhao said.


  ## Where do we go from here?


  Recessions typically deliver a hit to the labor market when employers slow their hiring, which makes it more difficult for laid-off workers to find new jobs. Even if the pace of layoffs slows, tens of millions of workers will need to find new jobs for the economy to regain its footing.


  Unemployment may recover in the third quarter, dropping to 11%, as some states relax their social distancing measures and folks return to their reopened workplaces, according to Moody's. But the jobless rate is likely to remain elevated into 2021, it added.

In a time when so many places are closed, and we can't get to our favorite places for vacation or a day out, many parks remain open, giving us an opportunity to get outdoors.      One of those parks that offers a great spring experience is Letchworth State Park in Castile, New York. Known as the Grand Canyon of the East, this park offers plenty of room to distance yourself from others, get exercise and fresh air -- it's an area to escape and relax.      Letchworth offers magnificent views of the Genesee River, which flows through a canyon surrounded by the towering walls. Three waterfalls add to the beautiful scenery. Forests surround the park, and visitors will find 66 miles of hiking trails. The park also offers trails for horseback riding and biking.      Winding park roads follow along the canyon and offer plenty of places to pull off to take in the scenic views. If you want to see the view from a higher vantage point, a hot air balloon ride is the way to do so.      Dozens of waterfalls are in the park. Three of the larger falls are easily accessible and are named Lower Falls, Middle Falls and Upper Falls. Middle and Upper Falls are the most accessible, close to the parking lot and a short walk along wide trails. Lower Falls is worth the short hike to view it.      Lower Falls is located right below Glen Iris Inn, the former home of businessman William Pryor Letchworth, who gifted the property to the state.      The park was established in 1907. Glen Iris sat on 1,000 acres. Over the years, Letchworth opened much of the property to visitors, including a museum. The museum continues to follow the history of Letchworth today.      Fishing, hunting, swimming and picnicking opportunities are abundant. Or just sit in a comfy chair enjoying the outdoors and watching nature go by.      If you are seeking spectacular views of fall foliage, the first two weeks of October is the prime time to visit. If winter is your thing, there is plenty to do -- snow tubing, ice skating, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing or enjoying a horse-drawn carriage ride.      Camp or rent a cabin and explore the park, or venture out to see what the surrounding area has to offer -- first making sure to confirm what's open. Spend a day at Niagara Falls or wander the shop-lined streets of nearby Ellicottville, a small town that is home to Holiday Valley Ski Resort. The resort offers many summer fun things to do as well. Do a little "wineing" in New York's Finger Lakes wine region, and don't miss the Grape Discovery Center in Westfield (grapediscoverycenter.com), reopening once New York's state of emergency has lifted.      Niagara Falls and the city of Salamanca offer casino resorts -- Seneca Niagara and Seneca Allegany. The beautiful city of Buffalo is about 60 miles from the park and offers many things to do, from extensive gardens and sailboat rides to touring Navy ships, world-class restaurants, arts, sports and Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino.      Whatever your definition of fun is, you might just find it at Letchworth State Park and the surrounding areas. Fun and beauty are right on your doorstep when camping or lodging at the Glen Iris Inn in the park.      For more information on the specifics for hunting, fishing, rafting, balloon rides, cabin rental, camping and park rules, visit parks.ny.gov/parks/letchworth or call 585-493-3600.      At this time visit the website to make sure the park continues to remain open and what activities are available. Whether you go now to enjoy time outdoors, take a beautiful drive or wait until a later time when everything is open again, the park won't disappoint.      Letchworth is a "carry in, carry out" park. Whatever you bring into the park, including your picnic trash, you take out of the park. There are no garbage containers.

  # Project Aquamarine


  2021


  |


  Motor Yacht


  Aquamarine is a fast-cruising, all-aluminium motor yacht that sports a brand new hull designed by in-house naval architects, who worked closely with renowned hydrodynamicists Van Oossanen Naval Architects.


   The optimization of the hull design has enabled an efficiency gain of 12%. This important result was achieved by raising the transom and making it sleeker, and in addition, propeller tunnels were incorporated in the hull. This means that the 5000 Aluminium class features raised propellers, which in turn has decreased the draft to just 2.15 meters. Such a shallow draft makes Aquamarine the perfect yacht for cruising in the Bahamas as well as in the crystal clear waters of the Mediterranean. A pair of interceptors will guarantee optimal dynamic trim at high speeds.

Amazing. I was pleased to read in the conclusion to the report that ‘Our study brings into focus the horrific reality of such injuries’, and it very much does. What a gruesome way to go.

  “The only thing I think comes close to Alan’s experience, but I don’t think matches it, is the Sergio Aguero moment where I was in the stadium where they scored two in the last couple of minutes.

The forward's world-record move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 was painted as the Brazil star allowing himself to emerge from Messi’s shadow away from Camp Nou, which in turn would allow him to be considered on the Argentine’s level as he approached his peak years.
 He, of course, has his own Ballon d’Or clause inserted in his contract, though it is one that would see him benefit financially rather than Barca, with PSG set to owe him €3m (£2.6m/$3.2m) if he ever does pick up the prize during his time in the French capital.
 “Having a Ballon d'Or winner in your team adds value to the club and to the brand itself,” high-profile sports lawyer Carlo Brusa told _Le Parisien_ when discussing Neymar and his desire to win the award. “You could expect 45,000 fans attending Parc des Princes during an evening to celebrate Neymar's accomplishment. As a club, it would be an honour to pay such a clause.”
 Of course, things could not have gone more wrong in Neymar’s pursuit of the Ballon d’Or in the city in which the ceremony takes place. Despite collecting five domestic trophies in his first two years at PSG, injuries ruined both campaigns and, in his absence, the team crashed out of the Champions League before the quarter-finals on both occasions.
 So far down the pecking order was the 28-year-old in 2019 that he did not even make the 30-man longlist for the prize, with _France Football_ forced to publish an eight-point list of reasons for why he was not selected. As luck would have it, he likely would be in the running in 2020 had Covid-19 not taken over. Now, his guess is as good as anyone’s as to who might take home the crown.
 Neymar is unlikely to be the last player for whom their pursuit of the Ballon d’Or begins to define their career. Imagine in 10 years' time if any of Mbappe, Sancho or Erling Haaland have not yet picked up the prize having been anointed as future winners by all and sundry upon their emergence at the highest level of the game. There will be others, too.
 Those mentioned above and other teenagers who will step into the limelight in the next handful of years will do so when football has never been more about the celebrity. Ronaldo, of course, is the poster boy for this new generation, with an estimated net worth of £361m ($466m), with Neymar among those attempting to follow in his footsteps.

But pest control is probably its most important function and Wilhelmi agreed with me that nurseries would be wise to situate floating row cover cheek by jowl with popularly used pest control sprays and powders. Application of chemicals, even when they are organic, is never a pleasant undertaking and experienced gardeners avoid this practice it if at all possible. Another problem with chemicals is their storage since, ideally, there should be a separate, ventilated shed utilized for this purpose.

 “They have been the best team in the league this season, so I think a way should be found for the title to be awarded to Liverpool. But I'm not comfortable with the idea of games being played behind closed doors when there's still going to be lockdown measures in place.”
 Plenty of players have stated that they have no issue with Liverpool being awarded the championship and expressed their sympathy that their long-awaited celebrations will be wrecked by the social-distancing measures.

De Gea had initially pushed for an exit during the reign of Van Gaal, before then seeing a fax machine issue prevent him from making a deadline-day switch to Santiago Bernabeu in 2017 – by which time Jose Mourinho was at the Red Devils helm.
 Steele believes that a man who committed to a new four-year contract in September 2019 is happy again in his current surroundings, with any transfer plans having been shelved.
 United’s former goalkeeper coach told the _i paper_: “When he was under Van Gaal we knew the reason why he wanted out – they did not get on, and it didn’t work.
 “He would have gone to Real Madrid if it wasn’t for what happened on transfer deadline day.
 “He was not displeased with the fans or the club, but it was clearly something that had gone on behind the scenes. Now things are different. He has got a smile on his face, the club are improving and I cannot see why he would want to leave.”

In a time when so many places are closed, and we can't get to our favorite places for vacation or a day out, many parks remain open, giving us an opportunity to get outdoors.


  One of those parks that offers a great spring experience is Letchworth State Park in Castile, New York. Known as the Grand Canyon of the East, this park offers plenty of room to distance yourself from others, get exercise and fresh air -- it's an area to escape and relax.


  Letchworth offers magnificent views of the Genesee River, which flows through a canyon surrounded by the towering walls. Three waterfalls add to the beautiful scenery. Forests surround the park, and visitors will find 66 miles of hiking trails. The park also offers trails for horseback riding and biking.


  Winding park roads follow along the canyon and offer plenty of places to pull off to take in the scenic views. If you want to see the view from a higher vantage point, a hot air balloon ride is the way to do so.


  Dozens of waterfalls are in the park. Three of the larger falls are easily accessible and are named Lower Falls, Middle Falls and Upper Falls. Middle and Upper Falls are the most accessible, close to the parking lot and a short walk along wide trails. Lower Falls is worth the short hike to view it.


  Lower Falls is located right below Glen Iris Inn, the former home of businessman William Pryor Letchworth, who gifted the property to the state.


  The park was established in 1907. Glen Iris sat on 1,000 acres. Over the years, Letchworth opened much of the property to visitors, including a museum. The museum continues to follow the history of Letchworth today.


  Fishing, hunting, swimming and picnicking opportunities are abundant. Or just sit in a comfy chair enjoying the outdoors and watching nature go by.


  If you are seeking spectacular views of fall foliage, the first two weeks of October is the prime time to visit. If winter is your thing, there is plenty to do -- snow tubing, ice skating, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing or enjoying a horse-drawn carriage ride.


  Camp or rent a cabin and explore the park, or venture out to see what the surrounding area has to offer -- first making sure to confirm what's open. Spend a day at Niagara Falls or wander the shop-lined streets of nearby Ellicottville, a small town that is home to Holiday Valley Ski Resort. The resort offers many summer fun things to do as well. Do a little "wineing" in New York's Finger Lakes wine region, and don't miss the Grape Discovery Center in Westfield (grapediscoverycenter.com), reopening once New York's state of emergency has lifted.


  Niagara Falls and the city of Salamanca offer casino resorts -- Seneca Niagara and Seneca Allegany. The beautiful city of Buffalo is about 60 miles from the park and offers many things to do, from extensive gardens and sailboat rides to touring Navy ships, world-class restaurants, arts, sports and Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino.


  Whatever your definition of fun is, you might just find it at Letchworth State Park and the surrounding areas. Fun and beauty are right on your doorstep when camping or lodging at the Glen Iris Inn in the park.


  For more information on the specifics for hunting, fishing, rafting, balloon rides, cabin rental, camping and park rules, visit parks.ny.gov/parks/letchworth or call 585-493-3600.


  At this time visit the website to make sure the park continues to remain open and what activities are available. Whether you go now to enjoy time outdoors, take a beautiful drive or wait until a later time when everything is open again, the park won't disappoint.


  Letchworth is a "carry in, carry out" park. Whatever you bring into the park, including your picnic trash, you take out of the park. There are no garbage containers.

"I'm hopeful that I have the antibodies. Do I think I had the virus? I don't know, honestly. Before the shutdown, I was out and about in New York, carefree, taking the subway, going to restaurants and to the theatre, I was living my life fully up until around March 14. So there is a likelihood that I may have had it, and not known it."


  "Regardless of my results, I'm still going to be cautious, and wear a mask and gloves when I go out. But if I do have the antibodies, I think I'll have more peace of mind in terms of taking care of my mom."


  "I would recommend anyone who has the ability to get the test done to take it, it might give you a little peace of mind in an otherwise chaotic time. But I would also say don't hang your happiness and your future on these results. Things will start progressing, and there is hope for everyone. We should all continue to remain diligent and cautious -- because as cheesy as it may sound, we're all in this together."


  On the evening of May 1, Mendez received an email from CityMD directing him to their patient portal to see his results. He tested negative for antibodies, which means he likely never had COVID-19.


  "I took the news with some apprehension, not knowing how to feel about it," Oswald said in an email to Business Insider. "Was I happy because I wasn't exposed, or was I disappointed because I still have to continue to be overly vigilant? Ultimately, these days you can't focus on the what-ifs too much. I'm just going to continue to take care of myself ... (and) focus on my many blessings and how fortunate I am ... Moving onward and upwards, and taking one day at a time."

As Wilhelmi led me on a tour of the Ocean View Farms, I was privileged to lay eyes on the most glorious African blue basil I had ever seen. African blue basil is a nearly nonstop flowering shrub whose purplish leaves have a more pungent flavor than the annual basil that is typically used in cooking. But what distinguished this particular plant were its deep violet flowers. Previously, I had only seen the pink flowered African basil but this violet flowered version left me weak-kneed and slack-jawed. African basil is a sterile hybrid that does not produce seeds but is easily propagated from shoot tip cuttings.

Ortega nods. She says that, apart from the pandemic, it's flu season in Australia. So after she popped out to buy supplies and came home feeling like her throat was a little sore, full-blown anxiety took over. Her immediate concern was whether or not this was something that could potentially be fatal. "I've never felt anything like that before. I broke down and I just cried and said, 'This is it. I'm going to die for going to the grocery store.'" She continues, "Outside of that, it's also grappling with plans you had not happening, or having to adjust so drastically" to events. "Ultimately, this brought us to a better place with Recess. We're still feeling our way because we want to be responsive and responsible. We didn't want to spew so much content without so much thought.

Building level principals and Parent Teacher Organization leaders are creatively recognizing teachers this year due to school closures.


  District administrators indicate an August celebration is scheduled to formally recognize teachers.


  “Teachers are eager to see their students in-person to reassure them that life is good and that they will get through distance learning,” said Ketina Armstrong, communications director.


  She said throughout the school closures, the district’s teachers concentrated on reviewing essential standards for online and paper packet learning, along with focusing on the social and emotional needs of students.


  Carrie Schwierjohn, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction, said throughout this school-closure challenge, the district’s teachers looked for innovative ways to provide learning opportunities to all students.


  “Our teachers attend weekly Zoom meetings to collaborate with each other, and prepare two types of learning for our students. They create both online learning opportunities, using many of the different software and online programs the district purchased, as well as paper copies of traditional learning,” said Schwierjohn.


  She said teachers have done their very best through this difficult time to help students by calling to check on them weekly, providing online tutoring and video lessons, delivering meals and homework, or volunteering to hand out meals or paper copies of schoolwork.


  “We’ve heard from many of our parents that they realize just how much our teachers really do for our students, above and beyond just daily lessons,” said Schwierjohn. “We appreciate all that our teachers do for our students each and every day, but want to express our gratitude and appreciation, especially during Teacher Appreciation Week.”


  Teamwork


  During 2020 Teacher’s Week, appreciation is flowing in all directions as unique teamwork is celebrated.


  “This (pandemic-induced school closure) situation was a learning curve for all of us — and on short notice. But on the whole, everyone adapted very well,” asserted Meagan Thate, Zitzman Elementary teacher and District Teacher of the Year for 2020.


  Thate said teachers and administrators threw their efforts into quickly developing fun learning activities. She added it helped that parents have been working really hard to assist their students in getting the academic work done.


  “This is a crazy situation, but as a whole, we came together so quickly to make sure our families are taken care of. Having the community that we do at MVR and parents that go with the flow while overseeing their children’s learning is amazing. Everyone trusts that all of us have the students’ best interests in mind.


  “Teachers go into this profession because we love education and our kids. It’s been hard on us, too, not seeing our students,” she acknowledged as she contemplated Teacher Appreciation Week.


  “All of my first-graders better come see me on their first day of second grade. I need their hugs,” Thate declared.

One man's dream to spend three years sailing solo around the Pacific nearly turned to disaster after borders started closing around the region, leaving him stranded alone at sea for three months.


  While people around the globe were panic buying and stocking up, he was running low on food and fuel as he sailed between islands trying to find somewhere to dock.


  Wong - he only wanted to share his surname - set off from his home country Singapore on 2 February.


  It was an adventure the 59-year-old experienced sailor had been meticulously planning for years - everything from the exact amount of fuel he would need to the weather conditions of the places he was intending to visit.


  The plan was to sail from Singapore to Polynesia, a journey that would take about four months, in his luxury yacht. Once there, he would spend time exploring the region by land and sea.

For Santa Rosa resident Katy Reihl, the cough that plagued her petite gray cat, Ninja, on and off for the past four years remains a mystery.
 Antibiotics given to her by a veterinarian at the onset of Ninja’s illness weren’t a permanent fix, and a $1,000 worth of tests to find out what was wrong were financially out of reach, said Reihl.
 But when Ninja’s cough appeared to have progressed into something more serious late last month, making it difficult for her to breath, Reihl, 26, made the difficult decision to euthanize Ninja, her companion of 16 years.
 It was a process Reihl hoped could be done at home, though she was concerned that social distancing requirements intended to stop the coronavirus’s spread would make the option difficult to come by.
 “I kept saying to my sister, ‘I wish this wasn’t happening at all, but I really don’t want it to happen right now because I want her to have a peaceful end to her life,’ ” Reihl said.
 After calls to local animal clinics, a mobile veterinarian agreed to squeeze Ninja into his schedule to perform the procedure last week after hearing her symptoms. Instead of giving Ninja the heart-stopping injection inside her home, however, he asked to do the procedure on her front porch. It was one of several precautions he took to protect both himself and Reihl, including separating Reihl from her cat as he gave her the final injection, she said.
 “I feel the way she was able to pass was the best scenario it could have been at this time,” Reihl said.
 Ninja’s procedure is just one example of the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the veterinary profession, a job regarded as an essential business in California during the statewide shelter-in-place orders.
 For example, recommendations by the American Veterinarian Medical Association, the California Veterinary Medical Board and the state’s department of public health all urge veterinarians to limit treatment to clients with urgent and emergency cases during the pandemic.
 The guideline serves as a means to limit the risk of exposure to the virus among veterinary clinic staff and their customers, said Dr. Lisa Schweid, co- owner of Wikiup Veterinary Hospital and president of the Redwood Empire Veterinary Medical Association. Serious cuts, rashes and signs of intestinal issues are types of cases her office is still seeing, while appointments for services like nail-trimming and routine health checks have stopped for the time being, she said. Staff members wear masks throughout their shifts and regularly wash their hands.
 The guideline also reduces the amount of medical supplies and personal protective gear, such as masks and face shields, that veterinarians use during the pandemic, items currently in high demand at hospitals treating people with the coronavirus, Schweid said.
 “Lots of the (personal protective gear) that human hospitals are using are the same that would be used in veterinary procedures,” Schweid said.
 Schweid’s practice implemented a curbside service for the patients she and her staff are treating, a trend she’s seen adopted by veterinarian offices throughout Sonoma County since mid-March, when the local shelter- in-place orders began, she said.

They were playing the same club circuit with their respective bands, Danger Danger and Trixter, when both bands were starting their careers. Over the years, they had a great personal relationship and the idea of doing a record together has been in the cards for many years. With some help from Frontiers the concept became a reality. Rounded out by Greg Smith (Ted Nugent, Rainbow, Alice Cooper) and Chuck Burgi (Rainbow, Blue Oyster Cult, Bon Jovi) on bass and drums, respectively, TMF’s self-titled debut was met with the high praise and enthusiasm one would expect from fans of the genre. The fact that the music delivered was even better than what it looked like on paper has had fans clamoring for a follow-up. And now, with Lions on the way, those fans have much to look forward to!

But the anime-focused botnet, called Cereal, evaded detection for so long because it seemingly served a narrow purpose and used just one exploit, according to Forcepoint.


  "We were also hoping for exceptions amongst the heaps of Anime related requests, but either there is none, or it wasn't routed through our honeypots. We had to conclude that this is either a simplistic Hobby-VPN-Based-Web- Crawler project of someone or there is a hidden agenda behind the scenes that we lack the evidence of," Forcepoint researcher Robert Neumann wrote.


  Forcepoint tracked the botnet back to an IP address in Germany, and noted that the creator's name is logged in some of the malicious code as "Stefan." According to Forcepoint, the anime-harvesting botnet is now on the decline after a different ransomware strain wiped it from most devices in 2019.


  In the past, botnets have been used as weapons to take websites offline. Hackers write malicious code designed to take over internet-connected devices with poor security, then mobilize thousands of zombie devices to request information from a specific server at once, temporarily overwhelming the site in what's known as a DDoS attack.

The closures, which include Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman, and Last Call stores, have been extended to May 31 in light of health and safety concerns, said the company, adding that reopenings will not be affected by the bankruptcy proceedings.      The retailer is continuing sales through its e-commerce sites, and is offering curbside pickup at 10 stores, including all stores in Texas, as well as in Tampa, Las Vegas and at its Tysons Corner store in Virginia.

"The President's insistence on doubling down on his senseless and cruel argument in court to destroy the ACA and every last one of its benefits and protections is unconscionable, particularly in the middle of a pandemic," Pelosi said in a press release.


  As the pandemic raged over the past two months, over 30 million Americans filed for unemployment and caused many to go without health insurance. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated between 25 million and 43 million people could lose their employer-sponsored health insurance.


  The Trump administration has tried weakening the law since it failed to repeal and replace it in 2017, such as by introducing short-term insurance plans that don't cover people with pre-existing conditions or many types of pricey hospital care.


  Eliminating the law could yank health coverage from up to 20 million people, according to a projection from the Urban Institute.

  Severstal gave respirator masks to the police and delivered mobile housing units to quarantine checkpoints. It drafted company employees to join the police on patrols. Its software engineers designed a service to allow the city to monitor quarantine compliance. It said it was procuring 20 ventilators for city hospitals and set aside corporate housing to isolate anyone arriving in the city.

  The Kremlin’s limited relief measures so far have offered little aid to people who are out of work, sparking growing discontent. But in Cherepovets, Severstal has mounted its own emergency relief effort. The company said it would give residents who lost income due to the crisis grocery store gift certificates of about $80 each for every household member. Russia’s minimum wage is about $160 per month.


  “We are responsible for the social stability of the regions where we are present,” Mr. Shevelev said.


  The close involvement of oligarchs in Russia’s coronavirus fight sheds light on their unwritten contract with the Kremlin. Staying in Mr. Putin’s good graces has helped them profit enormously from Russia’s immense natural- resource wealth. Despite years of sanctions and economic stagnation, Russia still has 99 billionaires, according to Forbes, the fifth-most of any country.


  But the oligarchs are also expected to open their coffers to support Mr. Putin’s broader goals, like the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.


  In fact, the oligarchs who have remained in business in Russia since Mr. Putin’s rise have so closely integrated their operations with the state that they are sometimes described not as private businessmen but as division managers in a larger enterprise, “Russia Inc.”


  In past years, Western officials blamed some oligarchs for lending a helping hand in election meddling and military ventures abroad, operating as a shadow hand of the state. Now, the pressing need is controlling the virus.

  In March, the owners of Alfa Bank, Russia’s biggest private bank, donated $13 million to fight the pandemic. The money did not go to charity, but directly to the Russian government’s coronavirus task force.


  “In Russia, the business community — especially big business — traditionally carries out more of a social function than it does in the West,” said Vladimir V. Verkhoshinsky, Alfa Bank’s C.E.O.


  But many executives have found that donating money is not enough, underscoring the weakness of the country’s health system and casting an unflattering light on the Russian government’s lackluster response. On March 14, when Russian officials were still widely playing down the coronavirus threat, Mr. Deripaska called on the government to close the borders and implement a 60-day quarantine. It would be more than two weeks until a nationwide, partial lockdown went into effect.


  In the isolated Arctic city of Norilsk, Mr. Potanin’s Nornickel mining giant took the lead. It procured thousands of testing kits, millions of masks and 46 ventilators for the regions where it operates. It stopped charging rent to dozens of businesses and increased the internet bandwidth it makes available to cellphone operators serving the city of 180,000.


  “It’s necessary to relieve the government of some of its headache,” Mr. Potanin told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.


  One reason the oligarchs’ role is central to Russia’s response is that around 10 percent of the population lives in far-flung “monotowns” like Norilsk that are dominated by a single employer or industry. They are also involved with some of the large, remote construction sites that have emerged as some of the country’s biggest outbreak hot spots.


  For example, more than 1,900 people have tested positive for the coronavirus at the Arctic village of Belokamenka, where the energy giant Novatek is building a liquefied natural gas supply base with thousands of workers crowded into barracks.


  Novatek’s billionaire chief executive, Leonid V. Mikhelson, a prominent player in the global art scene, has kept a low profile during the pandemic, and his company did not respond to a request for comment.

  In the Arctic monotowns of Kirovsk and Apatity, Mr. Guryev, the fertilizer magnate, scrambled to prevent an outbreak when a man who arrived from Cuba tested positive in March. Mr. Guryev dispatched the company jet to pick up 100 testing kits and a specialist, and flew them 1,000 miles to Apatity to examine the patient’s contacts.


  Mr. Guryev’s company, PhosAgro, also said it had bought ambulances, ventilators and personal protective equipment for the medical workers. In some cases, Mr. Guryev said, the public sector cannot act with the necessary urgency — “for them, it’s a bureaucratic process.”


  “For us it’s a same-day decision, often it’s my own personal decision,” Mr. Guryev said. “Buying those tests — I dealt with it personally. I personally dealt with the P.P.E. and I personally dealt with the ventilators, because all this had to be done yesterday.”


  Oleg Matsnev and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.

Three-star wing Casey Simmons likely would have been one of the few trending names after the evaluation periods last month but despite the recruiting shutdown, he still found a way to catch the attention of a number of high- major coaching staffs.
 Simmons’ junior high school season tape shows his improved perimeter jumpshot, his size and length and also his positional versatility.
 Running with the Mass Rivals program, Simmons already held offers from Brown, Northwestern, Penn, Rhode Island, Temple and Yale coming into April, and had taken unofficial visits to Penn, Rhode Island, Temple and Yale within the past year.
 His recruitment took a change for the better last week with offers from Boston College, Georgetown and Texas, and it won’t be long before more high-majors jump into the picture. Miami, Pitt, UConn and Xavier have also expressed interest.
 Simmons is not anywhere near deciding, but he was hoping to take official visits to Northwestern and Penn this spring before the pandemic hit. Once on and off campus recruiting is allowed, Simmons might be one of the more recruited prospects in the region.

On the making of the new album, Steve Brown says, “From day one when I put together Tokyo Motor Fist, I knew that this was a genuine rock group, not a fake cash grab project, a so-called super-group or imaginary band that makes one record and never plays live... TMF is the REAL DEAL! Our debut release proved that, our live shows cemented that fact, and the worldwide response and success to the debut was so overwhelming that a follow-up record was a sure thing. Here we present you with Lions... next level stuff for the band, as you will hear. It’s a great feeling after 30 years of making records to be at the top of my game as a writer, singer, player, and producer. So proud of my band... Ted, Chuck and Greg all delivered incredible performances and took my songs to a higher ground. I brought in my rock 'n roll brother, the great Bruno Ravel, to mix Lions. He is without a doubt one of the most talented all around musicians/producers I know. His expertise and ears took this album over the top. It was mastered by Maor Appelbaum, who did a fantastic job. It sounds brilliant! Lastly, we are on the best label in the business, Frontiers Records! My friend, Serafino Perugino allowed TMF the extra time and the support needed to make the record of our dreams. I can’t wait for you all hear this... Lions is the positive & feel good record the world needs right now... It’s gonna Blow Your Mind!!!”

He decided he would stop at a small island close by instead.


  "It was a small island, only around 20-30 families lived there. There was no telephone, no television, nothing," he said.


  "But even they had heard of the lockdown, so they chased me away. I approached several other islands but they all chased me away.


  "It was then that I got news that the South Pacific islands were all in lockdown, but I was already halfway there - I couldn't really turn back. So I decided to just continue to Tuvalu."


  That leg of the journey would take the next 13 days.


  It was 21 April when he reached Tuvalu. By this time, he had already spent weeks alone on his boat, and his supplies were running dangerously low.


  "My initial plan, if there was no virus, was that I would stop at each country for a while, buy some fuel and food," he said.


  "By this time, the vegetables were all spoilt but I still could keep things like meat and things like potatoes as I had a fridge on board."


  He was about two hours from Tuvalu waters when he was discovered by maritime officials - who again, told him to leave.


  "I pleaded with them and said 'Please, I don't have any more fuel and food. I won't anchor and step on land, just let me stay in your waters,'" he said.


  But they said no.


  "I said I didn't have anywhere to go and they said to head back to the ocean. At last I said ok at least help me buy some food and fuel."


  He passed them nearly US$1,400 (£1,133) in exchange for 1,000 litres of diesel and approximately a month's worth of food.

Kelly, 32, and 21-year-old Anna – who met and became friends after working as freelance make-up artists in another salon – decided to launch a business a year ago.


  With years of experience in photoshoots and e-commerce, as well as bespoke eyebrow training, the girls decided to invest in their hometown.


  “Just by working together, Kelly and I became really close, and decided that we shared the same ideas for the future – and that is how Vanilla was launched,” explained Anna. “Our idea was to bring a new scene not only to Rutherglen, but to Scotland, by offering a make-up academy course online, as well as face-to-face.


  “Since we came up with the concept, we knew Vanilla was always going to be charitable and the launch party we had planned for our clients involved raising money.


  “So, we decided to make light of the situation and do our own wee bit to give back. Although we are unable to work from the salon momentarily, we have turned a bad situation into a very positive one.”

Budget airline backer Bill Franke, who pioneered rock-bottom fares topped up by optional charges, says slashing prices alone will not be enough to get people flying again as carriers try to inch back to profitability after the coronavirus shutdown.


  Airlines will need to make passengers feel their health is secure before they get back on planes as the economy slowly stirs back to life, he told Reuters.


  "In the early days the passenger won't be motivated by the price of the ticket. They'll be motivated in large part by their own personal safety," said Franke, whose investment firm is the driving force behind several low-cost carriers worldwide.


  "The traditional 'we'll just sell seats cheap' - it doesn't really work here," said Franke, chairman of U.S. budget carrier Frontier Airlines, Chile's JetSmart and Hungarian Wizz Air .


  The co-founder of private equity firm Indigo Partners, which has thrown its weight behind the practice of "unbundling" fares to let people pay only for what they use, is also a board member of Mexico's Volaris Airlines and chairs a Canadian startup.


  Airlines around the world are struggling with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought air travel to a virtual standstill. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates $314 billion in lost passenger revenue for global airlines this year.


  U.S. airlines are collectively burning more than $10 billion in cash a month, according to industry trade group Airlines for America.


  Franke said the early objective for airlines' financial recovery will be to break even on cash flow, which means recouping immediate expenses.


  "Then to start creating profitability - some increment above the cash required to pay the bills, and eventually trying to work your way back to the demand we saw in 2019. My view is that it will take 1.5-2 years to get back," he said in a recent interview.


  He added that over time, airlines will move back toward traditional fare models in which pricing depends on local markets and competition.


  "But that's not going to motivate passengers at the front end of this crisis."


  "Generally passengers will be more concerned about their personal safety than whether the flight costs $50 or $60. That sense of well-being, of safety, has to be developed," he said.


  Executives at traditional U.S. airlines have also said the desire to travel will not return until people perceive it is safe, regardless of fares.


  That stance contrasts with Europe's largest low-cost carrier, RyanAir, whose boss, Michael O'Leary, told Reuters last month that traditional price-cutting would stimulate demand provided passengers wore masks and airports carried out checks.


  RyanAir competes for tourist traffic with Franke's Wizz Air.


  MIDDLE SEATS


  U.S. airlines say they have stepped up cabin cleaning and air filtration systems and are requiring all passengers to wear masks or coverings.


  Some have also taken steps to leave middle seats open or restrict ticket sales.


  Those moves are part of a broader rethink on how to limit the spread of the new coronavirus during air travel.


  While airlines generally support masks, leaving middle seats empty has triggered a debate about the effectiveness in protecting health, with global airlines body IATA coming out against the idea.


  "The hard economic facts are you can do that to a point," said Franke. "If I'm trying to get passengers back on the airplane, early days I can do that, but it is not a path to economic success."


  Depending on the airline, most carriers need to fly 50-60% full to recover their cash costs, he said.


  "At the end of the day, like every other business, an airline has to have more money coming in the door than going out the door, and you can't operate with half your seats empty." (Reporting by Tracy Rucinski in Chicago Editing by Tim Hepher and Matthew Lewis)

That’s a very grim way to go. I’m always amazed at how much detail osteologists can draw from bone analysis. I was struck by the fact that the paper states that the arrow was probably spinning in a clockwise motion as it entered the skull; in other words, it was designed to spin to maintain its speed and accuracy, much as a modern gun bullet does (also clockwise – I don’t know if that is simply a reflection of gun manufacturers following past practice with arrow fletchers).

He is the cofounder of New Majority Ready, a business strategy and marketing consulting company that specializes in helping companies realize the power of multicultural customers.


  He currently lives in an apartment near Union Square in lower Manhattan, an area of the country that has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.


  Mendez has been closely following the latest updates about the pandemic, including the recent rollouts of antibody tests which show that one in five New York City residents are testing positive for coronavirus antibodies, indicating that they may have unknowingly been infected many weeks ago and have since recovered.


  Mendez had experienced minor colds in early March, but showed no other symptoms. Still, living in such a high-risk area and knowing of several people who had gotten sick, he wondered if he had maybe contracted the virus unknowingly, and been asymptomatic. With his 76-year-old mother coming to stay with him from his brother's home in New Jersey in mid-May, Mendez wanted to take every precaution possible for her safety.

If you thought knitting was just for grannies, you'd be mistaken.


  You can find plenty of online knitting happy hours, and you've undoubtedly seen young people knitting on their commutes. Now that people are finding themselves with extra time on their hands at home, it's not surprising that knitting has become even more popular.


  We Are Knitters was founded in 2011 after founders Pepita Marin and Alberto Bravo visited NYC and noticed young people around the city knitting and that colorful yarns and fabrics were easily available. "Nothing like that was happening in Spain," Bravo tells Insider Reviews over email. "Quite the opposite, to be honest. We thought that if it was a trend in the US, it would become popular in Europe in about two to three years." Marin and Bravo thought it looked like a fun hobby and started the company after teaching themselves to knit from YouTube videos.


  They now have headquarters around the world and sell internationally; Bravo estimates they sold around 100,000 knitting kits last year, with blankets and snoods (also known as infinity scarves) being the most popular. He attributes this to the peacefulness that comes from making something with one's hands. "To see that you are able to create a scarf with your hands, wear it, or even gift it to someone is very satisfying," he says. "A lot of people knit not because they need a new sweater or a beanie, but because they find it relaxing and it helps them destress. Some even call it the '21st-century yoga.'"

The irony is that stimulus given to citizens across the board is a rather dull weapon in that some will need to spend the funds in order to survive while others won't spend any more at all: all they're doing is buying food anyway given how our necessarily wise confinement restricts our other spending opportunities. Municipalities are one very sure place to put federal funds where one knows they will go into spending -- and much spending for the public good, especially in these times. In short, government at all levels can and should spend in a stimulus way when many people can't or won't.

The leader of the U.N. said Wednesday the 1 billion people living with disabilities around the world have been among the hardest-hit by the virus. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for them to have equal access to prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as the pandemic exposes and intensified global inequalities.


  In the U.S., a number of states are moving toward reopening businesses shuttered by the virus, but many people with disabilities are staying behind closed doors, worried that more interaction could lead to a wave of new infections.


  “It’s honestly kind of scary, with my disability even the common sniffles could put me in the hospital,” said Hansen, who usually likes volunteering at the library and rubbing shoulders with superheros at Comic-Con.


  Hansen, 20, has done well with a new medication and was ready to start a grocery-store job near his Utah home before the virus hit, but the infection risk has put a stop to that for now. He used to have help from health-care workers with things like eating and bathing, but they had to stop coming after one had a potential exposure. The coronavirus test turned out to be negative, but they decided the risk was too high. Now Jodi Hansen does most of those things for her son, bringing drinks, scratching itches and bathing him, even though she has a bad shoulder and is working 40 hours a week from home as a transition coordinator for the Utah Parent Center.


  “I’ve definitely had one full panic attack,” said Jodi Hansen. “I look at my eyes in the morning. I’ve got bad undereye circles. I just don’t sleep well at all.”


  Oklahoma mom Lisa DeBolt felt like she had to make a similar decision in caring for her son Chandler, who also has cerebral palsy. While her husband works in facilities management for a church, she’s helping with things like medication, hygiene and a feeding pump.


  “We just have such a small little family to rely on right now,” she said.


  Both moms worry not only about how the virus might affect their sons but how a hospital stay might unfold.

I congratulate those boards that have made it clear that this is their general approach and hope that all can take a similar view.

FILE - In this Feb. 3, 2020 file photo NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaks during a news conference in Miami. The NFL has set protocols for reopening team facilities and has told the 32 teams to have them in place by May 15. In a memo sent by Goodell and obtained Wednesday, May 6, 2020 by The Associated Press, several phases of the protocols were laid out. The first phase would involve a limited number of non-player personnel, initially 50 percent of the non-player employees (up to a total of 75) on any single day, being approved to be at the facility. But state or local regulations could require a lower number. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, file)

The Metamora Farmer’s Market (www.Facebook.com/MetamoraFarmersMarket) will open June 6 across from the historic courthouse, according to David “DJ” Wohlert, Jr., market president. “We are still in discussion about exactly how we are going to operate. It’s definitely a daunting task, but we hope to open as usual with a few different _modus operandi_ to go by,” said Wohlert. “Every Saturday we see at least 100 to 150 people. When produce is in full swing in late summer, we have more than that.”

The process begins when a person pulls into the parking lot of her office and phones staff to let them know they’ve arrived for their pet’s appointment. Masked veterinary technicians then collect medical history and information about the pet’s visit curbside, while the person is in their car, before bringing the animal inside the building for their exam. After the exam, the veterinarian who saw the pet either calls or meets with their owner outside to debrief them about what happened during the exam and the next steps.
 Dr. Shannon Cloninger, co-owner of Sebastopol’s Analy Veterinary Hospital, is also using curbside service. While it was important to minimize the risk in contracting the virus among her staff, there were some downsides to the new process, because veterinarians can gain helpful insight from talking with the pet’s owner face to face during an examination. Those meetings often serve as an opportunity for veterinarians to share crucial information that help clients better understand their pet’s ailment.
 “We spend a lot of time in exam rooms drawing pictures, or running to a computer to pull up a picture,” Cloninger said. “We don’t have access to that now.”
 Cloninger also noted that, unlike the use of telemedicine for human patients, which has seen a surge since the pandemic began, regulations by the California Veterinary Medical Board on virtual examinations have made it difficult for veterinarians in the state to take advantage of the technology in the same way, Cloninger said.
 The current rules allow veterinarians to treat patients over phone or video only if they’ve examined pets in the past year, and only for the same issue, she said.
 “If I saw a dog six months ago for an ear infection but now it’s limping, I cannot do the (virtual) exam,” Cloninger said. “Telemedicine, in my opinion, has some limits, but right now it would be nice to be able to use it more than we do.”
 Both practices have seen a decrease in business since the local shelter-in- place order took effect March 18, most likely a result of restrictions around nonurgent or emergency services, Cloninger and Schweid said.
 Schweid estimated the number of appointments they have on any given day has dropped by about 20% compared to before the pandemic.
 At the Analy Veterinary Hospital, veterinarians have cut down the number of days they work per week from four to three due to a decline in appointments.
 “We have been able to keep everyone employed,” Cloninger said of her staff. “But I have a lot of friends who have had to lay off their staff.”

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday removed jail as a punishment for violating his coronavirus restrictions following outcry by conservatives over a Dallas salon owner who was jailed for refusing to keep her business closed.


  Abbott said his new order should free Shelley Luther, who was booked in the Dallas County jail this week for keeping her salon open in defiance of the governor’s restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus.


  Luther refused to apologize for repeatedly flouting the order, leading a judge to find her in contempt of court and sentence her to a week behind bars.


  “Throwing Texans in jail who have had their businesses shut down through no fault of their own is nonsensical, and I will not allow it to happen,” Abbott said in a statement.

After my kids left the nest, I went from cooking every night for four people to cooking every night for just my husband and myself. And when I say cooking every night, I actually mean, eating out twice a week, ordering in three times a week, and cooking twice. Actually, I'd cook only once, because the second time we'd have leftovers.      But then we all got quarantined and suddenly I was making three meals a day every day for the two of us for what felt like a year. My husband of course, didn't see anything wrong with this, while I felt like I'd become a short- order cook.      So, when my husband asked me a simple question for the ninety-fifth hundredth time, I kind of lost my mind.      "Hey honey, what's for dinner?" he said.      "Aauugghh!" I yelled and ran into the bathroom. I needed to be alone with my thoughts. There weren't many. It was mostly that I didn't want to make dinner again.      The problem wasn't so much that I had to cook. The problem was what I had to cook with. While other people had bought rolls and rolls of toilet paper for the quarantine, I had stocked up on beans. Apparently, for no reason whatsoever, I was convinced that a pandemic would lead to a shortage of beans, so I panicked and bought a dozen or so cans. But in my bean-induced confusion, I hit the wrong button and instead of ordering a few cans, I ordered a case, and when it arrived, I was the proud owner of 50 cans of beans.      Beside having nowhere to store 50 cans of beans, I had another problem. When I was ordering my beans, I failed to take into account the fact that my family has not historically done too well with beans, and there existed the very real possibility that if I served too many meals made of beans, we would probably, in no uncertain terms, blow up.      This was not something I was guessing at. This was a known fact. Having made chili before, I knew what effects the beans had on my family, and let's just say that there isn't enough Febreeze in the world to overcome what my family let loose. There was a time, once, where I was pretty sure we were to blame for a massive hole in the Earth's ozone that had formed after we had dinner on Chili night.      Then, that weekend, we took our leftovers with us when we went skiing. The next day, I swear we all skied 50% faster because of our "tailwind."      The kids, naturally, found all this hilarious. My husband and I … not so much. At some point, I tried giving everyone some of those natural digestive enzymes they sell in the store for just such a problem. It was clear they didn't help when the gas company showed up at our door after the neighbors reported smelling something noxious coming from our house.      Knowing that the beans posed a serious threat to our comfort, and quite possibly my marriage, I needed to find a way to cook them so neither of us would have a problem. I scoured the internet and discovered that soaking and rinsing the beans prior to cooking, even canned beans, would help a lot.      So, one night I tested the theory and made a batch of Black Bean Sloppy Joes. The rinsing seemed to do the trick for me and I felt no gaseous side effects after dinner. But as we sat on the couch later, I suddenly smelled something so bad it singed my nose hairs.      "Was that you?" I asked my husband as I smothered my face with a pillow.      "No," he said, pulling his shirt up over his nose. "You?"      I shook my head. We both looked down at the dog asleep on the floor.   "Hmmm," I said. "Guess I won't be putting any more beans in his food."   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.

He'll make his bones in his own zone but in his prime will contribute 40-50 points per season in the NHL, and has a good enough shot from the point to man the second power-play unit. He's rising up draft boards recently so he may be unavailable to the Caps.

It is now the second major retailer to file for bankruptcy protection during the pandemic, following fashion brand J.Crew's filing earlier this week.


  A number of other major retailers may have to follow suit in the near future. Gap Inc. has warned it is running out of cash and is looking for an infusion and J.C. Penney is facing problems as well.


  The new coronavirus forced the Dallas-based retailer to close all 43 of its stores in March, the New York Times reported. The company said Thursday that the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process will not impact the timing of store re- openings.


  Shortly after its bankruptcy announcement, Neiman Marcus shared a message to customers that explained Thursday's move is "not a liquidation of our business."


  "Neiman Marcus has always focused on delivering the most exceptional and personal luxury experiences, and we are proud of our history which spans over 100 years. But the unprecedented global crisis from the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately made it impossible to continue to service our debt and maintain normal operations," the Neiman Marcus Group said in a tweet.

Enterprises with a higher employee count require a large and complex communication set up to work efficiently. Moreover, with server hosting services, the efforts required to set up new equipment for business communication has drastically reduced. With increasing enterprise sizes, the need for robust communication tools has also increased. These factors have led to an increase in demand for server hosting services.

I had just recently returned to work at full capacity after a yearlong recovery from hitting my head when slipping on ice in my driveway (the perils of Vermont living). I was almost completely back to no symptoms.


  Then, like so many of us, when COVID-19 hit, I joined the world in extra screen time. Zoom meetings for work, FaceTime and texting for connecting with friends and family, keeping up with the news, Facebook, a touch of entertainment, and supporting our children with their online learning. Two extra screens were added into the mix at our home from the elementary school.

The coronavirus pandemic has caused a shift in consumer spending behavior toward e-commerce. But as merchants look toward a post-COVID world, they're looking for ways to make best use of their real estate footprints and link their in-store and online sales.


  Buy now, pay later startups, too, are riding this wave of connecting the online and in-store experiences. Over the past few years, startups like Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, and QuadPay have come on the scene offering shoppers the option to split their e-commerce purchases into installment payments. And they all got their start by partnering with merchants to embed their product in online checkout windows.


  Buy now, pay later startup QuadPay has now launched a new way for its users to shop at almost any store and pay for their purchases in installments as a way to grow its customer base outside of e-commerce.


  To offer on-demand access to installment payments, QuadPay's app issues single-use digital cards that its customers then use to pay in-store. And behind the scenes, payments giant Stripe is powering the tech that enables instant card issuing and payment.

The Sanders campaign decried the initial decision to end the election as "a blow to democracy." Though Sanders suspended his presidential campaign in April as former Vice President Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee, he remains on the ballot to continue to rack up delegates for the party's convention.


  In her court ruling Tuesday, allowing the election to move forward, US District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan called the initial cancellation unconstitutional.


  "If all but one of the presidential candidates are removed from the ballot and the primary is not held, Delegate Plaintiffs will be deprived of the opportunity to compete for delegate slots and shape the course of events at the Convention, and voters will lose the chance to express their support for delegates who share their views," Torres wrote. "The loss of these First Amendment rights is a heavy hardship."


  Douglas Kellner, co-chairman of the board and one of the defendants in the lawsuit, said last month that there was no reason to hold the presidential primary, since Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8.

But pest control is probably its most important function and Wilhelmi agreed with me that nurseries would be wise to situate floating row cover cheek by jowl with popularly used pest control sprays and powders. Application of chemicals, even when they are organic, is never a pleasant undertaking and experienced gardeners avoid this practice it if at all possible. Another problem with chemicals is their storage since, ideally, there should be a separate, ventilated shed utilized for this purpose.
