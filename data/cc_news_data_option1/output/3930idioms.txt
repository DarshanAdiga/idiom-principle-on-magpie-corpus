 # Mother passes African American Cultural Arts and History Center legacy to daughter
 Dean-Paul Stephens
 Times-News
 One would imagine the presence of certain pressure among those tasked with taking over a organization, doubly so if the prior boss was a parent. But, if Shineece Sellars is any indication, there are exceptions to every rule.
 A longtime Burlington resident, Sellars recently became the executive director of the African American Cultural Arts and History Center, a nonprofit founded by none other than her mother, Jane Sellars.
 "Its surprising, I don’t feel pressure at all,” Shineece Sellars said. “The biggest pressure, for me, is balancing everything that I have going on. My mom did such a good job in the initial work that carrying a torch seemed natural to me.”
 Sellars, who has been involved with her mother’s organization since the beginning, believes that she was groomed to take over her mother's work, which is what she did at the beginning of July. Since then she has overseen the organization’s historical and genealogical mission.
 "Our goal is to preserve and educate on the local African American history,” Shineece Sellars said. “A lot of things that we have done in the past have been recognizing the phenomenal men and women in the community that have contributed to the community.”
 The nonprofit also preserves historical and genealogical documents for the next generation.
 “Locally … what we have done is partner with Elon University, we’ve partnered with the Sheriff’s Office and addressed the divide between them and the African American community."
 While the center first earned its nonprofit status in 2017, the work behind it started years prior.
 “I was probably in middle school,” Sellars said about when her mother first started work on the center. “I’m 28, now. She put a pause on her research after my grandfather passed away. I still have all the books that she put together.”
 It’s largely because of this experience, Jane Sellars already had an inkling of the kind of work she wanted her center to pursue. Before the organization, Jane Sellars spent countless hours putting together the genealogical record of her family.
 “My mom was big on history, she was the genealogist of the family,” Shineece Sellars said. “She would keep records of our family and put together books to show where everybody came from. Her research started to, somewhat, bleed out into the community.”
 The desire to do this for other families was one of the motivating factors behind Jane Sellars’ effort to start her nonprofit.
 “We call ourselves a center and not a museum, although people in the community might call us the Black museum or African American,” Shineece Sellars said. “We had a museum concept, but that wasn’t the only piece to the vision. One thing my mom wanted was a place for people to come in and come do DNA testing and get their results.”
 Both Sellarses also would like to include a small library featuring works by African American authors.
 “We want to have books by Black people on Black people so people can read more about their own culture,” Shineece Sellars said. “My mother was a psychology major, so for her, it is about discovering yourself.”
 This vision is still very much in play. Currently, Shineece Sellars is in the process of finding a physical home to house the center, something that proved elusive when her mother first got things started.
 Years later and their prospects of finding a physical home has improved. She hopes to be able to make a move soon, given that there is already interest in the center.
 Shineece Sellars said she hopes the community would be able to lend a hand, especially given the center’s potential to draw tourists. Shineece Sellars has big hopes for the center over the next five years. She said she hopes that the center will be located in a sufficiently large space, while helping people discover themselves.

“There was preparation I didn’t expect, but it certainly turned out to be worth it,” Scollans said. While her tub offers enjoyment, it’s also a critical element of her self-care routine — in non-pandemic times, she has a long commute to Boston that affects her back and heightens stress. “You can come home after a long day and just jump in the tub and take a half-hour to piece your brain back to together.”
 Lately, a lot of locals have been dreaming of doing just that.
 “This year’s been a little different,” said Tannah Fletcher of Clearwater Pool & Spa of Keene. “With a lot of people stuck at home, they’re wanting pools and spas.”
 Though the store saw a busy summer, it is still well-stocked with spas. “People have actually been coming here because they can get a hot tub,” Fletcher said, noting that numerous other stores have exhausted their inventory as a result of factory disruptions and backorders. The shoppers she works with have a range of reasons behind their interest in tubs.
 “A lot of people want all the bells and whistles,” she said. “Other people don’t care because they just want the bubbles,” she explained.
 The various spa lines at the store have something to suit either mindset, and everything between. Each brand offers basic, midline and luxury models. Factors such as jet quality and number, warranty length, and built-in entertainment options (sound systems and TVs) all affect pricing.
 For those just delving in and wondering whether fall is too late to purchase a tub, Fletcher says, “This time of year is great.” The weather is perfect, and there’s still time before the snow flies. Plus, the hydrotherapy spas offer an excellent remedy for myriad physical issues that crop up as a result of winter activities, including snow shoveling, as well as seasonal sports, like skiing and skating.
 “We actually just started carrying a CBD line, and it’s quite inexpensive,” Fletcher said. Clearwater is also known for its selection of spa aromatherapy products, including popular scented salts. In addition, many rely on the store’s chemical alternatives, such as natural enzymes, to use in place of chlorine.
 So, if you find yourself dreading the colder seasons ahead, perhaps now is the right time to dip your toe in the water. Whether you’re drawn to a spa that’s rustic, contemporary, therapeutic or just plain fun, it can have a lifestyle impact that lasts.

CD Projekt Red has released a new commercial for Cyberpunk 2077 featuring Johnny Silverhand himself, Keanu Reeves.
 The 30 second trailer sees Keanu Reeves in the flesh rather than his digital Silverhand form, dressed up in a suit and stating that you're only a criminal in 2077 if you get caught. We see flashes of cinematic scenes in Night City throughout the teaser, where Reeves says you "can be anyone, anything... if your body can pay the price."
 This of course isn't the first time we've seen Reeves pop up in a Cyberpunk 2077 video since he'll be playing a central role in the upcoming RPG. You can even get a figure of Reeves as Silverhand to sit on your desk for $900. Complete with full rocker garb such as his shades and guitar, the PureArts figure is fitted with an LCD backdrop equipped with a speaker, so it'll also play music and display screensavers from the game.
 The commercial comes shortly after the most recent Night City Wire stream in September, which gave us a look at _the gangs of Night City_. The event revealed that you as the player won't be able to join any of the gangs, but you'll be encountering them as you venture through the different territories of the Cyberpunk world.
 Set to land on PS4, Xbox One, and PC on November 19, the end of the commercial also states that it'll "plays great also on Xbox Series X and PS5". Back in June, CD Projekt Red confirmed that _Cyberpunk 2077 will get a free next-gen upgrade_ for PS5 and Xbox Series X for anyone who owns a copy on PS4 or Xbox One.

ING Neo will instead be headed by Annerie Vreugdenhil, the bank's current head of wholesale banking innovation.      In a statement, the bank says the realignment is intended to "increase the speed and impact of our performance".      ING has been seen a front-runner in the innovation arena under the leadership of former CEO Ralph Hamer and his 'Think Forward' digital strategy. Hamer quit the Dutch lender in Feburary to join UBS, taking up his new role at the beginning of September.
