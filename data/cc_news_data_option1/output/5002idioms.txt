It almost sounds like the priorities of these highly-complex German car companies were simply out of line. They chose to do the fun stuff first instead of focusing on the real task at hand: Getting gas cars off the road and putting electric ones on it. Instead of worrying about the issues surrounding the manufacturing processes of EVs, which took Tesla several years to figure out (and it is still a work in progress), BMW will be forced to make a full-scale commitment if it wants to be competitive within the next ten years. The decision it made could be detrimental to the future development of the company's EV fleet. It certainly has its work cut out for it.

Kilwinning looked vulnerable at set pieces, Breslin illustrating the point by flashing a header just wide of the target from a corner.
 The pressure was mounting on the hosts and it wasn't too much of a surprise when an equaliser arrived in the 26th minute.
 Ryan Murney latched onto a loose ball on the edge of the penalty area and curled a stunning strike into the bottom corner, giving Barclay no chance.
 Barclay was seeing more of the ball than Kilwinning's forwards and he had to make a smart save down low to his right to keep out a long range effort in 32 minutes.
 Cumbernauld looked in control but they were dealt a massive blow in the 35th minute when Breslin was given his marching orders.

Unlike last season, Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego won't default to giving youth the nod in all close playing-time decisions.
 Going into the 2019-20 season, Borrego told the Observer he'd lean toward young guys over veterans in close calls. He did just that, devoting nearly 50% of the playing time to six guys in their first or second NBA seasons.
 Borrego said Saturday he still views the Hornets in a development stage. However, the additions of free agent Gordon Hayward and high-pick rookie LaMelo Ball have upped the talent base, and youth will no longer automatically get preference for minutes.
 "This year is going to be about, 'You earn your time, whether you're a young guy or a veteran,'" Borrego said Saturday, in response to a specific question from the Observer about playing-time mix.
 "I want to continue to get our (young) guys better, but I'm not driven by that right now," Borrego added. "I just want to find the best combinations. Overall, I'm going to play anybody who is ready to go on any given night."

She starts by reviewing history written predominantly from the perspective of men that show the emphasis on holding power at all costs through fear and deception, arrogance, attack and annihilation of those who get in the way. In one table, she contrasts the old story of power with doing power differently. For example: 1. Strong/ weak hierarchy model replaced with a partnership model. 2. Authoritarian replaced with interactive. 3. Collaborates competitively replaced with collaborates connectively. 4. Values individualism, fortitude and action replaced with values relationships, empathy and communication. 5. Witholds praise and encouragement replaced with generous with praise and encouragement. 6. Denies one's own mistakes and vulnerability replaced with transparent about mistakes and vulnerability 7. Dominates, interrupts, overrides replaced with listens, processes and includes.

Nothing, except in the Finchers' imaginations. _The Jungle_ journalist was the Bernie Sanders of the Great Depression, a popular progressive who was poised to win the California governorship in 1934 before Hearst teamed with MGM's Irving Thalberg to defame Sinclair with fake newsreels touting him as a hero to commies, morons, and hobos. Fincher speculates that Sinclair's failed campaign spurred Mankiewicz's vengeance against powerful bullies. To twist the knife, _Mank_ invents two major plot points: First, that Mankiewicz gave Thalberg the idea to hire paid actors to play "real" Sinclair voters--"You can make people believe that King Kong is 10 stories tall"--and second, that Mankiewicz's fictitious friend Shelly Metcalf directs the newsreels and immediately commits suicide in guilt. (The actual director, Felix E. Feist, enjoyed a career bump that stretched for decades.) Besides, Mankiewicz was no fan of unions. He railed against the Screen Writers Guild until he dragged it into his fight to get credit on _Citizen Kane_.
 ## While we're talking vintage gossip, Marion Davies was better--and worse-- than _Kane_ 's failed soprano Susan Alexander.

Seyfried gets that warning across with one sharp glare javelined at Oldman's Mankiewicz before he pukes on the carpet at San Simeon. To Fincher, that scene was so crucial he shot over 100 takes. It felt "like _Groundhog 's Day_," Seyfried recently said to _Total Film_. Still, Mankiewicz was a popular--if risky--guest who drizzled bon mots, and bodily fluids, at tinsel town's swankiest gatherings. On low key nights, he'd barge into friends' houses, help himself to corned beef, pudding, and scotch, and, as a night cap, comb their medicine cabinet. His raccoon raids were so notorious (and habitual) that he trained himself to swallow a pilfered sleeping pill right before he bid adieu, so that he, and his car, would shut down as soon as he pulled into his driveway. Eventually, Mankiewicz printed a sheaf of fill-in-the-blank apology notes for his hangovers: "Dear _____, I want to thank you for the lovely _____ I spent at your home."

Let’s face it, this year has been a struggle for so many people in more ways than one. Thoughts of kids, the holidays and wondering how to provide for them may also be weighing heavily on many. But take heart, Santa and the Postal Service are way ahead of you, and are here to help.
 The USPS Operation Santa program celebrates its 108th year in 2020 by opening up for nationwide participation. Now, more than ever, the program is needed to help less fortunate kids and families during the holidays.
 The Postal Service established the USPS Operation Santa program to help those in need at the holidays experience the joy of opening presents — and to create special holiday memories. Since it began, millions of less fortunate children and their families have been helped by the kindness of others. The program is for every person of every belief, or non-belief. The purpose is to help as many deserving families as possible. And that can only be done if good-hearted adopters step forward.
 To participate in the USPS Operation Santa program as a possible recipient of holiday gifts, all that has to be done is write a letter, put it in a stamped envelope with a return address, and send it to Santa’s official workshop address at Santa Claus, 123 Elf Road, North Pole, 88888. Letters will be accepted Nov. 16 – Dec. 15.
