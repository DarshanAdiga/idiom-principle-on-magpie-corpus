Australia were expected to face the spin challenge during their 1994 Tour of Pakistan. However, it was Akram's blistering pace bowling which troubled them in the first Test. He took three crucial wickets in the first innings of the game and put the visitors on backfoot. However, his best show came in the third innings where he claimed a five-wicket haul and played a crucial role in his side's one-wicket triumph.

The left-arm pacer was among those rare breed of cricketers who made their international debut before playing First-Class cricket. Despite that, he burst onto the scenes with some incredible performances. Along with Waqar Younis, the talismanic pacer formed a lethal bowling pair. Akram was also the highest wicket taker of 1992 World Cup and played a key role in guiding Pakistan to the title. Speaking of his numbers, the former pace sensation scalped 414 and 502 wickets in 104 Tests and 356 ODIs respectively. Now, let's focus on some of his best performances.

_RRR_ is a period drama that revolves around the freedom fighters, Komaram Bheem and Alluri Seetharamaraju in the pre-Independence era. While we have already seen the first look of Ram Charan, fans were excited to see and Jr NTR's look on his birthday but due to lockdown it couldn't be released. With RRR's shooting, Rajamouli and team can certainly set an example for other film crews on how to work keeping in mind the social distancing guidleines and we can't wait to see how the RRR team will manage that.

Akram made an impeccable use of the red cherry in the third Test of Pakistan's 2000 Tour of West Indies and rattled the Carribbean batting line- up. The veteran pacer brilliantly exploited the reverse swing from the Antigua track and took six wickets in the second innings. He continued his impressive form in the last innings of the game too where he took yet another five-wicket haul. His efforts, however, went in vain as the home team clinched the match by one wicket.

The opposition batsmen failed to tackle Akram's vicious deliveries as the pacer took six wickets in the second innings. His efforts proved to be fruitful as the home team went on to win the game by 186 runs.
