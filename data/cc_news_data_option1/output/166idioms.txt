WILLY THE RAM (Trap 1) - 18.55 Sheffield
 WILLY THE RAM was hit hard by the grader on the back of a facile debut success at Swindon back in November, yet, to his credit, he displayed he was a further improved model when landing his last competitive start at the same venue last month. His trials around Owlerton have been solid as opposed to spectacular but he promises to improve further and, debuting in A6 grade we're confident he can take another step forward and emerge victorious.
 INCA CONEY (Trap 4) - 19.09 Sheffield
 INCA CONEY is clearly a very forward youngster, highlighted by her very slick exits from the boxes over four bends in recent weeks. In truth, the 500-metre trip was looking at the limit of her stamina. However, she's been impressive for the switch to sprinting, again displaying a fine burst of early speed to land a maiden contest seven days ago. Being a June whelp she can be expected to come forward again as she gains further experience and we're hopeful she can come home in front again taking on her fellow youngsters.
 THE OTHER REX (Trap 6) - 19.26 Sheffield
 THE OTHER REX was pretty quick to display useful form following his switch from Ireland late last summer, and rather belatedly opened his account dropped into A2 company four days ago, breaking smartly and always having matters in hand. He's done even better at a higher level already and, back in maiden open company, we're hopeful he can again boss matters on the wide outside.

"Topher Payne's satirical comedy has its finger right on the button," says Mark.

After my posting a week or two back about the incredibly dodgy 5V wall warts that came with some Aliexpress gear, which I tossed after pulling one open, I decided to test the random collection of unused wall warts that I have lying around using a generic fan-cooled dummy load.




 First up, a totally unbranded 5V 2A wall wart. Started at 5.05V at 500mA and stayed dropped to around 5.02V at the full 2A load, with no signs of distress.




 Next up, a HuntKey 5V 1A wall wart, from a large, well-established Chinese manufacturer, started at 5.20V and stayed pretty constant at that voltage up to the full 1A load.




 Finally, a DVE 5V 2A wall wart, a Taiwanese company operating in Shenzhen but possibly cloned given the number of dodgy-looking units on Aliexpress, started at about 5.05V but sagged to 4.90V at full load.




 Interesting that the dodgy no-name brand had great regulation while the DVE one sagged quite a bit. Might toss that one since it doesn't say good things about the overall design.

But this wasn’t about you.
 It’s about LSU.
 And don’t let anybody tell you that you didn’t belong in the Superdome Monday night just because your conference, the ACC, couldn’t put up enough resistance to really get a grip on your worth.
 Just a guess, but you probably really were the second-best team in the country this season.
 There’s something to say for that.
 There’s a good chance you also have the second-best quarterback in the land and he might well be the best when he comes back next year.
 But this year?
 Sorry.
 This was about LSU. This was about a homegrown Cajun head coach, Ed Orgeron, who changed when he saw it was needed, who galvanized a team and a state … who finally broke down in tears as the purple-and-gold confetti swirled around the Superdome.
 “One team, one heartbeat,” he screamed one last time at the Tigers fans, not a one of whom apparently left the dome until the final celebrating was done inside.
 They chanted all the school ditties until the public address announcer finally told them to leave and move the party to French Quarter.
 LSU is back where it belongs. That’s what this was about — winning championships in the Superddome and marching to the French Quarter to let it all out.
 Clemson, a fine team, a great team, just happened to be in the way.
 This was about the best quarterback in the country in Joe Burrow who maybe should get another Heisman Trophy just for what he did in the two playoff games.
 Not all Heisman Trophy winners fare so well in postseason. This one won the stiff-arm trophy by a landslide and then upped his game another notch on the biggest stages.
 Yeah, the Ohio kid fit right in. He wasn’t the only one.
 The tall, lanky Ohio kid took one final, clock-bleeding knee in the shadow of the goal posts, then immediately hugged his 5-foot-8 Louisiana born-and-bred running back, Clyde Edwards-Helaire.
 Coach O says it all the time. One more time — One Team, One Heartbeat.
 If there was any doubt coming in, LSU showed once and for all, and mostly forever, that these Tigers were the best and most exciting and sometimes electrifying team in the country this season, and maybe the most jaw-dropping offense college football has ever seen.
 No offense, Clemson.
 It wasn’t you.
 You even gave LSU some concern there early.
 LSU couldn’t get going in the first quarter — field position seemed to be the culprit — then looked as unstoppable as ever in the second quarter, that familiar bang-bang-bang offense kicking in to score 21 points in final 10 minutes of the half.
 Field position had something to do with it, but Clemson also covered the Tigers’ deep stable of wide receivers for a while, which was a startling new development for this LSU offense to deal with.
 Not that it changed anything.
 Yes, Clemson had the nation’s best defense coming in.
 LSU finished with 628 yards.
 Ordinarily that might embarrass a proud team like the Tiger Paws, but not this time.
 No need, Clemson.
 LSU has been doing this kind of thing all year.
 Nobody around here totally understands either.
 One year you’re in Les Miles rehab, relying on defense and ball control, the next a strange alien offense drops in, maybe from outer space, and you’re putting moon-shot numbers.
 Bottom line?

McMenemy brought Marcus Bent to Indonesia from Birmingham - and learned lessons from the experience
 Instead of a Flying Dutchman, McMenemy turned to a poised Portuguese. The arrival of Paulo Sergio, a midfielder who came up through the ranks of Sporting's fabled academy with Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo, was a masterstroke.
 Sergio had starred under ex-Blackburn boss Steve Kean as Brunei DPMM won Singapore's S.League in 2015 and he quickly became the glue that held McMenemy's young side together.
 A motivated coach bred a motivated group of players and the wins kept coming.
 With three games of the season to go, Bhayangkara were top and locked in a three-way title battle with Bali United and PSM Makassar, clubs with deeper pockets and bigger fanbases.
 "No-one expected us to be challenging for the title but I wouldn't say this was another Leicester City story. We weren't a counter-attacking team - we played attractive football and dominated games. The belief was always there and with a couple of games of the season to go, we were top and fighting hard to stay there.
 "Then we had a huge slice of luck."
 In a 1-1 away draw at McMenemy's former club Mitra Kukar, ex-Liverpool midfielder Momo Sissoko played for the hosts despite being suspended. The Indonesian FA awarded Bhayangkara the three points, leaving them in need of a victory in their next game to claim the league title with a match to spare.
 They won that match 3-1 and celebrated as if they had won the title - but it was short-lived. Rivals Bali United had complained about the Sissoko decision and the league refused to confirm McMenemy's side as champions until they conducted an investigation.
 "We were left on tenterhooks for two to three days," McMenemy explains. "It was horrible. Eventually, though, we got a phone call in the middle of training saying we'd won the league. It was a messy end and took the shine off things a little given how well we'd played all year. But at least we were able to lift the trophy at home on the last day of the season."
 McMenemy became the first British coach to win the Indonesian championship and, more importantly, finally proved that his initial success with the Philippines had been no fluke.
 "It was an incredible relief. I still have a tweet on my phone that I saved from the day I arrived at Bhayangkara. It said: 'Coach, you've been here twice. Why would you come back? #loser.' That served as great motivation. Everything I learned over the past seven years - the failures and successes, all the different cultures and ideas - came together to help shape the title win."

 Following up last season's run to the state quarterfinals has proven to be an unenviable task for Dutchtown this season.
 It certainly hasn't been easy with the loss of Nick Caldwell and Gary Smith, the team's top two leading scorers from 2018-19.
 The Griffins began the year in a 2-4 hole, and they have never been able to recover. Their struggles continued last week as they played in their first action since Dec. 28.
 On Wednesday, Dutchtown was rolled by Assumption, 68-51, at home. And on Friday night, visiting A.J. Ellender won in blowout fashion by a score of 66-49.
 The game was close in the first quarter, but in the second, Ellender began the period with an 8-0 run that pushed their lead to 10 points. From there, they dominated.
 Right from the beginning, the Griffins fell into a 5-0 hole. However, they did respond with an 11-4 run that was highlighted by a 3-pointer by Ryan Bromfield. It gave them an 11-10 lead. That ended up being their only lead of the game.
 Ellender scored four of the next five points to take a 14-12 advantage into the second quarter.
 To begin the period, Preston Bourda hit a 3-pointer that sparked an 8-0 spurt by Ellender that put them ahead, 22-12.
 Tyshaun Hester then drained a trey to push the advantage to 11, and Bourda nailed another one to put Ellender ahead by 14.
 In all, they outscored Dutchtown 20-10 in the quarter as they went into the half with a 34-22 lead.
 In the second half, Ellender's 6-foot-8 forward Dionjahe Thomas began to take over. Two straight buckets by him gave his team their biggest lead of the game at 16.
 It looked like the Griffins had a glimmer of hope toward the end of the period. A layup by Peyton Loving cut the deficit to 12, but Ellender answered back and extended their advantage to 48-34 heading to the fourth.
 There, Thomas scored two more times down low to push the lead to 18.
 Dutchtown had opportunities to make things more interesting. With the lead cut down to 14, Ellender got sloppy with the ball and went a long stretch without scoring.
 However, Dutchtown missed easy layups, and throughout the game, they shot poorly from the free-throw line.
 In the end, Ellender cruised to the 66-49 victory.
 In the win, Ellender had four players score in double figures. Thomas and Nykee Niyori Johnson, Jr. each had 16. Hester followed with 15, and Bourda chipped in with 11.
 As for Dutchtown, they were led by Troy Thomas as he scored 19. The only other double-figure scorer was Bromfield with 11.
 Brian Norris and Cameron Hunter each scored four.
 The loss was Dutchtown's fourth in their last five games as it dropped their overall record to 6-11.
 The Griffins will hit the road on Jan. 14 to face Denham Springs. They faced the Yellow Jackets back on Dec. 6, and won going away, 50-37.
 On Friday, Dutchtown will face district and parish rival East Ascension at home.

HONOLULU -- Cameron Smith was running out of holes, but not hope.
   
 Smith was two shots behind with two holes to play in the steady rain Sunday at the Sony Open, and Brendan Steele had not shown any signs of cracking. Three holes later, Smith only had to two-putt from 10 feet to win a playoff.
   
 "I just hung in there, and what do you know?" Smith said.
   
 The 26-year-old Australian finally had a PGA Tour title he could call his own. He had won twice at the Australian PGA Championship, and he shared the team title with Jonas Blixt at the Zurich Classic in New Orleans in 2017.
   
 For this PGA Tour victory, his help came from the guy he was trying to beat.
   
 Steele had a three-shot lead when he holed a bunker shot for birdie on the 11th hole and he never trailed the entire day until it fell apart at the end. He missed a 6-foot par putt on the 17th, and then hit a wild hook from the fairway on the par-5 18th and never had a reasonable look at birdie.
   
 On the 10th hole for the playoff, Steele was in ideal position in the fairway, 88 yards from the hole, when he hit wedge over the green. He chipped off the rain-soaked grass and mud to 15 feet and missed the par putt. Smith, who had driven into right rough, chased his shot to 10 feet. He never imagined winning would come down to two putts from short range.
   
 "I thought I had to birdie 17 and do something special on 18," Smith said. "Things fell into place."
   
 He helped with a clutch putt. On the 18th, Smith hit a 3-iron just short and into a bunker, blasted out over the puddles forming on the green to 8 feet and knocked it in for a 2-under 68 to force a playoff.
   
 Steele was trying to win for the first time in just over two years. This was hard to take.
   
 "Everything that could go wrong went wrong today," Steele said after a 71.
   
 The victory assures Smith a spot in the Masters. He also is assured a return to Hawaii next year for the Sentry Tournament of Champions.
   
 "That's been one I've wanted to tick off for a long time, to finally say I've won an event by myself," Smith said. "It's quite good."
   
 They finished at 11-under 269, the highest winning score at the Sony Open in 15 years. The wind finally died to normal strength instead of 30 mph gusts. But the rain was steady, and the course was soaked.
   
 Steele felt that might have cost him on the 10th, which had been playing straight into strong wind all week. At the end, it was nothing more than a strong breeze. The pin was back. The green was soft. Anything at the pin likely would spin off the shelf and leave a long putt, and Smith already was 10 feet away.
   
 "I played the hole six times this week and it's been blowing pretty hard every day," he said. "I don't really have a gauge for it to be blowing just 5 mph or whatever it was. I think I just over played it because of the way it's been the last few days."
   
 A final round that was wet, gray and full came to life in the final hour, which is about how long it took to play the last two holes because the maintenance crew kept having to squeegee the 18th green.
   
 Steele brought possibilities into play when he missed the green to the left on the par-3 17th, pitched to 6 feet and missed his par putt, reducing his lead to a single shot.
   
 Ryan Palmer and Webb Simpson were in the group ahead, both one shot behind. From a fairway bunker, Palmer went with fairway metal and sent it soaring so far to the right that it bounced off the metal railing atop a monster video board, beyond the corporate tent and vanished, presumably in a backyard. He had to return to the bunker and made bogey.
   
 Simpson's wedge skipped off the soaked green and settled 15 feet behind the hole. He narrowly missed the birdie putt, shot 67 and finished alone in third.
   
 Steele, who had to wait 15 minutes to tee off, had to wait another 15 minutes to hit his second shot from the fairway. He went just as far offline as Palmer, just the opposite direction. It bounced off the roof of the tents left of the green and stopped near the ropes lining the 10th fairway. Given free relief from the grandstands, he hit wedge from the muck to 30 feet and two- putt for par.
   
 "The lie was good, the water was fine," Steele said. "It was just a 2-iron to win a golf tournament. It's a hard shot."
   
 Smith holed his 8-footer for birdie for the second playoff in two weeks.
   
 With his bogey on the 18th, Palmer had to settle for a 68 and tied for fourth with Graeme McDowell, who had a 64 to match the low score Sunday, and Kevin Kisner, who played in the final group but made only one birdie on the back for a 69.

“I’m excited to see if we can continue to hit our potential. Right now, the biggest problem we have has just been an inconsistency across the board.”
 The Hawks (5-5, 5-4) were consistently strong during the final 40 minutes. Casillas gave his team some separation when he scored his third goal midway through the second half. The onslaught continued from there. Stephen Grocki netted a goal, and Ezequiel Barrientos punctuated the win by dispatching the ball into the upper left corner of the goal.
 The Hawks will try to keep rolling on Thursday at John Paul II.

 As the great Ric Flair always says: To be the man, you have to beat the man.
 On Monday night, LSU can do just that. The 14-0 Tigers have a chance to win their fourth national title and their first since 2007, but to do so, they'll have to knock off defending champion Clemson, a team that has won two of the last three national titles and is currently riding a 29-game winning streak.
 It will be a national championship game that will have Ascension Parish represented well. There are four players from the area that are on LSU's roster.
 Most notably, Dutchtown alum Lloyd Cushenberry is the Tigers' starter at center, and Donaldsonville alum Stephen Sullivan is a receiver/tight end.
 Also on the roster for LSU are a pair of East Ascension alums in Cameron Wire and Keenen Dunn. Wire is a redshirt freshman offensive tackle, and Dunn is a sophomore running back that transferred from Indiana Wesleyan.
 There are many intriguing matchups across the board.
 Offensively, each team features elite quarterbacks with 1,000-yard rushers and deep, talented receiving corps.
 Overall, LSU leads the nation in points per game with 49, while Clemson ranks fourth with 45. The Tigers are also ranked first in total offense with 564 yards per contest, while Clemson ranks third with 541.
 The orange-clad Tiger attack is led by sophomore quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who is undefeated as a starter, and he is believed by many to be the top pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.
 Lawrence has been red-hot during the second half of the season. Through Clemson's first seven games, Lawrence threw 14 touchdown passes, but he was picked off eight times. In the seven games since, he has thrown 22 touchdowns and zero interceptions.
 Lawrence has also become a threat on the ground. He's averaging 37 yards rushing per game and has scored eight touchdowns. In Clemson's semifinal victory over Ohio State, Lawrence rushed for a career-high 107 yards.
 But the Tigers' main threat on the ground is Louisiana native Travis Etienne, who has rushed for 1,536 yards and 18 touchdowns this season. He is averaging a ridiculous eight yards per carry.
 Although LSU's defense has struggled against the pass in 2019, they rank 20th against the run, yielding just 118 rushing yards per game.
 LSU has four receivers that have at least 500 yards this season--including the dynamic duo of Ja'Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson, who each have more than 1,400 yards and 18 touchdowns.
 Clemson has the lethal combo of Tee Higgins and Justyn Ross. Higgins has 1,115 yards and 13 touchdowns. He averaged a whopping 20 yards per catch.
 Ross has 789 yards and eight scores.
 Statistically, Clemson will have the best defense LSU has faced all year. The Tigers rank first in scoring defense, giving up just 12 points per game. They're second in total defense as they yield just 264 yards per contest.
 Also, they're No. 1 against the pass, and they rank 16th agains the run.
 The run game will get a big boost for LSU. Head coach Ed Orgeron said that Clyde Edwards-Helaire will be 100 percent for the game. Edwards-Helaire was limited in the Peach Bowl, after suffering a hamstring injury at practice leading up to the game.
 Not only did Edwards-Helaire rush for more than 1,300 yards this season, but he caught 50 passes for 399 yards and a score. He is also the Tigers' best running back when it comes to pass protection.
 Another player that will return for LSU is outside linebacker Michael Divinity. Divinity missed the last six games as he served a suspension. But though he was ineligible to play, Divinity never stopped practicing with the team.
 Divinity led the team in sacks last season, and before his suspension, he led the team in sacks in 2019 as well.
 The last time Clemson and LSU played, it was in the 2012 Chick-fil-A Bowl. Clemson won on a last-second field goal, 25-24.

 La Feria - Beth Oneida Coffin, of La Feria, Texas, passed away on Thursday, January 9, 2020 in her home with her loving Daughter-In-Law Irene Davila Coffin by her side. Beth was born on December 13, 1925 to Wilburn J. Brown and Nina Mae Kyle in Ocoee, Tennessee. Beth moved to Harlingen, Texas after high school and began working for Southwestern Bell Telephone. After training, she became an operator for the Harlingen Division which covered part of the lower Rio Grande Valley. On October 6, 1950 she married Robert Ross Coffin from Edinburg, Texas at The First Methodist Church in Harlingen. Beth was preceded in death by her parents, her son, James Stephen Coffin, sisters, Evelyn (Ken) Martin, Margaret Sizer, and brother, Wendell E. Brown. She is survived by her step-children, Robert Ross Coffin, Jr., Candace Coffin Moloney (Jim) and her dedicated care-giver, friend, and daughter-in-law Irene Davila Coffin along with nephews, nieces, step-grandchildren and step-great -grandchildren. Beth lived in Edcouch during the 1950's and 60's where her husband, Bob, owned Edcouch-Elsa Auto Supply. Beth returned to work for Southwestern Bell in Mercedes after several years leave, and retired with over 30 years of service. Beth enjoyed retirement...traveling to see friends and family in both the US and Mexico. Beth loved going to Arturo's restaurant in Progresso, her favorite place to eat, working in her yard, reading and discussing South Texas History as well as reading every Paper Back Western she could get her hands on. Beth was a good golfer in her earlier years. After a few years of retirement, she went to work for General Telephone as a part-time employee. Then after a couple years of work, Beth decided retirement life was the way to go! Working in her yard, spending time with family, friends and watching sports. We are blessed she was able to enjoy a full life until a few years ago when her health started to decline.

Her response stopped me cold, but I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised.
 With the dogs of war straining at the leash, the missiles flying in Iran, and our bellicose and unstable commander-in-chief lurching from one scarcely believable justification to the next, the prospect of another American forever war on the other side of the globe didn’t seem all that far-fetched.
 First up, I disabused her of the notion that any of her classmates might be drafted, reassuring her that there was no such movement afoot on Capitol Hill. Nor would there likely ever be one. The American military remains an all- volunteer force comprised not of the nation’s elite, but of the sons and daughters of Main Street America. Trump’s voters. Some of my daughter’s classmates – if they ever heed the call to serve – may well be among them.
 She seemed relieved at that news. Talking to her about the threat of climate change was another matter entirely.
 it seemed to me there were decades remaining before the Earth might ever be rendered uninhabitable because of climate change, I offered. Which didn’t mean that we shouldn’t do all we can right now, I added.
 “But Australia is burning,” she countered, her brown eyes wide with alarm, anger creeping into the edges of her voice.
 She had me there. I’d seen the photos of scorched koalas and dead kangaroos. The endless walls of flame. It’s difficult to find the words to describe the scale, and the scope, of the ecological and human catastrophe that’s unfolding on the other side of the world.
 As of this writing, NPR was reporting that a hellish “megafire” comprising an unfathomable 1.5 million acres, an area three times larger than any known brush fire in California, had taken shape in New South Wales and Victoria, the country’s most populous states.

El exsecretario general del PP de Valencia Ricardo Costa ha pedido quedar eximido en el juicio de la rama valenciana de la trama Gürtel porque el beneficiario de la supuesta financiación irregular de las campañas electorales de 2007 y 2008 sería el partido y no él. Así lo ha planteado su abogado en las cuestiones previas del juicio a la antigua cúpula del PP valenciano por la supuesta financiación irregular de actos de dichas campañas pagados a Gürtel con dinero B de empresarios.El letrado de Costa ha argumentado que, en todo caso, el beneficiario de esa supuesta financiación habría sido el PP, que ni siquiera está acusado a título lucrativo (como en el juicio a la primera etapa de Gürtel), con lo que -a su parecer- no hay delito. Por su parte, la fiscal Míriam Segura ha anunciado que rebajará su petición de 24 años y medio de prisión para el presunto líder de la trama, Francisco Correa, si continúa colaborando con la justicia. Diecinueve acusados se sientan en el banquillo de los acusados de la Audiencia Nacional, entre ellos cinco excargos del PP, encabezados por Ricardo Costa y el exvicepresidente del Gobierno valenciano Vicente Rambla.La representante del Ministerio Público pide para Costa siete años y nueve meses de prisión y seis años y medio para Rambla. El resto de políticos acusados son el exvicesecretario y la exgerente del PP valenciano David Serra y Cristina Ibáñez, que se enfrentan cada uno a una petición de siete años y nueve meses de prisión, y la exdiputada en las Cortes valencianas Yolanda García, para la que la fiscal solicita seis meses de cárcel. Además están acusados nueve empresarios y cinco integrantes de la trama Gürtel, entre ellos los principales cabecillas, Francisco Correa; su presunto número dos, el ex secretario de Organización del PP gallego Pablo Crespo, y el considerado el hombre de la trama en Valencia, Álvaro Pérez 'El Bigotes', los tres en prisión tras ser condenados en la pieza del entramado del caso Fitur. Juan Casanueva, abogado de Ricardo Costa, ha pedido el sobreseimiento de la causa respecto a su representado al estimar que son nulos los escritos de la Fiscalía y del PSOE de Valencia -que ejerce de acusación- por no concretar los hechos que le atribuyen. Ha abundado en que el beneficiario del supuesto delito electoral sería el PP, que no está llamado a este juicio ni como partícipe a título lucrativo, y sin embargo se le juzga a Costa que, ha apuntado, es un "actor secundario" respecto a los hechos enjuiciados. En cualquier caso ha estimado, al igual que los abogados del resto de políticos, que los delitos electorales y de falsedad ya han prescrito por el tiempo transcurrido. Sin embargo, la fiscal se ha opuesto a todas las cuestiones previas de las defensas entre ellas la alegación de falta de concreción de las acusaciones. En cuanto a la posible reducción de petición de pena para Correa, la fiscal ha precisado que será en el momento de sus conclusiones definitivas cuando lo contemple bajo la condición de que se haya demostrado en la vista colaboración con la justicia e intención de reparar el daño causado. En esta línea de colaboración, Correa -en prisión por el caso Fitur- remitió hace unos días un escrito al Juzgado Central de lo Penal en el que confesó que el PP de Valencia pagó en B a la trama Gürtel, en concreto a la empresa Orange Market, trabajos en campañas electorales o mediante facturas ficticias a empresarios por trabajos no realizados. También ha mostrado la fiscal la intención de rebajar su petición de pena para nueve empresarios -para los que pide entre 4 y 6 años de cárcel- que, el pasado mes de febrero y a cambio de eludir la prisión, reconocieron haber financiado al PP valenciano en campañas electorales. Al respecto, las defensas de los empresarios han pedido que la fiscal no solo rebaje la petición de pena a menos de dos años para que no ingresen en prisión sino que la sustituya por multas, que ya han tenido que pagar para cumplir el citado acuerdo con la Fiscalía. La fiscal ha aclarado que en todo caso accederá a ello en el momento procesal oportuno tras la práctica de la prueba en el juicio. La Abogacía del Estado y la acusación ejercida por el PSOE de Valencia se han adherido a lo manifestado por la fiscal. La abogada del PSOE ha retirado la acusación contra uno de los diez empresarios encausados, José Enrique Fresquet, con lo que ha quedado eximido del juicio ya que no está acusado por la Fiscalía. El juez Central de lo Penal de la Audiencia Nacional, José María Vázquez Honrubia, encargado de la vista, ha rechazado todas las cuestiones previas planteadas por las defensas por lo que el juicio seguirá mañana con las declaraciones de los primeros acusados.

Timeform provide three selections from Sheffield on Tuesday... WILLY THE RAM (Trap 1) - 18.55 Sheffield WILLY THE RAM was hit hard by the grader on the back of a facile debut success at Swindon back in November, yet, to his credit, he displayed he was a further improved model when landing his last competitive start at the same venue last month. His trials around Owlerton have been solid as opposed to spectacular but he promises to improve further and, debuting in A6 grade we're confident he can take another step forward and emerge victorious. INCA CONEY (Trap 4) - 19.09 Sheffield INCA CONEY is clearly a very forward youngster, highlighted by her very slick exits from the boxes over four bends in recent weeks. In truth, the 500-metre trip was looking at the limit of her stamina. However, she's been impressive for the switch to sprinting, again displaying a fine burst of early speed to land a maiden contest seven days ago. Being a June whelp she can be expected to come forward again as she gains further experience and we're hopeful she can come home in front again taking on her fellow youngsters. THE OTHER REX (Trap 6) - 19.26 Sheffield THE OTHER REX was pretty quick to display useful form following his switch from Ireland late last summer, and rather belatedly opened his account dropped into A2 company four days ago, breaking smartly and always having matters in hand. He's done even better at a higher level already and, back in maiden open company, we're hopeful he can again boss matters on the wide outside.

La carrière internationale de Spike Lee a pris son essor sur la Croisette, puisqu’il a 29 ans quand il vient présenter en 1986, à la Quinzaine des réalisateurs, son premier long métrage, la comédie _Nola Darling n’en fait qu’à sa tête_ ( _She’s Gotta Have it_ en VO) qu’il a tournée en douze jours à Brooklyn avec un budget dérisoire. En 1989, Lee redébarque en force et en compétition officielle cette fois avec _Do the Right Thing,_ tableau du quartier de Bedford-Stuyvesant à Brooklyn en pleine canicule estivale où les tensions entre les différents protagonistes s’exacerbent dans un climat de racisme et d’exaspération communautaire. Le cinéaste tient le rôle de Mookie, livreur de pizza, qui se faufile dans les rues et dans les méandres des relations de voisinage, dévoilant la violence policière et les enjeux fratricides d’un microcosme urbain livré à lui-même. La bande-son, avec en particulier le rap _Fight the Power_ de Public Enemy, contribue encore à propulser le film en manifeste d’un cinéma indépendant américain en plein essor et, pour la première fois à cette échelle, un manifeste de cinéma noir que le visionnaire président du jury Wim Wenders n’aura pas la bonne idée d’inscrire au palmarès, lui préférant un autre petit jeune, Blanc celui-là : Steven Soderbergh qui, avec _Sexe, Mensonges et Vidéo,_ son premier film, remporte la palme d’or (et le prix d’interprétation masculine pour son acteur, James Spader).

Indian markets ended at a record close for the second straight session, following gains in Asian peers, led by gains in index heavyweights like HDFC, ITC, Axis Bank, and TCS. Major buying was seen in FMCG, metal, and IT sectors, while banks were in the red for the day.However, gains were capped as hopes of a rate cut in February dimmed after data showed a higher-than-expected surge in inflation. December CPI inflation rose to 7.35 percent, its highest level in more than five years. The inflation in December surpassed the RBI's ceiling of 6 percent. Experts believe the central bank will hold rates in February, and closely watch fiscal deficit, before resuming the rate cuts.The Sensex settled 93 points higher at a record close of 41,952, while Nifty also ended at a new closing high of 12,362, up 33 points.In intra-day deals, the Sensex rose as much as 134 points to a new high of 41,994, while Nifty also hit a record high for the third straight session. It jumped 45 points to its record high of 12,374.Broader markets also gained during the day with Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap indices up 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.Among stocks, Vedanta, Britannia, Hero MotoCorp, ITC, and Cipla were the top gainers on Nifty, while Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank, UPL, Reliance Industries, and SBI led the losses.Shares of Yes Bank fell 8 percent as brokerages remained bearish on the stock amid prolonged uncertainty over the private lender's plans to raise capital. Kotak Institutional Equities maintained a 'sell' call on the stock and cut its target to Rs 40 from Rs 55 a share. Morgan Stanley has retained an underweight call on the stock with a target at Rs 25 a share.Sectoral indices were mixed for the day.

NASHVILLE (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee's administration has invoked executive privilege multiple times to withhold documents from public records requests, even though such privilege is not defined in the state's law, nor mentioned in its constitution.
 Officials in Lee's office say they are using it interchangeably with a separate protection when documents are deemed part of the executive office's decision-making process.
 Supreme courts in a handful of states have upheld a governor's right to claim executive privilege in some circumstances.
 According to documents provided by Lee's team, "executive privilege" was cited three times during 2019 — the Republican's first year in office — when denying certain documents from being released to the public.
 Tennessee statutes, including the state's open records laws, do not define executive privilege. The Tennessee Constitution does not mention it.
 However, Lee's communication director Chris Walker says executive privilege is not a new exemption. Instead, he says it is being treated as the same established exemption known as the "deliberative process" privilege.
 That exemption allows high government officials a "deliberative process" privilege which ensures certain documents remain secret if officials determine them part of their decision-making process.
 In each instance where the governor's office cited executive privilege to deny public records, it also cited deliberative process. The governor's office did not explain why both exemptions were used if they are supposed to be interchangeable.
 Documents shielded by attorney-client privilege are also protected from being released in Tennessee.
 Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, says open government advocates worry that deliberative process exemptions will be used too broadly — thus making it difficult to know whether it's being used improperly without involving the courts.
 "I think it would be helpful if the governor's office explained in more detail what they consider as covered by deliberative process," she said in an email.
 In total, Lee's administration in 2019 declined to fulfill 13 public records requests after determining they fell under executive privilege, deliberative process or attorney-client privilege. The overwhelming majority of those requests came from news reporters from Tennessee.
 Most recently, Lee's office cited executive privilege, deliberative process and attorney-client privilege after The Associated Press submitted a public records request in December seeking all emails and other pertinent documents surrounding the governor's recent decision to keep accepting refugees in Tennessee.
 "When there's a reason for privacy — and certainly there are when there is a deliberation on policy or there's a reason it would not be beneficial to the people of Tennessee to provide information — then certainly that privilege should be used and that deliberative process should be protected," Lee said Friday.
 Presidents have used executive privilege to keep information from the courts, Congress and the public to protect the confidentiality of the Oval Office decision-making process. As in Tennessee, there is no reference to presidential executive privilege in the U.S. Constitution, but the Supreme Court has held that it derives from the president's ability to carry out the duties the commander in chief holds under the Constitution.
 To date, supreme courts in a handful of states have said a governor is allowed to claim executive privilege as a reason to withhold documents from the public.
 In 2013, Washington's state Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that the governor there is allowed to claim "executive privilege" even though that exemption isn't among the hundreds listed in state law.
 However, the court also added that the privilege only applied to communications made to inform policy choices. Gov. Jay Inslee, who took office the same year as the ruling, has not exercised the privilege so far.
 The following year, the Oklahoma Supreme Court agreed that the state's governor had a unique privilege not subject to the state's Open Records Act.
 As in Washington, Oklahoma justices said the privilege could only apply to policy deliberations or making a discretionary decision. However, the privilege could also be subject to review by a judge.
 Tennessee's statutes include more than 500 exemptions to public records, and more exist through case law.
 Lee, a first-time politician, vowed to make government more transparent when he took over the top elected office last year.
 However, the governor has not yet followed through on a promise to overhaul Tennessee's public records and open meeting laws that he initially promised during his transition.
 And he has no immediate plans to start doing so.
 "We are always looking for more opportunities to be more transparent with processes but I don't have any plans in my legislative package," Lee said when asked about 2020 and the upcoming legislative session.

Instead LSU answered back, led by Burrow, as it has anytime an opponent managed to stand toe-to-toe with the champs.
 LSU scored the game’s final 14 points to put away a Clemson team that had won 29 games in a row. Burrow threw touchdowns to Moss in the third quarter and Terrace Marshall in the fourth to put the championship on ice.
 All the while LSU’s oft-criticized defense pitched a shutout over the final 25 minutes of game time. Dave Aranda’s group held Clemson to a paltry 1-for-11 on third down and prevented Trevor Lawrence from throwing a touchdown.
 A Lawrence fumble — forced by All-American safety Grant Delpit and recovered by freshman cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. — set off a wild celebration in the Superdome. That was the moment when guarded optimism gave way to jubilation within even the most skeptical LSU fan.
 “This was all about LSU,” Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. “They were the better team. The best team won tonight. That’s the bottom line. All you can do is tip your hat.”
 LSU has its fourth national championship in program history, the third since 2003. All three of those were coronated right here in New Orleans.
 That made it all the more special for the coach who grew up in Louisiana and the quarterback who came south looking for a new place to call home.
 “We love the state of Louisiana,” Orgeron said, tears in his eyes, as he hoisted the trophy. “This one is for everybody. One team. One heartbeat.”
 “To do this in New Orleans is even more special,” Burrow added. “This is going to be remembered for a long time.”

Delhi's Matia Mahal Assembly Constituency has witnessed a lot of improvements during Arvind Kejriwal's five-year term, but the government's inability to complete the development works may not go down well with the people this time.Home to historic Ajmeri Gate, Chandni Mahal, Chatta Lal Mian, Chawri Bazar, Chitli Qabar, Churiwalan, Delhi Gate, Hauz Qazi, Jama Masjid, Lal Kuan, Sita Ram Bazar, Suiwalan and Turkman Gate, the Constituency was bagged by AAP's Asim Ahmed Khan with 59.23 per cent votes in 2015 assembly elections.The densely populated area has 1,25,220 voters with 59,461 females. The Muslim- dominated area has a sex ratio of 905 -- far above the state's gender ratio of 824.The Constituency, marked with narrow lanes, has never elected the Congress, even when the party was in power for 15 years in the city.Shoaib Iqbal, who just joined AAP ahead of elections, had been a five-time MLA from the area contesting from different political parties. He was elected first in 1993 from Janata Dal and was re-elected from the same party in 1998. In 2003, he was part of the Janata Dal (Secular) when he was elected for the third time. The next time in 2008, he contested from the Lok Janshakti Party and in 2013, Iqbal was again elected for the fifth time from Janata Dal (United).His winning streak was broken by Asim Ahmed Khan when AAP swept to power in the 2015 assembly elections with a humongous majority, winning 67 of the 70 seats. This time Iqbal was a Congress candidate. Now Iqbal joining the AAP, speculations are rife that he might get the ticket for the February 8 polls from this constituency.With over half of the population being Muslims, the religious card is an important factor in the polls, but broken narrow lanes, lack of piped water and sewer connection have been the main issues of the area.Congested roads and web of wires also dot the narrow bylanes, the main concern of the people; the incomplete work might harm the AAP's prospects this time.&quot;The work started on a good note. but now the roads are broken and the work of water and sewer connection has been left incomplete in most of the areas. This is causing more problems,&quot; said 48-year old Aarif Kamal.Echoing him is 55-year-old Aamina, who said getting piped water is still a dream for the residents here.&quot;The pipe came to my area, but only a handful of people are getting piped water. For the pipeline, they even damaged the roads,&quot; she said.Apart from the work, the candidate's image can also be a driving force in the election.Also, it is worth mentioning that Khan and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal had not been on a good term during the last five years.Asim Ahmed Khan was sworn in as a cabinet minister under Kejriwal in 2015. He was made the minister of Food and Civil Supplies, Environment and Forest and Minority Affairs. However, after a few months, Kejriwal sacked Khan on charges of corruption. Later, Khan alleged that he and his family are facing &quot;death threats&quot; from Kejriwal.The seat has been crucial for all the political parties. While the AAP and the BJP are likely to leave no stone unturned to capture the seat, the Congress is also said to be in the race to win it for the first time.Delhi will go to polls on February 8 and votes will be counted on February 11.

Even before resort fees became the subject of legal scrutiny, it was crystal clear that hotels have to do a better job of communicating their value. Instead of simply adding a resort fee to the total at the end of a guest's reservation, I recommend going to great lengths to explain what exactly it includes and how it benefits a guest's stay (i.e., pool and spa access, special amenities, children's programs, etc.). Within your booking process, don't just break out the resort fee to outline its purpose, but use it as an opportunity to include real value-adds that incentivize booking direct (e.g., a complimentary yoga class or welcome drink).

The proposals also include cutting the opening hours of its remaining 38 libraries by an average of 15%.
 In an open letter, the Hampshire Authors for Libraries group said: "If local culture is to flourish and local communities are to thrive then libraries are vital.
 "To close a library is to say we do not value culture, we do not value community, we do not want to give children a chance. We will put pressure on Hampshire County Council until they think again."
 Among more than 40 writers who put their names to the letter were One Day writer David Nicholls, children's author Ali Sparkes and Neil Gaiman, whose novel Good Omens has been adapted for television and is currently being screened on BBC Two.
 Recreation councillor Sean Woodward previously blamed the cuts on a lack of central government funding and changes in people's habits.
 "We've seen in the last 10 years something like two million fewer books being issued per year so it's a huge change. But we want to make sure that the libraries which are open are thriving, well run, well attended and well used by our residents," he said.
 About 400 people currently work for Hampshire's library service.

But maybe it’s not about raw size. Maybe Big Dairy is a myth invented by those who want to make family dairy farmers seem “big” to advance some contrasting image of their competitors – who want to be seen as plucky, usually plant- based, upstarts taking on Big Dairy with highly touted “innovation.”
 Let’s explore this. Take, for example, Perfect Day, allegedly just a humble innovator with nothing to offer but a thousand $20-a-pint tubs of imitation ice cream … and startup funding from Temasek – a venture-capital arm of the government of Singapore -- and Archer-Daniels-Midland, an agri-business behemoth with $64 billion in annual sales that ranks #49 on the Fortune 500. Other plant- and cell-based alternatives are financed by Jeff Bezos (worth roughly $115 billion, the world’s richest man at the end of 2019) and Bill Gates (net worth over $100 billion) – not exactly little guys, to say the least. In fact, if you added up the gross receipts of all 40,000 dairy farmers in the United States last year (an estimated $39.9 billion), you’d only be worth about two-fifths as much as Jeff Bezos. So-called “Big Dairy” will never compete with that.
 To be sure: Dairy is a significant U.S. industry. According to research commissioned by the “Got Jobs?” campaign commissioned by dairy groups, including NMPF, the sector as a whole is responsible for nearly 3 million U.S. jobs and has an overall economic impact of more than $620 billion, including indirect effects. Dairy directly employs nearly 1 million Americans, with an impact of more than $206 billion. In agriculture and in the U.S. economy, we aren’t David to someone else’s Goliath. Whatever success we have is because we work hard and work together.

 Sissoko featured for 14 clubs including European sides Liverpool, Valencia, PSG, Juventus, Fiorentina and Livante and won seven trophies.
 During his time with Valencia he won a La liga title, the European Super Cup as well as the now-defunct Uefa Cup.
 That success led to a move to English Premier League side Liverpool in 2005 where he won another European Super Cup and the FA Cup.
 After falling out of favour with then Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez he moved to Italian giants Juventus.
 The France-born players first professional French club was was Paris Saint- Germain, where he won the Ligue 1 title.
 Sissoko also won the French Ligue 1 with PSG and the English FA cup, Uefa super cup and FA community shield with Liverpool.
 Following his release by PSG in 2013 his club career became somewhat nomadic with a spell back in Spain at Levante, before moving to Asia where he played for Chinese outfit Shanghai Shenhua and Indian club Pune City.
 He then returned to Europe and the Italian second-tier as he signed for Ternana, where he spent just three weeks before going back to Asia and Indonesian side Mitra Kukar.
 His journey then took him to central America and a stint at Mexican club Atletico San Luis in 2017.
 Sissoko's final two clubs were Kitchee in Hong Kong and then finally a short time at French side Sochaux, who he signed a six-month deal with in January last year.
 He was born in France but committed his international future to his country of origin Mali and made his debut for the Eagles in 2004.
 Sissoko made 34 appearances for Mali scoring two goals, and he helped the Eagles to a third place finish at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations.
 In all he played at four Africa Cup of Nations finals - 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2013.

This time Iqbal was a Congress candidate. Now Iqbal joining the AAP, speculations are rife that he might get the ticket for the February 8 polls from this constituency.
 With over half of the population being Muslims, the religious card is an important factor in the polls, but broken narrow lanes, lack of piped water and sewer connection have been the main issues of the area.
 Congested roads and web of wires also dot the narrow bylanes, the main concern of the people; the incomplete work might harm the AAP's prospects this time.
 "The work started on a good note. but now the roads are broken and the work of water and sewer connection has been left incomplete in most of the areas. This is causing more problems," said 48-year old Aarif Kamal.
 Echoing him is 55-year-old Aamina, who said getting piped water is still a dream for the residents here.
 "The pipe came to my area, but only a handful of people are getting piped water. For the pipeline, they even damaged the roads," she said.
 Apart from the work, the candidate's image can also be a driving force in the election.
 Also, it is worth mentioning that Khan and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal had not been on a good term during the last five years.
 Asim Ahmed Khan was sworn in as a cabinet minister under Kejriwal in 2015. He was made the minister of Food and Civil Supplies, Environment and Forest and Minority Affairs. However, after a few months, Kejriwal sacked Khan on charges of corruption. Later, Khan alleged that he and his family are facing "death threats" from Kejriwal.
 The seat has been crucial for all the political parties. While the AAP and the BJP are likely to leave no stone unturned to capture the seat, the Congress is also said to be in the race to win it for the first time.
 Delhi will go to polls on February 8 and votes will be counted on February 11.

NEW ORLEANS -- Joe Burrow capped his record-shattering season by passing for five touchdowns and running for one to lead No. 1 LSU to a 42-25 victory over No. 3 Clemson in the College Football Playoff championship game on Monday night.
 Burrow, who won the Heisman Trophy by a record margin, completed 31 of 49 passes for 463 yards and rushed 14 times for 58 yards. He finished the season with NCAA records of 60 touchdown passes and 65 touchdowns accounted for, breaking the marks of 58 and 63, respectively, set by Hawaii's Colt Brennan in 2006.
 "He's one of the greatest players in LSU history," LSU coach Ed Orgeron said of Burrow, who was selected the game's Offensive MVP. "He has done so much for the state of Louisiana and LSU. We are so grateful to Joe Burrow."
 LSU completed the first 15-0 season in school history in its first trip to the CFP, which is in its sixth year. The Bayou Bengals won their fourth national championship and first since 2007.
 "This is what I have wanted to do since the time I was 5 years old, is to hoist this trophy," Burrow said. "We weren't going to let someone come in here and steal this from us in our home state."
 Defending national champion Clemson, which had won two of the last three national titles, finished 14-1 after seeing its 29-game winning streak end.
 "It sucks, but we have to look back at what we did," Clemson sophomore quarterback Trevor Lawrence said. "We did a lot of great things, and we've got a lot more in store. We have to enjoy all the things we accomplished. It was amazing to be a part of what we did."
 Biletnikoff Award winner Ja'Marr Chase caught nine of Burrow's passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns.
 Burrow outdueled Lawrence, the Offensive MVP of last season's title-game victory over Alabama. Lawrence, who lost for the first time in 26 games as a college starter, completed 18 of 37 passes for 234 yards and didn't throw for a touchdown, though he did run 1 yard for the game's first score.
 LSU hounded Lawrence into multiple high throws and made key plays by holding Clemson to one third-down conversion in 11 tries.
 "We just locked in," said LSU linebacker Patrick Queen, the game's Defensive MVP who had 2-1/2 tackles for loss among his eight stops. "We have been dialed in all season. We just wanted to come out and prove to everybody that we're nothing to play with."
 LSU led 28-17 at halftime, but Travis Etienne's 3-yard touchdown run and a two-point conversion pass from Lawrence to Amari Rodgers on Clemson's first possession of the third quarter cut the deficit to three points.
 Burrow threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Thaddeus Moss to give LSU a 35-25 lead after three quarters, and he tossed a 24-yarder to Terrace Marshall Jr. with 12:08 left for the game's final margin. LSU outgained Clemson 628 yards to 394.
 "I thought LSU played a beautiful game," Clemson coach Dabo Swinney. "I thought their quarterback was tremendous. Their receivers, they made some incredible plays that were really well-covered, several of them. But they just made the play. That's what you have to do to win these type of games.
 "Give them credit. They played a heck of a game and deserved to win the game. They were definitely the better team tonight."
 After Lawrence's touchdown run midway through the first quarter, Burrow threw a 52-yard touchdown pass to Chase to tie the score at the end of the first quarter.
 Clemson's B.T. Potter made a 52-yard field goal, the longest in CFP finals history, and Tee Higgins ran 36 yards on a reverse for a touchdown that increased Clemson's lead to 17-7, marking LSU's biggest deficit of the season.
 Burrow ran 3 yards for a touchdown and threw touchdown passes of 14 yards to Chase and 6 yards to Moss to give LSU an 11-point halftime lead.
 "We got down, I think it was 17-7, we knew what we had," Burrow said. "We had some tough breaks, getting backed up inside the 5 a couple of times. They had a really good plan early. Once we figured out what they were trying to do, our coaches put together a great game plan at halftime, and we started to roll."
 LSU wrapped up a season in which it defeated seven top-10 teams. The Tigers scored 142 points in their final three games -- against No. 4 Georgia in the Southeastern Conference title game, No. 4 Oklahoma in the Peach Bowl and then Clemson.
 "Years of hard work, culminating in one moment with the best group of guys anybody could ask for," Burrow said. "We worked so hard for this."

While the word itself can carry a negative connotation, conflict is not an inherently bad thing; in fact, it can be both positive and necessary. Healthy disagreements can push teams to dig deeper, challenge their assumptions, and do more analysis and investigation before presenting new ideas. On a broader level, the idea of creative tension is vital to creating a culture of innovation. Organizations should strive to create a marketplace of ideas in which the best one wins. That said, it’s important to keep the following in mind to prevent conflict from becoming a distraction:

It all made sense to me after the third mile, but we still ran three more.
 I figured the best way to learn about the newly-formed Ozark Running Club was to run a mile or six in their shoes, so that’s what I found myself doing on a cold Saturday morning. I followed along as Josh Kitchin and Marc Reitzner led us all over creation. I’m a regular runner myself, but I am definitely not used to the distances they like to travel. That’s okay, the group still offers options for anyone who is interested, and you don’t have to run six miles if you don’t want to.
 I could have stopped, but I decided to push myself. Growth is not always comfortable, nor is the process of making new friends and being part of something bigger than yourself, whether that’s a small club or a big community.
 “For some people, running is a lifelong sport. They have a hard time doing it themselves, but if they knew another group of people who were doing it, it just makes all of the miles more fun and easy,” Kitchin said.
 So we ran, and we talked about our lives, jobs, families and civic involvement. We also talked a great deal about having fun.
 It amazes me sometimes to ask an adult what their hobbies are, and have blank stares come back in return.
 “You know, what about hobbies? What do you do when you aren’t working?” I’ll ask.
 People can’t come up with answers. If they are parents, it’s usually because all of their spare time is dedicated to watching their kids take part in activities, and shuttling the kids to and from their activities. Whether that’s sports, musical pursuits, dance, scouting, church groups, speech and debate, martial arts or something else, parents are bound to their kids activities.
 I want to be clear, I am not speaking out against parental involvement. I think it’s essential for kids who pursue any kind of extracurricular activity to have sources of inspiration beyond their coaches, advisors, teammates and fellow participants. I’m grateful that my own parents showed up as frequently as they did to watch me take part in whatever I was doing throughout my youth, even if that involved making a long drive to watch me sit on the bench in frustration.
 What I’m advocating for, instead, is right-sized involvement mixed with big doses of self-care and community building.
 It doesn’t have to be running, and it doesn’t have to be a tightly-organized activity. It starts with finding an interest, pursuing it and getting to really know some other people with the same interest. it’s so simple, but it’s almost like we’ve forgotten how to embrace this concept.

Spike Lee will serve as jury president during the 2020 Cannes Film Festival.
 The BlacKkKlansman director and his team of jurors, which are yet to be announced, will watch all the films selected for the official competition and decide which should receive the Palme d'Or for Best Film.
 "In this life I have lived, my biggest blessings have been when they arrived unexpected, when they happened out of nowhere. When I got the call that I was offered the opportunity to be president of Cannes jury for 2020, I was shocked, happy, surprised and proud all at the same time," Lee said in a statement. "To me, the Cannes Film Festival (besides being the most important film festival in the world - no disrespect to anybody) has had a great impact on my film career. You could easily say Cannes changed the trajectory of who I became in world cinema.
 "In closing, I'm honoured to be the first person of the African diaspora (USA) to be named president of the Cannes jury and of a main film festival. The Lee family sincerely thanks the Festival de Cannes, Pierre Lescure and Thierry Fremaux and the great people of France who have supported my film career throughout four decades. I will always treasure this special relationship."
 The director has had a strong relationship with Cannes since his debut feature, She's Gotta Have It, premiered in 1986, and his follow-up, Do the Right Thing, was selected for the official competition in 1989. He has had seven films debut at the French festival, with his most recent effort, BlacKkKlansman, winning the Grand Prix in 2018.
 Lee follows in the footsteps of Mexican director Alejandro G. Inarritu, who headed the jury in 2019 and selected Bong Joon Ho's Parasite for the Palme d'Or. The thriller became the first South Korean film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars on Monday.
 The 73rd Cannes Film Festival is set to run 12 to 23 May.

Indian markets ended at a record close for the second straight session, following gains in Asian peers, led by gains in index heavyweights like HDFC, ITC, Axis Bank, and TCS. Major buying was seen in FMCG, metal, and IT sectors, while banks were in the red for the day.
 However, gains were capped as hopes of a rate cut in February dimmed after data showed a higher-than-expected surge in inflation. December CPI inflation rose to 7.35 percent, its highest level in more than five years. The inflation in December surpassed the RBI's ceiling of 6 percent. Experts believe the central bank will hold rates in February, and closely watch fiscal deficit, before resuming the rate cuts.
 The Sensex settled 93 points higher at a record close of 41,952, while Nifty also ended at a new closing high of 12,362, up 33 points.
 In intra-day deals, the Sensex rose as much as 134 points to a new high of 41,994, while Nifty also hit a record high for the third straight session. It jumped 45 points to its record high of 12,374.
 Broader markets also gained during the day with Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap indices up 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.
 Among stocks, Vedanta, Britannia, Hero MotoCorp, ITC, and Cipla were the top gainers on Nifty, while Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank, UPL, Reliance Industries, and SBI led the losses.
 Shares of Yes Bank fell 8 percent as brokerages remained bearish on the stock amid prolonged uncertainty over the private lender's plans to raise capital. Kotak Institutional Equities maintained a 'sell' call on the stock and cut its target to Rs 40 from Rs 55 a share. Morgan Stanley has retained an underweight call on the stock with a target at Rs 25 a share.
 Sectoral indices were mixed for the day. Nifty Media rose the most, up 2 percent, while Nifty FMCG rose 1.4 percent. Nifty IT and Nifty Metal rose 0.8 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively for the day. Nifty Auto also advanced 0.6 percent and Nifty Pharma added 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, Nifty Bank declined 0.3 percent and Nifty Realty fell 0.1 percent.
 Globally, Asian shares rose amid signs of goodwill between China and the United States, as the world's two biggest economies prepared to sign a truce in their bitter trade war. The US Treasury Department on Monday said China should no longer be designated a currency manipulator - a label it applied as the yuan dropped in August.
 Japan's Nikkei added 0.7 percent to hit its highest in a month. Australian shares rose by the same margin to close at a record. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Shanghai blue chips also hit multi-month peaks.

It was a day of consolidation in Fort Oglethorpe on Monday, Jan. 13, as outdoor retailer Cabela’s closed its Fort Oglethorpe location with plans to move inventory and employees down the road to Bass Pro Shops.
 Monday’s closure comes almost five years after the popular outdoor retailer set up shop just behind Costco off the 353 exit in Fort Oglethorpe in May of 2015.
 A few months after that, competitor Bass Pro Shops opened its doors just across the state line in East Ridge, Tenn.
 Then, in 2017, Bass Pro Shops purchased Cabela’s, which created the reality of having two stores owned by the same company a mere two and a half miles apart from one another.
 According to officials with Bass Pro Shops, the company looks to provide a larger assortment of goods at the East Ridge store and will offer employment to “virtually all” of the displaced workers impacted by the Cabela’s closure.
 “By bringing these brands together, we can better serve our customers with greater product assortment, value and local expertise in a single location,” the company stated in an official statement Monday.
 The company says it plans to update signage at the Bass Pro Shops location, which will include the Cabela’s logo, as well as that of the Tracker brand.
 Following the announcement of the closure, Catoosa County Economic Development Authority (EDA) Director Keith Barclift issued a statement expressing the county’s desire to help secure future employment for workers who may be out of a job.
 “It is my understanding that employees at Cabela's will be offered comparable positions at the East Ridge Bass Pro Shop,” Barclift said. “However our primary goal is the ability of our citizens to find gainful employment. Therefore, we are working with the Georgia Department of Labor to ensure that any employee that is displaced by this announcement is able to find another job. We will have information on our website for anyone needing GDOL assistance.”
 When Cabela’s initially wanted to develop in Catoosa County, the EDA provided a $1.5 million subsidy with the plan to recoup that money in sales tax and property tax revenue over a seven-year period following the store’s opening.
 According to Barclift, the county was able to recoup that investment five years ahead of schedule in 2017.
 “Catoosa County has verified that all of the developer’s financial performance goals under the Site Development Agreement were satisfied as of December 31, 2017, approximately five years ahead of schedule,” Barclift said. “Not only have the developer’s obligations been met and the Development Authority’s site development costs been re-paid, the sales and property tax revenues from the Cabela’s site have exceeded any financial investment made by the Development Authority.”
 For consumers looking to purchase outdoor equipment provided by the company, Bass Pro Shops is located at 638 Camp Jordan Parkway off I-75 exit 1 in East Ridge, Tenn.
 Officials with the company say Bass Pro Shops will continue to redeem Cabela’s gift cards, and earn or redeem points from CLUB credit and Outdoor Rewards cards at the Bass Pro Shops location.
