 # OKWU basketball teams set to be home Saturday afternoon
 Mike Tupa
 Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise
 So far, so good for Oklahoma Wesleyan University's scheduled basketball doubleheader Saturday at home.
 The men play at 2 p.m. against McPherson (Kan.) College, while the Lady Eagles followed at 4 p.m. against Tabor (Kan.) College.
 The OKWU men haven't been on the court since Dec. 2 — and prior to that since Nov. 17.
 They boast a 5-2 record, including a 3-1 mark in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference.
 The Eagles are riding a three-game winning streak — but it will cover 29 days by the time Saturday's game starts.
 McPherson men come in with a winning overall record (4-3), but are 2-3 in the KCAC.
 They are on a three-game losing streak, including a two-point setback this week at Kansas Wesleyan.
 The OKWU ladies are coming off a 70-50 victory earlier this week against Avila (Mo.).
 The Lady Eagles are 4-6 overall and 3-5 in the KCAC.
 Tabor has carved out a record of 4-4 (3-3).
 This is obviously an important contest for both teams as they try to move up in the pecking order in the early conference standings.
 Next up, the OKWU teams are slated to travel Monday to Bethany (Kan.) College.

Manchester United eased the mounting pressure on manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but an uninspired 0-0 draw with Manchester City on Saturday did little for either side's chances of mounting a Premier League title challenge.


  United remain a point better off than their local rivals in the table but sit seventh, five points off Tottenham and Liverpool at the top of the table, while City slip to ninth.


  Solskjaer's men may well be the happier side to take a point after crashing out of the Champions League at the group stages with a defeat to RB Leipzig on Tuesday.


  But the Red Devils have won just one of their opening six home league games this season and look set for another campaign where a top-four finish rather than a title tilt will be the target.


  City recorded a sixth straight clean sheet as Pep Guardiola has set about improving their defensive record.


  However, that has come at the cost of the thrilling football that City showed in their two title-winning campaigns under the Catalan in 2017/18 and 2018/19.


  Both sides were cautious throughout as the first Manchester derby without a crowd never sparked into life.


  United only seriously threatened from corners as Scott McTominay, who scored the last goal at Old Trafford in front of fans when the sides last met in March, was inches away from connecting with Victor Lindelof's near post flick- on.


  Lindelof and Harry Maguire also headed off target from set-pieces, but it was City who created the better chances on the few occasions they moved the ball at pace.


  Gabriel Jesus fired over from Riyad Mahrez's ball over the top, but it was Mahrez who was guilty of passing up the best opening when he fired too close to David de Gea after brilliant work by Jesus and Kevin De Bruyne.


  The visitors were handed a reprieve early in the second-half when Kyle Walker was penalised for clipping Marcus Rashford inside the area.


  A VAR review showed Rashford was offside as he received the ball and United were denied a 32nd penalty in the last two seasons.


  City pushed the hosts back, but continued to lack the precision and penetration to cause the United defence problems.


  De Bruyne always looked the most likely candidate to produce a winner and the Belgian's goalbound shot was bravely blocked by Maguire.


  At the other end, Bruno Fernandes took two pot shots from outside the box, but the Portuguese's first effort was easily saved by Ederson and the second ended up closer to the corner flag than the top corner to sum up a miserable match.

THE FACTS: During a Senate hearing Tuesday, a group of doctors touted alternative COVID-19 treatments, including ivermectin and the anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine. Medical experts have cautioned against using either of those drugs to treat COVID-19. Studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine has no benefit against the coronavirus and can have serious side effects. There is no evidence ivermectin has been proven a safe or effective treatment against COVID-19. Yet Dr. Pierre Kory, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Aurora St Luke’s Medical Center in Milwaukee, described ivermectin as a “wonder drug” with immensely powerful antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents at the hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Clips of Kory’s comments on ivermectin during the hearing were shared widely on social media with one clip receiving more than 1 million views on YouTube. Ivermectin is approved in the U.S. in tablet form to treat parasitic worms as well as a topical solution to treat external parasites. The drug is also available for animals. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health have said that the drug is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. According to the FDA, side effects for the drug include skin rash, nausea and vomiting. Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University, said most of the research around ivermectin at the moment is made up of anecdotes and studies that are not the gold standard in terms of how to use ivermectin. “We need to get much more data before we can say this is a definitive treatment,” he said. “We would like to see more data before I recommend it to my patients.” Kory told the AP that he stands by the comments he made at the hearing, saying that he was not trying to promote the drug but the data around it. In June, Australian researchers published the findings of a study that found ivermectin inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting, which is not the same as testing the drug on humans or animals. Following the study, the FDA released a letter out of concern warning consumers not to self-medicate with ivermectin products intended for animals. “It is a far cry from an in vitro lab replication to helping humans,” said Dr. Nasia Safdar, medical director of infection prevention at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Hospital. The discussion about the drug in the Senate hearing has some experts worried that Americans will start buying up ivermectin out of desperation. Despite a majority of evidence showing hydroxychloroquine is not an effective COVID-19 treatment, there was a rush on that drug earlier this year after President Donald Trump called it a cure. That depleted supply for those who needed the medication to treat lupus and other conditions. “If there is one thing we have learned in the pandemic is that we cannot jump the gun as far as determining or making assumptions about the effectiveness of potential agents,” Safdar said.

There was voter fraud. That is not opinion, it is fact. My fans are probably looking sideways at the newspaper. Scotty, you’re an incredibly logical and rational person, how could you make a bogus claim?
 I didn’t say the fraud would overturn the election, but there was some level of fraud took place. Anyone who claims otherwise just needs to look at the number of people who voted on Election Day who were already dead. So the question is whether or not there was enough verifiable fraud to skew the results. If there was I am sure we’d know by now.
 Within a week after Election Day, I started getting informed in the Twittersphere that “tomorrow” the election fraud will be revealed. Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor, said she was going to unleash the Kraken.
 One of the conspiracy theories was the U.S. military seized a server that was used by Dominion, the election machine company, to store results. The military had found the actual vote counts and President Trump had won in a landslide. How fun and exciting!
 The electoral map created based on the seized server showed nearly every state was red — including California. Anyone with any of their five senses intact knows a red California is a complete farce. Busted! Even if the rest of the story sounded believable you lost most people with that whopper.
 For several weeks Powell was the darling of conservative social media. The right-leaning users believed she was the savior of the Trump presidency. There is no way she would throw her career in the garbage, people reasoned. She had to have something incredibly valuable. I am still waiting to see what it is. I guess that will be tomorrow.
 There has been a lot of chatter about the fact that several states all stopped counting votes in the middle of the night. I have followed a lot of elections over the years. I cannot remember a large number of states ceasing their vote counting like this. When they stopped counting, these states had a large lead for Trump. The next morning Biden had made up massive ground and taken the lead.
 Was that evidence of fraud? At the very least it seemed fishy.
 There is a belief that Dominion and the election workers conspired to change a vote counting algorithm. It was for that reason the counting had to stop. They needed time to install this algorithm which would take a portion of the votes for Trump and change some to Biden and some to the third party candidates.
 Has anyone watched the video of the vote counting in Georgia? It supposedly shows the election officials having everyone leave under the guise that the counting was done for the night. After everyone left a bunch of suitcase- looking containers were pulled out from under a table. It appears that ballots were stored in those containers.
 The counting started again, but there were no election observers to watch what was happening. Maybe that was the proof of the election fraud we have been told about. I don’t know. The state officials have said everything was on the up and up.
 I have heard about all sorts of signed affidavits that alleged voter fraud. I am not saying the affiants are lying about what they saw. I think they believe what the saw was voter fraud. But believing you saw fraud and actual fraud taking place are very different.
 I want a smoking gun. I want to see the algorithm on the Dominion machine that changed the votes. It is not enough to claim that it could happen. I would have loved for the Kraken to have been unleashed. But it has not been released and I don’t think it will be.
 With that all said, watch for the lawsuit filed by Texas. That could cause some fireworks.
