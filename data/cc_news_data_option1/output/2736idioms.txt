After dedicating a recent column to directors, all of whom were men, a reader suggested I write a column on women directors.
 I thought that was an excellent idea and initially set out to write a column on great women directors. However, during my research, I discovered there are a LOT of great women directors, starting from the dawn of film to the present day. In only a few minutes, I had compiled a list of more than 50 directors that would have tuned this column into a novel. Suffice it to say, with newspaper space at a premium, my editor prefers columns on a more modest scale.
 So to keep the length manageable, I decided to focus on four of my favorite female directors and listing two of their films that have been considered artistic or commercial successes - or both. These may not be the greatest women directors of all time, but they have made great films. Well, at least in my humble opinion.
 For some background, women have been directing movies for as long as there have been movies, starting right at the beginning with Alice-Guy Blache. Other notables who followed her include Lois Weber and Dorothy Arzner. Basically, women have always been directing movies. They just haven't been directing as many as men or received similar recognition. Why? Name your theory, starting with sexism as Hollywood has long been an all-boys club.
 Female directors certainly have been shortchanged during awards season. Case in point, in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards, only five women have been nominated as best director, and only one has taken home Oscar - Kathryn Bigelow for "The Hurt Locker" in 2009. They don't fare much with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, In that organization's 76-year history, only five women have been nominated best director and only one has taken home the Golden Globe - Barbra Streisand for "Yentl" in 1983.
 So, come on Hollywood, get with the program. Does Wonder Woman have to smash this glass ceiling? OK, enough background and proselytizing. Here are two of my fab four female directors.
 Let's start with IDA LUPINO. Fed up with what was happening to her career in front of the camera - too many substandard films - she decided to go behind it, becoming an independent filmmaker to boot.
 For two of her best movies, check out "The Bigamist" and "The Hitch-Hiker," both from 1953 and starring Edmond O'Brien. In the former, O'Brien plays Harry Graham, a traveling salesman in a successful business he runs with his wife, Eve, played by Joan Fontaine. Eve wants a child, but she's infertile, so the couple goes to an adoption agency run by Mr. Jordan played Edmund Gwenn. To make sure the Grahams are suitable parents, Mr. Jordan does some investigating and discovers, much to his shock, that Harry is also married to Phyllis Martin, played by Lupino, a woman he met on one of his trips. And they have a child.
 Oh my. Infertility, adultery, bigamy, a child conceived out of wedlock. Let's just say these aren't your typical topics found in films from the 1950s. This is the only movie Lupino directed and appeared in, and it's a gem, featuring top-notch acting by all the principals. The film even displays a sense of humor. In one scene, Harry and Phyllis are taking a bus tour of movie stars' homes and the bus driver points out the home of Edmund Gwenn. Is it really his house? Who cares? It's a nice, light touch.
 By the way, the film was written and co-produced by Collier Young, who was married at the time to Fontaine and was the former husband of Lupino. That must have been an interesting shoot.
 Anyway, as a director, Lupino often tackled subjects out of the mainstream, including rape and polio - a disease she was diagnosed with when she was 16.
 With "Hitch-Hiker," Lupino also ventured into film noir, and is credited as being the first woman director of an American mainstream film in that genre. Inspired by the real crime spree of Billy Cook, the film follows the murderous exploits of Emmett Myers (played by William Talman, who would later play district attorney Hamilton Burger on the "Perry Mason" TV series).
 Myers' MO was hitchhiking and then killing the people who offered him a ride. Two men (O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy) become his latest prey as he forces them to drive him from California to Mexico so he can escape the authorities. Of course, once he arrives at his destination, his driving companions aren't likely to remain upright and breathing. What are they going to do to escape that fate?
 Anyone who has watched Talman on "Perry Mason" will be amazed at what a great psychopath he plays here, and Lupino keeps the tension taught throughout. One can only imagine what she could have accomplished with bigger budgets. Later on, she became the only woman to direct an episode of "The Twilight Zone." Lupino died in 1995 at the age of 77.
 PENNY MARSHALL shot to fame as Laverne DeFazio on the "Laverne and Shirley" sitcom. She had previously played Myrna on "The Odd Couple," the TV show produced by her brother Garry, who later later direct "Pretty Woman." In one episode, her character married her boyfriend played by Rob Reiner, her real- life husband at the time.
 Like Reiner, Marshall transitioned to directing, too, literally hitting the big time, with "Big." The 1988 film became the first movie directed by a woman to gross more than $100 million at the U.S. box office. It also earned its star, Tom Hanks, the first of his Oscar nominations as best actor, and an Oscar nomination as best screenplay for Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg, Steven's sister.
 "Big" is, quite simply, a marvelous comedy with Hanks outstanding as the boy who gets his wish and becomes "big" with comic - and serious - consequences. His scene with Robert Loggia on the giant piano is just one of the film's many memorable moments. But a boy in an adult's body is going to go through some growing pains, so to speak, and Marshall deftly balances these hassles with humor. Considering her background, it's not surprising that she has an affinity for comedy.
 That said, Marshall was also adept at directing drama, as she proved in 1990s' "Awakenings," a film about a doctor's relationship with his catatonic patient. The movie received three Oscar nominations; best picture, best actor (Robert De Niro) and best screenplay (Steven Zaillian).
 But my other favorite Marshall film is another comedy: 1992's "A League of their Own," a fictionalized portrayal of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League that was started during World War II when many male baseball players were in the service. The film stars Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna and that Hanks guy again.
 The actresses play the ballplayers while the actor plays their reluctant, frequently drunk manager. Davis and Petty, as rival sisters, provide the drama while O'Donnell and Madonna serve up the comedy. Sure, if you're allergic to sentiment, the film might cause you to break out in hives, but it's so much darn fun, thanks to Marshall at the helm. She also shows that these girls - can we please call them women? - really could play. And just remember, there's no crying in baseball. Marshall died in 2018 at the age of 75.
 Stay tuned next month for Part 2 of my column on female directors.
