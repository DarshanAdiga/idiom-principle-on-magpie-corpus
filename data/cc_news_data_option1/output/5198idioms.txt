A deal that includes a second stimulus check is inching closer as Washington negotiators continue to hammer out the details for a new stimulus package. Even assuming a payment is approved, the IRS and Treasury won't be able to send the second stimulus checks all at once. In fact, there are still some people who, even eight months later, are waiting for their first stimulus check to arrive.


  We'll tell you everything we know about how long you might personally have to wait for your second stimulus check. But first, to make sure we're all on the same page, the latest discussion suggests that a second direct payment could top out at $600, which is half the $1,200 upper limit each eligible adult was qualified to receive with the first check.


  The situation is complicated and far from final. In fact, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, plans to petition for a $1,200 direct payment on Friday, he tweeted. There's also already talk of another stimulus package in 2021 to pick up what a smaller bill in 2020 would leave behind.

"If it was a little bit closer, I would have considered going for it," Gruden said. "I know I went for it a few times earlier in the game. But to take the lead with 3 minutes left, I thought was the play to make at that time."
 That proved costly when the Raiders defense couldn't stop the Chargers in the first game since firing coordinator Paul Guenther and replacing him with Rod Marinelli. The fourth penalty of the game on cornerback Trayvon Mullen and a 53-yard pass to Jalen Guyton set up Justin Herbert's 1-yard sneak that won it for the Chargers.
 That spoiled the big debut for Mariota. He threw for 226 yards and a TD and ran for 88 yards and a TD. He is the first player since at least 1948 to come off the bench and throw for at least 200 yards and a score and run for at least 50 and a score.
 It was the kind of performance that made him the No. 2 overall pick in Tennessee but one he didn't show enough with the Titans, leading him to lose his starting job last season to Ryan Tannehill and eventually land with the Raiders.
 "It's been a long journey," he said. "I've been through kind of everything from injuries to surgeries to mental kind of lapses and the confidence thing. I just truly appreciate the Raiders and the entire organization for kind of helping me through that. I was trying to kind of find my way again and they gave me an opportunity to kind of take some time. They're patient with me. I just appreciate the fact that they were willing to do that."

Robert Lewandowski conquistó su primer premio _The Best_ , que entrega la FIFA, al mejor futbolista del año 2020, en una votación en la que se impuso a Leo Messi y a Cristiano Ronaldo. No fue una sorpresa, como seguro tampoco lo fue para muchos la presencia de la compostelana Verónica Boquete, actualmente en el AC Milan, en el mejor once femenino del año. La santiaguesa, incomprensiblemente fuera de la selección española en las convocatorias de Jorge Vilda, sí cuenta con el reconocimiento del fútbol mundial y este premio se rinde a su talento, genialidad, experiencia y trabajo.
 Vero Boquete entró en el once que formaron Christiane Endler (PSG), Millie Bright (Chelsea), Lucy Bronze, Wendie Renard (Lyon), Barbara Bonansea (Juventus), Delphine Cascarino (Lyon), Harder (Chelsea), Tobin Heath (United), Miedema (Arsenal) y Rapinoe (OL Reign).
 Merecido también fue el premio de Lewandowski, punta de lanza de un Bayern de Múnich que lo ganó todo este año: Liga de Campeones, Bundesliga, Copa y Supercopa de Alemania y Supercopa de Europa. En una gala virtual, la FIFA entregó sus premios, aunque en mano solo lo recibió el ariete polaco, en la sorpresa del presidente de la FIFA. Infantino había dado el mensaje de bienvenida, pero apareció al final para entregar el premio a Lewandowski, quien como Messi y Cristiano. En la votación, la FIFA recoge la elección de entrenadores, capitanes, medios de comunicación y aficionados, para desarrollar una puntuación en la que Lewandowski ganó con 52 puntos, por los 38 de Cristiano y 35 de Messi.
 Como Mejor Jugadora salilió elegida la defensa inglesa Lucy Bronze (52), del Olympique, por delante de Harder (40) y Renard (35).
 La gala comenzó con un homenaje de la FIFA a los sanitarios de todo el mundo, con un vídeo de agradecimiento a su labor durante la pandemia para decirles “el fútbol está con vosotros”.
 El mejor once del año FIFA FIFPro, masculino también tuvo protagonismo español. Sergio Ramos fue elegido en el masculino junto a Thiago Alcántara. “Una de las claves mantener la ilusión y hambre de ganar, lo sigo manteniendo a pesar de haber ganado mucho”, dijo el internacional español del Real Madrid.
 El once lo completaron Becker (Liverpool), Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Davies (Bayern), Van Dijk (Liverpool), De Bruyne (Manchester City), Joshua Kimmich (Bayern), Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus), Lewandowski y Lionel Messi (FC Barcelona).
 La gala estuvo también marcada por el homenaje a los recientemente fallecidos Maradona y Rossi.
 La mayor sorpresa de la gala fue el premio a Jürgen Klopp como mejor entrenador del 2020. El técnico alemán repite el galardón del año pasado, aunque el favorito al preparador del Bayern Hansi Flick.

Former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Thursday hit out at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for insulting the farmers' struggle with "cheap theatrics by tearing copies of the farm laws" which he was among the first to notify in the country.In a statement here, Badal said the Delhi Chief Minister was known as a "dramabaaz" but this time he had indulged in unparalleled hypocrisy by tearing the same laws in the Vidhan Sabha which he had notified on November 23.Asking Kejriwal to have mercy on the farmers, she said it was strange that the Delhi CM had only suddenly discovered that farmers were sitting out in the open in cold wave conditions and that more than twenty farmers had passed away. "The Delhi chief minister is only shedding crocodile tears in a desperate bid to wipe away the blot he has put on his name by rushing to notify the farm laws on the directions of the central government. These dramas however will not help. Farmers know that Kejriwal and AAP have never supported their struggle and that Kejriwal has always danced to the tune of the central government".The Bathinda lawmaker said asserted that it was not the first time that Kejriwal had tried to "befool" farmers. "Earlier also the Delhi Chief Minister first notified the hated farm laws secretly and when this fact came out in the open he tried to win the sympathy of farmers by going in for a farcical inspection of a few toilets near the Singhu border. This latest antics of tearing copies of the farm laws has also been done to save AAP's sinking ship in Punjab where the party has been thoroughly discredited and become redundant. Such low-level tactics will not help. Punjabis have seen through AAP and will never trust the party every again", she added. While tearing the copies of the three recently enacted farm laws in the special assembly session, Kejriwal on Thursday had accused BJP of bringing these laws to get funds for elections. "BJP has made the elections very costly in the last few years. The farm laws have been made by the BJP for getting funds for elections," he had said.Hundreds of farmers are protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 26 against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

Trump’s perverse definition of “courage” and “right,” of course, amounts to a willingness to bend truth to his will and prize his continuation in office over American democracy.
 Yet against this madness, we have witnessed many acts of genuine courage. Of people of both parties bravely doing right.
 Secretaries of state and election authorities in the contested states, Republicans and Democrats, have weathered death threats and vows of political retribution simply for doing their jobs and counting, recounting and certifying the vote. They have shown enormous courage and deserve our gratitude and respect.
 Thousands of everyday Americans worked around the clock — in the midst of a pandemic and sometimes with the din of howling mobs in the background — to count and recount the votes. These patriotic Americans showed inspiring courage.
 So, too, did the governors who loyally campaigned for Trump but refused to bow to his threats and intimidation after the election.
 Yes, they were simply doing what the law required and democracy demands by certifying the vote in their states. But these officials acted knowing that in the hothouse of Trump’s Republican Party, doing their duty now could cost them their jobs in primaries later.
 Dozens of judges — some appointed by Trump — have summarily dismissed his ferocious, groundless assault on the election results. They have shown gratifying fidelity to the law.
 Trump has made clear from the very start of his presidency that he believed that every branch, every person in government, should be beholden to him before the law and their oaths of office.
 He told us before the election, in rushing through the Supreme Court confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, that he wanted nine justices to rule on election disputes. His implication was clear: My justices. My way.
 But this very conservative Supreme Court would not (so far, at least) be enlisted in the profane and unconstitutional mission of overturning an election on his behalf.
 As they and other federal judges have lifetime appointments, perhaps it took less courage than it did for those elected officials who have risked their careers — and even their lives — to stand by the rule of law. But the justices deserve credit, too, for firmly and unanimously rejecting the absurd lawsuits Trump and his loyalists have pushed their way.
 Courageous, too, have been those handful of elected Republicans who have acknowledged the results, congratulated President-elect Joe Biden and urged a peaceful, orderly transition of power.
 But if we have seen acts of courage, we also have seen cowardice.
 Rudy Giuliani and the Trump legal team have debased themselves, our legal system and democracy by filing one frivolous lawsuit after another, crying fraud on TV — but not in the courtroom, where evidence is required.
 And too many Republican officials, fearful of getting sideways with Trump’s base, have dutifully echoed his dishonest charges of vote fraud.
 A group of Republican state attorneys general lined up in support of a preposterous eleventh-hour filing from the attorney general of Texas, asking the Supreme Court to overturn the results in four states Trump lost.
 The suit was filed without standing, supporting evidence or a colorable argument. Nonetheless, Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana circulated an email among his Republican House colleagues urging them to sign an amicus brief in support of this outrageous folly. Trump is “anxiously awaiting the final list” to see who signs on to the amicus brief, Johnson wrote, implying dire consequences for anyone who failed join.
 Within 24 hours, more than 100 House Republicans complied.
 Supporters of Trump have gone so far as to argue that Republicans may stage a battle on the House floor to reject the Biden electors from contested states, a symbolic gesture that would fail but set a chilling precedent.
 Almost as egregious have been the many Republican members of the House and Senate who have refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory and countenanced weeks of delay in the transition.
 Through their silence, they have given credence to Trump’s blatant lies, which have now gained traction among a large majority of Republicans nationally.
 It’s crazy, authoritarian stuff. If it were occurring anywhere else, Americans would condemn it as an appalling attempt to undermine democracy.
 History will scorn the cowards who meekly complied with Trump’s scheme to tarnish and overturn the election — and honor the many who showed courage and fidelity to the rule of law during this time of trial.

Los Celtics confían en que el entrenador Brad Stevens, quien inicia su octavo año, pueda finalmente dar el paso que ha faltado, con la renovada alineación, tras pasar varias temporadas cerca de la serie en pos del 18vo título de la franquicia.


  Stevens no cree que las bajas más recientes de jugadores sean un indicio de lo que el equipo ha intentado construir.


  Casi toda la responsabilidad de lo que desean alcanzar recaerá en los hombros de Jayson Tatum y Jaylen Brown.


  Tatum, el único jugador en la historia de la NBA con 3.900 puntos, 1.300 rebotes y 400 triples en sus primeras tres campañas, asegura que su enfoque no cambia esta campaña tras ser elegido a su primer Juego de Estrellas.


  “No llego acá diciendo que es mi equipo. No adopto esa actitud”, dijo Tatum. “Como todos, me presento, llego a trabajar y hago lo que tengo hacer con mis habilidades. Salgo y juego. Creo que no necesito salir y decirlo”.


  LA SITUACIÓN DE WALKER


  Junto a Tatum y Brown, una de las grandes razones por las que Boston tuvo éxito en la burbuja fue la forma en la que jugó el base Kemba Walker.


  En su primer año desde que firmó con Boston como agente libre, Walker promedió 20,4 puntos y 5,8 asistencias en la temporada regular. Pero casi dijo adiós a la postemporada con los Celtics, pues en julio se torció la rodilla izquierda durante un entrenamiento antes de que se reanudara la campaña.


  NUEVAS INCORPORACIONES


  Los Celtics también reclutaron ayuda en la canasta, firmando a Tristan Thompson por dos años. Llenará el espacio que quedó vacante después de que Enes Kanter se fue para firmar con Portland.


  Thompson fue uno de seis aleros que promediaron un doble doble encestando al menos el 50% de sus tiros la temporada pasada.

I never realized I would have the desire to be a stay-at-home mom or work part-time until I became a

  For the last several years, I have chosen to work swing shifts so I can be available for my children during the mornings.


  But this has taken such a toll on my health that I have had to get antidepressant prescriptions to cope with juggling all of this.


  Recently, I told my husband I would like to work an earlier shift so my health can improve.


  Again he insists this is unacceptable because of the reduced pay I’d receive


  plus the high cost of child care.


  He’s a wonderful father to the children, and aside from this sole issue, we have no other problems. He makes me feel like a work mule, though, always trying to squeeze every last dollar out of me I can earn. I don’t want a divorce. I do love him. I’m considering telling him my job is requiring me to switch shift times, which isn’t true. Is it ever appropriate and acceptable to be dishonest to your spouse?

WASHINGTON — Federal authorities expressed increased alarm Thursday about a long-undetected intrusion into U.S. and other computer systems around the globe that officials suspect was carried out by Russian hackers. The nation's cybersecurity agency warned of a “grave” risk to government and private networks.


  The hack compromised federal agencies and “critical infrastructure” in a sophisticated attack that was hard to detect and will be difficult to undo, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in an unusual warning message. The Department of Energy acknowledged it was among those that had been hacked.


  The attack, if authorities can prove it was carried out by Russia as experts believe, creates a fresh foreign policy problem for President Donald Trump in his final days in office.


  Trump, whose administration has been criticized for eliminating a White House cybersecurity adviser and downplaying Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, has made no public statements about the breach.


  President-elect Joe Biden, who will inherit the potentially difficult U.S.-Russia relationship, spoke up forcefully about the hack, declaring that he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris “will make dealing with this breach a top priority from the moment we take office.”


  “We need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyberattacks in the first place,” he said. “We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in coordination with our allies and partners.”


  “There’s a lot we don’t yet know, but what we do know is a matter of great concern,” he said. He thanked administration “public servants” who he said were “working around the clock to respond to this attack.”


  CISA officials did not respond to questions and so it was unclear what the agency meant by a “grave threat” or by “critical infrastructure” possibly targeted in the attack that the agency previously said appeared to have begun last March. Homeland Security, the agency's parent department, defines such infrastructure as any “vital” assets to the U.S. or its economy, a broad category that could include power plants and financial institutions.


  The agency previously said the perpetrators had used network management software from Texas-based SolarWinds to infiltrate computer networks. Its new alert said the attackers may have used other methods, as well.


  Over the weekend, amid reports that the Treasury and Commerce departments were breached, CISA directed all civilian agencies of the federal government to remove SolarWinds from their servers. The cybersecurity agencies of Britain and Ireland issued similar alerts.


  A U.S. official previously told The Associated Press that Russia-based hackers were suspected, but neither CISA nor the FBI has publicly said who is believed to be responsible. Asked whether Russia was behind the attack, the official said: “We believe so. We haven’t said that publicly yet because it isn’t 100% confirmed.”


  Another U.S. official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that is under investigation, said the hack was severe and extremely damaging although the administration was not yet ready to publicly blame anyone for it.


  “This is looking like it’s the worst hacking case in the history of America,” the official said. “They got into everything.”


  At the Department of Energy, the initial investigation revealed that malware injected into its networks via a SolarWinds update has been found only on its business networks and has not affected national security operations, including the agency that manages the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile, according to its statement. It said vulnerable software was disconnected from the DOE network to reduce any risk.


  The intentions of the perpetrators appear to be espionage and gathering information rather than destruction, according to security experts and former government officials. If so, they are now remarkably well situated.


  Thomas Bossert, a former Trump Homeland Security adviser, said in an opinion article in The New York Times that the U.S. should now act as if the Russian government had gained control of the networks it has penetrated. “The actual and perceived control of so many important networks could easily be used to undermine public and consumer trust in data, written communications and services,” he wrote.”


  Members of Congress said they feared that taxpayers’ personal information could have been exposed because the IRS is part of Treasury, which used SolarWinds software.


  Tom Kellermann, cybersecurity strategy chief of the software company VMware, said the hackers are now “omniscient to the operations” of federal agencies they’ve infiltrated “and there is viable concern that they might leverage destructive attacks within these agencies” in reaction to U.S. response.


  Among the business sectors scrambling to protect their systems and assess potential theft of information are defense contractors, technology companies and providers of telecommunications and the electric grid.

The third level where you need to have optimism as part of innovation is that, as I said, with my own experience, which I actually think I’ve been fortunate to have that experience, is that you are going to not get what you want a lot. You are going to have a direction that you need to go to and you’re not going to have that set three months timeline where you come up with the next big thing. You’re going to have to learn that you have setbacks and you have to course correct and you have to problem solve, and you have to keep going and you have to have the energy to keep going. And you have to have the resilience to pivot and do something else without feeling badly about not going in your direction. So if I’m spending a lot of time saying, “Plan A really didn’t work,” and I’m lamenting on that and I’m beating myself up about that and I’m saying my team isn’t good, then I’m missing the opportunity for Plan B, which is the opposite of what you need, if you are an innovator.

Because the two tanks are connected to entirely independent parts of the water distribution system, both can be taken offline at the same time during the project.


  He also noted the Prince Street tank currently only sports the seal of the city of Brunswick, a throwback to a time when the city managed its own water and sewer services. The Brunswick seal will remain, but a JWSC logo will be branded on the opposite side.


  The JWSC took over county and city utilities in 2008.


  Utility Commissioners Donald Elliot, Wayne Neal, Cornell Harvey, Charles Cook, Robert Duncan, Tripp Stephens and Chairman Ben Turnipseed voted to award the $876,837 contract to Tank Pro LLC of Alabama.


  Commissioners also approved a $29,500 contract with Chapman Technical Services LLC to conduct inspections during the tank repair project. The company has handled water tank inspections for the utility for several years.


  The contractor should begin working on both simultaneously in the near future and finish in about four months, Burroughs said.


  The last contract, to handle engineering and construction administration on an Arnold Road sewer main replacement project, was awarded to T.R. Long Engineering in the amount of $38,235.


  Even after the contracts let on Thursday, Duncan said the utility is a little behind on its capital projects agenda.


  After the meeting, Burroughs told The News the JWSC has around 17 projects priced at $6.8 million in total scheduled for the fiscal year 2020-2021. All but three are underway, he said, and the utility should be caught up by the first calendar quarter of 2021. He acknowledged some projects might overlap with the next fiscal year, which begins in July 2021.


  Utility commissioners also voted unanimously to take out a second loan from the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, this time in the amount of $7.5 million.

TUSCALOOSA — The closest Mac Jones got to the Heisman Trophy was when he was a kid and met the 2007 winner at a mall in Florida.


  Florida quarterback Tim Tebow posed for a picture with a young Jones and his family next to the trophy. He even signed it for him.


  “I think we still have it somewhere in the house,” Jones said. “It was a cool experience and I really looked up to him when I was younger.”


  Jones could get a lot closer to the trophy in a few weeks, and this time it could be his. The Alabama quarterback is likely to be a Heisman finalist, and some experts have the Bama star as the favorite to win.


  He’s got competition, of course. From his own teammate.


  DeVonta Smith has put up eye-popping receiving numbers (1,327 yards, 15 touchdowns) and his Heisman stock has been rising for several weeks. Then there is Kyle Trask, the Florida quarterback who has the best chance outside of Jones to win the Heisman.


  The country will get to watch both in action in Saturday's SEC championship game in Atlanta when the No. 1 Crimson Tide takes on the No. 11 Gators.


  The quarterbacks are similar in some ways. Each has 3,000-plus passing yards, both are accurate with their passes, and they had to sit on the bench and wait their turn as the starter.


  Jones had to wait behind two star players, Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa, now starters in the NFL. For Trask, he had to wait in the wings behind Feleipe Franks for a year-and-a-half before winning the job in 2019.


  They easily could have transferred and started somewhere else, but chose patience instead.


  “I just wanted to stick it out and try to get better and help my team eventually,” Jones said. “I think a lot of quarterbacks did that. I think Kyle is a great example. At the end of the day you just make a choice for you and your family."


  The decision to stay put has paid off well for both. Jones is No. 1 in the nation in pass efficiency (203.9), No. 2 in completion percentage (76.4), and No. 4 in passing yards (3,321). Trask is tops in the land in passing yards (3,717) and touchdowns (40).


  “I have a lot of respect for Kyle and what he’s done and how he handles himself,” Jones said. “Eventually we both got our chances to help out our teams, and obviously Kyle has done a great job all year and he’s a great player. I definitely look to him as one of the best quarterbacks in the nation.”


  The SEC title game could be the deciding factor in the Heisman race. Trask didn’t have his best effort in a loss against a depleted LSU team last week. He did pass for more than 400 yards, but threw two interceptions with a fumble and four sacks. Jones didn’t light it up either in Alabama’s rout of Arkansas, but he was an efficient 24-of-29 with no interceptions and no sacks.


  For Jones, the Heisman talk is just that — talk. The ultimate prize is an SEC title, and hopefully another Alabama national championship.


  “We are not focused on that right now,” Jones said. “At Alabama, we are just trying to win games. The awards stuff will take care of itself.”

I was at the art fair, selling my book, when an incident that happened many years ago came to me. Back in the sixties, there was only two of us patrolling the city of Rome.


  It was on a Christmas Eve when it happened, my regular partner was off that night, and the captain gave me a partner whom we all called Bookie. As some of the older police remember, Bookie smoked cigars. He kept one in his mouth about all the time. There is nothing quite as bad as a wet cigar in a closed car.


  It was Christmas Eve, and everything was quiet. Most people were at home setting up Christmas for their little ones. Everything had closed at midnight, so when I first came on, I had gone by Krystal and picked up a couple of sandwiches. I had about all the wet cigar smoke I could take. I went up to the Civic Center where I was going to eat my sandwiches.


  I made the turn on the lot from the road, and as I did I saw a movement in one of the windows. I gave the car the gas and drove up to where you go beside the building on the duck pond side. I jumped from the car and began to check the windows and the door. All was secure, and I went back to the car.


  Bookie sat in the car puffing on the wet cigar. Bookie knew my name but never called me Lonie, it was always Lonzo.


  “What you looking for Lonzo?” he asked.


  “Santa Claus,” I replied.


  I made another round checking the windows and doors again. I couldn’t find anything out of order so I went back to the car. I reached in and got my sandwiches from the seat and placed them on the hood. I started to eat, never taking my eyes off of the Civic Center. Bookie sat in the car puffing on his wet cigar.


  I was looking at the window on the end of the building when I saw it again. I didn’t say anything but walked over and looked into the building. Nothing moved, but I knew that I had seen someone or something move. I walked back over to the car and opened the door to get in and started to sit down but changed my mind. I reached and got the microphone.


  I remember the conversation as if was yesterday.


  “Car two to headquarters” I said.


  “Go ahead car two” the dispatcher said.


  “Headquarters call the city custodian and tell him to bring the keys to the Civic Center,” I requested.


  A slight hesitation then, “you know this is Christmas Eve?” I was beginning to get a little irritated with the radio and Bookie’s wet cigar.


  I remember with the irritation showing, I said “life goes on, tell Paul to get over here as soon as possible.”


  Car one, having no calls, pulled on to the lot. I went over to the car and told them what I had seen. They pulled to the end where they could see half of the Civic Center. I picked up my cold sandwich and coffee. I ate and drank coffee, smelling Bookies’ wet cigar.


  It seemed that Paul would never get there, but finally I saw his headlights as he came off of the road on the lot. I motioned for the officers in the other car to come with me to help search the building. I went through the door with the others behind me. We searched every corner of the building even looking in the refrigerator.


  Nothing seemed to be out of place and no one could be found. The room had been set up for a party the next day. A Christmas tree was sitting in the front of the fireplace. Gifts were scattered around the tree. Sitting in the fire place was a bag of gifts. The bag looked out of place. The other officers had gone back to their car leaving Paul and I alone. That is all except Bookie with his wet cigar.


  I started to go toward the door to leave when a thought came to me. I motion for Paul to wait.


  “Bookie,” I said pointing to the fire place.


  A surprised look came on Bookie’s face. He laid his cigar on a table and with his gun in hand we approached the fire place. I stepped to the side and pulled the sack from the fire place. Nothing was in the fireplace, it was empty. I remember that a thought came to me.


  “Hey Paul,” I said “is it OK if I shoot up this fireplace to make sure that no one is hiding in it?”


  “Fire away,” he yelled loud enough for everyone to hear.


  A faint voice came from the fireplace, “don’t shoot mister, I am coming down.”


  “Come out showing me empty hands!” I ordered.


  I watched as a pair of shoes came into view, but I could not believe my eyes when the rest of him slid from the chimney. I will try to give you a description.


  A pair of shoes that looked to be about 14 in size came into sight with the longest body attached to them that I have ever seen. He had to be over 6 feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds. I wanted to laugh but knew this was no laughing matter. He had soot all over him and with his hand sticking up in the air was the funniest sight I remember seeing.


  “Face me,” I said, “with your hands held high!” Bookie took his cuffs and put them on him. We led him out to the car and placed him in the back seat. In those days there were no cages in the car; when someone was placed in the back seat, someone got in with them.


  Bookie started to get in then got out hollering at Paul. “Don’t lock the door. I got to get my cigar!” He went back into the Civic Center and retrieved his wet cigar stub.


  This fellow went by the name of Suge and in later years had half of the police department chasing him for burglary. He did time for the Civic Center burglary but came out and started up again.


  I always wondered if he thought he could get the big garbage bag up the chimney. The bag weighed as much as he did, if not more.


  I know that old Santa Claus can carry a big bag of toys down the chimney, but I would just bet that a six foot fellow weighing less than a hundred pounds could not make it up the chimney with a bag of toys as big as Suge had.

In an inspiring story, a physically challenged man from Pulwama district has started his own business against all odds. 34-year-old Arshid Ahmad Wani, who could hardly make ends meet, is now providing employment to a number of people at his joinery unit.
 A resident of Malpora, Litter village of the Pulwama, Wani was a carpenter by profession. In 2016, a tragedy took place and his life changed forever. While he was working on the rooftop of a cowshed, he lost his balance and fell on the boulders, which caused grievous injuries to his legs.
 Wani survived after the treatment, however, his both legs got paralysed. Having confined to a wheelchair for over two years, he got depressed. Finally, he decided not to give up and come up with the idea of opening a woodwork unit.
 As Wani was facing financial constraints, he later got a loan for his business and things are going pretty well for him now.
   
   
 "For some time, locals and a few relatives helped me for some time. Later, I realised that I should apply for a loan, and thanks to the then Deputy Commissioner Pulwama who appreciated my idea and helped me in getting the loan through District Industries Centre (DIC)," Wani said.
 "So far I have almost bought all the machines that I need for wood working. At present, six persons are working at his unit and he is receiving many orders to make doors and windows. I request handicapped people not to beg but move on and try to explore ways and means of starting their own ventures," he said.
 Mushtaq Ahmad, District Social Welfare Officer, Pulwama said that the district administration is also providing him a monthly pension.
 "He came here and we provided him a wheel chair. We are also giving him a monthly pension of Rs 1,000 per month. We also assisted him to get a loan from DIC. He has established a unit. This is a message for physically handicapped people. If they need help, we will provide them," he said.
 Yawar Magray, an employee of Wani's unit, lauded his owner's will power and extended gratitude to DIC for sanctioning a loan for him.
 "They set up a unit with the help of DIC. We make doors and windows. Many others are also working here. We are getting employment because of him. I am thankful to DIC for helping him," he said.

The likelihood that Trump will dance around the attribution issue is high, but whether or not he calls Russia out is a secondary point right now. I'm not holding my breath to see if Trump does the right thing -- he's leaving soon, and his track record shows that nothing he says about Russia is credible. What matters most is that his team is fully empowered to mitigate and investigate the attack and that they're authorized to fully brief the incoming administration.


  The US has stepped up offensive cyberoperations against Russian targets in the last year as a warning to Putin, but Russia has simply responded by escalating its attacks against the United States. While the US government was successful in defending the 2020 election from cyberattacks, the billions of dollars it spent on cybersecurity systems and new, cyberoffensive capabilities were not enough to avert (or detect) the latest breach.


  That's why, at a minimum, this is a PR win for Putin. The fact that these hackers were more sophisticated than even the Department of Homeland Security bolsters the broader Russian mission to broadcast our weaknesses and undermine confidence in the United States and our institutions. It's a perfectly tailored talking point for Russian influence operations.


  We shouldn't expect much from Trump on this. After Russia supported him in the 2016 election, he's avoided upsetting or confronting Putin, even on life and death issues like Russia putting bounties on US soldiers. In 2017, Trump even went so far as to tweet that he would form "an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded."


  It's clear that this is going to be Biden's problem, both in terms of cleaning up the mess and securing US government systems to make sure this doesn't happen again. In the unlikely event that the current Administration chooses to launch retributive cyberattacks against Russia in the next few weeks, Biden may find himself in the middle of an escalating cyberwar when he assumes office.


  That's why it is important that Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, and appropriate members of their team get all of the same information Trump does on this attack. It is also critical that the transition team is updated on investigative and mitigation efforts within the federal government, not to mention any policy responses under consideration.


  Biden's team will have to reckon with what to do. The President-elect released a statement Thursday saying, his administration would "elevate cybersecurity as an imperative across the government ... and expand our investment and the infrastructure and people we need to defend against malicious cyberattacks." He went on to say it was necessary to deter adversaries from making these attacks and said, "We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks." This suggests a range of policy responses from sanctions to potentially more offensive cyberops against Russia.


  Biden will also likely have a new, internal cybersecurity structure to work with. If the National Defense Authorization Act goes into effect, there will be a new cybersecurity czar in the federal government along with new authorizations affecting cybersecurity. Clearly, there will also have to be a review of how and why our cyberdefenses failed us across the board.


  Biden's relationship with Putin was always going to be complicated. But, unlike President Trump, Biden will approach that relationship informed by actual intelligence and unhindered by any personal political needs. When it comes to cybersecurity, Biden will have to rely on his team of experts to improve the US' defenses and come up with new ways to convince Putin that he needs to knock it off after Trump's legacy of defending us from Russia has proved to be an utter failure.

LONDON, - Google should voluntarily take action immediately to better vet paid-for promotions for financial products, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Thursday after a damning report on the watchdog's handling of a collapsed fund.      Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said Google should make checks with regulators to see whether potential advertisers had already been shut down in some other guise, before promotions are posted online.      "We believe some considerable effort could be put in to deal with how these are screened before they are allowed to advertise, with cross referencing with data bases that we run and international regulators run as well," Rathi told Reuters.     


  "There are steps that can be taken now," he said.      Rathi has met Google twice since taking office in October.      "There is a constructive discussion going on. I think what's important is action in this online space as well," he said.      Google said it had no immediate comment.      The FCA and Rathi's predecessor, now Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, were heavily criticised on Thursday in a report into the watchdog's "failures" in handling London Capital & Finance, an investment fund that collapsed last year.      LCF was regulated by the FCA and used Google to promote unregulated mini-bonds in a "misleading" way, the report ordered by the finance ministry said.      The FCA had told LCF in 2017 that its website and sponsored Google promotions were misleading, and also failed to contain a "capital at risk" warning, the report said.      But it was not until December 2018 that the FCA ordered LCF to withdraw all existing marketing for bonds, and the company collapsed a month later.      Britain's financial services minister John Glen said he will now consider whether paid-for advertising on online platforms should be regulated by rules on financial promotions.      Glen said that fraudulent online advertising could be designated as a "priority harm" under planned new laws on online content, meaning it would be policed by the FCA.     


  FCA Chair Charles Randell said the consumer investment market needs a careful review to spell out where investors are protected.      "In the long term, there is clearly a fundamental change in our society and in the way people engage with decisions, particularly online and the government recognises that," Randell said.

WASHINGTON — A government advisory panel endorsed a second COVID-19 vaccine Thursday, paving the way for the shot to be added to the U.S. vaccination campaign.


  The Food and Drug Administration is expected to follow the recommendation and quickly OK the vaccine from Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. The FDA advisers, in a 20-0 vote, agreed the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks for those 18 years old and up.


  Once emergency use authorization is granted, Moderna will begin shipping millions of doses, earmarked for health workers and nursing home residents, to boost the largest vaccination effort in U.S. history.


  The campaign kicked off earlier this week with the first vaccine OK'd in the U.S., developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Moderna’s shot showed similarly strong effectiveness, providing 94% protection against COVID-19 in the company’s ongoing study of 30,000 people.


  After eight hours of discussion over technical details of the company’s study and follow-up plans, nearly all panelists backed making the vaccine available to help fight the pandemic. One panel member abstained.


  “The evidence that has been studied in great detail on this vaccine highly outweighs any of the issues we’ve seen,” said Dr. Hayley Gans of Stanford University Medical Center.


  A second vaccine is urgently needed as coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths climb to new highs ahead of the holidays. The U.S. leads the world in virus totals, with more than 1.6 million confirmed cases and more than 310,000 reported deaths.


  Moderna’s vaccine uses the same groundbreaking technology as Pfizer- BioNTech’s shot. Most traditional vaccines use dead or weakened virus, but both of the new vaccines use snippets of COVID-19’s genetic code to train the immune system to detect and fight the virus. Both require two doses; Moderna's are administered four weeks apart.


  The two new vaccines will hopefully help “break the back of the pandemic,” said Dr. Arnold Monto of the University of Michigan, who chaired the panel.


  Thursday's review came days after reports of apparent allergic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in two Alaska health workers. One person had a severe reaction, including shortness of breath, the other had less serious side effects, including lightheadedness.


  While the two vaccines use the same technology, they’re not identical, cautioned Moderna chief medical officer Dr. Tal Zaks. In particular, some of the lipids, or fats, used to coat the two vaccines are different.


  “I would not necessarily assume” that any reactions would be the same, he said.


  The FDA found no severe allergic reactions in Moderna’s data but flagged a slightly higher rate of less serious side effects — rash, hives, itching — among participants who got the vaccine, compared with those receiving a dummy shot.


  There were also three cases of Bell’s palsy, which temporarily paralyzes facial muscles, among vaccine recipients, compared with just one among those getting a dummy shot. The FDA review said the role of the shot in the vaccine group “cannot be ruled out.”


  An unanswered question is whether the vaccine also prevents people from symptomless infection — but Moderna found a hint that it may. Study participants had their noses swabbed prior to the second dose of either vaccine or placebo. At that one timepoint, swabs from 14 vaccine recipients and 38 placebo recipients showed evidence of asymptomatic infection, said Moderna’s Dr. Jacqueline Miller.


  Moderna is just starting to study its vaccine in children ages 12 to 17. Testing in younger children is expected to start early next year.


  After the FDA acts, U.S. officials plan to move out an initial shipment of nearly 6 million Moderna doses. The vaccine needs to be stored at regular freezer temperatures, but not the ultra-cold required for Pfizer-BioNTech’s shot.


  With the addition of Moderna’s vaccine, government officials project that 20 million Americans will be able to get their first shots by the end of December and 30 million more in January.


  Hundreds of millions of additional shots will be needed to eventually vaccinate the general public, which isn’t expected until the spring or summer. The government’s Operation Warp Speed program has orders for 200 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine. That’s on top of 100 million doses of the Pfizer- BioNTech vaccine. Officials are negotiating to purchase more doses of that vaccine and there are more vaccines in the pipeline.


  Like the first vaccine, Moderna’s will remain experimental as the company continues a two-year study needed to answer key questions, including how long protection lasts.


  One of the trickiest issues panelists debated was how to keep study volunteers who received a dummy shot from dropping out to get the real shot. Their participation is critical in order to have a comparison for long-term safety and effectiveness.


  Moderna proposed immediately alerting all those volunteers of their status and offering them the vaccine. The company said more than 25% of its participants are health workers and some are already leaving to get the Pfizer vaccine.


  But Dr. Steven Goodman, an invited expert from Stanford University, suggested Moderna adopt Pfizer's approach. That company plans to gradually vaccinate people in its placebo group based on when they would have normally had access to the vaccine, as priority groups are established.


  But most panelists acknowledged it will be hard to keep volunteers from leaving the Moderna study if they have to wait to get a shot.


  “The reality may make that too difficult to do,” said Dr. Steven Pergam of the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.

TUSCALOOSA — The last time Alabama faced a high-powered passing offense, it didn’t end well.


  The Crimson Tide did defeat Ole Miss, but it wasn’t because of its defensive effort. Alabama gave up a season-high 48 points and 365 pass yards in the 63-48 decision.


  The defense is much improved since that October game, but Alabama has another matchup with an elite passing offense in the SEC championship game on Saturday.


  Florida meets the Crimson Tide for the 10th time in SEC title game history (Alabama leads 5-4), and this Gator squad has some of the most dangerous playmakers Alabama has seen this year.


  “They're all special,” Alabama defensive back Patrick Surtain said. “They do things differently. They all have their different qualities. But they are all playmakers. We know it's going to be a challenge.”


  The Gators’ list of playmakers starts at quarterback with Kyle Trask, who has all the gaudy passing stats you would expect from a Heisman Trophy hopeful — 3,717 yards, 40 touchdowns and a 70% completion rate.


  One of the big playmakers Trask has targeted this season is Kyle Pitts. The tight end’s 11 receiving touchdowns leads the team, and he’s second with 641 yards with 36 catches.


  The 6-foot-6, 240-pound junior wasn’t on the field last week for the Gators’ stunning loss to LSU. He was held out for health reasons, but said he was ready to go at game time.


  “I was planning to play up until then,” Pitts said. “Then they told me it was best that I don't. I went along with the decision.”


  He’s not missing Saturday’s game for sure.


  “That's the plan,” Pitts said.


  The primary target for Trask is receiver Kadarius Toney, who was recruited by Alabama.


  “He's a difficult matchup, creates a lot of problems,” Alabama coach Nick Saban said. “We'd love to have him here I can tell you that.”


  Florida has talent all across the offense, but it’s not as if Alabama lacks its own truckload of playmakers. The Crimson Tide has a couple of Heisman hopefuls in quarterback Mac Jones and receiver DeVonta Smith. They are one of the nation's most dynamic duos, and have connected for 15 touchdowns.


  Alabama also has a weapon in the backfield, something that has limited Florida’s offensive scheme at times. Najee Harris has more than 1,000 yards on the ground with some big catches as well.


  "They can do it through the running game, they can do it through the short passing game with getting the ball to their athletes in space, letting them go make big plays, or they can do it with shots deep down the field,” Florida coach Dan Mullen said.

After departing his boyhood club Everton in 2004 to join the Red Devils, he returned to Goodison Park in 2017 before moving to DC United in MLS.
 While he played in the nation's capital, his son made his first major highlight in a youth soccer game, scoring a long distance free kick that was reminiscent of his dad's prime. Kai celebrated as only a kid could: running towards the corner flag, jumping and spinning before landing on the ground and quickly getting back up.

 “We’ve heard from dozens of young people who are no longer able to sofa surf due to social distancing laws.

A Dec. 12 letter stated, "If even one person's death can be prevented by taking strict precautions then we take those precautions, no questions asked." This is consistent with ethical codes where the first and foremost responsibility is to the public welfare, as followed by many professions.
   
 Imagine the outcry if a business stated, "Our product has a dangerous defect, but it only impacts 4.4 percent of the population, and only 0.012 percent of the population will die as a result. All deaths are tragic, but this percent is not very high. The profits of our owners or shareholders, and the jobs of our employees, depend on our continued production of this product."
   
 I do disagree with one point in the Dec. 12 letter, "The point [that an earlier letter writer on Dec. 10] is making about the efficacy of a stringent lockdown of eating establishments may be valid." This referred to a statement that Indiana had fewer pandemic cases and deaths compared to population than Michigan.
   
 That earlier letter writer used data over the entire pandemic, not current data. The Brown University School of Public Health website shows a current (as of Dec. 10) seven-day moving average of cases per 100,000 people of 96.7 for Indiana, but only 63.2 for Michigan. It is factually false that Indiana currently has a lower rate of cases than Michigan.
   
 People who are concerned about the economic impact of shutdowns related to public health should contact their congressional representatives and request they address the short-term impact on small businesses and their employees, as was done earlier in the year.

It's impossible to do full damage control without knowing the extent of the damage -- and identifying who and what was compromised will take some time. SolarWinds may not have been the only access point, according to CISA, and intelligence analysts are still trying to map out what Russian hackers were able to glean from this attack.


  It's still unclear whether they were able to take intellectual property, access sensitive information, monitor US government activities, or even disrupt US government operations. Even if hackers only gained access to unclassified data like email addresses, that still is a major security risk, since they can then use that information to conduct more sophisticated phishing campaigns. And plenty of information on unclassified US government servers is still considered sensitive. Just the ability to see what is happening on these government servers could provide our attackers with intelligence that can give them an advantage in diplomatic negotiations, for example.


  The fact that this attack can be traced back to March and that as many as 18,000 entities may have been affected makes the "magnitude of this ongoing attack hard to overstate," according to Trump's former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert. This investigation will span months, at a minimum, and it will be handed to President-elect Biden the moment he enters office.


  An easier task at hand is attribution. Only a handful of nation-state actors have the ability to carry out a hack of this sophistication, and US officials and cybersecurity experts have identified specific indicators that point to the group APT29, or Cozy Bear, which has deep ties to Russian intelligence. Cozy Bear is a familiar name to anyone who has been tracking cybersecurity issues in recent years -- the same group recently tried to steal coronavirus vaccine research this summer. It was also suspected of breaching the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and successfully hacked the State Department and White House email servers during the Obama Administration. If news of this latest hack feels like a macabre "Groundhog Day" moment, it's because we've been here before.


  Yet, despite all the evidence that suggests Russia was responsible, we still haven't heard a peep from POTUS. Instead, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany gave a general response to a question about the attack, saying the US government is aware of the reports and "taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues." Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged that the attack was consistent with Russian efforts to breach American servers but refused to directly point the finger at Russian President Vladimir Putin.


  Based on my own experiences, I know it takes time to declassify intelligence about these kinds of attacks. But given information from the private sector and declassification protocols, it seems Trump could call out Russia if he wanted to. The problem is, he likes to placate Putin. With Trump leaving office during an ongoing Russian attack on the US government, it's now more clear than ever that he leaves behind a legacy of empowering Russia, rather than deterring it.

For the Raiders, the storyline quickly changed from must-win to stay alive in the playoff hunt, to how to win with backup Marcus Mariota seeing his first action as a Raider, while setting up a showdown of former University of Oregon quarterbacks.
 "It was a pretty crazy experience," Herbert said. "I grew up watching Marcus. He was my favorite player. To see him on the field and play against him was really cool. It's everything I've ever wanted."
 Just four days after firing defensive coordinator Paul Guenther, plus missing four starters on defense, and having their offensive coordinator Greg Olson sidelined after testing positive for COVID-19, the Raiders lost Carr when he came up lame on a third-down scramble near the goal line in the first quarter. Carr immediately went to the locker room and did not return.
 Mariota was poised in his return from the first snap.
 In his first drive, he was 3 for 3 for 70 yards and a perfectly placed over- the-top pass to Darren Waller. Mariota also scrambled for 11 yards for a first down.
 "When it comes down to it, I think it's part of your job to be prepared," Mariota said. "Just try to give these guys a chance to win and unfortunately we came up a little short."
 The sixth-year pro finished 17 of 28 for 226 yards with one TD and one interception. He also rushed for 88 yards on nine carries, including a touchdown.
 "It just shows the kind of player and football character he has," Raiders coach Jon Gruden said of Mariota. "You lose Derek, and we change gears offensively. Marcus came in and did a great job. I'm really proud of him. That just puts an exclamation point on why we signed him. Just wish we could have won the game for him."
 Los Angeles placekicker Michael Badgley missed two field goals near the end of the game -- one from 47 yards and one from 51 -- while the Raiders blew their chance when Mariota made his first bad decision of the game with an ill- advised pass that went off the hands of Zay Jones and into the hands Chris Harris Jr., who returned it 51 yards to give Badgley his second opportunity.
 Las Vegas lined up for a 65-yard, game-winning field goal at the end of regulation, but a bad snap was bobbled by AJ Cole, preventing Carlson from making an attempt.

Experts from the Bureau of Meteorology have suggested the strongest La Nina in a decade could bring showers and cooler temperatures for several major cities on December 25.Sydney is predicted to have a maximum temperature of 26C and a low of 19C, but showers scattered throughout the day and a chance of storms may dash hopes of a day at the beach.Rain is also expected to be on and off for Canberra, Brisbane, Hobart and Darwin.But it’s not all gloom at Christmas, with Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide set to welcome sunny skies and warm temperatures. Adelaide could even reach a maximum of 34C. Christmas Day is also expected to kick off a wet summer for large parts of the nation.Dr Lynette Bettio, from the Bureau of Meteorology, said that was due to the La Nina effect.“We have La Nina active in the tropical Pacific, so we have cooler waters in the east (combining with) warmer waters near Australia and that really brings more moisture into our region,” she said.“That increases the likelihood of above-average rainfall across Australia over the summer period.” Dr Claire McClusky, also from the bureau, said flooding was possible on the east coast of Australia. “In areas where soils are wet, with rain expected there is potential for widespread flooding, and we‘re seeing that play out in northeastern NSW,” McClusky said.“With increased risk of flooding in coming months, please keep up on our website and listen to emergency services.”

Birmingham City Council has partnered with Staywell Hospitality Management (SWHM) - which manages a range of high end hotels and apartments in the city - on the game-changing deal.


  It was created out of the pandemic crisis but with the aim of permanently upgrading the care given to crisis families.


  Birmingham City Council's homes and neighbourhoods lead Cllr Sharon Thompson, who experienced the ignominy of homelessness as a teenager, said it was fantastic news.


  It marks "a significant improvement to the standard of accommodation being provided to the homeless."


  "We have seen a dramatic rise in homelessness since the start of the pandemic, with more and more people having to be placed in B&Bs and other emergency housing right across the city," she said.


  “The pandemic has been a challenging time - this provides us with a real game changing opportunity to help people.


  “I’d personally like to thank SWHM for their generosity. While the pandemic led to initial talks between us, they’ve gone above and beyond in their commitment to homeless families.

The _Grey's_ _Anatomy_ season finale left fans with a giant cliffhanger Thursday night. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is in worse shape than before, and now that her fate hangs in the balance on a ventilator, fans are worried about the future of the show and its titular character. Since the show has included the coronavirus pandemic into this season's storyline, Meredith Grey sadly became the character to feel the disease's effects. While she was recovering from the virus, after the doctor jumped in to save another COVID patient from coding, she took a turn for the worse which has left her in a state of unconsciousness.
 Fortunately, that could mean more surprise cameos from her late husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and George (T.R. Knight) during her dreamscape beach visits. Unfortunately, answers won't be given as to Dr. Grey's future until the show resumes with a new season in March.
 The show's executive producers Andy Reaser and Meg Marinis spoke with Entertainment Tonight about the jaw-dropping finale and the future of the series.
 "We wanted to be as realistic as we possibly could about our portrayal of the virus and the dangers that it poses, and the COVID high or happy hypoxia is something that we've heard about again and again and again and again where you're like, 'Oh, we're all better,' and then the person, just on a dime, completely crashes," Reaser said of the writer's decision that shocked viewers. "It's not something that we take lightly and we don't want to feel like Meredith is being let off the hook too easily. The virus keeps everyone guessing and it's relentless, so it's going to take relentlessness to fight it."
 Without giving too many details of Grey's future on the series, Reaser did say the writers won't count out anymore surprise visits to Meredith's dreamscape beach spot. But the doctor's fate still hangs in the balance as viewers are left without a clear understanding of her mental capabilities, Reaser teases.
 "We want to say yes, but we also want to be mindful of the fact we, very intentionally... I don't know if you picked up on this, but this episode ends with the closing voiceover starts, but then it doesn't really stop," he told ET. "Then you just hear the music and you hear the sound of the ventilator and we're not sure, going into this specific moment in the season, how capable Meredith is of imagining herself being on the beach. It will come back in ways that it has not yet, that we haven't seen yet."
 As for the future of the series, producers are pretty tight lipped as to when the show will end. Already on its 17th season, the show has seen many changes and its fans have adapted with its main character along the way. Marinis says she has no idea when the show could be over.

 "As for nearing the end, I feel like starting the last few seasons, there are always theories. But I feel like we are succeeding still in incredible fashion, and we're so grateful for that. But I will say, because of the circumstances of this year, we had been writing each episode -- because we have no idea, depending on COVID rates and obviously production is still going on, if one day, they're just going to say we have to stop because of safety," Marinis says.
 She continued, "We have been writing each episode like it could possibly be the last episode until we could get back on the air because we just don't know. So we're throwing everything that we can, story-wise. Not every episode ends with a cliffhanger necessarily, but every episode has such an emotional punch to it, for at least a few of our characters, that if it had to be the last episode for a second, it could be. The first six are definitely an example of that. But we're lucky in that we've still been able to continue to shoot, so we will have more episodes. But as for the end, who knows when _Grey's Anatomy_ will end."

"If it was a little bit closer, I would have considered going for it," Gruden said. "I know I went for it a few times earlier in the game. But to take the lead with 3 minutes left, I thought was the play to make at that time."


  That proved costly when the Raiders defense couldn't stop the Chargers in the first game since firing coordinator Paul Guenther and replacing him with Rod Marinelli. The fourth penalty of the game on cornerback Trayvon Mullen and a 53-yard pass to Jalen Guyton set up Justin Herbert's 1-yard sneak that won it for the Chargers.


  That spoiled the big debut for Mariota. He threw for 226 yards and a TD and ran for 88 yards and a TD. He is the first player since at least 1948 to come off the bench and throw for at least 200 yards and a score and run for at least 50 and a score.


  It was the kind of performance that made him the No. 2 overall pick in Tennessee but one he didn't show enough with the Titans, leading him to lose his starting job last season to Ryan Tannehill and eventually land with the Raiders.


  "It's been a long journey," he said. "I've been through kind of everything from injuries to surgeries to mental kind of lapses and the confidence thing. I just truly appreciate the Raiders and the entire organization for kind of helping me through that. I was trying to kind of find my way again and they gave me an opportunity to kind of take some time. They're patient with me. I just appreciate the fact that they were willing to do that."

“I think one thing for me, personally, was the direction the New York Mets were headed in,’’ MCann said in a Zoom call Thursday. “From the moment we heard from the Mets this offseason, they were definitely a team high on the list, just because of the guys they have in the clubhouse, but also the addition of the new owner, Sandy [Alderson, team president] and Jared [Porter, new general manager].

Former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Thursday hit out at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for insulting the farmers' struggle with "cheap theatrics by tearing copies of the farm laws" which he was among the first to notify in the country.
 In a statement here, Badal said the Delhi Chief Minister was known as a "dramabaaz" but this time he had indulged in unparalleled hypocrisy by tearing the same laws in the Vidhan Sabha which he had notified on November 23.
 Asking Kejriwal to have mercy on the farmers, she said it was strange that the Delhi CM had only suddenly discovered that farmers were sitting out in the open in cold wave conditions and that more than twenty farmers had passed away. "The Delhi chief minister is only shedding crocodile tears in a desperate bid to wipe away the blot he has put on his name by rushing to notify the farm laws on the directions of the central government. These dramas however will not help. Farmers know that Kejriwal and AAP have never supported their struggle and that Kejriwal has always danced to the tune of the central government".
 The Bathinda lawmaker said asserted that it was not the first time that Kejriwal had tried to "befool" farmers. "Earlier also the Delhi Chief Minister first notified the hated farm laws secretly and when this fact came out in the open he tried to win the sympathy of farmers by going in for a farcical inspection of a few toilets near the Singhu border. This latest antics of tearing copies of the farm laws has also been done to save AAP's sinking ship in Punjab where the party has been thoroughly discredited and become redundant. Such low-level tactics will not help. Punjabis have seen through AAP and will never trust the party every again", she added.
 While tearing the copies of the three recently enacted farm laws in the special assembly session, Kejriwal on Thursday had accused BJP of bringing these laws to get funds for elections. "BJP has made the elections very costly in the last few years. The farm laws have been made by the BJP for getting funds for elections," he had said.
 Hundreds of farmers are protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 26 against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.
