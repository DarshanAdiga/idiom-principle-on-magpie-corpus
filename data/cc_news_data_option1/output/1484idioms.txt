Crystal Palace have completed the signing of goalkeeper Alex McCarthy from QPR for an undisclosed fee.
 McCarthy moves to Selhurst Park on a four-year deal following just one season with QPR, who were relegated from the Premier League last term, after Palace met a release clause in his contract which was reported to be £3.5million.
 The 25-year-old made only four appearances in his time at Loftus Road, serving as deputy to first-choice keeper Rob Green.
 He becomes Palace's third signing of the transfer window, with Yohan Cabaye and Patrick Bamford, who joined on a season-long loan from Chelsea this week, also linking up with Alan Pardew's side.
 "I'm over the moon. When I first heard about Palace's interest I was excited because I really wanted to be back in the Premier League," McCarthy told Palace's official website.
 "Towards the end of last season I started hearing little inklings about a move and then gradually over the summer things progressed and now, here I am.      "Every time I've played at Palace the atmosphere has been brilliant; the fans are excellent and they're so passionate about their club. I'm really excited to be here."

There's a lot to unpack from the elections--how did signature-gathering play out for the GOP and just how conservative will our next governor be? The GOP candidates are vying for the conservative crown. Former House Speaker Greg Hughes made a blatant plea to conservatives in a recent commercial, Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said all the "right" things to the Eagle Forum, and boy wonder Jon Huntsman Jr. has tapped his former general counsel Sen. Mike Lee to praise him as a "true conservative." Utah Policy's Bob Bernick suggested that the governor find an alternative route for signature gathering. Signatures became an option under law and against the right wing's better judgment. And Huntsman, whom polls place close behind Cox, had to pull out all the stops to gather 28,000 valid signatures amid the pandemic by the April 13 deadline. But can he now maintain the momentum? "No one is passionate about another term for Huntsman," says one Utah Policy commenter, "including Huntsman."

Edin Dzeko's future at Manchester City remains uncertain, with manager Manuel Pellegrini suggesting he will not feature in the club's pre-season games until the matter is resolved.
 The Bosnia-Herzegovina international has been linked with a move away from the Etihad Stadium in the off-season, with Roma widely reported to be interested in his services.
 Dzeko played no part for City in their International Champions Cup clash with Roma on Tuesday, which the Premier League side won on penalties following a 2-2 draw.
 And ahead of a clash against Real Madrid on Friday, Pellegrini was unable to shed much light on the future of his forward.
 "Edin didn't play the last game as it's not clear if he will continue here but he is still working here with the whole squad," he said.
 Pellegrini also confirmed that Fabian Delph would likely make his debut following his move from Aston Villa, while Yaya Toure was once again quizzed on his future at City.
 "There was too much speculation about me leaving – it's clear that I have my contract at City and I want to see out my contract," he said.
 Meanwhile Pellegrini, a former Real manager, is looking forward to facing his former employers in front of a huge crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
 "We are in pre-season and it's a friendly but the fans deserve a good game – I'm sure Real Madrid and us will play a good game," he said.
 "Playing in front of 90,000 is big for the players – although the result is not important, both teams will try to win.
 "It's always special to play against Real Madrid, especially because of the way the fans supported me when I left there."

CHANDIGARH The coronavirus disease (Covid-19), thus far, has spared the people of Haryana's Jhajjar district. Even as the district shares its boundaries with Delhi and Gurugram, where the infection has been rising steadily, Jhajjar has remained safe from the threat of the virus at least during the first spell of the lockdown. So what may have helped in stopping the virus spread. "One of the reasons behind Jhajjar evading the virus is the age-old practice of 'thikri pehra' that the administration started soon after the initial cases of outbreak emerged in its neighbourhood," said a Haryana government spokesperson. The government also appreciates the 'discipline' of people during the lockdown, coupled with effective arrangements made by the district administration. Even before the 'Janata Curfew' on March 22, the 'thikri pehra' was in place in the district. "Thikri pehra and the efforts of local administration acted as a shield which prevented the spread of the pandemic in Jhajjar," the spokesperson said. All grocery stores, vegetable shops, hawkers and milk distributors were identified and registered well in time, he said. Grocery and vegetable vendors of the entire district were classified into 306 groups and collective passes issued to them for their work-related movement. A survey of about 75,000 labourers and 6,500 brick kiln workers was also conducted by the district administration, which facilitated it to keep tabs on them. As many as 1,200 migrant workers, including children and women, have taken shelter in 24 relief camps in Jhajjar, Beri, Bahadurgarh and Badli. "All boundaries of Jhajjar district were sealed to prevent the movement of people and 75 nakas were put in the urban and rural areas," the spokesperson said.

First, respect others with reasonable deadlines or work requirements. Patience right now is a real virtue. For those still working in this environment we need to set fair deadlines, and frankly consider removing or delaying other job requirements and expectations temporarily.
 Second, if we are feeling emotional or under pressure (who isn’t), take a little time to calm down before we interact with others. I have found sometimes that what is on my mind can wait a few hours or maybe until the next day. If you must deal with a problematic issue with another person, carefully assess where they are at. Thinking about how we would want to be treated is a good indicator, not only on what we say but when we say it.
 A new challenge for many of us is getting used to using the telephone again. While emailing and messaging have become prevalent, it is fraught with risks. Most times face-to-face conversations are best in dealing with difficult challenges. But since that is not possible, in many cases right now, I'd suggest brushing up on your phone skills. An excellence reference is wikihow.com/Effectively-Communicate-over-the-Phone.
 Third, we need to develop an interest in those around us. A 2017 study by the Economist showed an encouraging trend that parents are now spending almost twice the amount of time with children as they did 50 years. We need to look at the sheltering in place and homeschooling as an opportunity for even more time and interaction.
 Chances are, 20 or 30 years from now, children will remember the age of COVID-19 as a period they had the opportunity to spend both more quality and quantity time with their parents. The other side of sheltering in place, though, is older people in high-risk groups may be starved for attention. With proper precautions, make a special effort to visit with them in person (when safe) or on the phone.
 Fourth, and one of the most apparent and most neglected implications of the Golden Rule, is to say thank you and acknowledge outstanding work. Survey after survey indicates that most employees value recognition and appreciation as high as or higher than a larger paycheck. It must be sincere and based on actual excellent work. Otherwise, it will be seen as manipulative and can backfire. It really is OK these days to say thanks to those working in stores and elsewhere for their “service” to us.
 Fifth, understand mistakes will be made. While accountability is necessary, understand the reasons for errors or failure. It is how we want to be treated if it was our mistake, especially now — grant grace to others.
 In the final analysis, applying the Golden Rule is not so much about applying a rule as having a mindset of kindness and respect.

West Ham signing Angelo Ogbonna said manager Slaven Bilic was a big reason for him joining the Premier League club.
 The Londoners completed the €11million signing of Ogbonna from Juventus, with the defender penning a four-year deal.
 Ogbonna, 27, said the appointment of Bilic was a big reason for his decision to join West Ham.
 "I am very pleased to have joined West Ham United," he told the club's website.
 "I spoke with the coach and he has given me the opportunity to play in the Premier League. That was always my dream and now I am very happy to be doing this.
 "I knew about Slaven and that he is a good manager. Before he joined West Ham he was coach of Croatia and I know what he can do for his team.
 "I saw his team in action and know that he plays attacking football. He has a great attitude and wants to win.
 "The West Ham fans can expect to me see my professionalism and my tradition. I want to do my best and I want to be better than last season."
 Ogbonna said he was excited to join the club fellow Italian Paolo Di Canio made his name with.
 "I knew West Ham United from watching the Premier League in Italy," he said.
 "West Ham are very famous in Italy because Paolo Di Canio played for them and I know the famous number six shirt. I know how great the fans are and I like this kind of support.
 "I look forward to coming to London. I want to play at West Ham for a number of seasons and to improve my English."

Peru ended their 2015 Copa America campaign on a high, overcoming Paraguay 2-0 in the third-place match in Concepcion on Friday.
 Andre Carrillo and Paolo Guerrero were the heroes for Peru, who also finished third four years ago, with their second-half goals proving the difference at Estadio Municipal Alcaldesa Ester Roa Rebolledo.
 After their semi-final exit to hosts Chile and dour opening half, Carrillo volleyed beyond Justo Villar in the 48th minute.
 And Guerrero netted late on as Peru claimed consecutive third-place finishes at the premier South American tournament.
 There were changes to both teams, with Peru pair Christian Ramos and Yordy Reyna starting in place of Jefferson Farfan, who did not pass a late fitness test, and Carlos Zambrano (suspended) after the 2-1 defeat to Chile.
 Paraguay counted the cost of their 6-1 drubbing at the hands of Argentina, with Derlis Gonzalez (thigh), Roque Santa Cruz (hamstring), Bruno Valdez (thigh), Nelson Valdez (thigh), Edgar Benitez, Richard Ortiz and Ivan Piris dropping out for Lucas Barrios, Raul Bobadilla, Oscar Romero, Osvaldo Martinez, Nestor Ortigoza, Miguel Samudio and Marcos Caceres.
 Chances were at a premium in the first half, with both teams failing to create anything clear-cut during the opening 45 minutes.
 Reyna and Romero were limited to long-range efforts for Peru and Paraguay respectively as the half ended all-square.
 The match came to life in the 48th minute, when Carrillo volleyed past Paraguay goalkeeper Villar from outside the area.
 A corner kick deflected up in the air and Carrillo got his outstretched boot to the ball, leaving Villar with no chance.
 It was the Sporting Lisbon forward's first international goal since August 2012.
 Peru had Carlos Ascues to thank after the hour-mark, with his last-ditch challenge enough to deny Edgar Benitez and Paraguay an equaliser.
 Benitez was picked out by Romero at the back post with the goal at his mercy in the 66th minute, but Ascues was on hand to deny the Paraguay striker a clear goalscoring opportunity as the ball hit the bottom of the post and rolled away to safety.
 Victory was sealed for Peru in the 89th minute as Guerrero side-footed through Villar's legs after a cross from Joel Sanchez.

On the other hand, all these restrictions can be an opportunity to reconnect with others, whether it be by phone, doing things with our families, and being helpful to those in need.
 Right now, we live in a pressure-filled world. For those who are still working in essential businesses, there is not only the pressure of routine work but a genuine threat to their health. In recent years we have properly recognized health care workers, emergency responders, including police and firefighters. But I think it is time to show genuine appreciation for those working in food stores, auto repair shops, and other industries deemed essential.
 We all have problems — some minor and others major — and we need to treat others the way we want to be treated. All of us need to be cognizant of those around us. The variety of experiences Americans are facing has never been so great. Many people are worried about their jobs, some are furloughed, while others are working unbelievable hours.
 How we respond to all of this also has to vary. Sometimes it means encouraging others. At other times it might mean just minding our own business. The Golden Rule poignantly reminds us it is not all about us! Practicing the Golden Rule is easier said than done, but we are called to this higher standard.

Ireland's operators are coping just fine with the additional traffic demand on their networks stemming from the coronavirus pandemic...but nonetheless, two of them applied for - and were granted - temporary licences for new spectrum as soon as the market regulator and the government signed off on new regulations.
 After a swift consultation process, that found favour with some but not all industry stakeholders, ComReg late last week announced its temporary permits were ready to go and revealed that incumbent operator Eir and 3 Ireland had both been awarded licences.
 "Mobile networks have coped well with the extra usage, but they currently have less headroom to accommodate further increases or potential spikes in demand," ComReg said in a statement published on Thursday alongside details of the temporary licences.
 Operators can apply for up to 10 MHz of paired 700 MHz frequencies; to use spectrum in the 2.6 GHz band for specific traffic hotspots, such as temporary medical facilities; and to open up their existing 2.1 GHz frequencies currently assigned for 3G for broader use, including 4G. In each case, licences are valid for three months and cost the nominal sum of €100.
 ComReg revealed that Eir and 3 have both received temporary licences for the 700 MHz band and 2.1 GHz bands, effective 9 April and valid until 8 July. Licences can be extended for a further three-month period, should the current situation remain.
 In keeping with the few positives emerging from the coronavirus pandemic, it took ComReg just a fortnight to magic up the new spectrum for the temporary licences. As it noted though, the current situation is unique and bears little resemblance to the approach it needs to take when awarding long-term rights of use for spectrum.
 And the spectrum was, of course, there all along though. No actual magic required.
 The 700 MHz and 2.6 GHz frequencies are actually slated to form part of an upcoming multi-band spectrum auction in Ireland that the regulator has been working on for the past couple of years. The 2.6 GHz band is at present unused while the 700 MHz frequencies were in use by national broadcaster RTÉ for DTT services until as recently as 4 March.
 RTÉ was one of the stakeholders thanked by the regulator for "engaging so rapidly and constructively" with the temporary licensing process, as were Ireland's three MNOs - Eir, Vodafone and 3, who jointly made the request for temporary spectrum - cable operator Virgin Media, and the Irish Aviation Authority. The last two expressed concerns over the regulator's course of action though, both due to potential interference with their own systems.
 Nonetheless, ComReg insists that all parties have worked hard on technical coordination and the whole process demonstrates that this industry can move quickly when it wants or needs to.

Singing and ministering through song was at the heart and soul of Jeannie her entire life. She tirelessly and faithfully helped cultivate the choir over many dedicated years because it was her calling. Jeannie was blessed to have an ear for notes and the gift to put choir members into harmony for the glory of the Lord. She also was part of community choirs, including Kankakee County and district choirs and performed with other local and non-local groups. Jeannie was selected to be a part of the well-renowned group, the Rev. Bryant Jones and Chosen of Chicago, where she was chosen to be the featured vocalist on several of their projects.
 Jeannie was not only a talent in Illinois, but God allowed her to spread her gift nationally and internationally in countries such as France, Sweden, Vienna Austria, Italy, Germany, Monte Carlo and Istanbul. She was known for her vocal range and her explosive way of bringing listeners into an atmosphere of worship and into the moving presence of God.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A white lawyer who defended black civil rights activists at the height of the movement in Louisiana, often weathering threats to his own life, has died.
 Richard Barry Sobol died March 24 at his home in Sebastopol, California, of aspiration pneumonia, stemming from radiation treatment for squamous cell carcinoma found in a lymph node in his neck, his wife, Anne Sobol, told The Associated Press in an email. He was 82.
 Sobol's career included groundbreaking litigation involving desegregation of schools, employment discrimination against minorities and women, electing blacks to public office and a case that led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision guaranteeing the right to a trial by jury in state criminal cases.
 Gary Duncan, the subject of that lawsuit, said he's still at a loss for words after hearing of Sobol's death.
 “When he passed away, I lost part of myself,” Duncan said in a telephone interview from his home in Harvey, Louisiana. “He was one of the greatest people in the world.”
 Duncan said Sobol treated him like a son and his death is a “great loss” to the world.

 Pauline (Polly) Anne Fajen, 56, of Boonville, died on April 8, 2020. She was surrounded by loving care of family as she spent her final days in hospice, after a 21-year life with cancer.
 Polly was a determined lover of life, warm and fun, and a precious friend to many around the world. She was a caring and influential nurse, at the forefront of treating people with AIDS, then going to psychiatric nursing and finally to physical rehabilitation nursing, working with people with spinal cord injury and stroke.
 Faith was paramount to Polly, and she remained active in her church until the end. Just a few of her loving services included singing in the choir, teaching Bible classes, serving on the Caring Committee with her generous outreach and assisting with Music Camp.
 A memorial service will not be held at this time but will be planned for a future date when people are able to gather together to celebrate Polly Fajen's Most Excellent Adventure of Life.

Peter Odemwingie has penned a new one-year deal at Stoke City.
 The Nigeria forward moved to the Britannia Stadium from Cardiff City in January 2014 as part of a deal that saw Kenwyne Jones head in the opposite direction and Odemwingie endeared himself to supporters with six goals in 15 Premier League appearances in the same season.
 Odemwingie, 33, missed the majority of last term with a serious knee injury, but returned to action in April in a 1-1 draw against Sunderland.
 The former West Brom striker has subsequently been rewarded with a new contract that includes an option for a further 12 months.
 "We're delighted to announce that Peter has extended his stay with us at the club until the summer of 2016," said Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes.
 "He suffered an unfortunate injury last season after making a big impression immediately after joining the club.
 "Peter has worked incredibly hard to battle back from this to regain full fitness. He's a popular figure, not just in the dressing room but with club staff and supporters, so we are thrilled to keep him on board this season."
 Stoke have also confirmed that John Coates, son of chairman Peter, is to become the club's new vice-chairman.

We are sheltering in place, are cut off from so many of our favorite activities, friends, and in some cases, “cooped up” non-stop with family members. As these weeks of uncertainty go by, I believe we may have to put forth more effort than ever to keep the peace, keep sane and maintain our relationship with others.

NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is releasing a new iPhone that will be vastly cheaper than the models it rolled out last fall at a time when the economy was booming and the pandemic had yet to force people to rethink their spending.
 The second-generation iPhone SE introduced Wednesday will sell for as little as $399, a 40% markdown from the most affordable iPhone 11 unveiled last year. Higher-end versions of the iPhone 11 sell for more than $1,000. Online orders for the iPhone SE will begin Friday, with the first deliveries expected April 24.
 Even before the pandemic, many people had begun to balk at the substantial price tags for smartphones that weren't that much better than the ones they already owned. That pushed Apple to step up its emphasis on music and video services to the more than 1 billion people who carry around at least one of their internet-connected devices.
 High-priced gadgets are expected to become an even tougher sell as the economy plunges into its deepest downturn in more than a decade.
 Apple maps out its products many months in advance and the new iPhone SE isn't a direct response to the economic meltdown hatched by the pandemic. Even though the iPhone SE will sell at a price that seems right for the tough times ahead, it is an extraordinarily difficult time to introduce a product, said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.
 “Apple faced a tough decision to make and ultimately decided to release and green light this smart phone to the market in hopes of gaining contained success out of the gates," Ives wrote.

That European towers deals are still coming thick and fast should surprise noone - even under the current pandemic - given the attractiveness of those passive infrastructure assets ahead of mass-market 5G rollouts. Neither is it much of a shock that once again independent infrastructure specialist Cellnex is the one spending, this time on the expansion of its recently-acquired Portuguese business.
 The towers firm has acquired Nos Towering, infrastructure arm of the Portuguese telco of the same name, via a cash deal that values the business at €375 million. It has also committed to €175 million in capex over the next six years, which will include the build out of up to 400 new sites.
 As it stands, Nos Towering comprises around 2,000 sites, including both telecoms towers and rooftop antennas. 40% of its sites are located in urban areas with the remainder in suburban and rural places. As usual, Nos has brokered a tenancy deal with Cellnex that will see it occupy the sites it has sold for 15 years, with the possibility to extend further.
 The move comes three months after Cellnex made its first foray into Portugal, announcing the €800 purchase of OMTEL, part-owned by Altice Europe, in January. That deal will give Cellnex 3,000 sites, with a further 400 to be added to the footprint.
 "Following the very recent agreement to acquire OMTEL, also in Portugal, this transaction exemplifies the sense of being an operator which, precisely due to its neutral and independent nature, can consolidate long-term collaboration projects with the various MNOs and telecom operators who access our infrastructures to roll out their telecommunications networks," said Cellnex CEO Tobias Martinez, in a canned statement.
 He didn't specifically mention 5G, but that's clearly the implication here.
 The network densification that will come with the new generation of mobile technology presents a sizeable opportunity for infrastructure companies, which in turn creates a valuable outlet for telcos looking to monetise their towers and related assets. Indeed, in a separate Portuguese language statement, Nos chief executive Miguel Almeida talked up the telco's strategy of investing in data and mobile voice services with a view to helping business customers address "the increasingly demanding digital transformation challenge" while meeting the needs of consumers. Like many of its peers before it, Nos os looking to focus on services and to free up funds to enable it to do that.
 Cellnex, meanwhile, is getting in on the ground floor in Portugal, in 5G terms, at least.
 Aside from test networks, there is as yet no 5G in the country. Regulator Anacom is working on the auction of spectrum in the 700 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 3.6 GHz bands, while the state is still considering its options for 26 GHz spectrum. And with the prospect of a new operator entering the market - the regulator has proposed reserving spectrum for a new entrant - Portugal is an attractive location for a towers company at present.
 The current pandemic has, to an extent, put "the present" on hold, and that applies to 5G too. Last month Anacom put its consultation into the multi-band auction - due to take place this month - on ice and simultaneously paused the migration of the DTT network to free up the 700 MHz band for mobile.
 However, 5G will come to Portugal and Cellnex will be well-placed to capitalise on it.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic is paying little importance to Paris Saint-Germain's International Champions Cup success as the French champions gear up for Saturday's Trophee des Champions clash with Lyon.
 PSG face last season's Ligue 1 runners-up Lyon in Montreal this weekend as the 2015-16 rears into view, with Laurent Blanc having successfully guided PSG to success in 2013 and 2014.
 Blanc's men overcame Fiorentina and Manchester United in the ICC, with Ibrahimovic grabbing the second in a 2-0 win over the Premier League side on Wednesday in Chicago.
 Despite overcoming stiff opposition in the United States, Ibrahimovic has warned it will be worth nothing if they do not beat Hubert Fournier's side on Saturday.
 "This [the ICC] is not an official tournament, it just serves to prepare for the season," he said. "The first real date of the season is Saturday's Super Cup, that's what counts.
 "I want to win this title for a good start to the season. We have worked hard to be ready."
 The Ligue 1 champions arrive in Canada – hosting the Trophee clash for the second time in seven years – with a full squad to choose from after Javier Pastore and Ezequiel Lavezzi both returned to full training.
 However, their opponents should not be underestimated given Lyon have lifted the trophy more than any other side.
 Seven of their eight titles have come in the last 13 years, the most recent in 2012 when they beat Montpellier on penalties.
 The loss of Clement Grenier to a thigh injury means Hubert Fournier's side, who have only lost once to PSG in their last four meetings – their two encounters last season both ending 1-1.
 Like PSG, Lyon were part of a pre-season tournament ahead of the Trophee, but their experience could have not been more different.
 Contesting the Emirates Cup in London, Lyon lost 6-0 and 2-0 to Arsenal and Villarreal respectively, finishing the two-day tournament firmly bottom of the standings.

Utah is an outlier without a stay- at-home order and all but one Republican candidate for governor thinks that's just fine, according to _The Salt Lake Tribune._ Utah Policy polls tell us that Utahns are more worried about the economic impact than their health and that they think the media is hyping the danger. Certainly, Utah is no New York, and we're lucky we're no Florida with its crowded beaches. Now is not a time to be complacent, but it would be a great time for hard facts. We know math and know what exponential growth is like. But the governor is loathe to face the wrath of free-thinkers like Idaho rancher Ammon Bundy, who might think of moving here to run for governor.

Haiti pinched a draw from the jaws of defeat, denying Panama 1-1 in their CONCACAF Gold Cup opener on Tuesday.
 Alberto Quintero was on hand to power home in the 56th minute, after Haiti defender Reginal Goreux's failed clearance of a high-bouncing ball on the edge of the area left the islanders vulnerable.
 But Haiti equalised in the 86th minute, Duckens Nazon scoring just six minutes after gracing the pitch after linking up with Wilde Donald Guerrier and earning a point.
 Earlier, Quintero pounced as the ball evaded Goreux's swinging boot, and finished clinically past a stranded Johny Placide.
 It was the least the Panamanians deserved at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, as they had more than 73 per cent possession in the first half - and with that amount of ball came numerous chances.
 The Haiti defence had been up to the task, however, quelling the 2013 finalists - but Quintero managed to capitalise when Hernan Gomez's men needed it before substitute Nazon's late run and finish earned Marc Collat's team a draw.
 Panama striker Luis Tejada was at his acrobatic best in the first half, twice connecting with an overhead scissor - although neither time did it trouble Haiti goalkeeper Johny Placide.
 Tejada also had free-kick duties in the ninth minute, but he curled his left- foot effort wide of the near post after referee Henry Bejarano had produced the first yellow card of the match - cautioning Jean Alexandre for his challenge on Panama midfielder Quintero.
 Haiti's best chance of the half came moments later - James Marcelin lashing an effort from range that had 2013 Gold Cup goalkeeper of the tournament Jaime Penedo beaten, only for the ball to fly just over the crossbar.
 In the 20th minute, Tejada used his chest to flick a ball up to himself - and his scissor kick was on target but Placide collected easily.
 A Haiti counter-attack in the 25th minute had some danger for Panama, so much so Adolfo Machado saw yellow for bringing down Wilde Donald Guerrier.
 Eight minutes from the interval, Panama produced their best sight on goal - with Blas Perez denied by a block from the Haiti defence, before Valentin Pimentel's follow-up shot found the side-netting.
 Quintero curled a powerful effort on target in the shadows of half-time, but Placide was up to the challenge with a strong parry, before Tejada tried his luck with his back to goal again - but his scissor went wide of the target.
 Quintero's goal changed the complexion of the game as Haiti went in pursuit of an equaliser, but Gomez remained positive - substituting Tejada for in-form attacker Abdiel Arroyo, who had scored in each of his past three club fixtures.
 Haiti also swung two changes with 20 minutes to play - Pascal Millien and Jean-Eudes Maurice the inclusions - but it was Perez who forced a save from Placide moments later as Panama looked to seal the points in their Group A opener.
 Arroyo nearly made it 2-0 with 10 minutes remaining, forcing a low parry from Placide.
 Interestingly, Gomez did not use 2013 Gold Cup tournament leading scorer Gabriel Torres, the Colorado Rapids man resigned to a spot on the bench throughout - and Panam could not hold a one-goal lead without him.

The average price increase for sugary-sweetened beverages was 1.94 cents per ounce in Seattle and 26 cents per ounce in the comparison area, according to the surveys. Increases at Seattle stores near the city's borders were lower than at stores elsewhere in the city.
 So why did lower-income kids outside Seattle reduce their consumption even more than kids in Seattle?
 "These findings could be the result of general norms and trends in sugary beverage consumption, limitations in our measurement of beverage consumption or other unknown factors affecting beverage consumption among lower-income families in our region," Wednesday's report says.
 Earlier this year, a peer-reviewed study by University of Illinois at Chicago researchers said sales of sugary-sweetened beverages at stores in Seattle had dropped about 30.5%, while sales in Portland, which has no soda tax, had declined 10.5%.

Margaret Gerbasi   Margaret Creech Gerbasi passed away at home peacefully on April 13, 2020. She was 93. Margaret was born in Bennettsville, South Carolina on Christmas Eve in 1926 to Joseph William Creech and Lida Steen Creech. She was a graduate of Bennettsville High School's class of 1944. Margaret is survived by her children, Ronald Gerbasi Jr. and his wife Nicola of Edgewater, Maryland, Catherine Macchio and her husband Frank of Stamford, Connecticut, and Cindy Ford of Fort Myers, Florida, eight grandchildren and eleven great- grandchildren. She was predeceased by her husband, Ronald Gerbasi Sr., her sisters, Mary Creech Chavis (Dewey), Ruby Creech Usher (Austin), Josephine Creech Maybank (Joseph), and Beulah Creech Meree (Charles), and her brothers, John Kenny Creech (Blanche), Ralph Ruler Creech (Molly), James Harold Creech, and Curtis Creech, Sr. (Ella).   Margaret met her husband, Ronald, a Greenwich resident, during World War II. He was a sailor stationed at the Naval Base in Charleston, South Carolina where she worked as a riveter at the Navy Yard. She was 19 and he was 18. Ronald sent his new bride love letters while he was at sea, which she saved to this day. After the war, the couple spent the next 63 years of their marriage living between South Carolina and Connecticut to be near both Margaret's large southern family and Ronald's relatives in the north.   Margaret was a stay-at-home wife, mother, aunt, and grandmother. She provided loving attention to all of her children and grandchildren as well as her nieces and nephews. Margaret was the support person that the family sought out when help, advice, or comfort was needed. She took her coffee black and her tea with milk and sugar. She loved taking long walks along River Road in Cos Cob, and along Lake Wallace in Bennettsville. She had a special talent for tackling crossword puzzles each day. Even after she lost her eyesight to macular degeneration, she was able to visualize the puzzle as her husband read the clues to her. Her resilient spirit was cultivated by being a lifelong Mets fan and Democrat.   The family would like to thank Therese and Celia St. Juste for their loving care during her final year. Their support helped not only Margaret, but also the whole family. They were greatly appreciated.   Funeral services will be handled at a later date by Burroughs, Cooper, and Kiser Funeral Home, 688 Beauty Spot Road, Bennettsville, SC 29512, with the assistance of Lacerenza Funeral Home, 8 Schuyler Avenue, Stamford, CT. As we await the chance to celebrate her life, please consider honoring Margaret's memory by reaching out to a loved one today as she so often did with her family and friends.

The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday granted bail to a Patiala woman accused in a drug seizure case after she pleaded for her newborn's safety amid the Covid-19 outbreak.
 The woman was given bail even as the Patiala civil surgeon had suggested that she be kept in a creche with her newborn and two other women inmates. However, the court observed that the women inmates were not health experts and could not guarantee the petitioner's safety amid the pandemic outbreak. It was on April 9 that the HC had sought an opinion from the civil surgeon on a place that would be safer for the newborn -- the jail or her village.
 The bench of justice Arvind Singh Sangwan granted the woman three-month bail, while directing Patiala central jail superintendent to release her forthwith after obtaining an undertaking from one of her blood relatives that she would appear before the trial court within a period of 14 days to furnish bail bonds.
 The petitioner, who has been in judicial custody for more than eight months, gave birth on April 1 in a Patiala hospital. She was pregnant when the police had booked her on July 10, 2019, in Rajpura. Charges were framed against her on December 20, 2019.
 It was alleged that a police party had spotted her carrying a polythene bag which she threw into a canal upon seeing them. Later, the police had allegedly found 80 injections of buprenorphine and 80 injections of avil phineramine maleate in the bag.
 In her plea, she had argued that she had no previous history of involvement in any drug-related operations and had accused the cops of shoddy probe in the matter.

Andrea Pirlo was afforded a rapturous welcome from the New York City faithful as he came off the bench to make his MLS bow in their 5-3 win over Orlando City.
 The legendary Italian was introduced 12 minutes into the second half of Sunday's match at Yankee Stadium with his side leading 2-1 thanks to goals from David Villa and Javier Calle, which sandwiched Cyle Larin's equaliser.
 Pirlo exchanged pleasantries with former Milan team-mate and now-Orlando star Kaka and was cheered every time he touched the ball, as he treated the home fans to a typically classy passing display as he strolled effortlessly around the midfield.
 Larin threatened to spoil the party when he levelled with his second goal of the game shortly after Pirlo's arrival, but Villa's 12th of the season restored New York's advantage in the 67th minute.
 Pirlo then had a hand in New York's fourth goal, as he threaded a ball to Kwadwo Poku, who found Thomas McNamara before the 24-year-old lashed a left- footed shot high past Orlando goalkeeper Tally Hall.
 Larin completed his hat-trick with a brilliant toe-poked finish five minutes from time, before Kaka hit the post with a free-kick in injury time and Mikkel Diskerud's breakaway goal made sure Pirlo enjoyed a winning MLS debut.

 Amazon Web Services, a market leader in providing cloud computing services, had long been considered a leading candidate to run the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, known as JEDI. The project will store and process vast amounts of classified data, allowing the U.S. military to improve communications with soldiers on the battlefield and use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities.

New iPhones are typically released with much fanfare at a Silicon Valley theater named after Apple founder Steve Jobs, who revolutionized the market when he introduced the first iPhone in 2007. The springtime event never happened this year because of the pandemic.
 Even before the rapidly spreading coronavirus forced most states to order lockdowns, Apple had been hit hard by efforts to contain it in China. Besides being its third largest market behind the U.S. and Europe, China is also where Apple makes most of its iPhones.
 With both its factories and stores in China shut down for several weeks this year, Apple issued a warning two months ago that quarterly sales will fall short of previous projections. The Cupertino, California, company is scheduled to release its result for the quarter later this month.
 The new iPhone SE is an update to another low-cost model that Apple released four years ago. Apple stopped selling the original iPhone SE in 2018.
 The updated Phone SE is essentially the same as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which came out in 2017. The iPhone SE won't share the same displays and cameras carried by the newer iPhone 11 models. But it will be powered by the same A13 processing chip that's inside the more expensive iPhone 11.
 The original iPhone SE was was a hit with budget-conscious consumers or those who preferred a smaller, 4-inch screen as newer phones grow increasingly large. The new model is slightly larger than the original, with a 4.7-inch screen.
 In what could be another popular twist, the new iPhone SE brings back the home button. That's a notable change from the iPhone 11 line, which ditched the once-familiar button to accommodate larger screens that can handle the highest-quality video and photos.

Dominick J. D'Stefan      Florham Park - Dominick J. D'Stefan , aged 92, a resident of Florham Park for 65 years, passed away peacefully on April 13, 2020 due to complications of the Covid-19 virus.      Dominick lived a long and interesting life. He was born in the Chambersburg section of Trenton to Luigi and Mary D'Stefan in the house that his father, a mason, built by hand. He graduated from Trenton schools and enlisted in the US Navy at the beginning of World War II. He served as a radar technician on board the USS Worcester, a light cruiser, where he developed a lifelong interest in electronics. Radar was new at the time and he relished the challenge. He attended Temple University under the GI Bill and also Rutgers where he obtained a degree in Electrical Engineering.      While attending Temple, Don would take the train from Trenton to Philadelphia, then hop on a bus and if he had time, walk to class. With the quarter he had in his pocket he said he could pay for train fare from Trenton and buy two Italian hot dogs and eat them while walking to class.      He began a career in engineering and was recalled to the US Navy for the Korean War. He always said he would never forget Harry Truman for that one. Thereafter he obtained a Masters degree in Management Science from Stevens Institute of Technology. He began a career with Bell Labs where he met his wife Shirley. He worked on the Telstar Project, the first successful transmission of a radio wave to a target in space and back.      Dominick had a lifelong appreciation of music and was an accomplished trumpeter and trombonist. He was a member of the musicians union for many years playing in orchestras as well as major parades.

"He was so smart and so committed to justice,” said Edelman, a professor at Georgetown Law School.
 Sobol's work in Louisiana, he said, was really remarkable.
 “In Louisiana, at the time of the civil rights movement, lawyering was really thin and Richard was a major player. Everyone went to him; he took on complicated cases, anything that was to be done and he became kind of a hero and he absolutely deserved that,” he said.
 Another friend, retired Columbia Law School professor George Cooper, worked with Sobol at the LCDC.
 “We wanted to do more with our lives,” he recalled. “Richard was one of those men for whom civil rights and justice, particularly justice for black people, was the cause to which he devoted his life. And he faced a lot of danger because of that.”
 Cooper worked with Sobol on one of the first class action lawsuits involving employment discrimination involving a paper mill in Bogalusa, Louisiana and said after that Sobol became the “go-to man” for anyone who had a racial discrimination case.
 A book about the Duncan case is scheduled for release this summer and a documentary about the case is in the works, Anne Sobol said.

It should be noted that the trial was originally scheduled to begin on May 5th, but was pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. This delayed start theoretically gives both sides more time to reach a pre-trial agreement, especially given U.S. Soccer’s recent change in leadership. Then again, there was also tremendous pressure on U.S. Soccer to settle following last summer’s World Cup, and yet, nothing happened. Even if the two sides do choose to enter mediation once more, the arguments laid out below still provide the terms of the debate they’ll be having behind closed doors, rather than in front of a jury.

Inspiration comes in many ways, according to the designers, from other stuff in the GM portfolio to future/concept infotainment to the C8 Corvette and classic Jaguars. Cadillac's concepts like the Escala also weigh heavily. Exterior design manager Pinazzo reaches outside the auto world for ideas including Iris van Herpen's fashion, Maja Petrić's architecture and Amy Karle's art, and is most excited to see the new Hummer EV hit the road.
 The key is to hit customers with what they need, when they need it. "Where is your opportunity to capitalize? You have to know why someone would select your product," says Windham. "We do not take for granted that we have led in this luxury SUV segment for over a decade.
 "This is the new benchmark for Cadillac," says Killen. "We were tasked with developing a simple but well-executed design, bringing Cadillac to the next level. I spend a lot of time visualizing the customer, lots of research. These customers are brand savvy, educated and successful people."

SEATTLE — Hayley Seymour's son was only six days old when he had open-heart surgery at Seattle Children's hospital on Oct. 1. A month later, he was fighting for his life as mold infected his heart.
 The venerated hospital has been struggling to contain Aspergillus mold for nearly two decades. On Monday, the Seymours became the latest family to file a lawsuit over it.
 The baby's procedure didn't have to happen right away, Seymour said, and it didn't have to happen at Children's. If the family had known about the history of mold at the hospital, they wouldn't have had his initial surgery there, she said. But, according to their negligence suit, no one from Children's told them about that history.

Former Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski believes the club can challenge for the Premier League title this season.
 The Germany international ended his three-year stay with the London club at the weekend by making the move to Turkish giants Galatasaray on a three-year deal.
 Despite his time at the Emirates Stadium starting well, Podolski quickly dropped out of favour under Arsene Wenger.
 Regardless, the 30-year-old holds no ill feeling towards the club and backed Arsenal to challenge for their first Premier League title since 2004.
 "Over the last three years I've had the pleasure of working with some amazing people at Arsenal," Podolski posted on Twitter.
 "I want to thank everyone from all the staff behind the scenes to the manager & my team mates, who have all helped make London a second home to me.
 "To the fans… The Best fans in England, who have supported myself and the team no matter what, you will forever hold a special place in my heart and I will forever be a Gunner!
 "I am confident that next season the team will be challenging for that league title and I will be watching on as a fan! COYG."

The UC system is exploring the possibility of graduating medical students early if they meet their graduation requirements, he said. "If they are willing to go to places in crisis such as New York or New Orleans, where the situation is being closely watched, and there are residency programs that are ready to bring them on board, it could happen," Braddock said. "At UCLA, not many of our students will be graduating early. We will, however, offer that option to students."

CHANDIGARH The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday granted bail to a Patiala woman accused in a drug seizure case after she pleaded for her newborn's safety amid the Covid-19 outbreak.The woman was given bail even as the Patiala civil surgeon had suggested that she be kept in a creche with her newborn and two other women inmates. However, the court observed that the women inmates were not health experts and could not guarantee the petitioner's safety amid the pandemic outbreak. It was on April 9 that the HC had sought an opinion from the civil surgeon on a place that would be safer for the newborn -- the jail or her village.The bench of justice Arvind Singh Sangwan granted the woman three-month bail, while directing Patiala central jail superintendent to release her forthwith after obtaining an undertaking from one of her blood relatives that she would appear before the trial court within a period of 14 days to furnish bail bonds.The petitioner, who has been in judicial custody for more than eight months, gave birth on April 1 in a Patiala hospital. She was pregnant when the police had booked her on July 10, 2019, in Rajpura. Charges were framed against her on December 20, 2019.It was alleged that a police party had spotted her carrying a polythene bag which she threw into a canal upon seeing them. Later, the police had allegedly found 80 injections of buprenorphine and 80 injections of avil phineramine maleate in the bag.In her plea, she had argued that she had no previous history of involvement in any drug-related operations and had accused the cops of shoddy probe in the matter.

For Walla Walla’s market, Heiser met with city officials and Walla Walla County Community Health Department over the past few weeks, attempting to see what could be done about maintaining social distancing guidelines.
 Farmers markets are considered essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Gov. Jay Inslee’s “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” initiative. According to Holm, not all vendors may be considered essential.
 Heiser said after meeting with city and health officials, postponement of the opening seemed the best option.
 “We agree with each other and want to err on the side of safety for the community first,” Heiser wrote in an email to the U-B. “We will continue to work on a safety and health plan with the city in order to open the market.”
 In the meantime, Heiser said he is going to help out vendors by marketing their products and websites until the seasonal market is operating.
 The Milton-Freewater Farmers Market has not posted any updates online and attempts to reach market coordinators before press time were unsuccessful.
