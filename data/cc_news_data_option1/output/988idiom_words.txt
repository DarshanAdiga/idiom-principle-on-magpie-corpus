That we can be in the top places of such a form table and yet still be mathematically embroiled in the midst of a desperate relegation battle bears testament to the sorry mess we were under Nathan Jones and the astonishing recovery we’ve made under Michael O’Neill.
 All we need to do now under our Northern Irish manager is to keep up some semblance of the form he’s already overseen and not only will we avoid relegation this season, but I firmly believe we’ll lay a solid foundation for a much more pronounced improvement next season.
 Of course, it wouldn’t be Stoke City if some joy and cause for optimism wasn’t accompanied by a reason to be depressed or concerned and it’s desperately sad to see that Saturday cost us the services of Joe Allen for, at least, the rest of this season.
 I know that Allen is a player who divides opinion and is the cause for much debate among Stoke supporters, but the truth of the matter is that he has been the beating heart of our recovery and is going to be severely missed for the rest of this season.
