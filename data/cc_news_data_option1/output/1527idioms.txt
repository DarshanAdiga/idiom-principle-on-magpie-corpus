Given that the definition of "market value" is what a given property will sell for on the open market, we will need the real estate market to open up again before we can get any real sense of our new normal with respect to house prices and property values.
 In the meantime, there have been some government decisions made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that are already having an impact on the here and now.
 After years of historically low vacancy rates on the rental market, largely attributed to investor-owners experiencing bank-robber returns through short- term rentals, the lockdown had an immediate impact.
 Suddenly investors have unrentable units to carry.
 Almost immediately Craigslist and Kijiji were flooded with new rental apartments.
 For renters who have been forced to endure once-inconceivable bidding wars on apartments approaching peak unaffordability, this is great news.
 More supply means less demand -- you can expect prices to adjust accordingly.
 Even without a crystal ball, we can certainly expect to see an immediate impact on the condo market.
 Those same investor-owners are suddenly entering their second month of lockdown with no clear end in sight.
 Mortgage relief options are limited for non-principal residences, and the short-term rentals that used to cover costs and then some are now banned outright in the province.
 Many investors will find they have no alternative but to offload, so it would be entirely reasonable to expect a rise in "distress sales."
 Even pre-construction condominiums will surely take a hit as buyers under contract, now experiencing lost earnings and unemployment, may no longer qualify for financing and could be unable to close on their deals.
 Is this bad news?
 For some it's not great.
 But is it opening up a wedge of opportunity for buyers and renters who have long needed a break? Absolutely.
 So, while we have all surely lost patience with false optimism in the midst of this pandemic, everything isn't completely awful.

They were the first band from their hometown to make it on the international stage. Their 1992 debut album, Everybody’s Doing It, So Why Can’t We? was a slow burner before catching fire in America. Over the next five years The Cranberries scored number one hits in 26 countries, while their first three albums notched up sales in excess of 28 million.

This may be what the MLB decides to go with if the green light is received to play this year, but only one venue is deemed possible.

Simon and Carla Fowler are anchored in their catamaran about 650 feet off a deserted beach in the Bahamas, and they have a message for anyone locked down on land who wishes that they too could be self-isolating on the water.


  “Being out here in a pandemic is actually a lot harder and more stressful than you might think,” said Simon Fowler, a 60-year-old British events organizer who has spent the last two years living at sea with his Portuguese- born wife on their 40-foot catamaran.


  “It is the most depressing time we have had in two years,” he said. “It has been quite nasty.”


  Locals fearing infection have become less welcoming to cruisers like the Fowlers over the last six weeks. Ports and borders have begun closing, supplies have become harder to find, and the couple have to abide by the same social distancing restrictions in place on land, meaning they can no longer socialize with other sailors.


  The seas may be the ultimate escape and self-isolating destination, but people aboard everything from solo craft to superyachts say the tranquility of the waves has come with logistical hurdles and ethical dilemmas. And then there is the bullhorn of social media: the blaring comments and tweets calling them entitled, clueless about the serious struggles of the day.


  On March 28, David Geffen, the Hollywood billionaire, posted to Instagram a photo of the Caribbean sunset from his $590 million yacht, Rising Sun, with the message “Isolated in the Grenadines avoiding the virus.” The response from many was furious enough to make other superyacht owners, already a secretive bunch, even less disclosing of their whereabouts.

When, in March, New York hospitals started banning all partners, spouses, doulas and generally any visitor at all from the side of a woman in labor, “all hell broke loose,” according to midwife and home-birth expert Susanrachel “Birdie” Condon, an OB-GYN nurse practitioner and co-owner of River and Mountain Midwives in New Paltz.


  Calls started pouring in, said Condon. “Even from out of state,” she added. “Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New York counties I’d never even heard of.” Women were desperate to switch from hospital births to home births.


  Pregnancy and birth during a pandemic was stressful, and the idea of laboring and delivering alone was the last straw. “For a while there,” said Alicia Scott, a 21-weeks pregnant Saugerties resident, “when the hospitals were asking women to go in alone, without anybody … it was a terrifying idea.”

Showers ending as the morning moves into lunch. Overall we will see a sunny Saturday with temperatures in the low 80's. Winds out of the WNW will bring breezy conditions throughout Saturday. Overnight those winds will shift from the north all the way to the southeast and we will see an increase in cloud cover and our dew points will begin increase as well. Around 10am Sunday our western counties will see the first round of showers and thunderstorms. This first line should be through after lunch, once we get into the afternoon more isolated storms begin to move through due east. Later in the evening it looks like conditions begin to favor more severe weather and around 8pm a few more storms begin to enter the CSRA. We will see a continuous supply of thunderstorms throughout the overnight period going into Monday morning. The severe potential will continue to grow overnight into Monday morning. All the severe weather threats are in play. Tornadoes, damaging wind gusts over 70mph, hail possible and a greater risk for flooding this time around. Rain estimates are between 1″-3″ by the end of Monday morning with a few, possibly higher amounts in more localized areas. This risk of flooding will cause grounds to become more saturated. With the increased risk of damaging winds, loose soil will likely cause more trees to topple if we see continuous rain throughout Sunday night. Embedded in this line of storms could be some rotation as we saw last Sunday night which will keep our risk for tornadoes. We will keep you updated with cut-ins, updates and our Facebook Live will be up once any severe weather warnings begin to impeded on the CSRA so we can keep you up to speed on the severe weather threats.

Although it is more "shocking" in contrast to the fact that the news is "below the belt with special headlines", in the following days its influence melts against the background of the routine worries of life. Ali Karimli's constant use of information leaked to Ganimat Zahid, who owns all media outlets, to add credibility and credibility to his slanders, and his bringing witnesses from high-ranking officials are heartbreaking scenes that make the average Azerbaijani a victim of tricks. It is impossible not to see that the real policy they are pursuing is based only on such a parallel: why the Middle East or the Arab Spring has resulted in so many casualties, economic misery and the collapse of statehood that does not result in the transfer of power in oil Baku. If they thought deeply, they would find out for themselves what they had broken their heads.

What do I think? Madrid fans, they are blind! Blind I tell you!Ã¢ÂÂ was the damning verdict from the blogÃ¢ÂÂs AtlÃÂ©tico-supporting cafÃÂ© owner early on Wednesday morning. He was not best pleased at the prospect of Real Madrid winning their 10th European title, the dream of dreams of dreams in the Spanish capital.
 While the grumpy old codger might have been a little biased in his opinion it was a verdict shared by JosÃÂ© Mourinho himself who, to his personal delight, bamboozled all by admitting NaniÃ¢ÂÂs red was only a yellow, that he was Ã¢ÂÂexpecting more from his sideÃ¢ÂÂ and that Ã¢ÂÂthe best team didnÃ¢ÂÂt go throughÃ¢ÂÂ.
 In the UK such flattery has been interpreted as a blatant kiss-up to Manchester United, a club he fancies managing in the future. But La Liga Loca suspects itÃ¢ÂÂs just another way to annoy Florentino PÃÂ©rez and knock gloss off a hugely important result that prevented many a nervous breakdown in the Madridista world.
 Yes, SaturdayÃ¢ÂÂs victory against Barcelona should have been a draw after a late penalty claim was ignored by the referee. Yes, NaniÃ¢ÂÂs red card certainly changed a match where Madrid were labouring when handed possession by Manchester United. And yes, the Madrid press are quite happy to ignore all these decisions going in the clubÃ¢ÂÂs favour, something that will be overlooked completely at a later date if thereÃ¢ÂÂs an unfortunate call that has the papers calling conspiracy.
     _"So this means Fergie's on his way out, right?"_
 Over in the Catalan capital, the result has been predictably labelled a jammy Real Madrid progression to the quarter-finals. _Sport_ Ã¢ÂÂs Joan Batlle snooted that Ã¢ÂÂMadrid ended up suffering against 10, relying on a saving angel, Diego LÃÂ³pez, to avoid a historic humiliation.Ã¢ÂÂ _Mundo Deportivo_ are equally as irked with J.M Artells furious that Ã¢ÂÂthe referee threw life jackets to a Madrid that was on the way to being shipwrecked.Ã¢ÂÂ
 No such pinkie talk in the Spanish capital, though. _Marca_ Ã¢ÂÂs in-house referee may have confessed that the Nani red card was a mistake, but their front page declared that Madrid had Ã¢ÂÂthe heart of a championÃ¢ÂÂ. Even Cristiano Ronaldo admitted too many tingly feelings. Ã¢ÂÂFor the first time in my career the atmosphere got the better of me,Ã¢ÂÂ chirped the returning match winner.
  _AS_ are a little more cagey and merely declare what a great week itÃ¢ÂÂs been. Ã¢ÂÂThe clouds have parted and now the sun shines for Real Madrid, as today they donÃ¢ÂÂt need to be envious of anyone,Ã¢ÂÂ writes Alfredo RelaÃÂ±o.
 TomÃÂ¡s Roncero injects a little bit more enthusiasm into the affair, declaring Ã¢ÂÂeternal glory for the best team in the historyÃ¢ÂÂ and that it was Madrid who lost out to the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs performance. Ã¢ÂÂHe allowed the 1-0 despite the offside from Van Persie and forgave the red and penalty for Rafael. To compare all this with the Nani sending-off feels and wrong and unfair to me.Ã¢ÂÂ
 With a huge sigh of relief, _LLL_ now turns its fairly narrow attention to ValenciaÃ¢ÂÂs attempts to overturn a 2-1 deficit against Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital.
 Although Zlatan Ibrahimovic is missing through suspension, the SwedeÃ¢ÂÂs absence is countered by ValenciaÃ¢ÂÂs lack of first choice centre-back pairing, Ricardo Costa and Adil Rami.
 Roberto Soldado says Los Che will be going into the match with Ã¢ÂÂnothing to loseÃ¢ÂÂ (apart from the tie, perhaps), while manager Ernesto Valverde is confident he has a plan that could see his side prevail. Ã¢ÂÂThe same strategy (as the Mestalla first leg), but not conceding goals.Ã¢ÂÂ Crazy, but it might just work.

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs some selective memory when it comes to the Spanish national team and their grand triumphs of recent years. In fact, itÃ¢ÂÂs a mind wipe of science fiction proportions.
 While itÃ¢ÂÂs true La SelecciÃÂ³n are reigning World and European Champions, the paths to winning these prizes haven't exactly been ones the players have skipped merrily along, humming _Barbie Girl_ while clutching baskets stuffed with rose petals.
 There have been more than a couple of moments when Spain have royally stuffed things up and looked like mere mortals. However, over the five years since the first of their back-to-back-to-back tournament victories, Spain have managed to prevail whenever theyÃ¢ÂÂve wandered into a footballing poop patch. History suggests Spain shall do so again in Tuesday night's 'crunch' World Cup qualifier against France in Paris.
 In 2008, Spain drew 0-0 with Italy in the quarter-finals of the European Championships and were a penalty shoot-out away from being bottling dark horses, all over again. Vicente Del BosqueÃ¢ÂÂs side lost their opening match of the 2010 World Cup to Switzerland in an encounter similar to Friday's underwhelming draw against Finland. Spain then won the title with narrow 1-0 victories in the knock-out stages against Portugal, Paraguay, Germany and Netherlands. The eventual triumph was well deserved, but it wasn't a case of a team sweeping away all before them. It was more grinding than galavanting.
 Spain received another barrage of criticism for only drawing 1-1 with Italy in the group stages of Euro 2012, then again for needing a penalty shoot-out to squeeze past Portugal at the semi-final stage. They then creamed Italy in the final, one of the rare occasions that everything came together for the world's top-ranked side.
 So when Sergio Ramos said on Monday that Ã¢ÂÂfootball has no memoryÃ¢ÂÂ, the Madrid defender was right, although he was referring to the way players must prove themselves again and again in the game, and that "the badge doesnÃ¢ÂÂt win games". Ramos was also correct in his notion that, while Spain are repeated champions of everything, the voyage has never, ever been plain sailing and there have been plenty of slip-ups and wobbles along the way.
 The Finland match was one of them. Although it may seem a little trite to say nobody would have raised an eyebrow at the Spanish showing had they won the game, this could certainly be said of Friday's match at SportingÃ¢ÂÂs El MolinÃÂ³n stadium. Yes, the performance was a touch below par and the players were wasteful in front of goal, but it was no different to many, many matches in which this Spain side have scraped victories without much comment.
 The problem is that the reigning World Champions have always had to deal both with very high expectations and very cluttered memories of the recent past. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the same situation in 2013 with Finland and France.
 Perhaps being at the top for so long has left Spain needing a bit of danger in their lives to truly get the football juices flowing. A victory in France would put Del BosqueÃ¢ÂÂs side in control of their own destiny for the remaining three matches of the qualifying group. Anything less than three points will leave La Roja hoping France drop points away to Belarus and Georgia. While the situation could be worrying for Spain, itÃ¢ÂÂs unlikely to be critical, with the handy safety net of the play-offs acting as a fallback.
 History suggests that at least a draw is on the cards for Spain, given itÃ¢ÂÂs been 20 years since they lost a World Cup qualifying fixture. This leaves the flag-waving sections of the Madrid-based press caught in two minds about the contest. While there is an attempt to lift the spirits ahead of the game - the cover of Tuesday's _Marca_ shows the Eiffel Tower in the colours of the Spanish flag - thereÃ¢ÂÂs still not quite the same tension a World Cup knock- out match would have, with the knowledge that thereÃ¢ÂÂs a number of second chances for Del BosqueÃ¢ÂÂs side should things go wrong in Paris. Ã¢ÂÂThis team has won a lot of games, many more difficult than this one,Ã¢ÂÂ notes the editorial in _AS_.
 This qualifying phase for the 2014 World Cup is simply following the pattern of SpainÃ¢ÂÂs journeys over recent years. Everyone tends to remember the glorious arrival and the trophy-lifting, but they turn a blind eye to the wrong-turns, comedic stumbles and furious throwing of the map out the car window along the way.

The antibody tests purchased by the island are different from the typical nasal swab coronavirus tests, which only test for current infection and take days to process. The fingerprick test -- which provides results within 15 minutes -- detects antibodies the body creates to fight off the virus. It can determine if someone has already had the coronavirus and may be immune to it.
 While these antibody tests are already widely in use in China and South Korea, they are still being developed in the US and are difficult to secure. In short, the antibody tests are a class above the regular tests that are already in short supply around the country. One might even call them elite.
 According to an April 7 letter to Fisher Island residents that was viewed by Business Insider and signed by Dr. Elizabeth Greig, medical director of UHealth Fisher Island, the tests would be used to "monitor how spread occurs in a nearly contained environment, unlike anywhere else in the world." Greig neither confirmed nor denied to Business Insider that she had written the letter.
 Testing on the island, the letter detailed, would serve as a foil to a recent UHealth and Miami-Dade County partnership: As of April 3, a separate new program would randomly test 750 people across Miami-Dade County per week to assess how far the coronavirus has spread in South Florida.
 Participation would be voluntary, according to the letter, and testing would take place "building by building."

Euro 2020 will be held in 13 cities across the continent and the semi-finals and final will be played in the same stadium, European football's governing body UEFA said in January.


  "A tournament should be played in one country. That is how you create identity and euphoria," said Blatter, the head of world football's governing body.


  "They have fragmented the 2020 tournament. So it is not a European Championship any more. It has to have a different name," he told German _kicker_ magazine. "I do not know what name."


  "Such a Euro lacks heart and soul," said Blatter.


  UEFA said that 12 cities would be awarded a package of three group games plus one knockout game, either from the round of 16 or quarter-finals.


  A special 13th package would be awarded, consisting of the two semi-finals and final with UEFA eager to split the costs for the bigger tournament and celebrate its 60th anniversary across Europe.


  The Swiss sports administrator also said he planned to end his stint at the top of the world football's governing body in 2015 if FIFA was strong and stable.


  Blatter took over the top job in 1998.


  "I want to push through the FIFA reforms at our congress in Mauritius in May, then we go to Brazil for the World Cup in 2014 and after that everything is open."


  "When it is secured that FIFA will continue to be led like that, that it will remain global and the pyramid will not collapse then I will gladly hand over the sceptre to a new president," he said.


  UEFA boss Michel Platini is seen as a possible successor to Blatter.


  "I do not know if he wants to," said Blatter. "He has an idea about the future of FIFA which he has to explain to the continents at some point. But he has not decided yet."

So great a gift from the romcom gods is she that her character's rebound romance with Grey's Anatomy’s Jackson has almost made us forget the misfire that was "Jaggie." (Almost.) And in Thursday's episode, the actress reminded us that she's as adept at playing pathos as she is lighter fare. Though the human sunbeam was irresistibly funny in Vic's efforts to recruit and shoot her fellow firefighters for a sexy calendar, when the reason for the fundraiser came crashing down on her anew, her portrayer loosed a depiction of grief that felt altogether authentic. It was messy, breathless, raw. In other words, perfect.

Because the information is flowing, MLB officials insist on plans where to play, how to play and what are the countless scheduling possibilities that have been considered. But without more information on tests, antibodies, death rates and elected officials who will give their blessings, this is only theory and therefore it is not yet worth proposing to the union or engrave in stone. MLB has mainly remained silent and publicly unaligned on any plan - trying to avoid appearing insensitive to the public when there are such medical and economic difficulties in the country, and to recognize that if the green light comes, the office the commissioner must sell a defective plan (think: kicking the shin) to teams, players and fans. Because any plan will be vitiated by what is possible in current realities.

DOVER -- The national surge of coronavirus outbreaks inside long-term care facilities hit the Seacoast for the first time this week when five residents and five staff members tested positive at Bellamy Fields, a 50-bed memory care facility in Dover.


   


  The confirmed cases at Bellamy, recorded Wednesday, doubled Thursday to 20 people (12 residents and eight employees). The numbers are expected to continue to rise in coming days as health officials ramp up testing to more identify, contain and treat outbreaks at Bellamy and other long-term facilities in New Hampshire.


   


  "What we've seen is once COVID-19 gets into these close-living, congregate settings, the consequences can be very devastating," said state epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan. "Over half of the (37) deaths that we have identified from COVID-19 (as of Friday afternoon) are in long-term care facilities or associated with long-term care facility outbreaks, so we need to take a much more aggressive stance in protecting the residents and the staff in these facilities, and that is part of the reason for the newer recommendations around testing in these facilities."


   


  One way the state is increasing testing inside long-term care facilities is by dispatching its mobile response team to facilities that don't have the capacity or supplies to increase testing themselves.


   


  The Department of Health and Human Services unit, known as the Metropolitan Medical Response System, performed nasal swabs on approximately 20 residents at Bellamy Friday afternoon, according to Aaron McIntire, the team's commander.


   


  McIntire and seven other team members, many of whom are volunteers, dressed in full protective clothing and took special precautions to avoid spreading the virus while testing Bellamy residents Friday.


   


  Bellamy is segregating its residents with COVID-19 within a wing of its 150 Garrison Road facility, which, due to the pandemic, has been closed to visitors since March 15.


   


  Staff members weren't tested Friday, and infected staff are self-quarantining at home, said Bellamy owner Dr. John Hopkins. Hopkins said Bellamy will work with the state and its partners to ensure staff have full access to testing, though he said the company cannot legally make all employees submit to testing.

  Testing Bellamy residents took McIntire and his team about an hour Friday. The team then loaded the sealed samples onto the MMRS truck and delivered them to the state's public health lab in Concord.


   


  Before departing for Concord, McIntire echoed Chan's statement that early, thorough response is vital to address long-term care facility outbreaks.


   


  "The staff was phenomenal," McIntire said while describing Friday's testing inside Bellamy. "They make or break if this works out for us."


   


  At least 7,000 people living in or connected to long-term care facilities and nursing homes have died of the coronavirus across the country, according to a New York Times report released Friday and updated Saturday, with more updates likely.


   


  The Times also reported more than 36,500 facility residents and employees across the nation have contracted the virus, finding the facilities' small, confined settings and scarce protective equipment are fueling the outbreaks.


   


  In the Granite State, healthcare workers accounted for 30% of the state's 1,287 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Friday, according to Chan. As of Friday, 12,852 people had been tested in New Hampshire and 190 people who have tested positive have required hospitalization.


   


  "We want to identify rapidly all of those people because they can inform what we call cohorting -- putting all the people with COVID-19 together, identifying staff who may be asymptomatic so they are not caring for someone without COVID-19 to try and prevent further transmission in these facilities," Chan said.


   


  State health officials didn't confirm Friday whether any Bellamy residents had died due to COVID-19, nor did they confirm outbreaks at any other long- term care facilities on the Seacoast.


   


  State officials have linked the virus to deaths at long-term care facilities in Manchester and Nashua, however.


   


  Hopkins confirmed there have been deaths at Bellamy in the past week. He declined, however, to confirm how many deaths or to say if COVID-19 played a role.


   


  Hopkins said the cause of death determination is up to the state's medical examiner and that deaths aren't unusual at Bellamy because the facility provides hospice care.


   


  "You cannot attribute correlation and causality," Hopkins said. "You will probably see an obituary in the next day or two. Until the family goes through those channels, I think it's dangerous to mistake correlation with causality."


   


  Hopkins said he and his staff have been in regular communication with their residents and their residents' family members in order to keep them fully apprised of how staff are approaching care and protocols.


   


  According to Hopkins, managing a COVID-19 outbreak in a specialized facility like Bellamy poses additional challenges compared to other long-term care facilities, due to the varying cognitive impairments of its residents.


   


  That's why one of the facility's protocols include "letting their family members with dementia continue to move around the building rather than imposing behavioral restrictions that would be punitive for people with advanced dementia," according to a note on Bellamy's website.


   


  The daughter of one Bellamy resident, who declined to give her name for publication, said she's having difficulty dealing with the outbreak and the risk it potentially poses for her father.


   


  Hopkins said he hopes the results of Friday's testing comes back quickly to help ease the worry plaguing Bellamy residents, families and staff.


   


  "(The results are) what lots of families are waiting for and what we've been waiting for," said Hopkins, acknowledging there is no firm turnaround time for the results.


   


  In the meantime, Bellamy staff have adjusted their work schedules to accommodate changes in resident routines and the facility's enhanced personal protective equipment policy, Hopkins wrote in a statement after his phone interview.


   


  He said Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, the state and members of a local group called the Seacoast Mask Makers have all provided personal protective equipment to Bellamy.


   


  He also said Bellamy is taking various steps to support its employees.


   


  Those steps include $2 an hour raises. The company is also providing hotel accommodations "at no charge to employees whose families might have an elder or child at risk even for an asymptomatic employee," Hopkins said.

International breaks would be tremendously dull affairs were it not for footballers and managers shooting their mouths off, mindlessly ranting about how everything is rubbish and just not fair. La Liga Loca suspects many of them are well aware of the repercussions of these choice comments made away from the clutches of their respective clubÃ¢ÂÂs press officers.
 JosÃÂ© Mourinho certainly fell into that bracket when he told the Portuguese media the reasons he didn't travel to the FIFA Ballon dÃ¢ÂÂOr awards in January, instead choosing to remain in Madrid. Ã¢ÂÂTwo or three people called me and said Ã¢ÂÂI voted for you and the vote appeared for someone elseÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ revealed a mischievous Mourinho, who also admitted that perhaps his greatest pleasure at getting past Manchester United in the Champions League last 16 was that Ã¢ÂÂa lot of people werenÃ¢ÂÂt expecting it and were frustrated.Ã¢ÂÂ
 Ã¢ÂÂWhere is he going with this,Ã¢ÂÂ asked _Marca_ Ã¢ÂÂs Wednesday editorial. Ã¢ÂÂWhen he won in 2010, there were no complaints.Ã¢ÂÂ
 Sergio Ramos was also feeling frustrated after the win in Manchester, but instead about the reaction of Mourinho, who claimed that Ã¢ÂÂthe best team lostÃ¢ÂÂ.
 Ã¢ÂÂI would have liked for him to have said something else,Ã¢ÂÂ Ramos sniffed during preparations for SpainÃ¢ÂÂs double header against Finland and France.
 The latter of those opponents are set to field Karim Benzema, who has caused a bit of a hullaballoo in his own country by admitting that he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt bang out the countryÃ¢ÂÂs national anthem ahead of games. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve never sung it in my life and IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to now. Not doing it, wonÃ¢ÂÂt stop me from scoring a hat-trick,Ã¢ÂÂ noted Benzema quite reasonably. Ã¢ÂÂIf I score a lot of goals in a France game, nobody will ask if I sang _La Marseillaise_ before.Ã¢ÂÂ
 Although his comments drew criticism from FranceÃ¢ÂÂs National Front party, he was backed by Michel Platini, who admited he also hadnÃ¢ÂÂt one for a pre- match singalong back in the day. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a war song and for me, a football match is a sporting event, not war,Ã¢ÂÂ revealed the UEFA president.
 There was also a bit of bother in the Catalan capital, with Sandro Rosell telling children at a local school that Ã¢ÂÂthe fact that you speak Catalan, understand Catalan and are BarÃÂ§a fans in Catalonia, speaking Catalan is exactly what you should do, to show your feeling towards the club.Ã¢ÂÂ
 Espanyol get a little touchy about BarÃÂ§aÃ¢ÂÂs tendency to hog the big Catalan duvet, with club president Joan Collet responding that Ã¢ÂÂno club has the exclusivity nor patent on Catalanism. There are a lot of BarÃÂ§a members who donÃ¢ÂÂt speak Catalan and not everyone that does speak it is for BarÃÂ§a.Ã¢ÂÂ
 Deportivo's Augusto Lendoiro was another club president who felt like having his say, this time in response to a fairly damning report from the administrators that details a Ã¢ÂÂ¬156 million debt and states that staying in business is Ã¢ÂÂthe least bad optionÃ¢ÂÂ for Deportivo. Lendoiro clearly doesnÃ¢ÂÂt do humility, and responded with the impeccable logic that the same people who got Deportivo into such a mess should be the ones to get it out again. Ã¢ÂÂIf someone can save the club itÃ¢ÂÂs the current board. Who is going to know all this better than us?Ã¢ÂÂ
 Lendoiro also challenged the size of the debt reported, saw the lack of evidence of any theft or impropriety at the club as Ã¢ÂÂvery importantÃ¢ÂÂ and slammed the administrators for a perceived lack of communication. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs no relationship, IÃ¢ÂÂve asked to meet once a day ( _LLL_ suspects lunch was the idea for the chunky chieftain) but itÃ¢ÂÂs too much to ask.Ã¢ÂÂ
 ItÃ¢ÂÂs been a fine start to international week, and there's plenty more time for further mischief to be made.

RENO, Nev. (AP) — The Forest Service has approved the expansion of a ski resort on a national forest between Reno and Lake Tahoe, including a skier bridge over a highway as part of a package that also bans commercial development in areas cherished by conservationists and back-country enthusiasts. The expansion allows for construction of a 5-million-gallon (19-million-litre) water tank that will boost snow-making capabilities in an effort to transform the Mount Rose resort into a “key destination attraction,” agency officials said. In the works for more than seven years, it will provide new skiing and snowboarding terrain especially for beginners and those with less-advanced skills about 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Lake Tahoe and 25 miles (40 km) southwest of downtown Reno. “I think it's a good compromise,” Humboldt-Toiyabe Forest Supervisor Bill Dunkelberger said while signing the formal record of decision for a new special use permit this week. “It's been a long, long road.” Original expansion plans opposed by conservationists have been revised several times since the Forest Service started assessing potential environmental impacts in December 2012. “I think we've come up with the best decision that authorizes the ski area to expand, provide additional terrain for a variety of users and also protects the national forest and the resources on the forest,” Dunkelberger said. Rose Strickland, a longtime local leader of the Sierra Club and spokesperson for Friends of Mount Rose, cheered the new agreement. Conservationists have been working for more than three decades to help protect the natural environment around the resort, Strickland said. She said that stretch of the Sierra Nevada's Carson Range long has been treasured by hikers, campers, mountain...

Pedro has been in fine form for his country in recent months and his 58th- minute effort in a tight game at the Stade de France was his 10th goal in his last six starts.


  He collected the ball on the right, cut inside and lifted a pass out to Nacho Monreal on the left before surging into the penalty area to bundle Monreal's low centre past France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.


  "Pedro is very important for us because he compliments the passing of Xabi Alonso, Xavi and [Sergio] Busquets with his explosive, dynamic movement," Del Bosque told a news conference.


  "We still have three matches to go when both France and ourselves could slip up but we are definitely in an advantageous position," he added.


  "The three points were the important thing and also that the players passed this test of their maturity."


  Spain were under pressure after Friday's 1-1 draw at home to Finland left them two points behind France, who held Spain to a 1-1 stalemate in Madrid in October, with four games left.


  Xavi for the visitors and Franck Ribery for the home side had excellent chances in the first half before Pedro edged Spain ahead and they were able to shut the game down with some controlled possession.


  "It was crucial to win here," Pedro said in an interview with Spanish television.


  "We could not slip up and I am pleased with the way everything turned out," added the 25-year-old, who now has 12 goals in 26 appearances for Spain.


  "I arrived on the run, touched the ball and it went in but I am not really sure how I did it."


  Spain now begin their preparations for the Confederations Cup in Brazil in June. Their next World Cup qualifier is away to Finland in September and they play their final two games at home to Belarus and Georgia in October.

"Atletico Madrid and Diego Pablo Simeone have reached an agreement on the coach's contract extension for the next four seasons," the La Liga club said in a statement on their website on Tuesday.


  Argentine Simeone, who will be 43 next month, took over after the sacking of Gregorio Manzano midway through last season and promptly led the side to Europa League glory with victory over Spanish rivals Athletic Bilbao in the final.


  Atletico went on to beat continental champions Chelsea to win the European Super Cup and are riding high in second in La Liga and through to face city rivals Real Madrid in the King's Cup final.


  A combative midfielder described as "playing with a knife between his teeth", the no-nonsense Simeone has transformed the team into a tight defensive unit and the goals of Colombia striker Radamel Falcao have helped underpin their success.


  Simeone helped Atletico win the La Liga and King's Cup double in 1996 before moving on the following year and returned to the club for a second playing stint between 2003 and 2005.


  A four-year contract is rare in Spain, known for its impatient club presidents and demanding fans.

 As a clearer picture emerges of COVID-19's decidedly deadly toll on Black Americans, leaders are demanding a reckoning of the systemic policies they say have made many African Americans far more vulnerable to the virus, including inequity in access to health care and economic opportunity.
 A growing chorus of medical professionals, activists and political figures are pressuring the federal government to not just release comprehensive racial demographic data of the country's coronavirus victims, but also to outline clear strategies to blunt the devastation on African Americans and other communities of colour.
 On Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its first breakdown of COVID-19 case data by race, showing that 30 per cent of patients whose race was known were Black. The federal data was missing racial information for 75 per cent of all cases, however, and did not include any demographic breakdown of deaths.
 The latest Associated Press analysis of available state and local data shows that nearly one-third of those who have died are African American, with Black people representing about 14 per cent of the population in the areas covered in the analysis.
 Roughly half the states, representing less than a fifth of the nation's COVID-19 deaths, have yet to release demographic data on fatalities. In states that have, about a quarter of the death records are missing racial details.
 Health conditions that exist at higher rates in the Black community -- obesity, diabetes and asthma -- make African Americans more susceptible to the virus. They also are more likely to be uninsured, and often report that medical professionals take their ailments less seriously when they seek treatment.
 "It's America's unfinished business -- we're free, but not equal," civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson told the AP. "There's a reality check that has been brought by the coronavirus, that exposes the weakness and the opportunity."
 This week, Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition and the National Medical Association, a group representing African American physicians and patients, released a joint public health strategy calling for better COVID-19 testing and treatment data. The groups also urged officials to provide better protections for incarcerated populations and to recruit more African Americans to the medical field.
 Jackson also expressed support for a national commission to study the Black COVID-19 toll modelled after the Kerner Commission, which studied the root causes of race riots in African American communities in the 1960s and made policy recommendations to prevent future unrest.
 Daniel Dawes, director of Morehouse College's School of Medicine's Satcher Health Leadership Institute, said America's history of segregation and policies led to the racial health disparities that exist today.
 "If we do not take an appreciation for the historical context and the political determinants, then we're only merely going to nibble around the edges of the problem of inequities," he said.
 The release of demographic data for the country's coronavirus victims remains a priority for many civil rights and public health advocates, who say the numbers are needed to address disparities in the national response to the pandemic.
 The AP analysis, based on data through Thursday, found that of the more than 21,500 victims whose demographic data was known and disclosed by officials, more than 6,350 were Black, a rate of nearly 30 per cent. African Americans account for 14.2 per cent of the 241 million people who live in the areas covered by the analysis, which encompasses 24 states and the cities of Washington D.C., Houston, Memphis, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia -- places where statewide data was unavailable.
 The nation had recorded more than 33,000 deaths as of Thursday.
 In some areas, Native American communities also have been hit hard. In New Mexico, Native Americans account for nearly 37 per cent of the state's 1,484 cases and about 11 per cent of the state's population. Of the 112 deaths where race is known in Arizona, 30 were Native Americans.
 After Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation this week to try to compel federal health officials to post daily data breaking down cases and deaths by race, ethnicity and other demographics, the CDC released only caseload data that -- similar to the AP's analysis of deaths -- show 30 per cent of 111,633 infected patients whose race is known were Black. African American patients in the 45-to-64 and 65-to-74 age groups represented an even larger share of the national caseload.
 The lawmakers sent a letter last month to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar urging federal release of the demographic data. And Joe Biden, the former vice-president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, also called for its release.
 Meanwhile, some Black leaders have described the Trump administration's response to COVID-19 as inadequate, after what they said was a hastily organized call with Vice-President Mike Pence and CDC director Robert Redfield last week.
 According to a recording of the call obtained by the AP, Redfield said the CDC has been collecting demographic data from death certificates but that the comprehensiveness of the data depends on state and local health departments, many of which are overburdened by virus response. No plan was offered to help health officials in hard-hit communities collect the data, leaders who were on the call said.
 Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which took part in the call, said African Americans "have every reason to be alarmed at the administration's anemic response to the disproportionate impact that this crisis is having on communities of colour."
 Mistrust runs deep among residents in many communities.
 St. Louis resident Randy Barnes is grappling not just with the emotional toll of losing his brother to the coronavirus, but also with the feeling that his brother's case was not taken seriously.
 Barnes said the hospital where his brother sought treatment initially sent him home without testing him and suggested he self-quarantine for 14 days. Five days later, his brother was back in hospital, where he was placed on a ventilator for two weeks. He died April 13. Barnes' brother and his wife also were caring for an 88-year-old man in the same apartment, who died from the virus around the same time.
 "Those people are not being tested. They're not being cared for," Barnes said.
 Eugene Rush lives in one of the areas outside large urban cities that have been hit hard with coronavirus cases. He is a sergeant for the sheriff's department in Michigan's Washtenaw County, west of Detroit, where Black residents account for 46 per cent of the COVID-19 cases but represent only 12 per cent of the county's population.
 Rush, whose job includes community engagement, was diagnosed with COVID-19 near the end of March after what he initially thought was just a sinus infection. He had to be hospitalized twice, but is now on the mend at home, along with his 16-year-old son, who also was diagnosed with COVID-19.
 "I had a former lieutenant for the city of Ypsilanti who passed while I was in the hospital and I had some fraternity brothers who caught the virus and were sick at the hospital," Rush said. "At that point, I said, 'Well, this is really, really affecting a lot of people' and they were mostly African American. That's how I knew that it was really taking a toll a little bit deeper in the African American community than I realized."

Associated Press writers Noreen Nasir in Chicago, Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia, Regina Garcia Cano in Washington, Chris Grygiel in Seattle and Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed.

  Meanwhile, some Black leaders have described the Trump administration's response to COVID-19 as inadequate, after what they said was a hastily organized call with Vice-President Mike Pence and CDC director Robert Redfield last week.


  According to a recording of the call obtained by the AP, Redfield said the CDC has been collecting demographic data from death certificates but that the comprehensiveness of the data depends on state and local health departments, many of which are overburdened by virus response. No plan was offered to help health officials in hard-hit communities collect the data, leaders who were on the call said.


  Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which took part in the call, said African Americans "have every reason to be alarmed at the administration's anemic response to the disproportionate impact that this crisis is having on communities of colour."


  Mistrust runs deep among residents in many communities.


  St. Louis resident Randy Barnes is grappling not just with the emotional toll of losing his brother to the coronavirus, but also with the feeling that his brother's case was not taken seriously.


  Barnes said the hospital where his brother sought treatment initially sent him home without testing him and suggested he self-quarantine for 14 days. Five days later, his brother was back in hospital, where he was placed on a ventilator for two weeks. He died April 13. Barnes' brother and his wife also were caring for an 88-year-old man in the same apartment, who died from the virus around the same time.


  "Those people are not being tested. They're not being cared for," Barnes said.


  Eugene Rush lives in one of the areas outside large urban cities that have been hit hard with coronavirus cases. He is a sergeant for the sheriff's department in Michigan's Washtenaw County, west of Detroit, where Black residents account for 46 per cent of the COVID-19 cases but represent only 12 per cent of the county's population.


  Rush, whose job includes community engagement, was diagnosed with COVID-19 near the end of March after what he initially thought was just a sinus infection. He had to be hospitalized twice, but is now on the mend at home, along with his 16-year-old son, who also was diagnosed with COVID-19.


  "I had a former lieutenant for the city of Ypsilanti who passed while I was in the hospital and I had some fraternity brothers who caught the virus and were sick at the hospital," Rush said. "At that point, I said, 'Well, this is really, really affecting a lot of people' and they were mostly African American. That's how I knew that it was really taking a toll a little bit deeper in the African American community than I realized."

That beloved childhood home, a low-slung oceanfront compound purchased in 1976 by her parents, Lynne and Henryk, the dashing but penniless Polish refugee turned World War II fighter pilot who went on to amass a fortune in business and become a revered figure on the horse-racing scene, served as an unwitting siren song, calling her back in 2016 to oversee repairs to damage caused by Hurricane Matthew. While there, on a lark, she and Gilardini looked at a house for sale just a short golf-cart ride away.

For weeks, public health experts have emphasized washing hands properly is an easy but effective way to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 Despite COVID-19, South Lorain residents are asked to limit water usage in their homes when the sanitary sewer work takes place starting the week of April 20.
 On April 13, the city announced the project known as the “Year 2 Sewer and Manhole Lining Project.”
 Contractor Insituform will install liners in sanitary sewer pipes to seal the lines. That prevents storm water from leaking into cracks or leaky joints in the sanitary sewer lines.
 The work will take place generally in the alleys between East 28th and 36th streets, from Globe Avenue east to Pearl Avenue, in South Lorain.
 Installation of the liners is scheduled to begin April 20, said Douglas Dietzel, environmental manager for the city Utilities Department.
 The liners will create temporary barriers between sewer laterals running from houses to the city sanitary sewer lines.
 Because water runs down the drain and out of the house through the laterals, residents are asked to limit water use to washing hands and no more than two toilet flushes.
 Residents are asked to not wash dishes or clothes and they should not take showers or baths during the work, according to Insituform.
 Residents also should look for informational doorhangers with guidance about limiting water usage during the project.
 The work is considered an essential infrastructure repair, according to the contractor.

“I have always let my coaches know that I support them 100 percent, as long as they are meeting the expectations of our school system,” Warren said. “Not in terms of wins and losses, but in how they compete. I want them all to strive to be the best coach and role model possible for our kids.”
 Warren said serving as athletic director goes well beyond watching games.
 “The biggest misnomer is that ADs just watch bunch of games all the time, how hard can that be?” he said. “The fact is, most of the time we rarely get to watch much of our home games. Between taking care of ticket takers, concession workers, keeping an eye on the crowd, checking bathrooms, there isn’t a lot of time to watch the actual games.”
 Another responsibility of an athletic director is responding to concerns from parents and athletes. Several years ago, Warren said a girls basketball parent came into his office after his daughter had played sparingly in a blowout loss. Warren anticipated a complaint regarding playing time, but it turned into a moment that left him speechless.
 “I’m not saying my daughter is better than anyone else on the team, but she can shoot airballs just as well as the rest of the team,” the dad told Warren. “It’s the only time in my 20 years as an AD that I had no answer for a parent. All I could say was, ‘Yeah, you’re right.’”
 There were plenty of memorable moments during Warren’s career as coach and athletic director. He was an assistant coach on the Mountaineers' 1999 football VHSL Group A state championship team. Madison County won a boys soccer title in his first year as athletic director and followed that up with state championships in boys basketball in 2010 and softball in 2017.
 In addition, Clare Moretz's four individual state titles in track and Kara Morgan McHaney winning the school’s first state championship in swimming are lasting memories.
 “I don’t think people realize how difficult it is to win a state title,” Warren said. "It is also really fun to watch athletes whose parents I either coached or watched play come through our program. That is definitely a sign of age when you are working with the kids of athletes you used to coach.”
 Warren said the support for Madison County athletics from the community has been overwhelming. He said they helped sell out Eastern Mennonite University for a regional boys basketball championship game in 2010. The fans came in droves to watch the baseball and softball teams play at Radford too. Last fall, the school sent two busloads of students to Poquoson, a 2 1/2 -hour drive and filled their gym up on a school night for a state semifinal volleyball game.
 “It’s hard to pick out what I am most proud of, but if I had to pick one, I would say the community support that we get is amazing,” Warren said. “Our community support is really something to see if you aren’t used to it. I can’t tell you the number of ADs that have commented on the number of people that come to our games.”
 The decision to step down was not an easy one for Warren, but something that’s been on his mind for a number of years.
 “I just felt like it was time to retire,” Warren said. “Thirty-five years in the same school is a long time, plus working four to five nights a week until 10 or 11 o’clock is getting harder to do at my age. I’m not as young as I used to be.”
 Warren said he doesn’t really have any detailed plans for retirement, other than spending more time with his grandchildren, who live in nearby Orange County.
 “Besides that, I hope to get in a little more time on the golf course,” he said. “That’s really about it until I get bored, then I guess I will find something to do with my time.”
 After more than 30 years of coaching and teaching, Warren said there’s no place he’d rather have been.
 “I love Madison County,” Warren said. “I love the area. I love the people. I live the school. I feel very blessed here. I have had numerous opportunities to leave and make more money, but at the end of the day, I never strongly considered leaving Madison. I have never been a big fan of change, so why leave when you are comfortable and really enjoying your job.”

The coronavirus lockdown has massively disrupted India's supply chain, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Saturday. Speaking at a virtual session on 'COVID-19 & The Future of Work', Kant further said the pandemic has created a unique challenge, which is complex and unpredictable.


  "We are passing through a very turbulent time. Our supply chain will get massively disrupted," he said. India is on a 40-day lockdown till May 3 to contain the spread of the coronavirus.


  Also participating in the session, World Bank Country Director (India) Junaid Kamal Ahmad said for developing countries, it is important that the state changes the way it works. Ayushman Bharat scheme was a great step but in the coming years, it is imperative to ensure India goes beyond it, he added.


  TeamLease Chairman Manish Sabharwal said, "Work from home has provided continuity but also has to ensure productivity. In the long run, we have to ensure that remote working is beneficial for all." Sabharwal said the virus has shown that India's economy has three existing conditions that are problems -- we are much less formalised, much less urbanised and have much less financial inclusion. "Essentially, our labour is handicapped without capital and our capital is handicapped without labour," he said adding that the economy needs a dose of labour, social security, financial and education reforms to tap the opportunity offered by this crisis.


  He added that the country needs a dose of education reforms. "Ayatollahs of education and UGC have made sure that only 30 universities out of 800 can offer online learning in this crisis. US institutions have signed up 200,000 Indian students during the past one month." NASSCOM President Debjani Gosh said the COVID-19 pandemic will change work spaces forever, give a huge boost to the gig economy and ensure a better balance in the workspace, ensuring more participation of the female workforce. Hero Enterprise Chairman Sunil Munjal said India has the potential to take over the supply chain of the world.


  "We are well-positioned, rated as better managers of the COVID-19 crisis. We have the ability to attract more ideas and talent, all we have to do is repurpose ourselves," Munjal said..

In terms of natural talent there are few defenders in the Scottish game right now like John Souttar. The Hearts and Scotland centre-back is renowned for his ability on the ball and would give Celtic a different dimension at the back. In theory, Souttar would be the ideal partner for Jullien who is slightly more orthodox in his defensive style.


  However, injuries have dogged Souttar for a number of years. The 23-year-old has struggled to string a number of performances together due to his lack of fitness and so any move for the Hearts man would be a gamble. Celtic might still be drawn to Souttar’s undeniable potential, though.

The England international has been out with an ankle problem since the start of the month, but it had been rumoured he was in line for a weekend return.


  "Regarding Jack? I think two weeks on Sunday. Not the next game, but the game after," Wenger told reporters.


  Arsenal travel to West Bromwich Albion on April 6 and then host Norwich City a week later.


  The 21-year-old playmaker's return can not come soon enough for Arsenal who are battling London rivals Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea for Champions League qualification.


  Left-back Kieran Gibbs is a doubt for Saturday's home match with flu while forward Theo Walcott is definitely out, having suffered a muscle tear in training while on international duty with England.


  Wenger, however, refused to point the finger of blame at England manager Roy Hodgson.


  "Walcott is an accident that could have happened here," Wenger said.


  "I have no conversation with the England manager. He uses the players how he wants to use them."


  Arsenal have no realistic hope of silverware this season having exited the FA Cup and Champions League in recent weeks, but a good run of form in the Premier League has given Wenger cause for optimism.


  The North London club have won four of their last five Premier League games and are fifth in the table, four points behind Tottenham in fourth but with a game in hand. Chelsea are a further point clear in third.


  "We've got nine games to go, five at home and four away. The form we showed against Bayern [in the Champions League last 16 second leg] was very good. We have a chance to finish in the top four," Wenger said.


  "We have the experience of a few years and a special desire to do it together. It's a good opportunity for us. We want to grab this chance. If we are consistent we will do it. We're not focused on Tottenham, but the way we want to play."


  Reading are second from bottom in the Premier League and seven points from safety but are likely to be buoyed by the appointment of new manager Nigel Adkins, who joined the club on Tuesday.

The outbreak of coronavirus at a key naval facility in Mumbai infecting 26 sailors is a wake-up call for stricter implementation of all laid down norms to insulate around 15 lakh armed forces personnel from the pandemic, military officials said on Saturday. All the three forces have already enforced a "no movement" policy under which almost all their bases have been put under total lockdown barring the wings handling key operational matters and strategic surveillance, they said.


  Official sources said the top brass in the defence ministry is reviewing the overall preparedness of the armed forces to deal with the pandemic. The Navy has strictly ordered all its bases to not allow any movement of its personnel and assets besides suspending all training activities after the first case of the infection was detected on April 7, a Navy official said.


  The Navy has suspended all transfers and fresh postings besides ordering people on leave to stay back home. Those on board various ships and other platforms were told to extend their stay, he said. "We are now restricting movement of people from one building to another building inside the bases and commands. We are restricting any movement to and from the bases," said another official.


  Former Navy Spokesperson Capt (retd) D K Sharma said the situation is "very dangerous" and all wings of the armed forces must follow the instructions of the prime minister as well as the service chiefs. "People should follow the guidelines in letter and spirit. If the prime minister and the services chiefs are saying that coronavirus is a hidden enemy, if they are saying that it is a huge challenge, then lets take the challenge head on," he said.


  "We should not let our guard down. Now the strength is not in being together, the strength is in being isolated," Sharma said An Indian Air Force official said the Air Headquarters have issued specific guidelines to all the bases and establishments to insulate the personnel as well as platforms from the virus. The IAF has not reported any case of the infection so far. He said the aircraft sent on various evacuation missions to coronavirus-infected countries were too "quarantined" for 14 days besides being "disinfected" thoroughly.


  An Army official said a "rigorous protocol" is being followed at all the bases and establishments of the force to protect the 15 lakh armymen from the virus. Listing the measures, he said all the establishments are operating with skeleton staff and people coming back from leave or emergency out-station assignments are being made to stay "separately" for at least couple of weeks.


  "We are even extending the distance between the beds in barracks. It is an invisible war we are fighting," the official said. About front-line bases along borders with Pakistan and China, the official said stricter norms are being followed to insulate them and that chances of the virus travelling to the areas were minimum.


  The official said movement of people in 62 cantonments has also been strictly restricted as part of precautionary measures. All the infected sailors of the Navy were serving at the INS Angre in Mumbai, a shore-based logistics and support establishment, and they are currently undergoing treatment at a Navy hospital.


  The Navy has launched a large-scale contact tracing operation to track people who may have come in contact with the sailors. Almost all the residents of the building inside INS Angre are being tested, the sources said. The Western Naval Command is considered a strategic establishment as it takes care of India's maritime interests in the the Arabian Sea as well as parts of the Indian Ocean. The Naval dockyard in Mumbai is only few hundred metres away from INS Angre.


  The outbreak of the coronavirus cases in Western Naval Command comes at a time when a number of navies globally are grappling with the pandemic. Over 660 sailors on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier of the US Navy, reported coronavirus infection. A third of the nearly 2,000 sailors on board French Navy's aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle and its support ships also infected the virus.


  The Indian Army on Thursday directed all its military establishments, cantonments, formation headquarters and field units to totally restrict movement of forces till April 19 in view of the government's fresh lockdown related guidelines. The order also mentioned that offices in Army headquarters, command headquarters and formation headquarters would start functioning with 50 per cent manpower from April 19 to May 3.


  It said all training activities and temporary duties will remain suspended till May 3, adding directions on actions to be taken post the lockdown period will be issued on receipt of fresh orders from the government. In a statement, the Navy said the detection of coronavirus cases is a result of meticulous contact tracing and aggressive screening as well as testing of people in a shore-based establishment after one sailor tested positive for the infection on April 7.


  All the infected sailors were staying at a bachelors' residential block at the INS Angre, a shore-based logistics and support establishment, just few hundred metres away from the main Naval dockyard housing a range of front-line warships and submarines of the force..

From increasing production of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits to manufacturing prototypes of ventilators, defence public sector undertakings and the ordnance factory board have ramped up efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic in the country. These vital institutions of the Department of Defence Production (DDP) under the Ministry of Defence have channelised all their resources, technical knowhow and manpower to help the nation mitigate the deadly virus, officials said.


  Defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Bengaluru, has set up isolation ward facility with three beds in intensive care unit and 30 beds in wards, the defence ministry said in a statement. In addition, a building with 30 rooms has been readied. In all, the HAL facility can accommodate 93 people. HAL has manufactured and distributed 25 PPEs to doctors in various hospitals in Bengaluru that are authorised to treat COVID-19 patients. It has also manufactured 160 aerosol boxes which have been distributed to various government hospitals in Bengaluru, Mysore, Mumbai, Pune, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the statement added. DPSUs and the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) have assisted civilian administration in fight against COVID-19, the ministry said.


  Bharat Electronic Limited (BEL), another DPSU, has come forward on the directions of the health ministry to manufacture and supply 30,000 ventilators to ICUs in the country within two months. The design of these ventilators was originally developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation and later improved by Skanray, Mysore, with whom BEL has collaborated, it said. BEL is likely to start manufacturing of ventilators between April 20-24. As per the tentative schedule, BEL is expected to manufacture 5,000 units in April, 10,000 in May and 15,000 in June. It is also making efforts to indigenise these components with the help of DRDO, the statement said.


  Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) is developing a prototype of ventilator which is likely to be tested and certified by the first week of May before it starts with manufacturing. It is working on this project with the help of a private start-up of Pune, the ministry said. Also, the Ordnance Factory Board, which heads 40 ordnance factories in the country, has started supply of coveralls conforming to ISO class 3 exposure standards. Manufacture of the initial order of 1.10 lakh from HLL Lifecare Limited (HLL) is in full swing and it will be completed in 40 days, it said.


  Ordnance Equipment Group of factories located at Kanpur, Shahjahanpur, Hazratpur (Firozabad) and Chennai are engaged in manufacturing coveralls. The present production rate is 800 per day and efforts are on to ramp up to a level of 1,500 per day, the statement said. For testing the efficacy of coveralls and masks, it has developed three machines which have been approved by South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) and are to be used in production to maintain the standards. The Ordnance Factory Board has also manufactured 5,870 PPEs which have been distributed to HLL, CMO, Firozabad, besides its own hospitals in ordnance factories, it added.


  The OFB has also developed special two-metre tents which can be used for medical emergency, screening, hospital triage and quarantine purposes. Ordinance factories are presently producing 7,500 litres of sanitisers against an order of 28,000 litres from HLL, the nodal agency appointed by the Government of India for centralised procurement. The OFB has so far manufactured 1,11,405 masks which include 38,520 three-ply medical masks. These have been distributed to Tamil Nadu Police, district civil and police authorities in Firozabad and Agra, the Cantonment Board Shahjahanpur, the Government of Uttarakhand, the district health officer Shahjahanpur, Military Intelligence, etc, it said..

To rebound from the pandemic, Africa must maintain adequate food reserves, avoid protectionist policies and promote value chains that link domestic and international markets. As the Bank takes a key role in supporting African countries to design and implement coordinated policy responses, it will work with regional partners including the African Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, as well as international ones such as the World Trade Organization, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Bank, and other international partners.

Sailogy.com and many other charter companies now have more flexibility options and cancellation protection to encourage customers to make new bookings.


  Jonathan Beckett, chief executive of Burgess Yachts, said that apart from helping some luxury boat owners take their families to sea “to weather the storm” of the virus, his firm has also organized three or four “isolation charters” for customers looking to lock down by anchoring in a pleasant spot.


  “One was for four weeks but is likely to extend, I think,” he said. “One was for eight weeks and I think will also extend if the crisis continues.”


  One Burgess client, a family, is dealing with their son’s schooling by having him get up at 4 a.m. for an online lesson with a teacher back in his home time zone, dressed in his school uniform to encourage routine.


  Another family, renting “quite a sizable yacht,” is supplementing their home schooling with cooking lessons from the chef and time in the engine room with the engineer.


  Beckett said his firm has the Olivia, a 226-foot explorer yacht, available in Monaco for sale or charter with a 15,000-mile range and four or five months of supplies onboard.

New York will play its next season in the Barclays Center, the same arena Joe Harris and the Brooklyn Nets play their games. It’s a team looking to become a popular and successful WNBA franchise, and the additions in the draft set New York up for its desired success.
 Given the sheer volume of young stars now on the roster, the rebuild in New York might not take very long.
 “I think we’ll be young, but young teams are often exciting to watch and have a lot of growth and just potential,” Willoughby said. “I’m really, really excited about it.”
 Playing in New York keeps Willoughby close to home.
 The New Jersey native lives about an hour from Brooklyn, and she grew up attending Liberty games. She clarified that she wasn’t a season-ticket holder or anything growing up, but she went to games through class field trips and considers the Liberty her hometown team.
 Now she’ll play for them.
 “Just knowing that they’re the local team and to play on it is special for me,” Willoughby said.
 When WNBA training camp begins, Willoughby will team up with three other ACC players drafted by the Liberty as well as UConn’s top draft pick and Ionescu, who is considered a generational WNBA talent. UVa’s talented wing will compete on a star-studded professional team that plays closest to home.
 It’s a dream come true for one of the top UVa players of the past decade.
 “It just means the world, and I think all the years of hard work — and granted at that time I didn’t know where I would be going or even that I would be in the WNBA — but to see everything come full circle is really humbling,” Willoughby said, “and I just feel so blessed to have this opportunity.”

O’Riordan was initially portrayed as an innocent naif, perhaps because she spent her youth singing in church and spoke softly with the sweetest of accents. But there was nothing particularly delicate or winsome about O’Riordan in person, it has to be said. She dressed provocatively, spoke with conviction and generally comported herself with a very Irish quality of cheery friendliness. She was quite capable of drinking most of her band mates under the table. When I interviewed her for the Telegraph in 1999, she clattered in late complaining of an eight-pint hangover. “D’you ever go out sober and sit with a bunch of drunken people? It’s so boring, man!” she explained. “So you have to get involved and start slapping it back yourself!”

"It was like the Devil opened his mouth and made a noise that was all screaming!" Joe recalled, gesticulating as if trying to wave away the memory of "body parts all over the deck," while any intact seamen were "charred to the bone." Joe's recollection got personal, and Lloyd broke down sobbing, as he described fishing three men out of the water, including his friend Ozzy: "We should have been tossing a football!"

Lately, travel restrictions imposed due to the lockdown measure has made these applications quite popular. Presently, the majority of non-essential service sector manpower is working from home. Many business establishments are heavily reliant on these applications to coordinate their workforce and conduct meetings.


  The nationwide lockdown, which has been deemed necessary to curb the spread of Covid-19, has dealt a heavy blow to the service sector, leading to a temporary closure of shopping malls and restaurants, shutting down offices and deserting market places.


  At present, major IT players, including Microsoft Teams and Cisco Webex, have developed such applications which differ in features but offer the commonality of allowing for video-conferencing using mobile phones.

HONORABLE MENTION | The abduction of Captain Holt’s beloved dog Cheddar provided Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Andre Braugher with a wildly entertaining showcase. We could have easily written a couple of hundred words about his exquisite deadpan alone, specifically how he dryly referred to the kidnapped corgi as his "fluffy boy." Even more impressive, though, was how he managed to portray the typically stoic precinct chief as both an unhinged badass and a total screwball when he finally came face to face with Cheddar’s captor. He went full-blown "John Wick" on the guy — and the "sumbitch" didn’t know what he had coming. Just like Jake, we were grinning from ear to ear as Holt warned of a "s—tstorm" about to rain down on the perp. Holt’s tone conveyed strong contempt for the dognapper, while Braugher’s spirited delivery made us laugh until our sides hurt.
