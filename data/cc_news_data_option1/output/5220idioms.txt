DANVILLE — Vermilion County Farm Bureau is pleased to announce its annual award winners presented at our 102nd Annual Meeting in early December.
 Mark Willard, of Rossville, was presented the Farm Bureau Distinguished Service Award for 2020. Mark has been a great supporter of VCFB. He served on the Board of Directors for 17 years (1999-2016), including 12 as an officer. He’s been a strong member recruiter, being recognized multiple times with the IFB Director Five distinction, for signing five or more new members. He continues to contact friends and neighbors to encourage their ongoing Farm Bureau membership. Ag in the Classroom (AITC) has been another of Mark’s passions with Farm Bureau. When his wife, Susie, was a teacher at Liberty School in Danville, Mark would visit her class and talk about being a farmer. He’s also worked with her on the AITC partnership with the Douglas Discovery Garden, building garden boxes for student to plant seedlings in at the garden. Mark has served on the Vermilion County Farm Bureau Foundation Board of Trustees since its inception in 2008. He served as the interlocking member with the Farm Bureau board, including being chairman for the last eight years.
 The Ag in the Classroom Teacher of the Year Award winner is Joan Dale, of Schlarman Academy in Danville. Joan has been a teacher in Vermilion County for 25 years, with 20 of those years in Danville District 118. She’s been teaching Language Arts teacher for 4th through 6th graders at Schlarman the last five years. She has utilized Ag in the Classroom for nearly all those years. Last spring when schools shut down, Mrs. Dale was one of the teachers that used our Grab & Go activity bags for remote lessons. And she’s been incorporating the current Zoom AITC lessons with her students. She first came to Danville from the south Chicago suburbs 32 years ago, and admits that she and her students alike have learned so much about farming and food through Ag in the Classroom.
 And the Spokesperson of the Year Award was given to Curt Elmore, of Allerton. Curt farms in the Sidell and Allerton area. He has been active in Farm Bureau with the Young Leaders Committee and has served on the Board of Directors since 2015. He has written farming articles for The Sidell Reporter for the last 12 years. His topics have covered farm safety, issues impacting farmers and National Agriculture Week.

Millions of Italians braced for Christmas and New Year under tough new coronavirus restrictions announced Saturday as Europe battled a winter surge in infections and Switzerland became the latest country to approve a virus vaccine.
 Europe has become the first region in the world to pass 500,000 deaths from Covid-19 since the pandemic broke out a year ago, killing more than 1.6 million worldwide and pitching the global economy into turmoil.
 Among those testing positive this week for coronavirus was French President Emmanuel Macron, but his office said on Saturday his condition was stable and his examinations were giving reassuring results.
 Italy became the latest country to announce a new regime of restrictions until January 6 that included limits on people leaving their homes more than once a day, closing non-essential shops, bars and restaurants and curbs on regional travel.
 "It's right that they prohibit departures after 20 December if it means travelling in safety," Claudia Patrone, a 33-year-old lawyer, told AFP as she got off a train in Milan.
 "I took the test before leaving, I stayed locked in my house, I didn't see anyone. The measure is right if everyone respects the rules and guarantees safety."
 Europe -- the epicentre of the pandemic earlier this year -- is once again seeing growing cases with officials fearing an explosion in infections after the Christmas holidays as families gather.
 England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty confirmed Saturday that a new coronavirus strain which surfaced in the country could spread faster and called for greater public vigilance to reduce transmission.
 A year after the pandemic first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the rapid rollout of vaccinations is now seen as the only effective way to end the pandemic and the economically devastating lockdowns used to halt its spread.
 Europe is expected to start a massive vaccination campaign after Christmas following the United States and Britain which have begun giving jabs with an approved Pfizer-BioNTech shot, one of several leading candidates.
 Russia and China have also started giving out jabs with their own domestically produced vaccines.
 Swiss regulators on Saturday give the green light to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- the 16th country to do so and the first in continental Europe -- with immunisation set to start within days.
 "Those who are particularly vulnerable will have priority," Health Minister Alain Berset said in a video tweet, namely the elderly and those with pre- existing conditions.
 \- Worst-hit nation -
 The United States on Friday authorised Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, paving the way for millions of doses of a second jab to be shipped across the hardest-hit country in the world.
 The United States is the first nation to authorise the two-dose regimen from Moderna, now the second vaccine to be deployed in a Western country after the one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.
 Millions of doses will start shipping out as early as this weekend from cold- storage sites outside Memphis and Louisville.
 With the United States now registering more than 2,500 deaths a day from Covid-19, senior US officials including Vice President Mike Pence stepped up to receive early vaccinations on Friday.
 Pence's public inoculation was the most high-profile attempt yet at persuading vaccine-skeptic Americans to join a national effort to halt a pandemic that has infected more than 74 million worldwide.
 President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office on January 20, announced he would take the vaccine, also in public, on Monday.
 In Europe, Slovakian Prime Minister Igor Matovic became the latest high- profile figure to test positive for Covid-19 a week after attending a European Union summit in Brussels.
 The summit is believed to be where Macron also caught the virus. Macron's diagnosis on Thursday led to a host of European leaders and French officials rushing into self-isolation.
 Macron, who is working in self-isolation from an official residence outside Paris, "is still presenting the same symptoms of the Covid-19 illness (fatigue, coughing, stiffness)", said a brief statement on Saturday, signed by his doctor.
 But they were not preventing him from carrying out his duties and he was in stable condition.
 "We have to be vigilant as the virus is gaining in strength again," the French leader said on Friday in a short video message.
 In Australia, a cluster of cases on Sydney's northern beaches grew to 38, with residents ordered to stay home from late Saturday other than for essential reasons.
 New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian pleaded with Sydney's more than five million residents to remain in their homes.
 "We're hoping that will give us sufficient time to get on top of the virus so that we can then ease up for Christmas and the New Year," she said.
 In India the total number of cases moved past 10 million on Saturday, the second highest in the world, although new infection rates appear to have fallen sharply in recent weeks.

 Huffman, who has been working in the health and wellness business for 20 years, has been down this road before.
 Huffman got his start in 2002 running the GNC store in the Imperial Mall. Over the years, he started owning and operating the Grand Island and Kearney GNC stores, as well.
 As the Imperial Mall went through some ownership changes before eventually closing, he was forced to find another location in Hastings.
 “We moved out of there and actually packed up the entire store and moved everything in my garage and basement for a month before we found a place to land,” Huffman said.
 After the corporate decision in March to close his three stores, he said many of his customers in Hastings urged him to find a way to still provide his services.

“We really believe in small independent films, in this area. We don’t plan on moving to Hollyawood. We like finding the little gems out here. We’re always going to support those and find projects to hop on board,” Savino said. “In a lot of ways, as rough as this year was, in terms of a year to sit down to do the legwork to start an entertainment business, this was probably it.
 “None of this would have happened if I was still working food service half the week,” Savino said of the change in his life due to the pandemic.
 He said the filming of “The Cran,” which was done in Wood County, allowed him and his partner, Marlee Carpenter, to sidestep some of the common pitfalls inherent in the independent movie industry.
 “It’s to the point where I wouldn’t say we’re the biggest fish in the Ohio indy-film pond, but we’re not going to get eaten by the biggest fish. It’s to the extent that if we were to suddenly pack up and move to a big city, then that’s all the lightning taken out of the bottle,” Savino said of his Bowling Green base.
 “The Cran” is exiting post-production this year.
 The second film, “Eviscerate Me!,” is currently filming and being directed by Elijah Lothamer, who worked on “The Cran.” Lothamer recently signed on to the production team at Bucketnaut.
 Savino’s third project is his second full-length movie to direct, called “Refrigerator.” It will start filming in 2022.
 “The Cran” has exceeded Savino’s expectations. The film was made for only $20,000. Meanwhile, he said industry response has pegged it at the $750,000 category.
 Release is planned for early 2021.
 “No matter how good the final product ends up being, you can always look at it and say, ‘If I had only had one more day of shooting,’ or that I wasn’t going to use that scene and fill it with something else, that’s the part that’s really exciting, taking everything I learned from this and applying it to the next one,” Savino said.

INDIANAPOLIS – On November 23rd, 2020, the Indiana State Police held an awards and recognition ceremony in Indianapolis. The ceremony publicly recognized the accomplishments and sacrifices of the Indiana State Police employees from around the state. Three local troopers and the Attica police chief were recognized at the ceremony.
 Trooper Daniel Connolly was recognized as the 2019 Indiana State Police Lafayette Post Trooper of the District. The award is given annually to the trooper that personifies integrity, professionalism, and a well-rounded work ethic. Connolly was selected by the command staff at the Lafayette Post for his dedication to his job, traffic and criminal enforcement, community involvement, instructor ratings, specialty assignments, and other services provided by the officer that exceed department expectations. In 2019, Connolly had 239 criminal arrests, investigated over 200 criminal cases, worked 57 crashes, answered 323 calls for service, and initiated 1,230 traffic stops. Connolly has worked for the Indiana State Police for 3 years.
 Connolly also received the Indiana State Police Lafayette District Driving Under the Influence (DUI) Award for his commitment to removing impaired drivers from the Indiana roadways. In 2019, Connolly led the Lafayette Post with 43 impaired driver arrests. Connolly exemplifies the professionalism and integrity expected of Indiana State Police troopers. Connolly’s actions continue to make the roadways safer for the citizens of Indiana.

From “The Cran” emerged “Refrigerator,” which will also star Carpenter.
 It’s about a missing person’s case where she plays a small-town Florida sheriff’s deputy that pieces the story together.
 “I’m somebody that likes to play a lot of different roles. I wanted to play something that’s just as layered and juicy as Hannah, from ‘The Cran,’ but isn’t Hannah,” said Carpenter.
 Savino has done more than take the lessons of film-making to heart. He has also taken some of his fellow students into the Bucketnaut fold, expanding his Bowling Green links.
 “You meet your best film-making compatriots in film-making school. So, yeah, we made some good connections,” Savino said.
 Savino caught a bit of luck in filming “The Cran” in that filming wrapped up just before the stay-at-home orders were mandated.
 “Once things really started tightening up at home, I was deep in the edit,” Savino said. “Stay home? Oh no! What am I going to do, stay home, edit and be productive?”
 He will be staying home for the holidays to finish editing and prepare for screenings.
 “Once we have something we’re happy with, we start sending it out to film festivals. There’s the bigger ones, like Sundance and South by Southwest, that are harder to get into, but have a better chance of getting noticed by larger companies,” Savino said. “Then there are smaller ones, like state-wide festivals or even community-wide film festivals that maybe don’t carry the same weight as something like Sundance, but allows you to kind of build up your resume.”
 Any awards the film might receive will then help to propel it to the next level festival. 4x3 Productions would then push it into a theatrical run, unless it gets picked up by a bigger distributor.
 “If festivals are virtual, then they are virtual. It will save some travel money. Hopefully by summer people will be antsy to see a movie,” Savino said.
 Bucketnaut will have an official production company launch on Feb. 1, which will include new film trailers and project profiles.
 More information can be found on the website https://www.bucketnaut.com/, but Savino also recommends that fans continue to pay attention around town for film crews and larger-than-life events that look like they might be part of a movie.

For almost the past decade, Mariane Ibrahim has been cultivating an audience for African contemporary art. Starting from a base in Seattle, it was a lonely beginning, but over the years, changing perceptions and a relocation of her gallery to Chicago brought about dramatic and positive change.  Representing 16 artists of African heritage, Ibrahim, who was born to Somali parents in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia, has a keen eye for detecting new talent. She often discovers artists on Instagram; some she finds on her travels. One aspect of Chicago that Ibrahim particularly appreciates is the new network of collectors. “The Black collectors have emerged, and they are changing the game,” she says. “They have a legitimacy in hanging the work in their homes. Blackness is not just a color—it’s a history and a lifestyle. The Black collectors from all over the world want to have a piece of the pie. Not to be at the very end, but early on, when the artist is about to make it out there to the public.”      SOURCE: W MAGAZINE

Though states have spent millions more this fall as COVID-19 cases surged again, the initial PPE spending panic has subsided as production increased and supply chains improved.
 California spent the most during the pandemic's initial months -- at least $1.5 billion in the AP's data -- followed by Texas, Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington. New York also spent several hundred million dollars on PPE and ventilators through November, though it's unclear how much of that occurred in the spring.
 New Jersey and New York provided total figures but not specific details about their purchases. New Jersey's health department said it would be too "disruptive" to agency operations to do so, and New York repeatedly postponed a response.
 The AP's data shows that millions of dollars flowed from states to businesses that had never before sold PPE, including a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, an American tribal organization and consultants with international connections. Traditional safety equipment suppliers also saw a surge in PPE sales, offsetting their losses from other products amid the sudden recession.
 But the states' burst of spending wasn't a boon for everyone. Some businesses that tried to supply PPE lost millions of dollars when states canceled orders that failed to meet aggressive delivery deadlines or strict product specifications. Businesses selling PPE faced a treacherous market, with backlogs at foreign manufacturers, shipping delays and multiple intermediaries.
 All of that led to a spike in prices paid by the states, costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
 Before the pandemic, an N95 mask that filters out tiny particles might have cost about 50 cents. This spring, states paid an average of $3 each, according to the AP's analysis. Some states paid more than $10 a mask to get them quickly. Average prices for gloves rose fourfold.
 In mid-March, Louisiana paid $57,450 for 5,000 N95 masks -- at $11.49 each -- from Grey Wolf Safety Group in Broussard. Grey Wolf owner Sean McClellan said that to fulfill the state's order, he had to buy out whatever his competitors had in stock. Some masks he got were designed for painting, others for welding. Some came with special breathing valves, while others did not.
 "All the cheap masks that were N95, those were already gone," McClellan said. "So I basically bought up the expensive ones that were left."
 Then he marked up the price a bit more and resold them to the state, making a couple of dollars per mask.
 "I'm not price-gouging," McClellan said. "I have to make something, and I then have to pay my salesperson something."
 Other businesses that charged high prices to states offered similar explanations. Go Green Solutions Inc. in South Grafton, Massachusetts, sold its home state several thousand N95 masks in early April for $11.25 to $11.50 each. The price was a product of limited supply and high demand, resulting in only modest profit margins, manager Jim Fisher said.
 "Usually, if you found inventory with some of your suppliers, you had to make a purchase right then and there. You couldn't wait," he said, "because within an hour, it would be gone."
 States competed with each other, hospital systems, the federal government and even other countries to find and buy medical gear as the virus began spreading.
 The pressure to obtain protective supplies led some states to unusual sources. Minnesota bought 2,300 waterproof gowns intended for milking cows from Udder Tech Inc. The special gowns cost about $46 each when freight was included -- about seven times the average price that states were paying for medical gowns this spring. Before the pandemic, some health care systems could buy disposable gowns for about 40 cents each.
 "They were looking to acquire anything they could at that point to help protect the health care workers," said Dana Casto, business manager at the Rosemount, Minnesota-based dairy supply company.
 While some states paid a premium for small orders from local suppliers, their purchasing agents also scrambled to secure large quantities of protective equipment, much of it manufactured in Asia. That created an opportunity for companies to enter the PPE field.
 The largest supplier of PPE to states this spring had never sold a single mask before the pandemic. But from mid-March to early June, Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD sold $930 million worth of masks and sanitizer to states. Two-thirds of that went to California, where Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom drew criticism for initially keeping secret the details of his "bold and big" deal that paid BYD $3.30 for each N95.
 Like the leaders of some other states, Newsom sidestepped the traditional purchasing process of publicly soliciting competitive bids from vendors, which can take weeks or even months. Some state lawmakers responsible for budgeting complained that Newsom left them out of the loop.
 Washington, which was among the first states to record coronavirus cases, bought tens of millions of N95 masks and similar KN95 masks from BYD this spring at prices ranging from $2.58 to $4.02 each. That helped rank Washington among the top states in mask purchasing rates per COVID-19 cases among its residents, according to the AP's analysis.
 BYD also sold to Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas this spring and signed an additional $316 million deal with California in July, after the period covered by the AP's data. By then, the price the company charged to California had fallen to $2.13 per N95 mask and 20 cents per surgical mask, barely a third of the spring rate.
 During the first quarter of 2020, when China was in lockdown, BYD reported a 35% decline in operating income. That's when company Chairman Wang Chuanfu decided to begin making masks and sanitizer. BYD's income rebounded to post a 12% gain through the first three-quarters of the year. Its stock price surged from $5 a share in January to more than $20 this fall, although it's unclear how much of that is attributable to new PPE production versus its sales of electric vehicles and other products.
 Frank Girardot, senior communications director for BYD North America, compared Chuanfu to an inventor "along the lines of Thomas Edison" who got into the PPE business for altruistic reasons.
 "He, in January, decided that this was something that the company had to do in service to the world," Girardot said.
 BYD's largest U.S. investor is Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett.
 Fastenal Co. and W.W. Grainger, two industrial suppliers, also saw surges in PPE sales. The AP's data includes $99 million in PPE sales to 32 states by Fastenal, and $50 million in PPE sales to 40 states by Grainger, which said its profits on those sales were squeezed by increased freight costs and previous contracts with reduced prices.
 Many of the companies in the AP's data set are not publicly traded and thus can keep their financial figures private. For example, one of the largest deals is California's $179 million order of 20 million gowns from BuKo LLC. The New York-based company has a bare-bones website that describes it as "a brand and product development think tank." Few other details are available about the company.
 BuKo owner Rashmi Budhram declined to comment when reached by telephone.
 Others, however, were more than willing to describe how PPE sales provided a lifeline at the onset of the pandemic.
 The leaders at Grand Traverse Economic Development, a commercial investment entity for the Ottawa and Chippewa Native American tribes in Michigan, decided to get into the PPE business when a shutdown affected the tribe's other business ventures. The organization quickly became New Hampshire's top PPE supplier, selling the state nearly $28 million worth of masks, gowns, coveralls, face shields and sanitizing wipes this spring. It made a profit of around 10% to 15%, business development director Lauren Tucker said.
 "This helped us keep our doors open, keep our staff fully employed and engaged, and we grew during the pandemic," she said.
 Bellia, president of Body Armor Outlet, also expanded. The AP's data for the spring includes just over $50 million in PPE sales to states by the Salem, New Hampshire, company. But Bellia said his total PPE sales this year are around $120 million -- a roughly thirtyfold increase over his company's total sales for 2019.
 Because of the success, Bellia increased his payroll from eight to 12 employees. And while he continues to sell body armor, he cleared almost all of it out of his warehouse to make room for coronavirus PPE.
 "While in a heartbeat I would trade this to go back to the way it was, I think unequivocally it's been a great thing for us," he said.
