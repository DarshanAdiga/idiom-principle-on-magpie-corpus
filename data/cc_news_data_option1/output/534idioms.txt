The point is not that straight men should not be allowed to fantasize or that all the male gaze laden comic book films of yore -- and all those undoubtedly yet to come -- should be burned in ceremonial pyres. The "Daddy's Lil Monster" shirt makes a cameo in  _Birds of Prey_ ; Harley insists on keeping it. For sentimental reasons, she says. That shirt and all it represents do not need to be destroyed. It can be kept and even recalled fondly. The point is that there needs to be room at the table for everybody else. The superhero genre has privileged one specific gaze for a long time, but these stories appeal to and owe their success to audiences spanning every demographic under the sun, and that deserves to be better reflected in who gets to tell them.

That left a lot of room for programming on traditional TV to thrive -- _The Big Bang Theory_ , for instance, averaged better than 23 million viewers that season -- and awards shows were at the leading edge.

The single most telling example of  _Birds of Prey_ 's consideration on this front boils down to a tale of two shirts. In  _Suicide Squad_ , Harley Quinn's main look features a red-accented baseball tee with "Daddy's Lil Monster" stamped across the chest. The shirt debuts in a long leer across Harley's body as she strips down in front of an overwhelmingly male crowd in order to put on the item of clothing; an outfit and a performance designed with the fantasies of a specific sort of viewer in mind, first and foremost, as opposed to the character actually wearing it. Harley's basic aesthetic in  _Birds of Prey _is consistent--shorts, t-shirts, heavy makeup--but the details and the subtext of director Cathy Yan's installment could not be more different than _Suicide Squad_ filmmaker David Ayer's. For most of the film Harley wears a loose-fitting t-shirt patterned with her own name--all caps, bolded font. She is her own.

Sparkling hundreds from Babar Azam and Shan Masood put Pakistan in command against Bangladesh on the second day of the first Test in Rawalpindi on Saturday. Azam scored a career best unbeaten 143 for his third successive hundred in as many Tests -- fifth of a burgeoning career -- while opener Shan Masood made 100 as they pulverised a hapless Bangladesh attack at Rawalpindi stadium. At close, Azam was still batting with Asad Shafiq on 60, piling agony on the visitors during their unbroken 137-run stand for the fourth wicket.
 Masood said he and Azam have done their jobs.
 "We have batted our way to take the team in a strong position and hope that the remaining batsmen come and score so that we can build a good lead," said Masood, who hailed Azam as world class.
 "When Babar was coming out to bat the crowd chanted 'Babar, Babar' and that is the sign of a great batsman who is so popular."
 Pakistan lead Bangladesh's first innings total of 233 by 109 runs with six wickets intact.
 Since his fighting century against Australia at Brisbane (104) in November last year, Azam has notched 102 not out and 100 not out against Sri Lanka in two Tests -- making this his fourth hundred in five Tests.
 In between he missed a hundred at Adelaide by a mere three runs.
 Azam steered spinner Taijul Islam to short third man boundary for his 15th four to complete three-figure mark off just 134 balls.
 He has so far batted for 276 minutes, smashing 18 boundaries and a six. His previous best score was 127 against New Zealand in Dubai in November 2018.
 Shafiq also batted with confidence, having so far hit eight boundaries in his 111-ball knock.
 But it could have been an early exit for Azam had Ebadot Hossain not dropped him off Islam at long-off when his score was only two.
 That lapse cost Bangladesh dearly as Azam added an invaluable 112 for the third wicket with Masood, who also knocked his third Test century -- second in successive Tests.
 Masood -- who was finally bowled out by Islam -- reached his hundred by hooking pacer Rubel Hossain for his 12th boundary. He reached three figures off 157 balls in 226 minutes of batting.
 Islam (1-111) toiled hard as he bowled 27 overs on the trot since start. The only other successful bowler was paceman Abu Jayed whose figure read 2-66.
 When Pakistan started their innings in the morning all focus was on Abid, who scored two hundreds in his first two Tests against Sri Lanka in December last year.
 Another hundred would have equalled Indian player Mohammad Azharuddin's unique record -- three successive centuries in his first three Tests -- but Abid fell far short when he was dismissed without scoring.
 He edged a short and wide delivery from Jayed into the hands of wicketkeeper Liton Das and trudged off to the pavilion heartbroken.
 Azhar added 91 runs for the second wicket with Masood and looked set for a big score until he miscued a drive off Jayed and was caught by Najmul Hossain Shanto in the slip.
 Azhar's attractive 34 included four boundaries.

The T20 World Cup will be held in Australia from October and the Indian team is not playing many ODIs this year. After the ongoing series against New Zealand, India will compete against South Africa in a three-match ODI series, which will be its last in 2020.
 The international teams are also fighting hard to earn points for the World Test Championship, which will be decided by June 2021. The India skipper said despite defeat, they have got some positives too from the lost series and they can make changes to the playing XI for the third match.
 "This was a game where we could have taken chances and capitalised. We didn't know Saini can be as good with the bat. We want guys to figure out situations themselves. We could definitely consider changes, we have nothing to lose now."
 Man-of-the-match Kyle Jamieson, who scored crucial 25 runs while batting at number 11 and took two wickets, was overwhelmed by the win.
 "Bit of a high at the moment. Still kind of sinking it. The game kind of ebbed and flowed. It was pretty simple: we were just trying to get it through 50 overs. Just trying and stick with Ross (Taylor)," he said.
 "Relief was the feeling to get the first wicket out of the way and not give too many runs. International cricket is quite high intensity, but it was pretty cool."
 New Zealand opener wicket-keeper batsman Tom Latham hailed it as a "great victory".
 "Last game the batters won the game, today the bowlers did the job. I think that total was okay, it was a funny wicket. We managed to take wickets upfront and the bowlers kept taking wickets. We've had some close games with India, delighted to get the win," he said.
 "Kyle on debut was fantastic. Delighted for him. It'll be great to win 3-nil from here. Fingers crossed, and hopefully we keep learning."

It is my place to thank Him and use His gifts in service to Him.
 The Lord gave me for several years three very great friends. These men inspired me, taught me and loved me as their brother. All three are now with the Lord, but I still profit from their advice and friendship. They live on in my mind and affections. The Lord provided me a faithful wife of now 51 years and two lovely children. He also gave me two sweet and beautiful grandchildren. These are things a man cannot buy or ever deserve.

That's what commissions are for: To dig deeper into the details than legislators have time to do in the press of a legislative session. The commission can bring additional information and advice back to the Legislature. Arguably this is exactly what was anticipated in in the passage of House Bill 2017. It specifically mandated a legislative check-in on complicated, controversial and expensive mega-projects like the Rose Quarter Freeway widening. In addition, there's another legislative mandate, one that predates the authorization for this project, which calls for the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050; that counts as legislative direction as well. And when legislative mandates are in conflict, and when new information becomes available, its incumbent on commissioners to advise the Legislature accordingly, and not blindly follow out-dated, un-wise and contradictory orders.

The rate of increase in new cases of the virus in China rose again after a short interruption, as the death toll on the mainland rose to 772 and countries around the world enforce stricter measures to limit its spread. An American died of the virus in Wuhan, the city in the center of the outbreak, in what apparently was the first American death. The US Embassy in Beijing said a 60-year-old US citizen diagnosed with the virus died at Jinyintian Hospital in Wuhan on Wednesday. The embassy has not identified the person. A Japanese citizen being treated in Wuhan who has had a suspected case has also died. Nearly all new fatalities fell in and around Wuhan in the central province of Hubei. Another 3,399 cases were reported, bringing the total to 34,546, although some have been recovered. More than 320 cases have been confirmed outside of mainland China, including two deaths in Hong Kong and the Philippines. The virus was diagnosed in three other cruise ship passengers in Japan for a total of 64 on board the ship. The ruling Communist Party of China faces constant anger and blame from the public for the death of a doctor threatened by the police after trying to sound an alarm about the disease more than a month ago.
