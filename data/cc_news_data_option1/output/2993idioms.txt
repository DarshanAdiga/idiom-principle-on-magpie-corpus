Each of the non-GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the company’s results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the company’s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in our industry. The company may also change the calculation of any of the non- GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information from time to time in light of its then existing operations to include other adjustments that may impact its operations.

During these difficult times, as boring as it may sound, that’s the one thing I’m looking forward to: speaking to a therapist. The longer lockdown goes on, the more difficult it becomes to cope without my family, without regularly going outside and seeing them. Everything is stressful and I’m grateful that I get to have a therapist. – _Karabo Mafolo_

Même si Louis Johnson n'avait fait que composer l'iconique ligne de basse de « Billie Jean », il mériterait quand même de faire partie de ce Top 50. Bassiste de session fétiche de Quincy Jones, il a participé à l'enregistrement de plus d'un hit dans les années 70 et 80. Grand technicien, on peut par exemple noter la légèreté de son jeu sur « Off the Wall »… non sans oublier qu'il savait aussi méchamment frapper ses cordes. Impressionnant sur “I Keep Forgettin’ (Every Time You’re Near) » de Michael McDonald, sa rapidité inspirera de nombreux producteurs hip hop.

Commerce Drive is one of the busiest thoroughfares in the city, said City Administrator John Harrenstein. The city decided to go beyond needed pavement and utility line repairs to make the corridor more inviting for motorists and pedestrians alike.
 The city also consolidated business access points, improved sidewalks, replaced and added lighting, installed a monument sign and made other improvements. Federal and state grants paid for roughly two-thirds of the $3.5 million project.
 North Mankato City Engineer Nate Host said the project is nearly complete. A few benches, water fountains and some landscaping are all that remains — as well as turning on the water fountain.
 Janesville-Waldorf-Pemberton High School teachers Aidan Demarias and Tim James teamed up again to create the fountain’s centerpiece.
 The abstract piece titled “Aspire” represents the pursuit of dreams and the “unique pathway” each person takes to finding their success, James said.
 The welded designs that decorate the 11-foot-tall steel structure are mostly abstract. But viewers who examine the designs closely can spot one reference to current events.
 Demarias said the tall, twisting piece of art appears to defy gravity.
 “We want people to question how in the world it is staying up there,” he said.

Richard Davis a eu une carrière particulièrement riche dans les années 60. Participant à l'enregistrement de morceaux parmi les plus exigeants de la décennie, il a su faire vibrer aussi bien le jazzy « Out to Lunch! » d'Eric Dolphy que le très folk « Astral Weeks » de Van Morrison. Musicien de session de luxe, il a également apporté son savoir-faire à des géants tels que Sarah Vaughan, Paul Simon et Igor Stravinsky. Mais c'est dans l'ombre que Davis se sent véritablement chez lui. Et s'il rythme les mots de Springsteen sur « Meeting Across the River » avec brio, « Astral Weeks » reste le joyaux de sa carrière. « _C 'était lui l'âme de l'album_, » se souvient son producteur, Lewis Merenstein.

Another point is that vaccines and immune systems are tricky. No vaccine and no antibody provides 100% immunity. We've all heard people say:" I got the flu shot this year, and I still got the flu, so it's worthless". Not true. It is far from worthless. Take last year's influenza season. The vaccine was overall only 45% effective (although in the vulnerable age group of kids up to age 17, effectiveness was 55%). That means that the incidence of infected patients was 45% of those who would have been infected in a totally unvaccinated US population; but 55% still got infected. However, the vaccination WAS worth it. Anyone who got the shot and still got infected, usually had a much less severe case. The person who might have died of influenza might have been hospitalized, but he/she by and large, survived- maybe even with only a simple fever and cough, staying at home.

"There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the restrictions," Jason Schram, mayor of Colac, which is covered by the new Geelong restrictions, told Melbourne Radio 3AW.
 "It just seems like they've done this to say: `We're doing something in these regional area hot spots,"' he added.
 Iatrou, who owns a Melbourne cafe, says city residents have become much more reticent to go out to buy a takeaway coffee as the infection numbers climb.
 "It's surprising, it's eye-opening and it's quite scary if we can't get a handle on it," she said. "At the moment, the numbers sound big to us because we haven't had to deal with the numbers that a lot of countries in the world have had to deal with."

In the Shema, everything is reversed. God is no longer the God of Creation, and later the God of a chosen people, B'nei Yisrael, but rather, Shema is trailblazing and extraordinarily novel, establishing the starting point of "Hashem Elokeinu" \- "the Lord, our God, God of B'nei Yisrael" \- and the endpoint of "Hashem Echad" \- God's exclusive Oneness and authority over all, by dint of His being Hashem Elokeinu, God of the Jewish People. This means that that solely through B'nei Yisrael will Hashem's reign as God of the universe and all existence be manifest. (This is intimated by Rashi .) Hashem Elokeinu comes first in Shema, as it is the foundation of everything.
