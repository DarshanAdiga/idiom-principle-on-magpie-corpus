Some colloquially say that the forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest. Seeing this feline enjoy the forbidden carpeted hallway floor blissfully may make you believe in the validity of that phrase.Shared on Reddit on June 21, the clip has been descriptively captioned, "He's not allowed to go past the front door often, but when he hears the doorbell to our apartment ring he takes full advantage of the 30 seconds he knows he'll get in the glorious hallway if he sneaks by me". The recording captures a feline rubbing its body on the carpeted floor of a hallway. The camera person, then, zooms into the action, so the kitty's movements are clear to the viewers. To say it is enjoying the carpet would be an understatement. The cat rolls its body repeatedly on the floor, sniffing the matting so intensely that it almost appears as if it is kissing it. The film ends with the feline lying on top of its one true love, the carpeted hallway floor. Why is this cat so obsessed with the hallway floor? Is it because it is forbidden from going out there? Were they star crossed lovers in another life? Watch the video and decide. He's not allowed to go past the front door often, but when he hears the doorbell to our apartment ring he takes full advantage of the 30 seconds he knows he'll get in the ~glorious~ hallway if he sneaks by me from r/AnimalsBeingDerpsSince being shared to the subreddit 'animals being derps', the post has amassed over 3,100 upvotes and many funny comments.

There are no plans to consolidate polling locations in November. Benson said, however, that polling places may only be able to handle half their regular volume due to social-distancing and safety requirements.
 “We want to have that same physical option and then enough other options in place to essentially reduce the number of people who might choose that in- person option. You have less crowding on Election Day, less lines on Election Day as result and more people voting by mail,” said Benson, who is pushing the Republican-led Legislature to pass a bill to let clerks start processing absentee ballots the day before Election Day. The actual ballots would still stay inside secrecy envelopes until counting on Election Day.
 She said the structuring of in-person voting will depend on data collected in the months ahead showing how many people request absentee ballots.
 Benson recently announced she will participate in listening sessions in places with low turnout historically — precincts in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Flint, for instance. She said she is concerned that voting issues in other parts of the U.S. have sent a message to people of color and historically disenfranchised communities “that it’s going to be extra hard and unsafe for you to vote this year when the reality is anything but.”
 Voter outreach must be “more than just about a voter registration drive or inspiring people to vote or cutting through perhaps apathy,” Benson said. “It’s really about delivering educational information about the nuts and bolts of how you vote and what your rights are. I think we’ll see a lot of messaging transition into a how-to-vote as opposed to a you’ve-got-to-vote message. I think a lot of people know they’ve got a vote and now it’s really a question of how.”

Marilyn Shope Peterson      On June 3rd, surrounded by family, Marilyn Shope Peterson passed away peacefully at her home in Anacortes, WA. She was a kind, loving mother, pioneer in business and science, world traveler, accomplished author and mentor.      Born September 17, 1935 in Hamilton, Montana, first child of Edward & Ethel Shope, she was raised in Missoula where she graduated from Missoula County High School, and spent happy summers at Seeley Lake. She earned a degree in Home Economics from the University of Montana, the foundation for her career in Nutrition, and was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, the 1954 Homecoming Queen, and met husband Keith D. Peterson. She explored post-war Europe during this time, connecting with relatives there.      In 1963, she and Keith founded The Sports Medicine Clinic in Ballard, one of the pre-eminent Sports Medicine institutions, and the 1st privately owned clinic in the US, providing medical support for athletes from youth to professional; her tireless efforts at SMC contributed to its prosperity and growth. She earned a Masters in Nutrition at the University of Washington, and authored two books on sports nutrition; The Athlete's Cookbook and Eat to Compete. Her nutritional expertise attracted the US Olympic Team, the Pacific NW Ballet, and many professional athletes with whom she consulted.      In 1990 she returned to MT and founded the Emily A Bed & Breakfast, a lodge nestled between the Swan and Mission mountain ranges, named for her grandmother. This beautiful log home became a destination point in western MT, where she hosted many local artisan and community groups, supported local activities and was active in her church.      After 15 years, Keith & Marilyn retired to Phoenix, AZ and became active seasonal residents. She dedicated her time and love of Western art working as a docent at the Phoenix Art Museum, but returned home to the mountains of MT each summer.

Many pieces at the leading auction houses bear the pedigree of a Graff, Buccellati, Chopard or Harry Winston. Indeed, when Christie’s held its last jewel auction in late April, almost all of the first 25 pieces listed were from brand name designers: Bulgari, Van Cleef & Arpels and Graff, among others.
 That approach may offer buyers a feeling of security that they are getting a pedigreed piece. Until now, in fact, the highest priced jewel sold at Christie’s online was a pair of ruby and diamond Graff hoop earrings that went for $187,000. But the earrings had been available to see live before the auction.
 To make quarantined bidders more comfortable with pieces that they cannot see in person, auction houses are providing more guidance on the phone and online, with private Zoom viewings for major pieces and striving to make the online action livelier.
 Summerfield said that Doyle used a live auctioneer at its two May online sales. Working in a closed space, a camera followed the auctioneer as she recognized bids placed by Doyle employees on behalf of clients.
 To hold the attention of bidders, the auction house, which formerly assembled as many as 500 lots for an auction, has cut that number in half. “It was too many lots,” Summerfield said. “Now we are doing fewer lots and having more frequent auctions.”
 Jewelry lovers are quickly adapting to not just bidding online, but also doing so without having seen the goods in the flesh.
 Ellen Safir, who manages money for endowments and pensions, just bought a pair of diamond and platinum clip earrings in an online auction at Freeman’s, the Philadelphia auction house. She has already bought objects she has not seen in person, including an Art Deco-style bracelet from 1stdibs, the online marketplace.
 “A jewelry auction is similar to the auction of any other high-priced thing,” said Safir, who is in her 70s. “The auction houses do a lot more than just having you click. They have Zoom meetings, and you get condition reports.”
 A Beverly Hills doctor who requested anonymity because she is concerned about discussing jewelry in the current environment, said she has been buying online since eBay and continues to shop. She feels she is familiar enough with brands to know how to look for great copies of pieces even by designers like Bulgari. Recently she bought a pair of earrings from Doyle for $8,000 that were in the style of Van Cleef & Arpels.
 “In California we like you to think we don’t get dressed up,” she said. “But we wear jewelry to the gas station with our Lululemons.”
 And some women are savvy comparative shoppers. When Donna Adams, a 48-year-old architectural designer, saw an elegant Chopard gold bangle watch that had been up for auction at Doyle, she knew she wanted it.
 As Adams recalled it, she had seen the watch for sale on eBay for about $11,000 “You can’t just find that watch anywhere,” she said. “It is vintage. You can’t just go to a neighborhood jewelry store and look for it.”
 Never mind that she would have no chance to see the watch. It had been put up for auction with a $2,000 to $3,000 estimate and had not sold. Adams quickly called the auction house and bought it for $3,400, including the buyer’s premium.

He abandoned the deal on the car. A week later, he moved all his money out of Wells Fargo and then hired Rodal, who had gained a reputation for representing black customers against the bank after the story of one of his clients went viral in 2018. Rodal sent Wells Fargo a letter, but negotiations stalled.
 Bennett decided to share his story publicly in light of the recent protests: “I don’t want anybody else to go through what I went through.”
 Eshet, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said that branch employees were trained to spot potential fraud and that the bank had increased security protocols to thwart internet scams involving large transfers of money.
 “In this instance, there were enough markers for our team to conduct extra diligence in order to protect the customer and the bank,” she said.
 The protests also pushed Benndrick Watson into action.
 Last spring, Watson was driven out of a Wells Fargo branch in Westchase, a wealthy neighborhood near Tampa, Florida, by what the branch manager described as a “slip of the tongue.”
 Watson, who was already a bank customer with a personal checking account, went to the branch to open a business account for his law firm.
 A banker did a corporate records search and found Watson’s other business, a record label. Watson tried to direct the employee to the records for his law firm instead.
 Eventually, the branch manager got involved. He sat down across from Watson and watched him enter information, including his Social Security number, into a keypad.
 Then, the man uttered the N-word.
 “He just said it — clear as day, no mistake,” Watson said. “My jaw just dropped. I dropped the pen. There was silence. He kind of looked at me. I said, ‘Did you really just say that?’”
 Watson said the man had immediately begun to protest, saying that he had not meant to use the word and that he was deeply sorry. Watson did not buy it. He got up and left. The manager followed him to his car, apologizing profusely, and resigned from the bank shortly afterward.
 “I felt like I had a knife in my gut,” Watson said. “It’s a sickening word.”
 Watson turned to Rodal, who wrote to Wells Fargo seeking an apology. The bank’s regional president, Steve Schultz, responded. “It seems that the utterance of the offensive term was unintentional,” Schultz wrote, but said the bank had taken “corrective action” against the branch manager anyway, without providing details. Eshet of Wells Fargo said the manager was deemed ineligible for any job with the bank.
 Watson sued Wells Fargo in federal court in Florida on June 4.
 In a statement, Eshet said, “We deeply apologize to Mr. Watson. There’s no excuse for it, and while we took action to address the matter, it cannot undo what happened and how he felt. We are very sorry.”
 The problem is hardly confined to Wells Fargo. Last June, Robyn Murphy, a public relations consultant in Maryland, took her 18-year-old son, Jason, to a Bank of America branch in Owings Mills, Maryland, to open a joint savings account. Murphy, a 20-year customer of the bank, said she was shocked when an employee refused to proceed after a computer program flagged her son’s Social Security number as fraudulent.

Ken married Julie Li in 1968, and raised two children, Ayesha and Derek. He received his Master's in Urban Planning from Virginia Tech in 1964, and retired in 2001 as Director of International Marketing for the Port of Seattle.Ken was born in 1935 to Zhang Fen Pai, a refined Southern lady from Zhejiang Province, and Chien Min Pai, a central government official and liaison to China's Northwest frontier. As a boy, Ken survived illness, Japanese occupation, and the death of his mother, eventually discovering his iconoclastic spirit while fighting for opportunities to go to school amidst the Chinese Civil War. After majoring in Foreign Languages and English Literature at the National Taiwan University and completing two years of compulsory military service, Ken decided to pursue the American dream in 1961, eventually landing in Blacksburg, Virginia to the tune of "Dixie". At Virginia Tech, and later at Columbia and Harvard, he studied urban planning and began a career of public service as the field evolved from anti-poverty programs to urban renewal to economic redevelopment in cities like Norwalk, New York, and Hoboken. His contributions to the "Model Cities" program helped attract a new generation of residents, businesses, and artists to Hoboken. He met Julie at Columbia University in 1965. In 1980, along with their two young children, Ken and Julie moved to Seattle where Ken worked at the Port of Seattle until his retirement in 2001 as Director of International Marketing. He began there as a Planner for shipping terminal property. With the normalization of US-China diplomacy, Ken turned his focus to Asia as it grew to become the Port's primary market. He was instrumental in establishing and maintaining relationships with Chinese governmental and industry leaders, and played a key role in bringing major airline and shipping line business to Seattle. He later created a partnership between the Port, Seattle's Chamber of Commerce and the local business community, and in 1990 co-founded the Seattle Trade Development Alliance, now part of Greater Seattle Partners.Ken had a lifelong passion for learning and for building bridges where none had existed before. Fluent in American and Chinese cultural norms, he made friends so easily that one could forgive his thunderous sneezes and off-kilter baseball caps. Informed by decades of experience with both frontiers and obstacles, Ken was a teacher and mentor to many. He is survived by his wife Julie, daughter Ayesha (m. Armando), son Derek, granddaughters Marisa and Bella, and three siblings. Due to current social distancing guidelines, a memorial service is not planned at this time. Donations in Ken's honor may be made to the US-China Strong Foundation (100kstrong.org) and to the Parkinson's Foundation (parkinson.org)

It was like the tightening of a vice,” says Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever’s Fran Keaney, of the encroaching lockdown measures that have put his band’s touring adventures on ice. When the Australian government’s ban on gatherings of more than 500 people meant RBCF’s show with Pixies at the Sydney Opera House in March was abruptly cancelled, they played a tiny show of their own in Sydney. “But somehow 700 people turned up,” the singer and guitarist says. “It had a strange ‘last show on Earth’ vibe – it felt really wrong. And then everything stopped. I went from worrying that Covid-19 might complicate our UK tour to wondering if I’m allowed to visit my girlfriend down the road.”

S. Kenneth Pai      On Monday, May 25, 2020, S. Kenneth Pai, loving husband, father, and grandfather, passed away one week before his 85th birthday. Ken married Julie Li in 1968, and raised two children, Ayesha and Derek. He received his Master's in Urban Planning from Virginia Tech in 1964, and retired in 2001 as Director of International Marketing for the Port of Seattle.

This suggests that leverage is no real issue, with leverage pegged at 2.2 times EBITDA. Based on EBIT of $1.60 billion, assuming a 4% cost of debt on pro-forma net debt of $4.4 billion, and assuming a 15% tax rate, we can construct a pro-forma P&L of $1.21 billion. Based on a total share count of 595 million shares, I see pro-forma earnings per share just above $2 per share.


  At the offer price of $28, shares trade at just 14 times earnings, hence the reason why shares have seen probably a big jump in their price as other investors feel this multiple is compelling as well.


  Furthermore, the company has seen great momentum in the first quarter with total revenues up 15% to $501 million, for a run rate of $2.0 billion. Reported earnings fell sharply as a result of high provisions for changes in expected cash flows from royalty assets, as this is a volatile P&L item. Given the stable cash flow generation and reasonable leverage ratios, the company is anticipated to pay out dividends of $0.60 per share per annum going forward.


  With sales currently trending at a rate roughly 10% higher than the 2019 numbers, earnings power should improve towards $2.25 per share, for a 21-22 times earnings multiple at $49 per share.


  ## What Now?


  Royalty Pharma is quite an interesting business. I like the business model, growth, leadership position, modest leverage ratio and the compelling valuation at the offer price. Trading just shy of $50 now, pro-forma earnings multiples have expanded to 21-22 times earnings, a full multiple despite the 10% topline sales growth.


  While the company has great diversified operations on paper, the company relies on just 5 product candidates for little half over revenues, although that concentration risk seems manageable. Other risks include, of course, the risks of making wrong acquisitions related to future royalty streams, and the fact that capital allocation is essentially controlled by a unique management contract.


  Nonetheless, I find the business and its business model quite unique and interesting. A big move higher on the opening days has reduced most of the appeal, with shares essentially having seen a boost from a valuation at around 12 times pro-forma earnings at $28 per share, to 21-22 times currently at nearly $50 per share.
