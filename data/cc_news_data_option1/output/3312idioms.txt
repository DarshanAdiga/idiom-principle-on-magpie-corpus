Until there's a definitive answer, the actress has been keeping busy with plenty of activities while in quarantine in her Los Angeles home. She's been regularly exercising; baking treats and delivering some to friends from a safe distance; catching up on books and shows, and filmed an entire movie from her house.
 McNamara is also trying to figure out a way to release original music that's been on her computer for quite some time.
 "I think now's the time sort of going back into my archives and seeing what I had set aside for one reason or another," she said. "I also have a few projects in development that are pretty exciting and a few projects that were about to go but quarantine put them on hold. So there are things that are literally waiting in the wings that I'm ready to jump on a plane as soon as it's deemed safe. "

Managers of businesses with operations abroad would find that about 50 percent of existing international trade invoices, cross-border loans, and international bonds are in U.S. dollars. No other foreign currency would offer access to commercial and financial networks of this size; for as many businesses as before, the U.S. dollar would still be better than the alternatives. Foreign governments and central banks would see businesses within their jurisdictions accumulate this dollar exposure. In light of this exposure, to fulfill their domestic policy objectives, foreign officials would then stockpile U.S. dollars. The dollar’s share of official foreign exchange reserves would have no reason to deviate from the roughly 60 percent level it is at now.

Online registration for the monsoon semester at Jawaharlal Nehru University began on Friday with the university allowing students to take provisional registration in view of the prevailing pandemic. Students have been asked to pay all “relevant” backlog, including tuition fee, hostel fee and mess dues, online and submit no dues certificate after the university opens to regularise their registration.
 The JNU Students’ Union and the JNU Teachers’ Association both called for the postponement of online registration while the students demanded a fee waiver for the lockdown period.
 The JNUTA said it takes strong exception to the JNU administration’s functioning of the university in which formalities like registration and extracting fees through this from students are prioritised over ensuring that the institution’s responsibilities towards their education are discharged to the fullest extent. It added that the ‘provisional’ nature of the registration is a clear acknowledgement that the administration has not yet been able to create the conditions even on paper for completion of the winter semester of 2020-21, let alone a proper completion.
 ## Phased return
 The JNUTA said that it took exception to the fact that the registration requires all students to clear dues and pay the fees for the monsoon semester of 2020-21 even though access to so many of the facilities for which the fees are charged are being denied to students.
 The JNUSU said that no student should be left to uncertainty as online learning has been proved exclusionary and discriminatory and students who have opted for offline/blended mode be given the opportunity to finish their semester requirements through phased return to the campus.
 “Phase-wise return of students should start with prioritising stranded students and those who wish to submit their thesis/dissertation and need to access campus based facilities/resources. This will require the administration to facilitate test facility and isolation centre on campus,” the students said.
 The ABVP also took out a demonstration outside the Dean of Students Welfare office demanding the relaxation of hostel fee and miscellaneous charges during the lockdown up till the reopening of campus and hostel facilities.
 “Many students who had not used the mess facility during the period of lockdown have also been unjustifiably charged with inflated mess bills. Students should not be forced to pay for services that were neither utilised nor rendered to them,” the ABVP said.
 The JNU VC M. Jagadesh Kumar, tweeting a photo of an empty campus road said: “Online registration process of continuing students at JNU has started today [Friday] and is picking up.” He added that the process for registration was convenient and simple, which the students can do from their place of stay. “Let us follow COVID-19 regulations in letter and spirit to keep ourselves and others safe,” he said.

California’s economic recovery slowed markedly last month as COVID-19 infections rose and the state resumed shutting businesses.
 Employers added just 140,400 payroll jobs from mid-June to mid-July to a total workforce of nearly 15.8 million, state officials reported.
 The July job gain was dramatically less than the record 542,500 rise the previous month when restaurants, stores and other businesses briefly reopened amid hopes that the virus was abating.
 California’s unemployment rate lowered to 13.3% last month, down from 14.9% in June, but part of the decline was due to a drop in people looking for work.

Wednesday: Having seen Target and Walmart blitz expectations in their recent numbers, another decent bellwether of the US economy, Williams-Sonoma will announce Q2 results this week. Williams-Sonoma specialises in a range of household cookware, bakeware, and furniture. One of the biggest retailers in this space, the company also owns the Pottery Barn and West Elm brands. In January, Williams-Sonoma shares hit record highs on the back of optimism that it would continue to see consistent gains in operating margins. Since then the US economy has taken a turn for the worse, along with a sharp dip in the share price. The shares have bounced back massively since those March lows, more than doubling, and in so doing have made fresh record highs this month. In Q4 Williams-Sonoma reported double-digit gains in traffic, revenue and new customers. This progress continued in Q1 with the company seeing online sales grow by 30%, as well as posting revenues of $1.24bn and generating profits of $0.74 a share. Despite this better than expected performance, management suspended guidance, though they did keep the dividend. Expectations are for profits of $0.88 a share.

Kheira Hamraoui és l'heroïna d'aquesta eliminatòria. En un final de partit d'infart, la francesa ha marcat el gol que el Barça portava gestant des de l'inici de la segona part de manera incansable. L'exjugadora del Lió és la dona dels gols decisius. Ja va marcar a les semifinals contra el Bayern de Munic la temporada passada, i als quarts de final d'aquesta fase final de la competició, a San Mamés, ho ha tornat a fer. Un gol a deu minuts del final que ha certificat el pas a semifinals de les blaugranes, que ja són més a prop de la final europea –que seria la segona consecutiva per a l'equip de Lluís Cortés–. El rival serà el temible Wolfsburg.
 L'inici del matx no ha estat fàcil. La fredor i l'expectació, tant a la gespa com a l'ambient, han marcat la primera part quasi tant com el joc i les ocasions. Tot i que l'enfrontament entre l'Atlètic de Madrid i el Barça era el primer partit oficial disputat des del març pels dos equips, hi havia aquesta sensació de tornar a la feina que sol acompanyar l'inici de les temporades. El matx, més que una eliminatòria a vida o mort per seguir a la Champions League, tenia el tarannà d'un partit de pretemporada. Ja no només per la intensitat –poc present en molts moments del partit–, sinó també per la immensitat de San Mamés amb les seves graderies, que solen fer tant de soroll, buides. El silenci de l'atmosfera de la Catedral només s'ha vist trencat pels crits –cada cop més intensos– de les jugadores.
 Els dos equips, conservadors a la primera part del partit, han intentat prendre els mínims riscos conscients que en l'eliminatòria a partit únic els petits errors et poden fer tornar a casa abans del que voldries. Les blaugranes, però, han estat les dominadores durant tot el partit. Les jugadores de Lluís Cortés, que tenien les idees clares, han intentat canalitzar el joc sobretot a partir d'Oshoala, Putellas i Hermoso, referents en l'atac de l'equip, però no han aconseguit batre la portera matalassera, Hedving Lindahl. L'equip català ha impressionat per la seva pressió postpèrdua de pilota, sense descans, que ha fet que tot el partit s'hagi disputat pràcticament al camp de l'Atlètic de Madrid.
 Les jugadores matalasseres, que abans del partit eren vistes com les principals candidates a la derrota perquè havien patit molts canvis i alguns positius per coronavirus, no han acceptat de bona gana aquest paper. Tot i tenir clar que la seva millor opció era el contraatac, han posat contra les cordes l'equip dirigit per Lluís Cortés amb velocitat i verticalitat. L'equip del tècnic Daniel González ha fet un molt bon paper en defensa. De fet, el tècnic de les madrilenyes ha arribat a alinear fins a cinc jugadores a la defensa i quatre al mig del camp. Amb les línies molt juntes per evitar espais on el Barça els pogués crear ocasions clares de perill, l'anglesa Duggan ha sigut l'única que han despenjat a la part del camp blaugrana per poder generar perill en cas de contraatac. La britànica, exjugadora del Barça, estava molt sola.
 A la segona part les presses han entrat a escena. Conscients que només quedaven 45 minuts de matx –cap dels dos equips volia arribar a la pròrroga després de tant de temps sense competir–, les de Lluís Cortés han anat de cara a barraca. I Asisat Oshoala i Alexia Putellas han estat les protagonistes. Primer la nigeriana, enviant la pilota fora pràcticament sola dins de l'àrea, i després Alexia, rematant una centrada contra la part exterior de la xarxa, han demostrat que les blaugranes tenien gana i volien endur-se la victòria que certifiqués el seu pas a semifinals de la Champions. Un altre xut de Graham Hansen que ha aturat Lindahl ha començat a crispar l'ambient. Les culers necessitaven un gol, conscients que en qualsevol acció les matalasseres podrien avançar-se en el marcador. L'entrada al camp de Mariona ha estimulat l'atac d'un Barça cada cop més superior. Però faltava el gol.
 No ha estat fins que faltaven deu minuts per al final que de les botes de Hamraoui –altre cop– ha sortit el gol que certificava el pas a les semifinals. Després d'un refús de la portera matalassera, la blaugrana ha enviat la pilota al fons de la xarxa. Sempre llesta, la francesa, que es va perdre la final de Budapest ara fa un any, ha aconseguit un gol clau.
 El Barça ja és a semifinals, tal com volia, i dimarts s'enfrontarà (20 h, Gol TV) al Wolfsburg en un escenari diferent, aquest cop a Anoeta. Les alemanyes han golejat per 9-1 les escoceses del Glasgow City. El repte serà majúscul.

California has processed more than 10.7 million claims for unemployment benefits since March. The federal government had been paying people an additional $600 per week, but those benefits expired at the end of July. Local workforce development boards have reported more people looking for work as a result, Bernick said.
 “It would have a sort of positive job impact, except that the jobs aren’t out there with the lockdowns,” Bernick said.
 July’s jobs report could be understated since it is based on surveys taken in the middle of the month. Since then, California has added several more counties to its monitoring list, which after three days trigger a new round of mandated business and school closings. Sung Won Sohn, a professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University, said the July jobs report reflects “old news.”
 “The new story is that the economy is slowing and I think the businesses are battening down the hatch,” he said.

The governor’s role in SB217 was largely symbolic – the stroke of his pen. The yeoman’s work of that bill was done by Black, Indigenous, and Brown activists and legislators. So what is the governor doing to protect Black lives? In at least one critical context –Colorado’s prisons – the answer is nothing. COVID-19 is rising in Colorado prisons, and it is Black people who will suffer the most. Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.

Thus, just as the 1907 Anglo-Russian convention closed out one of the great conflicts of the 19th century only to help enflame the great conflict of the 20th century, so the Israel-UAE agreement must be seen as part of the ending of a 20th-century conflict, but also as potentially the beginning of a new 21st-century conflict that may dominate the Middle East. In that Middle East, without an American hegemon to keep a lid on aggression, status quo powers as diverse in other ways as Israel and the UAE have no choice but to find common cause. To band together as best they can to fight their common enemy, as the British and Russians did in 1907. All of this is a recipe for greater tensions, fear, conflict, and potentially outright war.

Thursday: Against a backdrop of concerns about its precarious financial position, Rolls-Royce shares have continued to struggle since July's Q2 update, despite optimism that the second half of the year would be better than the first. There has been speculation that it may come under pressure to offload its Spanish operation ITP Aero while one of its major shareholders ValueAct has sold down its stake, over concern over the long-term viability of the business model. The impact on civil aviation and the grounding of commercial fleets has decimated its revenues, and could well lead to cash burn of over £4bn this year alone. Earlier this month the company reported a problem with another one of its engines, the XWB-84 which powers the A350, which on the back of its Trent 1000 issues, doesn't bode well, and might suggest a wider problem with quality control. Quite simply this is yet another problem Rolls-Royce doesn't need, and is likely to add further costs to an already strained business model.

As part of the State-wide campaign launched by TPCC to file criminal cases against Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar for demolition of Nalla Pochamma temple and masjids at the Secretariat, Congress leaders submitted memorandums to collectors on Friday.
 In Hyderabad, AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan along with Hyderabad Congress Committee chief Anjan Kumar Yadav, Nampally Congress in-charge Feroz Khan and others met Hyderabad Collector Shweta Mohanty and presented a memorandum addressing Governor Tamilisai Soudarajan, demanding filing of criminal cases against Mr. KCR and Mr. Kumar.
 The Congress delegation also stressed on the need for reconstruction of demolished religious structures at the same place. “KCR has been acting irresponsibly and not even respecting the religious sentiments and places of worship. A criminal case should be filed against the CM who is directly responsible for the demolition of Nalla Pochamma temple and two masjids,” said Dasoju Sravan while speaking to the media.
 He also demanded criminal cases against the Chief Secretary, whom he alleged was working hand in glove with KCR. “Government demolished these religious structures in the middle of the night to keep everyone in the dark and now using police to suppress those who are protesting against this draconian act. Mr. Kumar as a civil servant, instead of prevailing upon the CM, is acting subservient to KCR and perpetuating the misdeeds,” he alleged.
 He claimed that according to historians all the three religious structures in the Secretariat complex have historic significance. Masjid-e-Hashmi located at erstwhile D Block of Secretariat was built by the Nizams in 1889. Masjid Dafaatir-e-Muatamad was built during Congress rule in the past. Coming to Nalla Pochamma temple, this Hindu religious structure shot to fame all over the state, during the Telangana movement. This temple is considered auspicious by Telangana activists, he said.

But Joe has been alive for a long time, and American politics have an elephant-like tendency for remembering the past while considering the present and contemplating the future. Biden spent a considerable amount of time attacking the policies and character of the man he is seeking to unseat, going after President Trump by name and reputation. Under normal circumstances, such a tactic would bode well, given the reality of Trump's record as a Chief Executive and a human being over the course of the past three-plus years. From Trump's muted response to the Charlestown marches of the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists, to the Trump administration's fumbled actions regarding the management of the national Covid-19 response, Biden's speech writers were given a plethora of material to work with, most if not all of which hit home to some degree.

But it’s a fresh era at the Ospreys under new head coach Toby Booth and there is no little excitement in the squad. Memories of the horrors of last autumn and winter? No one mentions them.
 “The boys want to put the new coach’s philosophies into place rather than worry about what happened in the past,” says Tipuric.
 “We are beyond that and are looking forward.
 “It’s about learning and trying to put things right on the pitch.
 “What’s happened is past. For us, it’s all about the future.
 “It’s a fresh start.
 “We have new training facilities at St Helen’s, new coaches, new ways of playing. It’s a bit like a new club.
 “With everything that’s going on in the world, it is totally different.
 “Not much has been said about the spell we had.
 “We know we went bad and we don’t want a season like that again, that’s for sure.”
 The Ospreys pick up the threads with a home clash against the Dragons on Sunday. The extended break and changes behind the scenes, with the likes of Booth and attack coach Brock James coming in, have sharpened appetites.
 “You feel like a kid again in that you are really looking forward to playing after so long out,” says Tipuric.
 “That hunger is there.
 “You can see in training there’s a great buzz and everyone’s ready to get out there and play.
 “The Dragons are on a high.
 “They’ve had a lot of praise this season, and rightly so, for everything they’ve done.
 “I’m hearing from the boys how good a job Dean Ryan has done and how much of a good place it’s been for them.
 “Also, they have some new players.
 “They are coming down probably hoping they are going to turn us over, so we know it’s going to be a tough game.”
