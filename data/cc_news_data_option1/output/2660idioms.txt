“It was a hard-fought day for our No. 38 Fire Alarm Services, Inc. Ford Mustang. We were tight in traffic to start and it was difficult to keep the car turning when I was behind another car. Seth and the crew made some good adjustments throughout the day that helped our handling a lot. We got caught up there at the end, but still had a decent top-15 day. I’m proud of our Front Row Motorsports team’s continued effort in the shop and at the track each week. Huge shoutout to FAS and Digital Ally Body Cameras for coming on board with us today. We’ll regroup this week and come back ready for Kentucky."

When is the next stimulus check coming? The Fourth of July weekend has come and gone, which means the calendar has inched closer to a time when the U.S. Senate will be back in session and debating legislation.
 It’s been signaled in recent days by multiple outlets that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could take up discussion on the House-passed HEROES Act early in the next session, which starts July 20. If the bill is ever passed, it would net millions of eligible Americans a second stimulus payment similar to the one that came out of the CARES Act earlier this year to help those struggling because of the shutdowns tied to the coronavirus pandemic.
 August is thus the month to watch for those seeking an income boost. It’s likely that the IRS could mobilize to start sending checks, direct deposits, or prepaid debit cards faster than it did in the spring, but it would still take some time, and thus we might be able to expect a second payment to go out by the middle to end of the calendar’s eighth month.
 There has been lots of smoke when it comes to a second stimulus payment — lawmakers have been talking about it more recently — and, although most of those folks were on vacation during the Fourth of July holiday, Cnet reports the Senate will have a period of 15 days between July 20-Aug. 7 where the package could be hammered out and agreed upon. If it doesn’t happen then, there’s another window — Sept. 8-25 — when the package could be agreed on.
 But, again, provided things go smoothly, the site reports that August is when money could begin to be sent out.
 The next stimulus bill would come out of the HEROES Act, which is a follow up to the CARES Act and has passed the House but not the Senate. It would give $1,200 to single filers and $2,400 to married filers, and up to three dependents would get $1,200 as well. Additionally, those with a taxpayer identification number would get a payment, as opposed to CARES, which was just for those with a social security number.
 To see how much you could get from a second check, direct deposit, or debit card, you can visit the Omni Calculator or use its embeddable tool below to punch in your information to see what kind of cash could be headed your way.

Multiple West representatives did not immediately respond for comment about details pertaining to West’s campaign. There has been no other public mention made from him or his staff regarding his run for presidency.
 This is not the first time West has announced his candidacy for president.
 In 2015, he said on multiple occasions he would run for president in 2020, but then reversed course to 2024.
 When Donald Trump entered the fold as a legitimate candidate and later elected president, West appeared to have stepped back his 2020 intentions. West has voiced his support for and friendship with Trump on numerous occasions.
 SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has voiced his support for West’s campaign.
 In May 2018, West told RollingStone magazine his presidential campaign would be a combination of “the (Donald) Trump campaign and maybe the Bernie Sanders principles.”
 West has been particularly vocal on a number of political and social issues including reducing taxes, creating housing for the homeless, opposing abortion and improving racial inequality. When it comes to the latter, West recently expressed frustration with the relationship between the African American community and Democratic party, and in 2018 criticized the 13th Amendment as a green light to enslave convicts.

On his most recent album “Jesus Is King” he discussed many of these issues.
 “The liberal will try to control a black person through the concept of racism because they know we are very proud, emotional people,” he said during a 2018 visit he paid to Trump at the White House.
 During that visit he voiced his support for the second amendment, and has also expressed a need for fashion manufacturing to become more environmentally friendly.
 This June he also released a song opposing police brutality and he donated $2 million to help multiple victims of police brutality, including paying off George Floyd’s daughter’s college tuition.
 West has pledged to bring manufacturing back to the United States through his Yeezy line.
 “We would’ve created so many jobs that I’m not going to run (for president), I’m going to walk,” West said in a 2019 interview.
 The desire to bring back American jobs seems to be one of the motivating factors for him bringing certain operations for his company to Cody. He recently told the Enterprise the Gap partnership Yeezy recently entered in will bring jobs to Cody.
 “I’m here to be of service and be a servant to Jesus Christ, to my wife and children, to my uncles, aunts and cousins, to my friends, to my community, and you know I got to do it to my country,” West said.
 A spring 2018 CNN poll found West a favorable candidate of only 23% of voters, with 24% unsure.
 He had not filed as of Monday morning and has missed the filing deadline to get on the ballot in five states.
