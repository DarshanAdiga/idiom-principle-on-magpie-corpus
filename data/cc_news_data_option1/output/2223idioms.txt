Telecom stocks have been among the biggest gainers over the past month on the back of strong March quarter results, increased interest of technology giants in this sector, and expectations of gradual increase in tariffs over the next few quarters. The lower impact of the Covid-19 crisis and a jump in data consumption have boosted its attractiveness.
 While Bharti Airtel has moved up 11 per cent, Reliance Industries (RIL) -- on the back of a slew of deals in Jio Platforms - has gained nine per cent. But, the biggest gainers have been Bharti Infratel (which has surged 39 per cent) and ...

AEW is seemingly planting the seeds for a split between MJF and Wardlow and Hauser talked about what fans should expect of Wardlow.
 "Wardlow's push is dead. Wardlow is basically on the same wavelength as Kip Sabian in that he's a great worker with a great look but there's not a lot going on," said Hauser.
 He added that it feels too early to split Wardlow and MJF but maybe these big guys like Archer and Wardlow could form something like a Dungeon of Doom. Hauser also talked about another guy without much momentum in Shawn Spears.
 "Last time I interviewed with you, we talked about Shawn Spears and I said I'm afraid a guy like him is gonna get lost in the shuffle. That interview was 4-6 months ago and what's happened since? Not much. He's gotten some TV time but it's not like he was ever bigger than his chairman of the board moment when he whacked Cody in the head," said Hauser.
 Many have noticed a trend of AEW shuffling up who they are pushing in a given week. Hauser discussed what he thinks the intent of that is and why it may not be a good thing.
 "They are kinda building towards a second TV show which I assume won't happen until next year. The word on the street is that they're gonna have a whole another program so maybe they're starting to shift things and figure out who goes where and who does what," said Hauser.
 "My biggest hope for them in expanding is that I hope they don't overdo it. Because if you're grabbing 7-8 guys from the indies or WWE, then that's gonna blow up the roster. Then suddenly a guy like Shawn Spears or Brodie Lee is not gonna get a chance for the title."
 Former Impact World Champion Brian Cage made his AEW debut at Double or Nothing and he won the Casino Ladder Match in his debut. Hauser talked Cage's introduction to the AEW audience.
 "I think Cage had one of the best AEW debuts yet. Matt Hardy's debut was another one of those where he desperately could have used an audience. Weirdly enough, I thought Brian Cage had enough pomp and circumstance with his in-ring ability and having Taz by his side. It felt like a really solid debut," said Hauser before weighing in on the Casino Ladder Match.
 "It was a little clunky. The spots seemed a little all over the place but that's par for the course for that type of match. I'm a big battle royal guy and I kinda miss the Casino Battle Royals. But I would like to see more ladder matches for titles. I think a great match in the future is Cody vs. Kenny Omega in a ladder match for the TNT Title. I think that could be a real showstopper and a Match of the Year type of match."
 In addition to his film roles, Hauser is also a recurring character on the YouTube series Cobra Kai. The series was renewed for a third season and Hauser talked about when fans can expect it to premiere.
 "I can't say much but the word I am hearing is that there is some movement with the show and how it's gonna land and how they want to present it. They're taking their time to be strategic," stated Hauser. "They don't wanna just dump it because people are asking for it. What I do know is that the creators said they think it might be the best season yet."

Microsoft claimed that the Surface Book is the “ultimate laptop” when it was first unveiled, and indeed the latest news on this nifty ultraportable underlines the power under its hood, not to mention the device's flexibility.
 You may recall that Redmond said the Surface Book is twice as fast as a MacBook Pro – but according to PC World's benchmarking, it's actually even quicker than this in terms of pixel shifting.
 PC World pitted a MacBook Pro 13-inch 2015 with a Core i5 processor boasting Iris 6100 graphics against a Core i5 Surface Book clipboard (tablet) section plugged into a base unit from a different machine with the discrete Nvidia graphics chip on-board(the reason for this was the different Surface Book had a Core i7 CPU, so in itself wasn't a fair comparison to directly benchmark against the MacBook).
 More about those swapping shenanigans in a moment, but as for the benchmarks, Microsoft's laptop ran Tomb Raider (1400 x 900 resolution, normal quality) at 74 fps, whereas the MacBook only managed 24 fps. In other words, the Surface Book was actually three times as fast when it came to running a game.
 With an artificial gaming benchmark, namely Heaven 4.0 (1366 x 768 resolution, medium quality with 2xAA), Microsoft's machine managed 39 fps, with Apple's laptop lagging behind on 18 fps.
 With the CPU tests, such as CineBench and Geek Bench, things were pretty much even, but the gaming performance is clearly and impressively tilted in Microsoft's favour, with that discrete GPU making a big difference.
 Moving on, another remarkable feature of the Surface Book is the swapping shenanigans we referred to earlier. Users can simply swap the clipboard section with a different base unit and it works seamlessly.
 As the GPU is in the base unit, if you want to upgrade your Surface Book it's just a simple matter of swapping in a new base.
 Microsoft confirmed this fact to The Next Web, and said that even with the entry-level Core i5 Surface Book with integrated graphics, you can switch to a high-end base with a much more powerful discrete GPU.
 And of course, PC World's testing also confirmed this swapping procedure works just fine.
 When the Surface Book 2 emerges, this should hopefully make for some seamless upgrading, although do note it's still uncertain whether Microsoft will actually sell the base unit separately. We'd hope that's been the plan all along, but you never know…

The prayers of environmental campaigners have finally been answered by Toyota's assertion that regular petrol vehicles will be all but extinct by 2050.
 Toyota announced at a Tokyo museum that it plans to persuade governments, affiliated companies and stakeholders to reduce average emissions from its vehicles by 90% by 2050.
 Its main push will be behind the fuel cell and hybrid vehicles that are already performing impressively in the sales department. Annual sales of hybrid vehicles are on track to reach 1.5 million by 2020 and that means that it will have sold 15 million hybrids by that date, twice the total number sold worldwide to date.
 The numbers of its fuel cell vehicles are far lower with the expectation that it will shift 30,000 a year by 2020 and that can be expected to push on further as time goes on. You may have noticed that fully electric vehicles are conspicuous by their absence and Toyota didn't reveal any plans in that regard.
 Hybrid vehicles use a combination of a regularly fuelled internal combustion engine and a battery power unit and as such they do in fact use some form of petrol or diesel in order to work, although it's still far less than a full-on petrol or diesel fuelled vehicle.
 Toyota's plans in this department are focused on its popular Prius range that will see its first major update since 2009 next year when the company brings us a new vehicle with 10% fuel economy and plenty of new tech to boot.

Saudi Arabia made some of the biggest price increases for crude exports in at least two decades, doubling down on its strategy to bolster the oil market after OPEC+ producers extended historic output cuts.The steepest jump will hit July exports to Asia, state producer Saudi Aramco's largest regional market, according to a pricing list seen by Bloomberg. Overall, the increases for Saudi crude erase almost all of the discounts the kingdom made during its brief price war with Russia.The sharp price increases show that Saudi Arabia is using all the tools at its disposal to turn around the oil market after prices plunged into negative territory in April. As the price setter in the Middle East, the increases in its official prices may be followed by other producers.Tighter crude supply is helping repair an oil market battered by the coronavirus. Unprecedented output cuts led by the Saudis and Russia boosted prices in May, and the OPEC+ group decided Saturday to extend those limits through July. Brent crude, down 36% this year, has clawed back some of its losses and ended trading on Friday at more than $40 a barrel.But the profits that oil refiners make from processing crude into fuel are struggling to keep up with the rising market, and the sharp Saudi price hikes are likely to exacerbate that problem. Representatives for refineries from Europe and Asia expressed concern and said the pricing would crush margins.Price WarSaudi Arabia unleashed a price war in March when it slashed official selling prices by the most in three decades. The kingdom took that drastic step after failing to reach an agreement with Russia to extend production cuts in the face of the pandemic's destruction of oil demand.After Tweets, phone calls and top-level consultations, OPEC+ returned to negotiations and hammered out the biggest output curbs in history, pledging to take nearly 10 million barrels a day off the market. US production plunged by roughly 2 million barrels daily as low prices drove producers to shut wells.OPEC+ chose on Saturday to renew production limits at almost the same level, instead of tapering them as planned at the end of June. Aramco, which typically announces pricing on the fifth day of each month, had delayed its July numbers until after OPEC+ members made their decision.Saudi Arabia sells its crude at a differential to oil benchmarks, announcing every month the discount or premium it's charging to global refiners. The so-called official selling prices help set the tone in the physical oil market, where actual barrels change hands.With China's demand for crude now rising, the Saudis are raising prices. The month-on-month increase in the official selling price for flagship Arab Light crude to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Saudi oil sales, is the largest in at least 20 years. Aramco raised Arab Light to Asia by $6.10 a barrel to a premium of 20 cents over the benchmark.It raised July pricing for all grades to Asia by between $5.60 and $7.30 a barrel. That compares with an expected increase of about $4 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg survey of eight traders and refiners.Buyers in the US, the Mediterranean region and Northwest Europe will also pay more for oil.

In addition to the screening questions, the foreman of each shift takes the temperature of every employee on their shift. No one, according to Kocur, gets into the building without going through a health and wellness screening.
 Kocur also said, an additional health and wellness screening is administered midway through the shift. If the screening is successful, the employee continues work, but if not, whether because of exposure or the onset of COVID symptoms, employees are immediately asked to leave the building and report to a testing site.
 “We’ll send the employee out to get tested, and if the employee doesn’t have health insurance, then Confer Plastics is covering that charge,” Kocur said.
 If the employee tests positive, the entire facility is shut down, Kocur said.
 That has not happened yet, and hopefully it doesn’t, said Kocur, but all precautions are taken, some of which go “above and beyond,” and continue to foster the trust the workers have for their employer. For example, coming into work, during this newest new-normal, is also different.
 “We’re going to pay you from the moment you arrive,” Kocur said. “If you arrive early for a 7 o’clock shift, and you arrive at 6:20, we’re going to start paying you from that time forward, just to not have that funnel when employees show up all at one time.”

The Forum for People's Collective Efforts (FPCE), a forum of homebuyers, has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention for interest waiver on home loans. It also wants the extension of project completion by builders to be restricted to only the actual lockdown period.In a letter to the Prime Minister dated June 1, the association suggested that the government's policy should focus on homebuyers instead of builders for revival of this sector, reports news agency PTI. The forum has requested PM Modi to issue directions to the ministry of housing and urban affairs to modify its advisory that provides a blanket extension to all real estate projects across the country for at least six month with an additional three months at states' discretion, over and above the one year already provided under section 6 of the realty law RERA.Instead, it said that the extension in projects completion timeline should only be for the actual period of lockdown when construction wasn't permitted."Anything other than this, is patently illegal and should not be promoted by the very custodians of the law," it said.Pointing out that the extension in projects' timelines "increases the EMI, rent, mental agony and harassment," the letter said that it is the home buyers who need support from the government. "In-fact, Sir it is the home buyers of the country who are in dire need for support from your government as they are facing unprecedented job losses and pay-cuts," the letter said.Last month, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , as part of the Centre's economic stimulus to industries affected by the coronavirus outbreak, had said that the Covid-19 pandemic should be considered an event of 'force majeure' or an 'act of God' and announced to extend the registration and completion date by six months of all projects registered under the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). This would apply to all real estate project registrations expiring on or after 25 March and individual applications are not needed.The homebuyerrs body said the government has given a moratorium on EMI payments for six months, but it would only increase the future interest liabilities.The FPCE has also suggested waiver of interest amount during the moratorium period on EMIs payable by home buyers. It sought amendment in section 24(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, removing the 5 years limitation in claiming deductions on interest on home loans.The benefit of reduction in interest rate should be automatically passed on by the banks to all borrowers, existing and new ones, the FPCE letter said.

 Start with a good microphone, advises Jon Ewell, a San Diego podcast and music producer. Either purchase a microphone, or that mic in your iPad, computer or iPhone will do.

Though the Street is bullish on the sector, not all are on the same page as far as the sector remaining a three-player market in the long term is concerned. Rajeev Sharma, head of institutional research at SBICAP Securities, says: "For the telecom sector to settle to a threeplayer market, Vodafone Idea needs a strategic investor to take a substantial stake, an extended payment period on adjusted gross revenues, and finally meaningful capex on 4G." The company needs to gain market share across circles to be in the reckoning, he adds. While the sector has already been rerated, the key trigger remains a further rise in ARPUs. Tariffs were last raised in December by 25-40 per cent. Most analysts expect ARPUs to move to the Rs 200-mark, from the current Rs 154 for Bharti Airtel and Rs 130.6 for Reliance Jio. The increase in ARPUs is expected, given the low mobile revenue to GDP ratio in India, a fall in competitive intensity, and pricing discipline.

It’s being called the “Covid-slide.” It began mid-March when the schools were shut down and teachers and their students were sent home and expected to keep the learning process alive and well remotely.
 It didn’t work. According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, the challenges were overwhelming and the research showed that students returning in the fall will have about 70 percent of the reading skills they would normally have and 50 percent of their math skills. That’s the “slide.”
 For the majority of students, learning remotely doesn’t match in-class learning, which should surprise absolutely no one. The pandemic struck quickly; teachers could not adapt fast enough to switch from in-school teaching to teaching remotely. Nor could they be expected to. Students — particularly in the younger years — struggled in a unfamiliar system that could not adapt to their individual needs. Researchers also noted that just because students are adept at using their digital devices doesn’t mean they can make the switch from playing video games to using Zoom to listen to a teacher.
 The story plays out like one might expect, and like it plays out on many other fronts. The students who have the digital tools and have supportive families out-perform their classmates who don’t have the tools and whose parents are not supportive. It’s a continuation of the divide between the haves and the have-nots.
 In Vermont we have between 15 percent and 19 percent of our students without reliable internet connection. How are they suppose to participate on a consistent basis? As any teacher knows, there is also a consistent percentage of the students in a classroom who are there because they have to be and whose success depends on a teacher being able to make that essential one-on-one connection. That relationship doesn’t exist in a remote learning setting. Teachers will tell you a fair number of their students opted not to participate. Teachers lost contact.
 It’s also understood we have a solid percentage of students for whom school is the only safe place they have and the only place that feeds them regularly. Take from them their safe place, and their access to proper nutrition, and their social connections, and you have a group of students being left behind, and at risk, and for whom the challenges will only increase.
 These challenges go further up the socio-economic ladder than one might expect. Most parents kept their jobs during the pandemic, but worked from home. Doing their jobs and making sure their kids’ homework was completed, and their questions answered, is taxing, to say the least. The older the students, the more problematic it is for a parent to help. [A geometry question? Answer: Kahn Academy look it up.]
 The “Covid-slide” took place over roughly 10 weeks. The concern is this slide may extend through the summer and fall. If schools are required to continue with their remote learning formats, the damage done to those students who struggled from March through the beginning of June will be compounded. Even if schools put in place a hybrid system with in-school learning for part of the week and remote learning for the remainder, the students will get less of an education than they would have in their regular settings. That understanding should make a return to in-school teaching the state’s top priority.
 Our first responsibility is provide a safe setting for both our teachers and students. That’s a given. But as we approach the fall semester we also need to know that it’s also not safe — in the largest sense of the word — to allow the “Covid-slide” to rob our students of their education.

Later, after World War II, the American forces occupied Germany and Japan for several years. While regular police at home received notice from the FBI that they could now obtain surplus machine guns and leg irons from the War Assets Administration, US police trendsetters like Vollmer, his protégé Orlando W Wilson, and future Los Angeles police chief William Parker were working to “democratize” the German police, while also making sure to keep tabs on communists. Similarly, in Japan, a young policeman from Kansas City named Byron Engle helped to reorganize the police there, introducing US-style uniforms, handcuffs and teargas.

The National Telecommunications & Information Administration Monday (April 26) handed out the last of its grants in the first round (there will be two NTIA rounds) of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), which is the broadband investment portion of the stimulus package.
 According to NTIA, it gave out $1.2 billion of its allocation (it has $4.7 billion) to projects affecting 45 states and territories.
 The most recent grants totaled $114 million and included infrastructure grants plus a $28.5 million multi-state adoption grant for computer training broadband awareness, applications, and wireless Internet in 50 cities and towns in 31 states.
 NTIA is currently vetting the second round of bidders for its broadband bucks.
 The program has come under fire from existing broadband providers because they say some of the money is going to overbuild in areas where there is already broadband service.

Telecom stocks have been among the biggest gainers over the past month on the back of strong March quarter results, increased interest of technology giants in this sector, and expectations of gradual increase in tariffs over the next few quarters. The lower impact of the Covid-19 crisis and a jump in data consumption have boosted its attractiveness. While Bharti Airtel has moved up 11 per cent, Reliance Industries (RIL) -- on the back of a slew of deals in Jio Platforms - has gained nine per cent. But, the biggest gainers have been Bharti Infratel (which has surged 39 per cent) and Vodafone Idea (its stock has doubled over this period). Thanks to the Bharti twins, the telecom sector has been the biggest gainer in the Nifty50 since March lows; it has more than doubled its weighting in the Nifty since December, according to a Motilal Oswal Financial Services report.

In the U.S., the virus churns on underneath the unrest provoked by the death of George Floyd and increasingly directed at President Donald Trump’s handling of the protests.
 On Sunday, the U.K. revealed that places of worship can reopen from June 15 — but only for private prayer.
 Worries have surfaced over the past couple of weeks that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is easing the restrictions too soon, with new infections potentially still running at 8,000 a day. As things stands, nonessential shops, including department stores, are due to reopen on June 15.
 Professor John Edmunds, who attends meetings of the British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said the epidemic “is definitely not all over” and that there is an “awful long way to go.”

BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW/CNN) - When a high school senior from New York decided to help clean up his community after some destructive protests, he was rewarded with a car, insurance for a year and a full college scholarship.Antonio Gwynn, 18, was watching protests Monday night on Facebook Live when he saw some demonstrations become destructive in his home city of Buffalo, New York.Antonio Gwynn, 18, spent 10 hours cleaning up his community in Buffalo, New York, after some destructive protests. He says it’s something his mother, who died in 2018, would have done.“I felt disgusted. My nerves were bad. They're destroying a city that could actually be very beautiful,” Gwynn said.In the middle of the night, Gwynn left his house and spent the next 10 hours cleaning up the community. He says it’s something his mother, who died in 2018, would have done.When Matt Block heard about Gwynn’s good deed, he decided to pitch in by giving the 18-year-old his 2004 red convertible Mustang."I couldn't come to grips with selling it, and this was a good way for me to get rid of it and know someone that gets it is going to appreciate it, I think," Block said.Bob Briceland from Briceland Insurance Agency will be covering Gwynn’s insurance for one year.“I just felt compelled to help him out. We just need to get together our whole city and show people how there's so many good people here," Briceland said.Gwynn says he has also been offered a full ride to Buffalo’s Medaille College. The high school senior had originally planned to go to trade school and save up for college. Now, he can complete that goal right away, studying business and mechanics on the side.Gwynn says the red Mustang convertible looks exactly like the first car his late mother bought him.“I literally stopped, pulled over and started crying. So did my great aunt, and my little cousin did, also,” Gwynn said. “It doesn't feel real. It feels like this is a movie going on."Gwynn intends to start his own car repair shop, and of course, he plans to continue paying all this kindness forward."I always wanted to be someone that can help everyone with their car problems, so this is a great opportunity I have right in front of me," he said.Gwynn says he hopes his mother would be proud of him.Copyright 2020 WKBW, Matt Block via CNN.

Universities are waiting for more details on the order from the Trump administration, including which Chinese universities will be covered by a visa ban, but a State Department official said a list would not be published “anytime soon.”
 If the list is narrowly drawn to include only institutions directly tied to the military — analogous to West Point in the United States — the impact would be relatively small, Bienenstock said.
 But Susan Shirk, a leading China expert with UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy, said she and others fear that federal officials could include all universities that receive any funding from the Chinese military, which would potentially sweep in far more students. That would be akin to targeting the many top U.S. research universities that receive Pentagon funding, almost exclusively for non-classified research, she said.
 “We’re concerned about a slippery slope here,” Shirk said. “I’m definitely concerned that it would very much discourage talented Chinese students from doing graduate work or research at American universities, which would be very counterproductive from the standpoint of our scientific and technological innovation.”

Already this year, Swatch has given us the oddest fitness wearable ever, with thebeach-volleyball-themed Touch Zero One. Now it gives us the oddly-named but actually quite sensible Swatch Bellamy, a standard Swatch with an NFC chip for payments. But only in China.
 The NFC (near field communication) tech in the Bellamy range allows you to pay on Union Pay contactless payment terminals in China. The watches are on sale solely from the nation's fun-sounding Bank of Communications.
 Rather than taking money from your bank account or acting as a credit card, the Bellamy will need to be prepaid, like Barclays' bPay systemover here.
 According to Swatch, Bellamy will later roll out in its home nation of Switzerland and then America, where contactless payment is still viewed as witchcraft in at least 20 states. Seriously, how is it that the world's most technologically advanced economy doesn't evn have chip and PIN in most shops yet?
 As with Apple Pay, there are few technical impediments to the NFC chip working with any contactless payment terminal, anywhere in the world, subject to the right agreements being inked.
 The Bellamy is actually named after American Writer Edward Bellamy, who was a bit of an HG Wells figure. In 1888 he wrote, Looking Backward 2000-1887, a book that, like Wells' more famous The Shape of Things to Come and The Time Machine, looked forward to the future. One of Bellamy's predictions was that by 2000, cash would be replaced by credit/debit cards (spot on) leading to a utopian society (maybe not so much).
 The Bellamy is also the first fruits, presumably, of what Swatch CEO Nick Hayek was talking about here.

The commitment to a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians has been in part a psychological trick, as its prospects have visibly diminished. To admit a one-state reality is to be forced to choose between Israel’s democracy and its Jewishness—and few want to be put in that position. It’s much easier to present existing inequality in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories as a temporary state of affairs, not as a permanent one requiring painful choices.
