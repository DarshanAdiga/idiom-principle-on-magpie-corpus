"With oil prices sagging lately, the door has been opened for a notable decline in U.S. gasoline prices, and that's exact what has happened, with more declines likely coming ahead of us before the fun is over," said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. "The Midwest has been the largest beneficiary of seasonal effects thus far with prices in several areas there declining upwards of 10-15 cents per gallon. The rest of the country will follow lower for the time being as demand for gasoline remains abysmal and the fuel being produced today will have to eventually be purged from the system over the next few months as refiners begin the transition to summer gasoline."

Strangely, the 5G supporting Snapdragon 765G is the same chipset used in the Redmi K30 5G. It would be a weird move for the brand to include a 5G-enabled chipset in a supposed ‘Lite’ model. Moreover, in another recent leak, Poco also requested certification for a handset with the model number M1912G8BI. This model number is the regular 4G variant of the Redmi K30 that features a Snapdragon 730G processor.

Fewer than half even crack the 50-percent threshold. (Shout out to Hawaii, which clocks in at 76.3 percent driver-originated funding; still, even those drivers can't accurately say they pay for every last penny of the roads they use.)

Neff and Chesterton's Gavin Layman (24-3), who've met a couple times in the offseason and attended a couple clinics together, squared off for the fourth time in the last two years and the first time this season. While Neff has won all four matches, each one has been a grind, much like this one, where an early escape accounted for the only point for the bulk of the match.
 "I expected it to be a very close match," Neff said. "I knew from last year, it was going to be low-scoring. I was going to really work to get a takedown and have to ride him out as best I could, not let him ride me out, turn me or make any stupid mistakes. I knew the one who pushed the pace more would be the winner. It could've been either one of us. Anything can happen. I'll be seeing him again, sectionals, maybe even regionals."
 It looked like Neff was going to win 1-0 in regulation but he was called for locked hands in the final seconds and the penalty point tied the match, forcing extra time. Neff regrouped, needing little time to score the winner.
 "I didn't think it was locked hands personally, but after that, I said, 'OK, stuff like this happens, hold him down, get to overtime, get a solid takedown and win the match,'" Neff said. "My coach says no negative thoughts, only positive, and that's what I did."
 By day's end, Neff (30-3) looked like he'd been through some battles, having to stuff plugs up his nose after an errant elbow in his first match caused it to bleed.
 "I got hit in the nose a couple times, I just kept catching a hand or something," he said. "It didn't hurt, but it did affect my breathing a little bit."
 Slicers coach Louie Kuzdas was happy to see his senior break through to reach the top of the podium.
 "As hard as he works, the time he puts in, to finally get some reward, you could tell how much it meant to him," Kuzdas said. "We train to get into overtime. A lot of times, guys get to overtime and they panic. We just had to keep doing what we were doing. I don't think (Layman) threatened as much as we thought. We were the one putting on the pressure, the one going forward. That will help us down the road if we see him again."
 Elsewhere for La Porte, freshman Ashton Jackson was third at 106, as was Tyson Nisley at 145.

 Missoula's youth had a clear message at a rally at the Roxy Theater just before the community gathering at St. Anthony. Empower Montana hosted the youth rally to give students a chance to share their experience. Brandon Pannell and Elizabeth Mills-Low, both students on Empower's Youth Advisory Council, talked about the disparities they endure in school, but both spoke also about the change they hope to develop through the organization.
 "Although issues in my school are not resolved yet, and most likely will not be in my time there, I know that I am making a difference in the long run, by teaching others and holding space for conversations," Mills-Low told the audience.
 Valeria Miranda, keynote speaker for the youth rally and a junior at the University of Montana, shared her own experiences in growing up in a public school system that made her feel more like a statistic until she began engaging in civic groups. But through grade school, while learning about "the greatness of our country," Miranda said the "greatness" typically came through a lesson about a prominent white, Christian man — that was, until she learned about King.
 "He was the only one I could relate to based on the color of my skin," she said.

GRAY - The Terrebonne High girls' basketball team wanted to end a losing streak against District 7-5A rival H.L. Bourgeois on Friday.
 The Lady Braves swept the Lady Tigers last season. Terrebonne hasn't defeated H.L. Bourgeois in girls' basketball since 2017.
 So after finally beating H.L. Bourgeois 50-43 on Friday, members of Terrebonne's senior class (Trinity Pierce, Taylor Hartman and Ariel Celestin) said it felt good to finally get past the Lady Braves with a win.
 "It was a big win because last year we lost to them twice, so we wanted to come out this year and make a difference," Pierce said. "We were motivated to get a win."
 "It's the best thing in the world," Hartman said. "We've been losing to them and we shouldn't have been losing to them. Now that we've got it, we've just got to keep moving forward."
 Pierce scored 20 points in Terrebonne's win, which improved their record to 17-7 overall and 4-2 in district play. Beyonce Henry had 13 points, and Arecia Celestin scored eight points.
 "It feels pretty good," Terrebonne coach Byron McPherson said. "It's a tough district, so every win is a big win."
 It was a typical close game between the two longtime rivals. Terrebonne led 11-10 after the first quarter, 25-19 at halftime and 35-29 at the end of the third quarter.
 With J'sa McGuire (17 points) leading the way, the Lady Braves stormed back in the fourth quarter to tie score at 35 with 5:35 left in the fourth quarter.
 But Terrebonne went on a late fourth quarter run, which was highlighted by a 3-pointer from Arecia Celestin and six points from Henry, to close out the victory late.
 Despite committing several turnovers, McPherson said he enjoyed watching the Lady Tigers execute late to win the game.
 "I'm proud of them because normally we struggle in situations like that," McPherson said. "We played tough. We kept our composure and we executed down the stretch. We're still learning as we go. I'm happy with the outcome. I'm happy we didn't make it as hard as it could've been."
 H.L. Bourgeois coach Michael Melancon said the Lady Braves (12-8 overall; 1-4 in district) just couldn't avoid turnovers in the fourth quarter. H.L. Bourgeois has lost five games by a total of 23 points this season.
 "We just keep shooting ourselves in the foot," Melancon said. "We worked so hard to get back in the game. When we start trusting each other and playing basketball as a team, this team is going to be alright. We're there. We just have to figure out how we can get over the top."
 Megan McElroy added six points for the Lady Braves.
 H.L. BOURGEOIS 78, TERREBONNE 54 (BOYS)
 At Gray, Terrebonne exploded in the first quarter to take a 17-11 lead, but the Braves dominated the rest of the way.
 H.L. Bourgeois rallied back to take a 36-27 lead at halftime and a 56-37 advantage at the end of the third quarter.
 H.L. Bourgeois coach Andrew Caillouet said it was a slow start for the Braves in the first quarter.
 "We had a really bad practice (on Thursday)," Caillouet said. "I was worried. Give (Terrebonne coach Richard) Jones and his team credit. D'Jon Scott and Chavez Brown both had great games. They played hard, and we just played flat. We played well in spurts but you can't be a good team and play spurty."
 In the second quarter, the Braves made adjustments with their defensive pressure, which helped turn the momentum of the District 7-5A game into their favor.
 "I thought that was the difference in what got us going with our full court pressure," Caillouet said. "We just started rolling a little bit. We got some turnovers and easy baskets."
 Deondre Buggage led the Braves with 35 points, while Renard Burdis had 10 points, Jameian Buxton had eight points and Damon Watkins and Logan Schwab each had seven points.
 Buggage, who nailed six 3-pointers on Friday, said he was glad to see the Braves make a big run in the second quarter.
 "It was very big, especially with our crowd behind us," Buggage said. "We just have to keep pushing, moving forward, maintain our focus and just keep going."
 Chavez Brown led Terrebonne with 28 points, and D'Jon Scott scored 12 points.
 "I'm extremely proud of my group for playing hard all night," Jones said. "(Friday) we played guys that are 'All-In.' And at the end of the day, that's what you want as a coach even if the scoreboard doesn't reflect it. We know internally what we accomplished because we are trying to build a brotherhood."

Furman kicker Grayson Atkins from Boiling Springs High School was looking for a place to attend grad school on scholarship and perhaps have a higher profile for the possibility of eventually playing in the NFL.
   
 North Carolina was looking for a dependable kicker.
   
 Atkins, an All-American for the Paladins and soon to be an early graduate, announced Sunday on Twitter that he will transfer to North Carolina and be eligible to play immediately.
   
 "Thank you, Paladin Nation, for your continued support, thoughts and prayers," Atkins wrote. "I will forever be proud to be a Furman Paladin. I have decided to finish my degree in three years and graduate in May. After talking with my family and lots of prayer, the Lord has blessed me with the scholarship opportunity to play my final year of eligibility as a graduate transfer at the University of North Carolina."
   
 Atkins will compete with Noah Ruggles and Jonathan Kim for kicking duties, but both of them had trouble keeping confidence of the coaches. Nuggles was benched after he missed a pair of field goal tries in overtime against Virginia Tech. He regained his spot after Kim missed the next week against Duke.
   
 One of the all-time greats not only at Furman but in Southern Conference history, Atkins made 18 straight field goals to set records for both. He finished last season 13-for-15 with a long of 55 yards and one of the misses being just wide from 59. He also ranked second in the league by averaging 43.5 yards per punt and helped Furman lead the SoCon with a 41.8 net punting average. As a sophomore, he was 11-for-13 with the misses coming from 48 and 50. That season he became the first FCS player since 1983 to make three field goals of at least 50 yards in one game.
   
 Atkins has been named All-America by STATS FCS, Phil Steele and Street and Smith's.
   
 While at Boiling Springs, he set a school record with a 50-yard field goal, led the state with 101 kicking points in a season and received the Chandler Catanzaro Award for top kicker in the state.

The principle is not what drove them; empty bellies were quite enough. Freedom was their touchstone perhaps, but mostly insofar as one could not be substantively free so long as one could not feed one’s family. The winners didn’t leave the places where they were winning, and why would they? If one were doing well in the old world, why would one choose to get on a boat with one’s kith and kin and take to the high seas in search of a new start? No indeed, the winners stayed put, while the losers climbed aboard and made the journey.
