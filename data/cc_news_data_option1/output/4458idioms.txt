Shortly after graduating, a former teacher mentioned Taylor’s name to Ross Walters, a pageant coach out of Lafayette who messaged Taylor to see if she’d be interested in competing in an upcoming pageant.


  Though she was searching for something new to focus on with sports no longer in the picture, Taylor said she was hesitant about stepping into the pageant world and needed some convincing.


  “At first, I was like, ‘Absolutely not,” Taylor said. “I just never thought I would do a pageant or be a pageant girl. Then my mom kept telling me I should try it out, so I did.


  “And I ended up loving it.”


  She also ended up winning: Three weeks after Walters, who now serves as her coach, messaged her, Taylor was being crowned Miss Teen Lafayette, which secured her a spot in the Miss Teen Louisiana contest in October 2019.


  Despite winning her first pageant, Taylor said her nerves walking before the judges “were all over the place.”


  “I was very nervous and really wasn’t expecting to do well, especially when I did the interview portion with the judges,” she said. “I didn’t think of myself as a good speaker, so I didn’t think I had a shot. I was really just doing it for fun.


  “But once I won, I was just like, ‘Now I have to win the next one.’”


  With four months to prepare, Taylor ended up winning the Miss Teen Louisiana contest, her priceless reaction captured in a photo she later posted on her Instagram page with the caption, “... one of the best moments of my life.”


  Though she never envisioned herself competing in pageants, Taylor said she’s had “more fun than I ever thought I would,” adding that it has helped her gain new confidence, particularly when it comes to speaking.


  Her newfound speaking skills led Taylor to change her major at LSU from engineering to mass communications, something she credits to pageants.


  “I never expected any of this to happen,” she said. “But once I started doing pageants, I realized it was really fun. I love the competition part of it, and it’s made me such a better speaker and communicator and that has given me so much more confidence. So I really appreciate what it’s done for me already.


  “Pageants are a lot like sports, honestly, because when you’re there, it really is a competition. It feels like I’m in a game, so it’s worked out perfectly.”


  Taylor’s reign as Miss Teen Louisiana has been much different from her predecessors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which limited the number of public appearances she was able to do. She did, however, get to enjoy a sendoff party at her parents’ home in mid-October.


  “It was so bittersweet because I didn’t really expect that many of my friends to come,” she said. “Of course pageant people came, but then a lot of my friends from school and high school came and it was very fun to hang out with all of them. For them to be there for me meant so much.”


  Taylor said she’s been surprised at the outpouring of support she’s received as the competition pageant draws closer. On the morning she had her Miss Teen USA interview with the judges, Taylor said her phone buzzed “constantly” with all the well-wishers sending their support.


  “It means so much to me because I didn’t realize how many people I had behind me,” she said. “But when I started getting all these texts and calls, it really just meant so much.


  “I’m just so grateful to have this opportunity, no matter how I got it. It’s been such a blessing for me, and I’m really excited to see how I do.”

With Bastian Schweinsteiger as his role model, Joshua Kimmich is following in his idol s footsteps at Bayern Munich by becoming the driving force of the European nbsp champions. Kimmich will be at the heart of Bayern s midfield on Tuesday when they make the trip over the Alps to face Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League. Kimmich has evolved from a right back into an uncompromising defensive midfielder, whose full blooded challenges often win back possession to counter attack. After Bayern conceded an equaliser at Lokomotiv Moscow last Tuesday, it was Kimmich who stepped up and hit the second half winner from outside the area. The 2 1 victory in Moscow preserved Bayern s 13 match winning streak in the Champions League and for head coach Hansi Flick, Kimmich sums up Bayern s fighting spirit. His mentality is very special. He is well on his way to being one of the players that shape this club, said Flick after Kimmich scored the winner in September s German Super Cup. His competitive nature makes Flick think twice about resting Kimmich. I have to expect he ll be angry, Flick admitted. He always wants to be on the pitch.

FENTON, Michigan (AP) — As the coronavirus pandemic surges across the nation and infections and hospitalizations rise, medical administrators are scrambling to find enough nursing help — especially in rural areas and at small hospitals. Nurses are being trained to provide care in fields where they have limited experience. Hospitals are scaling back services to ensure enough staff to handle critically ill patients. And health systems are turning to short-term travel nurses to help fill the gaps.Adding to the strain, experienced nurses are “burned out with this whole (pandemic)” and some are quitting, said Kevin Fitzpatrick, an emergency room nurse at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan, where several left just in the past month to work in hospice or home care or at outpatient clinics.“And replacing them is not easy,” Fitzpatrick said. As a result, he said, the ER is operating at about five nurses short of its optimal level at any given time, and each one typically cares for four patients as COVID-19 hospitalizations surge anew. Hospital officials did not respond to requests for comment. But the departures are not surprising, according to experts, considering not only the mental toll but the fact that many nurses trained in acute care are over 50 and at increased risk of complications if they contract COVID-19, while younger nurses often have children or other family to worry about. “Who can actually work and who feels safe working are limited by family obligations to protect their own health,” said Karen Donelan, professor of U.S. health policy at Brandeis University’s Heller School for Social Policy and Management. “All of those things have been factors.”Donelan said there is little data so far on how the pandemic, which has killed more than 231,000 people in the country, is affecting nursing overall. But some hospitals had a shortage even before the virus took hold, despite a national rise in the number of nurses over the past decade. With total confirmed coronavirus cases surpassing 9 million in the U.S. and new daily infections rising in 47 states, the need is only increasing. Wausau, Wisconsin-based Aspirus Health Care is offering $15,000 signing bonuses for nurses with at least a year of experience and hiring contract nurses through private staffing companies to handle a surge in hospitalizations that prompted the system to almost quadruple the number of beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients. Aspirus, which operates five hospitals in Wisconsin and four in small communities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, also is moving nurses around between departments and facilities as hot spots emerge, said Ruth Risley-Gray, senior vice president and chief nursing officer at Aspirus.Outside help still is needed, in part because some nurses have gotten sick from or were exposed to the cornavirus during the current wave, which “came with a vengeance” starting in August, Risley-Gray said. At one point in mid-October, 215 staffers were in isolation after showing symptoms or being exposed to someone who tested positive, and some are just starting to return to work.Aspirus recently was able to hire 18 nurses from outside agencies, and may need more if the surge continues. Because the pandemic is surging just about everywhere in the country, hospitals nationwide are competing for the same pool of nurses, offering pay ranging from $1,500 a week to more than $5,000, said April Hansen, executive vice president at San Diego-based Aya Healthcare, which recruits and deploys travel nurses.She said demand for their services has more than doubled since early in the pandemic when the greatest need was in hot spots like New York and New Jersey and then moved to southern states. In recent weeks the virus has been spiking across the country, with the new hot spots in places like the rural upper Midwest and southern-border communities such as El Paso, Texas.Now placing nurses where they’re needed is “like a giant game of whack-a-mole,” said Hansen, whose company has about 20,000 openings for contract nurses.In North Dakota, where infection rates are exploding, hospitals may cut back on elective surgeries and seek government aid to hire more nurses if things get worse, North Dakota Hospital Association president Tim Blasl said. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott recently announced he was sending 75 nurses and respiratory therapists to El Paso to help handle the city’s surge. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, meanwhile, issued emergency orders making it easier for nurses from elsewhere to practice in his state and for retired nurses to come back.“This has been a challenge, and we’ve been pleading with the community members to protect themselves and others,” by wearing masks and social distancing, said Aspirus' Risley-Gray, who said the positivity rate among community members tested by Aspirus rose from under 10% in September to 24% last week.To combat the emotional toll and fatigue that comes with caring for COVID-19 patients, including just donning and removing protective equipment all day, Aspirus has been giving nurses microbreaks and quiet places to get away and collect themselves when they feel overwhelmed. Travel nurses say the need at small hospitals tends to be greater than at larger facilities. Robert Gardner, who’s currently assigned to a hospital in a small town about 20 miles west of Atlanta, said he did search and rescue in the Coast Guard during Hurricane Katrina and the pandemic is “a lot worse.” He worked at a large New Jersey hospital when that state was swamped by the virus in the spring, and now worries that flu season could bring further chaos to hospitals. But he’s determined to stick it out, no matter what. “It’s not even a question,” Gardner said. “Nursing is a calling.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The 100 per cent tariff increase when electricity remains elusive amid estimated billings, though suspended after members of organised labour threatened nationwide industrial action, is to say the least inhumane. For the tariff to have increased from N30.23 for one kwh (kilowatt unit of energy per hour) to as much as N62.33 per kwh was a subtle decision that was well thought out to further assist the electricity distribution companies milk Nigerians before they eventually supply pre-paid meters to customers. Coming under the guise of 'Service Reflective Tariff' to take its decision is most untenable as much as it is unreasonable.

My own perspective on historic statistics
 With regard to the letter [“Something’s wrong with COVID statistics,” Oct. 28], all such statistics should be questioned.
 For example, the 2,407 deaths at Pearl Harbor were the result of “Severe Water Ingestion,” not the Japanese, so we should never have declared war on the Japanese empire.
 The 2,977 deaths on 9/11 were actually caused by “Big Building Collapses,” so former President Obama should never have taken vengeance on Osama Bin Laden.
 And the four deaths at Benghazi were a result of “Lead Poisoning” and Hillary Clinton should _never_ have been subjected to 11 hours of harassment by the Congress!

The air transport sector logged a net loss of ¥349.7 billion ($3.3 billion) in the six-month period as stay-at-home requests aimed at curbing novel coronavirus infections dented travel demand.
 ANA Holdings Inc., the parent company of All Nippon Airways Co., last week reported a net loss of ¥188.4 billion for the first half through September.
 "The outlook for the current year is very severe" and the impact of the pandemic was stronger than expected, ANA President and CEO Shinya Katanozaka said at a news conference.
 People's reluctance to travel also affected land transportation, including railway companies, with a net loss of ¥471.7 billion. Automakers and other transportation equipment manufacturers also reported net losses for the April- September period.
 The government declared a state of emergency over the virus in early April and the declaration was fully lifted in late May.
 A bright spot was the electronics manufacturing sector, with demand for digital equipment rising as people stayed at home. Electronics and entertainment giant Sony Corp. said its net profit doubled to ¥692.8 billion thanks to strong demand for game software and subscription services.
 The information and communications technology sector saw its net profit rise 1.8% to ¥570.6 billion, on the back of increased online shopping and remote working.
 The data were based on earnings for the first half through September reported by 484, or 33.1%, of the companies listed on the TSE's first section.

The Bucs also have to remember Jones ran for two touchdowns and threw two more in rallying for a win last year in the quarterback’s first NFL start.
 The Giants will enter this one without left guard Will Hernandez, who tested positive for COVID-19. He has started every game since being drafted in 2018.
 It could have been worse. Three others starters could not practice on Thursday after close contact with Hernandez but they returned Friday.
 Judge has not said who will replace him but the speculation is on rookie Shane Lemieux, a fifth-round draft pick out of Oregon.
 Offensive line coach Marc Colombo said Lemieux is a tough, nasty player who played a little out of control after joining the team. He’s calmed down lately.
 “What I have seen the past few weeks is a guy that is being more patient, with everything,” Colombo said. “It is starting to translate in practice in one on ones and stuff like that.”
 The game will mark the return of Pierre-Paul to MetLife Stadium. He was the Giants’ first-round draft pick in 2010 and played on their Super Bowl championship team in 2011. He was traded to Tampa Bay in the spring of 2018, and missed chances to face his old teammates the past two seasons because of injuries.
 While Pierre-Paul is looking forward to the game, he wants the right result.
 “We know it’s a Super Bowl team, but at the end of the day, it’s the work you put in,” said Pierre-Paul, who has a team-high 5 1/2 sacks. “Any team can be a Super Bowl team, but when you look at the Bucs, the pieces that we have and the way it connects, people obviously think that we’re going to go to the Super Bowl. But, we’ve got to put in the work.”

WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans are fighting to save their majority, a final election push against the onslaught of challengers in states once off limits to Democrats but now hotbeds of a potential backlash to President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill.
 Fueling the campaigns are the Trump administration’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, shifting regional demographics and, in some areas, simply the chance to turn the page on the divisive political climate.
 Control of the Senate can make or break a presidency. With it, a reelected Trump could confirm his nominees and ensure a backstop against legislation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Without it, Joe Biden would face a potential wall of opposition to his agenda if the Democratic nominee won the White House.

   La mancanza di dati stabili, su come vivremo la giornata di domani, se in un nuovo lockdown e se potremo aprire la nostra attività commerciale, o come sarà il futuro per i nostri figli e nipoti, solo per citarne alcune, non fa dormire sonni tranquilli a moltissime persone. Forse a tutti noi. Solo un irresponsabile non sarebbe preoccupato da una situazione così irreale. Ecco allora che arriva il consiglio dell’amico che è ricorso al farmaco “tranquillante” consigliato a sua volta da un altro “amico”, che gli consente di dormire.

Commissioner David Hinkle had asked the county Parks and Recreation Department to look into purchasing playground equipment for the county, potentially for the Quiet Dell area.
 The department was offered a discount, available through the end of October, that would have allowed the purchase of approximately $70,000 in playground equipment for approximately $53,000.
 Last month, the commission considered but did not move forward on a lease or purchase of property adjacent to county-owned property in Quiet Dell that would have allowed for installation of the playground equipment. Instead, the commission asked the county Parks and Recreation Department to consider other options.
 Parks and Rec Department leaders are expected to present those options Wednesday. According to meeting documents, the playground equipment retailer has agreed to extend the discount deadline to Nov. 15.
 In other business, the commission will:
 — Consider legal responsibilities of the county regarding retirement and insurance coverage information provided to an employee by County Clerk’s Office staff. The discussion may be held in executive session, according to Watson.
 — Consider repairs for a 2000 Chevy Tahoe for use by central garage staff.
 — Have an exit interview and review of the county’s 2018 audit with representatives of the West Virginia Auditor’s Office.
 — Consider the resignation of Donald Wikert from the county Farmland Protection Board, followed by consideration of the appointment of Phil Osbourn to serve out the remainder of the unexpired term.

Dear Kelsey,


  Believe me, I hear those excuses all the time. In most cases, the people who say these kinds of things don’t really understand what a budget is or how to efficiently put one together.


  If you’ve followed my advice, you learned first-hand that budgeting isn’t scary once you get the hang of it. Household budgets don’t need to be about hours of tedious math and complicated formulas. Like most things in life, simple is usually best.


  A good way to simplify budgeting, especially for couples, is by making it a team effort. It’s important to make sure your spouse is on board, and knows what’s up with the budget, because you’re just asking for problems when one spouse is doing all the planning and the other is doing all the spending.

When global electronic superpower Major Lazer launched Music is the Weapon on October 23, one of the most hotly anticipated albums of the year saw the light of day. The date also marked a landmark moment for Indian independent music, because desi bass pioneer Udyan Sagar aka Nucleya is one of the collaborators on it, sharing credits with international powerhouses including Nicki Minaj and Khalid. Sagar enlisted vocalist Rashmeet Kaur s help for a track called Jadi buti, which he produced along with Major Lazer members Diplo and Ape Drums. But here s the thing. He tells us that he isn t really concerned about the international market. Sagar says, I don t know what impact it will eventually have on my career, and I don t bother that much with it because 99 per cent of my business happens in India anyway. And though I have done live shows abroad once in a while, I don t think about them that much either. It s a candid confession from a person who s gained international recognition thanks to this big ticket tie up. Sagar says that its genesis goes back to a year ago, when Diplo contacted him saying he d like to join forces for a track. That s when he was in the process of finishing the Major Lazer album, he tells us, adding, I think, and this is completely my guess, that there is a certain level of uniqueness in my music that he likes, which is why he wanted to collaborate. Nucleya at a live show That uniqueness comes from taking sounds from the streets of India and churning them in a bass heavy musical mixer grinder, and Sagar has retained that flavour in Jadi buti. The track rises and drops like a Ferris wheel, with Major Lazer giving Sagar a free hand in arranging it. That means his distinctive sound will now find a larger audience outside of our borders. But, again, the musician remains rooted to India. That s where his core fan base continues to lie. They are the ones who made him a household name, and let s just say that it s best not to bite the hand that feeds you.

In the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Tomeka Ray took her 4-year-old daughter, Diamond, trick-or-treating in the afternoon. The girl, dressed as a princess, wore her mask and carried sanitizer, with more of the disinfecting gel in the car for good measure, Ray said, so “I wasn’t too worried.”
 At one home neighbors had rigged a remote treat-delivery system fashioned out of a ventilation tube, with a cardboard cutout at the end colored to make it look like a dragon’s mouth.
 “I like that. I really do. That’s the third house I’ve seen that has that,” Ray said.

Headlining his first pay-per-view, Davis silenced critics who questioned his discipline due to a history of struggling to make weight. He also demonstrated his poise and repertoire at 25 years old against one of boxing’s most skilled fighters.
 “That shot (the final uppercut), a couple of times (prior) he was blocking it,” Davis said. “It was stuff that, me just not going away from that punch and keep testing it.”
 Santa Cruz (37-2-1) remained unconscious for a few minutes before rising with assistance and smiling while sitting on a stool to acknowledge that he was fine. Although he waved to the crowd and walked to the locker room on his own, Santa Cruz was taken to the hospital afterwards as a precautionary measure.
 “I wanted to make sure he was OK,” Davis said. “We fighters, we go in there with a killer mindset at the end of the day we all have families to go home to and I definitely didn’t want anything crazy to happen to him.”
 The fighters exchanged a series of blows in the opening round while standing toe to toe. Davis hit the canvas late in the opening round after taking a right hook to the jaw, but Ramos quickly ruled it a slip after the fighters got tangled up.

A drive through the South Shore paints a picture of a relatively split electorate.
 There's a store that sells nothing but pro-President Donald Trump shirts, hats and stickers in Hanson, but in Norwell there are residential streets with Joe Biden signs in every front yard.
 Mayors in Quincy and Weymouth lean to the right, but every Massachusetts representative in Congress is a Democrat.
 In the State House, South Shore senators and representatives are relatively evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.
 Locally, the region's voters elect officials who run the gamut.
 But when it comes to casting a vote for president, the South Shore and the state have voted Democratic for nearly two decades. And officials say that's unlikely to change.
 "I don't expect the tide to turn. I think Biden will do well throughout Massachusetts, including the South Shore, but he will likely do less well in the South Shore than in other areas," Paul Watanabe, professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, said. "This area has shown over the last decade or so that there are some pockets of Republican support in large towns and small. ... But I don't expect a giant change. I don't expect this area of the state to become a solidly Republican area, by any means."

 In 2016, South Shore voters lined up to support Hillary Clinton in even greater numbers than they did for Barack Obama, who defeated Mitt Romney in his home state of Massachusetts in 2012. Trump won a fraction of South Shore towns in the 2016 election. Carver, Hanover, Pembroke, Hanson, Kingston, Whitman and Halifax all voted for the current president.
 Watanabe said the South Shore has held on to conservatism despite a greater shift toward liberalism in other parts of the state, largely due to a general lack of racial diversity.
 "The Greater Boston area has largely diversified over the last decade. Some of the South Shore has as well, but much of the South Shore has been slower to diversify and remains majority white," he said. "While we see some parts of the South Shore, like Quincy and Randolph, which have seen tremendous transformation racially, we see less of this diversification in other communities and Republican support largely comes from those majority white populations."
 In some communities, Clinton's margin of victory was huge in 2016. She won by more than 30 percent in Milton and Randolph, and more than 20 percent in Quincy, Hingham and Cohasset. In other towns, she just scraped by. Clinton won Rockland by just 57 votes, Abington by 86 and Marshfield by 98.
 In Marshfield - where Clinton received 7,288 votes to Trump's 7,190 - Republican Town Committee Chairman Dennis McMath said he thinks a Republican victory could very well happen. He said voters in Marshfield and beyond are concerned about a lack of support for law enforcement on the Democratic ticket, and said many unenrolled voters are concerned about Biden's alignment with a "radical socialist" platform.
 "I fully expect Trump to do better this election," he said this week. "We have been doing two Trump/Back the Blue standouts at the Scituate Harbor rotary each week. The response has been overwhelming in support."
 Rachael Cobb, an associate professor of government at Suffolk University, said single-issue voters, like those who will vote solely based on law enforcement support, are rare. Most people have several plates spinning at once and are invested in multiple issues, she said, but added that there are plenty of single-issue groups that try to dominate the conversation and pull voters to one side or the other.
 "A single issue could be the motivator for a voter, but then you ask if there is a counter-movement that will draw people out," she said. "The question becomes 'Is that the issue that is putting everyone over the edge? Or is it the pandemic? Or is it the protests from this summer?' There are a lot of competing issues. ... There are just so many drivers this year. In a non- pandemic year, I could see (Back the Blue) maybe being the kicker for people, but there are so many things that could be the kicker this year."
 Watanabe said voters may choose the Republican ticket not only because Trump's platform is aligned with support for law enforcement, but because he's positioned himself in line with other issues important to conservative voters, such as gun ownership and abortion.
 "Many of these voters are drawn not by Trump's personality or character, but because of issues he's aligned himself with. Policies like that draw some voters to the Republican Party almost despite the fact that Trump is the candidate," he said. "Some voters will hold their noses and vote for Trump because he represents some of the values they have, not because they like him as an individual."
 In Pembroke, where Trump was victorious by 289 votes in 2016, Democratic Town Committee Chairwoman Jessica Rushing said liberal residents have stepped up to try to stop a second Trump victory.
 "Our DTC has had a ton of Pembroke residents asking how they can get involved and how they can make a difference," she said. "We've probably doubled the number of people at our meetings. I've seen an uptick in people who may have not made the effort before working to make sure it doesn't happen again."
 Rushing, who is also a selectman, said she hopes Trump's presidency is more likely to draw hordes of Democratic voters than Republican ones, but she's hesitant to make that assumption.
 "It does scare me," she said. "I'm hoping it's driving Democratic turnout. I'm hoping people who may have been complacent four years ago realize that this is not a time for sitting back and letting whatever happens happen. ... This is the most important election in a generation. I'm really hoping for an overwhelming blue wave that shows the policies that have been enacted under this administration are not the values we stand for as a country."
 Secretary of State William Galvin said earlier this month that he predicts a record-setting number of ballots will be cast, even exceeding the 75 percent voter turnout in the 2016 election.

 "I'm hopeful. It seems the level of interest is there," Galvin said. "We had 3.3 million votes in 2016. It seems we will exceed that."
 It's those voters -- newly registered residents or those who didn't turn out in 2016 -- who could shift the tide. In towns where just a few hundred votes or less made the difference, it's anyone's race, Cobb said.
 "There is huge interest, engagement and participation this year. It appears to be cutting across all demographic groups. Young people are engaged in numbers that are dramatically increased compared to previous elections," she said.
 Cobb said there are multiple reasons the 2016 election may not be the best indicator of how people or communities will vote this time around. Just because the South Shore went blue in the last presidential race doesn't mean it will again.
 "We saw depressed turnout in 2016. Some of it because people didn't like any of the candidates, so they decided to stay home, and some people found themselves the victim of confusing changes to voter laws, so they didn't even try," Cobb said. "2016 was, given the protests that happened after Trump was elected, less of an indicator and more of a wake-up call. I think it has had a mobilizing effect."

 # Smokin’ Hot Chicks BBQ coming to Fairport
 Messenger Post Media
 Monroe County Post
 Empire Commercial Construction, a retail-specific company of regional general contractor Taylor — The Builders, is completing construction of the Smokin’ Hot Chicks BBQ location at the redeveloped factory building in the village of Fairport that once held the American Can Co.
 The redevelopment is led by Rochester-based Donohoe Management, with leasing directed by Caliber Commercial Brokerage. Empire and Hanlon Architects teamed for design and construction of the 4,200 square foot interior restaurant build-out located at 25 Parce Ave. and 75 N. Main St., Suite 170. Completion is anticipated for mid-December.
 "Empire is excited to team with Smokin’ Hot Chicks BBQ and The Cannery to help deliver another thriving local business to this growing development," Empire President Jayne Penepent said.

Kris Jenner speaks up about Kendall Jenner's birthday, 'There will always be hate spewed everywhere'
 Kris Jenner cleared the air regarding her daughter Kendall Jenner's Halloween- themed birthday bash that had blown internet in fury.  
 The Kardashian-Jenner's family matriarch said they took every necessary precaution at the event.
 Appearing on Andy Cohen's Monday’s episode of _Always Unpredictable,_ Kris revealed that all the guests were in fact tested for COVID-19 before being allowed to enter the party venue.  
 “At Kendall’s everyone got tested before they walked in the door and they had to wait a half an hour until the results were in,” Kris said adding, that “everyone was tested … a few days before Halloween, so we were really responsible.”
 She continued, “We make sure that everyone in our family and our closest friends are tested religiously so, you know, we do what we can. We try to follow the rules and if people are commenting and they’re being critical, I can’t control that. I just can control how we behave and, you know, try to do the best we can.”
 The momager further said that she and her family members are tested during the filming of their reality show on a regular basis.
 “We are very lucky to work in an industry where we get tested once or twice a week … because of the network rules while we’re filming as you know, so that’s very strict,” she said.
 Adding that there will always be negativity and hate spewed everywhere, no matter how hard they try to do the right thing, Kris revealed, “We live our lives trying to be just really good people … and we’re dealing with lots of people that have different opinions and all we can do is live our lives the best way we know how and be responsible and do the right thing and we’re doing that exactly."

That’s the thing, save for a blowout against Cleveland last month, Pittsburgh has been more decent than dominant.


  Yet they matched the 1978 team’s mark for the best start ever on a day they were outgained by 236 yards, were frequently pushed around in the trenches on both sides of the ball and spent the first half on the receiving end of the kind of physical beating they typically dole out.


  Coach Mike Tomlin repeatedly chastised his club for miscues while at the same time praising its perseverance.


  “I am proud of these guys,” Tomlin said. “I am proud of the fight. I am proud of how they supported one another. But it is important that we don’t lie to ourselves. We did not function well in a lot of ways.”


  Yet in the end, it didn’t matter, not with the defense making up for in splash what it lacked in sturdiness.


  Pittsburgh forced Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson into a career-high four turnovers while getting contributions from players that were nowhere near the top of the depth chart in early September.


  Inside linebacker Rob Spillane began his second career start with a pick-6 on Jackson on the game’s first series. Rookie outside linebacker Alex Highsmith — who played as a defensive end in college at Charlotte — stepped in front of a pass by Jackson on Baltimore’s first possession of the second half to set up a touchdown reception by Ebron, the spark that helped Pittsburgh claw out of a 10-point deficit.


  When veteran defensive lineman Tyson Alualu exited early with an injury, second-year player Isaiah Buggs overcame some early wobbles to record five tackles, one less than he had in his previous 14 appearances combined.


  It’s why quarterback Ben Roethlisberger took offense when asked what the impact of players not normally called on to make plays starts making plays.


  “I would say, ‘Says who?’” Roethlisberger said. “Who says they’re not supposed to make big plays? We expect big things from everybody. ... It’s fun to see everyone contribute. That’s what makes this team special. Everyone does it. Everyone helps each other out.”


  The Steelers have needed to rely on that depth repeatedly and are now entering a user-friendly stretch of their schedule. After three straight games against teams that were a combined 14-2 at kickoff, Pittsburgh’s next three opponents — Dallas, Cincinnati and Jacksonville — are 5-17-1 before Baltimore visits Heinz Field on Thanksgiving night.


  The chance of stubbing their toe is always there, but if the Steelers have proven one thing over the last two months, it’s that they can stumble without falling.

The third set saw Mott get out to an 8-5 start in hopes of forcing a fourth set. Stepp decided to call a timeout and get his team to break out of their slump.
 “They weren’t hungry. They stepped on the floor for the third set and acted like the match was already in the bag,” Stepp said of calling the timeout. “One thing we have always tried to stress is being ready for what is next. It doesn’t matter what we have done, it matters what we do next. We just needed a reset and to get focused.”
 Out of the timeout, Avondale turned the tide and scored 14 of the next 17 points to go up 19-11 and never look back.
 Along with Beckas, sophomore Laila Hammond was very impactful at the net for Avondale on Monday.
 The Yellow Jackets advance to Wednesday’s district semifinal at Mott, where they will face Troy at 5 p.m. The two met early in the season, with the Colts picking up a sweep of the Yellow Jackets.
 “It was a walkover match (for Troy) and a lot of our girls were pretty upset with how we played, so we are excited for a chance to face them again and show what we are capable of,” Stepp said. “We are very young. We have four sophomores and a freshman. We have just one senior on the team starting right now. With that young group, there is a lot of hunger and speed on the court. They play with a tenacity you really like as a coach and I am hoping to see that on Wednesday.”

KID filed a motion for contempt last week asserting that OWRD has still not complied fully with the order.
 “While OWRD says there is not going to be stored water released from UKL during the next several months, there is nothing OWRD has done that would stop Reclamation, or anyone else, from diverting stored water from UKL without a water right at any time,” the motion read.
 KID executive director Gene Souza, in an accompanying declaration to the motion, wrote that he had not observed anyone from OWRD reviewing or approving of Reclamation’s operations plans or communicating that the Bureau could not release stored water for in-stream purposes without a water right. He also said OWRD was not present at any Reclamation meetings discussing the future needs of the Klamath River.
 “By virtue of my position with KID, I would know if OWRD were making decisions that controlled how water is distributed from UKL,” Souza wrote. “To date, I am not aware of OWRD making any decision on how water in UKL is distributed.”
 KID counsel Nathan Rietmann chalked it up to a shift in who controls the water source for the Klamath River and the Klamath Project.
 Rietmann said the system of water allocation in the Klamath Basin drastically changed in 2014. The outcome of KID’s 2018 court case ordered OWRD to take over apportioning stored water from Upper Klamath Lake instead of Reclamation, based on a 2014 ruling. Now, Rietmann said Reclamation only has the authority to store water for the benefit of the Klamath Project, and OWRD determines how to distribute that water to individual users.
 “People haven’t come to terms with it yet, because it’s been the other way so long,” Rietmann said.
 The new system of water allocation may bring up conflicts between state and federal law in the future, however, if downriver tribes who retain treaty rights to take fish from the Klamath River don't receive adequate stream flows to support those fisheries.
 Had those tribes participated in the Klamath Basin Adjudication, Rietmann said OWRD would have been able to determine whether or not to release stored water in a manner consistent with Oregon water law. The order may imply that OWRD has no findings to make a determination to allocate water for downriver tribes and must stop those flows.
 The Yurok Tribe filed a motion to intervene in the case on October 16, arguing that their rights as a sovereign nation were not being adequately considered in the proceedings, considering that previous litigation had established reserved water rights that include Klamath Project water.

WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - The Electoral College is written in the Constitution in Article II, Section I.Hans Von Spakovsky from The Heritage Foundation believes the Founding Fathers got it right.“They were afraid that if you had a president elected based simply on the national popular vote, the candidates would simply go to the big cities, the big urban areas, and they would ignore the smaller states, the more rural areas of the country,” Von Spakovsky explained.In 48 states and Washington, D.C., the winner of the popular vote in that state gets all the electoral votes for the state.Maine and Nebraska allocate two electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote in that state and one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district. There are two congressional districts in Maine and three in Nebraska.A candidate needs at least 270 out of 538 electoral votes to win the election.Five times in U.S. history, the winner of the presidential election did not win the popular vote – including George W. Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016. That’s twice in the past five elections, and there is a growing call to abolish the Electoral College.“The Electoral College basically empowers those small and mid-size states over the larger states where the economic activity is taking place,” said Darrell West, from The Brookings Institution. “That is not a sustainable system in the long run.”West supports a direct popular election – meaning people would vote directly for a candidate, not an elector. He said a constitutional amendment would most likely be required to abolish the Electoral College.An alternative would be to keep the Electoral College, but have the states award their electors to the winner of the nationwide popular vote, not the state’s popular vote.So far, 15 states and Washington, D.C. have signed the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact supporting this plan– totaling 196 electoral votes. The compact needs 74 more electoral votes to take effect.Senior Reporter/Executive Producer Ted Fioraliso, Multimedia Journalist Natalie Grim, and Photojournalist/Editor Tyler Smith contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Gray DC.

A handful of states will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the 2020 United States presidential election.
 These are the “swing states”: so called because they will help swing the overall result either away from Republican President Donald Trump and towards his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, or back to Mr Trump to give him a second term in office.
 Most states are not swing states and will not change hands at this election – but safe states alone are not enough to get either Mr Trump or Mr Biden to the White House.
 Here are eight swing states to watch. All were won by President Trump in 2016, but all are being strongly contested at this election by Mr Biden.

Like all amendments to the Florida Constitution, Amendment 2 must be approved by 60% of voters. Florida voters also are considering five other amendments that range from changing the state’s primary elections to expanding the tax benefits to homeowners.
 The effort to get Amendment 2 on the ballot was initiated by Orlando attorney John Morgan, a big fundraiser in Democratic circles. “Income inequality is the issue of our day,” Morgan tweeted recently.
 If the amendment is approved, Florida’s minimum wage would increase on a gradual basis over the next six years for nontipped workers. Under the plan, starting next year, it would go up to $10 an hour, followed by a $1 per hour increase each year, until it reached $15 an hour in 2026. Future increases would then return to being adjusted for inflation starting in 2027.
 For tipped workers, employers would have to make sure that their workers’ tips combined with the current tipped minimum wage of $5.54 an hour met or exceeded the new minimum wage.
 The last time Florida residents voted to approve a minimum wage increase was in 2005, when they raised it from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour.
 Having workers earn a good wage makes them more productive and willing to stay, especially in an industry like the restaurant business, which has high turnover, said Diego Tosoni, a Miami restauranteur who supports Amendment 2.
 Tosoni, who with his partner owns two Love Life Café locations in Miami and is planning a new one in Orlando, already pays his workers close to what the minimum wage would be in 2026 if the amendment passes. Starting salary for dishwasher is $11 an hour but with shared tips, that can get up to $14 an hour.
 “It’s important to have our staff happy and productive,” Tosoni said.

"


  The cauldron, set on simmer for months, is now a roiling boil. Election Day 2020 in Georgia is here, and with it comes all the angst and anticipation we've come to expect in this current political climate.


  Already Georgia is experiencing unprecedented participation in our democracy. Nearly 3.9 million people - more than half of the state's registered voters - cast ballots either during early voting at the polls or via absentee ballot, and more mail-in ballots were still arriving. Many waited in hourslong lines to vote early, and thousands will do the same when the polls open Tuesday morning.


  Seizing on an opportunity to win a battleground state that also features two Senate races, President Donald Trump and Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris both made campaign stops here Sunday - Trump in Rome, Ga. and Harris in Duluth, Ga. Former President Barack Obama is expected to stump for presidential candidate Joe Biden in Georgia on Monday. Jill Biden and Donald Trump Jr. have visited Savannah in recent weeks, with Trump Jr. coming twice.


  Georgia has a front-row seat to what is arguably the most consequential election of our lifetimes.


  The Savannah Morning News spent weeks profiling candidates and presenting their positions on key issues. From statewide and local races such as Chatham County Commission chairman and district attorney, to a referendum and state constitutional amendments, we've equipped voters with the details they need to make informed decisions. No race was out of play, including coroner and public service commissioner. The local political scene was even thrown a twist when a county commission district candidate was disqualified in the last hour.


  Along with stories on the races, we've also let you know what to expect at the polls, where to vote and other need-to-know pointers for the day.


  We surveyed readers to ask what issues were top of mind for them this election, and with those answers - overwhelmingly, the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy and polarization in America - delved deeper into those topics.


  What we did not do was make any candidate endorsements. We've listened when you've told us you don't need the media telling you who to vote for; what you want is to know all you can about the candidates so that you can make up your own minds. That has been our focus since the summer.


  Now we turn the page to Tuesday, when from 7 a.m. until hours after the polls close, we'll be out covering every aspect of Election Day on Savannahnow.com. We'll be behind the scenes and at polling locations monitoring activities, including well after our evening print deadline.


  Expect to see plenty of photos and news of the day on our website and social media platforms Tuesday, and if you see something we're missing, we encourage you to contact us, too.


  You'll get a glance of many aspects of Election Day in the Wednesday morning newspaper, but because of deadlines and the sheer volume of early voters, results aren't likely to be known right away and won't appear in the Wednesday newspaper. In Thursday's paper, look for available results and analysis of races - not only who won, but what the outcomes mean for you and your community. Opinion content and podcasts will complement the wall-to-wall news coverage you'll be getting.


  The Savannah Morning News and USA TODAY, both Gannett Inc. news outlets, won't call national races. We'll rely, as we always have, on The Associated Press for official results. If a notable national outlet does make a call, we'll alert our readers, but our official account will come from the AP.


  Presidential race coverage from the USA TODAY Network will be comprehensive, balanced and accurate. We'll be pointing you to our fact-checking and data- driven content to help you make sense of what is sure to be a flurry of activity for the next several days.


  We invite you to make Savannahnow.com your home for fair and thorough coverage of Election Day, election week and beyond, and to step back with thoughtful coverage in the newspaper, as well. There has been no shortage of storylines lately and the storytelling isn't about to stop now. Stay with us as we cover this critical point in American history.


  Thank you for your continued support of the Savannah Morning News.

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) — Early voters waiting in line at Kenosha’s municipal offices couldn’t miss the dozens of buildings still boarded up in this little lakefront city. They might have passed the post office with its covered windows, the plywood-fortified dinosaur museum or the barricaded jeweler, yoga studio or grocery store.Many of these businesses are open, but they are also hedging their bets, covering up windows and sometimes building outer sets of plywood doors that can be easily shut, like castles pulling up their drawbridges, if trouble returns. With a divisive election just a day away, it’s no surprise they’re being careful.Yet two months after street violence shook Kenosha, far more businesses have taken their plywood down. The music store is selling ukuleles again. Neighborhood taverns are serving cheap beer and good company. People are walking along the Lake Michigan waterfront, even if the winds are increasingly bitter.Kenosha has been battered, but it’s certainly not defeated. “This city is a lot stronger than people give it credit for,” said Anthony Kennedy, an African American alderman.People leave Kenosha's municipal offices for early voting while cars wait in line for drive-thru voting, Friday, Oct. 30, 2020, in Kenosha, Wis.Greg Guthrie emerged from the municipal offices late last week and said he doubted the violence had shifted the political ground very much.“I don’t think it’s changed anyone’s vote,” the 51-year-old mechanical engineer said. “But I think it’s probably increased the turnout.”“It’s galvanized both sides” of the political divide, which he believes has only grown wider.What happened in Kenosha and in other American cities during a summer of protests could be critical to the outcome of Tuesday’s presidential election in Wisconsin and other battleground states. For President Donald Trump and his law-and-order campaign, protests that skidded into violence show that only he can keep such unrest from spreading. But for African Americans, racial minorities and many Democrats, the killings of Black people by police officers, which set off most of the demonstrations, show that America is in desperate need of change.The trouble in Kenosha began on Aug. 23, when a police officer, responding to a call about a domestic dispute, was seen on video shooting Jacob Blake repeatedly in the back at close range. Blake, a Black man, was left paralyzed from the waist down.The shooting set off waves of protests , some of which turned destructive. Buildings and cars were set on fire and stores looted.The violence spiked on Aug. 25, when two protesters were shot and killed and another was injured. Kyle Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old who came to Kenosha that day with a semiautomatic rifle, is charged in the shootings.Rittenhouse’s lawyers have called him a patriot acting in self-defense while defending the streets of Kenosha. If convicted, the teenager, who is from just across the state line in Antioch, Illinois, could spend the rest of his life in prison.He was among a number of armed white men who came to Kenosha, saying they wanted to protect property during the unrest.“As awful as the property damage was, and it was awful, it’s not as bad as taking lives,” said Kennedy, whose district includes the street where Blake was shot. “It wasn’t the left (who killed people). It wasn’t antifa. It was a white boy from Antioch who came to our town and killed two people.”The August shootings have spurred political involvement in Kenosha, with the formation of activist groups and thousands of people signing up to vote.“People are asking some very hard questions and demanding answers,” he said.“The amount of voter apathy in our town is shocking,” Kennedy said. “But in September we had 4,000 new voter registrations” in surrounding Kenosha County, which has some 95,000 registered voters.Those new voters could be politically potent. Trump won Kenosha County in the 2016 elections by fewer than 300 votes, while the city of Kenosha went solidly for Hillary Clinton.A city of about 100,000, Kenosha was once home to a huge Chrysler assembly plant that closed in 1988. Now Amazon distribution warehouses have become major employers.Trump has made the violence in Kenosha and other American cities a key part of his reelection campaign, blaming Democrats and saying violence would spread if Democratic nominee Joe Biden defeats him.“These are not acts of peaceful protest but, really, domestic terror,” Trump said in a visit to the city about a week after Blake was shot.Trump is expected to hold a rally in Kenosha on Monday evening, hours before polls open, a sign of how important he sees law-and-order issues to his reelection.A new poll from Marquette University Law School has Biden leading in Wisconsin with 48% of the support of likely voters, ahead of Trump with 43%. Those numbers that have changed little since the school’s polling in early September. However, the polls also show a jump in Trump’s approval numbers in Wisconsin since mid-June on how he handled the protests, rising from 30% to 40%.Trump’s rhetoric infuriates Nathan Upham, a 23-year-old Kenosha activist who blames the president for not understanding the anger and frustration over racial injustice and police violence at the root of the protests.“You’re painting this terrible picture of the real activism work that we’re doing,” he said. “It’s pretty much a slap in the face.”Kenosha officials are concerned that armed civilians could descend on the city again if trouble emerges around the election, but they see no sign of it yet.“I’m always going to be concerned about violence,” said Andy Berg, a member of the Kenosha County board of supervisors. “But at this point it’s all speculation.”Sheriff David Beth has said people like Rittenhouse inflame the situation.“They came in and their intention was to intimidate, to scare and create confrontation. And they did exactly that,” Beth said in an October interview with the Wisconsin radio station WTMJ. “And we had a 17-year-old who shouldn’t have been carrying an assault rifle through the streets of Kenosha ... I couldn’t have asked for a worse ending to that Tuesday night.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Texas, however, has about twice as many prisoners, giving it a lower death rate. Its rate of coronavirus infections also is slightly lower, according to data from the Marshall Project. Florida’s 16,483 infections are virtually the same total as in the federal prison system, which houses nearly twice as many inmates.
 Florida prisoners are being infected and dying at dramatically higher rates than Florida’s overall population — more than four times higher as to infections, half again as great as with deaths. That’s despite the Department of Corrections isolating those who are ill and enforcing the masking and social distancing provisions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control. Prison employees are at greater risk also. The 1,313 infections reported among officers and others represent a rate more than three times higher than that of Floridians generally.
 It’s another example of lethal indifference. Prisons are such efficient incubators of an airborne epidemic that the first line of defense against the deadly coronavirus should be to release as many inmates as safely possible. The ideal candidates would be those who have served most of their sentences or who committed nonviolent crimes and pose little danger to society.
 Some states are trying to reduce their prison populations on account of COVID-19, but not Florida. The Department of Corrections has no authority to release inmates before their sentences expire. However, there are others who could.
 Those people are Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Cabinet, who comprise Florida’s pardon board. They have unlimited clemency powers. With minimal effort, they could commute many sentences to time served and relieve the health crisis in the prisons.
 Only the governor can initiate clemency — the Cabinet’s role is to approve or disapprove — but DeSantis appears indifferent to the unique threat that the coronavirus has created in prisons.
 The infection and death statistics are startling, but not surprising. It would be hard to imagine any setting, other than a nursing home, as vulnerable to the coronavirus. Housing conditions are crowded, social distancing is difficult, medical care is spotty, and the inmate population is getting older due to a long-term trend toward longer sentences.
 Moreover, the prisons aren’t air conditioned, a policy owing as much to the Legislature’s thirst for punishment as for any presumed economy. Considering Florida’s climate, captivity in close quarters in buildings designed more for security than for ventilation is cruel and unusual punishment. Without air conditioning, there is no practical way to filter out the virus.
 The Commission on Offender Review — formerly, the Parole Commission — can approve conditional medical releases. Those are limited, however, to inmates who are terminally ill or permanently disabled. So far this year, the commission has granted only 26 requests while denying 23.
 The federal prison system, which answers to the Justice Department and ultimately to President Trump, is even more callous. According to the Marshall Project, wardens approved only 156 of 10,940 compassionate release requests from March through May. Overseers in Washington then overturned 73 of them.
 The COVID-19 situation in Florida prisons would be worse but for a surprising silver lining. There are fewer prisoners — 81, 956 as of Oct. 22 — than at the close of the last fiscal year on June 2019, when there were nearly 14,000 more.
 Counties sent fewer inmates during July-September than during the same period last year. And county jails themselves report having 16.7% fewer inmates.

The PS5 isn't out for another 10 days, but you can already get yourself this slick custom Dragon Ball Z-inspired PS5 controller. YouTuber and maker of "Custom-designed tournament controllers" LazaModz has disassembled a PS5 DualSense controller and given it a supremely fresh Dragon Ball Z-inspired coat of paint, and it's on sale now.
 The custom job ditches the black-and-white color scheme on the standard DualSense controller and embraces a loud, glossy orange and blue design inspired by Goku's most famous Gi. The buttons have been turned into little Dragon Balls, the left and right buttons on the d-pad adorn Dragon Ball stars, and Master Roshi's kanji emblem sits smack dab in the middle on the touchpad. It might not be the most subtle or elegant design, but Dragon Ball Z fans wouldn't expect any different.
 The best part for Dragon Ball Z fans is that LazaModz is taking orders for the custom Dragon Ball Z PS5 controller here. With a base price tag of $179.99, it definitely isn't cheap, but I can only imagine how much work went into making it look so professional. Another video from LazaModz gives you an idea of what it's like just to take apart the DualSense controller, not to mention the time and effort involved in painting everything. This is definitely one for the enthusiasts and collectors.
 If you need this in your life, you'll be happy to know you can customize it to your heart's content. There's a list of different drop-down options on the product page to add a high-gloss, glitter, pearlized, metallic, or matte finish, and you can also request different colors and design features if you want to switch anything up.
  _ICYMI, the_ _PS5 DualSense controller works on PS3_ _, so grab your copy of Dragon Ball Z: Raging Blast and party like it's 2009._

Check the chicken to make sure it’s tender. It’s been in the crock for six hours for crying out loud, so the darn thing ought to be plenty tender. Unless, that is, you used one of those backyard laying chickens. In that case, you might want to start it a couple days early. And you had better use two of them, there’s not much meat on those critters.


  Season the bird with some salt and pepper and add the mixed cream of celery soup. Remove the lid and cook another hour under low heat.


  Again, we have an hour to kill. I like to start the side dishes now. And you even still have the chance to run to the store again since you probably forgot dessert. Apple pie is a good choice this time of year.


  Once the hour has elapsed, just turn the slow cooker off and let it rest. A final hour should do just fine.


  Now is the moment of truth. Take the chicken from the crock and put it in a bowl. Cover it with the sauce in which it simmered and feed it to the pooch. Then go grill a steak.


  Am I a partisan? No, not at all.

Cayuga County had the sixth-best early voting turnout in New York, according to records provided by the state and local election boards.
 During the nine-day early voting period, 11,140 voters cast ballots in the county. That total accounts for 22.01% of the county's registered voters. Only Richmond (Staten Island), Erie, Schenectady, Albany and Westchester counties had higher turnout.
 Among the major parties, more Democrats than Republicans voted during early voting. In Cayuga County, there were 4,588 ballots cast by registered Democrats and 3,634 by Republicans.
 Katie Lacey, Cayuga County's Democratic elections commissioner, said Monday that the contested races in the county likely contributed to the high early voting turnout.

CINCINNATI (FOX19) - When you see an emergency vehicle, slow down and move over.That’s the message several Tri-State fire officials are trying to get across right now, and while it might seem like the common-sense stuff of driver’s ed, it carries added significance in light of recent crashes.One such crash involved a Harrison Fire Department truck recently hit by someone who is now facing an alcohol-related OVI charge, according to the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office.The vehicle plowed into the back of the truck on Interstate-275 in Whitewater Township, according to Harrison Fire Chief Rob Hursong.“Had that truck not been in the position it was, we might be having a different conversation right now, because there were people in front of that on the expressway rendering aid to people that were injured,” Hursong said.Harrison’s fire department is joined by Cincinnati’s in saying there been one-too-many close calls in recent weeks.“They’re driving through traffic cones, driving around fire tricks... just a lot of, numerous close calls with our personnel and law enforcement,” Hursong said.Harrison firefighter and paramedic Austin Reinert believes distracted driving is partly to blame.“Social media is a big thing," he said, “and they want to Snapchat and send videos and pictures of things that are going on. But we would rather you pay attention and slow down and move over instead of trying to do that, because we all want to go home at the end of the day.”Unfortunately, recent experience proves everyone isn’t so lucky. Three Cincinnati Fire Department ambulances have been involved in separate crashes over the last month, one of them fatal.That crash happened on Central Parkway near Marshall Street on Oct. 15. Cincinnati fire crews said they had been returning from a call when the crash occurred. The driver of the other vehicle died the following day.Police said at the time weather could have been a contributing factor to the collision.The other two crashes occurred as first responders were en route to emergency situations, the most recent of which happened last week on Hopple Street. No firefighters were seriously hurt.“They’re all doing well,” CFD Assistant Chief of Operations Tom Lakamp said. “They’re all back to work, but that is a traumatic experience to be involved in something like that.”That’s why the chiefs of both departments are reaffirming the message to slow down and move over, hoping it can eliminate those close calls — and also save lives.“The key is, we want you to pull to the right and stop,” Lakamp said. “The other part of that, where there are accidents and emergency scenes, is not to be paying attention to that, but actually be paying attention to your driving.”See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

The cauldron, set on simmer for months, is now a roiling boil. Election Day 2020 in Georgia is here, and with it comes all the angst and anticipation we've come to expect in this current political climate.


   


  Already Georgia is experiencing unprecedented participation in our democracy. Nearly 3.9 million people - more than half of the state's registered voters - cast ballots either during early voting at the polls or via absentee ballot, and more mail-in ballots were still arriving. Many waited in hourslong lines to vote early, and thousands will do the same when the polls open Tuesday morning.


   


  Seizing on an opportunity to win a battleground state that also features two Senate races, President Donald Trump and Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris both made campaign stops here Sunday - Trump in Rome, Ga. and Harris in Duluth, Ga. Former President Barack Obama is expected to stump for presidential candidate Joe Biden in Georgia on Monday. Jill Biden and Donald Trump Jr. have visited Savannah in recent weeks, with Trump Jr. coming twice.


   


  Georgia has a front-row seat to what is arguably the most consequential election of our lifetimes.


   


  The Savannah Morning News spent weeks profiling candidates and presenting their positions on key issues. From statewide and local races such as Chatham County Commission chairman and district attorney, to a referendum and state constitutional amendments, we've equipped voters with the details they need to make informed decisions. No race was out of play, including coroner and public service commissioner. The local political scene was even thrown a twist when a county commission district candidate was disqualified in the last hour.


   


  Along with stories on the races, we've also let you know what to expect at the polls, where to vote and other need-to-know pointers for the day.


   


  We surveyed readers to ask what issues were top of mind for them this election, and with those answers - overwhelmingly, the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy and polarization in America - delved deeper into those topics.


   


  What we did not do was make any candidate endorsements. We've listened when you've told us you don't need the media telling you who to vote for; what you want is to know all you can about the candidates so that you can make up your own minds. That has been our focus since the summer.


   


  Now we turn the page to Tuesday, when from 7 a.m. until hours after the polls close, we'll be out covering every aspect of Election Day on Savannahnow.com. We'll be behind the scenes and at polling locations monitoring activities, including well after our evening print deadline.


   


  Expect to see plenty of photos and news of the day on our website and social media platforms Tuesday, and if you see something we're missing, we encourage you to contact us, too.


   


  You'll get a glance of many aspects of Election Day in the Wednesday morning newspaper, but because of deadlines and the sheer volume of early voters, results aren't likely to be known right away and won't appear in the Wednesday newspaper. In Thursday's paper, look for available results and analysis of races - not only who won, but what the outcomes mean for you and your community. Opinion content and podcasts will complement the wall-to-wall news coverage you'll be getting.


   


  The Savannah Morning News and USA TODAY, both Gannett Inc. news outlets, won't call national races. We'll rely, as we always have, on The Associated Press for official results. If a notable national outlet does make a call, we'll alert our readers, but our official account will come from the AP.


   


  Presidential race coverage from the USA TODAY Network will be comprehensive, balanced and accurate. We'll be pointing you to our fact-checking and data- driven content to help you make sense of what is sure to be a flurry of activity for the next several days.

Bottom line is you will have a lot of ruined shots simply because the stage lighting is constantly changing and moving all over the place. So here is what you can do:

BAYRAKLI, Turkey — Rescuers pulled two children from the rubble in a town in Turkey on Monday, delivering hope nearly three days after a major earthquake hit the Aegean, killing 93 people and ruining dozens of buildings.
 Three-year-old Elif Perincek was rescued 65 hours after the 7.0-magnitude quake left a trail of destruction in western Turkey and eastern Greece on Friday, Turkey’s AFAD emergency authority said.
 Local media showed a video of a little girl wrapped up in a foil blanket quickly taken to safety in the coastal town of Bayrakli — the hardest hit by the disaster — as rescue workers broke into applause.
 Hours later, Turkish state television showed images of the girl, her right eye closed by a purple bruise, waving to the camera from her hospital bed, a doll resting on her chest.
 Muammer Celik, a fireman who found and saved Elif, told AFP he thought the toddler was dead when he saw her lying on her back, covered by white dust.
 “I asked for a body bag. I wanted to wipe the dust from her face and put out my hand towards her — and then suddenly she grabbed my thumb,” he recalled.
 “We froze. We were crying with joy,” Celik said. “We forgot everything in that moment!”
 A photo of Elif holding Celik’s hand went viral in Turkey. The fireman said she did not let go until she was taken to a tent for safety nearby.
 Elif was the 106th person pulled out alive from collapsed buildings in Bayrakli and surrounding towns and cities in western Turkey.
 Her mother and three siblings were pulled out on Saturday night, although her rescued brother later died, the TRT state broadcaster said.


 Rising toll


 AFAD also reported the rescue of 14-year-old Idil Sirin in Bayrakli, 58 hours after the quake hit.
 But the Sirin family’s joy was brief as the lifeless body of Idil’s sister, Ipek, was found, the Hurriyet newspaper reported.
 “I can’t hear any sounds from my sister, she’s dead,” Idil told rescuers as she was being pulled out, Hurriyet said.
 Turkey’s toll from the quake is continuing to rise, with AFAD reporting 91 dead.
 Nearly 1,000 people were injured and more than 150 were still in hospital.
 Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that 10 of the wounded were in intensive care, including three in a critical condition.
 Two teenagers were also killed on their way home from school on the Greek island of Samos, near the epicentre of the quake.


 ‘Can anyone hear me?’


 Racing against time, rescue workers were pressing ahead with their desperate search for survivers in western Turkey more than 72 hours after disaster struck.
 “Can anyone hear me,” one rescue worker cried through a megaphone down into the rubble.
 “If you can, hit something or scream,” he called as a drone hovered overhead scanning the rubble.
 Thousands of residents, including those with destroyed homes, spent a third night outside in tents in Bayrakli and in nearby Bornova, many fearing the risk of aftershocks.
 Turkish authorities registered 1,286 repeat tremors by Monday afternoon — including 43 above magnitude four — complicating the rescuers’ works and raising the threat of further damage.
 Launching an investigation into why 58 buildings were either heavily damaged or completely destroyed, Turkish police detained nine people — including contractors — in connection with the quake, state news agency Anadolu said.

Quail season opened October 31 and runs until February 28. But good luck on finding birds, according to TPWD’s annual quail forecast issued in late October.


  Texas quail populations vary from bumper to bust from one year to the next, often remaining hard to hunt following a terribly dry year of meagre hatches. How can that happen?


  It’s really pretty simple. Nature has to add water! And if the countryside fails to receive enough, the usually hot, dry, Texas summer will decimate the quail population.


  By “water”, I mean rainwater. You can’t just take a garden hose and spray water on quail habitat like you would your tomato patch. They don’t make hoses long enough to douse all the potential quail country in Texas’ 254 counties, and there isn’t a faucet attached to enough water to do the job.


  Every few years, enough rain falls to produce a bumper crop. The first year I lived in South Texas, we had a killing drought. Quail were rare. Rats and mice came into town to grab a drink anywhere they could.


  Parks and Wildlife considered extending the deer season to allow hunters to remove more deer to help the remaining ones survive. I trapped and shot more mice in our garage than I’d ever seen before. I awoke one night to find a mouse eight inches from my face. We worried about our baby daughter. Then, it started raining. A hurricane brought so much rain that a new lake rose up out of the sand south of Falfurrias.


  The quail population exploded. Driving from Rachel to Rio Grande City, we hit so many bobs that I told my boss I could have gotten a limit by sticking a crab net out the window as we sped alongside the McGill Ranch. That’s not just a “Texas Brag”; we hit dozens. During that season, I had to be treated for a knot on my arm from excessive shotgun shooting! Then the rain subsided. Hanging a shrimp trawl out the window after that might have caught nothing but “love bugs”.


  And that’s where we are in most of Texas, today. Bobwhites are scarce. South Texas and Rolling Plains ecoregions host the highest populations. In West Texas, scaled (blue) quail numbers fell from last year — 14.1 per sighting compared to 25.5 in 2019.


  Quail hunting is a truer “hunting sport” than some others. But it can be dangerous. A respected lawyer was hunting on a friend’s ranch in South Texas and stepped out from behind the brush and was shot by another hunter who was shooting a bird in flight. Another man I know was shot in the face by his


  hunting companion. Neither man was critically wounded. Both were fortunate. It happens with bird shooting, but shouldn’t.


  Enjoy it, but know your hunting companions and keep a safe distance. Wear blaze orange and be willing to pass up shots that might be dangerous. No bird is worth shooting another human. Or someone’s hunting dog.

The council directed staff to move forward with the annexation. Assistant City Manager Daniel Mears recommended expanding the proposed annexation area to include property along Hall Road, filling in more holes in a map of Bowie.


  So far 45 out of 170 registered voters in Hall Station have agreed to the annexation, more than the 25% required, Mears wrote in a letter to the council. But when 14 homeowners along Hall Road are added to complete the map, that representation drops to 24.5%.


  The petitioner will need to get more people on board so the annexation can move forward, Mears wrote. Staff will also prepare an annexation resolution.
