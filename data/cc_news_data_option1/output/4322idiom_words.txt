The captivating story aside, I need to mention another essential part of the game: the fighting mechanics. Each protagonist has three distinct fighting styles, plus a slot for weapons. The fighting styles can be improved with the money you earn and maxed out by both improving your respective businesses (real estate with Kiryu and managing a cabaret club with Majima) and getting trained by the "masters." Each has its own advantages, with a task list (separate from normal achievements), and you are encouraged to try them all out.

If you decide to move on with your business, which is by no means essential to the game, you'll realize that every person you helped or encountered will come to your office and you can hire them. I have played many games, business simulators included, but this way of gaming creates a sort of attachment to the other characters. One substory even involved hiring new staff – at a point where you desperately need them – but while you end up only getting one new hire, the story makes you feel things.

Many Americans have fallen on hard times. As of May 2020, 47.2% were jobless, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even before the coronavirus tanked the economy, a study conducted by Martha Ross and Nicole Bateman of the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program in 2019 found that 44% of U.S. workers held low-wage jobs paying average annual wages of $18,000. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lists the 2020 poverty line, the minimum income required for people to meet their basic needs, at $12,760, adding $4,480 for each additional family member. The majority of the 53 million Americans working in low-wage jobs in their prime working years, or between about 25 to 54, Brookings also noted. Low-wage jobs represent between one-third to two-thirds of all jobs in the country's almost 400 metropolitan areas, the study found.

Since the body can replenish the plasma proteins and fluid extracted during each donation within 24-48 hours, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes up to two donations within a seven-day period, with at least one day between donations and a maximum of 104 donations per year. Each donor is able to donate an average of 660 to 880 milliliters of plasma per session, depending on their weight. The most common short-term side effects after donation include weakness, bruising, dehydration and lightheadedness or fainting. However, few studies have been done on the effect habitual donation has on donors’ health. “For a majority of people – apparently – it’s relatively safe. We really don’t know what the long-term effects because it’s a relatively new phenomenon,&quot; Dr. Roger Kobayashi, a clinical professor of immunology at UCLA, told ABC News.

My personal preference is a quick style, a bit of "spamming" the enemy, which is why I love the Rush style with Kiryu and Majima's Slugger and Breaker. The weapons mentioned beforehand have a very low count of usage and need to be repaired/reloaded by an unlockable merchant. As it is not so easy to just stroll into any old shop to buy a shotgun or alike (GTA comes to mind) you are either forced to seek out the merchant and continue in that part of the substories or focus on your desired style. Especially in the finale, you will appreciate either investment.

For an open-world game, the map is pretty small, but after the initial disappointment of having very few spots to discover and seeing that the story gives you the option to grow a business (as a civilian), that small map starts to seem more vast to you than it actually is. Small yet dense, it invites you to wander the streets and savor every corner. As a bonus, exploration is rewarded with many side-quests that are called substories that you can play too. You get to know the regular shop clerk and help them in their endeavors or bring back the game that was stolen from a small kid. These small endearing stories sprinkled in the streets are well thought out, and may even make you laugh out loud by the end.
