Even if new case counts remain steady, Texas has a long way to go toward reducing the rate of viral transmission as other states have done. New York, for example, has reported an average of roughly 700 new cases per day in recent weeks, after an April peak of more than 12,000.

Associated Press photographers have captured an element of life that has quickly become almost universal amid the pandemic: the face mask.
 From Hong Kong to Havana, from Jerusalem’s Old City to the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, you’ll find them.
 We wear them on the runway, or running to first base. While playing the drums, or feeding the pigeons, or riding a horse. Some sparkle, and some make us chuckle. Some cover the faces of world leaders.
 Some of those wearing masks adapted quickly. Others took time to accept them as necessary, and yet more question whether they really are needed, despite medical evidence that they help prevent the coronavirus from spreading. All are wondering how much longer they’ll remain nearly ubiquitous in public life.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Mel Gibson spent a week in a Los Angeles hospital in April after testing positive for COVID-19, his representative said Friday.
 The 64-year-old actor and director has completely recovered and is doing “great” according to the rep. He also said Gibson has tested negative “numerous times” since then.
 Gibson is the latest in a long string of high profile figures to go public with coronavirus diagnoses and recoveries including Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, George Stephanopoulos and the singer Pink.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and even be fatal.
 The U.S. has more than 4 million known cases of the coronavirus, with more than 140,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As then-Vice President Joe Biden left the West Wing each evening to head home, he often popped his head into national security adviser Susan Rice’s nearby suite of offices to check in — sometimes on pressing foreign policy matters, sometimes just to shoot the breeze.
 “My favorite unannounced visitor was Vice President Joe Biden,” Rice wrote in her book “Tough Love.”
 In those casual visits, as well as in daily national security briefings, Biden and Rice forged an easy working relationship, according to people who worked alongside them during their eight years in the Obama administration. It’s that personal relationship, and Biden’s firsthand knowledge of how Rice would operate in close proximity to a president, that are now seen as among her strongest attributes as Biden considers her to be his running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket.
 Rice was initially seen as a surprise candidate for the role. The 55-year-old has a long pedigree in foreign policy, but has never held elected office. She is close to former President Barack Obama and his network of policy and political advisers, but has a lower public profile than other women Biden is considering. She has also been a lightning rod for criticism from Republicans, who contend she put politics ahead of national security.
 Yet Rice has quietly gained support among some Democrats in recent weeks as Biden’s advisers grapple with the enormity of what he would inherit if he defeats President Donald Trump in November. Rice is seen as a No. 2 who could shoulder much of the early workload on foreign policy while Biden focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and reviving the economy.
 And though Rice briefly flirted with running for Senate from Maine this year, she’s seen as less likely to be eyeing the presidency herself — a bonus among some Biden advisers who worry about speculation that the 77-year-old Biden might only serve one term if elected. Some of Rice’s supporters also note she didn’t challenge Biden for the Democratic nomination in 2020, drawing a pointed contrast with Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, who have also been vetted for the No. 2 spot.

Rian was one of eight children of John and Solveig Rian. He grew up in Kenmore and went to Bothell High School.
 He was married for 62 years to Suzanne, who was one of Bothell's first female police officers.
 Son Mike remembers hanging out as a kid at the police station, and the fire station, "where my dad was a lot."
 "I remember him doing shift work around the clock (for the fire department) while he was doing his other job," Mike Rian said. "That's a hard thing to do and a pretty significant commitment."
 Some of Mike's fondest recollections are when his father would pick up legendary Seattle clowns J.P. Patches and Gertrude for appearances in local parades.
 "Our vehicle was in the parades, which was an old Model A truck that converted into a fire truck," said Mike Rian, who got to go along and, like his father, dressed up as a clown for the events. "We were the total rebels of the parades. My dad and his buddies — all firefighters — were notorious for never going by what the parade person told them to do. 'Here's your slot in the parade.' Nah. As soon as the parade started, we would just go up and down the entire parade, spraying people and throwing candy to the kids."

“They’ve worked together closely on some of the most delicate issues a president has to deal with, on literally war and peace,” said Denis McDonough, who served as Obama’s chief of staff.
 People who worked with Biden and Rice, some of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss private meetings and conversations, described them as something of an odd couple. Rice is seen as highly disciplined and can be brusque in meetings and deliberations. Biden, a lifelong politician, is verbose and more likely to make emotional connections even with strangers.
 They were sometimes on opposite sides of foreign policy debates within the Obama administration, including during the Arab Spring. Rice advocated aggressively at the United Nations for authorization to stand up a no-fly zone and launch airstrikes in Libya; Biden has said he argued strongly against the campaign.
 Both prided themselves on their willingness to give Obama blunt, unvarnished advice — and respected that about each other, according to the people who worked with them. But Biden and Rice also developed a lighter relationship, bantering back and forth in meetings and in the after-hours visits in Rice’s offices.
 “They developed this kind of mutual respect, but also casual nature to their relationship that he didn’t have with everybody,” Rhodes said.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a commercial fisherman who was clinging to a cooler in the Gulf of Mexico after his boat capsized, the day after evacuating a boy and his father from the same vessel.
 The agency received an emergency alert at 8:56 a.m. Thursday from the Jenny Lynn, broadcasting its location, according to a news release.
 A MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew dispatched from Air Station Clearwater found Robert Heart, 48, clinging to a cooler in 3 to 4-foot (1-1.2 meter) seas. He was still near the 36-foot (10.9-meter) boat, which was almost entirely under the surface.
 A rescue swimmer helped Heart into a cage that was hoisted into a helicopter, whose crew took him to a Tampa hospital for a medical evaluation. His condition was not immediately known.
 Heart had declined help a day earlier, when the Coast Guard Cutter Diamondback responded to the Jenny Lynn to medically evacuate a 15-year-old boy who had fallen ill onboard. That crew took the boy and his father to the Sector St. Petersburg base.
 Heart told the crew Wednesday that the boat was no longer working under its own power and that a sister vessel was on its way to help.
 The Coast Guard is now investigating what went wrong on the boat's ill-fated trip.

NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — An Oklahoma man arrived in court Friday for a preliminary hearing on murder charges for allegedly driving his pickup truck into a high school cross-country team in suburban Oklahoma City, killing three members.
 Max Leroy Townsend, 57, faces three counts of second-degree murder in Cleveland County District Court for the February deaths of Yuridia Martinez, 16, Rachel Freeman, 17, and Kolby Crum, 18, in Moore. He also faces charges of leaving the scene of a fatal accident and leaving the scene of an accident with injury.
 Five other members of the cross-country team were injured when police say Townsend was driving nearly 80 mph (129 kph) in a 25-mph (40 kph) zone, crossed two lanes of traffic onto a sidewalk and crashed into the runners outside Moore High School.
 Townsend previously pleaded not guilty to first-degree manslaughter in the case before District Attorney Greg Mashburn upgraded the charges this month to second-degree murder.
 “He had extreme disregard for human life,” Mashburn told The Associated Press a day after upgrading the charges. “I don't think he cared who or what he hit.”
 Mashburn also noted that while both first-degree manslaughter and second- degree murder carry potential life in prison sentences, the minimum sentence for the murder charge is 10 years and the minimum for the manslaughter count would be four years.
 Mashburn dismissed a driving under the influence of alcohol charge, saying toxicology tests failed to show that Townsend was above the legal limit of .08 blood-alcohol content.
 The day before the crash, Townsend’s 29-year-old son was killed in a multi- vehicle accident in Moore.
