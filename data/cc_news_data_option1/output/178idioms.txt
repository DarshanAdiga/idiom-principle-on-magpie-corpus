Kyle Shanahan is gleeful the Browns passed on a chance to hire Robert Saleh as their new head coach.
   
 The Browns did Shanahan a favor after the 2014 season when they granted his request to leave his post as their offensive coordinator with two years left on his contract because he became fed up with a dysfunctional organization.
   
 Now as the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, Shanahan figures the Browns helped him again by hiring former Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski as their head coach instead of Niners defensive coordinator Saleh. The Browns finalized their decision Sunday and signed Stefanski to a five-year contract Monday.
   
 "I was pumped," Shanahan told 49ers writers Monday during a news conference. "I heard it on my way into work, so I was extremely excited. I definitely have some empathy for Saleh. I know anyone who goes through that process and stuff, we're all competitive, and you want to win and you want to get that opportunity.
   
 "Every year we keep him, we'll be very fortunate. Saleh's going to be a head coach in this league. Could've been one this year. Most likely he'll be one next year. But he's going to have the right opportunity come around for him. It's just a matter of time. I'm just very happy that we're going to be able to have him going into next year."
   
 Saleh's defense ranked second in fewest yards (281.8) and eighth in fewest points (19.4) surrendered per game entering the postseason. Then the unit dominated Stefanski's offense Saturday during the Niners' 27-10 win over the Vikings in an NFC divisional-round playoff game. The Vikings gained just seven first downs and 147 yards.
   
 Shanahan said "it would've been very hard" to replace Saleh.
   
 Stefanski, Saleh and New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels were considered the favorites of the eight candidates the Browns interviewed during their head coaching search.
   
 However, it became apparent Saturday the decision would be narrowed to Stefanski and Saleh because the Browns requested interviews with GM candidates linked to them -- Philadelphia Eagles vice president of football operations Andrew Berry and Indianapolis Colts assistant GM Ed Dodds.
   
 When Berry served as a VP of player personnel for the Browns last year, he supported Stefanski's head coaching bid. Dodds spent three seasons with Saleh when they worked for the Seattle Seahawks.
   
 With Saleh out of the picture for the Browns, Dodds declined their interview request, NFL Network reported Monday.
   
 Shanahan said he let Saleh know how happy he was about the Browns choosing Stefanski.
   
 "He knows me well enough to know how I am," Shanahan said. "But, I mean, I'm definitely excited he didn't get it, and that's not just for selfish reasons. It's 'cause I care a lot about this organization, too. So it definitely helps me, but it helps this whole organization.
   
 "And I think it'll help Saleh in the long run. I mean, like I said, he's going to be a head coach. He just needs the right opportunity, and he's going to keep getting better and better, too."
   
 Shanahan was asked how the Browns' decision will help Saleh.
   
 "So he can be in California for another year," Shanahan said with a smile. "This really helps him save money on insurance."
   
 Was Shanahan worried Saleh would've taken assistant coaches to Cleveland if he had secured the job.
   
 "There's always a concern. Always. I know we've got a lot of good coaches on our staff, and we've been very fortunate enough to keep them around here. But, yeah, that would've been a concern. That would've been a tough part on our relationship. I would've never talked to him again if he did that," Shanahan said with another smile.
   
 Ringing endorsement
   
 Future Hall of Fame left tackle Joe Thomas revealed he conducted research for the Browns during their coaching search.
   
 "Some of the people from the Browns reached out to me and asked if I could do a little bit of homework on some of these coaches," Thomas said on the team's in-house radio show, Cleveland Browns Daily. "I reached out to as many players and coaches that I've worked with, that I know throughout the NFL, that have had interactions with all these guys who were the top candidates."
   
 Thomas said two-time Pro Bowl tight end Kyle Rudolph credited Stefanski for the Vikings' success on offense in 2019.
   
 "He's like, 'If you guys don't hire this guy, you're letting another Kyle Shanahan walk out the building,'" Thomas said.
   
 Movement
   
 New Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy hired Jeff Blasko to be his assistant offensive line coach, ESPN reported.
   
 Blasko worked for the Browns in the same capacity last year and previously spent time with McCarthy as a Green Bay Packers assistant.

PLAIN CITY — There is a narrow country road on the way to Plain City with a one-of-its-kind flashing red light and stop sign at the intersection of 12th Street and 4700 West.
 On the basketball court, Weber collided with a pair of unique, Fremont phenoms who posted a transcendent performance at the crossroads of Harrop and Hall.
 Fremont senior swingmen Baylor Harrop and Dallin Hall sated the strings from outside and, with a little help from their friends, walloped the Warriors 87-44 on Tuesday night.
 Harrop splashed home nine baskets — eight from 3-point range — on his way to an eye-popping 26 points.
 “A lot of the shots were wide open and that came because my teammates were able to find me,” Harrop said. “When Dallin hit a couple of shots, defenses start to get wary and that contributes to me getting open — and everyone else at times.”
 Six of Harrop’s treys came in the second half, including a sequence of three straight possessions in the third quarter as Fremont’s (12-1 overall, 4-1 Region 1) lead ballooned to 53-28.
 Not to be outdone, Hall had a game-high 27 points on nine buckets — five from beyond the arc — and 4-of-6 from the free-throw line.
 “I had to take what the defense gives me. First half they were keying on me, so I was making the extra pass, got the defense moving and got other guys involved,” Hall said. “In the second half it opened up after Baylor hit three after three; then Tige (Voorhees) and Kipp (Calder) and it opened up for me.”
 Voorhees also had double figures with 13 points on a trio of threes.
 Fremont scored 20 points in the third period and Hall and Harrop had them all as the Silverwolves got back on track after a couple of lackadaisical performances.
 “We got in a little funk and weren’t playing to our potential,” Harrop said. “Tonight, with a rivalry game, we were locked in and had a killer mentality.”
 Weber (7-5, 2-3), down nine after one, was led by sophomore Cannon DeVries with 13 points.
 “All five guys can shoot. You make one little mistake and they make you pay for it,” Weber coach Landon Cosby said. “I don’t feel like we competed from the get-go.”

 After a good cry, I remembered missionaries in hard places with people suffering from starvation and disease. I thought of Mother Teresa who served lepers in Calcutta. I thought of Harriet Tubman — a favorite overcomer — leading slaves to freedom in Canada.

Niantic - Andrew Thomas McCarthy Jr., 79, of Niantic and formerly of Springfield, Mass., died Jan. 12, 2020. He was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. to the late Andrew and Mary McCarthy. Andrew, who considered himself a theological scholar, was raised, ironically, in Hell's Kitchen in New York City.      He attended Holy Cross Elementary School and various high schools in New York City before graduating from St. John's University, Queens, N.Y. in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. He furthered his education earning a master's degree in Ancient Germanic Languages from New York University.      Andrew was married for 57 years to his wife, Kathleen. They lived in various New York communities before settling in Springfield, Mass. in 1974 for the next 39 years. His career paths mirrored his passions from high school teacher to adjunct professor to public relations director at several colleges in New York State. He also had tenures as a community center director, real estate agent, owner and publisher of The Springfield Press business newspaper, and owner of the Sail Boat Place. His linguistic skills allowed him to learn more than 6 languages in order to translate their National Epics.      His Catholic faith was extremely important to him and he was a faithful parishioner of St. Michael's Cathedral and St. Francis Chapel both in Springfield. He and Kathleen spent several years ministering in the Marriage Preparation program at St. Michael's and he was a member of the Springfield Diocesan School Board. In addition, he served for a number of years on the Boards of Directors of Goodwill Industries in Springfield and The Mulberry House. He and his wife were members of the Irish Cultural Center of Western New England. Andrew was an active attendee at the various functions of his four children and 11 grandchildren.      After their retirements, they began splitting their time between Springfield and Niantic before moving permanently to Niantic in 2013 and becoming parishioners of St. Agnes Church. He also became a member of the Pine Grove Niantic Association Board of Governors.      In addition to his parents, Andrew was predeceased by his son, Andrew T. McCarthy III; and his siblings, Mary Ann Bartholome and Robert McCarthy. He is survived by his wife, Kathleen; and their children, Gregory (Mary), Krystn Hickman (S. Bruce), Adam (Elizabeth), and his daughter-in-law, Carla. He also leaves behind his 11 grandchildren, Andrew, Delia, Kristjana, Liam, Kieran, Philip, Justin, Anthony, Juliana, Mariana and Bobby.
