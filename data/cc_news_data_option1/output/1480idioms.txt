Sanders, who has said nice things about murderous, impoverishing socialist regimes, says capitalism, which has saved millions from poverty, is about corruption, greed and exploitation.
 He says a populist “political revolution” transforming the economy is in order and has told us how he would go about it. First off, he is going to get rid of millions of jobs. Seven million of those are in the hydraulic fracking business that he misleadingly contends is guilty of water contamination.

What all of this and more comes to is somewhere between $50 trillion and $100 trillion over 10 years, and that’s pretty much goodbye America, but understand, too, that Sanders would save us by shrinking the military and turning corporations over to the workers.
 The idea is to require all large corporations to obtain a federal charter with interesting demands: give workers a right to vote on how much pay they receive; let them have a similar say on 45% of those sitting on corporate boards; and give them something like 20% interest in the corporation over time. Sanders also wants the government to lend a hand to unions in contract negotiations and punish high CEO salaries with higher taxes.

And now to the most hotly-debated Seahawks’ position group as the NFL draft looms ever closer -- the defensive line.
 Improving the pass rush was publicly stated as job one for this offseason by coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider.
 But with just eight days left to the draft, whether Seattle is even as good up front as it was a year ago, when the Seahawks' 28 sacks were tied for the second-fewest in the NFL, isn’t necessarily clear.
 The Seahawks in free agency have lost starting end Quinton Jefferson and tackle Al Woods. And as you may have heard, there is still no resolution to the Jadeveon Clowney situation while Ziggy Ansah, also a starter much of last year, also remains unsigned.
 In their place, Seattle has signed/agreed to terms with former Seahawks Bruce Irvin and Benson Mayowa.
 Seattle also re-signed tackle Jarran Reed.
 The general assumption is that Seattle has one big free agent ticket still to play to help the line -- finally reel in Clowney? Maybe get Everson Griffen?

For the time being, Putin is offering anyone who has been unemployed since March 1 the maximum unemployment benefit for up to three months. However, this "maximum" is in line with minimum wage, which is currently equivalent to about $165 per month. Unemployed Muscovites are only slightly better off, with Mayor Sergey Sobyanin offering them around $265 per month in compensation. That said, many Russians will not qualify for these unemployment benefits. And so for them the economic fallout from the pandemic is often scarier than the coronavirus itself.

Since MCO was first issued on 18 March 2020, Malaysians have been vocal in expressing love about things that matter to them. Those who love money questioned the assistance provided by the Government to B40 and M40 who were already struggling to make ends meet long before there was MCO. Those who love power keep admonishing and finding faults with those who have it, even when they themselves are work in progress. Those who love the country come rain come shine, sprung to actions to help those in need be it frontliners, backliners, homeless, destitute, stranded or small businesses.

Wales were made to wait in their bid to secure qualification for next year's European Championship as Chris Coleman's side were held to a 0-0 draw by Israel at the Cardiff City Stadium.
 The home side knew victory would ensure a first appearance at a major competition since the legendary John Charles inspired them to the World Cup in 1958.
 However, Wales could not break down a resolute and compact Israel defence, with Gareth Bale – so often the saviour – unable to provide a moment of magic, though he came close with last-gasp strike that had Ofir Marciano at full stretch.
 Instead the best chances fell to Aaron Ramsey in the first half when he headed over the crossbar after Andy King's effort had been kept out, while Bale failed to find the target with a free-kick from the edge of the area after the break.
 Coleman's men also saw penalty appeals for a handball in the box turned down – while Simon Church's injury-time header was ruled out for offside – and must now wait to see if Belgium's result puts them into the Euros by virtue of a top-two finish, while Israel still harbour qualification ambitions of their own.
 Roared on by a vociferous home crowd, Wales began brightly – threatening through Ramsey and King inside the opening 10 minutes.
 With Israel often guilty of carelessness in possession, the hosts continued to try to press home their advantage, although Wales struggled to break down a deep visiting defence.
 Israel enjoyed rare forays outside their half, but were more than happy to soak up pressure, adding to frustrations on and off the pitch.
 With star man Bale often crowded out or isolated, Wales failed to gain reward for their approach before the break.
 Seemingly buoyed by their solid first-half display at the back, Israel were composed early in the second half, keeping possession well without forcing clear-cut chances.
 It was broadly the same story for Wales before the hour, although Hal Robson- Kanu managed to connect with a David Edwards delivery, with the Reading man only able to divert it over the crossbar.
 When Robson-Kanu was brought down on the edge of the area, Bale clipped a free-kick over the target before King's header was well kept out by Marciano inside the final half hour.
 It led to another sustained period of pressure from the hosts, with Eitan Tibi perhaps fortunate not concede a penalty when he appeared to handle inside the area.
 Bale, who got the winner against Cyprus on Thursday, was almost the hero for the second time in a week, but saw his low shot kept out by the fingertips of Marciano with three minutes remaining.
 There was time for one more moment of false hope as Church's close-range header was flagged for offside, cutting celebrations short deep into injury time.
 Wales next head to Bosnia-Herzegovina and conclude their campaign at home to Andorra, while Israel will likely need to beat Cyprus and Belgium to make it to France.

“Children trust parents and adults to provide a safe environment and protect them from the dangers of this world. The trust of these children was violated so horribly by the defendants in this case and, sadly, we may never be able to fully repair the damage and terrible harms done to them. Locking these individuals behind bars for the rest of their lives will never erase their despicable crimes, but we can at least be sure they will never hurt another child again,” stated State’s Attorney Tom Gibbons.

Stoke City forward Jonathan Walters was quick to make light of a transfer deadline day that saw him remain at the Britannia Stadium.
 The Republic of Ireland international had been the subject of rejected bids from Norwich City earlier in the window and was reported to have handed in a transfer request on Monday after talks over a new contract at Stoke stalled.
 Nevertheless, Walters did not appear overly concerned as he took to Twitter in the wake of a move failing to materialise, offering a mock apology to Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.
 Walters tweeted: "Helicopter away for the year ... sorry LVG it's not happening," with accompanying emojis of a helicopter and a blushing face.
 The 31-year-old's contract at Stoke expires at the end of the season, although Mark Hughes has repeatedly expressed a desire for Walters to remain part of his squad.
