"So far, I haven't gotten the ball. I didn't even ask for it, honestly," Verdugo said. "It was just one of those things, I think there was like an authenticator or something out there. He probably took it and swiped it, so I'm not too sure what to do with that ball. But hopefully there's many more."

So I just went back to being a little bit calmer, starting a little bit earlier, and I'm starting to see the ball better," Verdugo said. "Starting to put better swings on the ball.

Council bosses have said they have “no doubt” that the Chinese investor behind much of the town centre’s regeneration plans will continue to invest in Bolton despite diplomatic tensions with the UK over Hong Kong.
 BCEGI, an international property developer established by a Chinese state- owned construction company, is one of the firms behind the plans to rebuild Crompton Place shopping centre as part of a £1.5bn regeneration scheme.
 The major redevelopment of the site worth £250m was given the green light, in principle, in July with more details to be approved at a later stage.
 The plans include a 110-bedroom hotel, 150 homes, 10,500 square metres of office space, and a mixed-use retail, leisure, dining and events space, dubbed “Bolton Works”, designed to accommodate independent retailers and food operators and also includes incubator space for small business start-ups.
