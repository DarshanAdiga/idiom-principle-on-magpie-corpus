 Springtime is here. It's the perfect time to take your fitness outdoors and enjoy a great season. And combining your cardio and muscle work makes it even better!
 Our move today is a side-to-side leaping lunge. This combination exercise will be accelerating your heart rate on the side-to-side jumping. And the lunging will be working your whole lower body, focusing on your glutes, hamstrings and quads. All you need for this movement is a clear area to move about. If you need intensity, small hand weights could be held as well.
 Begin this exercise by standing tall, and engaging your midsection for stability and balance. Start out by simply leaping out with a wide step on your left side, following with your right leg. Once you land on the ground with your left foot, carefully swing your right leg behind you (placing your foot steadily on the ground) and lower into a small lunging position.
 Now, from this lunge, you will repeat the same movement going in the opposite direction, leaping out to your right side, and following with the left leg. Position your trail leg behind you in a lunging position on the other side.
 You can start this combination exercise slowly in the beginning to ensure your balance. Once you get the momentum, slightly increase your speed. This will increase your heart rate, get your blood pumping and work your lower body a little harder.
 You can push yourself for a determined amount of time. Or give yourself at least 10 leaps on each side. Take a small break, and start the process over again.
 If at any time you need more intensity, you can hold small hand weights in each hand, tucking them into your chest. Or, if you need to lower the intensity, simply lose the leap and step out to your sides.

In light of mass panic growing among Americans looking to self-quarantine following the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, several stores across the U.S. are forcing limits on items. The latest big box department store taking proactive measures to ensure supply is fairly available upon equal demand is Walmart, who will now be limiting purchases of specific products as a response to panic buying.


  According to _CBS News_ , Walmart will be limiting its purchases of paper products, milk, eggs and hand sanitizers, which have become pandemic staples for many across North America, looking to stock up on the essentials as they stay home and help flatten the curve in the virus' growth. While manufacturers are not reporting any shortages of items in production itself, like toilet paper per brands such as Cottonelle or Charmin, stores are still struggling to keep up with the speed of items selling out, while stocking up shelves in time for the next customers because of hoarding.

When I got my first major record deal on Reprise Records in 1991, I thought I’d finally get a chance to release it. But then Roland and I realized we didn’t know where the masters were. So I figured it was lost. But then his wife found a copy of a reel to reel in the bottom of a box, so what would have been my first record became my 30th record. So I was so pleased that it finally came out.

SPRINGFIELD,Mo. (KY3/Gray News) - Amid the empty shelves and store closures during the coronavirus outbreak, a Missouri Walmart had its own commotion going Wednesday afternoon.A baby was born in the toilet paper aisle of the store.“We were like oh my gosh, is this actually going to happen,” said store manager Jessica Hinkle.Hinkle said the woman warned store associates that her last child came in just 30 minutes. When the woman’s water broke in the toilet paper aisle, she was prepared to go into labor right there.“We were like, ‘What do we do now?’” she said. “Another lady comes around the corner and she says, ‘I’m a labor nurse, can I help?’ And we said, ‘Yes, yes please.’ She had gloves in her pocket (and) she was ready.”Hinkle said she grabbed a sheet and blocked the aisle to give the woman as much privacy as possible.“Crowd control, (I’m) not like the best with blood so that was my job, holding the sheet and crowd control, making sure that nobody invaded what privacy the poor lady still had,” Hinkle said.Springfield firefighters rushed into the store and helped deliver the baby girl."They're the typical fire department that shops in our store, so they were pretty proud of themselves," Hinkle said.She said the entire process took about 45 minutes, and customers were cheering for the woman the whole time.“They took her out on the gurney, there were customers of course gathered. She kind of raised her hand, everyone clapped for her,” Hinkle said.The Walmart birth was the touch of happiness Hinkle said everyone needed.“You know a feel-good moment, everybody’s going through so much, and with a baby it’s like everything comes full circle,” she said.Hinkle said she did touch base with the woman Thursday. She said both mom and baby are doing well.Copyright 2020 KY3 via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

Brady has been with the Patriots since 2000 and this was the first time he's tested the free-agent market. On Tuesday, the father-of-three announced he was leaving the Patriots and signing with another team. Last year, Brady talked about his future in New England and said he wasn't sure what was going to happen.


  "That is the great part for me -- I don't know," Brady said on WEEI's _The Greg Hill Show_ back in October. "I think that has been a unique situation that I have been in because I think when you commit to a team for a certain amount of years, you kinda feel like (there is) the responsibility to always fulfill the contract. For me, it's been good because I am just taking it day by day and I am enjoying what I have. I don't know what the future holds and the great part is for me, football at this point is all borrowed time.


  "I never expected to play 20 years and I am playing on a great team and it's just been an incredible 20 years of my life. To play for Mr. Kraft, and Jonathan and the Kraft family and for Coach Belichick and to have so much success is a dream come true."


  When the 2019 season ended, there was speculation about Brady retiring due to his age and what he accomplished in his career. He made it clear that he still has some football left in him.


  0comments


  "In both life and football, failure is inevitable," Brady wrote on Instagram in January. "You don't always win. You can, however, learn from that failure, pick yourself up with great enthusiasm, and place yourself in the arena again. And that's right where you will find me. Because I know I still have more to prove."


  Brady may still have more to prove, but he's already accomplished more than any player in NFL history. Along with the six Super Bowl wins, Brady has played in a total of nine Super Bowls, has won the Super Bowl MVP award four times and he's a three-time MVP winner.

 The State Government Health Department, along with Railway Health Department, has jointly started screening passengers entering Madurai railway junction.
 Besides taking up massive disinfecting exercise on the railway platforms and coaches of trains, all those entering the railway stations are asked to wash their hands with soap.
 A health official said that medical officer from State Health Department, along with paramedical staff from the Railway Health Department, has set up help desk on both the Western and Eastern entrance of the railway junction since Wednesday.
 While a facility has been provided for hand washing outside the railway platform, all those enter the premises are provided with hand sanitiser.
 The passengers are screened with thermal scanners. The passengers’ travel history is asked and anyone who had travelled abroad in the recent past are asked to avoid travelling. Besides, they are asked whether they had any contact with foreigners or those who had recently returned from any foreign countries, the official added.
 The railway health department has increased the frequency of disinfecting the entire railway premises. Besides mopping the floor with disinfectant, the common touch places like chairs, furniture, hand rails, lift buttons and charging points are taken special care.
 “This work is taken up round the clock. All the frontline staff on the railway premises like health workers, railway booking clerks, travelling ticket examiners and other officials are given masks. Even at the railway offices, sanitiser bottles have been kept outside the offices,” an official said.
 The mechanical department of Southern Railway has taken up cleaning of railway coaches. “Some 300 coaches are being cleaned every day. Disinfectant are being sprayed inside all coaches,” the official added.
 Blankets were not issued to the passengers of AC coaches and curtains have been removed to reduce infection.
 All summer special trains and few express and passenger trains have been cancelled owing to low occupancy.
 As part of creating awareness of COVID-19, posters have been pasted and leaflets on precautionary measures to be taken are being distributed to the passengers at important railway stations.

AFTER looking after her alcoholic mother and doing one year of a nursing degree, a Rockhampton woman turned to using cocaine after being introduced to it while working as an exotic dancer.
 Ayse Yasmin Guldur, 27, was then intercepted at Rockhampton Airport with 7.591g of cocaine on March 28, 2019, along with $450 cash from a drug sale.
 Guldur, who recently gave birth, pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court in Rockhampton to one count each of possessing a dangerous drug over two grams, supplying a dangerous drug and possessing proceeds of a drug sale.
 Crown prosecutor Elise Sargent said Guldur told police, who had intercepted her at the airport at 4.36pm on March 28 after a tip off at 4.15pm, that she planned to sell the drugs to her friends.
 Defence solicitor Doug Winning said Guldur was introduced to cocaine while she was working as an exotic dancer at Hollywood Showgirls Night Club on the Gold Coast.
 He said she moved to ­Rockhampton in March 2017 after a friend got her a job at Zodiac nightclub but left that employment three weeks after these charges were laid.
 Mr Winning said Guldur worked in retail until she gave birth in February and planned to return to work soon, as well as resume her studies in nursing.
 He said Guldur never knew her father, a Turkish man who had a short relationship with her mother and never accepted paternity of Guldur.
 Mr Winning said her mother worked as an assistant nurse in aged care but was unable to work after alcoholism took over her life.
 He said the alcoholism was so bad, Guldur’s mother was hospitalised six times.
 Mr Winning said his client looked after her mother until she turned 22 and moved to the Gold Coast for study.
 He said after a year of study, Guldur returned to her mother’s aid as she underwent rehabilitation.
 Mr Winning said when Guldur returned to the Gold Coast, she started working as an exotic dancer and about two years later, she relocated to Rockhampton to work at Zodiac.
 “Initially, it was recreational, but by the time she arrived in Rockhanpton, her drug use had become problematic,” he said.
 Mr Winning said she had travelled to Brisbane, caught up with friends, and paid $1000 for cocaine.
 He said she sold about one gram for $450 to a friend of a friend while down south.
 The court heard police detained Guldur as she and her partner were walking towards the baggage carousal.
 They found the drugs in five clip seal bags, and cash, in her carry-on bag.
 The cocaine weighed 7.591g with 5.397g pure cocaine.
 Justice Graeme Crow said Guldur should have known better than to even try cocaine the first time given its highly addictiveness, having looked after her alcohol addict mother and studying nursing.
 However, he recognised her rehabilitation efforts which ­included returning negative drug tests and no further offending.
 “You have turned a corner,” Justice Crow said.
 “You have very good and high prospects of rehabilitation.
 “Continue down the same track and stay away from drugs.”
 He ordered Guldur to a two-year prison term with immediate parole. Convictions were recorded.
