MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Hiding evidence that could prove innocence. Planting drugs or guns at a crime scene. Forcing witnesses to falsely identify a defendant. A new, in-depth analysis on wrongful convictions put a spotlight Tuesday on “alarming” rates of police and prosecutor misconduct — one that is claiming lives. The National Registry of Exonerations spent more than six years examining the cases of 2,400 innocent people who were exonerated from 1989 to 2019, finding that 54% were sent to prison because of intentional or negligent mistakes by police, prosecutors and other law enforcement officials. In general, the more severe the crime, the higher the rate of wrongdoing, the report found. The most common form of misconduct involved concealing evidence that could have cleared the defendant — occurring in 44% of the cases that led to exonerations. Next was perjury and other forms of misconduct at trial by police and prosecutors, witness tampering, the use of manipulative interrogation techniques to secure false confessions, and faking crimes, with officers planting drugs or guns on suspects or falsely claiming they had assaulted an officer. “Official misconduct damages truth-seeking by our criminal justice system and undermines public confidence,” said Samuel Gross, a University of Michigan Law Professor Emeritus and senior editor of the National Registry of Exonerations. “It steals years — sometimes decades — from the lives of innocent people.” America has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with more than 2 million people behind bars, many of them people of color. Rates began their sharp upward climb in the 1980s and 1990s, as Democrats and Republicans alike used thinly veiled racial rhetoric to push tough-on-crime policies. The numbers...

La nota precisa que el proyecto está enfocado sobre todo en la población más vulnerable, en particular en niñas, niños, adolescentes y jóvenes en riesgo de sufrir violencia, abuso, explotación, abandono y trastorno psicosocial, mediante una respuesta coordinada y eficaz en las provincias que abarca la intervención.
 Además de las donaciones destinadas a 1,200 familias, se trabaja para reforzar la protección de las mujeres a través del fortalecimiento de una red de puntos focales formada por mujeres, para los mecanismos de prevención y respuesta de violencia basada en género y violencia sexual en cada comunidad.
 Por otro lado, se refuerzan los mecanismos para la protección de niñas y niños, mediante las redes comunitarias, la sensibilización, la identificación de posibles casos y la coordinación con los actores oficiales del Sistema de Protección Infantil.
 Asimismo, la intervención desarrolla una campaña de sensibilización y prevención en la que se divulgan buenas prácticas de higiene y salud para prevenir la propagación de la COVID-19 con una cobertura que alcanza todo el país.
 Plan International, organización de cooperación y ayuda humanitaria que trabaja por los derechos de la infancia y la igualdad de las niñas, en sus acciones de respuesta ante el COVID-1,9 ha invertido más de 60 millones de pesos, enfocando su respuesta en cuatro sectores prioritarios.
 Estos sectores son la promoción de buenas prácticas de salud e higiene, protección de la niñez, apoyo económico directo a través de bonos y transferencias y desarrollo de campañas de comunicación con involucramiento comunitario. En contextos de emergencia ha demostrado que su rol es más relevante que nunca.
 Esta activación se suma a otras acciones puestas en marcha por la AECID desde el inicio de la pandemia con distintos actores gubernamentales, ONG españolas y otras organizaciones locales en el país.
 Las acciones de ayuda y respuesta de España destinadas a paliar los efectos de la COVID-19 en República Dominicana acciones financiadas por la AECID suman ya más de seis millones de pesos dominicanos.

Leroy won a team roping title in the Foothills Cowboys Association, and proved successful as a wild cow milker.

The coronavirus testing system isn’t working. That this should be so, barely a week after many schools have returned and before most students have gone back to university, is extremely worrying. Already, some pupils have been sent home amid reports of queues, mixed messages and rejections from testing centres around the country. Months after Boris Johnson promised that the UK would have a “world-beating” test, track and trace system by 1 June, the “Moonshot” project to deliver 10m tests by early next year, which was announced last week, looks more like pie in the sky as each day passes.

DIVIDE COUNTY, N.D. (KFYR) - Around 60 farmers in Divide County put their own harvesting on hold to cut 1,000 acres for a neighbor who suffered a heart attack after his combine caught fire last week.Lane Unhjem was in the middle of harvesting when he went into cardiac arrest near Crosby, North Dakota.Neighbors, friends, and family brought 11 combines, six grain carts, and 15 semis to get Unhjem’s Durum Wheat and Canola in the bin. When they heard about Unhjem’s situation last week, they immediately started coordinating an effort to help him out.“I talked to a couple of farmers, got their equipment, and then other people just started calling and we had equipment offered from all over the place in the county, and their workers to go with it,” said family friend, Jenna Binde.Those who assisted say letting the Unhjems' crops go unharvested would’ve been a big loss for the family, and helping out was just common sense.“Everybody knows the Unhjems, and they’re good people and good in the community, and just kind of the farming way of life too. You help your neighbor out when they need it and don’t expect anything in return," added Binde.Lane Unhjem was flown to Minot where he is in stable condition, but his family says he has a long road of recovery ahead.It took only seven hours for the farmers to harvest the Unhjems' 1,000 acres of crops over the weekend.Copyright 2020 KFYR.

Thirteen people who are accused of committing crimes while participating in a civil disturbance in Lancaster on Sunday night sat behind bars Tuesday, with bail for seven of them set at $1 million. The eight for whom charging documents have been made public are accused of being instigators during demonstrations over the fatal police shooting of an armed man. Authorities said the protests degenerated into rioting that damaged Lancaster's police headquarters and produced an arson fire that blocked a downtown intersection. Police in Lancaster, a diverse city of nearly 60,000 in the heart of Pennsylvania Amish country, said Tuesday that they arrested five others on similar charges, a group that was awaiting arraignment and to have bail set. The 13 defendants range from 16 to 43 years old and live in Lancaster and surrounding communities, as well as in York, Camp Hill and Mercersburg. Among the eight for whom charging documents were available, not all face identical charges, accusations that include arson, rioting and institutional vandalism. One has been charged with carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. The father of Kathryn Patterson, 20, an undergraduate student at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, said she was acting as a medic, as she has at other protests in the recent past. Chip Patterson called Kathryn Patterson’s $1 million bail, set by a magisterial district justice, “obscene.” “Everything that I know so far, which is not a lot, indicates that Kat is not guilty of those charges. But then again, we’ll have to wait and see,” said Chip Patterson, who lives in Mercersburg, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Lancaster. He said he has not been able to reach his daughter since her arrest. “I cannot tell you how long this night...

But important though this test of the prime minister is, opacity is not limited to a character trait. It is also a policy. Just as ministers chose to cut out councils in favour of private-sector contractors when setting up the test-and-trace system, so they sidelined public health and GP services when they handed responsibility for “pillar 2” community tests to the management consultancy firm Deloitte and others, with no clear plan for how the public and private arms of the state should work together. Time will tell how much this approach has set back the coronavirus effort – and to what extent it has extended the reach of private companies inside the health service.

On April 12, 1997, Kathy married Anthony Zucchi at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Manitowoc. She adored the life they built together and their beautifully blended family they both love so dearly. Kathy was extraordinary; her passion for people and unwavering commitment to achieving positive change within an organization led her to an impressive professional career. In 1980, she began her career with H.C. Prange's as a Clinique sales representative, quickly advancing into department, personnel, and operations management roles. Kathy continued to advance her Human Resources skills at Santa's Best (formerly National Tinsel), where she served as Director of Human Resources until it closed in 1999. She quickly joined the Red Arrow Products team as their Manager of Human Resources until she retired in December of 2015.

Kathy is further survived by her siblings, Diane (Shel) Niquette, Dorothy (Jack) Reindl, Richard (Linda) Naidl, and Jean Naidl. She was preceded in death by her beloved Madeline Blashka. As a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, sister, and friend, Kathy gave her heart and soul to her family and community. She always seemed the find a way to excel professionally, serve her community extensively, and be present at every sporting event, dance recital, musical, or concert. She was everyone's biggest cheerleader and continuously looked for opportunities to encourage others to achieve their dreams. Kathy loved the Packers, cooking, gardening, and all things fashion. She was a season ticket holder and tailgate extraordinaire. Kathy and Tony's tailgate experience was like no other - a culinary celebration in honor of their prized Packers and treasured friends. The family wishes to express their sincere gratitude to the dedicated teams of healthcare professionals at Holy Family Memorial and Bellin Hospital for their compassionate care of Kathy. Funeral services will be held 12 p.m. on Friday, September 18, 2020 at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church on Waldo, 1121 North 14th Street, Manitowoc.
