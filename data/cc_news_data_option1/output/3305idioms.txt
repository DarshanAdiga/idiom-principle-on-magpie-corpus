A spokesperson for the Laramie Human Rights Network told the Boomerang protesters have taken the threat of COVID-19 seriously by wearing masks and social distancing as much as possible during open-air events. But because of the protesters’ urgency calling on council to act, the spokesperson indicated Wednesday’s sit-in was a necessary risk.


  “We have a situation where our local government refuses to do anything about the virus (their rejection of the mask resolution a few weeks ago), so it is very pertinent for these councilors to be faced with the reality of their inaction, that gatherings such as these, with more people and no masks are completely legal in our town,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Furthermore, considering their refusal to do anything about the issues that plague this community with pain and suffering, it must be necessary to weigh the risk of increased potential for exposure to the virus with the immediate threat of these issues.”


  While the once daily demonstrations calling for change have now dissipated somewhat, the message from Tuesday’s sit-in was that protesters are not going away and would not cease making demands for reform.


  One protester, Sam Miller, told the Boomerang Wednesday future sit-ins aren’t off the table.


  City manager Janine Jordan said Thursday she believed the city had been doing the work it committed to in a June 30 resolution regarding a citizen oversight board for the police department.


  “Working together, the City Attorney, Police Chief and myself, have started researching oversight board structures, best practices, training requirements, membership qualifications, legal matters, costs, etc.,” Jordan said in an email. “We hope to share our findings and be able to make at least some general recommendations to (the) City Council sometime between November and January.”


  In light of the demands for reform, Shumway said he’s worried protesters will never be satisfied no matter what council does. There’s a fundamental disagreement, he said, as to whether there’s an imminent threat of police brutality concerning the LPD.


  “Our police are not out using force in an irresponsible way,” Shumways said. “If they were, we’d be hearing about it.”


  Shumway said there’s a concern in the community that protesters on the political left associated with the Laramie Human Rights Network will inevitably clash with people on the right commonly associated with a Facebook group called “Love America.”


  “We don’t need to have a big conflict to resolve it,” Shumway said. “We need to make sure that everyone has a voice and everyone is given the right to enjoy the greatest nation, the greatest state and the greatest community there is.”


  People associated with both groups have exchanged public comments during council meetings of late, but Shumway said how that’s handled in the future will be different. Going forward at council meetings, Shumway said he thinks it is likely public comment periods will be limited to Zoom and the telephone to avoid any future disruptions.

The sturdy and fast Gnabry is less experienced but has been just as crucial for his club this season. The 25-year-old German has nine Champions League goals from nine matches, behind only to Lewandowski's 15. The 24 combined goals scored by them is a record by a duo in a Champions League season.


  “If you look at the way Serge developed in the last years, not only at Bayern but also in the national team, then you have to say that he is close to world class,” Bayern coach Hansi Flick said. “He is a dynamic and dangerous goal scorer, so we are happy … that he is in our team. He is of tremendous quality but I am sure that he is far from a finished product.”


  Gnabry’s improvement is visible from a year ago, when he was scoreless in the Champions League and couldn’t help Bayern avoid elimination by Liverpool in the round of 16. This season he has scored a goal in every three shots he took, and has created nearly two chances per game on average, according to statistical analysts Driblab. He has also become one of the team's leaders in recoveries, with almost five per game.


  Di María scored three goals but was a lot more effective then Gnabry creating chances, with an average of almost three per game in his eight matches with PSG. He also thrived setting up his teammates, with an average of almost one assist per game. Di María didn't play in the quarterfinals against Atalanta because of a suspension.


  What both players have in common is that they will be playing for the title after having their careers stalled in England — Di María while with Manchester United and Gnabry with Arsenal and West Bromwich Albion.


  Di María disappointed in his season in Manchester just after he had been key for Real Madrid in the 2014 Champions League.

ATLANTA — New guidance from President Donald Trump's administration that declares teachers to be "critical infrastructure workers" could give the green light to exempting teachers from quarantine requirements after being exposed to COVID-19 and instead send them back into the classroom.


  Keeping teachers without symptoms in the classroom, as a handful of school districts in Tennessee and Georgia have already said they may do, raises the risk that they will spread the respiratory illness to students and fellow employees. Multiple teachers can be required by public health agencies to quarantine for 14 days during an outbreak, which can stretch a district's ability to keep providing in-person instruction.


  South Carolina health officials also describe teachers as critical infrastructure workers, although it's unclear if any district there is asking teachers to return before 14 days.


  Among the first districts to name teachers as critical infrastructure workers was eastern Tennessee's Greene County, where the school board gave the designation to teachers July 13.


  "It essentially means if we are exposed and we know we might potentially be positive, we still have to come to school and we might at that point be carriers and spreaders," said Hillary Buckner, who teaches Spanish at Chuckey- Doak High School in Afton.


  Buckner, secretary of the county-level affiliate of the National Education Association, said it's unethical for teachers to risk infecting students. Only prekindergarten and kindergarten students are currently attending class face- to-face in 7,500-student Greene County, going two days a week for two-and-a- half hours a day. Teachers are instructing others online from their classrooms, Buckner said, but she said the local school board could soon mandate a broader in-person return.


  Data kept by The Associated Press shows the coronavirus is spreading faster per-capita in Georgia than any other state, while Tennessee has the seventh- fastest spread. A few schools that reopened for in-person instruction in both states have already closed after cases were reported. Gordon Central High School in the northwest Georgia town of Calhoun switched to online instruction Wednesday citing a high number of teachers in quarantine.


  At least five other school districts in Tennessee have given the designation to their teachers, seeking to exempt them from quarantine orders. Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday blessed the move, with his administration saying it would accept the designation, citing the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency.


  That agency on Tuesday issued its fourth version of who counts as a critical infrastructure worker, for the first time saying teachers should be on the list alongside nurses, police officers and meat packers. Such workers can be permitted to keep working following COVID-19 exposure "provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the community," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states.


  "The decision is the district's," the Republican Lee said in a Tuesday news conference. "If they make that decision, we have given them guidance that they must follow if they choose that critical infrastructure designation."


  In Georgia, suburban Atlanta 's Forsyth County has also designated teachers as critical infrastructure workers. Spokesperson Jennifer Caracciolo said that means they could be told to return to classrooms, but said the 50,000-student district will decide on a case-by-case basis.


  A spokesperson for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said his administration is evaluating whether it wants to incorporate the federal guidance into Georgia's legal framework, which could spur more districts to act.


  "We have had some superintendents reach out to ask where the administration is on this topic," said Candice Broce, a spokesperson for the Republican Kemp. "We're in the soliciting-input mode."


  A lawyer for Kemp wrote an email Wednesday telling Georgia's Floyd County district that teachers remain subject to quarantine orders until Kemp or health officials decide whether to incorporate the federal guidance. Floyd County said Thursday it would reverse its designation of teachers as critical infrastructure workers.


  Critics in Georgia say the designation would ignore new health guidance issued to schools that says exposed teachers must quarantine for 14 days, even if they get a negative test.


  Craig Harper, director of the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, a non-union association, said it would be "reckless and starkly contradicts the newest Georgia Department of Public Health guidance intended to protect student and educator health and curb spread of the virus."


  Teacher unions and national school administrator groups couldn't cite examples in other states Wednesday.


  NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia said in a statement that the designation "has no legal merit and is more of a rhetorical gambit to give President Trump and those governors who are disregarding the advice and guidance from public health experts an excuse to force educators into unsafe schools."


  American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten expressed similar sentiments, saying "the Trump administration will always try to change the rules to threaten, bully and coerce."


  "If the president really saw us as essential, he'd act like it," Weingarten said in a statement. "Teachers are and always have been essential workers—but not essential enough, it seems, for the Trump administration to commit the resources necessary to keep them safe in the classroom."

Loughlin’s plea deal with prosecutors calls for her to spend two months behind bars, while Giannulli’s calls for him to serve five months. They will be sentenced in separate hearings held via video conference because of the coronavirus pandemic.


  The judge said at their plea hearings that he would decide whether to accept their unusual deals with prosecutors after reviewing the presentencing report, a document that contains background on defendants and helps guide sentencing decisions. Unlike most plea agreements, in which the judge remains free to decide the defendant’s sentence, Loughlin and Giannulli’s proposed prison terms are binding if the judge accepts the deals.


  They are among nearly 30 prominent parents who have admitted to charges in the scheme, which involved hefty bribes to get undeserving kids into college with rigged test scores or fake athletic credentials, authorities said. Ten parents are still fighting the charges.


  Lawyers for Loughlin and Giannulli had insisted for more than a year that the couple believed their payments were “legitimate donations.” They also accused prosecutors of hiding crucial evidence that could prove the couple’s innocence because it would undermine their case.


  Loughlin and Giannulli's about-face came shortly after the judge rejected their bid to dismiss the case over allegations of misconduct by federal agents.


  The case shattered the clean image of Loughlin, who gained fame for her role as the wholesome Aunt Becky in the sitcom “Full House” that ran from the late 1980s to mid-1990s, and later became queen of the Hallmark channel with her holiday movies and the series “When Calls the Heart.”


  The couple has not made any public statements since their arrest and — unlike every other parent sentenced to far in the case — they did not submit letters expressing regret or notes of support from family and friends to the judge ahead of their sentencing.


  Loughlin pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. Giannulli pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and honest services wire and mail fraud. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss charges of money laundering and federal programs bribery that were added after the case was filed.


  Under the plea deal, Giannulli would also pay a $250,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Loughlin would pay a $150,000 fine and perform 100 hours of community service.


  Prosecutors told the judge this week that Giannulli deserves a tougher sentence because he was “the more active participant in the scheme,” while Loughlin “took a less active role, but was nonetheless fully complicit.”


  The couple funneled money through a sham charity operated by college admissions consultant Rick Singer to get their two daughters into USC as crew recruits, even though neither girl was a rower, authorities said.


  Investigators had recorded phone calls and emails showing the couple worked with Singer to secure their daughters’ admission with fake athletic profiles depicting them as star rowers. In one email, Singer told Loughlin and Giannulli he needed a picture of their older daughter on a rowing machine in workout clothes “like a real athlete.”


  Prosecutors said the couple allowed the girls “to become complicit in crime,” instructing them to pose on rowing machines for photos and warning their younger daughter not too say too much to her high school counselor to avoid getting caught.


  When the counselor began questioning their crew credentials, Giannulli angrily confronted him and asked why he was “trying to ruin or get in the way of their opportunities,” the counselor wrote in notes detailed in court documents.


  After the couple successfully bribed their younger daughter’s way into USC, Singer forwarded them a letter saying she was let in because of her “potential to make a significant contribution to the intercollegiate athletic program,” prosecutors wrote.


  Loughlin responded: “This is wonderful news! (high-five emoji),” according to court filings.


  Singer, who has also pleaded guilty, was expected to testify against them had the couple gone to trial.


  Others parents who’ve been sent to prison for participating in the scam include “Desperate Housewives” actress Felicity Huffman. She served nearly two weeks behind bars late last year after she admitted to paying $15,000 to have someone correct her daughter’s entrance exam answers.

Charlie is 7. Part Basset and part Beagle; he was placed in an animal shelter. Not once, but twice. That means he went through three different homes.


  I can’t imagine.


  Whoever had him first took him to the pound. Two families fostered Charlie from the shelter, but brought him back.


  There are many reasons that people take in an animal and then change their mind, but to me, none of the reasons ever hold water.


  If you commit to one of God’s living creatures, stay committed. It’s not a Buick that you test drive over the weekend and then take back on Monday.


  I can’t imagine dropping a child that age off at an orphanage. But, that’s exactly what three different people did. They didn’t give Charlie a chance. They didn’t stay committed.


  Consequently, at the animal shelter, Charlie was standoffish, sheepish, and didn’t have much hope in his eyes.


  We’ve all seen movies with scenes like this, but this scene was real.


  Charlie had never had a permanent home. I’m sure the feelings he experienced were much like we would have if we were shuffled from one place to another without ever being able to plant roots. I’ve seen this in foster children. It looks identical. And it’s painful to watch.


  The first dog I remember having was named Socks. He came from a litter my grandmother’s dog had. Socks was a mutt that my dad named appropriately. He stole our socks.


  We lived in a small, red brick house on Beech Street where Socks would join my sister and me as we played in the yard. He stayed right beside us, making sure that we were OK, while also being one of us.


  We loved that dog.


  Since Socks, I’ve had many dogs. The last few were rescues. They were dumped in the country and left for whatever fate awaited them. Fortunately, ours found homes. Most do not and meet an unpleasant end.


  Puppies and kittens easily find a home. Older animals, not so much. Which is tragic.


  It’s understandable if someone passes away or is displaced due to a natural disaster, but beyond that, there’s no reason not to do whatever it takes to keep an animal.


  They counted on you. They took you at your word.


  That’s something my father always tried to drill into me: If you don’t keep your word, you have nothing.


  But people don’t keep their word like they used to, it seems. A handshake and a verbal commitment used to take the place of a written contract. And they were worth more than the contract.


  It’s become obvious what happens when people don’t keep their commitments. Look around at the number of broken families and homeless animals.


  A pet isn’t a part-time commitment. It’s full time. You have to go into adopting an animal with that mindset, or you shouldn’t go into it at all.


  Charlie’s three attempts at a home didn’t pan out. But this one will. Our three grandchildren have never had a dog. But now they do. Now they all are a family.


  When Charlie arrived at their home, he stayed in his kennel – still frightened, sheepish and with not much hope in his eyes. But, by all reports, he’s coming out of his shell. He’s beginning to trust. And to love and be loved.


  And that’s what this world needs a whole lot more of right now. Love for all of God’s creatures.


  If you’re going to adopt a pet, be committed. Keep your word. And please consider adopting a pet that’s a little older. They know what you’ve done and they appreciate it.As the saying goes, “They are only part of your life, but you are all of theirs.”

Plenty of returners give Cyclones state aspirations
   
 The Pueblo West High School girl's cross-country team qualified as a team for the Class 4A State Cross-Country Championships a year a go.
   
 With returning qualifiers Aspen Fulbright, Shayana Holcomb, Ginger Hartman, Jordan Moran and Jordan Lucero, coach Bobby Tillman expects much of the same this fall.
   
 "This season we are really expecting a lot from the girls," Tillman said. "They made it to state as a team last year, and we are looking to make a move into being one of the top teams in the state.
   
 "That is going to take a lot of work, but we believe (the girls) are capable of it and excited to be part of that journey."
   
 Joining the returning qualifiers will be Amelia Mamolejo. She will look to round out the core group of runners who boast a wealth of experience.
   
 That experience, Tillman said, will be one of the keys to success for the Cyclones runners this season.
   
 Those experienced runners will set the tone for the program.
   
 "We are returning five out of our top seven girls from last year and we will be relying heavily on them for leadership," Tillman said. "They need to be the example of what being a cross-country athlete at Pueblo West High School is. That includes being a great student, how to executive workouts and how to prioritize recovery -- while having a ton of fun doing it."
   
 Last season, Pueblo West was mere points shy of winning big meets as a team.
   
 Tillman said the girl's experience may prove to be the difference in overcoming those points, helping push the Cyclones to winning meets.
   
 "Hopefully we learned how important everyone on the team is and that every position matters," Tillman said. "Our fourth or fifth runner will have a much greater impact on our success as a team than our top runner will."
   
 Tillman also said that while the veterans on the team are the Cyclones' strength, its weakness will be the split time between the first and fifth runners.
   
 If the Cyclones can sure up that split the team will be successful, Tillman said.
   
 "Our biggest challenge is fixing that weakness," Tillman said. "Cross-country is not the sport for instant gratification. To make growth it takes a lot of hard work over a long period of time and it can be tough to stay focused for that long."
   
 On the boys side last year, Pueblo West was a little green.
   
 Not many of the squad's runners had much varsity experience.
   
 Tillman said that was an issue during the 2019 campaign despite the Cyclones winning the boys City title for the fifth consecutive year.
   
 "Last season, we had some runners that had to step up into varsity positions that maybe weren't quite ready for that role," he said.
   
 But now, a year later, the story has changed.
   
 Led by Trevor Salamon, the Cyclones will be a much more experienced and disciplined team this year.
   
 Salamon, Tillman said, is leading by example and showing the other runners what it takes to get the job done.
   
 "One of our team's biggest strengths will probably be the leadership that Trevor Salamon is displaying," Tillman said. "He shows up day-after-day and is an example of how to work hard."
   
 Isaac Eide has also emerged as a leader for the Pueblo West cross-country team.
   
 Both Eide and Salamon have shown up to every summer practice.
   
 "Those two specifically have been leading by example," Tillman said. "They show everyone around them what hard work and dedication looks like."
   
 In addition to inexperience, the injury bug caught the Cyclones last year.
   
 While still competitive in the South-Central League, Pueblo West failed to qualify a single runner to state.
   
 Tillman said prioritizing recovery time, in combination with harder work, will be the key to reaching state.
   
 "For some, my goal is to prioritize their recovery and understand that they don't need to run hard all the time," Tillman said. "For others, it is to understand that it takes more than showing up to get faster. You have to put in the work and become comfortable at being uncomfortable."
   
 While Salamon and Eide both look to be the team's top runners, Evan McCulloch, Ryan Dehn, Lorenzo Wade and Donovan Elston will look to step up as well.
   
 Tillman stated that their improvement will be pivotal to the team's success.
   
 "My biggest goal for the season is for all our runners to become more confident in themselves and their abilities," TIllman said. "I want them to understand how impactful each runner is on the success of the team and how all of their choices -- from how much sleep they get to getting in those solo workouts -- matters."

BERKELEY, Calif. — An appeals court has allowed ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft to continue treating their drivers as independent contractors in California while an appeal works its way through the court.


  Both companies had threatened to shut down if a ruling went into effect Friday morning that would have forced them to treat all their drivers as employees, a change they said would be impossible to accomplish overnight.


  Lyft told riders and drivers in a Thursday blog post that it planned to discontinue providing rides in California just before midnight tonight, unless a court grants a stay in a pending case. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had repeatedly said its service would have no choice but to stop providing rides in California if the state's law goes into effect because the company can''t afford to hire 50,000 drivers as employees quickly enough to comply.


  The shutdown would have been a major blow to two companies that still haven't proven they can make money, even as they have held down their expenses by treating drivers as independent contractors who don't receive the same benefits as their full-time employees.


  California represents a substantial chunk of both companies' businesses. It accounted for 9% of Uber's worldwide rides before the pandemic caused people to avoid traveling. The state is even more important to Lyft, which doesn't operate outside of the U.S. besides Canada. California accounted for 21% of Lyft's rides before the pandemic, but that figure dropped to 16% during the April-June period as more people stayed at home and there were few places to go.


  The unavailability of the two ride-hailing services also would have delivered another blow to the California economy by taking away the paychecks of Uber and Lyft drivers while also making it more difficult for people without cars to get around. That's why the mayors of San Diego and San Jose, California — two of the three largest cities in the state — joined forces this week urging the appeals court to block the law from going into effect.


  "Being forced into a situation where shutting down service is the only viable option hurts everyone at a moment when we need to pull together to help more Californians make ends meet," said San Diego Mayor Faulconer, a Republican, and San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat.


  Both companies had sought the stay of an August 10 court decision that ruled they must start treating their drivers as employees, not independent contractors, by Friday morning. Both appealed and sought a stay on the decision.


  The companies are hoping to overturn the California law underlying the lower- court decision with a ballot initiative in the upcoming election. Uber and Lyft are among the biggest contributors to a $110 million effort to get the initiative, Proposition 22, passed to rescind the law. Lyft urged for passage of the initiative in its blog post.


  At issue is a decision that could re-shape the so-called gig economy as drivers, delivery workers and others who work for popular apps on an as-needed basis seek improved working conditions and benefits that many in the workforce enjoy.


  Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives predicted losing Uber and Lyft rides in California would cause such a high level of frustration among consumers that it would help get the initiative passed.


  In his ruling against Uber and Lyft, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan P. Schulman ordered them to make the employment classification change for their California drivers, which would guarantee benefits like overtime, sick leave and expense reimbursement. That ruling doesn't affect Uber's growing Eats business, so regardless of what happens with the case, Uber will continue delivering food.


  Schulman's decision followed a new California law aimed at companies that employ gig workers. It says companies can only classify workers as contractors if they perform work outside the usual scope of their business. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and several city attorneys sued Uber and Lyft, saying they were violating that law.


  The ride-hailing companies have argued that they're technology companies, not transportation companies, so drivers are not a core part of their business.


  California officials say treating drivers as contractors harms more than just drivers, since the companies don't contribute to the state's dwindling unemployment insurance fund on the drivers' behalf.

Scams typically target people when they are most vulnerable, and now it seems even a pandemic is considered fair game to those preying on unsuspecting victims.


  A warning issued last week by the state Departments of Health and Aging noted that Pennsylvanians should be aware of scams involving contact tracing, the process of health officials calling people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. Contact tracing is a key step in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, but for it to be effective, citizens have to be trusting and open with tracers. Scams threaten that confidence.


  According to the state warning, callers posing as contact tracers may ask for someone’s Social Security number or payment for tracing services — neither of which are ever a component of a contact tracing inquiry.

The outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI)-Maoist rebels assaulted and inflicted injuries to over 30 residents of Chikpal village in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada district for taking part in the 74th Independence Day celebrations on August 15, the police said on Friday.


  Around 40 Maoists reached the Chikpal village under the jurisdiction of Katekalyan police station on Wednesday night to take revenge against the local residents for wearing patriotism on their sleeves on the occasion of the Independence Day.


  The rebels thrashed them with sticks and butts of their guns, the police said.


  'The villagers were assaulted for attending the 74th Independence Day celebrations and flag-hoisting programme at Marjum village, which took place after 30 years. The Maoists had been hoisting black flags on Independence Days for all these years," said Abhishek Pallav, superintendent of police (SP), Dantewada.


   


   


  He said 10 villagers, including a woman, have lodged a first information report (FIR) at Katekalyan police station, following which a case has been registered.


  "Many villagers were beaten. However, they are not coming forward due to fear of being targeted by the Maoists again. We are sending a team of doctors along with security forces for the treatment of the injured villagers," said the SP.


  The Maoists have other reasons to be unhappy with the villagers, according to the SP.


  "There has been an active participation of these villagers in developmental activities that have been initiated by the district administration. The Left- wing Extremists (LWEs) are facing a gradual erosion of discipline and poor command-and-control mechanism, which have led the junior cadres to target innocent villagers for no rhyme or reason. Besides, several local youths had joined the Chhattisgarh Police last year. As a result, the Maoists are apprehensive that the new recruited police hires are leaking information about them," the SP added.


  Intelligence sources said that in 2014 a Maoist meeting was held in Chikpal- Marjum, which was attended by over 10,000 villagers. Both the villages had boycotted last assembly, parliamentary and assembly by-elections.


  "Chikpal and Marjum were cut off from mainland in 2008, when Maoists had dug up the Katekalyan -Chikpal road at 40-50 places. This area used to be the hotbed of Katekalyan area committee of Darbha division of the Maoists," said a police official.


  On July 19, 25 people were injured in a similar attack by the Maoists in Parcheli village of the Dantewada district.


  Chikpal-Marjum is a key strategic conduit for the Maoists, who freely move between Odisha and southern Bastar, and they are determined to maintain a stranglehold over these villages, the police said.


  Soni Sori, a tribal right activist from the Maoist-hit Bastar region, has also condemned Wednesday's incident.


  "The Maoists' assault of innocent tribals should be condemned. The police authorities must understand that when they (villagers) were planning to celebrate the 74th Independence Day in Marjum, the invitation should have been also extended to local leaders, sarpanchs and other activists, who have consistently resisted the Maoist aggression. Local leadership that acts as a pressure group cannot be ignored for any anti-Naxal campaign to become successful," she said.

Trump, in particular, has used his campaign to shift focus from the pandemic- hit U.S. economy to China, which he has blamed for the deadly coronavirus and ensuing economic malaise.


  "China will own the United States if this election is lost by Donald Trump," the president said last week. "If I don't win the election, China will own the United States. You're going to have to learn to speak Chinese."


  Biden, who as a young senator in 1979 was part of the first delegation to visit China after the U.S. normalized ties with the country, has also taken a harder line against Beijing. Early in his Senate career, he called a rising Beijing “a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large." Now, he regularly battles with Trump to be the toughest on Beijing among the two candidates.

Two newly formed tropical depressions at opposite ends of the Caribbean were expected to become tropical storms Friday, with forecasters projecting potential tracks for both that could take them toward the United States, possibly as hurricanes.Tropical Storm Genevieve in the Pacific, meanwhile, continued to weaken as it remained offshore from Mexico's southern Baja California peninsula while sweeping the coast with strong winds and rain that carried the threat of dangerous flooding.The two tropical depressions formed Thursday, and tropical storm watches were posted for several islands at the eastern end of the Caribbean while a tropical storm warning was posted at the Honduras-Nicaragua border region at the western side of the sea. A hurricane watch was posted for the southern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.The US National Hurricane Center said Tropical Depression 13 was likely to become a tropical storm Friday and then skirt the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The early, still uncertain track showed it potentially being near Florida by Monday as a hurricane.Friday morning, the system was centered about 305 miles (490 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and it was headed briskly to the west-northwest at 21 mph (33 kph).Tropical Depression 14 was forecast to graze the Atlantic coast of Honduras, then curve northward to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula possibly at hurricane strength and then potentially head for the Texas or Louisiana coast by Tuesday, again possibly strengthening into a hurricane. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Friday.Friday morning, it was centered about 30 miles (45 kilometers) north-northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph). It was headed west-northwest at 12 mph (19 kph).Genevieve, which had been a powerful Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) on Tuesday, had weakened to a tropical storm Thursday as it moved northwestward in the Pacific off Mexico's Los Cabos tourist resorts. The hurricane center said the storm was expected to continue weakening through the night, likely becoming a tropical depression by Friday evening.The hurricane center said Genevieve's maximum sustained winds had dropped to 50 mph (85 kph) Friday morning, and it was centered about 130 miles (210 kilometers) west-southwest of Cabo San Lazaro. It was moving to the west- northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).The storm knocked out power and phone service to a large part of the Los Cabos area, flooded streets in poor neighbourhoods and toppled palms in the tourist zone. High surf claimed two lives Tuesday as the storm approached the area.Baja California Sur state officials said 15,000 foreign tourists were in the state, most in the Los Cabos region, which earlier had almost been emptied of visitors by pandemic restrictions.

Keystone Solutions is a versatile firm that has delivered close to 50 projects in the field of hospitality and retail in the past five years.   In the capacity of the turnkey contractors for ZOBET, Keystone Solutions has offered solutions for civil projects, interiors, plumbing, electrical and furniture. ZOBET has been designed by ace interior stylist Sumessh Menon from Mumbai and inspired by the art deco soul of Kolkata; this gastro-pub catches the fancy by dint of the generous infusion of plush, modern materials and a vibrant colour palette.   The 7,500 plus square-feet area pegs it as one of the largest all-day gastro- pubs in Kolkata. The highlight of the Moroccan-themed interiors is a 35 feet- long trendy bar and three spacious PDR's, two 40 seaters each and a cosy 10 seater one. The USP of the place is the size which is spacious thus maintaining social distancing norms.   Select CITYWALK is a recurring client for Keystone Solutions, as last time the turnkey brand was appointed to revamp the entire flooring at Select CITYWALK and had led the project efficiently during the business hours - without interrupting the regular operations.   Being appreciated for the quality of work and the competent team that steers the projects, Keystone Solutions was once again appointed to recondition the new lobby at the basement by using the high-end Italian stone. Keystone Solutions and Select CITYWALK go a long way as the former has executed many successful projects for the restaurants at Select CITYWALK like PA PA YA, Sattvik to name a few.   "We have a robust network of experienced project supervisors, civil, electrical, plumbing and skilled labourers pan India who help us to deliver the project in time. We are thankful to our network of professionals because of whom we could deliver the projects in time during the pandemic too," said Sanjay Dabra, Co-founder at Keystone Solutions.   "It was an enriching experience to show our expertise in two entirely different projects. We have been leading diverse projects, for instance, ZOBET is a Moroccon themed gastro-pub on which we had worked from the scratch, whereas, Select CITYWALK has been standing tall for more than a decade. So the project guidelines are entirely different, thus showcasing our versatility," commented Gautam Kumar, Co-founder at Keystone Solutions.   "Working with Keystone Solutions was an educational and transformative experience for both of us as we were very much in sync as to how to go about design solutions at every step of detailing. We were able to synergise smoothly and therefore the design has transpired exactly as envisaged by us and the client," said Sumessh Menon, Design Director at Sumessh Menon Associates.   Launched in 2015, Keystone Solutions is a fully integrated turnkey contracting firm; constituting a team of motivationally-driven individuals determined to cater to their clients to the best of their abilities. Founded by Gautam Kumar and Sanjay Dabra, the brand debuted in the market with the intent to provide and implement ingenious solutions via turnkey execution.   The services further allow the brand to render its expertise in the field and offer smooth customer service with optimal client satisfaction, irrespective of the worksite, including a cafe, business space, a restaurant, mall, banks, complete set up of cloud kitchen or a hotel.   Keystone Solutions is a one-stop solution for all the client requirements and consists of a group of free thinkers who not only offer end-to-end execution and lend their skills to the professional ecosystem but also interpret and offer solutions on a particular element as well. For instance, if a customer seeks expertise or any specific solution for a specific task, Keystone Solutions has a team on-board that allows their clients to hire one for their task.   One of the key differentiators/USP's of the brand is the smooth operations that it carries out without any hassle to the client; an example being the project where Keystone Solutions focused on revamping the flooring of Select CITYWALK Mall, New Delhi, one of India's finest retail establishments. The turnkey contractors executed the entire project without causing any disruption to the patrons that walked in the operational mall.   This story is provided by NewsVoir.

To get through seven innings on 97 pitches, Wainwright had to first navigate around a problematic first inning. Corner infielders Paul Goldschmidt and Brad Miller committed throwing errors in the first inning that led directly to two unearned runs against Wainwright and an early 2-0 deficit.


  The errors also stacked additional pitches onto Wainwright’s arm.


  “If you let that bother you,” he said, “you’re toast.”


  It took the righthander 16 pitches to get through six batters in the first inning, and it could have been more expedient. It took Wainwright 30 pitches – almost half of the cap for his peers – to get through the Reds’ lineup the first time and by then he trailed 3-0 with a runner on base. With Yadier Molina back behind the plate for the first time since July, Wainwright was able to make the most out of what he described as inconsistent command and a misbehaving curveball. He allowed a homer in the second inning and consecutive hits to lead off the third that resulted in the Reds’ building their 4-2 lead.

Tech, often the pioneer in branding, isn’t responsible for all the great sonic branding, though. One of the oldest examples in advertising history is one of the least intuitive: Rice Krispies. The cereal’s iconic mascots, Snap, Crackle, and Pop, have been around since the 1930s so long that it’s easy to take their existence for granted. Looking back from a modern point of view, the decision to brand a food product according to the way it _sounded_ rather than the way it _tasted_ was a radical stroke of branding genius. In this regard, Rice Krispies can teach marketers today plenty about their mindset. To fully maximize the potential of sonic branding, one has to consider the many contexts in which consumers hear your brand and how you can leverage those opportunities effectively.

MOSCOW (AP) — Russian doctors treating opposition leader Alexei Navalny don't believe he was poisoned and refused to transfer him to a German hospital on Friday.Navalny, a 44-year-old politician who is one of President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics, was admitted to an intensive care unit in a coma at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk on Thursday, following what his supporters are calling a suspected poisoning that they believe was engineered by the Kremlin.But Russian doctors treating opposition politician Alexei Navalny say they haven't found any indication that the Kremlin critic was poisoned.Omsk hospital deputy chief doctor, Anatoly Kalinichenko, said that no traces of poison were found in Navalny’s body. Navalny spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, posted a video on Twitter of Kalinichenko speaking.“Poisoning as a diagnosis remains on the back burner, but we don’t believe that the patient suffered from poisoning,” Kalinichenko told reporters Friday.Kalinichenko added that the diagnosis have been determined and relayed to Navalny’s family members. He refused to reveal it to reporters, citing a law preventing medical workers from disclosing confidential patient information.Earlier Friday, Navalny ally Ivan Zhdanov said police found traces of a dangerous poisonous substance in the politician’s system, but didn’t say which one. Police officials didn’t confirm that.Russian medical officials also haven't approved Navalny's transfer to Germany.“The chief doctor said that Navalny is non-transportable. (His) condition is unstable. Family’s decision to transfer him is not enough,” Yarmysh tweeted. Omsk is about 4,200 kilometers (2,500 miles) east of Berlin, roughly a six-hour flight.Navalny fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk on Thursday and was taken to the hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. His team says a plane with all the necessary equipment is waiting at Omsk airport to take Navalny to a German clinic.Alexander Murakhovsky, chief doctor of the Omsk Ambulance Hospital No. 1 where the politician is being treated, told reporters on Friday that Navalny’s condition “somewhat improved,” but he wasn’t stable enough for a transfer. Murakhovsky said doctors were still working on determining a diagnosis.Yarmysh said that “the ban on transferring Navalny is needed to stall and wait until the poison in his body can no longer be traced. Yet every hour of stalling creates a threat to his life.”Like many other opposition politicians in Russia, Navalny has been frequently detained by law enforcement and harassed by pro-Kremlin groups. In 2017, he was attacked by several men who threw antiseptic in his face, damaging an eye.Last year, Navalny was rushed to a hospital from prison, where he was serving a sentence following an administrative arrest, with what his team said was suspected poisoning. Doctors said he had a severe allergic attack and discharged him back to prison the following day.Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption has been exposing graft among government officials, including some at the highest level. Last month, he had to shut the foundation after a financially devastating lawsuit from Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin.The most prominent member of Russia’s opposition, Navalny campaigned to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election, but was barred from running.He set up campaign offices across Russia and has been promoting opposition candidates in regional elections, challenging members of Russia’s ruling party, United Russia. One of his associates in Khabarovsk, a city in Russia’s Far East that has been engulfed in mass protests against the arrest of the region’s governor, was detained last week after calling for a strike at a rally.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Sometime next year, genetically modified mosquitoes will be released in the Florida Keys in an effort to combat persistent insect- borne diseases such as Dengue fever and the Zika virus.


  The plan approved this week by the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District calls for a pilot project in 2021 involving the striped-legged Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is not native to Florida. But it does transmit several diseases to humans, particularly in the Keys island chain where nearly 50 case of Dengue fever have been reported so far this year.


  The plan by the Oxitec biotechnology company is to release millions of male, genetically-altered mosquitoes to mate with the females that bite humans because they need the blood. The male mosquitoes, which don't bite, would contain a genetic change in a protein that would render any offspring unable to survive — thus reducing the population of the insects that transmit disease, in theory.


  Kevin Gorman, an Oxitec scientist, said Thursday in a phone interview from the United Kingdom that the company has done successful such projects in the Cayman Islands and Brazil.


  "It's gone extremely well," Gorman said. "We have released over a billion of our mosquitoes over the years. There is no potential for risk to the environment or humans."


  Oxitec points to numerous studies by government agencies, ranging from the Environmental Protection Agency to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that underline the safety of the project. Several Florida government agencies have approved it as well.


  Yet, there are people who worry about using genetically-modified organisms, or GMOs, that they believe could alter the planet's natural balance. At a meeting Tuesday of the Florida Keys mosquito control board, several people questioned the wisdom of the project.


  "You have no idea what that will do," Barry Wray, director of the Florida Keys Environmental Coalition, told the board.


  Whether or not the modified mosquitoes can efficiently crash the population of these mosquitoes in Florida remains an open question, some experts say.


  "The mosquitoes created in a lab have not gone through a natural selection process, in which only the fittest survive and mate. Once they are released in the natural environment, will they be as fit as the naturally occurring males and able to outcompete them for mates?" said Max Moreno, an expert in mosquito-borne diseases at Indiana University who is not involved in the company or the pilot project.


  Another question is whether the mosquitoes may have other unintended effects on the environment. If a spider, frog or bird eats the mosquito, will the modified protein have any effect on the predator?


  "An ecosystem is so complicated and involves so many species, it would be almost impossible to test them all in advance in a lab," said Moreno.


  Still, Keys mosquito board members voted 4-1 in favor of the project. One of the supporters, Jill Cranny-Gage, said at the meeting that insecticides and other chemical means have become less effective against the Aedes aegypti mosquito.


  "The science is there. This is something Monroe County needs," Cranny-Gage said. "We're trying everything in our power, and we're running out of options."

WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden was accepting the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday night, achieving the pinnacle — so far — of his nearly five-decade political career on the final night of the most unorthodox national convention in modern history.


  The former vice president was hoping the night helps the Democrats make progress toward not only unifying the diverse party but a deeply divided America struggling through a global pandemic as well.


  The night's keynote address was the speech of a lifetime for Biden, who at 77 would be the oldest president ever elected if he defeats Donald Trump in November. The convention leaned on a younger generation earlier in the night to help energize his sprawling coalition.


  Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois senator who lost both legs in Iraq and is raising two young children, said Biden has "common decency."


  Cory Booker, only the ninth African American senator in U.S. history, said Biden believes in the dignity of all working Americans.


  And Pete Buttigieg, a 38-year-old openly gay military veteran from Indiana, noted that Biden came out in favor of same-sex marriage as vice president even before President Barack Obama did.


  "Joe Biden is right, this is a contest for the soul of the nation. And to me that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans," Buttigieg said. "It's the struggle to call out what is good for every American."


  Above all, Biden was focusing on uniting the nation as Americans grapple with the long and fearful health crisis, the related economic devastation, a national awakening on racial justice — and Trump, who stirs heated emotions from all sides.


  Biden's positive focus Thursday night marked a break from the dire warnings offered by former President Obama and others the night before. The 44th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falter if Trump is reelected, while Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, the 55-year-old California senator and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, addressed race problems in a way Biden could not.


  Throughout their convention, the Democrats have summoned a collective urgency about the dangers of Trump as president. In 2016, they dismissed and sometimes trivialized him. In the days leading up to Biden's acceptance speech, they cast him as an existential threat to the country.


  Beyond Biden's highly anticipated speech, Thursday's program was designed to highlight the diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation he hopes to lead.


  "We know how important it is that we elect real leaders like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, people of honor and integrity, who hold justice close to their hearts and believe that the lives of my four black children matter," Lance Bottoms said. She spoke ahead of a tribute to the late John Lewis, the Georgia congressman and civil rights leader who devoted much of his life to ensuring African Americans are able to vote.


  Biden's Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy. They have drawn a sharp contrast with Trump's policies and personality, portraying him as cruel, self-centered and woefully unprepared to manage virtually any of the nation's mounting crises and policy challenges.


  Voting was a prime focus of the convention on Thursday as it has been all week. Democrats fear that the pandemic -- and the Trump administration -- may make it difficult for voters to cast ballots in person or by mail.


  Comedian Sarah Cooper, a favorite of many Democrats for her videos lip syncing Trump's speeches, put it bluntly: "Donald Trump doesn't want any of us to vote because he knows he can't win fair and square."


  Biden's call for unity comes as some strategists worry that Democrats cannot retake the White House simply by tearing Trump down; Biden needs to give his sprawling coalition something to vote for. That's easier said than done in a modern Democratic Party made up of disparate factions that span generation, race and ideology.


  For that reason, Thursday's program, like much of the convention, emphasized Biden's personal values like decency, honesty and empathy more than any single policy proposal or achievement.


  The pandemic has also forced Biden's team to abandon the typical pageantry and rely instead on a highly-produced, all-virtual affair that has failed to draw the same television ratings as past conventions.


  The silence was noticeable Wednesday night, for example, as Harris took the stage to make history in a cavernous hall inside the Chase Center in downtown Wilmington. She was flanked by American flags but no family, and her audience consisted of a few dozen reporters and photographers.


  It's Trump's turn next. The Republican president, who abandoned plans to host his convention in North Carolina and in Florida, is expected to break tradition and accept his nomination from the White House lawn next week.


  In the meantime, he's seeking to take attention from Biden. Trump was continuing this week's swing-state tour on Thursday with a stop near Biden's birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvani a. While he is trying to stay on offense, the president has faced a series distractions of his own this week, many of his own making.


  Trump on Wednesday praised a conspiracy-theory group that believes the president's political opponents support satanism and pedophilia. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors could access his long-hidden tax returns. Also Thursday, New York prosecutors announced the indictment of Steve Bannon, Trump's former campaign manager and White House chief counsel, who was charged with fraud.

"All four us have gone back years, but the idea for this group started off in Bournemouth," says Ben Ofeode. "We were doing a gig at Pride there, all individually. Shane was DJing, I was emceeing, Abz was doing his separate set and Dane was booked to DJ as well.


  "While we were all there together, we were catching up, getting merry, drinking a lot of lemonade - the strong type - and then all of a sudden during one of the performances, you had Shane getting up on the stage with Dane. Then next thing, I was rocking the mic with them and Shane was getting Abz to join us - so we were all there."


  Shane said: "After that performance, we were all buzzing from it. I think what was quite apparent was that the crowd was getting madder and madder as we kept bringing the next person up on stage. Something about having all of us boys - heritage boys - up there together, it felt special. And we weren't even playing our own songs, we were just playing a hip-hop set, but it was great.


  "I was chatting to Brandon Block [British DJ], and I said, 'Do you think the guys would be up for doing something like that somewhere down the road?' Then pretty much...ta-da! Here we are now."


  They were all one time rivals vying for chart positions during the '90s, but all four lads share a distinctive camaraderie with each other and admit that they've always appreciated each other's work.

Two newly formed tropical depressions at opposite ends of the Caribbean were expected to become tropical storms Friday, with forecasters projecting potential tracks for both that could take them toward the United States, possibly as hurricanes.


  Tropical Storm Genevieve in the Pacific, meanwhile, continued to weaken as it remained offshore from Mexico's southern Baja California peninsula while sweeping the coast with strong winds and rain that carried the threat of dangerous flooding.


  The two tropical depressions formed Thursday, and tropical storm watches were posted for several islands at the eastern end of the Caribbean while a tropical storm warning was posted at the Honduras-Nicaragua border region at the western side of the sea. A hurricane watch was posted for the southern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.


  The US National Hurricane Center said Tropical Depression 13 was likely to become a tropical storm Friday and then skirt the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The early, still uncertain track showed it potentially being near Florida by Monday as a hurricane.


   


   


  Friday morning, the system was centered about 305 miles (490 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and it was headed briskly to the west-northwest at 21 mph (33 kph).


  Tropical Depression 14 was forecast to graze the Atlantic coast of Honduras, then curve northward to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula possibly at hurricane strength and then potentially head for the Texas or Louisiana coast by Tuesday, again possibly strengthening into a hurricane. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Friday.


  Friday morning, it was centered about 30 miles (45 kilometers) north- northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph). It was headed west-northwest at 12 mph (19 kph).


  Genevieve, which had been a powerful Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) on Tuesday, had weakened to a tropical storm Thursday as it moved northwestward in the Pacific off Mexico's Los Cabos tourist resorts. The hurricane center said the storm was expected to continue weakening through the night, likely becoming a tropical depression by Friday evening.


  The hurricane center said Genevieve's maximum sustained winds had dropped to 50 mph (85 kph) Friday morning, and it was centered about 130 miles (210 kilometers) west-southwest of Cabo San Lazaro. It was moving to the west- northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).


  The storm knocked out power and phone service to a large part of the Los Cabos area, flooded streets in poor neighbourhoods and toppled palms in the tourist zone. High surf claimed two lives Tuesday as the storm approached the area.


  Baja California Sur state officials said 15,000 foreign tourists were in the state, most in the Los Cabos region, which earlier had almost been emptied of visitors by pandemic restrictions.

But the convention’s frontal focus on the former vice president’s “come one, come all” approach to politics was about more than how Biden would negotiate legislation and whip votes in Washington. It was meant to draw a direct contrast with Trump, who appears to view not only politicians, but most Americans in black and white terms: those who support him unequivocally and those who do not.

As in most "cat" thefts, Tracy's car was simply jacked up and a power tool used to saw the box that contains the "cat" from the exhaust pipe under her car.
 The damage almost left Tracy's car a write-off. She now faces a repair bill running into hundreds of pounds.
 "Something is not being done if they have free rein like this. What can change to stop them being sold on?" she said.
 Senior figures in the scrap industry believe the stolen "cats" are being passed from unlicensed scrap collectors to some unscrupulous licensed companies, from where the precious metals become untraceable.
 What needs to change, they say, is the enforcement of a law which was passed in 2013 as a response to the copper thefts which were blighting the rail and power networks.
 ## An easy market
 The Scrap Metal Dealers Act was supposed to deprive metal thieves of an easy market by banning cash sales and insisting on much better identity checks on sellers.
 Councils were empowered to do inspections of licensed dealers and to close down the unlicensed operators.
 But 5 Live Investigations has discovered this isn't happening.
 In October 2018, 243 English licensing councils were asked how many licensed scrap dealers on their books had been visited to ensure the new rules were being followed. The figures revealed only a fraction had been inspected and even fewer dealers - licensed and unlicensed - had been closed down.
 5 Live Investigations asked the same councils the same questions in February this year and found little improvement.
 Almost 120 councils had not visited any scrap dealers in the previous 28 months and many of the others had only inspected once or twice.
 A small number of councils, however, had inspected and had taken action against the rogue dealers, often in joint operations with the police.
 Part of the problem is that thousands of scrap dealers simply chose to drop out of the licensing scheme when the Scrap Metal Dealers Act came into force.
 Many of those, says the industry, are now those dealers that advertise on the internet and buy catalytic converters with no questions asked.
