Two days after signing onto a bid to impeach Gov. Mike DeWine for purportedly violating state law and the Ohio Constitution, Republican Rep. Nino Vitale was accused of illegally hiding how he raised and spent campaign funds.
   
 He turned in a blank campaign finance form the day after a completed one was due in early June, said Secretary of State Frank LaRose in referring the Urbana lawmaker to the Ohio Elections Commission. No record of Vitale attempting to update the legally required information was included.
   
 "I swore an oath to uphold the law, so when I see an apparent violation of our state's campaign finance statutes, I am duty bound to refer it to the Ohio Elections Commission." said LaRose in an unusual press release issued after the referral. "All public officials must be held accountable."
   
 In a Facebook post, Vitale cited past audits of his campaign finances and advice he said he got from the Ohio Ethics Commission.
   
 "I look forward to continuing to provide whatever information is necessary. I'm hopeful the many times I have proactively called into the Ohio Ethics Commission asking questions and clarifications and the many times I have been audited, will show that I have been above board and transparent about all activities, income and expenses my campaign has had," he said.
   
 Vitale has been as outspoken as any Ohio lawmaker against the DeWine administration's health orders issued to stem to spread of COVID-19. Vitale has refused to wear a mask even in legislative sessions, saying he didn't want to cover up a face made in the image of God.
   
 After he added his name to the push for the removal of his fellow Republican -- who he calls "Dictator DeWine" -- Vitale said on Facebook: "Articles of Impeachment do not go far enough for me. While it's a good step, Dictator DeWine needs to be charged and tried for crimes against humanity, in my opinion...
   
 "The hundreds and hundreds of phone calls I have gotten and continue to get at my office make me depressed and angry. This oppression has got to stop and I'm fighting it every way I know how."
   
 Vitale also was accused by LaRose of failing to report expenditures for three Facebook ads last year, which should have been made public on his campaign finance report for 2019 that was due at the end of January 2020.
   
 That wasn't all.
   
 Additionally, "Friends to Elect Nino Vitale directs contributors to make contributions through the campaign's online payment processor, publicly boasts about the success of the solicitations, but then failed to report having received any online contributions or the natural expenditures an online payment processor charges for having administered those contributions," LaRose said in his complaint to the commission.
   
 Vitale also was accused of co-mingling campaign money with his personal or business accounts. He directed payment for the conceal-carry class he teaches to his campaign account, the complaint says.
   
 Finally, Vitale converted campaign money to his personal use, LaRose said. The social media accounts he set up for his House campaign also were used for ads soliciting personal business, per the complaint.
   
 It was not immediately clear what penalties Vitale faces. The Elections Commission has relatively limited power.
   
 An attempt to reach him through a House spokeswoman was unsuccessful.

LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) — The remnants of Hurricane Laura are unleashing heavy rain hundreds of miles inland from a path of death and destruction left along the northwest Gulf Coast. Forecasters predict an eastern turn making the tropical depression a looming threat to the Mid-Atlantic states this weekend. Laura crashed ashore Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane near the Louisiana line with Texas. It was one of the strongest hurricanes ever to strike the U.S., packing 150-mph winds. Laura destroyed buildings, toppled trees and killed at least six people in the U.S. Forecasters say it could still pack a punch en route to the East Coast.

CANTON A northeast Canton man accused of a Saturday night shooting is facing additional charges.
   
 David D. Mayle, 20, of Young Avenue NE, was arrested Monday afternoon after he crashed his car in an attempt to flee from FBI Safe Streets Task Force agents, according to police and Stark County Jail records.
   
 He had been wanted on a felonious assault warrant stemming from the Saturday night shooting of a 31-year-old Mahoning Road NE man in the 1200 block of Lippert Road NE, according to Stark County court records.
   
 Canton Police reports show hospital security officers called police to report that a man with gunshot wounds had walked into the hospital.
   
 The warrant for Mayle's arrest on a felonious assault charge was issued on Monday.
   
 According to Lt. Dennis Garren, police spokesman, the agents spotted Mayle later Monday on a front porch in the 1300 block Barrett Court NW. He got into a vehicle, and according to investigators, he sped away as he hurled four loaded handguns from the car - two 9mms and two .40-caliber weapons.
   
 The agents arrested him when he crashed into another vehicle in the 1900 block of Sprint Avenue NE.
   
 At 11 a.m. Wednesday, additional warrants were filed, charging him with four counts each of having weapons under disability, evidence tampering and improper handling of firearms in a motor vehicle.
   
 Mayle remained behind bars on Monday, held in lieu of $150,000 bond pending a Canton Municipal Court hearing.

Undeterred by the Cincinnati Bengals giving up on their variance request submitted to Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to allow fans at games during the coronavirus pandemic, the Browns continue to fight.
   
 On Wednesday, the Browns emailed season-ticket holders with a "FirstEnergy Stadium Responsible Restart Plan" detailing how they would handle fans in the venue if allowed. The Browns said they have submitted the plan to the State of Ohio and the City of Cleveland, along with the respective health departments.
   
 Changes include mandated facial coverings, fans separated into four quadrants with dedicated gates based on their zone, recommended time windows for entry and pre-game health screenings.
   
 The email explained how tickets would be distributed to "pods of known fans" if the reduced stadium capacity is permitted. That means "trusted, self- selected groups" perhaps ranging from 1-10 people will be allowed to sit together, with their group social distancing from the next closest pods. Fans would be required to remain in their assigned seats unless going to the restroom or concession stands.
   
 According to the plan, those eligible would have access on a rolling basis in "waves" based on how long they have been season-ticket holders and their Private Seat License status. There will be a designated time window for purchase on a first-come, first-served basis.
   
 The stadium will transition to a cashless venue during the 2020 season, the email stated, although cash-to-card kiosks will be available. The Browns are exploring the possibility of fans ordering concessions through their mobile app. Parking passes will be distributed via mobile devices.
   
 The Browns' home opener is scheduled for Thursday night, Sept. 17, against the Bengals. On Aug. 16, owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam expressed their desire to fill 20 percent of FirstEnergy Stadium. With a capacity of 67,895, that would mean 13,579 could attend.
   
 Tailgating is prohibited in city-owned lots, Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson said in a recently updated COVID-19 state of emergency ordinance extended through Sept. 30.
   
 Browns Executive Vice President/Chief Operating Officer Dave Jenkins said along with local officials, the Browns had consulted the Center for Disease Control, University Hospitals' medical experts, "industry-leading venue consultants" and the NFL.
   
 "Moving forward is reliant on government approvals, and we understand and respect that process," Jenkins said in a statement. "As is the case every year, the health and safety of everyone in our building is paramount, and we are prepared to execute our plan with that priority in mind.
   
 "Given we are less than a month away from our first home game, we felt it was important for us to share these stadium operations elements with our fans now so they are informed and ready to adhere to all of the new policies and processes."
   
 Core principals of the plan are:
   
 • At least six feet of social distancing.
   
 • Requirements of masks or face coverings for all ages 10 and up.
   
 • A fan health promise that requires pre-event self-health screening.
   
 • Enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols throughout the venue.
   
 • Comprehensive hygiene protocols for fans and staff.
   
 • Extensive training, signage and communication.
   
 • Flexibility to adapt to evolving circumstances.
   
 A 12-page order from the Ohio Department of Health released on Aug. 19 said the maximum number of people gathered at any outdoor sports venue in Ohio would be limited to 1,500 fans or 15 percent of the fixed, seated capacity, whichever is lower. But teams were allowed to file a variance request, which the Browns and Bengals did.
   
 The Haslams have not wavered despite decisions by other NFL teams, including the Baltimore Ravens concerning their Sept. 13 opener against the Browns, that fans will not be permitted at least for the start of the season. With that call left up to individual states, the Miami Dolphins joined a short list of those allowing fans, announcing Monday that 13,000 will be permitted for their home opener.
   
 Costs to operate the stadium and the number of workers required would negate much of the financial gain.
   
 A report by Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk posted Tuesday estimated that each team's revenue after taxes would total $2.4 million for eight games. But Florio pointed out that along with the public relations aspect to allowing fans, the NFL Players Association is unlikely to pass on increased revenue, especially with the possibility that the salary cap for 2021 will drop because of the pandemic.
   
 "We've put a lot of time, effort and resources into ensuring that if we did have quote 20% fans, it could be a safe experience," Jimmy Haslam said during a Zoom video conference on Aug. 16. "Obviously, the final decision is up to the governor, but we're ready and excited to go, and I think the city of Cleveland feels the same way."
   
 Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said he understood how important attending games was to those who have remained devoted to the team that has not reached the playoffs since 2002.
   
 "I have heard from many of them already around the community, and they want very badly to be in person and to support us," Stefanski said on Aug. 20. "We obviously want them there, too, but we have to make sure whatever we do is safe."
   
 The Bengals announced Tuesday that they would not have fans at the Sept. 13 season opener against the Los Angeles Chargers at Paul Brown Stadium, but they would continue to monitor and explore the possibly for later games.
   
 "The variance we requested has not been granted by the state at this time," Bengals Executive Vice President Katie Blackburn said in a statement on the team's web site. "While we want fans to attend our games, we accept and understand the State of Ohio's position."
   
 Roster move
   
 The Browns claimed wide receiver Damion Willis off waivers from the Cincinnati Bengals on Wednesday.
   
 Willis entered the NFL last year, when he signed with the Bengals as an undrafted rookie free agent from Troy University. The Bengals cut him on Tuesday.
   
 Willis, 6-foot-3 and 204 pounds, appeared in 10 games and started two of them as a rookie. He had nine receptions for 82 yards.

Ultrasonic displacement sensors are basically used to detect objects and measure distance in industrial applications in which versatility and reliability are the key factors. For instance, Pepperl+Fuchs offers a wide variety of ultrasonic sensors which feature benefits such as large measuring ranges of up to 10 m, adjustable sound beams, and minimal dead bands, among others in wide range of housing designs. This automatically helps to offer reliable and efficient solutions. Furthermore, the ultrasonic displacement sensors offer impressive functionality, measurements by transmitting high- frequency sound pulses which are completely inaudible to humans. The sensors operate according to a time-of-flight measurement, by which they measure the time between transmitting the sound waves and receiving the object reflection. The devices help objects to be detected and their distance from the sensor to be measured. Pepperl+Fuchs ultrasonic sensors are equipped with integrated temperature compensation for reliable and accurate measurement. Hence, these ultrasonic displacement sensors are used drastically in industrial applications.

Hurricane Laura tore through Louisiana on Thursday, killing six people and flattening buildings across a wide swatch of the state before moving into Arkansas with heavy rains. Laura's powerful gusts uprooted trees - and four people were crushed to death in separate incidents of trees falling on homes. The state's department of health said late Thursday that there were two more fatalities attributed to the hurricane - a man who drowned while aboard a sinking boat and a man who had carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator in his home. In Westlake, a chemical plant caught fire when hit by Laura, and the flames continued to send a chlorine-infused plume of smoke skyward nearly 24 hours after landfall.Laura caused less mayhem than forecasts predicted - but officials said it remained a dangerous storm and that it would take days to assess the damage. At least 867,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas remained without power on Thursday afternoon."This was the most powerful storm to ever make landfall in Louisiana," Governor John Bel Edwards told a news conference. "It's continuing to cause damage and life-threatening conditions." Laura's maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph) upon landfall easily bested Hurricane Katrina, which sparked deadly levee breaches in New Orleans in 2005, and arrived with wind speeds of 125 mph. The NHC said Laura's eye had crossed into southern Arkansas late Thursday afternoon and was heading to the northeast at 15 mph (24 kph). The storm could dump 7 inches (178 mm) of rain on portions of Arkansas, likely causing flash floods. Laura was downgraded to a tropical depression by the NHC at 10 p.m., and the forecaster said it will move to the mid-Mississippi Valley later on Friday and then to the mid-Atlantic states on Saturday.Chemical plumeLaura's howling winds leveled buildings across a wide swath of the state and a wall of water that was 15 feet (4.6 m) high crashed into tiny Cameron, Louisiana, where the hurricane made landfall around 1 a.m. A calamitous 20-foot storm surge that had been forecast to move 40 miles (64 km) inland was avoided when Laura tacked east just before landfall, Edwards said. That meant a mighty gush of water was not fully pushed up the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which would have given the storm surge an easy path far inland. Tropical-force winds were felt in nearly every parish across Louisiana - and Edwards warned that the death toll could climb as search and rescue missions increase. Cleanup begins Residents of Lake Charles heard Laura's winds and the sound of breaking glass as the storm passed through the city of 78,000 with winds of 85 mph and gusts up to 128 mph in the hour after landfall.National Guard troops cleared debris from roads in Lake Charles on Thursday afternoon. There were downed power lines in streets around the city, and the winds tipped a few semi-trucks onto their sides. The windows of the city's 22-storey Capital One Tower were blown out, street signs were toppled and pieces of wooden fence and debris from collapsed buildings lay scattered in the flooded streets, video footage on Twitter and Snapchat showed. Lake Charles resident Borden Wilson, a 33-year-old pediatrician, was anxious about his return home after evacuating to Minden, Louisiana."I never even boarded up my windows. I didn't think to do that. This is the first hurricane I've experienced. I just hope my house is fine," he said in a telephone interview.

His sneakers, like Jordan's, were stylish and could be worn on and off the court. It's not always about the design of the sneakers— it's more about the person who inspired them.

1. India’s coronavirus tally on Friday rose to 33,87,500 after 77,266 new infections. The country’s toll went up by 1,057 to 61,529.     2. Six states ruled by Opposition parties – West Bengal, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Punjab and Maharashtra – moved the Supreme Court seeking postponement of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test and Joint Entrance Examination due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The states filed a review petition against the Supreme Court judgement earlier this month, which rejected a plea for such postponement.     3.

This service remained suspended even after domestic flights resumed operations on May 25.     4. The Union health ministry said India’s Covid-19 recovery rate has touched 76.28%, as 60,177 people recovered from the disease in 24 hours. “The number of recoveries is nearly 3.5 times the active cases, which comprise 21.90% of the total cases,” says a statement by the ministry. “Higher number of recoveries has led to a constantly growing difference between recoveries and active cases.

NICE (AP) — The dominant force at the Tour de France for most of the last decade, the Ineos team of defending champion Egan Bernal is seeing its dominance challenged, and this year's race could well be the one marking a major shift of power in cycling. Not since Bradley Wiggins' triumph at the marquee event back in 2012 has the British outfit been under such threat as it is on the starting line in the Riviera city of Nice, where the three-week race is set to start Saturday under the cloud of COVID-19. The pandemic has forced the Tour to move to the end of the summer holidays and the few races held prior to the event strongly suggest that Dutch team Jumbo-Visma is ready to replace Ineos as the top Grand Tour squad. But a changing of the guard this summer is far from guaranteed. The uncertainty brought on by the virus and the steady rise of cases in France in recent weeks mean there is a real risk the race could be stopped short if the situation deteriorates further or if the peloton is badly hit by positive results. “We don’t know, nobody knows, if we’re going to reach Paris,” Ineos manager Dave Brailsford said on Friday. “To be fair, if it comes to a point where it’s detrimental to the riders and teams, people need to take that on board as well. We need to be responsible and reasonable in our approach.” Led by the 2019 Spanish Vuelta winner Primoz Roglic and 2018 Tour de France runner-up Tom Dumoulin, Jumbo-Visma arrived at the Tour with a roster capable of controlling the race in the mountains, an essential element that was a hallmark of the Ineos teams in previous years. Roglic, a former ski jumper from Slovenia, has all the qualities required to win this mountainous edition of the Tour that will take the peloton over France's five mountain ranges. A climber with great downhill abilities, he would...

Key quotes "The next moves in US yields in the wake of the latest Fed's decision promise to be crucial in determining the price action in the pair in the very near-term. In addition, political uncertainty (if any) following PM Abe's resignation could also undermine the scenario around the Japanese safe haven." "USD/JPY faces immediate contention in the boundaries of the 105.00 yardstick, or monthly lows. If sellers remain in control, then focus of attention should shift to the July low in the 104.20 zone. While further downside remains on the cards - particularly following the current bearish 'outside day' candle - a visit to the area of yearly lows in the 101.20/15 band is not favoured for the time being." "On the upside, the 107.00 region emerges as the next hurdle of significance ahead of the critical 200-day SMA just below 108.00 the figure."

Luchamos por la democracia con la misma visión en el Grupo de Lima y cuidamos nuestra Amazonía con el Pacto de Leticia. Hoy enfrentamos unidos el reto sanitario, económico y social más complejo de los últimos 100 años. La pandemia golpea con crueldad a nuestros pueblos y con particular virulencia a las comunidades indígenas y poblaciones originarias que habitan la zona fronteriza del Putumayo, donde hemos registrado tasas de contagios y fallecimientos por encima de los promedios nacionales. Para atender esta dolorosa realidad, el 14 de mayo reunimos el mecanismo de diálogo y coordinación política (2+3) que conforman los ministros de Relaciones Exteriores, Defensa e Interior, a los que sumamos en esta oportunidad a los ministros de Salud. En ese marco, abordamos la emergencia con una óptica integral, que sumó a las consideraciones sanitarias aquellos aspectos de desarrollo social y seguridad imprescindibles para enfrentarla con éxito. La principal decisión del mecanismo 2 + 3 fue la creación de un Comité Binacional COVID-19 encargado de coordinar acciones para enfrentar la pandemia en la zona fronteriza, presidido por los ministerios de Salud e integrado por los sectores competentes en materias de Desarrollo Social y Seguridad. El resultado concreto del trabajo de dicho comité, que queremos resaltar conjuntamente en la fecha, es un plan integral de acción binacional para enfrentar el COVID-19 que nos permitirá hacer un seguimiento coordinado de la evolución de la pandemia, promover la salud, prevenir riesgos sanitarios, fortalecer la capacidad de atender emergencias, potenciar los establecimientos de salud y proponer protocolos sanitarios armonizados que contribuyan a impulsar la reactivación económica y el intercambio fronterizo a todo nivel. De esta manera, asumimos juntos la responsabilidad de asegurar el bienestar de nuestras comunidades fronterizas a través de una cooperación efectiva. Este plan binacional constituye una valiosa experiencia piloto para emprendimientos futuros, que viene a sumarse a iniciativas ya en marcha desde hace muchos años, como la telemedicina o las jornadas binacionales de apoyo al desarrollo. La construcción y la ejecución de este plan binacional demuestra que la diplomacia y nuestras tradicionales relaciones de amistad, cooperación e integración se alinean rápidamente en momentos críticos al servicio de nuestras poblaciones más vulnerables. Demuestra, sobre todo, que podemos enfrentar, juntos, enormes retos, como el que vivimos hoy.

MASSILLON Uncertainty in April amid COVID-19 kept a high number of golfers off the course for weeks at The Legends of Massillon.
   
 But a significant increase in play since May has customers back in the swing.
   
 "Golf has really been booming (this summer)," said Carrie Lowry, general manager and PGA golf pro at The Legends. "(Outdoor courses) are one of the safest places to be, and golf is something about anyone can do at any age."
   
 Proceeds remain below par at The Legends for the year so far, mainly a result of the pandemic.
   
 Income through July is about $670,000, according to Lowry, who said that amount is down approximately $95,000 compared to 2019.
   
 A main reason for the shortfall was not being able to offer golf carts in April as a precaution to help limit the spread of COVID-19. Only those who walked were permitted to play during that month.
   
 April rounds of golf were a trickle compared to a normal year, Lowry said. Only 519 rounds were recorded at The Legends, compared to 9,341 last year.
   
 "It felt like we were closed (in April) because of the pandemic," said Lowry.
   
 In May, clear panels installed on carts to help ensure safety have allowed more than one golfer to ride at a time. That action contributed toward upping the number of players and rounds through the summer, Lowry said.
   
 The slightly less revenue so far in 2020 has not impacted overall operations, said Lowry, who pointed to a lower amount of expenses during the pandemic, helping to maintain some balance.
   
 Rounds aplenty
   
 According to Lowry, May averaged 286 golfers per day at The Legends, while total rounds for the month were 8,894. That's 3,363 more than in 2019.
   
 Longtime Legends' golfer David Ford, of Jackson Township, has not shied away from his favorite outdoor activity.
   
 Ford, who golfs four-to-five days a week in Massillon, said he routinely takes precautions, such as keeping a safe distance from other golfers.
   
 "I don't mingle much in groups and all that," said Ford, 76. "I don't worry much (about COVID-19). I go in (the clubhouse) with my mask, and then go out an enjoy the game."
   
 Rounds were also up comfortably in June and July.
   
 The average number of per day golfers in June was 293, Lowry said, which equated to 8,789 rounds played. That figure is up 3,411 from 2019.
   
 In July, 296 daily golfers was the norm, according to Lowry, who said 8,337 rounds were played, which was up 2,546 from the previous year.
   
 The number of golfers and finances at the course should rebound more when August concludes.
   
 "(August) has been pretty good for us," she said.

It has long been accepted, at least in some circles, that there is a condition known as Trump Derangement Syndrome. But if there are still any skeptics out there, consider the reaction to first lady Melania Trump's renovation of the White House Rose Garden.


   


  The modern version of the garden was created during the Kennedy administration and updated during the first year of the Reagan administration. It was a living thing, something intended to grow and change.


   


  In 1981, first lady Nancy Reagan asked the godmother of the garden, philanthropist Bunny Mellon, who created the original design for Jacqueline Kennedy, "to return to the White House and re-energize the planting that had become lackluster over the preceding 20 years," according to a report by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. "Mrs. Mellon suggested removing two of the crabapple [trees] in each bed and pruning them back into shape ... along with new plantings of lilies and roses." In other words, Mellon did not view the garden as an unchangeable monument.


   


  That was 40 years ago. In that time, parts of the garden have grown out of their original proportions, while use of the garden for events, from news conferences to parties, has increased. Working with Mrs. Trump, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House conducted a study and produced a 200-page report on the state of the garden. Among other things, they found some of the infrastructure of the garden was a mess. "Loose and exposed wires were found everywhere and connected using electrical tape," the report said.


   


  Infrastructure improvements, and much more, were part of the first lady's update of the garden. "The changes you see are the result of a thoughtful and collaborative process carefully crafted with the help of scholars and experts in architecture, horticulture, design and historic preservation," Mrs. Trump said at an event christening the garden on a recent Saturday. "This renewal included improvements to the infrastructure and utilities, allowing this beautiful garden to more readily meet the needs of a busy White House. These improvements also make the garden fully accessible to all Americans, including those with disabilities." (As for power cables and wiring, they are hidden beneath a newly installed path of limestone pavers.)


   


  So what's the problem? When the garden improvements were announced, you might have thought the first lady had created the set for a new Nuremberg rally. "The Trump family did its best to turn the lovely Rose Garden into a neo- fascist parade ground," tweeted longtime Washington journalist Howard Fineman.


   


  A former New York Times reporter, Kurt Eichenwald, who has been the source of much erratic commentary in the Trump era, targeted Melania Trump's background. (Born in Slovenia, the first lady came to the United States 24 years ago and became a naturalized U.S. citizen 14 years ago, in 2006.) "It is a destruction of our history, something no other first lady had the gall to do," Eichenwald tweeted. "This is the first time I have been furious that @FLOTUS is a foreigner. She has no right to wreck our history." Eichenwald took some hits on Twitter for his xenophobia and later deleted his tweet.


   


  Critics posted photos of the old Rose Garden in full bloom in spring alongside the newly redesigned garden with the normal fewer blooms in August. And then political Twitter pounced. "Devoid of color, they somehow brought a white supremacy vibe to the #RoseGarden," said one tweet. "The Trumps are all Satan," said another. "You took away all of the colors and turned Jackie Kennedy's beautiful Rose Garden into a funeral home for white supremacists," said another. "She was going for that 'Nuremberg rally grounds' look," said yet another. "I seriously hate the Demon and his wife," said one more. "Look at what they ruined. I can't wait until Jill Biden is first lady and brings back the #RoseGarden full of flowers, trees and nothing but sheer vibrance."


   


  The short version: In a matter of hours, the Rose Garden had become just another battleground in the Trump wars, like the post office but even sillier. The first lady's effort was serious, carefully done and needed. (And, like the original garden, paid for by private funds.) But everything is fair game in today's supercharged political atmosphere. Even flowers.

According to the Wildlife Trust, the creature is seen all around the UK but most commonly near the South and West coasts and offshore.
 The Trust urges people to 'maintain a distance of at least 100m' from the animals if they meet them at sea, 'especially if calves are present.'
 'If the dolphins approach you, maintain a constant speed and allow them to interact on their own terms and leave at will,' it added.
 Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is illegal to 'intentionally or recklessly disturb any dolphin or whale' in British waters.
 It is also against the law to 'sell, offer or expose for sale any cetacean.'
 Common Dolphins - or short-beaked dolphins - live in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, alongside the Mediterranean, Red and Black seas.
 They prefer temperate waters and can be spotted close to coastlines and far out in open ocean.
 In 2018, the Natural History Museum reported there had been a significant jump in the number of the aquatic mammals seen around the Scottish Hebrides.
 Experts at the time believed the creatures were responding to warmer waters in the area.
 Becky Dudley, Marine Biodiversity Officer at Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, said: 'We have a consistent dataset gathered over 15 years that allows us to look at trends.
 'Common dolphins were rare in 2003, but since then we have had a twenty-fold increase in sightings. Now, common dolphins are the most common species of dolphin that we see.'

Lehfeldt usually markets about 2,000 lambs through MSR between the months of March and June. When he first started selling lambs in 2020, they were going for $1.60 a pound, but by the time he was selling his last loads the price had plummeted to $0.85 a pound, which is way below the break-even point.


  The pandemic certainly complicated matters with the MSR sale. When MSR initially entered bankruptcy, another company bid on it with the intention of keeping the facility for lamb processing, but ultimately their bid was $200,000 less than JBS. Grassroots organizations did all they could to make up the difference between the bids, but money was simply tight.


  “As an industry, we really couldn’t lend a hand to a bankruptcy situation,” Lehfeldt said.


  There are still several questions surrounding the sale of MSR to JBS, but by far the biggest one weighing on the minds of sheep producers is how things are going to look going forward. Essentially one-fifth of the U.S.’s lamb processing capacity was lost overnight and there are 149 producers out there that no longer have a vertically integrated market path for their lambs.


  Lehfeldt was lucky enough to be able to market his lamb crop through MSR this year before the sale was finalized, but from here on out, he is just taking it day-by-day. In a normal year, Lehfeldt retains ownership on all of his ewe lambs and also buys a semi-load of feeder lambs. He plans to do both again this year.


  “We will be taking our lambs through the same process as normal, but we aren’t sure right now where we are going to market them through,” Lehfeldt said.


  As a fifth-generation sheep rancher, Lehfeldt is no stranger to industry hardships, but even he says the closing of MSR is a pretty devastating hit for feeder lambs in the west.


  “Sheep producers are used to dealing with struggles. Between labor, fencing and predator issues it is becoming harder to raise sheep in the west but this issue is a little out of our control,” Lehfeldt added.


  The U.S. sheep industry may be a bit rattled by this recent knock to the knees, but ultimately the strength and resiliency of American sheep producers will withstand the test. From a policy standpoint, Jim Brown concluded by saying this issue is of number one concern for the MWGA. They plan to continue working with ASI in the quest for answers.

In Florida, career criminal Joseph Williams, serving time on a heroin charge, won an early COVID-19 release in March. He was then rearrested for a murder that occurred the day after he got out. Williams, 26, now stands accused of homicide, possession of heroin and possession of a firearm.


  It’s interesting to note that Ayala, like Williams, was a 26-year-old self- admitted drug addict and habitual criminal at the time of his most heinous crimes.


  True, Ayala has now served more than 40 years, and he is 68 years old. So, are we to assume he is too old to commit future crimes? Are we sure he is completely rehabilitated and won’t seek to harm the two people who consistently fought to keep him behind bars — surviving siblings Jason and Maggie?


  “He knows I am the one who spearheaded this drive all these years,” Jason told me. “Of course, we’re concerned. He’s a smart guy, and he’s a sociopath who has never shown remorse.”


  Gov. Andrew Cuomo is not interested enough to intervene. The parole board will not say why it decided to release Ayala or whether it has anything to do with COVID-19. Perhaps Ayala is in poor health. But that begs the question: Do we ever owe mercy to someone who so heartlessly robbed four children of their mothers and then laughed about it?


  Jason, who, as a 6-year-old, tried to save his mother and had a gun slammed into his tiny face, admits he is worried.


  “I have an 11-year-old daughter,” he said. “We already have a big dog and an alarm system, but now I’m getting a better one. I’m planning to get a permit for a rifle.”


  Keep Jason’s story in mind next time you hear about compassionate COVID-19 prison releases, won’t you? For survivors and victims, they can mean a life sentence of fear.

It is a well appreciated fact that sheep are what opened up the American West. Many ranches across the region can trace their history to a time when it was bands of sheep, not herds of cattle, that paid the bills. The U.S. sheep industry has had its struggles over the years, no doubt, but the recent purchase of the Mountain States Rosen (MSR) processing facility by meat packing Goliath, JBS, is a blow that resonates deep.


  MSR was a cooperatively owned lamb processing facility in Colorado with 149 producer members from several different western states. MSR was the second biggest lamb facility in the country, processing around 350,000 lambs or about 20 percent of the market annually. JBS purchased MSR during bankruptcy proceedings and they intend to use the facility solely to process beef going forward.


  “It is fair to call this a nightmare scenario. Especially during a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has already made it difficult for producers to access markets for their lambs,” stated Jim Brown, Director of Public Affairs for the Montana Wool Growers Association (MWGA).

However, the more overstimulated and crammed my days were, the more lonely and restless I found myself in the inevitable and unavoidable moments when I was alone: the hours when my roommate was in class, nights being the last one in the library, and walks back from class at the end of the day.

With no scrimmage tape to scout, one might wonder if the Lake Blue Streaks are completely in the dark about the 2020 Perry Panthers.
   
 Perry head coach Keith Wakefield sheds some light.
   
 "It's not hard to get ready for us," Wakefield said. "We do the same stuff."
   
 Knowing what the Panthers do is one thing.
   
 Stopping what the Panthers do is a different challenge entirely.
   
 Perry hosts Lake on Friday in a game that serves as the regular season opener and Federal League opener for both teams in this COVID-19 shortened campaign.
   
 The Panthers have been remarkably consistent under Wakefield, averaging 10 wins the past five seasons and making the playoffs five of the last six. They won at least a share of three straight league titles from 2015-17.
   
 They do it, year after year, with an unrelenting wing-T and Wakefield's no- nonsense methods.
   
 Of course, consistency is not exclusive to Perry.
   
 "Lake is a little that way. Central Catholic is that way," Wakefield said. "The good programs stay the course. They don't change like bed sheets. They have a plan and stick with it."
   
 To be fair, Perry, which had three intrasquad scrimmages instead of facing an outside opponent, is in the same position as Lake in terms of scouting. The Blue Streaks scrimmaged Marlington last week, but there was no video exchange since Perry could not reciprocate. The two teams shared rosters and starting lineups.
   
 Lake head coach Dan DeGeorge is more concerned with matching Perry's toughness and discipline than Xs and Os.
   
 "They do what they do. It's just that they're so damn good at it on both sides of the ball," said DeGeorge, whose team absorbed a 51-13 drubbing from Perry last year. "I've always had a lot of respect for Coach Wakefield. You know his team is going to be very sound and very coachable. Sure, we'd like to know a little more about individual personnel, but they're going to do what they do, and that's what they've always done."
   
 Perry brings back some impressive skill players, led by running back Joshua Lemon, who is questionable for Friday because of a hamstring issue. Quarterback Hayden Vinas is another returner, along with WR-DB Devonte Armstrong. Wakefield believes this team throws and catches the football better than most of his teams in recent years.
   
 But the Panthers don't have the size and experience along the lines they've become accustomed to.
   
 "It's the same as it's always been," Wakefield said. "Whether you throw it 40 times or run it 60 times, you've still got to win upfront more times than not to be successful."
   
 Said DeGeorge of the Perry front, "If you're playing on the offensive line for Coach Wakefield, you've got to be pretty good."
   
 Lake, coming off a 6-4 season, is thinking big with 17 starters and 21 lettermen back.
   
 But DeGeorge is in a similar place with his team as Wakefield. Lake returns QB Jake Eckels, 1,000-yard back Dreden Owens (who missed last year's Perry game with an injury) and about six interchangeable players both at receiver and in the defensive secondary. Linebackers Nick Maricocchi and Gavin Shinn are impact players in the middle of Lake's defense.
   
 "My concern is upfront," DeGeorge said.
   
 The Blue Streaks certainly are big enough, with multiple 300-pounders in the mix.
   
 "When we're warming up, we're a better looking team than most in terms of size and strength," DeGeorge said. "But that doesn't mean much on Friday nights. We have size and speed, but I still question our toughness. It's a process and we have a ways to go."

An interesting regulatory decision was announced Wednesday night that could play a role in what is shaping up to be a busy fall and winter for startups going public.


  The New York Stock Exchange received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for a new way to go public that would allow companies to raise money via direct listings, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.


  For background, during a traditional IPO, a company has the ability to issue new shares to raise money, but existing shareholders can't cash out. A direct listing allows existing shareholders to cash out, with the caveat that the company can't raise money. (There is plenty of additional nuance between the two processes, but let's try and keep it simple.)


  So what does NYSE's approval mean? It's tough to tell. Getting the best of both worlds is nice, but it seems unlikely traditional IPOs would be abandoned completely.

Todd Zinicola is pretty sure it’s the only time someone has smoked a Black &amp; Mild cigar in a Virginia courtroom at the request of a judge.He was defending a client in Fairfax who police searched after saying they smelled marijuana during a routine traffic stop. But Zinicola argued in court that it was impossible for the state trooper to smell the drug, wrapped in two layers of plastic wrap in the back seat, over the overpowering scent of the Black &amp; Mild the man was smoking at the time.The judge, Jane Marum Roush, who would go on to serve a brief term on the Supreme Court of Virginia, was unfamiliar with the product’s smell and invited him to light it, according to a transcript of the hearing.“This is highly unorthodox but — here, just go ahead,” she said.Zinicola wafted the smoke toward Roush, who ultimately agreed — the trooper couldn’t have actually smelled marijuana over the cigar’s overpowering aroma.Advocates pushing to rein in such warrantless searches say the 2007 case illustrates just how difficult it can be for defendants to challenge police officers’ assertion that they smelled marijuana, a claim that’s impossible to document and frequently used as probable cause to rifle through a suspect’s vehicle or pockets.“The problem is judges only see the cases where someone got charged with possession of marijuana or some other offense,” Zinicola said. “But a countless number of times, people get searched, are kept on the side of the road for hours, and police find nothing and they leave. It’s traumatizing.”Many Virginia lawmakers and advocates in the criminal justice system appear to agree and legislation is advancing in both chambers of the General Assembly to prohibit smell-based searches for the drug.The proposal was first raised earlier this year when the General Assembly passed&nbsp;decriminalization legislation&nbsp;that reduced the penalty for possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a Class 1 misdemeanor to a $25 civil infraction.Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond,&nbsp;championed the measure&nbsp;during the regular legislative session that began in January and it won approval in the Senate but was rejected in the House, where Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, said she was unwilling to tie the hands of police officers until the drug was fully legalized.READ MORE ON VIRGINIAMERCURY.COM&gt;The Virginia Mercury is a new, nonpartisan, nonprofit news organization covering Virginia government and policy.Submit a news tip.

That, to say the least, is unadvisable in a world where neoliberalism is crumbling before our eyes. Letting the Lib Dems soak up these voters, actually leaves Labour the space to be more radical.

Lovers of fair food — and aren't we all — are still processing the news that this year will be different. While there is talk of some fair food events, the one you can put on your calendar now starts this weekend.
 Kern County Teen Challenge, known for its irresistible apple and peach dumplings, is holding a Fair Food Frenzy on weekends now through Sept. 10. Diners can order dumplings individually ($6) or in packs of three ($15) or six ($30). The nonprofit is also cooking up fresh kettle corn in small ($8) and large ($10) bags and selling bottled water and soft drinks ($3).
 Kailey Salinas, special events coordinator for Teen Challenge, said this was their way of thinking outside of the box to raise funds since the pandemic has forced them to cancel, postpone or modify most of their 2020 events.
 "We have taken a 50 percent cut because of COVID-19," she said of fundraising. "This is one of our biggest fundraisers. We also do CALM HolidayLights, a golf tournament and 5K for Recovery, which we're doing virtually this year."
 Those who want to order fair treats have a few options. They can order through the Eventbrite event linked on the nonprofit's Facebook page (facebook.com/KernCountyTeenChallenge), by emailing kern@teenchallenge.org or calling 399-CARE (2273). There will be ordering on-site but preorders are preferred.
 Curbside pickup will be available from 2 to 6 p.m. Friday through Sunday through Sept. 10 at 301 E. Roberts Lane. There will be two lines, one for preorders and another for new orders, Salinas said.
 "We've been getting great feedback on Facebook," Salinas said of posting the event. "Several people have placed their orders. There's a lot of excitement. Everybody loves the kettle corn and our dumplings. And they want to support a cause they believe in.
 All funds raised go to benefit the faith-based drug and alcohol recovery program, which continues to be offered free of charge to participants.
 If you want to work off those calories from the dumplings, you can also sign up for the Kern County Teen Challenge Walk for Recovery, which is being held virtually through the month of September. Sign up at justgiving.com/campaign/KTCwalk to take part.
 For those looking for more fair food options, stay tuned. Kern County Fair officials hinted at a drive-through event planned for next month. There is also another event in the works, so keep your eyes on The Dish for more details.

Walls was reportedly waiting in the getaway vehicle while Ayala and Profit tortured and raped the women inside the house. Before Ayala and his gang left, they fatally shot Bonnie Minter and Sheila Watson multiple times.


  “Ayala personally raped my mother. He personally shot my mother,” Jason, now 49, told me during a conversation last week. “I heard him as he got into the (getaway) van joking about his sexual prowess.”


  Young Jason testified at the traumatic trial, which ended with the jury finding all three defendants guilty. But for the Minter children, only turmoil followed. Jason’s father remarried, but that union turned out to be a disaster, exposing the kids to unspeakable abuse. Without their protective mother, Jason and Maggie were left adrift.


  “I have no real memories of my mother other than related to the crime,” Jason said. “Other than that day, it’s just a blank.”


  Profit died in prison in 2016. Walls, who did not participate in the rapes and murders, was paroled earlier this year. In 2002, Ayala first came up for parole. Every two years, Jason and Maggie have come forward to personally reexperience their horror and to beg the New York State Parole Board not to release the man who violated their mother and put bullets in her head. The sibling’s latest face-to-face appearance, which would have been in July but was interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions, was relegated to a teleconferencing call. Jason believes that worked in the killer’s favor. Parole was granted.


  We hear that prisons are only releasing those at the end of their sentence or inmates who pose no danger to the public. That’s not true.


  Space restrictions allow me to detail just one of the many cases in which a so-called low-risk prisoner was released and then went on to commit serious crimes.

Maxwell takes exception with Hartley-Nagle's statements that the harassment claims--filed by the personnel committee members Councilwoman Janet Kilpatrick and Councilman Tim Sheldon on Maxwell's behalf and not by Maxwell herself-- were a "political witch-hunt."
 "The fact that she continues to say that there is 'no smoking gun' and that this is all just a 'political witch-hunt' is laughable to me, considering she's not allowed to have anyone in her direct employ," noted Maxwell.
 She also spoke publicly for the first time--aside from statements she made in the confidential report obtained by WDEL in 2017--about the alleged harassment she endured.
 "There was not a day that went by that I was not harassed in some form or another - from telling me that I needed to just get over the death of my fiancee, from refusing to allow me to attend funerals because she actually said to me: 'I've had enough people in my life die,' to making me call and let her know when I was using the bathroom and then making me call when I returned from the bathroom...just constant control and harassment."
 Maxwell said New Castle County Council's failure to investigate has forced her to look into hiring an attorney and speak out publicly--only to WDEL--saying she's mortified that Hartley-Nagle would take a risk by violating the NDA.
 Maxwell believes Hartley-Nagle is only speaking up about the issues now because she's up for re-election in a few weeks - facing primary opponents Ciro Poppiti and Monique Johns.
 "All I wanted her to do was to shut up. I wanted her to stop talking about me. She had kept her mouth shut for the last three years, and because it's an election. She's trying to win an election, and I am a thorn in her side and the scenario is a thorn in her side, (and) she decided to open her mouth up now."
 Maxwell told WDEL her attempts to hire an attorney have been thwarted both by conflicts of interest, expressed by attorneys, and hefty upfront legal costs.
 "I'm stuck. At any given point, she can just open up her mouth, and I really have no recourse because nobody wants to help me, and what she is saying is false."
 It is true Maxwell is a convicted felon. She pleaded guilty to a theft charge in Arizona 15 years ago and served 45 days in jail. But she said Hartley-Nagle knew that when she hired her and insists she legally disclosed her felony, in the presence of others at a breakfast meeting with Hartley-Nagle at Lucky's Diner in Talleyville. Maxwell further asserts Hartley-Nagle had done an online criminal background search on her before she was hired and had known about the felony before she even saw Maxwell's resume.
 "I was not on probation at the time. [Hartley-Nagle's] position at the time was that she believed that people could turn their lives around, that she believed people could redeem themselves, and that she believed in me. And basically what she did was she knew that I had just lost my fiancee in a very public way, and she used me for political gain. She used me for political clout. She knew that it would look good on her that she was hiring the fiancee of a fallen firefighter; and from the moment I walked into that office, I was abused and harassed, and it just keeps continuing. She does not stop," Maxwell said.
 Since leaving county council staff, Maxwell has started her own business that helps others. She also volunteers in the community and is raising her two sons.
 "She took everything from me. I started my own business to get away from this, and I've been very successful, but that's not for Karen Hartley-Nagle not trying to destroy me," said Maxwell. "I've really put this behind me. I have not opened my mouth up once about Karen Hartley-Nagle. The only reason I'm speaking out now is because I feel like I have no other choice, and the allegations or the lies that she made against me in that Facebook video need to be addressed.
 Maxwell said she's changed her life around after making a mistake 15 years ago.
 "I am a firm believer that people are able to turn their lives around...she basically implied that because I have had a checkered past and because I am a convicted felon that I am not worthy of a job, that I am not worthy of a position, that I could never be an upstanding member of society or the community, and I beg to differ, and my record shows differently," said Maxwell.

The road to New Mutants’ eventual release was a long and winding one, punctuated by delays, new ownership from Fox to Disney, and behind-the-scenes issues. A new report has shed some light on the latter, with Fox apparently _really_ disliking the first cut of the movie.
 After principal filming was complete, Fox reportedly had a seriously negative reaction as the “studio discussed throwing the entire movie out to ‘start over’ with a total reshoot,” according to Vulture.
 Before even that less-than-lukewarm response, several aspects of New Mutants ended up being left on the cutting room floor. It’s a miracle this movie even got made, judging by the scope of the shifts the X-Men spin-off ended up taking.
 Originally set in the 1980s and envisioned as a “hybrid-horror Breakfast Club movie,” New Mutants would have featured crossovers with the X-Men - including Storm as a “sadistic jailer” - and there were even wider plans for a trilogy.
 But, the creative process was shaky, to put it mildly. The report details writers being continually brought in to punch up the material, a new direction away from the Breakfast Club motif after shot-callers got cold feet, and a roundtable “intervention” with director Josh Boone.
 After some serious behind-the-scenes struggles, New Mutants was eventually filmed and, remarkably, no reshoots were done. What you’ll see in theatres is what was filmed the first time around. No pick-ups, no Rogue One-style retread, nothing. So much for starting over. According to the first reviews, the results are mixed.

MAGNOLIA Fred Thomas was all set for one more year coaching football before retiring.


   


  He was looking forward to his second season at Mount Union and the opportunity to work with new head coach Geoff Dartt. He wanted to be a big part of the Purple Raiders' push to an Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl in their own backyard.


   


  COVID-19 threw all that out of whack. The Ohio Athletic Conference's decision to move fall sports to the spring briefly left Thomas without a coaching job this fall.


   


  With one door closed, another opened in a hurry.


   


  Thomas will spend this fall on head coach Brian Gamble's staff at Sandy Valley High School. He will get a chance to work on the same staff with his son, Ben, for the first time. Ben Thomas is also in his first season with the Cardinals.


   


  "You spend 43 years with other people's children, and now I see my son every day," Thomas said. "I see him coaching linebackers and being with the offensive line. It has been fun for me."


   


  He spent last season coaching Mount Union's offensive line as a volunteer assistant. He lost his head coaching job at Malone in early 2019 when the university dropped football.


   


  It was Thomas' intention to coach at Mount Union one more season before retiring. He informed Dartt of his plans so he could have a replacement lined up.


   


  Gamble acted quickly when Thomas' fall suddenly opened up.


   


  "Ben said, 'Why don't we contact my dad,'" Gamble said. "I'm like 'Uh, yes, yes, let's try it.'"


   


  Thomas spent many years as Walsh's defensive coordinator before he went to Malone. Gamble had a chance to work with him during his three seasons on the Cavaliers' coaching staff.


   


  "It's unbelievable what he brings to the table," Gamble said. "The guys know a little bit about his resume, but not the whole thing. It is kind of long. The guys respect him. They were giddy when they found out he was coming on board."


   


  Thomas says he helps coach the defensive line and linebackers. When practice shifts to the offense, he walks the track.


   


  "I have my headphones and get my walk in every day," Thomas said. "You have to stay active. If you don't stay active, you lose your health."


   


  Thomas has not coached high school football since his seven-year run as GlenOak's head coach ended in 1998. He also was the head coach at Girard and Alliance.


   


  "You have to have more patience," Thomas said. "There are less numbers, but it has been fun. The kids have been great. They have accepted me. They know I'm just here and there, a little bit everywhere."


   


  Thomas will not be returning to Mount Union in the spring when the Purple Raiders resume football. His passion for the university remains strong. His daughter Mollie is a volleyball player there.


   


  "I love everything about Mount," Thomas said. "The coaches there are great coaches. The facilities are second-to-none in Division II or III.


   


  "I'm going to be 66 next year, and in my opinion it's too old (for college football). ... The recruiting and calling kids, you get to a point where you have to slow down and step back.


   


  "Fortunately now I can still stay around young people. That helps keep you young."

Mr. Sachin Nag was champion in 100 meters free style for straight 8 years of Bengal State Swimming Championships in a row, 3 times at All India Swimming Championships and the 1st Asian Champion. In the year of 1942 Mr. Nag emerged as a champion in 100 meters free style by defeating the then champion Late Mr. Dilip Mitra (another legendary swimmer of India who clocked 1 min. 04 sec.) with a timing of 1 min. 02.50 seconds. This record stood in his name for 31 years in the swimming history. An interesting fact to note w.r.t. the record is that, in 1936 Berlin Olympics, Jhonny Weismuller who shocked the sports world by winning 5 gold medals and a bronze medal in water polo clocked 59 seconds in 100 meter free style. Imagine Johnny Weissmuller clocked this time with all the latest scientific equipment’s and training, where as Mr. Sachin Nag clocked 1 min 02 seconds (or 62 seconds) without any such facility! Hereby, to mention that if had been practising with the same set of equipment’s and training of Johnny Weissmuller then possibly Mr. Nag could have won a Gold Medal at the Olympics for India.

Hemsby Broads Rescue was paged on Wednesday (August 26) to assist the man who had entered the water at Womack Island.


  As a result of the fall, he suffered injuries to his face and torso, Hemsby Lifeboat said.


  On arrival at the vessel, and with the assistance of a Broads Authority Ranger and Bacton Coastguard team, the casualty was back on board and receiving immediate aid.


  Although a little shaken the injuries were not thought to be serious, Hemsby Lifeboat said.


  With his family being looked after by members of the coastguard team, the Hemsby crew evacuated the casualty by rescue boat to the waiting ambulance for further treatment.


  Hemsby Broads Rescue then returned to base and prepare for its usual Wednesday night training.


  Also on scene with Bacton Coastguard were Winterton Coastguard team.


  Hemsby Lifeboat has thanked all those involved and the crew who remained on station at Hemsby to assist with the clean down.

“Taylor’s strong suit is blocking,” Turner said. “We are working on her consistency offensively, but she’s a strong defender for us at the middle hitter spot.”


  Based off talent alone, the Generals are sitting pretty good in the catbird seat, but the culture that Turner has put into place at Horseshoe Bend has made it easier with the upperclassmen taking on strong leadership roles. Kate Lewis and Abby Cheatham were the vocal leaders for the Generals and also stuffed the stat sheet in several categories.


  “Abby played very well for us,” Turner said. “It was her first time playing front row and she played hard.”


  Cheatham finished the night with 17 digs, three kills and a serving ace, doing it all for Horseshoe Bend. Lewis was just as good, getting eight kills, two serving aces and seven digs.


  Although the victory was a sweet one, Turner thinks the Generals have some work to do if they want to be special like they were last season when they went on a 22-game win streak.

BARS. Let's go back to a time before Iman Shumpert rapped and Shaq asked Kobe how his a-s tasted. With the new millennium fresh on his mind, Kobe already had the NBA on lock, so he turned his efforts to rapping. And who better to feature than Tyra Banks? Kobe's debut single, creatively titled "Kobe," was pushed in January 2000 and he even performed it at All-Star Weekend. The song was actually pretty catchy but Kobe's album, _Visions,_ failed to meet expectations. The song was still a hit, especially when you realize it featured two people who had made millions off careers outside of music. Kobe's opening line was, "What I live for? Basketball, beats and broads." As classic as it gets.
