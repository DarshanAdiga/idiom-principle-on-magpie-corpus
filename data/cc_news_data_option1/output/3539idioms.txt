“I ask my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to allow me to be a bridge builder,” Vincent said. “And I try to stay on the premises of educating whether that’s a player or a club owner. I just speak to humanity. And I would say in my dealings with club owners, they all have a heart. … I do believe that some of the things that we have seen transpire, they have seen transpire, it does something to the heart. And we understand we’re not asking, the players are not asking, for anything out of context and just asking for accountability to be administered and that people see this burden that many live, that an entire community, in particular the Black community, that these injustices are happening

Not honoring what you say you'll do is bad enough. When a company doesn't honor what they put in writing and thus make someone spend considerable time to come in for a hoax offer, it makes one question anything they'd put in writing, and we can rest assured that any dealings with them will cost substantially more in the long run than what they tell you.

VENICE — A for sale sign is now on two parcels where developers hoped to build a Four Points Sheraton on Tamiami Trail in Venice.
 Daus Capital unveiled a new, smaller proposed hotel in October, but it didn’t pass muster with the city Planning Commission.
 The plan was ultimately shot down by the Venice City Council as being incompatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods. And then the pandemic hit.
 Jag Grewal, of Ian Black Real Estate, said he looking at alternatives for the more than 2 acres of Commercial General zoned property, including selling it.
 The asking price is $999,000 for the larger parcel, and $389,000 for the smaller parcel, separated by a roadway, that was slated for hotel parking.
 “We followed staff suggestions on how to go about doing it, but that was soundly defeated by the City Council. People said they wanted a hotel and here was a great opportunity, but it didn’t get treated well,” Grewal said.
 There’s also the possibility of building townhouses or multi-family housing on the properties, he said.
 “We’re regrouping,” he added.
 In 2017, developers planned a four story hotel for the property, which included a variance request for seven additional feet in height, from 35 feet to 42 feet.
 Some residents from Country Club Estates, located east of the property, objected to the size and variance, citing objections to potential traffic and noise.
 Fox Lea Farms, the Venice Regional Bayfront Hotel, Visit Sarasota and a number of local business owners testified or sent letters in support of the proposed hotel.
 Daniel Singh, with Daus, previously said the hotel would have provided 400 jobs and $6 million in community impact.

It shouldn’t be surprising that most diversity programs aren’t increasing diversity. Despite a few new bells and whistles, courtesy of big data, companies are basically doubling down on the same approaches they’ve used since the 1960s—which often make things worse, not better. Firms have long relied on diversity training to reduce bias on the job, hiring tests and performance ratings to limit it in recruitment and promotions, and grievance systems to give employees a way to challenge managers. Those tools are designed to preempt lawsuits by policing managers’ thoughts and actions. Yet laboratory studies show that this kind of force-feeding can activate bias rather than stamp it out. As social scientists have found, people often rebel against rules to assert their autonomy. Try to coerce me to do X, Y, or Z, and I’ll do the opposite just to prove that I’m my own person.

When a large swath of Connecticut was forced to shut down during the early days of the pandemic, state officials created an emergency loan program from scratch, hoping to help small businesses weather the economic crisis. Months later, records obtained by The Associated Press through a Freedom of Information Act request show the fledgling Connecticut Recovery Bridge Loan Program ultimately funded 2,123 one-year, no-interest loans, averaging $19,705 a piece. Because of the massive flood of applications, officials decided to cap loan amounts at $37,500 — half of the $75,000 originally promised when the program was launched in March — to help twice the number of businesses.

The federal judge in San Jose late Saturday issued a temporary restraining order against the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department, which oversees the agency. The order stops the Census Bureau from winding down operations until a court hearing is held on Sept. 17. The head count of every U.S. resident helps determine how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is distributed and how many congressional seats each state gets.
