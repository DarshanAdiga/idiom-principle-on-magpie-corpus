The 2020 summer season officially opened for one more group of baseball players Tuesday night.
 In a modified, shortened Junior Baseball season, the Ilwaco Fishermen hosted a 17-and-under baseball doubleheader with the Warrenton Warriors in Long Beach, Washington.
 Both teams have upcoming games scheduled for most Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays through Aug. 1. Currently, all games will be played at city-owned fields in Astoria and Long Beach, with weekend games also at CMH Field.
 Tuesday’s winner was Warrenton, which cruised to a 17-7, 16-6 sweep over the Fishermen.
 The Warriors were seeing their first action of the spring or summer, and were playing their first official game since the 2019 3A state championship — although with a much different, younger lineup.

NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian needs to grow up and cede northern NSW to Queensland. Forget the 7km extension of the border. Let's go the whole hog and adopt the original border, which was the Clarence River, near Grafton. Queensland might finally win an Origin series. northern NSW is a nursery for great rugby league players.

Perhaps imposing a fine on the spot as they do in Francophone Africa will reduce the bureaucracy of arrest, prosecution and judgement. Face masks can easily be sewn by tailors and it is also not too much for governments to buy face masks for the poorest of the poor. This will certainly be cheaper in the long run to massive deaths and even our inability to give the dead the decent African burial each person by tradition deserves.

"description": "The COVID-19 pandemic which has caused tremendous loss of life around the world has been keeping scientists and doctors on their toes to find a solution. Vaccination is seen as the only hope to eliminate the deadly viral disease with many countries even breaking the norms of vaccine development to quickly bring out a preventive drug against the virus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) as many as 150 vaccine candidates are under development across the globe and around 17 of these are being tested on humans. The vaccine candidate that has grabbed the world’s attention is the one which is being developed by the University of Oxford in collaboration with British drugmaker AstraZeneca. It is expected to hit the market very soon.

The results offer an intriguing contrast with the year’s first CPE 100 survey. In early 2020, two thirds of respondents predicted that their company’s performance would be unchanged six months in the future. Those earlier results suggested mild concerns that a possible recession would put a damper on growth, as opposed to the subsequent economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus.

I had thought I wouldn’t be writing on the Coronavirus pandemic again after writing about five columns at different stages as the coronavirus pandemic hit Nigeria. I was in lockdown for four months in the Redemption Camp. I thank the Almighty God who gave the vision of the camp to Pastor E. A. Adeboye, the General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God. I also thank Pastor Adeboye who executed the vision with clinical flourish. When the inter-state roads were open, I quickly dashed to my house in Ibadan. What I saw in Ibadan worried me enormously. There seems to be no awareness of the morbidity and seriousness of this virus. I asked myself whether the people on the roads have misunderstood the now false impression that the virus only affects old people. It has now been proved that the virus is no respecter of age, gender or race.

I was told that the Oyo State government was never really determined in its enforcement of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus pandemic and its confrontation against the coronavirus and in its forcing the people to obey the well-established protocols against the coronavirus. This was unlike the measures taken in some of the neighbouring states like Ogun and Lagos states. Ekiti State also took draconian measures in imposing a lockdown on the people in other to protect them against a disease that has no cure. If we do not have original home-made strategy against the disease, we can at least borrow from international best practices. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel. I personally have kept relations and even grandchildren who are silent carriers of the virus away and at arms’ length from my home because as difficult as it may appear, I am following scientists’ advice.

RIL is not only developing JIO platforms as an independent vector but also exploring cross-function synergies with its other consumer-facing vertical i.e. Reliance Retail, which in itself is also growing at a rapid pace. In light of the above we feel compelled to raise our valuation multiples for JIO Platforms and Reliance Retail in our SOTP, thereby revising our target price to Rs 1,960/share (from Rs 1,600/share), even as we maintain our BUY rating on the stock.
