Il virus purtroppo ha alleggerito le tredicesime di tanti dipendenti del settore privato. Dall’inizio dell’emergenza, infatti, almeno 6,6 milioni di lavoratori sono finiti in cassa integrazione e molti di questi a zero ore. Questa situazione non ha consentito a tante persone di maturare il rateo mensile che definisce economicamente la gratifica, alleggerendone quindi l’importo finale di circa 100 euro per ogni mese di indennità ricevuta», ha spiegato l'Ufficio studi della Cgia di Mestre.

Ninety-five percent of me felt that I couldn’t do it and then just a small bit of me at the right time and I was ...,” Shiffrin said, her words trailing away. “It’s crazy to be back here.” She was greeted in the finish area by Brignone, who won the overall World Cup title last season after Shiffrin stopped racing to be with her family in Colorado. Brignone was in third place after the morning run and had a fast second run going. After a mistake at a left-hand turn, she slid and recovered her balance with much of her left arm scraping the snow. Television microphones in the finish area picked up Brignone lamenting her “stupid” error. After the race, Brignone and Worley spoke warmly of their rival. “I think she's really strong,” Brignone told...
