Locane was released from prison on June 12, 2015, but the controversy over her shortened sentence continues, and her time behind bars may not be over. On appeal, Judge Reed didn't change his original sentencing, leaving Locane a free woman and a distraught Fred Seeman to proclaim that the judge "bent over backwards to let her walk free," while promising that "this isn't over." He's right, with the case being appealed a second time by the state. (A spokesman for the Somerset County prosecutor's office declined to comment, saying it is an active case.)

By the time of her sentencing, Locane had already acclimated herself to a new life behind bars. "I went into county jail right after I was found guilty [in November]," she recalls. "Most people get bailed out and go home and be with their family, but I decided the sooner I got in, the sooner I would get out." She passed the time by checking out books from the prison library, but she never stayed too long in one place. First, it was a gymnasium-style room with 60 other women, followed by a maximum-security area that made her feel like she was "living in Penn Station." Next came a rehabilitation section of the prison, and then an area where she helped train puppies for work in law enforcement.

Although a handful of counties advanced in the state’s COVID-19 reopening plan Tuesday, two moved backward — the first time since California launched its tiered system that parts of the state have regressed.
 Following an increase in cases, Tehama County moved back to Tier 2, and Shasta County moved back to Tier 1, the most restrictive. The setbacks will affect business sectors that had been given the green light to reopen or expand capacity in those areas.
 Shasta County, which averaged 173.7 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents in the last seven days, and Tehama County, with 124.3 cases per 100,000 residents during the same period, are among the five counties in the state where the most new cases are concentrated, according to The Times’ tracker.
 Among the counties that moved forward was Ventura, the fourth in Southern California to advance on the state’s blueprint for reopening. It joined Merced and Yuba counties in advancing from Tier 1, also known as the purple tier, with widespread risk of the virus, to Tier 2, or the red tier, with substantial risk of the virus.

Cignolli said he has seen as increase in accidents in the city lately.
 "Drivers are much more aggressive because there aren't as many people on the road. I've noticed that a lot. I do not know, based upon the accident reports because we don't usually get this piece of it, to know whether drivers were under the influence, whether you were talking about drugs, whether your talking about alcohol, but these are all happening overnight. It's not like it's two o'clock in the afternoon, so they are all happening overnight. Every one of them, speed is a huge factor. You know, it's not someone rolling through an intersection at 10 miles per hour that hit something. These are people who are going 60, 70, 80 miles an hour that are hitting these things, so it's usually speed, it's usually on a wide open road," Cignoli explained.
 The DPW is in charge of making sure the traffic lights and signals are always up-to-date and working properly. Now, their attention has turned to fixing the damaged control boxes.
 “We take a lot of, a lot of grief from people...you know, it looks simple, and I had an argument with one of our city councilors last year because they were like 'This intersection...why can't you get this one fixed?' and I finally had to kind of drag him and show him the inside of this thing and go 'That's why.' These things are not simple by any stretch.”

 "We probably have three or four a year. That’s kind of like our average. We get a lot of traffic signals hit, whether it's a single post or a mast-arm. Those get hit a lot. The older ones that you see that are in the city that are a single post, most of them are yellow, those are the older ones. When they get hit, they snap and installing a new one of them is usually very...I don't want to say simple, but it's straight-forward. It takes us some time to do it and we do those a lot because there are a lot of accidents in the city," said Springfield DPW Director Chris Cignoli.

AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three- dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly aboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, under contract to NASA. JPL is a division of Caltech.

Goswami had mocked Deepika Padukone by quoting the content of her deposition before the Narcotics Control Bureau. The Republic TV founder had claimed that Deepika told the NCB that she was procuring ‘doob’ through her WhatsApp chat group. He had said, “Doob is a filled cigarette. This is not drugs. Then this _Dam Maaro Dam_ gang should also inform the nation that hash and weed are not drugs.”

The E-6B Mercury is a communications relay and strategic airborne command post aircraft. The plane was originally set up as a TACAMO aircraft, which stands for "Take Charge and Move Out."
 In a crisis, E-6 planes would get airborne and then unspool a wire antenna just over 5 miles long. The very low frequency band antenna allows the E-6 to communicate with the U.S. Navy's ballistic missile submarines at sea. These communications could include orders to unleash their deadly Trident D-5 nuclear-tipped missiles in retaliation against any adversary that launched a surprise attack.

Since the death of George Floyd sparked a wave of national protests, at least 42 of the 50 largest cities in the country have adopted new rules aimed at curbing abuses by the police, according to a tally by Samuel Walker, an expert on police accountability who is affiliated with the University of Nebraska Omaha. From May through August, 15 cities banned chokeholds. A dozen passed “duty-to-intervene” statutes, requiring police officers to act if they see a fellow officer endanger a civilian. Still others banned so-called “no knock” warrants or changed policies related to the use of force.

"Such criticism, even by those delivering those services, does not necessarily undermine public confidence in health-care workers or the health-care system. Indeed, it can enhance confidence."
 A few weeks after her grandfather’s death in 2015, Strom wrote on Facebook that some unnamed staff at his long-term care facility in Macklin, Sask., were not up to speed on delivering end-of-life care. She also added a link to a newspaper article on the issue.
 "I challenge the people involved in decision-making with that facility to please get All Your Staff a refresher on the topic And More … to those who made Grandpa's last years less than desirable, Please Do Better Next Time!'' one comment read.
 Some nurses at the facility reported the post. The nurses association found Strom guilty of professional misconduct in 2016 and ordered her to pay the hefty financial penalty.
 The association's lawyer had argued before the Appeal Court that Strom personally attacked an identifiable group without attempting to get all the facts about her grandfather's care.

Half a dozen bricks stood between Dave Soddy and a stopping point as he worked on some landscaping at his cottage near Stevens Point in July.
 The Milton man suddenly was not feeling well, but surely he could make it through six more stones.
 Two bricks later, Soddy had no choice but to call it quits.
 “I would never quit if I was feeling a little achy or a little queasy; I would’ve just finished it,” Soddy said. “But there was just something. There was no way. I just knew.”
 Soddy took the rest of the day off.
 He did not feel much better when he got back home to Milton. And he soon learned he had tested positive for COVID-19.
 After a few days of monitoring symptoms at home—where his wife and kids also quarantined after they, too, tested positive—Soddy again began feeling far worse. He checked himself into the hospital.
 “I was always concerned about it (COVID-19), because I just turned 60. And when it all started happening, they always talked about (people 60 and older),” Soddy said. “So we had stayed pretty clear of everybody and everything.”
 And Soddy said he did not have preexisting conditions that have been associated with many of the more dire outcomes among COVID cases.
 In fact, Soddy’s “preexisting conditions” make it that much more surprising that he wound up spending nearly two weeks in the hospital battling the virus.
 He was a state champion relay runner for Janesville Craig in high school.
 He has been coaching and officiating high school sports—including track and field, hockey and volleyball—in the area since he graduated from UW-Stevens Point.
 And while at Stevens Point, he was part of a 4x400-meter relay team that qualified for the national meet.
 “I was a 400 runner mainly, and they always say that’s the toughest race,” Soddy said. “We would do a five-mile run at a 5:30-per-mile pace for a warmup. Then maybe you’d do 10 300s or 400s at race pace. And when you’re running at nationals, you’re completely depleted.
 “But no, none of that held a candle to what I was going through with this (battling COVID).”
 And thus, as the number of positive tests, hospitalizations and deaths continue to surge in the state of Wisconsin, Soddy’s story serves as yet another reminder of the virus’ unpredictable nature.
 “One of my friends who is my age told me, ‘Gosh, Dave, I couldn’t believe you were down like that. You’re stronger than a horse,’” Soddy said. “And I told him, ‘You just don’t have any control over this.’”
 The rest of Soddy’s family suffered from much milder symptoms and recovered.
 Soddy spent 13 days in the hospital and still is not 100% recovered more than two months later. He has resumed many normal day-to-day activities but must constantly remind himself to monitor his oxygen level and take breaks when needed. He has two oxygen tanks—one for his car and one for his house—but is to the point where he said uses them rarely.
 “I’m probably 95% better, but it’s still a process” Soddy said. “Those first few nights I was home from the hospital, it was horrible. I was coughing so much, for 40 minutes at a time. I couldn’t catch my breath. It was hell.
 “My wife did a heckuva lot for me, and the kids, too. It was at a point where something had to give. I told my wife, ‘Don’t be afraid if I get to a point where I can hardly move, call the paramedics.’ I just felt so out of it.”
 Slowly but surely, Soddy has been working his way back to full health.
 He is hopeful he might be able to return to coaching this winter or fall. Much of that hinges on area teams resuming sports more so than Soddy’s health. He was set to be an assistant for Edgerton High track and field last spring before that season was halted, and he hopes to help the Tide this coming spring. He may also coach hockey if it is played this winter. He was head coach of the Rock County Fury when they made their first trip to the state tournament in 2016.
 “I enjoy helping kids out and helping out the programs,” Soddy said. “Heck, I started with track in 1984 as a volunteer coach.
 Since news of his battle with COVID-19 was first published in the Milton Courier in late July, Soddy said he has appreciated receiving well-wishes from friends and former student-athletes.
 “A lot of kids I’ve coached and a lot of my college teammates from track and my track coach. There was quite a lot of feedback, and that was pretty nice.”
 During his COVID-19 recovery, Soddy has leaned on at least one message he has always delivered to his athletes.
 “If I’m feeling a little fatigued or out of breath, I’ll take a couple minute break now and get back at it,” Soddy said. “It’s like I always told my athletes, ‘Listen to your body.’”

  _Lt. Gen. Reginald A. Centracchio (Ret.) is a former adjutant general of Rhode Island. Brig. Gen. Thomas M. Frazer (Ret.), Brig. Gen. James F. Reed III (Ret.) and Brig. Gen. James J. D'Agostino (Ret.), former assistant adjutant generals of Rhode Island, contributed to this commentary._
 Since the day the COVID-19 pandemic reached our shores, every state and territory has activated the National Guard as part of its response. Rhode Island has been no exception. As retired general officers of the Rhode Island National Guard (RING), we have followed the stories of the RING's contributions with a keen and vested interest and a tremendous amount of pride.
 Recently, I joined several of my retired general officers for a meeting with Maj. Gen. Christopher Callahan, the adjutant general of the Rhode Island National Guard. We are well versed in the challenges and tremendous responsibility of responding to state emergencies. While we had some idea of the work the RING was doing, we were amazed and humbled by what our service members have accomplished on behalf of Rhode Island. We served the state and country during the Blizzard of '78, in the aftermath of 9/11, and through the floods of 2010, but nothing in our combined experience could have predicted the invaluable role the Rhode Island National Guard has served in responding to this global pandemic.
 Earlier this year, shortly after the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the U.S., the RING began preparing for the inevitable. The first challenge was figuring out how to test Rhode Island residents for the virus safely. Almost immediately, the RING established the first mobile testing sites in the United States. Simultaneously, RING planning and operations experts were embedded into the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency (RIEMA) to expand the state's testing capacity from 60 Rhode Islanders a day to upwards of 1,000 Rhode Islanders a day.
 Within days of the declared state of emergency in March, almost 1,000 members of the Rhode Island National Guard began the largest state-side mobilization in its 382-year history. Beyond operating testing sites, members of the RING have distributed and delivered thousands of swab test kits to testing sites and provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to front-line workers, congregate care facilities, nursing homes, schools, and high-density communities. They mobilized teams to provide testing, training, and expertise at congregate care facilities and nursing homes and managed quarantine and isolations sites ensuring the health and safety of some of the most vulnerable Rhode Islanders.
 RING planners, logisticians, and operations experts assisted in the establishment of the three alternate hospital sites, increasing the state's capacity to provide quality medical care to residents. They staffed the phones at RIDOH and the Department of Administration to connect Rhode Islanders to public health information and assist in the contact tracing and case investigation. In conjunction with CVS, the RING established and operated the nation's first rapid testing site. The RING helped provide testing for our state's front-line health-care professionals and first responders and trained hundreds in how to keep themselves, their patients, and their facilities safe. Today, the men and women of the Guard are supporting the Rhode Island Department of Education and local school districts in safely opening schools for in-person learning.
 As retirees, the time with Maj. Gen. Callahan gave us tremendous confidence and pride in the organization we have all served. These young men and women represent the best of us. Though they come from every walk of life, hometown, and ethnicity, they are united in their shared commitment to building a better future for the people of Rhode Island. We walked away from our meeting with new insight and understanding, and with reborn pride in our National Guard. The people of Rhode Island are in good hands.

 I'm tired, and it shows. The bags under my eyes threaten to overtake my face; my once crisp movement is blurry, slow and methodical. I've got a bowl of chicken in my hands, marinated just this morning with anticipation of a nice dinner at the end of the day. It's ready for the grill, but I don't feel like grilling it, I just want to go to bed and call this dreadful day one to forget.
   
 What began at sunrise as a day full of possibility with a few things to do turned into an inescapable labyrinth that became more and more complex every time I "checked" my phone. Why I felt the need to check the thing escapes me; nothing that the device delivered improved my mood, my understanding or my life in any way whatsoever. Yet check I did.
   
 Something compels me to engage the stranger who likes nothing more than to insult everything I share on Facebook. His, or her, or its opinion matters, I guess, because I can't seem to erase the lack of validation from pixels on a screen from my mind. And I just had to see how President Trump's tax returns would make the people on my left crazy, while simultaneously making sure the people on my right continued to gloat about the recent Supreme Court developments.
   
 The latest Black Lives Matter protest simply could not be allowed to happen without my oh so important commentary, nor could the Proud Boys vs. antifa debacle in Portland. The Twitter War I started lasted an hour or two; actual typing time more like five minutes, but my clever little 240-character contributions to the state of the human condition took far longer to develop.
   
 As I twisted my mind around things I have no control over, and allowed them rent free space in my head the day progressed as it always does, possibilities escaped me, possible connections with the people I cherish were squandered and I became a sour, bitter man lifelessly throwing chicken on a grill.
   
 As I wallowed in the misery of my own making, something happened. From the shadows emerged a magical little spirit who had embodied the shape of a 12-pound, dirty white snaggle-toothed Schnoodle. I know that he knows that I'm shot, just going through the motions, trying to get through the day.
   
 "Whatju got there, Dad?" he asks, that mischievous little grin igniting a spark inside me that I thought was extinguished for good.
   
 "Chicken."
   
 Then I took a good look at him, and realized he did not care at all what I had.
   
 "Whajugot, Mr. Wilson?" I asked, suddenly interested in my life for the first time in hours.
   
 "Something you will never get," he says, and I notice that he is holding the most valuable thing in the world between his teeth. A stick.
   
 The chicken waits as two fools run around the yard like crazy people, one chasing the other, then the other chasing the one.
   
 "Best chicken ever, huh, Mr. Wilson" I ask my little friend an hour later as we relax by the fire, my phone forgotten for now -- full, content and happy to be alive.
   
 And he looks at me, closes his eyes and rests, his job done for another day.

On the other side, Bob Gibson went 22-9 with an unheard of 1.12 ERA.and 13 shoutouts. How could he lose nine games? In the first game of the series, Gibson struck out 17 batters and walked one, winning the game 4-0. He then won the fourth game as the Cardinals took a 3-1 series lead. However, he lost the seventh game to Mickey Lolich, who won three games in the series and was voted MVP.
 So, the rest is history as the ‘Cats” had rallied to win the last three games and the series. Naturally, many of my Michigan friends and family were ecstatic. But I was totally devastated. I have never forgotten that World Series.
 But once again alluding to Gibson, I shall ever be so mindful of what he contributed to the Cardinals over his 17 years with them, and clearly what he brought to the game. He was such a formidable foe, a menacing figure on the mound challenging the opposing batters in such a way that it was almost like he was saying, “Get a hit off me and you will pay!”
 Bob was not only a tremendous pitcher — two Cy Young awards, 251 wins — but was a very good hitting pitcher and a nine-time Gold Glove winner.
 Gibson was also an outstanding basketball player and the first Black player at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, in the late ’50s. He played briefly for the Harlem Globetrotters in late 1957. Fortunately, he was recruited that year by Bing Devine of the St. Louis Cardinals, allegedly for $4,000, to sign with them.

 The boss said, “Git’em processed, just as fast as they come in!
 A crew’ll bring’em to ya and then take’m back again.”
 So, K.T. got three cowboys and headed toward the shed,
 “You shovel out the squeeze chute, Clyde. Juan, come with me,” she said.
 They filled a gooseneck trailer with the stuff she thought they’d need.
 “We’ll inventory later, right now, all that counts is speed!”
 By eight the chute was bangin’ through the second semi load.
 The cattle to be processed stretched a mile down the road.
 Syringes on the fast draw firin’ doses of vaccine,
 Hydraulic handles flippin’ like a bad pinball machine,
 Blue smoke and buzzin’ bee stings from the hotshots and the brands,
 An ear tag like a snake bite, bawlin’ calves and flashin’ hands.
 An implant undercover, some pour-on down the back,
 Dewormer for the pore ones, dehorning with a crack.
 Release the head, a clatter. Release the squeeze, a pause.
 He bolts, but then the next one is captured in the jaws.
 On and on they processed till their hands were just a blur,
 The cattle like a carousel, the headgate just a whir.
 Above the shed an aura that so brightened up the skies
 The cowboys bringin’ new ones had to cover up their eyes.
 A vacuum was created like a swirlin’ whirlwind.
 As soon as one was turned out, it sucked the next one in.
 The final bunch was brought up, but when the last one fled.
 They couldn’t quit, their auto pilot stuck full speed ahead!
 They might have gone forever ’cept the power went haywire.
 The crew walked out like robots whose brains had caught on fire.
 They stood around unknowing, ears still ringin’ from the fray,
 So numb they could remember nothing that transpired that day.

Ryan Fitzpatrick will remain the Miami Dolphins’ starting quarterback for at least another week, further delaying the NFL debut of Tua Tagovailoa. The Dolphins announced Tuesday on Twitter that Fitzpatrick will get the nod Sunday at San Francisco. The disclosure ends speculation that coach Brian Flores was about to turn the offense over to Tagovailoa, drafted out of Alabama with the fifth overall pick as a potential franchise quarterback. Fitzpatrick recently described his career as a roller coaster, and that has been the case this season. Two of the four QBs taken in the first round of the draft are already starting.

John Boyega, finally free from the clutches of Disney and Lucasfilm, imbues Leroy with a believable idealism, and his performance goes a long way to ensuring that his awakening to the full, intractable extent of the MPS’ internal racism has the appropriate emotional punch. Same goes for Steve Toussaint, who plays Kenneth, Leroy’s strict, embittered father. McQueen and Newland characterize him as a morally righteous, yet frequently bullying man, whose bulldozing personality has rippling effects across his immediate family, not limited to his son. Toussaint’s performance embodies this internal tension without rendering it too neatly, which allows him to play tender when he quasi-reconciles with Leroy right before he leaves for police training. McQueen soundtracks the scene to Al Green’s “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?” a great song that’s too on the nose for the moment, especially in an anthology that has (so far) excelled at deploying off-the-beaten-path period music. Still, Boyega and Toussaint provide the scene with appropriate weight. Their relationship, while not dominating the film, works as its emotional fulcrum.

What's interesting is that tiny nuclear, in the form of more traditional new water reactor designs as well as (for example) TRISO pellet-fueled, low- density micro-reactors, is already planning in tandem with renewable energy. If a nuclear plant doesn't require billions of dollars and an isolated plot of land 10 miles out of town, it's a lot easier to marry into a hybrid electrical grid concept with whatever renewables are locally appropriate.
 "Our findings show not only that nuclear investments around the world tend on balance to be less effective than renewable investments at carbon emissions mitigation, but that tensions between these two strategies can further erode the effectiveness of averting climate disruption," policy researcher Andy Stirling said in the University of Sussex press release. And yes, for data up to 2014, it's easy to see that large, grid-dominating regional nuclear plants intuitively limit the investment in renewable energy.

ENGLEWOOD — State rangers didn't throw precaution to the wind when they flew a purple flag this week at Stump Pass State Beach State Park on Manasota Key.
 Color-coded flags indicate beach conditions. A purple flag indicates that sea life may be hazardous to swimmers and beachgoers.
 In this case, jellyfish floated too close to shore. Jellyfish generally are carried by currents close to Gulf beaches this time of year. They can wash up on the beach, sometimes in big numbers.
 "Currently, Gasparilla Island State Park, Cayo Costa State Park and Stump Pass Beach State Park are flying a purple flag, denoting that stinging marine life — namely jellyfish — may be present in the waters," said Alexandra Kuchta, deputy press secretary for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.
 It didn't seem to deter beachgoers, who were plentiful at the beach Tuesday.
 To greater or lesser degree, Mote Marine Laboratory's daily beach condition reports at visitbeaches.org have cautioned beachgoers when jellyfish drift into shallow waters or wash onto Gulf beaches.
 The reports Tuesday indicated "a few" jellyfish were reported in beaches throughout Sarasota County. However, the county beaches flew green flags, indicating low hazards and calm conditions.
 "Based on what lifeguards have observed at Sarasota County beaches, there is not a significant number of jellyfish," Sarasota County Emergency Management media relations officer Sara Nealeigh said Tuesday.
   
 "If a significant number were to be observed, lifeguards will fly the appropriate flag," Nealeigh said.
 No jellyfish were reported a mile north of Stump Pass Beach at Charlotte County's Englewood Beach either.
 The local jellyfish "season" generally extends from late summer into early fall. Recent reports also tell of jellyfish inundating the waters of Atlantic beaches from Florida to the Carolinas and beyond.
 In local waters, the moon jellyfish are common, so are nettle, comb and pink meanie jellyfish. The Atlantic sea nettle jellyfish — one of the most common jellyfish species found in the Gulf of Mexico — appear periodically in the shoreline waters of local beaches.
 All jellyfish can "sting" from cells, called "cnidocytes," on their tentacles that paralyze zooplankton and other prey. The intensity of the sting can vary immensely among the different species. Some stings are never felt.
 The levels of discomfort or severity from those stings may vary from person to person. Moon jellyfish stings feel like having hot pepper juices splattered on your skin, while nettle stings feel much like a bee sting that might last 45 minutes to two hours.
 If you do get stung, doctors recommend removing the stinger carefully with tweezers and soaking the stung area in hot water.

Celebration to be marked with day of activities
   
 A local legend and hero would be celebrating 130 years of life this year. Even though he died in 1969, Denison and the surrounding areas continue to celebrate the works of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   
 This year's birthday celebration for the Denison native will be just as large but will have a socially distanced them.
   
 "I think that it is important that we pass on Eisenhower's importance to our youngsters so that they can see how history has changed and he molded our society," Main Street Director Donna Dow said. "It is specifically important to us because he was born here."
   
 On Oct. 10, the city will hold its annual brick-laying ceremony for the Eisenhower monument. Festivities will begin at 8 a.m. with music and a reading for the names of the people who will have bricks laid at the site in their honor.
   
 A larger formalized ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. at the Eisenhower Auditorium at Scott Middle School. Dow said this is possible due in part to the size of the auditorium, which allows for social distancing.
   
 This year's festivities will also feature the return of the Wall of Honor throughout the month of October at the Katy Depot. The wall features 231 photos of local veterans ranging from those who served in World War I to present.
   
 Dow said that Eisenhower was always passionate about the armed forces, so it made sense to work the two events together.
   
 "We have a committee that works on the Eisenhower birthday. Of course, we are all passionate about veterans and their contributions to the freedoms we enjoy."
   
 Dwight D. Eisenhower was born in 1890 into a railroad family that had settled into a small white house near the tracks in Denison. Eisenhower's father worked with the railroad as an engine wiper.
   
 Eisenhower's stay in Denison was brief, and he moved early in life to Abilene, Kansas which he later in life referred to as his hometown. It wasn't until later in adulthood that Eisenhower would return to his birthplace.
   
 Eisenhower rose to fame through his military career, which was capped of when he became the Supreme Allied Commander during World War II, and helped orchestrate the landings on Normandy Beach -- one of the largest military operations in history.
   
 Following his military career, Eisenhower was courted by both political parties as a potential presidential candidate. Eisenhower eventually ran as a Republican candidate and was elected as the 34th President of the United States in 1952.
   
 Other contributions of Eisenhower include his work in the establishment of NASA and his work in creation an interstate highway system.
   
 "He made such an impact on American society and we are blessed to have that connection," Dow said. "Sure there is a tourism aspect, but for a lot of people it is much more personal than that.
   
 "It is about how you can be born in a house by the railroad tracks, not have family wealth, and still work hard and become a great world leader and president. To me, it is a message of hope and a message of pride."
   
 Traditionally, students with Denison Independent School District would conduct field trips to the birthplace as a part of the anniversary. However, COVID-19 led organizers to instead focus on in class study and presentations this year.
   
 "So, we are going to be doing more things to feature his visits to Denison in the future," Dow said, referring to a trip Eisenhower made as a hero to his birthplace where he was served breakfast with U.S. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn.
   
 "We always like to showcase the Texas Big Breakfast because it also highlights our volunteers and we tie that in because it took volunteers and local citizenry to preserve the birthplace and we are very fortunate that that occurred."

Regardless of who owned it, the pier has struggled for years, due in part to its location jutting out over the ocean across the Boardwalk from Caesars casino. Guests either had to find a parking space in a parking garage the casino also shares with a hospital, or find a space in a lot blocks away and walk to the pier.
 Nonetheless, Starr's two restaurants there consistently won rave reviews from customers and were regarded as among Atlantic City's top eateries. Diners went online Tuesday afternoon to lament the absence of The Continental's Brussels sprouts and wasabi mashed potatoes, and the oversized martinis that often accompanied them.
 Kris Neff, executive chef at The Continental, said the months-long closure because of the virus, and the lack of foot traffic made it difficult to survive.
 “The occupancy in Atlantic City, for sure, would not have been there, not being able to host the large conferences and concerts that enable us to be profitable," he said. “As far as destination restaurants in Atlantic City go, this is definitely a big loss.”
 He plans to launch a private chef business shortly.
 In a statement, Caesars Entertainment said the businesses were “certainly two of Atlantic City’s premier restaurants.”
 “We will certainly miss the great food, exceptional service, and most importantly, the great team of people who worked there, the statement read. ”We wish them much success.”

The new indoor occupancy limits range between 20% of maximum occupancy to 10%, depending on the size of a facility. The outdoor crowd limit now ranges between 25 and 15% of maximum occupancy.
 The changes are making a lot of high school football fans happy in the Canon- McMillan School District in Washington County, its athletic director Frank Vulcano said.
 "Yes. It's definitely making people happy," Vulcano said.
 He said the district's stadium seats 4,000 people, meaning that 800 fans will be allowed to attend Friday's game, including about 80 students.
 Most school districts didn't "open the flood gates" to football games after a federal judge in Pittsburgh ruled Sept. 14 Wolf's original crowd limit order unconstitutional, Laurel Highlands' Wallace said. An appeals court later stayed the judge's order.

Los Angeles police officials on Tuesday promised improvements to the LAPD’s process for accepting donations from outside organizations and foundations — which they did to the tune of nearly $10 million last year — after two audits identified issues with documenting and tracking such gifts.
 The findings of both reviews were presented to the Police Commission during a virtual meeting Tuesday.
 The first, conducted by LAPD Inspector General Mark Smith and his staff, found the L.A. Police Department‘s overall process for accepting gifts was “generally well designed,” but that there also were “areas of inconsistency and confusion.”
 When outside money came into the department, it wasn’t always clear whether or how it had been solicited by department officials. At times, other basic information — such as who was cutting the checks — wasn’t known or tracked. Some private foundations promised donors special access to LAPD commanders.

So, what to do with the house?
 "We understand preserving the house but we also want to look at selling the property," said attorney Frederick Grady on behalf of his mother, Betty. "We’ll give the house away if someone can move it to a location that the Commission is happy with."
 The Commission voted Sept. 14 that the house could be demolished with Mahler being the only one present in contention, allowing for a 30-day delay in case someone stepped forward to claim the house.
 But claiming the house doesn't run cheap.
 "The problem is the house is really in bad shape," Frederick said. "The floors are falling in, the sides are weak. My parents (who bought the property in 1970) spent a lot of money over the years to try to keep it going but you just can’t save everything."
 Frederick went on to say that the house was officially condemned by the city sometime within the past two months.
 Despite the house being free, repairs alone would run almost $80,000, according to an estimate provided by R.D. Welch Company to the owner.
 An additional $16,000 to $22,000 would have to be spent to paint the interior and exterior of the house, according to an Aug. 27 email from A Vance Services to Frederick.
   
 "We estimate the cost for this move to be around $45,000," Mahler said, based on numbers provided by Johnson Housemovers.
 Mahler said they would most likely have to remove a wing of the house, "which would probably have to be done at $5,000 with the addition of a new foundation to be between $25,000 to $30,000."
 Mahler based the house's 1905 construction date on information provided by DeSoto County Property Appraiser David Williams.
 In an Aug. 14 letter to Mahler, Williams wrote that he reviewed the county's historical tax rolls from 1904 through 1909 and concluded that "the residence was most likely constructed in the 1905 calendar and was assessed for the first time in the 1906 tax year."
 Mahler went on to say that they believe the house was built by Simeon Elias Whidden.
 In an obituary published by _The Tampa Tribune_ in 1923, it was noted that Simeon was "one of Arcadia’s most substantial, reliable, respected and beloved men. He had lived here ever since the town started and was a charter member of the Baptist Church, in which he was the senior deacon."
 In the obituary, it was also written that he was in the cattle business all his life and had a farm and orange groves, "among other interests."
 The house's design and features are also of historic significance, according to Mahler.
 "If you see the window trim, they made these triangular pediments above the windows and the doors," Mahler said. "That is one of those architectural styles that really marks up this building as unique. The front gable (between the roof pitches), again, it's set up more like what would be called a Greek pediment adding to this as an old, classical style building."
 The land buyer, Adam Sorrells, owner of Animal Ark of Arcadia, wants to use the land to relocate his veterinarian facility currently located at 109 S. Desoto Ave. in Arcadia.
 "It would be great if someone was willing to pay to move it," Sorrells said. "Unfortunately, the house is condemned and I think it will be difficult to find someone willing and able to do it.
 "I would like to improve our downtown by building something that fits the look of the area, will be well maintained and will provide our community with a much-needed service."
 For more information on the house or how to claim it, call 863-494-9009.
 "This is a humble house," Mahler said. "Historic preservation is important, especially to a city like Arcadia. People come here because they love to see the old buildings and if we don't protect and preserve them, we're going to lose that economic engine here in the city."

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Two popular and highly regarded restaurants in Atlantic City will remain closed permanently, victims of the coronavirus and the restrictions that came with it.
 Philadelphia restaurateur Stephen Starr told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Buddakan and The Continental, which have been closed since mid-March, will not reopen.
 Both were located inside the former Playground Pier, which Caesars Entertainment recently repurchased from developer Bart Blatstein. The pier has had extremely low levels of foot traffic and a majority of its stores have been empty for more than a year.
 The two eateries combined employed more than 100 people. Employees were notified late Monday that the businesses would not reopen.
 “It was a nice run, but we had to say goodbye,” said Starr, who operates high- profile restaurants in Philadelphia, New York, Washington and Paris that remain in business.
 “We couldn't continue in this environment with the coronavirus and the current state of the pier,” he said. “There was barely anyone left there except us.”

D'Arnaud, who played for the Mets, Dodgers and Rays last year, began the day as a .169 career hitter in the postseason, striking out 27 times in 83 at- bats.
 But the Braves weren’t done yet.
 James Hoyt replaced Garcia with one out and Swanson sent his first pitch off the wall in center field for a two-run homer.
 Acuña got things going for the Braves in the bottom of the first when he sent Alcantara’s second pitch into right-center for a homer. He watched it for a second before flipping his bat and rounding the bases as he became the youngest player (22 years, 293 days old) in postseason history with a leadoff home run.
 The Braves, who have long dominated the Marlins in the NL East, improved to 3-0 this postseason after sweeping the Reds in the wild-card round for their first playoff series win since 2001.
 The Marlins overcame a coronavirus outbreak that sidelined more than half the team in July to make the playoffs for the first time since 2003 before sweeping their wild-card series against the Cubs.
 And the scrappy Marlins, who lost 105 games in 2019, looked good early in this one, using a three-run third inning to take a 4-1 lead. But their offense stalled after that and the Braves scored two in the third to get within one before putting Miami away with their home run barrage in the seventh.

PITTSBURG, Kan. -- It's debate season in the US, and Pittsburg is no exception. On Monday evening, Rep. Monica Murnan, D-Pittsburg, and Republican Charles "Chuck" Smith who are running for the District 3 seat in the Kansas House of Representatives sat down in Pittsburg City Hall to discuss hot button issues affecting southeast Kansans.
   
 The candidates had three prepared questions, six from the public as well as an opening and a closing statement. They had two minutes to answer every question. From expanding Medicaid to the Highway 69 project, moderator Blake Benson led the candidates through a wide range of topics.
   
 First, they discussed the state's response to the current public health crisis.
   
 Smith, who served District 3 from 2015 to 2017 when Murnan took over, advocated for opening up the state again. Specifically, as a former educator, he discussed how important it is for children to be in schools.
   
 "We closed our schools, we closed our businesses and we thought we were doing the right thing, but probably that was the worst thing we could have done. Kids need to go to school," he said.
   
 Smith even said he was thrilled that his grandson, who is staying with him, is going to school despite the risk it poses to himself.
   
 "I'm the one that is in danger," he said. "If my grandson brings that virus home from school, I'm ready for it. That's a chance I am willing to take."
   
 Murnan, who has served as the District 3 representative since she defeated Smith in 2016, agreed that it would be great for schools and for businesses to be able to open again, but said that it's important to consider the whole picture.
   
 "The word public is there for a purpose. It's for the common good, it's for the good of the many over the good of the few," she said.
   
 Murnan also discussed what she said the pandemic has taught us.
   
 "The role of government is leveling the playing field for all," she said. "I think that this public health crisis has shown us that the field is not level for all."
   
 The debate then moved to Medicaid expansion. Something that most of the surrounding states have adopted in some capacity, and something the Kansas legislature is firing up to work on in the upcoming session.
   
 Murnan reminded the public that she supports Medicaid expansion and that she has since virtually day one.
   
 "It fills in a gap," she said. "It fills in the gap with a specific group of people. It fills in gaps and anytime we are trying to make a strong community you have to watch your gaps."
   
 She also said it just makes good economic sense.
   
 "We are just leaving money on the table on a daily basis. So if you don't buy the humanity component of it, you've got to buy the economic impact. As of today, we as a state have left $4.3 billion on the table that is going to other states. That doesn't make economic sense," she said.
   
 Smith on the other hand said that while he would love to help the people that need it, the state simply cannot afford it.
   
 "It's not that I don't want to help people, it's just going to cost us money that we don't have and the federal government can't give money away that they don't have," he said.
   
 He said that the money to fund the expansion would just fall to future generations.
   
 "That's just a loan and my grandson is going to have to pay it back in 30 years," Smith said. "We are really jeopardizing our grandchildren's future, which isn't fair at all."
   
 The candidates also discussed the Highway 69 expansion project which has been in the works for decades. Both agreed with the current state of things--and a projected $1.4 billion state deficit by 2022--they are going to have to fight tooth and nail to get that project to the finish line.
   
 "I know the businesses in Pittsburg need it," Smith said. "They have been promising us this for 20 years, but I think it's going to be a while longer before it gets built. But I will do everything in my power to get it done."
   
 "The hard facts are we will have to look at every transportation plan harder than before," Murnan said. "I will continue to work with everybody possible to get this off the checklist because it needs to be done."
   
 Later in the debate, the conversation drifted back to that projected deficit. Murnan said it's not a huge shock that the deficit could be that large since they have been digging the state out of the "hole" that the former Governor Sam Brownback created, a policy that she said Smith supported. Smith fired back saying that until the pandemic, the state was doing fine.
   
 "They are still blaming Brownback for everything," Smith said.
   
 The debate also touched on other topics like education -- not surprising as both candidates are former educators.
   
 Smith said if elected he would push for more of an emphasis on alternate routes to college like trade schools.
   
 "What we did as a state is we kind of made everyone go towards a college prep, and I think that's a mistake," he said. "I think it's great that everyone can go to college, that everyone can get a college degree, but that doesn't get you a job."
   
 Murnan agreed that education in Kansas does need to change.
   
 "Public education is the great equalizer, it is, it always has been," she said. "We can't keep doing business the way we've been doing it forever. It's not 1975 anymore, we have to adapt."
   
 The candidates also touched on how they have regularly reached across the aisle to get the job done.
   
 Murnan talked about her work with the women's caucus group to work through the Brownback tax experiment.
   
 "If it doesn't happen every day you're not doing a good job," she said. "If you're only talking to people that you agree with, you might as well just stay here."
   
 Smith talked about how he voted during his time in the legislature, and how he requested to sit near the Democratic members of the house so he could talk with them.
   
 "Pittsburg is 50 Democrat, 50 Republican and I think it's important that I represent both sides," he said.
   
 Then came time for the closing arguments.
   
 Murnan spent her two minutes talking about her qualifications and what she would continue doing if the people of Pittsburg voted for her.
   
 "I have the capacity to do the job," she said. "I want to do the job because I believe that once you get to Topeka our voice here in the southeast is awfully quiet and I don't like that and so I want to be that voice and I want to continue to be the voice."
   
 Smith spent his time talking about how Murnan is not their voice up in Topeka since the Republicans have such a majority.
   
 "With my opponent, we don't have a voice in Topeka," he said.
   
 Smith also spent his closing argument discussing abortion, an issue he said he cares very deeply about, even going as far as to cite a beloved children's story in his argument.
   
 "In 'The Lorax,' he says 'I speak for the trees,'" Smith said. "Well, I speak for the unborn babies."

The Grant family is calling for felony murder charges to be filed against former BART officer Anthony Pirone, according to The Mercury News, which first reported the Grant murder investigation was being reexamined.
 "Absolutely we are hopeful that Nancy O'Malley and her team will do the right thing, and the right thing is to convict Pirone for his actions in causing my son to lose his life and be killed," Wanda Johnson, Grant's mother, told the _Mercury News_.
 Pirone, who was fired but never charged in the incident, used his knee to pin Grant down. It was in a manner similar to that of the then-police officer in Minneapolis who is facing a second-degree murder charge in the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd this year.
 "We've continued to stay ... engaged with the Grant Family as BART has worked to implement progressive policing reform over the years in response to the tragic killing of Oscar Grant," Alicia Trost, a BART Chief Communications Officer said in a statement emailed to NPR.
 The statement went on to say it settled a civil lawsuit with the Grant family roughly a decade ago. Additionally it said Pirone and the officer who shot Grant, Johannes Mehserle, are no longer with the transit agency.
 Grant's mother and daughter received a combined $2.8 million settlement with BART.
 In 2019 officials released a long-sealed internal affairs investigation of what lead to Grant's death. It called Pirone's actions "aggressive and unreasonable" and added that he used a racial slur when detaining Grant.
 "Pirone was, in large part, responsible for setting the events in motion that created a chaotic and tense situation on the platform, setting the stage, even if inadvertent, for the shooting of Oscar Grant," the report states.

 In previous years, Geaux Vote hosted a celebration on campus in Free Speech Alley on National Voter Registration Day, but the club had to alter their plans now that COVID-19 testing is conducted nearby.
 Geaux Vote’s executive team is remaining positive and plans to form an informational hub in Free Speech Alley and possibly near the LSU Library to answer students’ questions and hand out stamps for mail-in ballots.
 “It’s not what we wanted to do, but it’s a great opportunity for our new members or members who haven’t been as involved in the past to get comfortable with information,” LeJune said.
 While online meetings provide the best option for keeping members healthy, the format can also present some obstacles.
 Political science senior Laura Proulx, president of Feminists in Action, combated frustrations with the Zoom format with creative meeting themes such as show and tell, movie night and dinner party.
 “It’s a little more difficult to convince members to attend Zoom meetings when they’ve likely been on Zoom all day for class,” Proulx said. “We’re working on making [meetings] fun so that members look forward to getting on Zoom at the end of the day.”

Annan Athletic made it a hat-trick of cup successes over Hamilton with a 3-1 win in their Betfred Cup group opener.
 League Two outfit Annan had defeated Hamilton on their previous two visits to Galabank, in the Scottish Cup in 2016 and the Betfred Cup two years later.
 And they produced another cup shock against their Premiership opponents following three goals in 11 first-half minutes through captain Steven Swinglehurst, Tyler Fulton and Jack Purdue.
 Hamilton pulled one back through Scott McMann early in the second half but Annan saw the tie out to claim the three points.
 Hamilton dominated the opening exchanges of this Betfred Cup group stage encounter with Marios Ogkmpoe going close as he had a header cleared off the line by Lewis Hunter.
 Hakeem Odoffin then went close on a couple of occasions for Hamilton. The big defender had a goalbound effort cleared by Swinglehurt and then from a David Templeton corner glanced a free header just wide.
 Annan soaked up the pressure and then hit Hamilton with three goals in an 11-minute spell.
 Their opener came after 31 minutes when Nathan Flanagan gathered a Purdue corner just outside the penalty area and drilled the ball into the box where Swinglehurt was in the right place to finish off from close range.
 Just six minutes later the League Two outfit doubled their advantage when Fulton’s looping header from another Purdue corner was misjudged by Hamilton goalkeeper Kyle Gourlay as it slipped through his grasp.
 It got even worse for Hamilton when Annan claimed a third after 42 minutes through the impressive Purdue. The winger cut in from the left flank and beat a couple of Accies players before rifling a powerful shot beyond Gourlay.
 Hamilton needed to react following the interval and they cut the deficit after 50 minutes when McMann got on the end of a Templeton corner to divert the ball beyond Jordan Pettigrew.
 They should have claimed a second when Callum Smith sent a free header from a Templeton free-kick over the top and paid the price as Annan secured another cup win.

DENVER (AP) — An independent municipal panel on Tuesday upheld the termination of a Colorado police officer fired for not assisting a restrained Black woman who begged for help after she became lodged upside down in the back of his patrol car.
 In a written ruling, Aurora’s civil service commission said Levi Huffine’s “callous and intentional disregard” for Shataeah Kelly’s safety and well-being last year was so egregious that it merited termination despite him not having serious disciplinary problems before.
 “Petitioner’s demonstration of inhumanity to Ms. Kelly will undoubtedly bring the Department into direct disrepute in the eyes of the public as the video of what transpired is viewed by more and more of the public,” the decision said.
 The department in the city near Denver has already been under scrutiny because of last year’s death of Elijah McClain, a Black man confronted by police after someone reported him as suspicious, and the handcuffing of Black girls pulled from a wrongfully suspected stolen car this summer.
 During a hearing last week, the commission watched body camera footage that shows Kelly falling head-first off the back seat of the cruiser while hobbled — her ankles and wrists restrained behind her and attached to a nylon band around her waist.
 While she initially berates Huffine after being placed in the restraint for 21 minutes after she fell, she pleads with Huffine, repeatedly saying she can not breathe and that her neck is breaking. Later, she says she cannot believe she is “suffering like this for being Black” and addresses the officer as “master.”

The duo was in last place after Saturday’s round in Buena Vista. On Sunday they rebounded to shoot the best score of the day at the Salida Golf Club, a 61, but weren’t quite able to catch the top two teams.
 “We just hammed and egged it, played our game and we shot the lowest score for the day,” Tidechild said. “I wanted that hat trick, but we finished one out.”
 Tidechild and Johnson finished third with a 127 net score.
 Marc Martellaro and Phil Gardunio shot a 126 over the two days to tie Bob Repola and Dave Chelf for first in the tournament.
 Josh Bechtel and Russ Johnson finished fourth with a 128.
 Three times tied for fifth in the first flight at 129, including Nick Lusero and Brian Sharrar, Cassidy Cordova and Marcus Scanga and Mason Dotter and Val Kneinast.
 Tidechild has also won the last two spring two-person tournaments and will try and three-peat in the event next year now that his Aspen Leaf streak got snapped.
 In the second flight, Manny Ochoa and Kevin Hoyt shot a 58 on both courses to take first. They said it was their first time playing in Buena Vista and said they “love both courses” in the tournament.
 Their 116 net score was also the lowest in the tournament.
 “This was the best I’ve played in my life,” Ochoa said. “My five birdies (Sunday) were the most I’ve ever made.”
 “I think someone else was in his body,” Hoyt joked. “That wasn’t him.”
 Hoyt also had a birdie Sunday on hole No. 8.
 Donny and Kevin Rice finished second with a 127, tieing Abe Hachmann and Chris Mertes.
 Five teams tied for fourth at 130, including Starr Westphal and Jared McDonald, Roger Ward and Mike Gary, Bobby Laughlin and Cody Sparrow, Art Gentile and Jeff Thulson and Mike Garner and Brian Laughlin.
 Closest to the pin titles went to Eric Johnson and Jack Hadley.
 While the first two flights were playing in Salida, the third, fourth and fifth flights were wrapping up in Buena Vista.
 Seth Watson and his partner Kevin Kasper tied Kirby O’Conner and Mark Glasby for first in the third flight.
 Bill Hocking and Jennifer Hocking won the fourth flight.
 Kenny Martinez and Tawny Peyton, meanwhile, won the fifth flight. Scores from the third through fifth flights were unavailable at press time.
 The tournament also marked the end of the competition season at the Salida Golf Club.

Lt. Gen. Reginald A. Centracchio (Ret.) is a former adjutant general of Rhode Island. Brig. Gen. Thomas M. Frazer (Ret.), Brig. Gen. James F. Reed III (Ret.) and Brig. Gen. James J. D'Agostino (Ret.), former assistant adjutant generals of Rhode Island, contributed to this commentary.
   
 Since the day the COVID-19 pandemic reached our shores, every state and territory has activated the National Guard as part of its response. Rhode Island has been no exception. As retired general officers of the Rhode Island National Guard (RING), we have followed the stories of the RING's contributions with a keen and vested interest and a tremendous amount of pride.
   
 Recently, I joined several of my retired general officers for a meeting with Maj. Gen. Christopher Callahan, the adjutant general of the Rhode Island National Guard. We are well versed in the challenges and tremendous responsibility of responding to state emergencies. While we had some idea of the work the RING was doing, we were amazed and humbled by what our service members have accomplished on behalf of Rhode Island. We served the state and country during the Blizzard of '78, in the aftermath of 9/11, and through the floods of 2010, but nothing in our combined experience could have predicted the invaluable role the Rhode Island National Guard has served in responding to this global pandemic.
   
 Earlier this year, shortly after the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the U.S., the RING began preparing for the inevitable. The first challenge was figuring out how to test Rhode Island residents for the virus safely. Almost immediately, the RING established the first mobile testing sites in the United States. Simultaneously, RING planning and operations experts were embedded into the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency (RIEMA) to expand the state's testing capacity from 60 Rhode Islanders a day to upwards of 1,000 Rhode Islanders a day.
   
 Within days of the declared state of emergency in March, almost 1,000 members of the Rhode Island National Guard began the largest state-side mobilization in its 382-year history. Beyond operating testing sites, members of the RING have distributed and delivered thousands of swab test kits to testing sites and provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to front-line workers, congregate care facilities, nursing homes, schools, and high-density communities. They mobilized teams to provide testing, training, and expertise at congregate care facilities and nursing homes and managed quarantine and isolations sites ensuring the health and safety of some of the most vulnerable Rhode Islanders.
   
 RING planners, logisticians, and operations experts assisted in the establishment of the three alternate hospital sites, increasing the state's capacity to provide quality medical care to residents. They staffed the phones at RIDOH and the Department of Administration to connect Rhode Islanders to public health information and assist in the contact tracing and case investigation. In conjunction with CVS, the RING established and operated the nation's first rapid testing site. The RING helped provide testing for our state's front-line health-care professionals and first responders and trained hundreds in how to keep themselves, their patients, and their facilities safe. Today, the men and women of the Guard are supporting the Rhode Island Department of Education and local school districts in safely opening schools for in-person learning.
   
 As retirees, the time with Maj. Gen. Callahan gave us tremendous confidence and pride in the organization we have all served. These young men and women represent the best of us. Though they come from every walk of life, hometown, and ethnicity, they are united in their shared commitment to building a better future for the people of Rhode Island. We walked away from our meeting with new insight and understanding, and with reborn pride in our National Guard. The people of Rhode Island are in good hands.

Doctors on Twitter are grumbling that Sean Conley’s been slippery before about Trump’s condition and that he’s notably terse in this new memo. Nothing about the president’s lungs, nothing about supplemental oxygen, nothing about the drugs he’s taking. Depending upon how suspicious you are, you might read extra meaning into the word “reports” too. That suggests Conley is deferring to Trump’s account of what he’s experiencing instead of describing what he’s observing independently.

NASHVILLE – Dr. Scott Niswonger, a Tusculum University alumnus and board of trustees member who has built highly successful companies and transformed the lives of children and young adults through extensive philanthropy, has been named to the inaugural class of the Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association (TICUA) Hall of Fame, a press release from Tusculum said.
 Co-founder of Landair Services and the creator of Forward Air Corp., Niswonger has played an integral role in the growth and market position of these two companies, which today have sales of more than $2 billion. As a philanthropist, he has donated more than $60 million to Tusculum, created the Niswonger Foundation and served as the stimulus for and major benefactor of Niswonger Children’s Hospital in Johnson City. He has also contributed to cultural enrichment with his advocacy and financial support for performing arts centers in Greeneville and Van Wert, Ohio, his hometown, the release said.
 “Dr. Niswonger is one of the most accomplished businessmen and philanthropists in Tennessee, but his influence and generosity extend well beyond our state’s borders,” said Dr. Scott Hummel, Tusculum’s president. “He has demonstrated remarkable business leadership and profoundly impacted people’s lives for the better, all while remembering his roots. We are proud he is an alumnus and board member and thank him for his vision, which has strengthened Tusculum considerably.”
 TICUA created the Hall of Fame to honor distinguished alumni of its 35-member institutions while highlighting their contributions to the state, nation and world. Others joining Dr. Niswonger as the first Hall of Fame entrants include the late civil rights icon John Lewis, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham and U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark.
 Niswonger said he is grateful to be selected for the Hall of Fame.
 “Whatever success in business I’ve achieved, I owe in large measure to others, including educational institutions such as Tusculum,” he said. “I am extremely fortunate to have the opportunity to invest in children and young adults in such a meaningful way. Today’s youth are tomorrow’s leaders, and if we can address their pressing health needs and provide programs and facilities that prepare them to be career-ready professionals, we are accomplishing really important missions.”
 After graduating from Purdue University in 1968, Niswonger moved to Greeneville as the corporate pilot for Magnavox Co.’s president. In 1973, he started a cargo airline, General Aviation Inc., and after selling it, he became vice president of North American operations for Flying Tiger Lines. Then he transitioned to Landair and Forward Air, which became the first two companies to be taken public in the 224-year history of Greene County, the release said.
 Niswonger’s connection with Tusculum began in the 1980s after he sold General Aviation and was entering the next phase of his career. He held a degree in aviation technology from Purdue but had not taken accounting, finance or marketing courses. According to the release he contacted Tusculum to learn whether he could just audit those courses and was told if he took them and three other courses for credit, he could earn a bachelor of science in business administration.
 “I’ve looked at a lot of balance sheets over the past 40 years, and the accounting and finance courses gave me a good basis for understanding those principles,” Niswonger said. “The program was geared toward working adults, and the flexibility enabled me to maintain my busy daily schedule and enhance my skill set. That began my love for what was then Tusculum College and today is Tusculum University.”
 After he graduated from Tusculum in 1986, Niswonger was invited to become a member of the board of trustees. As he learned more about the university, he realized Tusculum had many needs for it to grow and meet various requirements. During his 30 years on the board, the release said Niswonger has stepped forward with his financial resources to support expansion and renovation of the Thomas J. Garland Library, construction of the Scott M. Niswonger Commons and major upgrades to athletic facilities.
 Tusculum awarded Niswonger a doctorate of humane letters in 2006. He also holds an honorary doctorate of humane letters from East Tennessee State University, a doctorate of humane letters from the University of Tennessee as well as a doctor of technology from Purdue, the release said. He serves as chairman of the ETSU board of trustees and sits on multiple councils and boards for Purdue.
 Another major educational passion for him is the Niswonger Foundation, which he established in 2001 and is guided by his well-known philosophy of “Learn – Earn – Return.” The foundation focuses on Pre-K through 12th grade school partnerships to ensure rigorous, cost-effective and sustainable educational opportunities with an emphasis on rural public school needs.
 The foundation’s scholarship and leadership program is developing the next generation of leaders to serve Northeast Tennessee, the release said. There are currently 20 scholars in universities across America and 81 alumni.
 The children’s hospital is the only one of its kind in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. It holds one of only eight St. Jude affiliate clinics in the world and offers more than 20 pediatric subspecialties, including pediatric pulmonology, pediatric cardiology, pediatric surgery and pediatric oncology. Niswonger Children’s Hospital is part of Ballad Health, a 21-hospital, 15,000-employee health care enterprise of which Niswonger is a board member.
 Niswonger believes exposure to the arts is essential for quality of life, and he has taken the initiative with his support of the two performing arts centers, the release said. Both centers bear the name Niswonger Performing Arts Center. The Greeneville center provides a wide selection of programming, including musical artists in multiple genres and touring theatrical performances. It serves as the primary performance venue for local students participating in band and choral programs and offers school day educational performances benefiting children throughout the region.
 “The inaugural class of the TICUA Hall of Fame features a diverse and incredibly impressive group of citizens that our institutions have helped prepare,” said Dr. Claude Pressnell, TICUA’s president. “While you will recognize many of the names, all of these alumni have made significant contributions worth learning about. We are proud to be able to give them just a small portion of the recognition they deserve.”

In response, Soboroff suggested that the department may have to “double down” on its reliance on outside giving.
 “We [are] gonna have to double down with the foundation for the technology, training and stuff we need to move forward, while at the same time continuing to rethink and reimagine the big picture (like we have been doing),” Soboroff wrote. “I am so concerned about crime rates, rank and file morale, recruitment and retention.”
 Soboroff is among the commissioners who have been criticized by activists for what the activists perceive as a conflict of interest related to outside giving — namely for his sitting on the board of the Weingart Foundation, which donates to the police foundation and, therefore, to the LAPD.
 On Tuesday, Soboroff said he recuses himself from Weingart votes on such donations, and always acts with the best interest of police officers and Los Angeles residents in mind.

A Louisiana native, growing up in Grand Cane, Mr. Cook received BS degrees in Mathematics in 1950 and Petroleum Engineering in 1955 at Louisiana State University, the latter after a tour of duty in the US Army as a First Lieutenant stationed in Germany. Later, while working, he finished an MBA program at Southern Methodist University in 1965. Mr. Cook's professional career began in 1956 as an engineering trainee with Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO). He quickly ascended the corporate ladder, eventually becoming the CEO and Chairman of the Board. Under his leadership, ARCO was hailed as the Best-Managed U.S. Company, with profit margins approached by few and returns on equity equaled by none. In 1988 he was featured on the cover of Forbes magazine for his negotiating skills and leadership. After 39 years with ARCO, he retired in 1995 and was named Chairman Emeritus. From 1998 to 2002, Mr. Cook was Co-Chairman of Global Crossing, Ltd. which built the first global fiber-optic telecommunications network connecting over 200 cities.

Bush, and Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards, celebrated the opening of the new facility, which he envisioned would open doors for many alumni and future graduates. Mr. Cook and his wife, Carole made the lead gift for construction of the Lod & Carole Cook Conference Center, also known as The Cook Hotel located on the LSU campus. The facility, the only privately owned and operated alumni association hotel in the country, was dedicated on Oct. 21, 2001. Mr. Cook was named a Louisiana Legend by Louisiana Public Broadcasting in 1995. Mr. Cook's philanthropy had a particular focus on education, youth and minority programs. He was a Trustee of the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and former Chairman and Lifetime Trustee of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. He was also a member of the Chancellor's Court of Benefactors at Oxford University in England, and served on the board of advisors of the Carter Center of Emory University Board of Directors. In 1994, upon appointment by HM Queen Elizabeth II, Mr. Cook was invested by Prince Charles with the insignia of Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his contribution to Anglo-American relations and support for philanthropic projects around the world. In 2001, the Points of Light Foundation presented Mr. Cook with the first George Bush Corporate Leadership Award for his leadership role in supporting employee volunteerism and corporate citizenship. Since 1970 Mr. Cook and his family have resided in the Los Angeles area. His local community interests include serving as a member of the Library Foundation of Los Angeles (of which he was Founder Chairman) and Life Regent of Pepperdine University.

Series Summary: The Cardinals are back in the playoffs after reaching the NL Championship Series last season. They overcame some long odds to do it, too. Injuries have robbed them of RHP Dakota Hudson, RHP Carlos Martinez and several other pieces in their bullpen. A COVID-19 outbreak early in the season halted the schedule for 17 days, and that led to them playing 53 games in 44 days. They clinched a playoff spot on the final day of the season with a win over Milwaukee. The Cardinals ended up playing just 58 of 60 scheduled games because two makeup games slated for Monday in Detroit were unnecessary to determine the playoff field. They have played 11 doubleheaders this year and finished the regular season without a day off since Sept. 9. … The Cardinals have never lost to San Diego in the postseason, eliminating the Padres in each of their last two trips in the 2005 NLDS and 2006 NLDS. The Cardinals also beat the Padres in the 1996 NLDS. … Flaherty has struggled after a breakout season a year ago, but he has been dominant against San Diego, going 1-0 with a 1.10 ERA in three career starts. The Cardinals will need Flaherty and the rest of the rotation (3.86 ERA) and bullpen (4.06 ERA) to slow down San Diego's potent offense given their own inconsistency at the plate. St. Louis hit just .234 with 51 homers during the regular season.
