Nicholas Pooran and Rostan Chase have been named as vice captains for respective T20I and Test series which the West Indies cricket team will be playing against New Zealand, Cricket West Indies announced on Thursday. Kieron Pollard will lead the side in three match T20I series while Jason Holder will be performing captain s duties in the two Test matches. Roston Chase has been appointed vice captain of the West Indies Test team for this tour of New Zealand. He is an experienced player who is tactically aware and very purposeful in his approach to the game. He is readily willing to offer advice and discuss ideas with his fellow players and the coaches and I think will offer good leadership support to captain Jason Holder both on and off the field, said Roger Harper, CWI s lead selector. Nicholas Pooran continues in the role of vice captain of the T20I Team for the tour of New Zealand. He was first named vice captain for this format for the series against Afghanistan in 2019, he added. All rounder Chase has so far played 35 Test matches, scoring five centuries and collecting three five wicket hauls with his off spin bowling. I have been making strides in Test cricket since my debut back in 2016 and I see this new role as vice captain as an honour. It is just for me to try and carry on and try to achieve great things for West Indies. It is all about offering support to the captain, coach and other players as we try to plan strategy and put more wins on the board, said Chase. Pooran, on the other hand, is among the leading white ball players with two half centuries in 19 T20I innings and also averaging close to 50 in ODIs. I see this as another opportunity to learn and grow in the game. I was vice captain for the tour of Sri Lanka earlier this year, so this is continuation of that work, said the 25 year old. It s always good to share your knowledge as we look to continue the winning mentality. We were successful in Sri Lanka and this is a series we believe we can get more success against New Zealand, he added. The three T20Is between New Zealand and the West Indies will be played on November 27, 29 and 30 while the two Tests will be played from December 3 and 11 respectively Keep scrolling to read more news Catch up on all the latest sports news and updates here. nbsp Also download the new mid day Android and iOS apps to get latest updates.

As of Wednesday, 52% of Italy's hospital beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients, above the 40% warning threshold set by the Health Ministry. Nine of Italy's 21 regions and autonomous provinces are already securely in the red- alert zone, above 50% virus occupancy, with Lombardy at 75%, Piedmont at 92% and South Tyrol at an astonishing 99%.
 Lombardy, Italy's most populous and productive region, is again the epicenter of Italy's pandemic, following resurgences in Spain, France and most of Europe that have also put hospitals under dire pressure.
 The region's hospitals are responding by reorganizing wards in a bid to avoid shutting down ordinary care, as happened spontaneously during Italy's first deadly coronavirus spike. Still, hospitals in Lombardy and neighboring Piedmont — designated red zones by the government last week — have closed surgical, pediatric and geriatric wards to make room for COVID patients. Veneto, still a lowest-tier yellow zone, is preparing to cancel all non-urgent procedures this week.

Usually a stickler for the clean-cut look, Chief Janik is allowing officers to grow facial hair in return for a $50 donation to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The fundraiser, organized by the Glenville Police Benevolent Association, is in honor of the Gilbert brothers. Their mom, Robin, says typical little boy activities like running around and playing sports can be too tiring, and it’s especially tough on 7-year-old Finlay.“He’s very sensitive and at the end of the day when everything falls apart and he’s so tired, then he has moments where he has cried about you know, it’s not really fair and he doesn’t know why he has this,” she said.“They are two adorable young men, with great big huge smiles on their face and it just makes us feel real good that we can help,” said Chief Janik.Last year, the PBA and the department raised nearly $7,000 for the same organization.

Well, I think what we’ve seen – I’ll – from what I’ve seen and maybe Alex or Mark may have a comment on this also. But we have seen a tremendous uptick in residential housing and purchasing of residential housing. And in the municipalities, depend very much on the building permit process for their fees. So as long as there’s a robust housing market, residential housing market, there’s more building permit fees and then there’s more fees to the municipality to manage their operation. Also including in that and maybe more down the road, is the increase in population, and therefore, the increase in sales tax, that the municipalities depends very much on for revenue. So the uptick that we’re seeing is coming from the increase in residential housing, and that has really been a positive impact in the municipalities that we did not foresee.

Diggs’ dream that we’re all going to come out of lockdown better than we were when it started seems to chime with the optimism that has since rippled out from the news of Joe Biden’s election victory and some promising vaccine trials. When it comes to telling stories, Diggs says once more that his hope for the future comes from thinking about the past. “Humans invented theatre because we need it,” he says. “We need to tell stories and to be entertained. If we get rid of all the bells and whistles, theatre will still exist. I remember early on [in lockdown] seeing all the videos popping up of people doing workout classes in the middle of their courtyards and everybody around watching. That’s theatre. That’s literally all it takes.”

LAHORE: An accountability court Wednesday indicted PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif his son, daughter and other family members in assets beyond means and money-laundering reference.
 The court after indictment of the accused has summoned prosecution witnesses on November 26. Jail authorities produced Shahbaz Sharif and Hamza Shahbaz before the court amid tight security as heavy contingent of law-enforcers had cordoned off the court premises. Shahbaz’s daughter Javeria Ali along with seven other nominated accused appeared before the court.
 As the hearing commenced, the judge Jawadul Hassan said he is going to frame charges against the accused. The judge while addressing the accused individually inquired that whether they accept the charges levelled against them by the NAB. Shahbaz and other accused refused to accept the charges and contended that they are innocent. The court after hearing the accused framed charges against them.
 The court has summoned prosecution witnesses including Punjab Assembly’s deputy secretary Faisal Bilal, Khalid Mehmood and Syed Tayyab Zawar on November 26 to start regular trial proceedings against Shahbaz family.
 Shahbaz in the court said still he has not been provided physiotherapist. He said he is opposition leader in the National Assembly and the NAB has made a fake case against him. He said the NAB has lost its credibility and is being used for ‘political engineering’. The NAB has failed to prove corruption of single penny against him in all the cases being probed against him including Ashiana, Ramzan Sugar Mills and 56 companies case, he added. “I have saved Rs81 billion of the nation in different projects and the NAB is accusing me of Rs7 billion,” he said. On a lighter note, he said the NAB after deducting Rs7 billion from Rs81 billion can return me the remaining amount. It is pertinent to mention that in this reference the proceedings to declare Shahbaz’s wife Nusrat Shahbaz, son Suleman Shahbaz, daughter Rabia Imran, Tahir Naqvi and Ali Ahmad as proclaimed offenders are in the process.
 In the reference against Shahbaz family, the NAB had claimed that in the last 30 years, the Shahbaz family assets ballooned from Rs 2 million to Rs7,000 million that the family failed to justify.
 The NAB alleged the accused Shahbaz Sharif in connivance with his co-accused family members, ‘Benamidars’, front men, close associates, employees and moneychangers developed an organised system of money-laundering for accumulation of assets disproportionate to his known sources of income to the tune of Rs 7,328 million. The NAB nominated former chief minister Shahbaz Sharif, his wife Nusrat Shahbaz, sons Hamza Shahbaz, Suleman Shahbaz, daughters Rabia Imran and Javeria Ali in the reference. Suleman Shahbaz is a proclaimed offender in this case.
 The other nominated accused include Nisar Ahmad, Syed Muhammad Tahir Naqvi, Ali Muhammad Khan, Qasim Qayyum, Rashid Karamat, Masroor Anwar, Muhammad Usman, Fazal Dad Abbasi, Muhammad Shoaib Qamar and Haroon Yousafzai.
 The NAB also accepted requests from four persons for becoming approvers against Shahbaz family in the reference including Muhammad Mushtaq alias Mushtaq Cheeni, his son Yasir Mushtaq, Shahid Rafique and Aftab Ahmad. It has been learnt that the reference consists of 25,000 pages and 55 volumes.
 In June 2019, Muhammad Mushtaq alias Cheeni and his son Yasir Mushtaq, front men for the Shahbaz family, while recording their statements before the court, confessed that they facilitated Suleman Shahbaz in whitening his Rs600 million black money through fake loan agreements and engineered telegraphic transfers (TTs).
 Meanwhile, PML-N Punjab spokesperson Azma Bukhari has said the government has taken no action against Jehangir Tareen, who stole Rs100 billion from the pockets of the masses.
 She said this while reacting to the indictment of PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shahbaz.
 Terming Shahbaz the architect of Punjab, she said he saved billions of dollars in development projects and his actions caused financial loss to his family business. “This is a political case made by this government,” she added.
 Talking about the stone pelting case outside the NAB office, she said the government has footage of Safe City Authority. It has already been reported that no worker of the PML-N threw stones outside the NAB office.
 She was talking to media outside the Judicial Complex along with Attaullah Tarar. PML-N Central Deputy Secretary General Attaullah Tarar said the police were trying to make arrests to disrupt the upcoming ‘Jalsa’ of the PDM in Lahore.
 “We are not afraid of these tactics and the Lahore Jalsa will show the government its true face,” he said, adding after the inquiry report on the Karachi incident, the question arises as to whether it was right to pick up the IG.
 The government used the NAB and other agencies to harass the political opponents, he said and maintained that let the nation know who was bothered by the slogan of “Madar-e-Millat Zindabad” at Mazar-e-Quaid.
 “We have rejected this inquiry report because it is not right for the institutions to provide their support to this incompetent government,” he added. “The case of Karachi incident has been dismissed. Shouldn’t a case be registered against those who lodged false and erroneous FIR?” he questioned.
 Federal ministers and treasury members in the National and provincial assemblies kept threatening to register cases, Azma Bukhari said, adding the actions taken against the PML-N by the government were reversed against them.
 “We have not yet decided to get pre-arrest bail of Maryam Nawaz,” she said, adding Musharraf was a better ruler than this government.
 Tarar said that a new NRO has been issued in this country. He said Imran Khan’s ‘ATM’ was brought back for his personal financing. He said the NAB became blind, dumb and deaf when it comes to Jehangir Tareen, Razzak Dawood and Nadeem Babar.
 “Imran Khan was right when he said that inflation in the country occurs when thieves are in government,” she said, adding in the past, the government was not a thief; therefore there was no inflation in the country.
 She said the PML-N appealed the chief justice to take a suo motu notice against Jehangir Tareen and bring the prices of sugar down. She said what more the government can do against the opposition, will they hang us?
 “The police are only targeting the opposition. We demand that Jehangir Tareen be arrested and asked how the sugar crisis came about, why he was given Rs560 million subsidy,” Tarar said, adding the government should panic now as their accountability will start soon.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — During a Pennsylvania court hearing this week on one of the many election lawsuits brought by President Donald Trump, a judge asked a campaign lawyer whether he had found any signs of fraud from among the 592 ballots challenged.The answer was no. “Accusing people of fraud is a pretty big step,” said the lawyer, Jonathan Goldstein. “We’re all just trying to get an election done.” Trump has not been so cautious, insisting without evidence that the election was stolen from him even when election officials nationwide from both parties say there has been no conspiracy. On Wednesday, Trump took aim at Philadelphia, the Democratic stronghold that helped push President-elect Joe Biden over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the race. The president accused a local Republican election official, Al Schmidt, of ignoring “a mountain of corruption &amp; dishonesty.” Twitter added a label that said the election fraud claim is disputed.Trump loyalists have filed at least 15 legal challenges in Pennsylvania alone in an effort to reclaim the state’s 20 electoral votes. There is action, too, in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan. In court, his lawyers must walk a precarious line between advocating for their client and upholding their professional oath.Legal ethicists and pro-democracy activists have questioned the participation of lawyers in this quest, as Trump clings to power and President-elect Joe Biden rolls out his agenda.“This may be an attempt to appease the ego in chief, but there are real world consequences for real people that come out of that,” said Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt, a former Justice Department elections official. “The attempt to soothe the president’s ego is not a victimless crime.” Schmidt told CBS' “60 Minutes” that his office has received death threats simply for counting votes.“From the inside looking out, it feels all very deranged,” Schmidt said in an interview that aired Sunday. “Counting votes cast on or before Election Day by eligible voters is not corruption. It is not cheating. It is democracy.”Untold voters, however, are accepting Trump’s claim about a rigged election and are donating to his legal fund.A law firm involved in the election suits, Ohio-based Porter Wright Morris &amp; Arthur, appeared to take down its Twitter feed Tuesday after it was inundated with attacks. The firm declined to address questions from The Associated Press about the feed in a statement issued Wednesday that said it had a long history of election work.A second firm, Jones Day, said it was representing not the Trump campaign but the Pennsylvania GOP, in litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court over the three-day extension to accept mail-in ballots. Nationally, the strategy is being run by Trump allies such as Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney; political operative David Bossie, who is not an attorney; and Jay Sekulow, a lead lawyer during the president’s impeachment trial this year. Bossie recently tested positive for COVID-19.Election law expert Rick Hasen said he would expect to see top- drawer Supreme Court litigators involved, such as two former solicitors general, Paul Clement or Theodore Olson, if Trump had a strong case.“There are certain names of elite lawyers that signal to the Supreme Court that something is serious,” said Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. Instead, “the campaign announced that it was putting Rudy Giuliani and David Bossie in charge.” The low point of the effort undoubtedly came Saturday, when Giuliani held a news conference outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia just after the race was called for Biden. Standing in the shadow of a sex shop and a crematorium, just down the road from a state prison, Giuliani called a disgruntled poll watcher to the microphone to discuss the “shenanigans” in the city. Political observers tuning in from nearby Trenton, New Jersey, immediately recognized the man as a convicted sex offender and perennial candidate for office.In another head-scratching moment, as the campaign tried to stop the vote count in Philadelphia last week, a judge tried to get to the bottom of a Republican complaint over observer access in the room where election workers were processing mail-in ballots.“I am asking you as a member of the bar of this court, are people representing the Donald J. Trump for president (campaign) … in that room?” U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond asked. “There’s a nonzero number of people in the room,” campaign lawyer Jerome Marcus replied. Diamond made the two sides forge an agreement and threatened to charge them with contempt if they didn’t keep the peace. Some of the suits filed on Trump’s behalf appear to be hastily thrown together, with spelling errors (“ballet” for “ballot”), procedural mistakes and little to back up their claims. Judges have been skeptical. In Michigan, Judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed one filing as “inadmissible hearsay within hearsay.” When Trump’s lawyers appealed, the next court kicked the filing back as “defective.” The campaign has scored just one small victory, allowing their observers to stand a little closer to election workers processing the mail-in ballots in Philadelphia. But the litigation keeps coming, usually centered on accusations from partisan poll watchers, who have no auditing role in the election, that something untoward may have happened, without evidence to back it up. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., insists the president is “100% within his rights” to look into fraud allegations and pursue his legal options. Attorney General William Barr has authorized the Justice Department to investigate “clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities.”Either way, experts doubt the suits can reverse the outcome in a single state, let alone the election. Trump aides and allies have privately admitted as much, suggesting the challenges are designed more to stoke his base.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

However, Johnson's government has operated an unusually centralized approach to governing, which has irked many former allies during the coronavirus crisis. This has meant that Cummings, in the eyes of Conservative lawmakers, has won his battles more often than not.
 Meanwhile, the UK economy is struggling to recover from the effects of restrictions imposed to curb the pandemic. Amid a soaring second wave of coronavirus cases, England entered a second, month-long national lockdown on November 5. Strict measures have also been imposed in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in recent weeks.
 The Bank of England last week warned of a double-dip recession because of the pandemic and an uncertain outlook because of Brexit. The central bank expects the economy to shrink by 2% in the fourth quarter, and by 11% in 2020.
 The appointment of Stratton and perceived sidelining of Cain would count as one of the most significant internal battles that Cummings would have lost since entering Downing Street last year.
 Conservative MPs have been alarmed at Johnson's loyalty to Cummings, despite various scandals surrounding the adviser, the most famous of which came when Cummings drove hundreds of miles from London with his wife and child after having Covid-19 symptoms while the country was in a national lockdown.
 Despite the furor, Cummings did not resign and was not sacked. His activities were investigated by the police, but he faced no action. Johnson stood by Cummings despite the impact of the scandal on public trust.
 "Advisers usually take the bullet for the PM, not the other way around. Boris nearly killed his career defending Cummings during lockdown," said a senior Conservative MP. "Boris does not seem to realize how much damage Cummings is doing him."
 The Cain row appears to have given hope to those who would like Johnson to stop listening to Cummings quite so often in all areas of policy, which of course has implications beyond the UK's pandemic response.
 Cain was a key part of the Vote Leave team which followed Johnson into Downing Street, having successfully campaigned for UK voters to reject EU membership in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Johnson's willingness to shed such an ally has led to some No 10 staff wondering if this indicates a broader loosening of the Vote Leave grip on Johnson.
 "I think something bigger is going on with the EU deal," said one Downing Street insider, referencing the ongoing Brexit negotiations which are approaching their end. The insider suggested a concession from London might be on the cards.
 The UK government is still locked in talks with Brussels with less than two months before the scheduled conclusion of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020.
 As things stand on Brexit, a concession from London would be the simplest route to a breakthrough that would lead to a deal.
 Either way, the political focus in London has shifted in just a few days from the implications of a Joe Biden presidency and what that might mean for Johnson to the inner court of Johnson and what it all means for Brexit. Which, the British public might reasonably ask, might not be entirely appropriate during a pandemic.

Bringing cheers to Indian mobile gamers ahead of Diwali, PUBG Corporation on Thursday said it is making a comeback to the India market with the creation of an Indian subsidiary and a new game. With its South Korean parent company Krafton, Inc., PUBG Corp also plans to make investments worth 100 million in India to cultivate the local video game, esports, entertainment, and IT industries, the company said. The immensely popular PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds PUBG Mobile app was among the 118 Chinese apps that the Indian government banned in September over national security concerns. To get the ban lifted, PUBG Corp made the decision to no longer authorise the PUBG Mobile franchise to China based Tencent Games in India. Confirming this on Thursday, PUBG said it is preparing to launch PUBG Mobile India, a new game created specifically for the Indian market. The Indian subsidiary will hire over 100 employees specialising in business, esports, and game development, PUBG Corp said. In addition to establishing a local office, the company will look to actively collaborate and leverage local businesses to strengthen its gaming service, it added. The company also revealed plans to provide a secure and healthy gameplay environment alongside investments to cultivate local video game, esports, entertainment, and IT industries. To assuage privacy and data security concerns, PUBG said it will conduct regular audits and verifications on the storage systems holding Indian users personally identifiable information to reinforce security and ensure that their data is safely managed. To build and foster a healthy gameplay environment, in game content will be improved and tailored to reflect local needs, it added. Various aspects of the game will be customized for Indian gamers, such as the game now being set in a virtual simulation training ground, new characters automatically starting clothed, and green hit effects to reflect the virtual nature of the game. The company will include a feature that places restrictions on game time to promote healthy gameplay habits for younger players. The company, however, did not disclose the launch date of PUBG Mobile India. nbsp Keep scrolling to read more news Catch up on all the latest Crime, National, International and Hatke news here.

The dynamic leaves Biden with little choice but to try to govern from the vanishing middle of a Washington that's been badly ruptured by the tumult of the last decade.

As nascent peace talks between Afghan government representatives and leaders of the Afghan Taliban, facilitated by Pakistan, struggle to get off the ground in Doha, analysts and officials say the fate of those talks will, in large part, determine Biden’s approach to Pakistan. “The main goal is reconciliation in Afghanistan and that effort continues,” said a Pakistani national security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to media. “What we don’t want to see happening is the Afghan government and Taliban talks failing, and Pakistan being blamed for that, for not having ‘done enough’.” The US also remains Pakistan’s largest bilateral export market, with economic ties between the two countries amounting to $6.16bn in the last financial year, according to Pakistani central bank data. Of that, $3.9bn was in Pakistani exports.
 The US has also provided the South Asian country – home to more than 220 million people and eastern neighbour to Afghanistan, where the US has fought a 19-year war against the Afghan Taliban – with a lot of civilian and security aid. Last year, the US pledged $684m in assistance to Pakistan, of which $369m was in the form of military aid, according to US government data. The relationship, analysts say, has been on its surest footing in years since 2018, when the US government under President Donald Trump committed to reaching a negotiated peace settlement with the Afghan Taliban, and between the Taliban and the Afghan government. Just months earlier, however, the relationship appeared to have reached its lowest ebb in decades. Hardline approach towards Islamabad In August 2017, in his first policy statement on South Asia since becoming president, Trump excoriated Pakistan with a common US criticism, accusing the country of providing safe havens to the Afghan Taliban’s leadership while also acting as a US strategic ally. The statement set alarm bells ringing in Islamabad, and it was no surprise when in January 2018, Trump once again went after the country in typically blunt fashion, this time on Twitter. “The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools,” he said.
 That tweet prompted the cutting of more than $1.1bn in US security assistance to the country’s powerful military, which has directly ruled Pakistan for roughly half of its 73-year history. “Trump’s messaging back then was tough and unforgiving – and it was music to the ears of Pakistan hawks in Washington, who had long thought that US policy needed to take a more hardline approach toward Islamabad,” says Michael Kugelman, deputy director at the Washington, DC-based Wilson Center think-tank. In Pakistan, the message was received loud and clear, say analysts. “There was a sense that the relationship was heading towards being more transactional, [and] the consensus in Pakistan was that a complete rupture was cost-prohibitive,” says Fahd Humayun, a security analyst.
 Intra-Afghan talks
 Pakistani officials have privately voiced concern that any breakdown of talks, a further increase in violence, or Biden’s likely approach of focusing in his first six months on domestic crises such as the coronavirus, could also increase pressure on Pakistan. “If the US is distracted by internal issues, what does that mean for the Afghan government and Taliban negotiations?” said the Pakistani national security official. “This means that the regional countries may have to take a more pronounced role in facilitating intra-Afghan talks.” The official said Pakistan did not want to be blamed for any failure in talks. “Pakistan wants to see success in intra-Afghan negotiations according to the wishes of Afghan people. We’ve done all we can to facilitate the Afghan government and the US because we want to see peace and stability in the region. It is in Pakistan’s interest,” he said. Itself emerging from years of battling the Pakistani Taliban, the South Asian country has seen violence drop sharply after a series of military operations to rout the armed group from Pakistani soil. Now, the country has been seeking to revamp its image in the world as a more secure country, and it has received some support from the US in this regard, says Afzal.
 “Pakistan helped the US in the Afghan peace process; Trump remained scrupulously positive in his public statements on Afghanistan, which was helpful as Pakistan sought to revamp its image,” she says. Another major bone of contention on the road to Pakistan’s redemption in the court of international public opinion has been its battles with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which in 2018 placed the country on its “grey list” for not taking stringent enough action against money laundering and terrorism financing. Last month, FATF gave the country until February to complete progress on its action plan, while certifying that the country had now largely addressed 21 out of 27 action items. “We do expect that all of our work at the FATF should be supported and recognised and this sword that hangs over us should be removed,” said the Pakistani national security official. ‘More comprehensive relationship’ With US-Pakistan relations tentatively improving, the big question is whether Biden will change anything and alter that trajectory. Most analysts believe he will stay the course set by Trump in the region, with minor adjustments. “The top line is that we shouldn’t expect much to change,” says Afzal at the Brookings Institution. “America still wants to leave Afghanistan. But Biden will do this more responsibly. He will not let the Taliban get away with as much as Trump did, and will hold it accountable for violating elements of the peace deal such as not cutting ties with al- Qaeda. Biden, who has years of experience on the powerful US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he followed the regional situation closely, could return the two countries to a more comprehensive relationship, said Humayun, the security analyst. “The Biden administration would bring a lot more nuance to its understanding of Pakistan,” he says. “It is expected to rehabilitate the role of policy area specialists, which was almost completely ended under Trump.” Humayun warns, however, that such a structural approach, not dependent on personalities, would also reduce the potential for “big wins” in the relationship. “That also means there is less scope for the kind of unpredictability that could lead to massive improvements like what we saw when [Pakistani PM] Imran Khan visited the US and Trump made comments on Kashmir,” he says.

Britain’s official coronavirus death toll passed the grim milestone of 50,000 today after health chiefs announced another 595 victims in the highest daily count since May.
 Boris Johnson said the figures was a stark reminder that the UK 'was not out of the woods yet' despite promising news about a vaccine earlier this week. Officials say Covid fatalities will continue to rise for 'several weeks' due to high infection rates though October.
 But despite the gloomy warnings of thousands more deaths, the silver lining is that daily cases are down week on week. A total of 22,950 new infections were recorded today — which is 8.8 per cent lower than the 25,177 that were registered last Wednesday.
 The figures come after a catalogue of data has suggested that lockdown may have been a rash move and that the country's outbreak appeared to be slowing down already thanks to the three-tier local lockdown system imposed in mid- October.
 Department of Health figures show the UK's official death toll now stands at 50,365, with today's figure the highest recorded in a single day since May 12 - when there were 614 fatalities.
 It comes after the Prime Minister today warned that a vaccine will not deliver a 'knockout blow' to coronavirus as Tories insisted he must not use the prospect of jabs to keep the country in lockdown longer.
 At a bad-tempered PMQs session, Mr Johnson welcomed the news Pfizer's vaccine had been 90 per cent effective in early trials. But he gave a stern message to the public that they should not expect an early end to the blanket restrictions, despite claims it could start being rolled out by Christmas.

Well, things certainly seem to be better for us. We had originally budgeted a significant reduction in our revenue, but that hadn’t transpired. But one thing is a good – what we’ve always used as a rule of thumb or source of reference. We worry or we are concerned if our backlog drops too much below 65% of anticipated revenue. So I’m saying $572 million, and that would probably give us a solid backlog entering into the fourth quarter and to the new year. And we are very, very conservative in that backlog because we use it for budget for purposes. And we only recognize in backlog actual revenue that we’re going to build in a rolling 12-month period. As far as some delays, maybe actually let Alex maybe can comment on – I will comment on if there’s any large projects that we had seen pushed that because of various things. And of course, we’re all waiting for this relief package that an infrastructure bill. But Alex and then maybe Mark can comment from what he sees in the Geospatial area.

Actually, a pretty well executed task.   The carnival games roadblock definitely had a Moulin Rouge feel to it.

 While the Portuguese is believed to be on at least 5-times the wage that his nearest team-mate Paulo Dybala receives, his presence in Turin is worth much more than that.
 The DailyMail states that he is on a whopping £28 Million contract, but also states that the hierarchy at Juventus rate his worth to the club as much more than that both on and off the pitch.
 Chairman Andrea Agnelli has been using the iconic superstar to maximise his dealings with sponsors in recent years, as well as using him as an attraction in the transfer market.
 The 35 year-old is also showing little signs of slowing down on the pitch despite his age, having scored six goals in his four Serie A outings this term.
 This is before you take into account that the forward has sold 1 Million Juventus shirts with his name included on the design, further enhancing the profile of both the club and the player.
 Cristiano appears to be relishing the new season with the Old Lady, and looks primed to enjoy another astonishing season in front of goal, and the report adds that the player will be honouring his current contract at the minimum, while an extension could be possible if the player is open to staying in Italy beyond 2022.
 While the transfer rumours are part and parcel with the game, the latest reports appear to have been unfounded, and the club would be crazy to consider his exit.
 Could we persuade Cristiano to stay on at the Allianz beyond 2022?

After results from the hand recount are certified, the losing campaign can then request another recount, which will be performed by machine, Raffensperger said.
 There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden’s lead stood at 0.28 percentage points as of Wednesday morning.

The ongoing pandemic has made the release slate unpredictable and paralysed the global film industry, with distributors postponing tentpole movies like the eternally delayed _No Time To Die_ , _Black Widow_ , _Soul_ , _Candyman_ and _Dune_ , to name but a few who have opted to skip 2020 altogether. What have we been left with? Netflix cackhandedly decided to re-edit _Back To The Future Part II_ for no apparent reason other than sheer boredom, Disney pulled the Mushu-free _Mulan_ release and not only dumped it on their streaming platform but had the unabashed gall to make subscribers pay an extra fee to watch what turned out to be an uninspiring missed opportunity, and there’s the never-ending turd-polishing _Justice League_ chat that continues to beg the question: Who gives a vomiting Pazuzu what the Snyder Cut looks like?

What about the all-important book value of the company?
 Back in Q2 2020, we saw book value rise nicely. Given the positive action in the quarter, we easily suspected an increase in book value. Book value rose 3%, adding to big gains from Q2 relative to Q1. Here, in Q3, book value came in at $13.17. The most interesting part of all of this is that over the last few quarters, we have seen shares move from trading at over a 30% discount-to- book, to a much lower discount. Here at $11.77, we are at a $1.40 or a 10.6% discount. In this volatile market, let the stock fall to a 20% discount again before buying. That is our advice.
 We continue to believe that the smaller overall size of the company and its holdings is an advantage in this market environment. The stock has already made a big move since we last covered it, but we are pleased to say it is back in business. Should the stock get crushed by a market selloff in the coming days or weeks, we suggest that you consider shares at a 20% discount to the last known book value.
