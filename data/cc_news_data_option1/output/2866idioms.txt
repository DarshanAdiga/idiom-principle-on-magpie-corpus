Xbox Live Gold on Xbox One will soon be free, according to a new rumor. Recently, Microsoft ended Xbox Live Gold's yearly subscription option. And at the moment of publishing, it hasn't provided any explanation for why it has done this, suggesting there's something afoot involving Xbox Live Gold. On the back of this, prominent Xbox insider Klobrille has teased that it's not a matter of if, but when the paywall for Xbox Live Gold comes down.
 Unfortunately, this is all the insider divulges. However, there's a chance we will hear more about this at Xbox's upcoming event this Thursday, though Microsoft did say last week the event would focus only on Xbox Series X and Xbox One games.
 If the current paywall for Xbox Live Gold -- $60 for a year's worth of subscription -- comes down, it will be interesting to see if Microsoft attempts to subsidize this considerable revenue loss by driving Xbox users to its other products, such as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
 Right now, Microsoft offers both Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The two offers are largely identical in every regard beyond the fact that the latter comes bundled with Xbox Live Gold. For this -- and a few other smaller features -- Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers pay an extra $5 a month compared to vanilla Xbox Game Pass subscribers.
 If the paywall of Xbox Live Gold comes down that also effectively removes the only difference between Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Ultimate. In other words, if Microsoft makes Xbox Live Gold free, it would have to provide Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers with something else to justify the increased price. Unless of course, Microsoft is planning to bury Xbox Live Gold behind Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but I can't imagine this happening. Forcing your average Xbox user to pay an extra $10 a month and subscribe to Xbox Game Pass just to utilize Xbox Live Gold would not go down well.
 3comments
 That said, for now, everything here should be taken with a grain of salt. Nothing here is official. And at the moment, Microsoft has not commented on the claim, which has been floated around by a few other sources as well.

City Manager Dave Callister explained that the purchase agreement is in the general vicinity of $25 million, though it could be higher or lower than that.
 Ehlers, the city’s financial advisors, provided an analysis of costs associated with the acquisition, renovation and operations if it were to be operated as a municipal golf course, which ranges from $30-40 million (see tax impact graph for residential and commercial).
 An in-depth analysis of the operations of Hollydale as a municipally run golf course has not been done, though the assumption in the analysis is that the course could break even (including depreciation) and would not affect the general fund. If the city decides to pursue acquisition of the property, a more detailed operations analysis could be completed at that time.
 If the city council were to approve a fall referendum, a more definitive purchase price would need to be determined before the question could be placed on the ballot. The deadline for a question to be added to the ballot for the fall election is August 21.
 Resident Jeff Cook told the council that if a referendum is held on Hollydale then there should be one on Plymouth Creek Center expansion as well.
 Councilmember Jim Willis explained that the Plymouth Creek Center is already a city-owned community center and the expansion of it has been in the comprehensive plan, whereas the city owning and operating a golf course has not.
 Willis said he would like to see the city purchase the property but only if there is enough interest to do so and supported a referendum since the potential purchase of the property would increase taxes.
 Councilmember Jim Prom said he did not support the city purchasing a golf course and listed projects of higher priority that will also lead to increased taxes, including the expansion and upgrades to two fire stations and County Road 47.
 A graph of the city’s proposed debt levy shows a change from 8% ($2 million) in 2021, which includes the first year of the Plymouth Creek Center, to 13.4% ($6.6 million) in 2022, which includes the two fire stations and Hollydale (estimated purchase price of $40 million). A projected 9% increase would occur in 2023 with the proposed upgrades to County Road 47.
 Councilmember Jim Davis asked if the issue could be tabled until there is discussion regarding land use. But the city’s attorney said a discussion on land use can not happen until there is a rezoning application submitted by the developer.
 The council agreed to table discussion to the next meeting, Tuesday, July 28, in order to consider comments from the public and determine a purchase price for a ballot question.

  Olubukola Nafiu, the lead author of the study and a pediatric anesthesiologist at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, said the authors were not surprised to find that healthy children, across the board, had extremely low rates of mortality and rates of complications after surgery. But what surprised them was the magnitude of the difference in mortality and complication rates by race.

Voters in Michigan’s 14th Congressional District will choose between two Republicans seeking their party’s nomination to compete for a U.S. House seat traditionally held by Democrats.
 The 14th Congressional District contains portions of Wayne and Oakland counties, including a portion of Detroit. It is among the most Democratic- voting districts in Michigan and currently represented by U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Southfield, who is seeking reelection to a fourth term.
 Voters will choose between civil defense attorney Daryle Houston II and self- employed contractor Robert Vance Patrick in the GOP primary on Aug. 4. The winner will go on to face either Lawrence or Terrance Morrison, a retired Detroit city employee challenging her in the Democratic primary.
 Lawrence served as the mayor of Southfield for 13 years before joining the U.S. House in 2014. She was re-elected to a third term in 2018 and did not face a Democratic primary challenger that year.
 Vance appears to have a sizable fundraising advantage in the Republican primary. He raised $20,159 throughout the campaign cycle and had $12,020 left to spend on the race at the end of June, according to the most recent financial statements available.
 Houston did not file any financial statements with the Federal Election Commission.
 Lawrence had $860,962 left to spend on her reelection campaign at the end of June. Morrison did not file quarterly statements in 2020 but had raised $1,000 by the end of 2019.
 Voters in the 14th Congressional District can cast a ballot in either the Republican primary or Democratic primary, but not both.
 This year, MLive Media Group partnered with the League of Women Voters of Michigan to provide candidate information for readers. Each candidate was asked to outline their stances on a variety of public policy issues.
 Information on all state and federal races and many of Michigan’s county and local races will be available at Vote411.org, an online voter guide created by the League of Women Voters.

ORLANDO, Fla. - Suzie Wells was reluctant to leave her husband in Boca Raton after he was released from the hospital following a severe asthma attack. With her mother suffering kidney failure in London, her husband assured her that she should be with her mother for her last days.
   
 After a week in London, which concluded with her mother's funeral, Wells bought a ticket to Miami only to be turned away by an immigration officer at Heathrow airport who denied her boarding on the basis of President Donald Trump's travel ban.
   
 Wells is a British citizen and lives in Florida on an E2 visa, which grants non-U.S. citizens and their families temporary residence status in exchange for running a business. Such visa holders are supposed to be allowed to leave and return to the U.S. without problems.
   
 Jack Nicklaus reveals he and wife, Barbara, tested positive for COVID-19 in March
   
 But when Trump issued a travel ban to stem the spread of coronavirus, those new restrictions didn't account for E2 visa holders who were outside the U.S. One legal expert estimated as many as 1,000 people were left suddenly stranded overseas - separated from their families and the businesses the U.S. government was encouraging them to operate.
   
 The problems illustrate how a global pandemic can unexpectedly complicate international transit and the economy, stranding helpless travelers far from home and at the mercy of governments overwhelmed and distracted by the health crisis.
   
 For more than three months, Wells sought desperately to get back home to her husband, whose doctor said he should not be living alone with his asthmatic condition. Her husband is also an E2 visa holder, working at an English publishing company.
   
 What went wrong in Florida? Timing, testing, tourism and a COVID-19 crush?
   
 The State Department said any foreign national with an urgent need to travel is encouraged to contact their nearest embassy or consulate if the situation is an emergency. For Wells, her initial emergency request was denied, despite letters from her husband's doctor. But the department later made it possible for Wells to return home on June 16.
   
 Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration lawyer, estimated at least 1,000 people could be experiencing similar problems, based on State Department figures showing that it issued 63,178 such visas last year.
   
 "Frankly, (the government) doesn't care because they're more interested in stopping legal immigrants from coming in than they are about the economic consequences of doing so," Kuck said.
   
 Another E2 visa holder, Kevin Jowett, has been stuck in the U.K. since March 14, after his appointment to renew his visa was canceled on two separate occasions.
   
 He applied for an expedited visa twice, and the offices of Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Ross Spano contacted the embassy on his behalf. All were told that the embassy was not making appointments.
   
 His wife, Audrey, remains alone in Clermont managing their business.
   
 The Jowetts own Revolution Off Road, an adventure park west of Orlando that employed 13 Americans, but four lost their jobs during the coronavirus shutdown. Jowett said his former employees could make more money from unemployment benefits than they could working part time since the business only operates three days a week while he is away.
   
 Jowett said he risks losing a contract to open a second park location, where he hopes to employ three or four more people.
   
 Jowett is frustrated after living in Florida for 13 years now. He considers the U.S. his home, but said he feels ignored and neglected by the U.S. government, even though he pays taxes, creates jobs for Americans and contributes to the U.S. economy.
   
 While Jowett has been away, his wife fell ill and now needs neurosurgery. He has applied for two more exceptions to return to his wife, but the embassy denied both.
   
 He applied under an exception announced last week that allows certain business travelers, investors, treaty traders, academics and students from the Schengen Area, United Kingdom, and Ireland into the U.S. if they qualify. He is still waiting.
   
 "You do everything legally. You do everything by the book, and you get penalized for it," Jowett said in a phone interview.
   
 Another UK citizen, Jeff Temperley, and his daughter have been unable to return to Panama City Beach since January. Complications with the visa renewal process left them trapped outside the U.S. by the travel ban.
   
 He said he feels like he lives a nomadic existence in which he does not belong in the country where he was born or the county he now calls his home.
   
 "We aren't here because we're lazy; we're here because we're useful," Temperley said. "We put so much at risk and get so little help in return."
   
 Temperley owns a restaurant and a food truck, but his family was forced to sell their businesses and is preparing to move back to the UK. He said no dream was worth his family being separated.
   
 Jowett and Wells said they were outraged to learn that English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick was granted a visa at the end of May to compete in the PGA golf tournament in June.
   
 "I'm not a sportsman who might come to the U.S., win a few million and take it out of the country," Jowett said. "I'm contributing to the U.S. economy, and I can't even get an interview. It's disappointing."
   
 Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in London remains effectively closed despite the government there easing lockdown restrictions throughout the country.

Bennett’s success and style of play would fairly lead one to believe that he was a superstar at the NFL Combine, but that wasn’t the case. Bennett ran a pedestrian five second 40-yard dash at 274 pounds and hit 31 inches in the vertical jump. Nothing special.
 What was special was his level of skill and craft he brought to defensive line play and a trait the Combine doesn’t measure well: balance. Players that size aren’t supposed to be able to bowl over and evade offensive guards with ease while finishing plays in the backfield.
 132 career tackles for loss is nothing to sneeze at. Achieving that number as an average athlete, comparatively of course, makes his career even more special. Even as a 33-year-old player for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018, Bennett was able to tie a career high for quarterback hits with 30 — good for fourth in the NFL that season.
 His game was timeless.

Federal safety regulators are moving closer to letting the grounded Boeing 737 Max fly again with changes that Boeing made to the plane after two deadly crashes.
 The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday that “in the near future” it will issue a proposed safety directive for the plane. The agency gave no indication, however, of when it might lift its March 2019 order that grounded the plane.
 The FAA said it would allow 45 days for public comment on Boeing’s proposed changes to the plane and pilot-training procedures to address problems found during investigations of the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which together killed 346 people.
 Investigators have focused on a flight-control system, new to the Max, that pushed the nose of both planes down based on faulty readings from sensors. Boeing has been working to fix the system and make other changes since shortly after the first crash, in October 2018.
 The FAA said posting the proposed airworthiness directive is an “important milestone,” but a “number of key steps remain” before passengers are allowed back on Max jets. The agency will publish a final safety directive. Separately, regulators from the U.S., Canada, Europe and Brazil will review proposed minimum pilot-training requirements. Boeing and the FAA recently flew a series of test flights.
 “The FAA will not speculate when the work will be completed,” the agency said in a statement. “We will lift the grounding order only after FAA safety experts are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.”
 Congressional committees are looking into FAA’s certification of the Max. Lawmakers have faulted the FAA’s oversight of Boeing and proposed changes in FAA's reliance on employees of aircraft makers to analyze the safety of their own planes.
 Nearly 400 Max jets were in service around the world when they were grounded, and since then Boeing has built several hundred more that have stacked up at company facilities.

"Walking in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song;


   


  Put a smile upon your face as if there;s nothing wrong...


   


  Think about a good time had a long time ago;


   


  Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes...


   


  "Walking in the Sunshine," as performed by Roger Miller


   


  In an interview conducted a few years ago with Stan Druckenmiller, Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone asked the famous hedge fund investor what his biggest mistake had been. Druckenmiller didn't need much time to ponder his answer.


   


  In February of 1999, in the middle of the tech boom, when dotcom stocks only seemed to go up, Druckenmiller made the decision to use $200 million to short internet stocks. Druckenmiller rightfully sensed that the tech boom was a bubble and wanted to bet on it popping.


   


  But a little over a month later tech stocks were still climbing precipitously. Druckenmiller found himself down by $600 million, decided that he had been wrong and reversed field, buying tech stocks instead of shorting them.


   


  At year's end, his fund was up 35%, and in January he sold all his tech stocks. Had he stopped there he would have been fine. But dotcom stocks kept climbing. In March of 2000, Druckenmiller, against his better judgment, bought $6 billion worth of tech stocks. Within weeks the bubble burst and his fund lost $3 billion on that bet.


   


  When Langone asked him what he learned from his mistake, he replied, "I didn't learn anything. I already knew that I wasn't supposed to do that. I was just an emotional basket case and I couldn't help myself."


   


  The irony is that Druckenmiller knew he was making a mistake when he pulled the trigger buying into a bubble, but he just couldn't stop himself. Call it FOMO…Fear of Missing Out. Even the smartest investor can lose money by failing to heed their better judgment and letting emotion rule their investment decisions.


   


  Piling into a hot sector or stock with all of your chips is a well-known temptation, even for seasoned investors with years of experience. I often find myself saying that managing money during bubbles appears easy but is actually more difficult than managing money during busts.


   


  It's easy to lose your investment discipline when prices only seem to go up. Bear markets automatically impose discipline.


   


  Both of my sons work for my firm. While neither managed money during the dotcom bubble, I have attempted to institutionalize the memory of what it feels like to participate in markets during a bubble. It must have sunk in. My younger son, who writes a weekly blog called Beach Reading (available on our website), recently referenced dotcom bubble valuations and how many of today's tech darlings are as aspirationally priced as their dotcom equivalents were.


   


  Allowing emotion to run wild is usually not a good formula for success. Most folks need to be careful investing their nest egg; the markets are not a roulette wheel or dice game. Success requires careful and calm decision making.

Max Unger the center now looks more like Max Unger the tight end.
   
 But the former Saints Pro Bowler who retired last season isn't quite sure if he could make that position switch.
   
 "I don't know man, I think I might be too light for tight end," Unger said jokingly on a teleconference on Monday.
   
 Unger says he is "240ish" now, shedding about 60 pounds from the 305 he carried during his four seasons with the Saints. It's all been part of his transition from one of the best centers in the NFL to life after football.
   
 "Weight loss was the first priority," Unger said. "It was a good thing to focus on right out of the gate. It's another thing to obsess over. It's kind of an easy transition."
   
 For Unger, the past 15 months have been his first time not playing football since he was in the eighth grade. He announced his retirement last March, stuck around New Orleans for Mardi Gras and then made his way back home to Hawaii.
   
 There, he's been enjoying retirement and helping his dad on the ranch.
   
 "Other than that, just kinda recovering," Unger said. "It's been an interesting break from football. Playing football full time for the better part of 20 years, so the first fall without playing football was interesting, as I think it is for most guys who have been playing football in the NFL for a while."
   
 Unger's retirement was supposed to be a major blow to the Saints. It was supposed to be hard to replace a guy who was first team All Pro in 2012 when he was with the Seattle Seahawks. Unger also has three Pro Bowls on his resume, including one with the Saints in 2018 in his third season after being acquired in the Jimmy Graham trade. The loss of Unger was the biggest question mark for the Saints heading into training camp this time a year ago. The race to replace him was a crowded one with second round draft pick Erik McCoy, free agent signee Nick Easton and a couple players already on the roster (Will Clapp and Cameron Tom). The battle was settled quickly and McCoy won the job and in the process, impressed the guy whose giant shoes he had to fill.
   
 "The guy came in and played his butt off," Unger said."... It was impressive. He started every game at center and that's hard to do in this offense, especially with Drew coming into the huddle calling plays at 100 miles an hour."
   
 While the Saints didn't skip a beat at center, Unger admits it was tough watching his former team play the game he loves without him.
   
 "Right after you play, you're so familiar with what's going on with the team and the plays being called, so it's really hard to watch the games honestly," Unger said. "You kinda know what's going on. You're so invested in the players and how they are doing. When you don't know what's going on and you don't have any influence on the outcome of the game, it's tough. I wasn't expecting that."
   
 But Unger knows leaving the game when he did was the perfect time to do so. And even if he had stuck around one more season, he's pretty sure the COVID-19 pandemic that the league is now trying to deal with would have made him hang up the cleats for good.
   
 "If I wasn't already retired, I don't think I would have been able to do this honestly," Unger said.
   
 For him, the offseason workouts and conditioning at the practice facility with his teammates is something he felt would have been critical for him to keep going.
   
 Not that he wanted to.
   
 Unger, who turned 34 in April, knew it was time last year.
   
 "You start playing offensive line in the NFL past the age of 30, its going to be tough," Unger said. "Towards the end of my career, it was time to call it quits. It felt like my body was almost to the end of being able to do it. It was time. I'm feeling better."
   
 And he has the weight loss to prove it.
   
 "So far, no regrets," Unger said.

It also points to a report from Ben Nimmo, in 2017, which found pro-Russian internet trolls had also been spreading claims the poll had been rigged and pushing for the ballot to be repeated.
 And the ISC notes another committee of MPs, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, in February last year, urged the government to launch an independent investigation into, among other things, foreign interference in the Scottish vote.
 On the report's wider criticism that defending the UK's democratic processes appears to have been treated as "a hot potato", with no one organisation taking the lead, the government has pointed to its Defending Democracy programme, set up in 2019.
 And it says the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - which is part of the programme - responded to several incidents during the 2019 general election, including cyber-attacks against political parties.
 ## Who are the unnamed individuals?
 The report talks about Russian money being used to build influence "across a wide sphere of the British establishment".
 "PR firms, charities, political interests, academia and cultural institutions were all willing beneficiaries of Russian money," it says.
 And this created a "new normal", whereby Russians very close to President Vladimir Putin are well integrated into the UK business and social scene.
 But the report doesn't name names, neither Russian individuals nor British beneficiaries.
 "Russian intelligence services will analyse whatever we put in the public domain," it says.
 And this would have "the potential to damage the capabilities of the intelligence and security agencies and defence intelligence."
 But the report does highlight a number of members of the House of Lords who have business interests linked to Russia or work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state.
 Again, they're not named but the report says these links should be "carefully scrutinised, given the potential for the Russian state to exploit them".

Doctors at the Queens Hospital Center, a public hospital in Jamaica, and at other medical centers wanted to transfer patients to Billie Jean King. But they were blocked by bureaucracy, turf battles and communication failures, according to internal documents and interviews with workers.
 New York paid as much as $732 an hour for some doctors at Billie Jean King, but the city made them spend hours on paperwork. They were supposed to treat coronavirus patients, but they did not accept people with fevers, a hallmark symptom of the virus. Officials said the site would serve critically ill patients, but workers said it opened with only one or two ventilators.
 “I basically got paid $2,000 a day to sit on my phone and look at Facebook,” said Katie Capano, a nurse practitioner from Baltimore who worked at Billie Jean King. “We all felt guilty. I felt really ashamed, to be honest.”
 As the coronavirus spread in March, the federal government, state leaders, city officials and hospital executives all began creating their own temporary medical facilities, at times competing against each other. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office oversaw most transfers to the centers, but city officials say the state did not closely coordinate with other players.
 The federal government’s biggest contribution, Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort, arrived in New York with great fanfare but initially did not accept coronavirus patients at all, prompting one hospital executive to call it “a joke.”
 Even once the Comfort began treating people with COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, the hospital ship and another overflow facility run by the state, located at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, mostly accepted patients transferred from private medical centers, not from the public hospitals that were the most besieged, according to government data.
 Billie Jean King, the only emergency hospital built by the city, should have been a success story: It opened at the height of the pandemic, with a full staff eager to treat virus patients.
 An aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio who helped oversee the site, Jackie Bray, said the city acted quickly to open it but ultimately concluded patients were best treated at existing hospitals, even if they were crowded. She added that she expected the federal government to reimburse the city for the cost of the facility.
 Officials with the city and the state said Billie Jean King and other temporary sites treated so few patients because New York’s statewide shutdown curtailed the virus and hospitals expanded their own capacity, reducing the need for extra beds.
 “The alternative space was less used than we expected it to be because we broke the curve, thank goodness,” Bray said.
 Doctors disagreed.
 “The conditions in the emergency room during this crisis were unacceptable and dangerous,” said Dr. Timothy Tan, director of clinical operations at the Queens Hospital Center emergency department. “Knowing what our patients had to endure in an overcrowded emergency department, it’s frustrating how few patients were treated at facilities such as Billie Jean King.”

Misery is no exception for exploitation, as can be vouched by the business flourishing over the corpses of persons who died of COVID-19 infection.
 Private agencies are charging anything upward of ₹30,000 for disposal of each body, right under the nose of GHMC which is largely responsible for cremation of COVID-19 dead bodies. What’s more, the agencies are doing it in the name of GHMC!
 “I am authorised by the GHMC to dispose of the COVID-19 dead bodies. The money I collect too is approved by the corporation. We have to spend a lot on ambulance, PPE gear for the handlers and the relatives, and funeral charges,” says Sk Vali, a person who is involved in the business. Ramanjeet Singh, a Good Samaritan ensuring decent funeral services for the COVID-19 dead bodies, says he was forced to shell out ₹25,000 for each body he helped dispose.
 “We were told to deposit the amount purportedly in the account of a GHMC Health official, and that the money would go to the committee constituted by GHMC for dead body disposal. How can the corporation collect random charges without a government order for the same?” Mr. Singh questioned. Officials responsible flatly deny that the corporation has authorised anybody for the job. They, however, admit that GHMC is handling dead bodies from government hospitals alone. “We are taking care of COVID-19 dead bodies only from Gandhi Hospital, Osmania General Hospital, King Koti Hospital, Chest Hospital, and NIMS. While we had handled bodies from private hospitals too earlier when deaths were only in single digit numbers, now it is not possible,” said an official.
 GHMC too is now getting the job done by contractors, chosen through open tenders, officials informed. However, the corporation has not authorised anybody to offer it as commercial service, they say. Elaborate guidelines issued by the government in April stipulated that the private hospitals should work in coordination with GHMC officials, and the police for disposal of dead bodies. Hospital level committees should be formed with GHMC deputy commissioners and Assistant Commissioners of Police as members. Committee constituted by government to ensure adherence to these guidelines, is hardly monitoring the process now.
 Private agencies are cashing in on the helplessness of the kin who are left with little choice owing to the stigma associated with COVID-19, and the reluctance of local people surrounding several grave yards in city to allow cremation of the bodies. Instead of getting the grave yards opened through its Enforcement wing, GHMC is merely playing spectator to people’s misery.
 Cremation ground near ESI is the only place as of now where COVID-19 dead bodies are streaming in, be it through government or private agency.
 GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar, when sought his version, said the disposal of dead bodies is not handed over to any outside agency, and that the corporation is still doing the job.

One prominent Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is from the libertarian-leaning flank of the party, criticized federal policing.


  "We cannot give up liberty for security. Local law enforcement can and should be handling these situations in our cities but there is no place for federal troops or unidentified federal agents rounding people up at will," Paul said in a tweet Monday.


  The protests have roiled Portland for 52 nights. Many rallies have attracted thousands and been largely peaceful. But smaller groups of up to several hundred people have focused on federal property and local law enforcement buildings, at times setting fires to police precincts, smashing windows and clashing violently with local police.


  Portland police used tear gas on multiple occasions until a federal court order banned its officers from doing so without declaring a riot. Now, concern is growing that the tear gas is being used against demonstrators by federal officers instead.


  Anger at the federal presence escalated on July 11, when a protester was hospitalized with critical injuries after a U.S. Marshals Service officer struck him in the head with a less-lethal round. Video shows the man, identified as Donavan LaBella, standing across the street from the officers holding a speaker over his head when he was hit.


  Court documents filed in cases against protesters show that federal officers have posted lookouts on the upper stories of the courthouse and have plainclothes officers circulating in the crowd. Court papers in a federal case against a man accused of shining a laser in the eyes of Federal Protective Service agents show that Portland police turned him over to U.S. authorities after federal officers identified him.


  Mayor Ted Wheeler, who's has been under fire for his handling of the protests, said on national TV talk shows Sunday that the demonstrations were dwindling before federal officers engaged.


  "They are sharply escalating the situation. Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. And it's not helping the situation at all," Wheeler said on CNN's "State of the Union."


  "They're not wanted here. We haven't asked them here," Wheeler said. "In fact, we want them to leave."


  Indeed, crowds of demonstrators had begun to dwindle a week ago, and some in the liberal city — including Black community leaders — had begun to call for the nightly demonstrations to end.


  But by the weekend, the presence of federal troops and Trump's repeated references to Portland as a hotbed of "anarchists" seemed to give a new life to the protests and attract a broader base.


  On Sunday night, a crowd estimated at more than 500 people gathered outside the courthouse, including dozens of self-described "moms" who linked arms in front of a chain-link fence outside the courthouse. The demonstration continued into Monday morning.


  "It seems clear that there were at least some federal crimes committed here," said Steve Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas. "But the notion that a handful of federal crimes justifies a substantial deployment of federal law enforcement officers … to show force on the streets is, to my mind, unprecedented."


  "Federal law enforcement," Vladeck said, "is not a political prop."

If ever we could use a balm from the ways of our messed up world, now is the time. One method I've found to escape from reality over the years is through the movies. And though trips to the cinema are on hold, our TV sets are where most current movies are finding homes.      Yes, there's a lot of emotional turmoil and grisly horror in much of today's film fare, but once in a while, something pleasant slips through. "Fisherman's Friends" is one of those. It's a real charmer, a gentle and funny little film that would be a perfect half of a twin bill with ""The Full Monty." It's been kicking around for a couple of years, had a release in its native England in early 2019, and is finally seeing the light of day in the U.S.      Based on true events from 2009, but fictionalized left and right, it tells the unlikely story of a bunch of small-town men, most of them lobster fishermen, all close friends, in the village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, who, after a hard day out on the water, would retire to their local pub, The Golden Lion, for a few pints and a lengthy singalong of traditional sea shanties.      No, nothing all that unlikely there. That part comes in with the introduction of four city dwellers, visiting Port Isaac for a day of yachting, hearing the 10 men - known collectively as Fisherman's Friends - singing, and believing that they could be the next successful boy band or, as mentioned in a quick visual gag, buoy band.      These visitors work at a music management company in London and are always on the lookout for the next big thing. But their belief in Fisherman's Friends is a gag, one that three of the four don't let the fourth city boy in on, and coerce into getting the 10 a cappella singers to sign on.      OK, that's not quite the way the real story played out, but the film's version works just fine. The city boys think the villagers are rubes, and the villagers think the city boys are wankers. Truth is - at least the truth told in the film - they are wankers, though Danny (Daniel Mays), whose leg his pals are pulling, appears to be a decent fellow, and is only doing the job his fun- loving but uncaring boss Troy (Noel Clarke) has ordered him to do.      By the time Danny catches on, he's already convinced the initially uncooperative fisherman and group frontman Jim (James Purefoy) to take a chance with him, and has given his word that they'll be treated honorably. When his boss tells him to end the charade, he can't, because he's a man of his word.      That's about as dramatic as the film gets, and in its lengthy-feeling two-hour running time, there's a lot of filler for viewers to deal with. The tough, hearts-of-gold fishermen continually rag on good-natured Danny, but nothing develops from that. There's a two-minute segment of trouble from the Coastal Guard, but that fizzles out. Tempers flare during a trivia night at the pub, and are immediately quashed. There's a boating accident, a daring rescue and a concussion. But that's never mentioned again.      The script tosses in a love interest for Danny - Jim's divorced daughter, and single mom, Alwyn (Tuppence Middleton), and offers up back stories on Jim's sometimes negative attitude, Jim's father Jago's (David Hayman) history with the sea, and a fleeting mention of Danny once being in rehab. But it turns out to be a stream of small stories that keep starting, don't go anywhere, and are forgotten, and then there's another small story.      The only other bits of drama that do take root involve some money problems that could affect the fate of The Golden Lion AKA the heart of the village, and the plot point that reduces the number of singing fishermen from 10 to nine (With so much of the story being fictionalized, did the filmmakers really need to keep a death in there?)      But aside from those instances, the film is unrepentantly upbeat, even featuring some last-minute extremely happy storytelling to cap it off. It's not very believable, and kind of twee, but that part really did happen.      "Fisherman's Friends" will be available on digital and On Demand beginning July 24.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Fisherman's Friends"   Written by Piers Ashworth, Meg Leonard, and Nick Moorcroft; directed by Chris Foggin   With James Purefoy, Daniel Mays, David Hayman, Tuppence Middleton   Rated PG-13

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed a memorandum Tuesday that seeks to bar people in the U.S. illegally from being counted in congressional reapportionment, a move that drew immediate criticism from Democratic officials.The Supreme Court blocked the administration's effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form, with a majority saying the administration's rationale for the citizenship question — to help enforce voting rights — appeared to be contrived.Trump said in the memorandum that he had determined that "respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base, to the extent feasible and to the maximum extent of the President's discretion under the law."The presidential memorandum is expected to draw legal challenges."There is no end to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant agenda," said Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. First, he tried to put a citizenship question on the census but got blocked by the Supreme Court. Now he's back at it with an unconstitutional order that has no purpose other than to silence and disempower Latino voices and communities of color."The Census Bureau said last month that more than 90 million households had already responded to the 2020 Census with the majority doing it online. People can still respond on their own online, over the phone or by mail — all without having to meet a census taker. Only this week, door-knockers started heading out to households in six areas whose residents hadn't yet answered the questionnaire. Opponents of the citizenship question said it would discourage participation by immigrants and residents who are in the country illegally, resulting in inaccurate figures for a count that determines the distribution of some $675 billion in federal spending and how many congressional districts each state gets.Trump's efforts to add the citizenship question had drawn fury and backlash from critics who alleged that it was intended to discourage participation in the survey, not only by people living in the country illegally but also by citizens who fear that participating would expose noncitizen family members to repercussions.____Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

BILLERICA -- The final vote cast in favor of hiring Shawsheen Valley Technical High School's newest superintendent-director position, Brad Jackson reflected on the upcoming school year and acclimating to a new district.


  Jackson, who had been Holliston's superintendent of schools since 2004, was chosen after the first search for the superintendent was suspended earlier in the spring. Originally, Jackson sought a shorter, two-year contract, which took him out of the running.


  After the suspension in April, Jackson was interviewed again by the Shawsheen Valley Technical High School School Committee, which then agreed to the shorter contract.


  The committee voted unanimously 10-0, and the Superintendent Search Committee also voted unanimously in favor of hiring Jackson.

  Jumping into the district on July 1, Jackson said the transition with former interim Superintendent-Director Melanie Hagman has been positive.


  "Actually it's been very smooth," said Jackson, who lives in Wilmington, one of the towns Shawsheen serves. "I finished my other position on (June) 30, so I hit the ground running. Melanie's office is right next to mine, so it is a short walk when I have questions, which is very helpful."


  Multiple calls to Hagman's office for comment were not returned.


    Holliston School Committee selects Susan Kustka as interim superintendent  


  Among Jackson's short list of things to achieve before the projected start of school, the top item, as in all districts, is how Shawsheen will reopen to students and staff, if at all.


  "We need to figure out what our reopening plan is for the fall, work on hiring a new director of student services, and any other hiring that needs to be done before the school year," he said.


  Jackson said he has been working in the building with a small staff since July 1.


  "I am coming to the office every day," he said.


    #ConfabNE: Do you feel safe sending your kids back to school this year? Here's what you said.  


  He said it was tough leaving Holliston, where he was named Massachusetts Superintendent of the Year for 2020, before graduation.


  "I really developed quite a sympathy for the seniors and what they were going through," he said.


  Jackson said after 16 years in the district and not being able to say goodbye to colleagues face to face, he had a certain sense of the lack of closure that seniors and their families felt.


  He said he did take the opportunity to watch the Shawsheen ceremonies, which were held over three days, depending on shop class.


  "Because I live so close, I took the chance to sneak over and stand in the grove," said Jackson. "They went really well."

If ever we could use a balm from the ways of our messed up world, now is the time. One method I've found to escape from reality over the years is through the movies. And though trips to the cinema are on hold, our TV sets are where most current movies are finding homes.      Yes, there's a lot of emotional turmoil and grisly horror in much of today's film fare, but once in a while, something pleasant slips through. "Fisherman's Friends" is one of those. It's a real charmer, a gentle and funny little film that would be a perfect half of a twin bill with ""The Full Monty." It's been kicking around for a couple of years, had a release in its native England in early 2019, and is finally seeing the light of day in the U.S.      Based on true events from 2009, but fictionalized left and right, it tells the unlikely story of a bunch of small-town men, most of them lobster fishermen, all close friends, in the village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, who, after a hard day out on the water, would retire to their local pub, The Golden Lion, for a few pints and a lengthy singalong of traditional sea shanties.

We’re now at the stage of the COVID-19 pandemic where Donald Trump and his allies are trying to suppress information about the coronavirus’s spread — because, of course, they are. True to form, however, they’re far behind the curve. From a political point of view (which is all they care about), their disinformation efforts are too little, too late.


  Where we are: In just a few days millions of Americans are going to see a drastic fall in their incomes, as enhanced unemployment benefits expire. This calls for urgent action; but avoiding economic calamity was always going to be hard, because Republicans in general have balked at providing the aid workers idled by the pandemic need.

Next month, on August 13, Marked By Covid will hit the streets for a national day of action. Volunteers will "support actions in current and burgeoning covid-19 hotspots; local constituents will create vigils and ofrendas outside of their elected officials' offices to honor the lives lost to coronavirus, raise awareness of the severity of the pandemic, and challenge their leaders to only reopen when it's safe."


  Abbott hasn't responded publicly to the letter and didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.


  But his stance on masks has certainly changed.


  Initially resistant to a shutdown and a mask mandate, Abbott said on Monday that "we strongly encourage everyone, to just very simply, for a few months, wear a face mask whenever you go into public. That way you can make sure you do your part to slow the spread of COVID-19 and you do your part to save lives."


  While there is no statewide mandate requiring masks in Arizona, Gov. Ducey announced on June 17 that he would allow mayors to create their own restriction.


  Scottsdale was the first to make it mandatory starting June 19, with other major municipalities including Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff issuing their own later.


  In an emailed statement to CNN last week, Patrick Ptak, a spokesman for Gov. Ducey said, "Our hearts go out to the family and loved ones of Mark Anthony Urquiza. We know nothing can fully alleviate the pain associated with his loss, and every loss from this virus is tragic."


  He did not say whether the governor would attend the funeral.

The resolution states that, “The independent investigation team is to commence its work immediately and shall complete its investigation as expeditiously as possible”; however, despite landing the contract with Smith as the lead, the investigative panel is still missing the other two-thirds of the group. The council’s public safety committee is working to find a representative of law enforcement and a person who has served as a medical director to round out the review.
 The medical expert will be on board to examine the use of ketamine in McClain’s death. Public safety committee chairwoman Allison Hiltz told Colorado Politics that they have a list of names and are “going through the process of determining who will be the best fit.”
 The process has been slow and laborious. Hiltz advised Mayor Mike Coffman during the City Council’s study session that they located a qualified person, but had to move on because that candidate had lived in Denver for 20 years, which is “too much crossover,” Hiltz explained.
 In addition to the City of Aurora’s independent investigation, the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department announced earlier this month that they have been reviewing McClain’s case since last year.
 There’s a third investigation being done by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who was appointed by Gov. Jared Polis as a special prosecutor to examine the case.
 Hiltz said the city will work in tandem with the Attorney General’s office’s investigation.
 Meanwhile, the McClain family is planning a separate investigation as it plans a civil rights lawsuit into Elijah’s death.
 The newly-approved resolution acknowledges these separate investigations into McClain’s death, promising it will not interfere with them as it explores its own answers.
 The city’s investigation is a direct response to recent protests following the death of George Floyd. Though McClain’s death happened almost a year ago, it has received international attention. Over 4.5 million people have signed a petition demanding justice for his death.
 Celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston, the Golden State Warriors’ Klay Thompson and TV host and comedian Ellen DeGeneres have taken on the cause. DeGeneres tweeted about the case last month.

Hong Kong once seemed like a model for how to control the coronavirus. Schools were open. Restaurants and malls buzzed with crowds. Buses and trains operated as usual, with residents dutifully wearing face masks on board.
 But a new wave of infections in recent days has put the city on edge. Hospitals are now seeing more cases a day than they ever have during the pandemic. More important, health officials are unable to determine the origin of many of these cases, despite having a robust contact tracing system in place.

I believe that in the long term the Asia-Pacific market could be self- sufficient, perhaps with imports from the Middle East. However, markets such as Hong Kong and Japan and Singapore will always need to rely upon inter- regional trade for hydrogen coming from places such as Australia or New Zealand, especially green hydrogen. Places such as Japan and Singapore just don't have the ability to produce their own hydrogen. So you will see a lot of inter-regional trade. And that's what some of the countries are betting on. But in the longer term, the region itself should be potentially self- sufficient.

“We’ve got a lot invested with this as well,” she said. “Unfortunately, my recommendation would be the same as (Clerk/Treasurer Mo Hansen).”
 Ellsworth and Lang requested the minimum payment requirement as part of the developer’s agreement with the city be temporarily removed for two years.
 They also requested a municipal guaranty included in the original developer’s agreement be extended by an additional four years. The original guaranty was for seven years and will conclude in January 2021.
 “August of each year is the time that our credit line is rolled over into the next year. Our bank has made it clear that under the present income and loss conditions of 575 W. Madison St, this year’s renewal will be difficult. In any case, the Guarantee remains essential to support that financing,” the owners wrote in an email to the city.
 Ellsworth, who attended the meeting remotely, said if the owners are unable to obtain the guaranty, the chances of being able to obtain financing “will go to zero. We’re trying to buy time to get out of this market we’re in now.”
 Clerk/Treasurer Mo Hansen noted the city assessor has reduced the value of the property by a bit more than 30% for 2021 so in that year, the tax bill will be less than the guaranteed tax incremental finance (TIF) revenue of $42,229. Historically the property value has been $1.7 million; the new value is $1.1 million.
 “The reason for the developer revenue guaranty is to cover debt the city took out in the first quarter of 2014 to finance a $100,000 cash incentive to the developer that was part of an issuance of debt that was $900,000 with $800,000 for this project,” Hansen said. “That wraps up in 2023.”
 Hansen said there is a value to lenders by having the city back a loan guaranty.
 “On the front end, it’s a non-monetary item,” he said. “On the back end, in an adverse lending situation, it puts the city in a position where it obligates a tax revenue specific to tax incremental district 2 revenue to cover that in a circumstance where the city would have to step in and act to guarantee a lending that’s gone south; that would be a reason to extend it.
 “And a reason to let it expire … is simply because in December of 2013 when we went down this path the city stepped up to sell a $1.7 million property for basically $1,” Hansen said. “We incentivized it with $100,000 in cash and we gave a municipal loan guaranty covering up to $400,000 in project debt. A reason to not further engage the city in the process is the city has been an enduring partner for these last seven years and we’ve done our duty. … We have to make a decision as a public entity to how long we want to engage in assisting with our major office property in our community.”
