Pay off outstanding debts, particularly high-cost debts like credit card balances. Without excess debt looming over your head, there is more breathing room in your budget. Once you have paid off credit card debts, begin paying off auto loans, mortgages, etc. The ultimate goal is becoming debt-free. Without debt, you are free to explore more opportunities in life. Furthermore, a sense of security during these difficult economic times provides peace of mind knowing you will not become the next family struggling to keep up with their living expenses. Minimizing and/or eliminating debt is a great tip at any time, especially during times of economic uncertainty.

The National Hurricane Center gave it 70% odds of further development into a tropical depression or storm. The offshore waters are warm enough and the winds aloft light enough to allow it to organize a bit more as it tracks toward Cape Hatteras on Thursday.
 It's a high potential for what would ultimately be a low-end system.
 The main effect will be heavy rain along and near its path, though other hazards may include minor coastal flooding, dangerous seas for small boats and a high risk of rip currents at nearby beaches.
 The immediate coastline could feel some peak onshore gusts to 35 mph by Thursday night, or 40 mph if it attains tropical storm strength.

The majority clarified that _Hosanna Tabor_ did not demand a "rigid" formula for courts evaluating ministerial exception claims by religious employers. _Hosanna Tabor_ had held that a Lutheran schoolteacher was a minister, making reference to her extensive training, her being "called" by her church, her self-identification and her functions. The Ninth Circuit -- the lower court that had previously decided the _OLOG_ case -- applied these categories to the Catholic school teachers and concluded that their situations did not match the Lutheran teacher's.

When Gordon reveals he faked his own death, Harvey Dent tells Gordon he must like to play things close to the chest.
 The line normally wouldn't make you think twice, but it's an odd callback to a line Bruce Wayne drops to Lucius Fox about 22 minutes prior in the film. Wayne mentions a government telecommunications project Fox didn't know about. Wayne said it's because he was "playing this one pretty close to the chest."
 Gordon never tells Harvey earlier in the film that he likes playing things close to the chest. Dent may just be making a comment about Gordon getting shot in the chest, but the line directly mirrors and calls back the moment between Wayne and Fox. Harvey's not aware of the conversation Wayne had and it would almost make more sense if Bruce and Gordon were exchanging the line.
 You can write it off as a common phrase, but director Christopher Nolan isn't one to casually throw a similar line like that in there twice. It's presumed that Gordon had a similar conversation earlier with Dent off-screen to the one that transpired between Wayne and Fox.
 Why go through all that trouble? It shows how Gordon and Batman are aligned in their common pursuit to relentlessly battle for Gotham's soul.
 For what it's worth, the line is only said once in the film's novelization between Dent and Gordon.

Is there really no image maker to tell ?! And the Minister of Health ?! Another, at least, would have long resigned, this is all for nothing. Now he quarreled with Georgia out of the blue, then he blames his predecessor, then the whole system of medicine. Only one of his few speeches was on the topic - he recently stated that Armenia is negotiating the acquisition of a vaccine against coronavirus, which is not yet available.

Each shooter is assigned a mask, gun, washable paintballs and “air all day.” Grimsley credits the businesses’ success to marketing and the business acumen he learned observing an attorney friend while working in Miami.
 “He is one of the top lawyers in the country and I watched how he ran his business,” he said. “His work ethic was incredible – he worked seven days a week.”
 Grimsley said paintball is only the first of numerous sports he wants to bring to the center, with the next being a bungee trampoline.
 According to Grimsley, the business has had a great deal of international visitors, including people from places such as Nigeria and Egypt.
 “I would like to see more locals here, since last year 85 percent of our players were from out of the country,” Grimsley said. “It’s a great place to have a birthday, corporate – for team bonding - or really any kind of party.”
 RJ Hinson Sports Paintball offers play packages for two to eight players for ages 8 to 80, with no time limit. Parties, however, are limited to one hour to play and 30 minutes for the party portion, that includes pizza from Little Caesars.
 Grimsley and his wife, Samantha, live in Poinciana with their five sons ages 12, 10, 8, 7 and 5. He said the boys like to play at the center with their friends.
 “It’s all fun and games,” he said. “Kids love it. Parents love it. It’s a time to remember.”

Look, I don’t doubt that Spycloud — a pretty unassuming company whose primary pitch seems to be helping businesses keep tabs on their own breaches — has its heart in the right place here. As the company points out on its own site, getting access to a database, could, in theory, tip an enterprise or authority off about how this data got hacked, and which hacker did that hack in the first place. One prosecuting attorney told Vice that this sort of data — while not widely used — does, in fact, often “[connect] some data points that we didn’t have before.”
 That’s great and all, but there’s still something about this service that makes me a bit uncomfortable. Maybe it’s because that same page on the Spycloud website boasts about how they could potentially be handing these cops “highly enriched PII” like “first and last names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, SSNs,” and 150 other types of data. Maybe it’s because I’ve seen firsthand how easy it is for these sorts of data breaches to ruin someone’s life if they get into the wrong hands. Maybe it’s because I’ve been the victim of a data breach myself, and maybe you have, too.
 There’s also the fact that agencies like the DOJ — a confirmed Spycloud customer — can get this data behind our backs. While warrantless collection of this sort of data is typically a major slap in the face to the Fourth Amendment, federal authorities in our country have a storied history of bypassing those pesky legal requirements by repurposing data that’s already available commercially to surveil anyone they want — even if those people have already been subjected to something as shitty as a data breach.
 Right now, Utah is the only state that’s taken a stand against this sort of unfettered data collection. For now, those of us in every other state just need to settle into the discomfort of knowing the data created by our commutes, our protests, and the fronts of our doorsteps can be used to track our every move. Sometimes, that data just happens to be stolen.

 Virginia's investigators and forensic scientists tested 2,665 kits, uploaded 851 new DNA profiles into the national DNA database, and sent 354 matches to law enforcement agencies for further investigation, Herring said.
 Charges are already pending against one man as a result of the project, and officials anticipate more charges may be filed in light of new evidence, the attorney general said.
 The mandatory use of a physical evidence recovery kit (PERK) tracking system will ensure kits are submitted for testing in a timely manner going forward, eliminating future backlogs, said Linda Jackson, director of the Virginia Department of Forensic Sciences.

ROME, July 8 (Reuters) - Troubled AS Roma ended a run of three successive Serie A defeats with a 2-1 win over Parma, who were angered after having a penalty turned down late in the game on Wednesday.
 Parma took an earlier lead when Andreas Cornelius went down in the area, the referee awarded a penalty after consulting the pitchside monitor, and Juraj Kucka converted.
 Henrikh Mkhitaryan levelled with an emphatic finish from a Bruno Peres cross two minutes before halftime and Jordan Veretout won it for fifth-placed Roma with a long-range shot just before the hour.
 Parma claimed they should have had another spot-kick for handball by Gianluca Mancini but, after another pitchside review, the referee decided it was not a penalty. Minutes later, Gervinho had a goal disallowed for the visitors.
 "I don't see how he could not give that penalty....we can't accept this type of mistake," said Parma general manager Alessandro Lucarelli. "We are being penalised by refereeing decisions."
 Torino pulled themselves away from the relegation zone with a 3-1 win over Brescia in the evening's other game.
 Ernesto Torregrossa gave Brescia, one place off the bottom, a halftime lead but second-half goals from Simone Verdi, Andrea Belotti and Simone Zaza turned it around for Torino, who are 14th and seven points clear of the danger zone. (Reporting by Brian Homewood, editing by Ed Osmond)

The Joker interrupts an interview on the Gotham Cable Network (GCN) offering an ultimatum. If Wayne employee Colman Reese isn't killed in the next hour then he'll blow up a hospital.
 Commissioner Jim Gordon goes to evacuate Reese from GCN, leading to a series of close calls on the man's life. But it's not clear why he felt it necessary to take Reese on a ride through Gotham's notoriously dangerous streets in the first place.
 It probably would have been safer if they just waited it out inside the GCN skyscraper where the public couldn't get into the building. Even if they broke into the first floor, surely they wouldn't have had keycard access to elevators and the GCN office for the next 60 minutes.

BOSTON - Opponents of a proposed ballot question that would increase access to automobile data formally objected to its eligibility Wednesday, echoing an argument that has so far blocked a congressional candidate from making the ballot in a separate case.
 The Coalition for Safe and Secure Data, a manufacturer-backed group organized to fight the question, submitted a challenge Wednesday that will prompt a state panel to decide whether the proposal can go before voters on Nov. 3.
 In their challenge, the coalition argued that the third-party company used by the campaign disobeyed electronic signature-gathering requirements outlined by the Supreme Judicial Court by storing signatures in a separate file and tracking personal data without notification.
 "The signature gathering effort used by ballot question proponents not only violated public policy and failed to meet the standards outlined by the court, it also put the personal information of more than 24,000 Massachusetts voters at risk for potential misuse, hacking and identity theft," said Conor Yunits, a spokesperson for the coalition.
 The State Ballot Law Commission, a five-member panel appointed by the governor, must now decide whether the question -- one of two headed toward the ballot -- is eligible to reach the ballot.
 Thanks to an April 29 SJC ruling, initiative petition supporters were allowed to collect e-signatures during the final round of the process as a way to limit COVID-19 risks. However, voters had to submit their e-signatures directly into the forms and had to be alerted about what personal information was being collected and why, roughly similar to the e-signatures guidelines given to candidates for office in an earlier decision.
 The new filing before the ballot law commission comes less than two weeks after the same panel deemed Helen Brady ineligible to make the ballot for the 9th Congressional District because of issues with her signature-gathering vendor, VenueX -- the same company allegedly used by the right-to-repair campaign.
 By storing electronic signatures in a separate file and importing them into the nomination papers, VenueX and by extension Brady violated the requirement to submit "native" signed documents for certification, the SBLC ruled.
 Brady, who plans to appeal the decision, told the News Service that she believed 39 other candidates for office hired VenueX to help gather e-signatures amid the pandemic.
 The SBLC cannot intervene, however, unless a party challenges a candidate or campaign's eligibility, and Brady was the only one to draw an objection on such grounds.
 Her precedent does not guarantee an outcome in the ballot question case, and the SBLC will now need to decide whether the proposal to update the state's 2012 law outlining access to vehicle information can appear on the general election ballot.
 Tommy Hickey, a spokesman for the supporters' group, said in a statement Wednesday that the campaign collected signatures "over multiple platforms, based on the guidance of regulators."
 "Our coalition got more than 100,000 signatures last fall and collected 24,000 signatures this spring from voters who want to maintain a choice on where to get their car repaired," he said. "This is yet another sign of the large automakers trying to monopolize the repair market and leave Massachusetts consumers, who voted 86% in favor of this in 2012, and independent repair shops in the dust."
 Their 24,000 recent signatures cleared the required threshold of 13,374. Secretary of State William Galvin is still reviewing the submission, along with those filed by supporters of a proposal to implement ranked-choice voting in Massachusetts.
 The so-called right-to-repair question would require car manufacturers to make more telematic data available to independent repair shops, a step that backers say will ensure that consumers have more options for maintenance as vehicles continue to add more complicated digital components.
 Opponents argue that making the data more available will create significant privacy concerns, a point they raised again as they filed Wednesday's challenge about how voter signatures were handled.
 "This was a stunning preview of what could happen if the question passes, because the same people who okayed this plan also made sure not to include any protections for cybersecurity, privacy or personal safety in the ballot question itself," Yunits said. "Not only should this question be struck from the ballot, but the proponents should be required to contact everyone who signed their petition and warn them that their data has been exposed, just as any other major national corporation would do in the event of a data breach."
 Debate over the topic has been fierce since the ballot question campaign launched last year, and both sides of the issue have significant support from industry interest groups.
 The coalition of opponents has received more than $1.6 million in donations from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers, according to records with the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance.
 Similarly, the Right to Repair Coalition has brought in more than $1 million, including $500,000 from the Auto Care Association that represents aftermarket manufacturers and dozens of donations from independent shops, OCPF data show.

To help simplify charging on laptops, Intel will also require notebook makers to include at least one Thunderbolt 4 port for charging on systems that draw less than 100 watts of power, while also mandating the Thunderbolt 4 notebooks must be capable of being woken up via keyboard or mouse input when connected to a Thunderbolt 4 dock.
 So when will Thunderbolt 4 become available? Intel said it expects to start shipping out new 8000 series Thunderbolt 4 controllers to device makers later this year. On the laptop side, Intel says Thunderbolt 4 will be available first on systems featuring its upcoming Tiger Lake CPUs and systems part of its Project Athena initiative, which are also expected to become available sometime starting in late 2020.

Most college football games remain on the calendar as scheduled, but it remains unclear if they’ll be played, or when official announcements will be made on a decision. At the moment, teams are able to hold voluntary workouts, lift weights and review film. On July 24, teams will be able to participate in walk-throughs and have team meetings for up to 20 hours a week. Preseason practice can begin on Aug. 7.
 Frost told The World-Herald last week that the general feeling on if there will be football has changed “two dozen times” this summer.
 “Recently, we feel like there’s going to be football, we’re just not sure what that’s going to look like,” Frost said.
 Nebraska has been preparing contingency plans for different scenarios, Frost said, including a spring season or a conference-only slate. Frost said that “0%” of Big Ten coaches would be in favor of an all-league schedule, though there have been reports indicating that's a possibility.
 Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley, from the Big 12, told Yahoo last week that, if absolutely needed, spring football is “very doable.”
 The logistics, though, are much different than the Ivy League, which would only need seven or eight weeks to complete a season. The major conferences typically play up to 12 games in a full season.
 If play does occur in the spring, questions then arise as to when the next college football season could begin, and if student-athletes would have enough time to recover between the potential end of season in May and start of the next season in the fall.
 “This season is going to be different, we might as well come to terms with that,” Riley said. “If we do decide that the spring is the best option, if we get to that point, we shouldn’t be scared of it.”

Davenport is among the fastest growing cities in the county, state and even the nation.
 In 2015, the population of the northern Polk County municipality was 2,888. Today, there are more than 12,000 people who call it home. That is roughly a 300 percent increase and there is seemingly no end in sight to the trend as there are currently 35 housing developments in the works.
 Originally from Michigan, Pierson and her husband, Kirk, moved here about 17 years ago. The couple, who have been married for 45 years, have four children and five grandchildren.
 “We need to embrace what the city wants to be — what it can be,” she said. “We need to get in (commercially) from the beginning and not be reactive, but proactive.”
 In addition to building relationships with local leaders and neighboring EDCs, Pierson has had some contact with potential businesses and corporations.
 “We have had a number of fruitful engagements,” Pierson said. “We are at least getting good prospects looking at possibilities.”
 Davenport was first put on the map in 1838, as a settlement, when the U.S. military set up Fort Davenport during the Second Seminole War. Davenport was incorporated in 1915.
 “There is a lot of history here in Davenport and we want to be mindful of that,” Pierson said. “We want to protect our history while building for the future.”

So as you move forward in economics, new things begin to be introduced. Like gravity, which is of course a major part of our lives and affects every piece of physics we study, classes eventually begin to introduce real-life application of economics and show that, no, not everyone behaves rationally.
 So introducing a one-sided approach to economic recovery shows a distinct lack of overall knowledge of the economy - that it takes at least two to tango, business and consumer.
 History has shown that 'trickle-down' and 'trickle-up' economics are both fascinating theories to cover in academic settings, but fall short in addressing long-term economic growth. In the short-term? Sure, providing businesses with incentives to grow and consumers with extra cash to spend will make the economy rebound. But notice that both sides of the equation were provided with the means to boost the economy, not just one.
 Why? Because neither side can be trusted to act rationally after a certain amount of time. Trickle-down, or corporate-based economics, shows that businesses will hold on to every penny they can. We've been doing this since the mid-80s by providing low corporate tax rates and allowing for businesses to dodge taxes in many different ways, all while wages continue to stagnate.
 On the other hand, trickle-up shows that consumers will eventually begin to act with total irrtionality toward spending - consuming in an unsustainable manner.
 Far too often we seek the easy way out, especially when it comes to converging the teachings of academia and the applications in real life. Society seeks the 'easy way out' with the 'one time explanation' that will solve all the problems.
 What's been proven, time and time again, is that just doesn't work. The world we live in has a plethora of moving parts that all form a very complex engine. Seeking that one answer would be akin to replacing a fuel line in a car who's engine is on fire.
 Balance is the approach that must be taken when trying to fix the economy. Consumers and businesses alike must be considered in future economic stimulus, because both groups need help if th economy is to reboot.
 Because, let's be frank - unemployment is enough to keep a family alive. 50% of median income is nothing to move forward the economic needle, so the market will need more of a push than just that. Businesses, as well, have employees that cannot or will not return to work - that return must be provided with incentive.
 The country must legislate in real time, not the way one side thinks is right.

LITTLE ROCK – This year, the Fourth of July will be quieter than any in our lifetime. That will be most obvious, perhaps, in small towns such as Piggott, where July 4th is the biggest event of the year.
 July 4th in Piggott is the kind of small-town family-friendly Independence Day celebration many of us remember. It is a homecoming, carnival, and political event rolled into one day that ends with fireworks. Many a politician has campaigned at the Piggott Fourth of July Picnic. I attended my first one in 1986, and I campaigned there when I was running for governor in 2014.
 But this year, the COVID-19 pandemic forced Piggott to cancel its picnic, carnival, beauty contest, and fried-chicken dinner for the first time since 1931. The fireworks show is the only tradition the city didn’t cancel.
 The picnic is Piggott Cemetery Association’s biggest fundraiser. Fred Ort is president of the Association, and he’s not sure how the association will make up the lost funds, but he’s confident it will.
 Fred’s family moved to Piggott when he was 12, and he has attended every picnic since then. He’s 68 years old.
 In past years, the carnival would already be up and running and members of the association would be busy with final preparations. He said life feels a little empty and eerie at the moment.
 But the town’s leaders decided to go ahead with the fireworks show at 10 o’clock Saturday night. Most people watch from their own yards any way, and you can see the display from the outskirts of Piggott, population 3,700, so there won’t be a crowd in one place.
 I like Piggott’s spirit. The businesses and churches have followed health guidelines to protect their residents. The school district canceled athletic programs and postponed graduation until late July. The cemetery association canceled the traditional picnic, its primary source of money and a source of pride for the city.
 In the midst of it all, they found a way to safely preserve a sliver of their tradition with the fireworks show. Saturday night, members of the fire department will light up the sky.
 The spirit of Piggott is the spirit of Arkansas, and the spirit of Arkansas is the spirit of American independence that we celebrate on July the 4th. We work together, whether it’s a global pandemic or the growing pains of our republic. At the end of the day, we light up our skies to show we’re still here, and we’re still strong.
