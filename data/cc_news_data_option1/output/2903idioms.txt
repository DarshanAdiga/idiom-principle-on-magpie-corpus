WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s outrage over a Republican lawmaker’s verbal assault has broadened into an extraordinary moment on the House floor. Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats took to the House floor Thursday to demand an end to a sexist culture of “accepting violence and violent language against women.” They called out Florida GOP Rep. Ted Yoho, who had angrily confronted Ocasio-Cortez on the House steps this week and called her names. Yoho expressed some contrition this week, but Ocasio-Cortez rejected it as insufficient. Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues cast the incident as all-too-common behavior by men, including President Donald Trump and other Republicans.

“The consumer is stronger coming into this recession than into the Great Recession,” Discover Chief Financial Officer John Greene said on a call with analysts Thursday.
 Still, lenders are padding their reserves in the event that government aid dries up and consumers begin to sour.
 Discover, of Riverwoods, Ill., set aside $2 billion in provisions for credit losses during the second quarter, up from $1.8 billion three months prior, according to its earnings report Thursday. The move resulted in a $368 million loss for the quarter, compared with a $753 million profit during the same period last year.
 Synchrony, the lender behind many store-branded credit cards, reported on Tuesday a $1.7 billion provision during the quarter, about the same amount it set aside three months before but an increase of nearly 40% from one year ago. The Stamford, Conn., company’s net earnings declined 94% year over year to $48 million.
 Discover executives said they feel good about the reserve build so far, indicating the second quarter may be the high-water mark for provisions. In addition to increasing the capital cushion, Discover tightened underwriting “pretty significantly” on personal loans the company offers, Hochschild said.
 Hochschild said he is keeping especially close watch on unemployment figures.
 Just as the unemployment bonus is about to expire, the number of unemployment claims made for the week ending July 18 jumped by 109,000 from the previous week to more than 1.4 million, the Labor Department said Thursday. The increase broke a streak of weekly declines going back to the end of March when businesses closed to prevent spread of the virus. In total, almost 53 million unemployment claims have been filed over the past 18 weeks.
 “I’ve seen a lot of things, but nothing like this in terms of the speed and magnitude of the impact the pandemic has had on the economy,” Hochschild said on a call with analysts Thursday. “I don't think any of us in business have seen this.”

He was 5-4 with a 2.30 ERA in 25 starts across three minor league levels last season that included three starts at Triple-A Buffalo. He struck out 119 in 101 2/3 innings.

 " a Russian satellite called Kosmos 2543 launched an unidentified things into orbit"
 Kosmos 2543 is expected to be an inspector satellite, according to Russia, so coming close to another Russian satellite isn't odd habits. In reality, doing these close distance “inspections” has actually ended up being a continuous pattern for Russian satellites over the last years. “It’s mostly satellites coming close to other Russian satellites or other Russian rocket bodies slowly — like a slow approach over several days,” Brian Weeden, director of program preparation for the Secure World Foundation, informs _The Verge_ “And then they might back away, and then they’ll come close again, then they’ll hang out nearby. That’s the sort of thing we’ve been watching.”
 But the Kosmos 2543 probe has actually exceeded checking just Russian satellites. Kosmos 2543 was released by another Russian satellite called Kosmos 2542 in December2019 In January, satellite trackers discovered that the 2 satellites appeared to be stalking a United States spy satellite called U.S.A.245 United States Space Command paid attention to this strange habits, and authorities weren't pleased. “We view this behavior as unusual and disturbing,”Gen John “Jay” Raymond, leader of United States Space Command and chief of area operations for the United States Space Force, informed _Time_ inFebruary “It has the potential to create a dangerous situation in space.”
