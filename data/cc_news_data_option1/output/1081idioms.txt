The finals of the tournament were slated to be played on April 18 between Real Sociedad and Athletic Club, but it has been now postponed along with all other football action in Spain due to coronavirus outbreak.

The presidents of Athletic Club and Real Sociedad will be in the negotiations. But it is important to say that we want the final to be with fans," Goal.com quoted Rubiales president of Spanish FA (RFEF) as saying.   Football has been badly hit by the coronavirus.

Zurich [Switzerland], Mar 18 (ANI): FIFA president Gianni Infantino has proposed delaying next year's 24-team Club World Cup in order to have a smooth Euro Cup next year.   On Tuesday, UEFA decided to postpone the Euro 2020 next year due to COVID-19, and the organisers confirmed that the tournament will be played from June 11-July 11 next year.   South America's football governing body CONMEBOL also decided to postpone the COPA America amidst the coronavirus outbreak.   With these decisions, UEFA and CONMEBOL have put themselves at loggerheads with FIFA as the Club World Cup was slated to be played next year.   However, in an official statement, FIFA president confirmed that he will be holding a conference call with FIFA officials and said that he would indeed suggest moving the Club World Cup to a later date.   The FIFA Club World Cup was slated to be played in China next year, and there are speculations as to whether the tournament will go ahead in the country.

The growing government support to the development of solar power infrastructure is likely to be a major driver for the global solar backsheet market over the forecast period. Several developed countries have established solid solar power infrastructures with a view to acquiring all their power from renewable, environmentally viable methods. Developing countries such as India and China are also major players in the global solar power market due to the abundant availability of solar power in these countries and the high potential of solar power in terms of being able to replace conventional electricity generation procedures and emerge as a major source of power over the forecast period and beyond.

North America leads the global refurbished medical devices market due to the regions high adoption of medical devices and the resulting presence of a high volume of medical devices that may otherwise go to waste. Many organizations in the region refurbish medical devices for low-income bracket patients in the North American market. Europe and the Asia Pacific are neck and neck in terms of market size. However, it is likely that the Asia Pacific will make more significant progress during the review period due to the high adoption rate of refurbished medical devices in the many underdeveloped parts of the region. Emerging economies such as India, China, and many others have significant rural areas where the healthcare sector is expanding. Adoption of refurbished medical devices is expected to provide the regions healthcare sector with an overall boost. Meanwhile, the Middle East and Africa regional market have the smallest share of the market. However, the region displays potential due to the significant presence of poor countries where healthcare is a growing need.

One of the most interesting stories shared in the book is the account of how it took 108 years for Thomas and Elizabeth Coulthard‚Äôs gravestones to be placed on their burial site.
 ‚ÄúThe matching marble markers are thought to have been ordered by the family after Thomas died. The death dates for both were engraved when they were made. It is believed that George William and James Marco likely cut the limestone bases, as they were stone masons by trade. Perhaps due to the terrain and limited means of transportation, the markers were not placed at the cemetery, but instead traveled on a journey following the paths of various family members over many years before reaching their intended destination.‚Äù
 At one point, the markers were placed in the back of a pickup truck and ‚Äúutilized as weight for traction during the winter months.‚Äù From there, they ended up in a farmer‚Äôs field near Camp, where they were later found during plowing and propped up against a fence.
 ‚ÄúThe bases for the markers had ended up with Baldwin and Orilla Wolfe on Prater Lane in Marion. When Orilla broke up housekeeping in the 1950‚Äôs, the bases were moved to Kyle and Willie Scott‚Äôs house on Hutton Branch in Marion. As a child, their daughter Carol remembers playing in rainwater that puddled in the grooves on the top of them. The bases remained there until the markers were retrieved.
 ‚ÄúIn parallel with the marker chase, family descendants were still trying to obtain proof beyond oral history, as to where Thomas and Elizabeth were buried. The location was likely Rich Valley Presbyterian Church Cemetery, but they needed something definitive before approaching the church to request permission to erect the markers. Generations had passed and knowledge was lost. There were visits to many churches and cemeteries for clues and records. Courthouse records tracked the family‚Äôs moves, births and deaths. During a visit with her aunt, Sue McClure, Carol pointed to Thomas‚Äô photo and said, ‚ÄòTell me where you are buried.‚Äô On the way home, Carol began thinking about the years Seaver-Brown Funeral Home had been in business and wondered how far back they kept records. She soon went there and found the documented proof at last! It stated that Thomas‚Äô burial was at the ‚Äòbrick church‚Äô and ‚Äòbrick cemetery.‚Äô In 1896, the Presbyterian Church was the only brick church in Rich Valley.
 ‚ÄúThe monument company cleaned and prepared the markers and bases for installation.‚Äù
 The markers were finally placed on Oct. 2, 2004, 108 years after Thomas‚Äô death.
 Carol and the other Coulthard family researchers have left a treasure for future generations. Their countless hours of research and compilation will, no doubt, bless others as they go on their own pilgrimages to search for lost ancestors.
 A copy of the George William Coulthard Family Genealogy has been generously donated to the Marion branch of the Smyth County Public Library for those who share this family tree.

Tuesday was supposed to be opening day for the Sheldon softball team, with the reigning state champion Irish playing Thurston at home in their green and white uniforms on what turned out to be a warm, sunny and spectacular St. Patrick's Day afternoon.
   
 It would've been quite the site.
   
 Instead, Sheldon's softball field sat empty, as have fields, tennis courts and tracks at every high school in the state following the Oregon School Activities Association's decision to suspend games and practices in all sports through at least March 31 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
   
 "We were fired up," Sheldon coach Mike Faulconer said Monday afternoon. "We had every expectation of going out and having a great season. We have a lot of talent on the team, everything we need to go out and have another great year."
   
 There were people on the baseball field at Thurston on Tuesday afternoon, as coach Dennis Minium and some assistants raked the infield and picked weeds in an effort to keep the field in tip-top shape and ready for use -- whenever that might be.
   
 "Considering the expectations we had for us this year, this not how we wanted to start the season," Minium said. "It's been hard. Kids have worked so hard to get to this point and then all of a sudden we're just shut down."
   
 Before the season was put on hold, the Colts earned the distinction of being the top-ranked team in the Class 5A preseason coaches poll, which was released last week.
   
 Thurston was scheduled to open their season on Wednesday against the 6A Irish in a game under the lights at Oregon's PK Park. Then the Colts were packing for a spring break trip to Arizona to play in a four-game tournament.
   
 Obviously that's not happening, but Minium was hopeful on Monday that the team can get back together on April 1, with their Midwestern League season scheduled to start at Eagle Point on April 3.
   
 The last update posted by the OSAA came on March 13 when it released a statement that read: "During this suspension we will evaluate this evolving public health situation with the Oregon Health Authority, the Oregon Department of Education, the OSAA Executive Board, the OSAA Sports Medicine Advisory Committee and member school administrators from throughout the state to determine when, or if, to resume the spring season."
   
 Since then, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has barred all public gatherings of more than 25 people for the next four weeks and encouraged people to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. On Tuesday, she shut down schools statewide through April 28.
   
 "I'll be honest with you, I have no idea what's going to happen," he said. "I'm glad the OSAA hasn't jumped real quick and is kind of letting this play out and see what happens. Best-case scenario is school starts back up and we get to start."
   
 Minium said if he has to wait five more weeks, then that's what he'll do. He just wants his players to get to put their uniforms on at some point this spring.
   
 "What's going on right now is insane and scary," Minium said. "But those kids have worked so hard and it'll just be a shame if they don't get an opportunity to even play a modified schedule."
   
 The Midwestern League looked like it was going to be a wild ride this season. Besides the No. 1 Colts, the coaches poll also included No. 4 Churchill, No. 6 Crater and No. 9 Ashland.
   
 No. 9 South Eugene, with Oregon-bound star senior Bryce Boettcher leading the way, was the only Southwest Conference team ranked in the 6A poll.
   
 In Class 3A, No. 5 Pleasant Hill received a first-place vote and returns a talented team that lost in the state semifinals last year.
   
 With canceled practices, locked batting cages and limited contact, Minium said he has encouraged his players to not sit around and get lazy during the down time.
   
 "We told them it was important that they kept their arms in shape," Minium said. "We told them to get some guys together and do ground balls, hit fly balls, play catch.
   
 "With our pitchers, we've been working for a year to get arms in shape. It's important for our pitchers to keep their arms in shape, because come April 1, we don't know what the schedule is going to look like."
   
 It's the same situation at Sheldon, which returned six starters from its 2019 softball championship team, including state pitcher of the year Camille Leach.
   
 The Irish were ranked second in the Class 6A coaches poll behind Tualatin, the team it beat for the title last June.
   
 "All we told them was when we get to play again, be ready to go," Faulconer said. "That means take it upon yourself to stay in shape. I don't know what's going to happen or if we're going to have a season but I tell you what, we have a bunch of motivated kids and they're still hopeful. I'm sure they're not going to just sit around and watch Netflix."
   
 The Irish weren't the only softball team with high expectations this season. The Sky-Em League had three teams ranked in the 4A coaches poll -- No. 3 Junction City, No. 5 Marist and No. 10 Elmira.
   
 No. 2 North Douglas won its second Class 2A/1A state title in three seasons last year and has one more season of star senior pitcher Nicki Derrick.
   
 Like everyone else, it's a waiting game now to see if the OSAA cancels the spring season.
   
 "I want to play and I know our kids want to play," Faulconer said. "The sooner the better. I want to get out there and get to work and let these kids play."
