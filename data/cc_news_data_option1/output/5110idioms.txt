As for the menu, expect a mix of South Indian, tandoor and Continental, with Pan Asian round follow in a few months, we are told. "I have a different speciality chef consulting for each cuisine," Arasu tells us. Today, we meet Chef Kamal Kannan S -- a specialist in South Indian and coastal flavours. And we get our socks knocked off right away by the peppery Nenjelumbu Charu (tender lamb rib stock infused with whole spices). Great for a rainy day and even better if you are feeling under the weather, it is the perfect pick-me-up to start our meal with. And there is almost no wait time as a bevy if other appetisers arrive at our table. Our favourites include the crisp _Vazhaipoo_ cutlet dipped in a sweet beet sauce, a pillowy Olive _Malai Paneer Tikka_ and a succulent Mutton Green Roast tossed with a curry leaf paste and butter. We sip on a tall glass of light rum and sweet vermouth (Mask) with a splash of house-made almond milk, and that rum cuts right through. For a more subtle choice,  we recommend the gin and apricot -infused Morris Chair.

We get a hint of the sentiment behind the 3,800 sq feet of decor from N Velu Ammaiyappah, one of the partners in the venture. "I want this to be a space where the focus is bringing your friends or your family and enjoying yourself, not about turning up the volume and partying... " he tells us. This is reflected in the mellow decibel level that eases us into a relaxed sense of ease, with _Pretty Woman_ playing in the background. Velu who is in the construction biz co-runs the space with partners P Kamalakanan, K KrishnaVijay and AN Raghuram and has collaborated with brand consultant Arasu Dennis who has previously set up bars such as Off The Record and BOATS.

Joshua Vollmar's piece in the Dec. 4 2020 issue of the Groton Herald seems to want to try and put the issue to bed once and for all, and while I applaud the intent, I feel that Joshua and the Groton Herald are a little tone deaf here.
