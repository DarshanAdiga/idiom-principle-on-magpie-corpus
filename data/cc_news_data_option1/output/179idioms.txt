Similarly, relations between the CDS and the three Service Chiefs are one of primus inter pares among Generals who are equal and yet unequal. A Government statement read: "The CDS will not exercise any military command, including over the three Service Chiefs so as to be able to provide impartial advice to political leadership." This directive is badly drafted. Simply stated, the CDS will not ride roughshod over single-Service chiefs. But how this plays out on the ground only time and personalities of the Chiefs will tell. In the Army, three-star Lt Gen-rank Corps Commanders are subordinate to three-star Army Commanders of the same rank and pay-band. In the reporting channel, too, there is an implied problem. Would the Service Chiefs report to the Defence Minister through the CDS or access him directly, or via the Defence Secretary? Some of these wrinkles will no doubt get ironed out in the times to come.

The Office of Rail and Road's (ORR) annual estimates of station usage report revealed that 41.2m entries or exits were made in 2018-19, with 4,634,903 journeys made using the station as an interchange. It means Stratford remains seventh in the list of the UK's busiest stations - but is still a long way from being as busy as Waterloo, which tops the chart with more than 94m entries and exits. Birmingham New Street is the only non-London station to make the top 10, overtaking Euston to come in fifth with more than 47m journeys. Newham's second busiest station is West Ham, which is ranked 40th in the country with 10.7m entries and exits made in a year. Forest Gate saw more than 2.9 million journeys made, with Stratford International close behind with 2.8 million. The figures, which include Overground stations but not Tube or DLR ones, show 1.7m journeys were made to or from West Ham, and 1.2m to or from Maryland. Wanstead Park and Woodgrange Park, both on the Overground network, saw 886,990 and 764,600 journeys respectively. Both gained more than 170 places in the ranks - which may be, in part, due to a two-month closure on the Barking to Gospel Oak line in 2017-18 affecting that year's figures. Overall, there were 62.3m journeys made to or from Newham's stations - the same number as in 2016-17, and up from the 59.8m in 2017-18. That's more than double the 25.4m journeys made to or from the borough's stations in 2010-11. The experience of Newham's train passengers is a long way from those at Denton, in Greater Manchester, and Stanlow and Thornton in Cheshire - statistically Britain's least-used stations. They were both used by just 46 passengers in the year to March 31, 2019. Denton is served by one train a week in each direction, while Stanlow and Thornton has three trains each way per day, excluding Sundays.

CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — Clemson gave its weary fans something to celebrate a night after losing the national championship game in football, getting a career-high 25 points from Aamir Simms in a 79-72 upset of No. 3 Duke. It was the highest-profile upset for the Tigers since beating No. 1 North Carolina on their home court in February 2001. And just like that day, students rushed the court at Littlejohn Coliseum. It was the first ACC loss for the Blue Devils. The Tigers also beat North Carolina in Chapel Hill for the first time in program history Saturday, ending a 59-game losing streak on the Tar Heels' home court.CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly is retiring from the NFL after eight seasons. The 28-year-old Kuechly made the surprising announcement on the team’s website. Kuechly said he felt it was time to “move on.” Kuechly was selected to seven Pro Bowls and was a first-team All-Pro five times. He suffered three concussions during his career, which may have contributed to his decision. Kuechly fought back tears at times during his announcement. He did not specifically mention concussions but referenced the ongoing toll of the game on his body.CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — A person familiar with the situation says the Carolina Panthers have agreed to terms to make LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady their new offensive coordinator. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the Panthers have not confirmed the move. Brady worked closely with Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Joe Burrow, who led the Tigers to a win over Clemson in the national championship game. Brady is the first significant hire for new Panthers coach Matt Rhule. The 30-year-old Brady becomes the youngest offensive coordinator in the NFL. Under Brady, LSU led the nation in points scored and yards passing while going 15-0 on the season.UNDATED (AP) — Even if they don't meet again on the field, Clemson's Trevor Lawrence and Ohio State's Justin Fields will be two of the stories that will define the 2020 college football season. The quarterbacks will compete for the Heisman Trophy and maybe to be the first overall NFL draft pick. Everyone will be watching to see whether LSU has turned its matchup with Alabama back into a rivalry or was the Tigers' victory this season was a one- off led by a generational quarterback. And several coaches with lots to prove in 2020 will be sitting on various degrees of the hot seat.UNDATED (AP) — The final Associated Press Top 25 of the season has a familiar look. LSU is No. 1 after winning the national championship. Add Clemson, Ohio State, Georgia, Florida, Oklahoma and Alabama and you have seven of the preseason top 10 teams finishing in the top 10 five months later. For the first time since 2006 every preseason top 10 team finished the season ranked. The next AP Top 25 will be released in August.CHARLOTTE, N.C.

The Rev. Anna Guillozet knows this is a hard time to be in United Methodist ministry.  
 The 33-year-old senior pastor at Linworth United Methodist Church on the Northwest Side is struggling with her own emotions around a possible United Methodist denominational split, and trying to be there for her congregants.  
 "Being a reconciling church, there's just such anxiety with my people about will we be United Methodist? What will that look like?" said Guillozet, who is also a doctor of ministry student at the Methodist Theological Seminary in Ohio (MTSO). "It's hard to assist a local congregant in their anxiety when my anxiety is also high."  
 At a special session of the general conference in St. Louis last February, the United Methodist Church toughened its prohibitions on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy -- a decision progressives vowed to oppose.  
 On Jan. 3, a group of 16 United Methodist leaders, including the West Ohio bishop, released information on a plan they'd been working on called the "Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace through Separation."  
 The proposal spells out an amicable separation in which conservative churches would form a new denomination and retain their assets. Churches and pastors could decide which way to go -- to stay with the future progressive United Methodist Church or join the traditionalist arm that splits off.  
 At this year's general conference, which will be held May 5 to 15 in Minneapolis, the church will likely consider a split.  
 For Guillozet's congregants, the worry is about the future of family relationships with the United Methodist Church. For instance, whether a gay adult child will be able to marry a same-sex partner in the church. And Guillozet worries about the relationships she has in the church and whether they will remain collegial after a possible split.  
 Still, she knows her role.  
 "I'm here to make space for (LGBT worshipers)," Guillozet said. "I want people to be well and safe."  
 Linworth United Methodist is what's called a "reconciling congregation," meaning it accepts and affirms LGBT people, making it clear where the congregation would fall if a vote to split the denomination is taken in May, Guillozet said. She also would stay if the plan is approved, she said.  
 On Monday morning, Guillozet hosted a viewing of a livestream on a plan for how to split the denomination that the general conference delegates are likely to consider.  
 Afterwards, the 10 assembled congregants asked the young pastor lots of questions -- many of which she didn't know the answer as they concern decisions yet to be made on the denomination's future.  
 What does seem certain, though, is that Guillozet and other young pastors and seminarians will be integral in determining the future of the United Methodist Church.  
 On the MTSO campus in Delaware, the issue has united students and staff.  
 Transgender and gay pride flags were put on the lawn, banners on campus TV screens declared the school's acceptance of LGBT individuals and some cried tears of joy at a proclamation of acceptance last February by MTSO President Jay Rundell, following the denomination's decision to continue denying marriage and ministry to LGBT individuals.  
 Though the campus is home to students of all denominations, those who are Methodist have had to struggle with the uncertainty of whether the denomination that they have committed themselves to is willing to be accepting of all.  
 Megan Buehler, 34, of Berea in Cuyahoga County, is set to graduate with a master of divinity and counseling ministry in May. She wants to be a hospital chaplain and, though she said she briefly thought about leaving the denomination, she decided to stick it out.  
 "Only 50 years ago, women weren't able to be ordained," in the United Methodist Church, Buehler said. "That's not that long ago. That's why I'm staying. Lots of women I looked up to fought ... For me, leaving would be disrespectful to them."  
 She also desires to lead the church in a new direction: one of acceptance.  
 "I want to create a spot where everyone is able to have a voice," Buehler said. "I learned to use my voice at MTSO."  
 Rundell has worried that the 2019 decision by the denomination would chase young people like Guillozet and Buehler away from the church.  
 Rundell said he feels better about the future now, and that this new plan might be an answer to the division over LGBT issues.  
 ""I'm grateful people have been patient," he said.  
 Rundell is urging students to "hang in there through May."  
 "There'll be important work to do after almost 50 years of struggle," he said. "Anytime you come out of conflict, you have to find what you're going to commit to going forward …. I think they will see opportunity."

For the CDS, the major challenge will be to implement the five-year defence acquisition and two-year annual roll plan based on "anticipated budget." Without any financial commitment, defence planning will enter the realm of wishful planning. Unless this is grounded and realistic yardsticks are provided, the planning process will remain stymied. The second challenge is to integrate single-service plans into a synergised tri-service plan. Till joint theatre commands are introduced -- based on national security doctrine and national security strategy -- the CDS will at best be able to fine-tune services plans into an optimally effective joint plan. This should be done better than was done till today.

This profile is actually patented and the idea is it combines the best ride characteristics of 31.8 and 35mm, into a single package.

Anche la seconda edizione della Fiaccolata della Memoria patrocinata dal Comune di Avezzano si e conclusa nel modo sperato, nonostante si sia svolta in una giornata lavorativa.   Dopo la benedizione ricevuta al Santuario della Madonna di Pietraquaria, i tantissimi partecipanti hanno sfilato con le loro fiaccole lungo la strada, preceduti da una pattuglia della Polizia Locale che ringraziamo per l'indispensabile servizio svolto. Poi il lungo corteo ha proseguito sulla Via Crucis fino al Memorial.   Un ringraziamento particolare va agli amici Volontari della Croce Verde di Avezzano che hanno seguito i partecipanti, dapprima con un'ambulanza fino al piazzale e poi con una squadra a piedi lungo la Via Crucis, pronti a qualsiasi evenienza sanitaria.   Al Memorial la cerimonia si e svolta in modo composto e silenzioso tra momenti di grande commozione come durante la lettura del numero delle vittime paese per paese, invitando i presenti ad immaginare in quei numeri, nomi e volti di donne, uomini e bambini. Subito dopo sono stati doverosamente ricordati e pronunciati i nomi dei quattro ragazzi marsicani morti nel terremoto dell'Aquila del 2009, incisi su una lastra di marmo del monumento posto al Memorial, a loro dedicato nel decennale del terremoto nel 2019. Ospite d'Onore e stato Giovanbattista Pitoni, esemplare cittadino avezzanese, scrittore, storico, autore di opere teatrali, figlio di quell'Antonio Pitoni, superstite del terremoto della Marsica e autore della poesia simbolo che e "Mamma me" dedicata alla madre morta in quella circostanza, magistralmente interpretata ancora una volta da Giuseppe Ippoliti, attore avezzanese.   Al termine della cerimonia e stato offerto a tutti presenti un ristoro presso il gazebo organizzato dai Gruppi Alpini di Avezzano, San Pelino e Antrosano con dolci e bevande calde preparate sul posto. Onore infine proprio agli Alpini che hanno lavorato nei giorni precedenti per ripulire l'intera area del Memorial per consentire lo svolgimento delle manifestazioni ufficiali previste nella giornata del 13 gennaio.   Il Club Alpino Italiano Sezione di Avezzano, ringrazia quanti hanno partecipato arrivando anche dai comuni vicini. Vogliamo sottolineare anche la presenza di Ares, un bimbo diversamente abile che, sostenuto dalla mamma e da un'altra signora, ha percorso gioiosamente gli ultimi tratti del sentiero per poi assistere dalla sua sedia alla cerimonia.   Il nostro auspicio e che si possa ripetere ancora negli anni a venire questa rievocazione cosi sentita e partecipata percio il CAI di Avezzano rinnova l'appuntamento per la Fiaccolata della Memoria 2021.

When it comes to signing a sprinter, it's perhaps best not to overcomplicate things. At least, every time a berth opens for a finisher on the Deceuninck- QuickStep roster, the team's recruitment policy is straightforward: bring in the quickest man available.
 After a delay while he extricated himself from Bora-Hansgrohe, Sam Bennett arrives at a squad that has already won 10 bunch sprints in the past five Tours de France through four sprinters of differing characteristics. Mark Cavendish, Marcel Kittel, Fernando Gaviria and Elia Viviani all came, won and went, and now the Irish road race champion will be expected to fulfil the same brief.
 It puts one in mind of Juventus' transfer activity in the late 1990s, where a succession of centre forwards of varying styles - Vialli, Vieri, Inzaghi and Trezeguet - were successfully integrated into a team that looked as though it might carry on collecting titles regardless of who wore the number 9 shirt.
 Deceuninck-QuickStep directeur sportif Tom Steels, winner of nine Tour stages in his time as a rider, believes that Bennett offers the team something slightly different to the fast men who have gone before him.
 "The thing is with Sam is that he's less vulnerable, I think, on hard courses," Steels told _Cyclingnews_. "That's something that is a little bit new. If Cavendish was really good, he could climb quite well, but with Sam it's a completely different level. He really can climb, and if it's necessary he can really pass hard climbs, which means that you have more opportunities to control the race."
 There is a difference, however, between observing a sprinter on another team and working with him on a day-to-day basis. Steels and Deceuninck-QuickStep already have a firm idea of Bennett's physical capabilities, but the opening weeks of the season, starting with the Tour Down Under, are partly about figuring out how best to deploy them.
 "He can win on the flat and he can also win slightly uphill, but it's also a little bit of a discovery in the beginning of the year, to find the right match with the other riders," Steels said.  
 "It's also going to be a little bit new for him, I think, to get a lead-out that is going to be consistent, and to have a full team working for him. We need to get the consistency and then see how he goes. Does he win more if you really give him a lead-out to put him alone with 200 or 250m to go, or is it better to come a little bit more from the back and give him the room to accelerate from behind?"
 Unlike in football, where a striker might ordinarily be expected to adjust to his team's tactics, a freshly signed sprinter has rather more of a say in how his new squad should deliver him to the finish line. Over the years, Deceuninck-QuickStep's lead-out train has successfully adapted to service the explosivity of Cavendish and the power of Kittel, and it will be recalibrated once again in the first part of the campaign to suit Bennett's needs.
 Shane Archbold has followed Bennett from Bora-Hansgrohe to help smooth the transition, while the Irishman will be accompanied by Iljo Keisse and the team's master lead-out man Michael Mørkøv when he makes his debut for Deceuninck-QuickStep at the Tour Down Under.
 "Usually, you adapt to the sprinter because he's the guy who has to win," Steels said. "But what he asks for has to be logical. We have a lot of lead- out men who have already a few years' experience working with a sprinter, so, in the beginning, maybe the sprinter just says, 'You're the lead-out, you bring me there, and we'll see.' And then, step by step, you finetune it.
 "And, of course, it is up to Sam to find his way, to cope with the pressure and with the need to win. There is only one spot that counts for a sprinter; the second spot is not good enough. But he will manage."
 ## Tour de France
 After claiming his 13th and final win of 2019 with a long, long sprint at Oviedo on the Vuelta a España, Bennett noted that VO2 max testing had previously suggested he didn't possess the physiology of a pure sprinter.
 "But I just wanted to be a sprinter, so I probably forced myself to be something that I'm not," Bennett said.
 Then again, bike races don't take place in a vacuum. A young Cavendish, after all, was once almost rejected by the British Cycling Academy due to his performances on a stationary bike, and Steels has seen enough of Bennett's turn of pace to recognise his aptitude as a sprinter.
 "He still has that acceleration that you need to be a top sprinter," Steels said. "You see it mostly when he's been a little bit behind and then had to go. You see how fast he could recover the distance after being out of position, so he has the speed and the power to be at the top."
 As at Bora-Hansgrohe, where he had Pascal Ackermann and Peter Sagan for company, Bennett will have to divide the calendar with two other sprinters, even if it seems clear that he is number one on a depth chart that also includes Fabio Jakobsen and Alvaro Hodeg. Jakobsen, who beat Bennett in Madrid on the final day of the Vuelta, will be Deceuninck-QuickStep's sprinter at the Giro d'Italia, while Bennett has free rein at the Tour de France.
 It is all rather different to Steels' experience at Mapei in the 1990s, where he and Jan Svorada were both sent to the 1998 Tour. The experiment worked, in that Steels opened his account in Dublin on stage 1 and Svorada landed victory in Cork the next day, although it was not without its complications.
 "There was respect between us both, but we did many sprints where we said, 'You take left, I take right, and we'll see where we end up.' It wasn't an ideal situation, and I think, nowadays, it's a scenario that's very difficult to repeat," Steels said.
 "Now we have three top sprinters, and I think you cope by giving them a programme that allows them to maintain their value and win races. You also look at the race routes, and I think this year the Tour is quite hard for a sprinter - but not for a guy like Sam who will cope with it and get his opportunities."

ParisParis men's fashion week began Tuesday with the French capital in a grip of a 41-day transport strike that has already led to the cancellation of one show.The men's collections dovetail into the elite haute couture shows next week, with the French label Christophe Josse so hit by the chaos that it was forced to bow out. "We found ourselves unable to present our collection," the label said, because of the delays which strikes caused with their suppliers.As the elaborate haute couture creations are all made laboriously by hand in small workshops in and around Paris, the brand said it had no choice but to pull its show. The US label RR 331 had earlier given up its highly-coveted haute couture slot, although they denied that the French strikes had anything to do with their decision, saying "we will be back in Paris in July".With many models and fashionistas criss-crossing Paris several times a day by taxi or metro in normal circumstances, the French fashion federation has doubled the number of buses it is laying on between shows.Even so, with up to 12 shows a day in the official line-up and many more outside it, the gridlock on the city's streets is likely to be highly disruptive. A top stylist, who declined to be named, told AFP that the strikes were causing havoc in a industry where last-minute changes mean teams sometimes work around the clock to have clothes ready for the runway."Getting around has become a nightmare. It all adds to what is even in the best of times an extremely stressful situation," she added.Some of the temporary staff she hired for fashion weeks -- often from Italy, Spain and Belgium -- were reluctant to travel to the French capital to work given the rail disruption, she added.There were signs, however, Tuesday that the record-breaking strike over pension reforms may finally be easing.Despite the industrial action, Paris still dominates the fashion landscape, with the 53 official men's runway shows dwarfing Brexit-hit London, Milan and New York.Bowler hats Men's fashion week kicked off Tuesday evening with the edgy Chinese label Sankuanz's heavily punk-inspired show thick with "Kill the wall" slogans.American West Coast rappers were later out in force for the Paris debut of Rhude, the label founded by Philippines-born designer Rhuigi Villasenor.And Alexandre Mattiussi's Ami show brought the bowler hat back to the catwalk after a long absence in a co-ed show in a Paris theatre that was as romantic as the live accordion that accompanied it.The show began with taiko Japanese drumming, with Los Angeles-based Villasenor telling AFP that he was out to create clothes that are were practical and "timeless that will live through ages and trends".- Vuitton backwards clock -But the frenzied merry-go-round of shows and presentations begins in earnest Wednesday with big-hitters like JW Anderson, Raf Simons, Valentino and the hyperactive American Virgil Abloh.He will stage his own Off-White show 24 hours before he unveils his collection for Louis Vuitton, which he also designs.With his millions of followers, Abloh has already won the week's social media war by sharing images of a Louis Vuitton clock that ticks backward in a countdown to his show which he has sent out as an invitation to the event.He described it as a "literal piece of time" and fashionistas are already calling it a collector's item."The clock is rewired to spin backwards," he said. "There's a metaphor in that, but also, as they say, 'A broke clock is right twice a day'."As well as his two fashion shows, the architect-turned-artist-turned-designer is also opening his latest art/furniture show at the Kreo gallery in the French capital.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

 Aileen said: “My daughter only moved into the house in November and had spent a lot of time and money doing it up.
 “She had bought new furniture and everything has been destroyed. There are no beds for the boys, so they can’t stay there just now.
 “The light fittings have been completely destroyed, so she can’t even put the lights on.
 “She’s going to have to start from scratch and as a single mum it’s going to be very hard.
 “The damage caused is completely unbelievable,” she added.
 The incident sent shockwaves around the street, where some of the perpetrators are believed to live.

As the first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen Bipin Rawat has hit the ground running. He has been tasked with -- or is expected to achieve -- in three years what the country could not in 70. With all its fire and fury, the office of the CDS has finally arrived. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Government has fulfilled one more electoral pledge. The dispatch with which 40 bureaucrats are being sidestepped from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to its own newly-created Department of Military Affairs (DMA) is breath-taking. As a founder member of the Defence Planning Staff, which was revamped into the existing Integrated Defence Staff (IDS), I am familiar with the colossal teething problems and bottlenecks in creating a new institution in spite of the goodwill of the three Service Chiefs. In this instance, the civilian bureaucracy is relocating for the first time under a military head. Unique to India, the DMA will correct the aberration of the three Service headquarters being outliers. It will become integral to the MoD, thus facilitating, absent so far, the military's role in decision-making. Wisely, this re-location in MoD has mandated existing single-service structures; their charters should remain undisturbed.
