It turns out you may be showering incorrectly, or at least according to doctors that recently talked to The Daily Mail. According to the doctors a massive factor in showering correctly comes from how hot the water is, and if you are one of the potentially millions of people out there who love a near-boiling hot shower - you might want to stop doing that. The researchers say that its important to wash your face in lukewarm or almost cold water as hot water can dry out the skin on your face.Additionally, the researchers say that hot water can lead to short and long-term damage that includes broken or dilated blood vessels. On top of that, washing your face with hot water can strip your face from natural oils that are healthy for your skin. The experts recommend to save your face washing for when you are out of the shower, and make sure to rinse your face with a gentle cleanser.Hadley King, MD, told Marie Claire, 'Facial skin, like all skin, can become too dry if there is too much contact with water. Therefore, a general rule of thumb for showering is to make it not too long, not too hot, and not too frequent. If the warmth is limited to lukewarm, then risk of dilating capillaries is minimized.'If you are interested in more information about this story, check out this link here.

Applications for ballots by mail are due by the close of business on Oct. 23.
 Hunt County Elections Administrator Jose Martinez said there has been an unprecedented surge in people registering to vote.
 “It's been crazy,” Martinez said, noting his staff has been working non-stop catching up. He explained the office typically receives about 50 voter registration applications weekly.
 “The past few weeks, there have been around 400 when we get back to work each Monday,” Martinez said. “There’s been thousands.”
 Martinez is encouraging voters that it will be safe to cast their ballots. Early voting at the Fletcher Warren Civic Center will include COVID-19 protections and that there will be a phone number posted outside the site for those who do not wish to leave their vehicle.
 “We will go outside and come to you,” he said.
 Those wanting additional information can contact the Hunt County Elections Administration Office at 903-454-5467 or online at www.huntcounty.net/page/hunt.election or visit the Texas Secretary of State elections division website at www.votetexas.gov.

It matters how you interact with your virtual assistant, not because it has feelings or will one day murder you in your sleep for disrespecting it, but because of how it reflects on _you_. Alexa is not human, but we engage with her like one. We judge people by how they interact with retail and hospitality workers—it supposedly says a lot about a person that they are rude to wait staff. Of course, waiters are more deserving of respect than robots—you could make or break a worker’s mood with your thoughtlessness, while Alexa doesn’t _have_ moods (she only cares about yours). But the underlying revelation is the same: Who are you when in a position of power, and how do you treat those beneath you?

"I calciatori e gli addetti a lavoro devono prendere le giuste precauzioni ma tanti di noi hanno figli che vanno a scuola. Io quando torno a scuola i miei figli li bacio, loro hanno 15 e 17 anni, escono e non sai cosa fanno. Se si vuole portare a termine il campionato l'estrema soluzione è chiuderci in una bolla come l'NBA. Siamo professionisti, amiamo quello che facciamo. A noi manca il calcio con il pubblico, quello vero, ma oggi questo è quello che si può fare, anche andare in ritiro forzato a tempo indeterminato, se serve per continuare va bene. I protocolli vanno bene, secondo me i controlli devono essere 2 a settimana, anche se è un peso a livello economico. I protocolli vanno bene, lo scorso anno abbiamo portato a termine il campionato. Non è tanto il protocollo ma è capire come andrà la soluzione".

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Grants offered by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's nonprofit organization to run elections during the coronavirus pandemic have drawn the ire of Attorney General Jeff Landry and are prompting efforts to rewrite Louisiana law. After Landry learned of the grant offer, the Republican official warned local election officials — registrars of voters, clerks of court and others — not to pursue the money. He's working with state House GOP leader Blake Miguez to outlaw the ability for Louisiana officials to use such grants for elections. And Landry is asking a court to declare the arrangement illegal under current law. The Advocate reports the nonprofit handing out the money across the nation, the Center for Tech and Civic Life, said 26 election officials across Louisiana applied for grants, with a total potential amount of about $7.8 million. Now, all those applications have been withdrawn after Landry’s intervention. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, the state’s Republican chief elections official, urged locals to apply for the grants after discovering the opportunity. But he's since sided with Landry and is backing Miguez's bill to ban the practice. “When we realized there were potential ethical issues with accepting the grant money, we consulted with the attorney general and subsequently advised clerks to reject any grant money awards,” Ardoin said. The legislation awaits debate before the full House, after receiving support from the House and Governmental Affairs Committee on a 7-5 vote. The committee hearing was contentious, likely a preview of a heated debate on the House floor. Landry’s office said the legislation would clarify that private contributions for elections are not legal, while Democrats argued it would create new...

NACIONES UNIDAS (AP) — Un nuevo reporte calcula que 29 millones de mujeres y niñas son víctimas de la esclavitud moderna, explotadas mediante prácticas que incluyen trabajo forzado, matrimonio forzado, servidumbre doméstica y cautiverio por deudas. Grace Forrest, cofundadora de la organización antiesclavitud Walk Free, dijo el viernes que eso significa que una de cada 130 mujeres y niñas vive en esclavitud moderna. “La realidad es que hay más personas viviendo en esclavitud hoy que en ningún momento en la historia”, dijo Forrest en una conferencia de la ONU. Walk Free define la esclavitud moderna “como la eliminación sistemática de la libertad de una persona, en la que la persona es explotada por otra por ganancia personal o financiera”, dijo. Forrest dijo que el cálculo global de una de cada 130 mujeres y niñas viviendo en esclavitud moderna se basa en un trabajo de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo y la Organización Internacional para Migración, ambas agencias de la ONU, y de Walk Free. “Lo que muestra este reporte es que el género inclina las probabilidades en contra de las mujeres, desde su concepción y durante toda su vida”, dijo. De acuerdo con el reporte, las mujeres representan 99% de todas las víctimas de explotación sexual forzada, 84% de todas las víctimas de matrimonios forzados y 58% de todas las víctimas de trabajos forzados. Forrest dijo que el rostro de la esclavitud moderna “ha cambiado radicalmente”. “Estamos viendo una explotación normalizada en nuestra economía en las cadenas transnacionales de suministros y también en los senderos de migración”, dijo. “Las personas más vulnerables del mundo están siendo empujadas aún más a esa práctica de esclavitud moderna debido al COVID-19”. . ..

The state Fish and Game Department says this is the busiest weekend of the fall hiking season for both expert trekkers and casual leaf peepers. With a surge of hikers of all skill levels hitting the trail, they're warning visitors to be careful and responsible, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials say hikers should maintain safe social distancing and wear masks when that's not possible. They advise hikers to think twice about dangerous backcountry adventures given that rescues put first responders at greater risk of exposure to the virus.

"Cooperatives exist to serve the communities that own them, not enrich faraway corporate shareholders," stated Jacqueline Hannah Reid, FCI's assistant director, in the release. "That mission -- and the fact that local residents own the business they're supporting -- builds community and builds loyalty. It's just one reason why co-ops are so successful."
 The co-op will be open to everyone, regardless of whether they become owners. The store will accept SNAP benefits and offer a Healthy Food Access program, which gives an additional 10% discount to low-income owners.
 There are benefits to purchasing a one-time $200 share, including an annual dividend in profitable years; a say in the co-op's products and classes; bulk ordering discounts; and voting rights for store initiatives and board elections.
 Mitchell said members will also receive special coupons and there will be member appreciation days.
 The capital campaign gives owners the opportunity to make interest-bearing loans to the co-op. Bank financing and grants will also be used to pay for the approximately $4.6 million project.
 Thriving during a pandemic
 More than 70% of startup food co-ops are still in business five years after opening and two-thirds of established food co-ops have been around more than 30 years, according to FCI.

PRAGUE (AP) — Opposition parties in the Czech Republic have cemented their dominant position in Parliament’s upper house after winning big in an election for a third of the seats in the Senate, as the ruling center- left coalition government suffered a setback. With nearly all the votes counted Saturday by the Statistics Office, the mostly center-right opposition parties won 26 of the 27 seats up for grabs in the 81-seat Senate in the two- round election. The senior governing party — the centrist ANO (YES) party led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis — won only one seat. Its coalition partner, the left-wing Social Democrats, won none of the 10 seats they were defending. Their minority government is supported in Parliament’s lower house by far-left Communists who have no seat in the Senate. The lower house dominates the legislative process, but the Senate plays an important role in passing constitutional amendments and approving Constitutional Court judges. A grouping of mayors and independent candidates won 11 seats, followed by the conservative Civic Democratic Party with five and the Christian Democrats with three. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, face masks were required at voting places. Quarantined voters had the option of casting ballots from vehicles at temporary polling stations across the country. Those who were unable to use a car or venture out could ask a special electoral committee to send a ballot box to their homes. Before the coronavirus pandemic, quarantined voters were not allowed to cast ballots, although their numbers were relatively low. The Czech Republic, population 10.7 million, is seeing a record surge in new confirmed virus cases. Their number hit 8,618 on Friday, a new record for the fourth straight day. The country has a total of almost...
