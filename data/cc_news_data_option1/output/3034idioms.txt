The heated primary is playing out in a city already wrestling with racial divisions and political identity. Melton-Meaux has drawn support from some traditional Democrats uncomfortable with Omar's style -- highlighting a generation gap that has dogged Democrats this year. He's raised big money from pro-Israel groups with strong support in the city's first-ring suburbs. And his bid has prompted a fight for votes in the Black and Somali-American communities, each roiled by this summer's uprising over George Floyd's death.
