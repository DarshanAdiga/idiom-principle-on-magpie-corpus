Please take care in selecting your destination. We suggest sites close to home. This could reduce the chance that COVID-19 could spread to unimpacted communities, or accidentally bringing it back to your community. Now is the perfect time to discover your local recreation sites. With some research, you may also be able to find less used trails, waters and recreation areas that are off the beaten path and less likely to attract crowds.
 Check before lighting a campfire, as the COVID-19 situation has increased firefighting complexity and some burns bans are already in place.
 Enjoy day trips, as all camping on state lands is still closed. Fill your cooler and gas tank before leaving your neighborhood, and plan to be back home before needing more supplies.
 And, before heading out, it’s best to confirm that your intended destination is open. Many sites, whether local, tribal, or federal, particularly those where maintaining proper physical distancing could be difficult, remain closed. Please respect these closures.
 Finally, if you pack it in, pack it out. Trash cans may be available – but don’t use them. If you are able, take that trash home with you. With more visitors and fewer maintenance staff, we’re asking you to lead by example here too. Restrooms offer a special challenge; they may not currently be open or meet typical cleanliness levels due to high use and limited staff. There are many options for safely managing your own human waste and, if necessary, you should be prepared to do so. Piles of garbage, or worse, may put that site in jeopardy of being shut down, not because of COVID-19, but for unsanitary conditions. Nobody wants that.
 If you, we, and all of us, act as leaders in our communities and embrace these changes to recreating in the outdoors, we begin to create the norms that can ensure safe and ongoing access to public lands and outdoor recreation for everyone.
 It’s a whole new world out there, so please, Washington, practice responsible recreation as you go back to the wild.

VANGAALEN, Gerry October 21, 1932 - May 9, 2020 Gerry put a peaceful end to his battle with pancreatic cancer. He was surrounded by his loving family and great friends at his passing. His focus was crystal clear and his manner was calm yet determined. Gerrys rich life began in Heeze, Netherlands. Immigrating to Canada in 1957, Gerry settled in Chateauguay, Quebec where he met Betty and started his family before moving to BC in 1967. Finding Delta, BC to be so similar to his homeland, he set down his roots. Gerrys family and many friends will remember a strong yet generous and caring spirit who enriched their lives and they enriched his. Gerry is survived by his wife Betty Sr., daughter Betty Jr. (John), son Garry, son Bill (Barbara), grandchildren Josh (Kim), Ryan (Tami) and Matt (Jessica) as well as great grandchildren Braydon, Andrew and Saskia, and his adopted children daughter Maribel and son Rene.

Va subito detto che non si tratta di uno studio a doppio braccio, cioè comparativo e randomizzato, di quelli in cui si confronta l'efficacia di un medicinale attraverso due gruppi di pazienti, uno che lo prende e l'altro che non lo prende, dopo essere stati selezionati casualmente. Per questo i risultati aspettano una conferma da un'altra ricerca, sempre autorizzata da Aifa. “Lo studio clinico non comparativo su tocilizumab è stato realizzato in condizioni di emergenza, in un contesto di elevate aspettative e assenza di trattamenti efficaci”, dicono dall'Agenzia. In questo caso per motivi etici il farmaco è stato dato a tutti coloro che ne avevano bisogno. “I risultati suggeriscono una moderata riduzione della mortalità”, è la conclusione. In particolari si osservano più effetti positivi sulla mortalità a 30 giorni. I risultati “statisticamente significativi, dicono che la letalità dopo un mese tra i pazienti che hanno preso il tocilizumab è stata del 22,4%, contro quella, ipotizzata a priori in base ai dati dell'Istituto superiore di sanità proprio perché non esisteva un gruppo di controllo che non ha utilizzato il medicinale, del 30%. A 14 giorni invece i valori sono meno significativi, perché chi ha assunto il medicinale ha avuto una mortalità del 18,4% contro il 20% atteso sempre in base ai dati dell'Istituto. Non è abbastanza per rivelare una qualche utilità.

He said that these standards have been formulated in accordance with international standard specifications. Addressing the media briefing the Director-General of the SL Standards Institute Dr. (Mrs) Siddhika Senaratne said that this is an opportune moment to market these products internationally, but it should be done in accordance with proper standards.

Perhaps it is newcomer's nerves, but his voice does take on a certain John Major tone, or should that be drone, at times. If the Commons chamber ever gets back to its usual packed state at PMQs he could struggle to be heard. In general, he is a man not overburdened with charisma.

WATERMAEL-BOITSFORT, Belgium (AP) — Something he saw as he drove to work one morning gave Tristan Van den Bosch an uplifting idea. “I saw a man shouting at his mother,” said Van den Bosch. Not unusual — except that the man was on the ground and his mother was three stories up. She was, like many seniors, locked down in a care home to avoid the COVID-19 virus. But as days have turned to weeks and months, families like this one have struggled. “We can help this man!” Van den Bosch thought. As operations manager at Group-f, a cleaning and maintenance company, Van der Bosch had a problem. The pandemic had reduced business to a trickle, leaving many of his cranes standing idle in the depot. Why not use those cranes to lift people, so they can see relatives on the upper floors of homes for the aged? Since then, Van den Bosch has been driving his cranes to homes in several towns across Belgium. A platform carries families to their relatives’ windows. A daughter or grandson waves, and worries vanish from faces creased by age. No internet connection does as well. Eve Putseys didn’t quite know what to expect as she was lifted up to see her 88-year-old aunt, Suzanne, at the La Cambre care home on the outskirts of Brussels. “It’s been seven long weeks since I haven’t been able to see her,” she said. “It’s all quite emotional.” Afterward, Putseys was all smiles. “I got to see her -- and that was great,” she said. And on top of that “she looked very happy to see me.” The anxiety of families with relatives in nursing homes is well placed; of the 8,843 confirmed and suspected cases who had died of the virus in Belgium as of Tuesday, 4,538 were in such facilities. Their families are left feeling helpless, fearing they will not see each other...
