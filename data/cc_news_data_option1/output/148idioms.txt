 Jack Harrison was the star of the first half, but when a deep free-kick picked him out in the 19th minute, he touched it wide. His shot approaching the half- hour was much better, but Dawson met it with a low stretching save.

Germany’s Siemens has decided to stand by a contract linked to a coal mine in Australia that climate activists had called for it to drop.
 The German industrial conglomerate’s CEO, Joe Kaeser, had promised to review Siemens’ involvement in the project in light of climate activists’ opposition. But in a statement late Sunday, Kaeser said that “there is practically no legally and economically responsible way to unwind the contract without neglecting fiduciary duties.”
 Siemens on Dec. 10 signed the contract to supply signaling systems for a rail link between the Carmichael coal mine and a port. The vast mine is owned by Indian company Adani, and the contract is worth about 18 million euros ($20 million) to Siemens.
 Kaeser wrote that there were competitors — “thus, whether or not Siemens provides the signaling, the project will still go ahead.”

 “(As a defenseman) it’s more of a game of you go when you can, but you have to be responsible defensively. You have to learn to read and when to jump up in the play,” Howe said. “As a forward, you’re learning at key points of the game: ‘When do you try to make a play? When is it a smart play to dump the puck in the corner? When you definitely not want to turn a puck over?’ And with both (positions), you take different chances.”
 While Pysyk hadn’t played defense since he was 6 or 7 until earlier this season, Quinn knew from recruiting Smith to Boston University that this dual role was possible. Quinn asked Smith last season to try it, and it worked so well that it has stuck, with Smith also killing penalties as a defenseman.

How poignant would it be if that British team-mate were Jonny; a bronze- medallist behind Alistair in London, and silver medallist four years later. Forever in his brother’s shadows, how thrilling if that final Brownlee chapter saw Alistair sacrificing himself on the front of the bunch to put Jonny into position for gold?
 That would be some book-end to a fabulous career.
 Not that this one last hurrah in Olympic competition will be the last we see of him. Just hours after the announcement of him contesting the triathlon, came news that Alistair had been nominated by the British Olympic Association as a candidate for the International Olympic Committee’s Athletes’ Commission.
 Brownlee is one of 30 candidates who will face a vote of their fellow athletes at Tokyo 2020 for the duration of the Games in July and August. If successful, Brownlee will act as an athlete representative during high-profile IOC forums.
 The 31-year-old said: “It is an enormous honour to be nominated. As a 17-year- old schoolboy, I vividly recall being told by the headmaster that London had won the bid to hold the 2012 Olympic Games.
 “Since then the inspirational effect of the Games has given me two of the best days of my life and over a decade competing in the sport I love.
 “I feel I am a true product of the Olympic movement and would relish the opportunity to repay my gratitude by helping and representing other athletes.”
 Get him on that council. There is no better role model for British sport, and no better ambassador to represent the interests of the athletes in these difficult times for the sport.
 Could this be the start of a Seb Coe-type move into sports administartion? There are few brighter minds.
 One for the future, but for now let us enjoy one last ride with Alistair Brownlee.

 Like Rodgers, Chiefs coach Andy Reid had a Hall of Fame-worthy resume. Unlike Rodgers, Reid has no Lombardi Trophy on his mantle.
 Indeed, few coaches have been so successful in more than one location — Marty Schottenheimer and Dan Reeves come to mind — without owning a ring. Reid got to the 2005 Super Bowl, where his Eagles lost a close one to New England.
 He’s unquestionably the most accomplished of the four remaining coaches, though Tennessee’s Mike Vrabel has three rings as a player. Reid, 12-14 in the postseason, has the kind of roster capable of going all the way. Can he guide it there?

By Busani Bafana
 BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe, Jan 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a child, Kenyan meteorologist Saumu Shaka helped out on her parents' small farm growing maize and pigeon pea - and learned how the weather can hold food producers hostage.
 "Looking back, the yield has declined over the years," said Shaka, 28, who works with the Kenya Meteorological Department.
 A decade ago, her parents would get 25 sacks of maize from their six hectares in Taita Taveta County, southeast of Nairobi.
 Today that has dwindled to five bags at most, because of erratic rainfall that can also spur crop-destroying pests.
 As climate change fuels extreme weather and threatens harvests, Africa needs more scientific expertise to help small-scale farmers adapt, especially women who tend to be hit worst, said Wanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg, director of Nairobi- based group African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD).
 According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), women represent nearly half of farmers in Africa and produce up to 80% of basic food crops.
 They are also largely responsible for preparing, storing and processing food.
 But in many cases, the FAO says, they have limited rights, mobility and access to resources, information and decision-making power, making them more vulnerable and less able to adapt to climate change impacts than men.
 "This means women's continued underrepresentation in climate change research is no longer acceptable," said Kamau-Rutenberg, noting that few have opportunities in science education.
 AWARD is leading the One Planet Fellowship, a new initiative that will train 630 African and European scientists to use a gender lens to help African smallholders adapt to climate shifts, unusually offering Africans the opportunity to serve as mentors.
 Under-investment in African scientific research capacity means "we still don't even know the specific ways climate change will manifest … in Africa," said Kamau-Rutenberg.
 In September, the three-year career development program welcomed its first cohort of 45 fellows from Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, Zambia, Malawi, Benin, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Togo, Mali, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso - over half of them female.
 The aim is to "set an example and dispel the myth that there are no African women scientists ready to step into leadership", Kamau-Rutenberg added.
 AWARD collaborates on the initiative, worth nearly $20 million, with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, France's BNP Paribas Foundation and Agropolis Fondation, the European Union and Canada's International Development Research Centre.
 'FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE'
 As one of the inaugural fellows, Shaka is seeking home-grown solutions to the challenges faced by farmers like her parents, who are battling to grow enough food on a warming planet.
 Her research focuses on cost-effective "climate-smart" agribusiness techniques to help young people boost jobs and food security, which she will promote on social media platforms.
 African scientists "have firsthand experience and solutions that are practical and applicable to their societal set-ups within their individual countries", she said.
 Women scientists, moreover, are better able to understand the specific challenges in designing community-tailored solutions to help fellow women, said the senior meteorologist.
 Droughts and floods, for example, impose a health burden on women, who have to walk long distances in search of water and stay alert to the risk of waterborne diseases, she noted.
 Pamela Afokpe, 27, an AWARD fellow from Benin, said "in-continent" experts could relate to the needs of African farmers more easily.
 Afokpe, a vegetable breeder with East-West Seed International, is working to get more farmers growing indigenous leafy vegetables in West and Central Africa by helping them access high-yielding varieties resistant to pests and diseases.
 Up to now, a limited number of African experts have contributed to the landmark scientific assessments published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which synthesizes research and guides policymakers.
 Out of 91 lead authors of the 2018 IPCC special report on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, only eight were from Africa, as were just a tenth of the 783 contributing authors.
 South Africa's Debra Roberts, co-chair of a working group for the IPCC ongoing sixth scientific assessment report and the first female co-chair from Africa, said the panel's work showed tackling climate change required all of society to respond.
 "Women have different lived experiences and views on the problems and solutions," she said.
 "We need to hear those voices if we are to be able to identify context- relevant solutions from the scientific literature. There is no one-size-fits- all," she added.
 Over the IPCC's three decades of operation, there have only been three female co-chairs, two of them on the current report, she noted. "We have a long way to go still," Roberts told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview.
 ENERGY PRIORITIES
 Women also need to be involved in the practical design of climate solutions, such as expanding off-grid solar power and clean cooking, which can reduce drudgery and minimize health issues linked pollution, said agricultural experts.
 As forest loss and climate change make resources scarcer, women have to go longer distances to gather fuel-wood, which puts additional pressure on their time, health and personal security, said Katrin Glatzel, a research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Dakar, Senegal.
 In Mali, a public-private partnership has provided 1.6 million people with more efficient stoves, reducing pollution by half compared to a traditional three-stone fire, she noted.
 Glatzel said it was important to include and empower female scientists and farmers in the switch to cleaner, modern energy, so that their concerns could be addressed.
 A 2019 survey by charity Practical Action in rural Togo found women prioritized energy for pumping drinking water and processing crops, while men favored mobile-phone charging and heating water for washing, she noted.
 In northern Benin, meanwhile, a solar-powered drip irrigation system means a cooperative of 45 women now fetches water one or twice a week rather than daily, she added.
 Bringing women on board with technological innovation for rural energy services is key "to ensure that end products meet their needs and those of their families", she said.

 “We did well against Arsenal (in their FA Cup third-round defeat) and we have played like that before against a Championship side but it (the attention) is not as big because it’s not against a big side.”
 Ability is not an issue for Leeds, but missed chances are. They need a replacement for Eddie Nketiah – recalled from his season-long loan by Arsenal – as soon as possible. “Patrick (Bamford) is an unbelievable goal-scorer so there’s no worry there,” insisted White, himself on loan from Brighton. “Our aim is to just take every game as it comes and just pick up as many points as we can until the end of the season.”

The consumption of sweet potato is increasing as it offers various health advantages. The food and beverage companies located in North America and Europe have developed innovative sweet potato products having a great combination of taste and nutrition. The food and beverage producers are continuously trying to bring in more innovative products with familiar ingredients to gain traction among health-conscious consumers. The primary concern for North America and Europe is the shortage in the production of sweet potato. The low pricing is one of the main reason for the small production of sweet potato in North America. Uncertain climatic conditions is another reason that has attributed to the low production of sweet potatoes in North America and Egypt. The recent hurricanes and heavy rainfalls in 2018 in the US had been a significant factor that destroyed the total sweet potatoes cultivated in that season. There has been an increasing demand for sweet potatoes in North America that has created a vast opportunity for the farmers in the Middle East and Africa to export their crop to this region.

DHAHRAN -- Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, will work for oil market stability at a time of heightened U.S.-Iranian tension and wants to see sustainable prices and demand growth, the kingdom's energy minister said on Monday.
 Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said it was too early to talk about whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, would continue with production curbs agreed under a deal that expires in March.
 "As tension remains high in our region, Saudi Arabia will continue to do all it can do to ensure stable oil markets," the minister told an energy conference.
 "We would like to have a stable oil market, sustainable growth in terms of demand, sustainable growth in terms of supply," he said, adding that both high and low prices were undesirable. "The worst thing is to have low oil prices that permanently damage industry."
 Oil prices held steady on Monday as the United States and Iran appeared to retreat from the brink of full blown confrontation after a U.S. drone strike killed an Iranian commander on Jan. 3 and Iran retaliated with missiles launched against U.S. bases in Iraq.
 Prince Abdulaziz said the United States was a strategic partner with a big role in international security. "We're leaving it to our friends in the U.S. to conduct themselves in the manner they see fit," he said.
 The kingdom, the world's top oil exporter that witnessed an assault on its oil facilities last September that temporarily halved output, was the most "reliable and responsible supplier" of crude, the minister said.
 Washington and Riyadh blamed Iran for the Sept. 14 missile and drone attacks on Saudi oil plants, a charge Tehran denied. (Reporting by Rania El Gamal and Marwa Rashad in Dhahran and Maher Chmaytelli in Dubai; Writing by Ghaida Ghantous; editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)

BEIRUT -- Over the past year, the former chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi was jailed, then muzzled. Now that he's free, Carlos Ghosn is threatening to go after the parties that accused him of crimes and stripped him of his corporate positions.
 Ghosn, on the lam in Lebanon after jumping bail in Japan, will explore "massive" countermeasures against those he says have wronged him, said his French lawyer Francois Zimeray.
 Zimeray didn't rule out any actions. Possible moves could involve civil suits or other complaints, in Japan or elsewhere, and are precedented by a case filed last year by Ghosn in the Netherlands.
 "There are many actions to launch now," Zimeray told _Automotive News_ last week after Ghosn gave a combative press conference here -- his first with the media since his November 2018 arrest in Tokyo.
 "This paves the way for a counterattack, which will be legitimate and massive," said Zimeray, in attendance at the event in Beirut. Ghosn fled to Lebanon in a coordinated, cloak-and-dagger getaway at the end of December to escape what he calls injustice and political persecution in Japan.
 Ghosn had been awaiting trial in Tokyo on charges of financial misconduct and faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
 Zimeray said Ghosn's legal team has not decided what measures to take or whom they will target. But, he said, "We are ready to go further now and hit."
 At the press conference, Ghosn said clearing his name and reestablishing his reputation were the top priorities, even if that meant standing trial in another jurisdiction. Ghosn said he would face a court in any country except Japan, which he said has a rigged justice system.
 "I can do a lot, and I want to clear my name," Ghosn said. "You can expect me in the next weeks to take some initiatives."

Since my mother’s admission, we have become very familiar with the overall plight of nursing homes in Massachusetts, how these facilities cannot find or keep staff because they cannot pay them a living wage and those who do stay have to work a second or third job to make ends meet.

 Johnson can’t be blamed for players not being able to pass the ball five yards or for not making a tackle but fundamentally the buck stops with him and he sets up the formation and how he wants to play.
