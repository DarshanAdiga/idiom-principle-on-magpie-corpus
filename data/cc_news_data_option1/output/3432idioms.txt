That's on top of CDC- recommended guidelines that include social distancing, wearing masks and frequent hand-washing.

Most of the victims in Saturday's attack apparently did not know each other and were traveling on six motorcycles, some in tandems, when they were blocked by six to eight gunmen and ordered to alight. After getting off their motorcycles in the middle of the road, they were shot at least 39 times with rifles and pistols, police investigator Delir Parcon said by phone.

He had never heard of Hawaii's Pearl Harbor until Dec. 7, 1941, when he learned from the radio about the attack there. Soon after, anyone of Japanese descent was restricted in when and where they could go. While en route to a night class, he was stopped by a police officer who asked where he was going, looked at his ID and told him he wasn’t supposed to be wandering around after curfew.
 He joined a group of volunteers on their way to Pinedale, an incarceration camp near Fresno, California, that the government had framed as a relocation center for Japanese Americans. Edy Horikawa and the other volunteers set up the detention center before others arrived.
 “I thought it was a great adventure,” he said in a wide-ranging interview about his life in 2001 conducted by the Go For Broke Education Center. “I was just a worker at a grocery store, not a glamorous job at all. I had nothing to lose, everything to gain. America was my country, my father always put that in my head. You obey your president.”
 Edy Horikawa witnessed the Japanese Americans’ mistreatment. Everyone had to dump out their suitcases on sand, then walk 1½ miles to the barracks. Some families had cotton mattresses, others got straw. He was then forced to move to Tule Lake, another incarceration camp in California. Norigiku Horikawa said her husband told her that he didn’t have any relatives with him, so he had to live in the barracks with another family.
 Incarcerated Japanese American adults were asked to answer questions that became known colloquially as the "loyalty questionnaire." At Tule Lake he was asked if he would swear allegiance to the U.S. and if he would join the military. Edy Horikawa said yes to both. He was sent to Army bases around the U.S., then got the call that he would be sent to Europe.
 Before he left, he was able to visit his family members who had been forced to move to Minidoka, an incarceration camp in Idaho. His uncle — who helped raise him and his siblings after the death of their father, then their mother — caught a salmon for dinner and told him to be loyal to the U.S., be a good soldier and come back alive. That last part was hard to do, he joked in the 2001 interview.

Further, the Soviet Union loomed larger than life during the 1971 Bangladesh operations. This warranted the appearance of the US 7th fleet in the Bay of Bengal. There was corresponding interplay within. Powerful Congress party bosses discarded by Indira Gandhi in 1969 linked up with Socialists, viscerally anti Communist, and the RSS -- this was the amalgamation which became the Bihar or JP movement of 1974. It eventually led to the Emergency and the first non-Congress government in 1977.

Lionel Messi has not reported for required coronavirus testing that was scheduled for the whole squad. It's another sign that his time with Barcelona is coming to an end.
 Barcelona said Messi was the only player who did not undergo the tests at the club's training centre. The team is set to resume training on Monday ahead of the upcoming start of the season.
 The club also reiterated its stance not to negotiate Messi's early release, saying president Josep Bartomeu will only sit down with the player if it is to extend his contract beyond next season.
 Messi last week expressed his desire to leave the club, but Barcelona wants him to play out the contract that ends in June 2021. The club also said it is not negotiating a possible transfer with any other team.
 Messi announced his decision to leave on Tuesday by sending the club a burofax, a certified document similar to a telegram.
 He invoked a contract clause that allowed him to leave at the end of the season for free, but the club claims that the clause had already expired.
 A legal battle is expected to unfold as Messi will contend that the season was extended beyond the date the clause expired because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Argentina great reportedly said he wanted to negotiate with the club, but Barcelona said it was not willing to facilitate his exit. The club said it would like for Messi to finish his career with the Catalan club.

Journalist and author Syed Ubaidur Rahman in his book “Ulema’s Role in India’s Freedom Movements” writes that Maulana Mahmud Hasan, Maulana Aziz Gul Peshawari, Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madani, Maulana Wahid Ahmad Madani and Hakim Nusrat were made to spend more than three years in inhuman conditions at an old fort on a hill in Malta. Since there was no case against Hakim Nusrat Hussain as he happened to be in Makkah for Hajj and had joined his teacher Mahmud Hasan when they were arrested, the jail officials repeatedly offered to release Hakim  _sahab_. “But on every occasion he refused, telling his captors that he would not leave the prison while his teacher was behind bars,” writes Rahman. Hakim Sahab fell ill and died in Malta.

Taylor and Not This Time have been contracted by the City of Seattle’s Department of Neighborhoods to consult on community-building and outreach. Taylor, who used the term “street czar” to describe his role, said he retains an independent voice and that the relationship is no different than that of other community organizations receiving city grants.
 He and his organization led the passage of Initiative 940, a statewide measure that removed a legal barrier law that made it virtually impossible to bring charges against police officers believed to have wrongfully used deadly force. In the first case under the new standard, the King County Prosecutor’s Office earlier this month charged Jeffrey Nelson, an Auburn police officer, with second-degree murder and first-degree assault for the May 2019 fatal shooting of 26-year-old Jesse Sarey.
 “When you bring people together, you build power and you can force what you want legislatively,” Taylor said. “We proved bringing people together works, and we’ve proved the legislation works as well. The protest of agitation — what has that produced? It hasn’t produced anything but violence, separation.”
 For others on the ground, there is validity in a variety of tactics.
 “You can’t tell a Black person how to grieve,” said Katie N., an organizer with the Morning March. “Personally, it’s not my route, but ‘by any means necessary’ to me means any means. All lanes are occupied.”
 The Morning March has stopped traffic, including on the Ballard Bridge, marched through neighborhoods and downtown, organized trash pickups and protested inside a grocery store. Varying the tactics can improve safety and make a bigger impact, Katie said.
 “When you do the same thing over and over again,” she said, “you kind of get the same results over and over again.”

Dear Dave,
 My in-laws have very generously offered my wife and me $250,000 to help with a down payment on a home. I know the amount exceeds the IRS's yearly gift allowance, but they want to structure it as a family loan and have already told us they don't care if we pay it back. If we accept, we technically owe them a lot of money. If we say no, they may be offended. What do you think about this and how it might impact the relationship?
 James
 Dear James,
 Well, it makes sense your wife would be on board with the whole thing. It's her dad making the offer, so of course, she would be a lot more comfortable with the idea than you are.
 This is a big deal, and it's something you two should have a very serious conversation about. Get on the same page in every regard. Also, I'd recommend making sure you get everything in writing. See to it, as well, that it can be forgiven at the maximum allowable annual gift rate.
 In addition, in the event of death, make sure it's included in the estate, it's forgiven and there will be zero call on the note. In effect, that would make it an advance on your inheritance instead of debt. Under no circumstances should they, or any other heirs, have grounds to call the note.
 That's a good question, James. And a nice gift!
 Dave
 Dear Dave,
 I have a full-time job, but I also have a side job providing firewood to help pay off debt. I make $600 to $1,000 a month with this project. My log splitter went down recently when a hydraulic line burst and the machine caught on fire. I'm not sure how much it will cost to get it going again. Should I invest in a new one that will increase my productivity and help me pay off debt faster?
 Chris
 Dear Chris,
 If I'm in your shoes, I'm going to fix the old one. Even if it means duct tape and glue, I'm going to try to find a way to repair it instead of spending a bunch of money or going deeper into debt.
 If you can't do that at a reasonable price out of pocket, I'd be in the market for a decent, used log splitter. And pay cash! I get your line of thinking when it comes to increasing productivity. Splitting wood is real work. But don't try to justify buying an expensive, new piece of equipment when it's just not necessary.
 If you're making that much with a side hustle, you can make your money back on a used splitter in a month or two - three at the most. Be smart about it, Chris!
