MOSCOW — In Russia, there are no daily public displays of gratitude for its doctors as there are in the West during the coronavirus crisis.            Instead, Russian medical workers face mistrust, low pay and even hostility.            The COVID-19 outbreak has put enormous pressure on them, and they say they are battling both the virus and a system that fails to support them.            Doctors who try to speak out about a lack of protective equipment and dire working conditions face intimidation, are accused of lying, and some are being fired or even face prosecution.            Officials and news reports also say more than 9,400 medical workers have gotten the virus in the past month, and more than 70 have died.            ---            COVID-19 in entertainment ...            The Stratford Festival says despite efforts to rescue its finances from the impact of COVID-19 the organization still has a $20-million hole in its budget.            Carol Stephenson, chairwoman of the board at the festival, has asked the House of Commons standing committee on finance for $8 million to help get the arts organization back on its feet.            She says the rest of the shortfall can be raised through donations from the private sector.            Stratford was to roll out 15 productions in four theatres, including Colm Feore's "Richard III'' as the inaugural show at the new $70-million Tom Patterson Theatre, before the closure of its theatres in March.            ---            COVID-19 in sports ...            Jason Dorrington was looking forward to playing for six softball teams this summer, until recreational sports across the country ground to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic.            Individual, non-contact sports like golf and tennis have been given the green light to play in Quebec and Ontario this week. However, team sports such as soccer, baseball, basketball and flag football, must wait until they have been deemed safe to play by their respective governments.            "It sucks," Dorrington said. "I look forward to it every year to get together with the boys all the time. I play five, six times a week. Gives me something to do."            For organizations like AK-Rec, a Montreal basketball recreational league with nearly 800 participants through nine recreational divisions in gyms across the city, they've already cancelled their summer leagues and it is possible they may not see any action until early January 2021.            "It's gone from a healthy revenue stream to zero," says AK-Rec owner and founder Ariel Kincler.            The issue of contact, or lack thereof, may pose a challenge for some recreation leagues once they return.            John Stellato, president and director of the Quebec Calcetto Soccer League, feels it might not be possible to have participants follow every physical distancing measure as they play. However, he said he will supply masks and encourage players to wear their own gloves.            It's the behaviour of players in dugouts that worries Montreal Softball League president Gil Di Gregorio.            Teammates high-fiving each other, sharing water bottles and spitting out sunflower seeds might be a thing of the past until a vaccine is deployed.            Kincler thinks having players swabbed before taking to the court might be a solution once his league resumes. But the damage may already be done by then.            ---            This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 22, 2020

When things are moving so quickly the main way, we have tried to stay ahead of the curve is by adopting the attitude that this isn’t a journey with a single destination instead it’s a journey of constant discovery. We are always looking for something new and interesting and always moving on to the next destination. So, it goes from being a vision of “When we achieve this, we will have arrived” and instead becomes an ongoing adventure, “What’s next? What will we find now?”

That means putting common sense first.            We must remember, as Lancaster city Mayor Danene Sorace said earlier this month, that we are likely only in the early innings of this pandemic. Our steps must be cautious and continue to be grounded in the advice and guidelines of public health experts.            When this county moves officially into the yellow phase, we’ll be able to leave our homes more freely, but life will still look closer to these past couple of months than it will to life before COVID-19. It would by no means be a snap back to normal.            A move to yellow “does not mean that everyone can throw caution to the wind and abandon the current public health mitigation practices,” Lehman said Thursday. “It means that those practices will become even more important, not just for protecting others, but also to help us defend against slipping back to the red phase.”            It’s a crucial point.            Lives will depend upon our adherence to the state’s public health guidelines. Following those guidelines will give us the best chance of avoiding widespread outbreaks that could stress our health care system, endanger the lives of those most vulnerable to the coronavirus and send us back into a restrictive shutdown.            That's why this holiday weekend must be different.            As LNP | LancasterOnline’s Junior Gonzalez noted, pools won’t be open, parades won’t be held, and ceremonies to honor fallen soldiers have been canceled or moved online.            There will be no trip to the movie theater to see that Memorial Day weekend blockbuster — most of them have been postponed, anyway.            And, any time we’re in public, we must wear masks.            This remains a difficult situation for so many business owners and families. But it is the deliberate path we must follow to avoid greater heartbreak and economic devastation.            With the public health measures that have been put in place, Lancaster County is in position to do that now.            It's up to us to do it smartly and safely.            Enjoy your weekend.

Yes, any kind of stimulus that comes is going to get in the pipeline, it’s going to take some time to materialize into anything, so as we look at it, we’re looking at what’s in front of us right now and then we understand some of the uncertainties in the midterm or later term of the year. But right now, I don’t see any stimulus hitting us in this short time frame with it, it’d be a mid or longer term impact to it, and it’s going to take time to work through the system.

I've always thought that technology can be used for a variety of things: misogynists and feminists can both use Twitter. And [right now] I see people doing a lot of constructive stuff. There is a kind of malleability there. And so that part I think, is good. But I’ve felt all along that there isn't really a substitute for direct and immediate human contact, like experiencing yourself as a member of the public in public space. I think that there's a kind of intimacy, not just in the erotic sense, but of spending time with people in person. The social media version of ourselves is more superficial and I don't think it's an adequate substitute. So I worry about it encouraging us to kind of disembody and withdraw.                  


--DocBreak--
But I think what we're starting to realize now when you see times like this and they create all the need for invention and innovation and it's going the way we were talking about. We just I think we've got to start trying to push it and I think customers will see it. So outside of that capital on things like that basically that's just every time we forecast we look at it and say what do we have. We don't see anything different that the gas and oil markets going to need because of this other than they're always going to need online stable customers and vendors. And I'll tell you, you hear about all the possibilities of bankruptcies in the oil and gas space from the customers, the service folks are going to have that too. So there is probably going to be a lot of companies that are affected by this and we see ourselves coming out the other side of this and being strong. And I think our customers is going to look at who's going to be a long-term vendor for them and what is the right way to go price versus stability as well. So that might play into it as well.

Scientists have never created vaccines from scratch this fast and it’s far from clear that any of the candidates will ultimately prove safe and effective. Often, possible vaccines that look promising early fail after testing expands to thousands of people — one reason the crowded field is important. Many of the candidates work in different ways, and are made with different technologies, increasing the odds that at least one approach might succeed.

Pressuring local police forces to check immigration papers of residents and obligating them to prioritize hunting undocumented individuals will ultimately hurt law enforcement. The George W. Bush administration tried that policy; it did not helpreduce crime, and local police departments resented it and found it counterproductive, diverting them from other anti-crime priorities and alienating local communities. Communities in fear, including those with legal immigration status but whose relatives are undocumented, shut down and refuse to interact with police forces; the sense of alienation grows; and protests against police can escalate—in the process, vital information on serious crime can be lost.

It is Jon, want to try it. Well first I would say permanent is a lot of time. So I don't know that I'd say that work that was not performed or is not being performed now in the second quarter is permanently lost. These are all facilities that have to be maintained, that have some special requirements that are ongoing. So something that was differed now is going to have to be done. The question is when and to what degree. And pacing as we've seen during the second quarter during emergency situations can be moved and so for that reason you always want to kind of gauge your response with that context in mind. You almost feel like you want to hedge your bets even though you're not doing that, you're just trying to be cognizant of the fact that schedules move all the time and for various reasons. But I think having said all that our expectation is that as we've said is that the second half should be a decent second half. We see a pretty good rebound certainly off of the second quarter levels. We originally came into the second quarter thinking it could have been a record second quarter for us believe it or not. And now of course it's going to be what it's going to be but it does bode for a good rebound in the second half at a minimum.

When I contacted Gurian, his first comment to me was, “If you’re into what Lise Eliot believes, I’m not interested in talking.” Her research, he thinks, is too far removed from the classroom to be relevant to education. He claims his work promoting sex-differentiated teaching and single-sex schools is based on “more than 1,000 studies on male/female brains.” The sources listed on his site are a grab bag, to say the least: Mixed in with more recent, peer-­reviewed studies are decades-old papers with names like “Ice-Cream Consumption, Tendency Toward Overeating, and Personality” and “Women’s Preference for Attractive Makeup Tracks Changes in Their Salivary Testosterone,” and a 1999 book called _Why Men Don’t Iron_.

It's D.J.'s job to give the lessons now. After a short stint at Victory Christian, and a few years in the club realm, it's time for Gay to take over a big time team the same way he had to lead the likes of Leonard, Tapley and Thomas nearly a decade ago. Gay will have his hands full in a tough Coastal League that carries some of the best teams in the county. But much like his SDSU roots, change comes slowly and lasts a lifetime.

Most of the vaccines in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize the spiky protein that studs the new coronavirus’ outer surface, so it’s primed to attack if the real infection comes along. The Oxford vaccine uses a harmless virus — a chimpanzee cold virus, engineered so it can’t spread — to carry the spike protein into the body. A Chinese company created a similar shot.

Health insurance benefits for workers remain on paper due to low awareness: Nearly 45 million Indian workers are enrolled under the central government's Employees State Insurance scheme, which provides them a measure of social security and health insurance out of their own earnings. This scheme can provide a crucial buffer to workers during the coronavirus pandemic. A survey of 96 workers revealed that more than 75 per cent of workers did not know about these measures. The lack of awareness not only means they are missing out on the benefits but also that they are losing money from their own pockets. Read more here.

While these efforts are driven by genuine concern about the racial achievement gap, Sherwin, the ACLU attorney, worries that separating students of color by gender “rests on stereotypes that these kids are so unruly and out of control that boys and girls can’t be in the same classroom together.” This is particularly disturbing in light of the recent history of single-sex public education in the United States. Juliet A. Williams, a professor of gender studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, has traced the modern push for single-sex education to the years after _Brown v. Board of Education_ , when school districts separated students by sex at the behest of white parents who balked at the idea of white girls being educated alongside black boys. Sherwin says the rigidity that I observed at Franklin isn’t surprising. Ideas about sex-based differences, she says, “can take on troubling racial overtones about black and Hispanic boys being more disorganized, more unruly, harder to control.”

According to the Mirror, JD Wetherspoon bosses said branches will offer a slightly reduced menu, while all workers will be handed facemasks and protective eyewear, when pubs reopen.

The company said it will open its 875 pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland, when it has the official green light from the relevant governments.                         Under the changes, all Wetherspoons pubs will have screens fitted at the till point, while customers will be encouraged to pay via its smartphone app.                         There will also be screens to create seating areas where it is not possible to separate the tables to the social distancing requirement.                         Wetherspoon will also provide staff with gloves, masks and protective eyewear, which will be made compulsory, subject to government guidelines.                         There will be an average 10 hand sanitiser dispensers around each pub, including at the entrance for customers and staff to use. Guests will be asked to use them when entering stores.                         Every employee will need to complete and sign a daily health assessment questionnaire to confirm that they are fit to work. This will include having their temperature taken using a digital thermometer.                         Dedicated staff will monitor the pub at all times in order to maintain social distancing standards and there will be a member of staff on the door at peak times.                         The pubs will use one entrance with a separate exit door where possible.

MINNEAPOLIS — Sen. Amy Klobuchar, long seen as a possible running mate for former Vice President Joe Biden, is reportedly getting official consideration for the job.

OTTAWA - Canada's contribution to peacekeeping has reached what is believed to be an all-time low, even as the Liberal government makes its final push to secure a coveted seat on the United Nations Security Council.            UN figures show there were 35 Canadian military and police officers deployed on peacekeeping operations at the end of April. That represented the smallest number since at least 1956, according to Walter Dorn, a peacekeeping expert at the Canadian Forces College in Toronto.            The figures are all the more striking given the Liberal government's past promises to contribute up to 600 military members and 150 police officers as part of a broader effort to increase Canada's support to UN peacekeeping.            Canada instead had only 25 Armed Forces members in the field at the end of April, as well as 10 police officers. The military personnel were scattered between UN missions in Mali, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cyprus and the Middle East. The police officers are all in Mali.            The decline coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in fewer overseas deployments for the Canadian Armed Forces and the suspension of many activities, including the occasional provision of a transport plane to UN operations in Africa for the time being.            It also comes as the Liberal government heads into the home stretch of its campaign for a UN Security Council seat, where Canada is up against Norway and Ireland for two non-permanent spots at the influential table.            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been lobbying fellow leaders in the lead-up to a vote at the General Assembly next month, saying the body will play an especially important role in charting a course for the post-pandemic world.            Yet Canada's bid could be hurt by the fact both Norway and Ireland had more peacekeepers deployed on UN missions at the end of April. Ireland had 474 peacekeepers in the field while Norway had far fewer, but still nearly twice as many as Canada with 65.            "Canada's low level of peacekeeping participation is highly detrimental to our bid for a seat," Dorn said. "In fact, you could call it the Achilles heel of the bid. In its past successful bids, Canada used its then-high level of participation to support the bids."

The province has announced that faith gatherings could resume if respecting health and safety guidelines, including the ban on gatherings of 50 people or more.

In the long term, MCC’s presence brings tangible benefits because a community college offers both a fast track to a career and a gateway to continued studies at a four-year college or university. The MCC course offerings are of particular value in St. Joseph because a community college provides the kinds of job-ready skills and adult retraining opportunities that the city’s large manufacturing base needs. It also holds potential for those who seek a career change as the economy slides into recession.                                                                                    We wouldn’t claim to have all the answers for the class of 2020 as these students prepare for the next stage of their lives. It doesn’t matter if they have a plan for a four-year college, a community college, a training program or the military.                                                                                    It does matter that they have some sort of plan, because a high school diploma by itself is not going to cut it. Consider that median weekly earnings are $712 for someone with a high school diploma and $836 for those with a two-year associate’s degree, according to government data. It rises to $1,179 for someone with a bachelor’s degree.

One of the things that I found with 9/11 is that a lot of people in New York City seemed to go back to the lives they were leading before, but some people started projects and shifted their focus and never really stopped. I was just looking at my Twitter feed, and Amy Siskind, who responded to Trump's election as a disaster, which I think is an accurate characterization, is tweeting really useful statistical information. People rise to the occasion. Amy has a different role than she ever had before, as have many people who've responded to these moments. And they're not going home. They'll continue with that kind of higher profile, stronger capacity in civil society.

The plane, which was used by the Forces as a jet trainer until 2000, is largely out of use in the aviation world. The jets were to be retired in 2010, but that was later extended to 2020.            French says it's hard to explain the impact the Snowbirds have on Canada.            The team is in a way an inspiration program, he says, encouraging children who see the planes rip through the sky to chase their own dreams.            French was one of those kids who rushed to see air shows in Abbotsford, B.C., and waited around to get autographs from pilots. It led him into the military, where he became a F-18 fighter pilot and a Snowbirds trainer.            He's in his third year as commanding officer of the Snowbirds. Every member is a highly-trained Forces member who competed for their position, French says.            Most of the year, team members spend all their time together practising routines, then touring across the country. They are more than colleagues, French says. They are family.            It also takes a very dedicated person who truly believes in the team's mission to become a Snowbird, French says. And Casey fit in immediately.            The former journalist joined the military as a direct entry officer in 2014. She worked with the CF-18 demo team before joining the Snowbirds in 2018.            French says the first time Casey went up in the air with the Snowbirds, it was clear she was the right fit for the team.            She was always three steps ahead of what anybody needed. She was creative, kind and hardworking.            "She was one of those people that you just love working with. She raised everybody's game," French says.            "Casey was one of the main reasons that Operation Inspiration was being perceived so well by Canadians. It was her drive and her determination to get us out there."

During last year’s general election in the 97th district -- Lititz, Warwick Township and Manheim Township, Barry Kauffman and Allison Troy flipped Manheim Township’s Board of Commissioners to majority Democrat. Earlier this week Troy resigned her seat after only five months, but the board remains majority Democrat.            This year, Democrat Dana Hamp Gulick is trying to do the same in a race against incumbent Republican Rep. Steve Mentzer.            “We're trying to do the same thing Barry and Allison did, except with Mentzer," Gulick told a supporter signing her petition, as she hit the streets on a cold February morning in a bid to get on the ballot.            She’s optimistic because the demographic shift shows GOP dominance in the district has weakened.            It’s not the first time Gulick has tried to unseat Mentzer. Voters picked Mentzer over Gulick by 13 points in 2018, a much smaller margin than Mentzer won by in 2016 (26 points) and 2014 (29 points).

Bill Trudell, chairman of the Canadian Council of Criminal Defence Lawyers, said fees should be forgiven. He also urged consideration for one-time emergency grants.            Importantly, lawyers say, law societies should make it clear they understand the problem.            "There's no suggestion that the law society is doing anything to reduce its budget, its expenditures," said Richard Fowler, a criminal lawyer in Vancouver. "Even symbolically, it would matter to all of the members if there was some belt-tightening going on to set an example, to show that they appreciate the hardship that many lawyers are going through."            Larry Banack, an emeritus director, or bencher, of the Law Society of Ontario, said the society can and should be helping. Expected expenditures by the regulator for events such as the call-to-the-bar ceremony and monthly in-person meetings of benchers are not happening, he said.            "There are reserves. There is money available," Banack said. "It certainly wasn't intended for this purpose, but perhaps could be realigned or redesignated in a way that could reflect the financial trauma the lawyers and paralegals are experiencing."            Banack noted that car-insurance companies have been giving pandemic-related rebates.            "There's less risk of accidents if the cars are in the driveways," Banack said. "Lawyers are in their driveways. They simply aren't practising."            A spokeswoman for LawPro, which insures Ontario's lawyers, agreed firms are seeing changes in demand — down or up — depending on their field. There's no indication the pandemic will lead to fewer or cheaper insurance payouts down the road, she said.            "Typically, economic downturns have driven up the cost of claims," Naomi Dummett said. "Our claims expenses increased by approximately 15 per cent during the 2008-2009 recession."

Cities and states in the U.S. and elsewhere are attempting to restart their economies in abridged form. Japanese economic activity has never fallen beneath the level to which they aspire. Life has gone on, if not as normal, at least in the form that the new normal will comprise.                                                                                                                  Japan has succeeded in countering both the initial advance of COVID-19 and a complacency spike. Reasons proffered have been many and varied. One that may yet attract increasing attention is its culture of collectivism.                                                                                                                  The mantra routinely heard from Western commentators in respect to COVID-19 is “test, test, test.” Testing, however, does not prevent infection. That is achieved when individuals progress from contraction through to death or recovery without passing the virus on.                                                                                                                  An impediment to that aim is the asymptomatic condition of some carriers, resulting in no one being certain whether they are infected or not. The most appropriate form of prevention is thereby for all to assume they have contracted the virus and act accordingly.                                                                                                                  Practical measures include mask wearing and touching as few public objects as possible. They differ from those that are primarily needed to avoid contracting the virus itself, which are washing one's hands and avoiding hand-to-face contact. Social distancing has commonality to both avoidance and prevention.                                                                                                                  A stumbling block of the “assumption of carrier” countermeasure is that it requires people to endure discomfort for the sake of the collective good, despite the likelihood of being COVID-19 free. Persuading a critical mass of the population to accept such an imposition is a challenging task, especially when new case numbers are in decline.                                                                                                                  Three of the motivating factors that induce Japanese nationals to adhere are courtesy, obligation and shame. Courtesy is the willingness to act out of genuine concern for others. Obligation involves placing the needs of the group before those of oneself. Shame is fear of what others might think if one does not comply to group or societal norms.                                                                                                                  There is no shortage of courtesy among the silent majority of the West, as unlikely as that can sometimes seem. A sense of obligation also exists, but typically toward groups less large than society as a whole. Shame, on the other hand, is not a dominant Western trait.                                                                                                                  Additionally, in some regions of the West, anti-collectivist behavior can be a source of identity and pride. Not everyone within Japan plays the collectivist game. Personal observation suggests that present-day mask wearing runs at around 95 percent, but one wonders how those abstainers would respond if confronted by a TV crew. Probably with a sheepish reply. This differs from the United States, where mask-less demonstrators have been rejecting the notion of social distancing as anti-libertarian, as, indeed, has President Donald Trump himself.                                                                                                                  The concept of liberty is an interesting one. The dictionary informs it to be “the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one’s way of life, behavior, or political views.” Many, however, might wish to facetiously counter with “the right to act irresponsibly, purely because you can.” Regrettably, that would be consistent with the way in which liberty is all-too-commonly claimed.                                                                                                                  An example of asserted liberty during the early days of Japan’s COVID-19 experience was telling. In late January, the government began the repatriation of Japanese nationals out of the COVID-19 epicenter of Wuhan, China. Lacking the legal framework for mandatory quarantine, it requested that the evacuees submit to testing, and undertake 14 days of self isolation. Two of the compliment refused to be tested, leaving Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with no recourse other than to bemoan how “extremely regrettable” the situation had become.                                                                                                                  This story, however, had a less than libertarian ending. The families of the two had their say and both rapidly relented. The irresistible force of liberty, it proved, was no match for that of Japanese collectivism.                                                                                                                  Significantly, in Australia and New Zealand, Western nations with broad similarities to the U.S., dubious applications of liberty are generally given short shrift. These two nations have fared far better with COVID-19 than the U.S. The reasons are again many and varied, but their interpretation of liberty is surely one of them.                                                                                                                  In fairness, collectivism is a concept for which facetious definitions can also be offered. There are times when the merits of collectivist culture can be called into question, as any Japanese national will readily concede. Dealing with pandemic, however, is not one of them.                                                                                                                  “Illness becomes Wellness,” declared Malcolm X, the U.S. human rights activist, “when 'I' is replaced with 'We'.” So it would seem, of the Japanese experience with COVID-19.                                                                                                                   __ __                                                                                                                  Paul de Vries is an Australian writer based in Japan.

Phillip Westry, a 35-year-old public interest attorney, started campaigning a year ago and believes the work he put in before the pandemic struck gives him an advantage over Stokes. Together with volunteers and campaign staff, Westry said he canvassed the district four times, knocking on more than 30,000 doors before the state starting shutting down in mid-March.                                                                 Westry said that outreach allowed him to outpace the councilman in fundraising, as reported in financial disclosures filed in January and April. But going into the final weeks of the race, Stokes had more money on hand: about $46,000 to the challenger’s $32,000.                                                                 Westry said he drew nearly 400 individual donors, many of whom wrote checks for $5, $25 and $50. He has also collected some high-dollar donations, including $4,000 from the Service Employees International Union. It does not represent municipal employees, but has thousands of members living in the city.                                                                 Stokes took in a mix of donations, from $25 to the maximum $6,000, which he received from Carter Paving and Excavating, listed in city records as a certified vendor and minority contractor.

Research shows that single-sex schooling doesn’t measure up to Gurian’s claims. In 2010, Bigler and a team of researchers from the University of Texas, Austin, investigated a public all-girls middle school in the Southwest. On paper, the school was a gleaming example of the success of single-sex education: Its student body was diverse, and its test scores were high. But when the researchers dug into the data, they discovered that the girls who were admitted through a purportedly random lottery were already performing better on tests than their peers in other coed schools—while girls who were denied admission had lower test scores. The students at the girls’ school did no better on standardized tests than their peers at a coed magnet school. In 2014, in a meta-­analysis published by the American Psychological Association, researchers combed through 184 studies of 1.6 million students around the world. Among controlled studies, they could find “little or no advantage” of single-sex schools over coed ones, noting that this undercut assumptions about biological differences between boys and girls.

During this pandemic, however, not all of those things are possible. We can’t crowd three dozen people into our houses and yards to grill burgers, soak up the sun and talk about summer plans. There will be no trips to the community pool. We won’t be watching Bryce Harper launch moon shots over the right-field fence. Or attending a Barnstormers game.            And, though there is some debate and disagreement on the topic, we really should _not_ be headed to the beaches.            But all is not grim.            There is progress.            Here in Lancaster, we will mark a lower-key Memorial Day weekend with cautiously hopeful signs about the days ahead.            Today we begin, unofficially, our second week in the “yellow” stage of Pennsylvania’s reopening plan, following last week’s defiance of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf by local Republicans.            But Democratic Commissioner Craig Lehman said Thursday he sent a letter to Wolf indicating that he, too, now believes the county is “prepared and ready to move from red to yellow.” This is bipartisanship: All three commissioners are now essentially on the same page.            That’s because Lancaster General Health will officially begin countywide testing and contact tracing today. These crucial public health measures — needed to help contain the spread of COVID-19 — were not in place last Friday when Republican Commissioners Josh Parsons and Ray D’Agostino, with the backing of other Republican elected officials, moved the county into the “yellow” phase ahead of Wolf’s order.            With those multimillion-dollar LGH programs — funded by the federal CARES Act and approved by the commissioners — now underway, we feel more comfortable about Lancaster County’s ability to contain any outbreaks and handle more COVID-19 cases.            Whether Gov. Wolf acknowledges the progress our county has made will be answered when he announces today the next round of counties moving to yellow.            It’s essential that the governor and the county be in agreement. Business owners need to know that they can open their doors without being in defiance of Wolf’s legal order.            Whatever happens, we all need to continue doing our crucial part to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Participant Media acquired SoulPancake, actor Rainn Wilson’s digital entertainment media company.

"I created SoulPancake seven years ago with some friends to produce inspiring content and explore what it means to be human," said Wilson, who has appeared in _The Office_ and _Six Feet Under._ "I’m proud of what we’ve built and thrilled to begin working with Participant in SoulPancake’s next chapter. Plus, they gave me a reusable, BPA-free water bottle and introduced me to Al Gore."                                                                                                          SoulPancake CEO Shabnam Mogharabi will become general manager of SoulPancake and report to Participant COO Sam Neswick.                                                                                                            “SoulPancake truly aligns with Participant’s model of creating inspiring entertainment that compels global awareness and action,” said David Linde, CEO of Participant Media. “Rainn, Shabnam, and their team have thrived by creating immensely popular, shareable, and optimistic properties that connect with a large audience, and together we look forward to integrating and expanding their digital video content into a global platform that is thematically and mission aligned and thus stronger and more successful together.”                                                                                                          Soul Pancake’s web series include _Kid President_ and _The_ _Science of Happiness_. It has about 8.8 million social media fans and 1.7 million YouTube followers.                                                                                                          Participant, which earlier this year folded its Pivot cable channel, has produced films including _The Help_ , _An Inconvenient Truth_ and _Spotlight_ , which won the Oscar for best picture.                                                                                                          “We would never have considered an acquisition were it not Participant sitting across the table from us – we are truly professional soulmates,” said Mogharabi. “Participant’s content speaks for itself – their films are meaningful, important, and powerful. We at SoulPancake know how to tackle ‘stuff that matters’ in an uplifting, unapologetically positive way. Combined, our companies will truly be a force for good in the global content landscape.”

The result is one of the most powerful political machines in American history. One that plays a leading role in defining Republican talking points and advancing the agenda of the far right. Fox News tilted the electoral balance to George W. Bush in 2000, prematurely declaring him president in a move that prompted every other network to follow suit. It helped create the Tea Party, transforming it from the butt of late-night jokes into a nationwide insurgency capable of electing U.S. senators. Fox News turbocharged the Republican takeover of the House last fall, and even helped elect former Fox News host John Kasich as the union-busting governor of Ohio – with the help of $1.26 million in campaign contributions from News Corp. And by incubating a host of potential GOP contenders on the Fox News payroll– including Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum – Ailes seems determined to add a fifth presidential notch to his belt in 2012. “Everything Roger wanted to do when he started out in politics, he’s now doing 24/7 with his network,” says a former News Corp. executive. “It’s come full circle.”

Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, and Adam Driver star in this thrillingly dark road trip flick from director Jeff Nichols. The story follows a father (Shannon) and his young, gifted son, who are on the run from the Feds and a religious cult after both groups learn of the boy's special abilities. The sci-fi here is played more for mystery -- we're never quite sure what the boy can do, but it's dangerously big -- big enough to have Driver's government investigator spooked. Shannon is terrific as a father scrambling to do right by his kid, and Edgerton is sturdy as the friend/hired gun who transports them where they need to go.

Yet Gurian is unmoved by the growing scientific consensus around the gender-­neutral brain—in fact, he often rails against the scientists who have shown it to be true. When Eliot tagged Gurian on Twitter to criticize his claim that female brains are hardwired to be better at verbal tasks, Gurian tweeted back, “You are like a climate change denier: a scientist who denies the science.” (“Show me the data,” she shot back, correcting Gurian’s misleading use of math for good measure. He didn’t respond.)This vicious cycle of stereotype reinforcement irks Eliot. “If you want boys and girls to think more similarly, you have to give them more similar training,” she told me. “Everything we know about the brain backs this up.” It’s one thing for parents to influence their kids’ gender biases; it’s another thing when those biases are not just reflected but promoted in our public schools.

Now prior to the lockdown, we used to often snap Tim Tim at his playschool or attending birthday parties, however, amidst the Coronavirus pandemic, since everyone is quarantined at home, and we don’t get to pap Taimur, we stumbled upon a throwback photo of Taimur Ali Khan from Raksha Bandhan, and in the photo, we can see Karisma Kapoor’s daughter, Sameira, tying rakhi to Taimur.

Canada instead had only 25 Armed Forces members in the field at the end of April, as well as 10 police officers. The military personnel were scattered between UN missions in Mali, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cyprus and the Middle East. The police officers are all in Mali.


  The decline coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in fewer overseas deployments for the Canadian Armed Forces and the suspension of many activities, including the occasional provision of a transport plane to UN operations in Africa for the time being.


  It also comes as the Liberal government heads into the home stretch of its campaign for a UN Security Council seat, where Canada is up against Norway and Ireland for two non-permanent spots at the influential table.


  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been lobbying fellow leaders in the lead-up to a vote at the General Assembly next month, saying the body will play an especially important role in charting a course for the post-pandemic world.


  Yet Canada's bid could be hurt by the fact both Norway and Ireland had more peacekeepers deployed on UN missions at the end of April. Ireland had 474 peacekeepers in the field while Norway had far fewer, but still nearly twice as many as Canada with 65.


  "Canada's low level of peacekeeping participation is highly detrimental to our bid for a seat," Dorn said. "In fact, you could call it the Achilles heel of the bid. In its past successful bids, Canada used its then-high level of participation to support the bids."

Initially, its protagonists had to be Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan, with George Raft and Hedy Lamarr in secondary roles and Lena Horne or Ella Fitzgerald singing the song "As Time Goes By", which in the end immortalized Dooley Wilson. The director, Michael Curtiz, was making the necessary changes until he got the final casting. However, the script was never closed and modifications were made every day on the fly, which had the effect of making the actors nervous. The film won three Oscars: director, film and script.

Amazon India said on Friday it has opened close to 50,000 seasonal roles across fulfilment centres and delivery network to meet the surge in demand after the norms were eased in the fourth phase of the Covid-19 lockdown.
 The company said in a statement that there will be a variety of roles in their fulfilment centres and delivery network, including part-time flexible work opportunities as independent contractors with Amazon Flex.
 They will join other thousands of associates and assist them to pick, pack, ship and deliver customers orders more efficiently, it said.
 "One thing we've learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is how important a role Amazon and e-commerce can play for our customers as much as for small businesses and the economy. We take this responsibility seriously, and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help small and other businesses deliver to our customers through this difficult time," Akhil Saxena, vice- president of Customer Fulfilment Operations, APAC, MENA & LATAM, Amazon.
 "We want to continue helping customers all over India get everything they need so they can continue to practice social distancing. To enable this, we are creating work opportunities for close to 50,000 seasonal associates across our fulfilment and delivery network. This will also keep as many people as possible working during this pandemic while providing a safe work environment for them," Saxena said.
 This comes after companies such as Zomato, Swiggy, Ola, ShareChat and WeWork announced layoffs after witnessing a huge drop in business due to the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.

 Revamping jobless aid is fast becoming the focus of debate over the next virus aid package. After the Senate decided to take a “pause” on new pandemic proposals, senators faced mounting pressure to act before leaving town for a weeklong Memorial Day break. The Senate also began efforts to fast-track an extension of a popular small business lending program.
 “Republicans and the White House are reaching consensus on the need for redesigning the unemployment benefits so they are not a barrier to getting people back to work,” Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters on a conference call.

Bloomberg) -- Political momentum intensified this week to curtail investments in Chinese companies, in the latest sign that tensions between the world’s two largest economies have reignited.            While a push for tougher scrutiny of financial ties between the U.S. and China has long simmered in Washington, the Senate quickly -- and in bipartisan fashion -- moved Wednesday to advance legislation that could result in delisting some securities from American stock exchanges.            The added urgency stems in part from mounting calls for lawmakers and President Donald Trump to punish China for its alleged failure to disclose information early on about the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The pandemic has cost more than 90,000 American lives and resulted in tens of millions in job losses.            The economic hit has curbed Trump’s ability to pressure China through tariffs, which can increase costs for American businesses and consumers. That has turned attention to other points of contention, like investment transparency. Earlier this month, the Trump administration and lawmakers stopped the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which oversees a retirement savings plan for government workers, from moving to a benchmark index for its international fund that includes Chinese stocks.            Investor Protection            U.S. stocks dropped Thursday as relations between the U.S. and China -- which had improved with an initial trade deal earlier this year -- appeared to deteriorate after news of the legislation and as strains flared again over Hong Kong.            Proponents of stricter rules on Chinese stocks argue that it’s in the interest of national security and investors.            “The level of fraud, the lack of transparency, the failure for investor protections, that has to be changed,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Thursday during an event hosted by the Washington Post.            The Senate legislation would require companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to certify they’re not controlled by a foreign government. The firms would have to do so because Chinese firms block Washington-based regulators from inspecting financial audits.            The bill says that if the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board can’t review the companies’ audits for three straight years, their securities would be banned from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or elsewhere in America.            A companion bill has been introduced in the House and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that the appropriate committees will review it, but she stopped short of promising a vote.            Goldman Analysis            Wall Street immediately took note of the heightened attention from Congress. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sent a report to clients Thursday that suggested a forced de-listing could lead to abrupt price actions. Chinese companies traded in the U.S. have a market cap in excess of a trillion dollars and about $8 billion of those stocks change hands every day on average, according to the analysis.            Their research examined the Congressional proposal and its potential impact, saying that the focus of U.S. regulators and legislators on this issue has recently been elevated after some recent cases of alleged accounting irregularities.            For some, the need for action was exemplified by China-based Luckin Coffee Inc., a coffee chain embroiled in an accounting scandal. The company recently announced the Nasdaq stock exchange’s intention to de-list the company in a statement.            “Had this legislation already been signed into law, U.S. investors in Luckin Coffee likely would have avoided billions of dollars in losses,” Democratic Representative Brad Sherman of California, who introduced the House bill, said in a statement.            Three Years            Still, the reality is nothing will change overnight, or likely anytime soon.            Even if the Senate bill were to become law, any eventual de-listing of Chinese firms would be years away -- potentially long after Trump and many current lawmakers have already left office.            Roger Robinson, president and CEO of RWR Advisory, a research and risk management consultancy, said the bill is a “remarkable bipartisan repudiation of the preferential treatment accorded to Chinese companies in our capital markets.”            “Three years, however, is far too long before decisive action is taken against non-compliant companies,” said Robinson, who’s long pushed for stricter enforcement of U.S. auditing rules.            SEC Rules            The bill would also require the SEC to write a regulation, invoking the agency’s lengthy rule-making process. Finalizing an SEC rule requires at least two rounds of votes by a bipartisan commission, as well as a series procedural steps like public notice and comment. Trump’s sway over the process is also limited because of the SEC’s status as an independent agency.            So far, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has issued a series of public statements warning American investors about the accounting issues related to Chinese firms whose auditors refuse to open their books. The agency has also announced a roundtable discussion on July 9 that will involve commentary from investors, industry and regulators on risks associated with investing in China and other emerging markets.            Derek Scissors, China scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he doesn’t believe any Chinese firm will either disclose properly or be de-listed as a result of the bill.            “We’ll start another round of negotiations in 2021, no matter who’s president, and announce another agreement in which they falsely promise to disclose and we agree to keep them listed,” he said.            Stock Exchanges            Exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have previously pushed back against the idea of delisting. But they’ve come under increasing government pressure amid the growing fervor for action against Chinese companies. Spokesmen for the NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment.            “We do have some very specific issues with the way that disclosures are provided from certain emerging markets, including China,” Nasdaq Inc. Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said this month in a Bloomberg Television interview.            While the issue has only recently become a political focus for China hawks in the White House, for regulators the problem dates back almost two decades.

Absolutely. So the highest interest that we currently see, which is also intuitively clear, is short trips from metropolitan areas to more remote areas. And that obviously differs then a bit by metropolitan area. But if you take Germany as an example, you should see very, very strong interest in the coastal destinations and in the mountains. And you pretty much see no interest in the metropolitan area. So it's really from crowded areas to basically completely noncrowded, very remote areas. That is the first most obvious use case. With the overall situation and also the comfort level of travelers improving, the next use case is more, okay, it could actually be closer to a town or some activity that will restart at some point in time.

Bloomberg) -- India’s decision to resume domestic flights from May 25 was a bolt out of the blue for most of the country’s aviation companies.            Top executives at three Indian airlines said they learned about the move when the aviation minister tweeted it. The executives asked not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media.            Most airlines have suspended ticket sales at least until June 1 and were staring at a longer stint on the ground, until the minister announced the government’s plan to reopen the skies. Many are puzzled as the lifting coincides with India emerging as a nation where coronavirus infections are spreading at the fastest pace in Asia.            While airlines, strapped for cash due to the shutdown, were waiting for a decision, the short notice makes it harder for them to prepare for operations, deploy staff, arrange for protective gear, and ensure the virus stays away from flights, the people said.            The issue shows the challenge airlines face as the world gradually opens up the skies even as new virus hotspots emerge. The situation is particularly alarming in crowded India, where movement of people from its mega cities to the hinterland has already catalyzed the virus’s spread despite a near two-month nationwide lockdown.            Airlines around the world have struggled to remain in business, with some shutting down, as travel restrictions dried cash flows. The ban on local flights -- which came into effect on March 25, just days after a ban international operations -- prompted industry analysts at CAPA Centre for Aviation to speculate that struggling airlines would have to sell shares to stay alive.            India’s airlines, including InterGlobe Aviation Ltd.’s IndiGo, Asia’s biggest budget carrier by market value, SpiceJet Ltd., Singapore Airlines Ltd.’s affiliate Vistara and AirAsia Group Bhd., have 650 planes between them in their fleet. The country is one of the biggest market for Airbus SE and Boeing Co.

And the easiest way to think about it is on sponsored listings key additional benefit to a traditional auction is that you can get a lot of visibility and a lot of volume into a specific property, which when you think about how capacity can be added and how hotels can be reopened is actually highly relevant to actually fill the hotels that are open very quickly in a very focused manner. So there's big interest and big demand. For display advertisement, there is also very big demand. And there, the key value proposition is that it allows for additional messaging that is on our site. It's in the flow of users searching for accommodation. And there, in particular, the safety standards that is applied to the specific accommodation is highly relevant and can be messaged very well. Both products, as I said, are highly relevant for the recovery phase. And so we expect them to get quite a bit of traction for the month to come with volumes coming back to more decent levels.

A couple of follow-ons. Maybe one to the discussion on different formats. Can you give us a sense of what those breakdowns are now? I know it's newer days on CPA, but where you think they will get to? And then you just mentioned that the take rates aren't necessarily lower. They're more useful to smaller advertisers who don't have as much information to bring to bear on leverage. Do you anticipate a snapback in terms of ad format usage at some point when if we get out of here because obviously, smaller advertisers may not be able to weather the storm. And then you're left with larger guys with more data that they can use on their own, and so hence, maybe more CPC there.

Yes, we began Q2 lift -- the whole run rate in place across the Board. Again it was delaying hirings, it was freezing merit increases, salary reductions, suspending the 401k match. There's -- obviously we're minimizing hours for the hourly technicians, their rates were not adjusted. So, I don't see things that were put in place and of course we stress test the outlook, the forecast to a close scenario as you went through the bank process. So yes, I'm very comfortable we hit that and then we'll hit the floor of the minimum needed requirement because all those core steps were in place beginning of Q2 and there's more support. We'll continue to sort of constantly recalibrate the cost structure of the company to the revenue at hand as we go forward in the year through the ebbs and the flows of the volume. But yeah, we believe the measures were fully in place for all of Q2 on the cost outside.

In the first quarter, we posted solid operating results with revenues better than forecasted and our asset-light business model has continued to generate the positive cash flow for which we had become well-known. We have achieved this despite a quarter that experienced the dual impacts of a weak energy market continuing from late last year, and the global pandemic that began to take root towards the end of the first quarter. As it became clear that we were entering a period of incredible uncertainty, we took immediate action to adjust to these new realities. The immediate focus was on things that we could control with our goal being to preserve and protect our reputation and to reinforce our position as our customers’ preferred partner.

IBM’s existing Planning Analytics powered by TM1 enables a collaborative planning process in which data is connected to a central hub, with workflow approvals and review.                                                                                                                                          "Where we see Planning Analytics On Demand coming in is an extension to that," says David Marmer, vice president of Offering Management for Planning Analytics at IBM.                                                                                                                                          "While it's become a mission-critical system for our clients, it can also sometimes be a barrier for new departments to onboard them or evaluate new use cases that they might want to go to because it's managed by their systems team, who would then have to go through that process."                                                                                                                                          Among the AI-powered capabilities of the offering is the ability to ingest existing Excel spreadsheets used for planning and use them to build a collaborative model and generate dynamic dashboards                                                                                                                                          "The other area that we generally see with AI is the ability to identify variances in plans and things like that that may come from exogenous data," Marmer says.                                                                                                                                          Marmer says these capabilities are essential to help organisations move from an annual planning process based on historical data to a more dynamic rolling forecast process based on current data that gives them greater agility in the face of quickly moving events such as the global Covid-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                          He points to one IBM customer, which manages many restaurants, that is using Planning Analytics to understand various scenarios based on when government-imposed shutdowns of in-restaurant dining end.                                                                                                                                          "They were seeing a 30 percent drop in business," Marmer says. "They still had a takeout business, delivery business, and curbside pickup, but without having the dining services, that's a challenge to them. They've been able to go back and model exactly this: If this is the expected time to open, this is what it means, and this is when I need to bring resources back so I can manage my capital allocation better."                                                                                                                                          Planning Analytics On Demand is designed to allow a department or user to sign up and get running quickly. It has a starting price of $45 per month for one authorised user and a single 2GB application database, and additional users can be brought on for $40 each.                                                                                                                                          The software uses natural language processing to capture and analyse human language data and then recommend improvements to the planning process. Other machine learning capabilities help clients create what-if modelling scenarios without turning to a data scientist.                                                                                                                                          "They can create models, workbooks, invite others to participate, much like they would do in a system that was managed by their systems team, but now they can do it self-service on their own," Marmer says.                                                                                                                                          Planning Analytics On Demand also includes tutorials and demos, as well as the ability to add users and applications as needed.

Under the changes, all Wetherspoons pubs will have screens fitted at the till point, while customers will be encouraged to pay via its smartphone app.                         There will also be screens to create seating areas where it is not possible to separate the tables to the social distancing requirement.                         Wetherspoon will also provide staff with gloves, masks and protective eyewear, which will be made compulsory, subject to government guidelines.                         There will be an average 10 hand sanitiser dispensers around each pub, including at the entrance for customers and staff to use. Guests will be asked to use them when entering stores.                         Every employee will need to complete and sign a daily health assessment questionnaire to confirm that they are fit to work. This will include having their temperature taken using a digital thermometer.                         Dedicated staff will monitor the pub at all times in order to maintain social distancing standards and there will be a member of staff on the door at peak times.

This year's annual session of the ceremonial National People’s Congress is being held under intensive anti-disease controls. Officials are holding news conferences by video instead of meeting reporters face to face. Reporters are required to undergo laboratory tests for the virus before being allowed into the press centre.            Li said the proposed Hong Kong law would create "enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security.”            Beijing has pushed for measures in Hong Kong such as punishment for showing disrespect for the Chinese flag and increasing patriotic-themed education in schools.            Friday's move appears to have been prompted by anti-government protests in Hong Kong that began in June over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to cover other grievances and demands for more democracy. A similar measure was withdrawn from Hong Kong's legislature in 2003 following massive public protests.            The Trump administration is delaying submission to Congress of a report on Hong Kong’s status to see whether the NPC takes steps that “further undermine” its autonomy, said a spokesman for the American Embassy in Beijing.            “Any effort to impose national security legislation that does not reflect the will of the people of Hong Kong would be highly destabilizing, and would be met with strong condemnation from the United States and the international community,” the spokesman, Frank Whitaker, said in an email.            Hong Kong’s main stock market index tumbled 5.6% on the news. Other Asian markets also declined due to concern about U.S.-Chinese tension but none by such a wide margin.            Traders are waiting to see “how severe the terms are” and the White House response, said market analyst Stephen Innes of AxiCorp in a report.            Li urged officials to make progress in an array of areas including employment, trade, attracting foreign investment, meeting the public’s basic living needs and ensuring the stability of industrial supply chains.            Ensuring economic growth is “of crucial significance” even though Beijing set no official target, Li said. Pressure on employment has “risen significantly," he said.            Automakers and other manufacturers say production has rebounded almost to normal levels, but consumer spending, the main engine of economic growth, is weak amid widespread worries about potential job losses.            Forecasters say China is likely to face a “W-shaped recovery” with a second downturn and millions of politically volatile job losses later in the year due to weak U.S. and European demand for Chinese exports.            The ruling party hopes to achieve longer-term goals this year including eliminating rural poverty despite virus-related disruptions of efforts to double economic output and incomes from 2010 levels by this year.            “We will give priority to stabilizing employment and ensuring people’s livelihood, resolutely win the battle to overcome poverty," the premier said.
