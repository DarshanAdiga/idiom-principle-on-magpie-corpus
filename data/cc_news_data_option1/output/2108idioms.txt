The vast womb of mother nature and mother culture has long nourished our growth, but now we are growing up against its limits. Whether in a body or on a planet, this is what triggers birth. We are rapidly entering a state of emergency. It is here that the feminine Yang takes over, bearing down and pushing us forward according to a spontaneous and irresistible rhythm into a new world. We can no more imagine what this world will be like than a fetus can imagine the world outside the womb.

Under the pessimistic case, there is a huge second wave of infections of the coronavirus, putting a strain on medical systems simultaneously grappling with the onset of a new flu season. The economy could be mired in a deep depression, with devastation expanding beyond the travel and leisure businesses that were initially hit hardest.
 On the other hand, by then, the worst could be over. Heat and humidity could dramatically increase the caseload over the summer, and states could be much more prepared to ward off a second wave. And the first set of vaccine results could reveal a breakthrough, suggesting a light at the end of the tunnel and validating Trump’s “warp speed” declaration regarding vaccine development.
 States could be months into reopening by then, and pent-up demand could start to lift businesses.
 There are, of course, many scenarios in between, and we don’t know how any of them would affect the public’s thinking as to whether it’s time to change horses or stay with Trump.
 Finally, Biden cannot stay in his basement for the next five months fielding softball interviews that he still manages to stumble through.
 At some point, there will be a real campaign, which will require Biden to be challenged, scrutinized and put under fire. He’ll have to face Trump in debates in the fall — whatever form they might take.
 Trump could clearly lose. But even in a good year, polls are fallible. During a time when many people don’t know if they’ll be able to watch football or send their children to school, it’s especially silly to lean on polling to predict outcomes in November.
