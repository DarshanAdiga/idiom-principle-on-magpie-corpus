The Texas Department of Public Safety announced Wednesday a person was arrested regarding a hit-and-run wreck that killed a man last Friday morning three miles north of Gilmer.
 This person has been charged with criminally negligent homicide, DPS Sgt. Jean Dark said.
 The driver of a black Dodge Ram pickup was driving north on US Highway 271 North in the inside lane when the driver made an unsafe lane change. The pickup struck a 2008 Ford Crown Victoria, making the Ford cross into the southbound lanes of traffic, according to DPS.
 The Ford was then struck by a 2019 Kenworth truck-tractor and trailer. Frederick Fountain, 38, of Irving, who was driving the Ford, was taken to a Tyler hospital, where he later died. The driver of the Dodge pickup left the scene after the wreck, DPS said.
 "We truly appreciate the support from the community as we continue to work toward the safety and protection of the citizens of Texas," Dark said.

 Fitting so many marathons into one month will mean running every Saturday and Sunday as well as taking days off work – he is a content editor for the R&A – and he believes 16 would be “the absolute maximum” he could have managed, both physically and logistically.
 “My entire month will be working, running and whinging, probably,” he said.
 “I’ve got a plan but it’s a bit like the boxing quote of everyone’s got a plan until they get punched in the face – there’s no telling how I’ll feel after two marathons, after five marathons, so I’m well aware that any plan will probably get moved about.”

"So many of the rooms have gotten to the point where you can only do so much to modernize education in a building that old," Barnard said. "When things like (the septic system failing last winter) or a roof fails, those are really big projects.

The education secretary also said guidance was being drawn up on how schools can safely operate despite the threat of Covid-19, with extra cleaning and hand hygiene procedures working alongside "quick access to testing" for anyone who develops symptoms.


  He cited "detailed scientific advice" that young people are less at risk from the virus, saying there had been no deaths of people aged under 16 in Scotland and only 42 cases where patients of that age had to go to hospital.


  Ministers have been advised that physical distancing should not be needed between children, but Mr Swinney said secondary schools should "take a practical approach in maintaining distancing between pupils where possible", including by adjusting the layout of classrooms and the flow in corridors.


  Teachers will be required to stay 2m away from other people "wherever possible", but the wearing of face coverings will not be enforced. Mr Swinney said this should be "left to the judgement of individuals".


  ## 'Last minute'


  The Scottish Conservatives questioned the government's "refusal to commit" to reopening schools in August given pubs and restaurants are already back in business, with education spokesman Jamie Greene calling on Mr Swinney to clear up "uncertainty" for parents.


  The education secretary said it was "important we make the judgement at the correct moment, when we can see some of the effect of the relaxation of lockdown".


  Labour's Iain Gray said the government had never drawn up a detailed "route map" for a return to schooling, saying it "looks as though they're making this up at the last minute".


  He said the influx of new staff amounted to "less than half a staff member per school" and left little time for councils to actually hire them before August 11.


  Mr Swinney said he was speaking to councils about recruitment and financial support, adding that he was "very keen to ensure newly qualified teachers are able to be utilised within the education recovery work that is being taken forward".


  The education secretary is also to give evidence to Holyrood's education committee in a virtual meeting on Monday, 27 July.


  Ministers will make a final decision about whether it is safe to go ahead with the reopening of schools in a cabinet meeting on 29 July, with their decision to be announced in parliament the following day.

 # Ball, Martirano call for dialogue on police presence in Howard County schools

 In the wake of protesters and supporters in the Black Lives Matter Movement calling for a re-evaluation or defunding of the program that places police officers in county public schools, County Executive Calvin Ball has called for a community conversation to examine the efficacy of the program.
 The function and existence of the school resource officers program has ranked high among grievances of protesters this summer as issues of police brutality and racial equity have gained prominence following the killing of George Floyd by a police officer May 25 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

JOHANNESBURG - Liverpool fans are still reveling in the scenes from Anfield on Wednesday night where Jordan Henderson became the first Reds captain to lift the Premier League trophy.
 Liverpool beat Chelsea 5-3 as a precursor to the ceremony itself.
 Fans from around the world tuned in to witness the historic moment and it was no different in South Africa.
 Chairman of the Liverpool Gauteng supporters club, Ian Parker, was among those fans.
 “Its been a long time coming. We’ve been close but no cigar for a while, so it was great to see it last night (Wednesday) and to be a part of it on the fan wall was also really cool.
 "Liverpool are the leading club in the United Kingdom in terms of fan base, we have the most supporters clubs in the world, with the most supporters so it just shows what a global family we are,” Parker said.
 Parker’s association to Liverpool goes back to when he was playing under 5 football for Kempton Park, with the club displaying similar colours to that of the Liverpool kit at the time.
 “That’s basically where it started from and it's just grown from there,” he said.
 In terms of the squad and the backroom staff at the club, Parker believes that Jurgen Klopp has made all the difference.
 “I’ve had the opportunity to meet Jurgen and he just exudes this presence about him that you wouldn’t get from normal people. I made a call a while ago that he is going to be as big as [Bill] Shankly and I think he is still going to prove that,” he said.
 The lifting of the Premier League trophy caps of an amazing 12 months for Liverpool in which they won the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup.
 So where does this current crop of players rank among the all time great teams to wear the famous red shirt?
 “The football played today is different to the football that was played 30 years ago. In those days a tackle could put in the third row of the stands, nowadays there’s no tackles like that, but if you look at the modern football era, this is a team that can go down in greatness,” Parker said.

The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it is sending $5 billion to nursing homes and state veterans’ homes to fight the growing coronavirus epidemic. The money can be used to hire additional staff, implement infection control, increase testing and provide additional services, such as technology to allow residents to connect with their families. The infusion comes from the provider relief fund contained in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package that the US Congress passed in late March. It’s in addition to the $4.9 billion nursing homes are receiving to offset revenue losses and to respond to the pandemic. Nursing home staff must complete an online training program for a facility to receive the new funds. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will also start requiring nursing homes in states with a 5% or greater coronavirus positivity rate to test all staff each week. This was previously a recommendation. The administration announced last week that it is distributing rapid testing devices to nursing homes, which had complained that they don’t have the money to conduct so many tests. More than 15,000 devices will be deployed in coming months, with more than 600 shipping this week. The American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL) said Wednesday that the increased funds are “a significant step forward,” but more is needed, especially in light of the surge of cases around the country. “It is equally important for Congress to provide an additional $100 billion for the HHS Provider Relief Fund, which is accessible to all health care providers impacted by COVID-19,” said CEO Mark Parkinson.

Initially, the cause of the ghost boats in fishing grounds in the Sea of Japan, known in the Koreas as the East Sea, was a mystery.
 It was thought climate change had forced the North Koreans to travel further from their shores to catch squid, resulting in them becoming stranded at sea and dying of starvation, hypothermia or dehydration.
 Squid stocks have declined by more than 70%.
 Many boats that wash up are found with no-one on board, leading to suspicions in Japan that they were carrying spies or even people who travelled there to deliberately spread a contagious disease.

“So because it was such a well received program by The Meadows and because we were looking for a sharing project from our guild, I thought it would be a good idea if I applied again in 2019/2020, and we were fortunate that we were able to do that,” she said.
 A portion of the grant was also used to fund the cost of materials for the Quilts of Valour project that provides quilts to Canadian veterans. Marcie Erick, a regional coordinator for Quilts of Valour Canada, and members of the Southwest Quilters Guild made 12 quilts for veterans. Erick had already presented these quilts individually to the recipients.
 There are currently around 25 guild members, and most of them were involved with this project to make bed quilts for Clover House.
 “It depends on people's time that they're able to commit,” Mulhern noted. “A lot of our members still work, a lot of them have commitments to other activities like farming. So I think there were about 12 or 15 of us who worked on this quite diligently, and other people came and helped on sew days. They cut out fabric, they gave advice as to placement of pieces and colour blocking. So it by and large was a whole guild project.”
 The presentation of these quilts to The Meadows was originally scheduled to take place at the Southwest Quilters Guild’s biennial quilt show in Swift Current in April, but the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This outdoor presentation was therefore made at The Meadows and everyone wore masks as an additional precautionary measure.
 Mulhern has a very personal connection to a quilt she made for the Clover House project. The flannel backing for this quilt originally belonged to her mother, who passed away in 1986. She loved to quilt and her favourite fabric was flannel.
 “So it's also a little bit of a memory of my mom that’s being passed on,” she mentioned during the presentation. “So hopefully the people in palliative care can achieve a sense of comfort and strength and know that every stitch that went into these quilts comes with our best wishes for the very best health outcomes that they can have.”

Ramus - who also goes by the name Adrian Daniel Cope - of Allerton Street, Grangetown, Cardiff, pleaded guilty to two counts of being concerns in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine, and two counts of possession of heroin and crack with intent to supply when he appeared in the dock.
 The court heard that among his previous conviction are one for supplying crack cocaine from Maidstone Crown Court in 2003, and one for being concerned in the supply of heroin from Swansea Crown Court in 2008 for which he was sentenced to six years.
 Christopher Rees said that as a third-strike dealer his client knew he was facing the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years prison - but it was to his credit that he had never-the-less answered his bail, and turned up to court.
 Judge Geraint Walters told Ramus that "those who peddle Class A drugs do nothing other than peddle misery" \- misery for the addicts, and misery for the communities which had to put up with drug dealing and drug use.
