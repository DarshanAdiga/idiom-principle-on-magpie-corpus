Later, just before half, with the Browns in the red zone, Sutton aligned at safety in place of Terrell Edmunds, rolling down as the “sky” defender in his Cover 3 assignment. As Baker escaped the Steelers rush to the sideline, Sutton made sure to stay in Baker’s throwing window long enough, before triggering Baker's takeoff and forcing him to run out of bounds near the line of scrimmage, receiving credit for a sack in the process. On the final play of the third quarter, Cam Sutton, responsible for a hook/curl zone assignment with the Steelers deploying Cover 2, failed to occupy his zone, allowing Jarvis Landry to cross his face into a vacant zone, ending in a 24 yard gain. At the snap, Sutton opened outside and melted to the flat, which was occupied by Steven Nelson, placing two Steelers defenders in the flat, opening a massive hole over the middle. The Steelers secondary is full of veterans to the system, Sutton included, making these communication miscues completely unavailable, and something that could persist as the Achilles heel of an elite unit.

 The 30-year-old midfielder has picked up a calf issue and will face a late fitness test ahead of the Bet365 Stadium encounter.
 Northern Ireland midfielder Jordan Thompson could step up to start if Clucas does not make the grade in time.
 Nathan Collins is available after Stoke won their appeal against a three-match ban following his red card in the 2-2 draw with Barnsley.

With that, the celebration was on. Eastern had its first sectional title since 2007. For the lone senior on the squad, the championship felt “really good.”
 “I had I think it was 36 kills that game, and to get it on the last point was such a great thing,” Evans said. “We were really just hoping for the sectional title, and to have that as my last point of my last sectional game of my senior year — pretty memorable.”
 Memories are up for grabs again on Saturday. Eastern’s sectional title booked the Comets a spot in Saturday’s Norwell Regional.
 Eastern is in its second season of Class 3A competition. The Comets avenged losses to Mississinewa and Western en route to the title.
 “I was so happy because the past three years we lost first round of sectionals,” Evans said. “We haven’t even gotten to a sectional championship in a long time. When we drew Mississinewa [in the opening round] we were pretty excited because even though we had lost to them earlier in the season, we knew that was a good game to start and we could work up to Western or Northwestern.
 “After the game, I could not stop smiling at all because I was so happy and so proud of what our team had done.”
 A sectional championship seemed like a distant dream a few weeks ago. The Comets started the season 1-7. They’ve gone 21-6 since then and captured their third straight Hoosier Heartland Conference title — winning a league-deciding match over Carroll, which won a Class 2A sectional title on Saturday.
 “Our first couple weeks were pretty rough,” Evans said, “but then we started playing really well together. That Carroll match was a really good match for us and we realized we definitely had the ability to win the sectional because we all played really well together and worked hard and didn’t give up at all.”
 Evans said the turnaround came from “communicating. That is really the key to everything that we’ve done so far. We had a completely different lineup because we had some girls injured. We started communicating and realizing we needed to become closer as a team in order to play well together.”
 Volleyball is fast. Communication has to flow constantly. It starts before the match as passers, hitters and setters plot out how to defend and score. It continues between points and when the ball is in play.

“It will be an honor to work with our players and to work for Mrs. Benson and David Griffin, Trajan Langdon, their staff and the great people of New Orleans,” Van Gundy wrote. “I can’t wait to talk to our players and get the process started.”
 Among the players he’ll talk to is veteran locker-room leader JJ Redick, who spent his second through sixth NBA seasons playing for Van Gundy in Orlando. Redick has readily credited Van Gundy for helping him develop into a reliable double-digit scorer.
 “In terms of intangibles and characteristics I think any NBA player should have, I think he taught me those things and he reinforced those things in me — professionalism, accountability ... not taking any nights off, all that stuff, because he lives that,” Redick said of Van Gundy in 2016, when he played for the Los Angeles Clippers and Van Gundy was coaching Detroit. “I see how hard he works, how much he invests in his craft, and so as a player, playing for him, you really have no choice but to do the same.”
 In New Orleans, Van Gundy will replace Alvin Gentry, who was let go after the Pelicans missed this season’s playoffs. Part of the problem for the Pelicans this season was that Williamson missed most of the season; he averaged 22.5 points and 6.3 rebounds per game on 58% shooting, albeit in only 24 games.

The unexpectedly good harvest and climbing crop prices also came as a surprise to agricultural economists, who in July were expecting many Indiana farmers to break even without making any profit.
 Michael Langemeier, associate director of Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture, said now farmers who grow both corn and soybeans are expected to make about $100 per acre.
 “Oh, how things change,” he said in a webinar earlier this month.
 Winger said a major reason for the recent spike in crop prices comes from China, which has started to import U.S. corn and soybeans after years of negotiating new trade deals.
 Another factor comes from the derecho wind storm that hit in August and decimated crops in states such as Iowa, which increased the overall demand for the crops that survived in states like Indiana.
 Maple said whatever the reason for the price spike, the extra income will be very welcome in a year in which most farmers were gearing up to take a major financial hit.
 “The prices were troublesome in the early part of the summer, but now as we’re getting toward the finish line, it’s really improved,” he said. “It’s setting us up for a situation where we’ll see some profits this year, when we were expecting to end up in the red.”
 Statewide, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is forecasting corn and soybean yields to be at record highs.
 Corn yield is expected to be 189 bushels per acre, which is 20 bushels higher than last year, when weather decimated yields. Total production is expected to be 992 million bushels, up 22% from 2019. Soybean production is also expected to see huge yields totaling 341 million bushels, up 25% percent from a year earlier.
 If the USDA’s forecast is realized, this year will be the highest Indiana corn and soybean yields on record.
 Maple said in the end, this year’s harvest marks a bright spot in what has been a roller-coaster year for agriculture markets, but that uncertainty is something every farmer lives with during every season.
 “It’s not a business for the faint of heart,” he said. “It’s just part of farming. You get used to it. There are years that are a struggle, and there are years where you really do well.”

Screening for the disease includes colonoscopies, which are used to identify and, when possible, remove polyps and other growths. Fecal tests can be useful in identifying blood in the stool. Each of these can be indicators of cancer or a pre-cancerous condition. A study published last year found the updated age guidelines for colorectal cancer screenings can prevent about 30,000 potential cases each year and save 11,000 lives. Not all insurance companies are on board with the new guidelines, though, and some patients would have to pay for earlier screenings themselves.
 As for why the disease is striking an ever-younger population, researchers still aren't sure. Some suspect changes to behavior, as well as environmental factors, and have launched studies to learn more. Others worry that younger adults are ignoring the physical symptoms that may indicate the presence of colorectal cancer. These include visible blood in the stool, particularly when it's bright red in color; rectal bleeding; persistent sensations of pressure within the bowel and abdomen that are not relieved by a bowel movement; ongoing abdominal pain and cramping; weakness or fatigue and unexplained weight loss. Another indicator is changes to bowel habits that last more than a few days, such as constipation, diarrhea or a change to the shape of the stool.

Jordan Dangerfield once again logged extensive work on special teams, playing 20 snaps across multiple units while recording two solo stops on the game. On the game’s final kick return, just before half, Dangerfield appeared confused at who to pick up, and was ultimately late getting to his blocking assignment. As a result Dangerfield was unable to execute his kick out block with proper leverage, forcing Ray-Ray McCloud to cut to the sideline, with no visible lane in sight. On the final punt of the first half, Dangerfield made a physical pickup on a free rusher up the middle, ultimately saving what would have been a devastating blocked punt just before half. The personal protector job requires both high football IQ as well as physicality, two traits Dangerfield’s game is built around.

 “But now, this season before the Olympics, I found it again. And I don’t know how, or why. It’s just I feel it. I feel it in me. I feel like it’s driving me to work harder and do better every single day, and that’s what’s been keeping me going through these really difficult times.”

We’ll see how this week goes, but I’ve done my best to prepare.”

Plain and simple, when the secondary performs like they did yesterday, in tandem with the league’s best pass rush, this defense is near impossible to score on, even for the league’s premier offenses.

As for the Tennessee Titans, their offense is third in efficiency -- fifth via the pass and eighth via the run.

Minkah’s presence in the middle of the field alone makes quarterbacks hang onto the ball longer, wary of his presence, allowing the Steelers pass rush to routinely pressure opposing quarterbacks at extremely high rates. Moving forward, as the Steelers continue to move Minkah around, it will be interesting to see if he is ultimately deployed as blitzer in the coming weeks, as he has bluffed blitz alignments multiple times thus far, before ultimately dropping into a robber zone. While Minkah’s performance this week is certain to quiet critics for the time being, I would expect Minkah’s presence to be felt on frequent splash plays moving forward, particularly if the Steelers pass rush continues pressuring quarterbacks at record numbers.

It's had a deep effect on all of us. Many of the kids had never even heard of Matthew Shepherd and were shocked and appalled on hearing about the event. They couldn't fathom that someone would do this to a human being based on his orientation. Their empathy quickly turned into passion and a personal responsibility for telling this story accurately and in the best way possible. For me, it brought back deeply personal memories, that over time were subconsciously buried. I was a fifteen-year-old confused adolescent when Matthew's murder took place. I remember feeling afraid and unwanted or unnatural. That the world was against me because of what they did to Matthew, and listening to horrible things they were saying on TV and on the news. It was a very different time 22 years ago, and luckily we've taken large strides forward in our society, but there is still a very long way to go as we try to extinguish hate educate each one another. We hope this show sends a message of love and humanity, and during a period of so much division in our country, that it shines a light on the beauty and importance of our differences and how we can still come together and respect each other as a people.

On the game’s lone touchdown, the communication issues were once again present, with Mike Hilton, operating as the Cover 3 flat defender, failing to get under a wide open Rashard Higgins in the corner of the end zone. Joe Haden had melted over the top of the inside seam route, thus making it Hilton’s responsibility as the flat defender to melt underneath the outside receiver. Mental mistakes hurt this defense on a weekly basis, and further elimination of them could help this defense continue to give quarterbacks nightmares in the coming weeks. Midway through the third quarter, Hilton, playing from linebacker depth, once again displayed his blitzing prowess, displaying perfect timing and knifing through the B-gap untouched. Ultimately, Kareem Hunt was able to break free of his tackle attempt, but Hilton stopped his progress, allowing for Bud Dupree to corral Hunt after a short one yard gain, attempting multiple “peanut punches” as he approached the back from behind.

Marc Elias, a Democratic attorney with the Perkins Coie firm, is working in conjunction with the Biden campaign and recruiting lawyers to help expand voting rights and rules.
 He’s had setbacks in Florida, where he represented U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in his losing reelection effort during the 2018 recount, falling short to Rick Scott by 10,000 votes. A federal appeals court in April also rejected Elias' arguments to overturn the Florida law that lists the candidate of the governor’s party on the ballot first. Democrats claimed the first-choice appearance put them at a slight disadvantage – enough to decide Florida elections, even though Democrats passed the law when they held power in the state.
 But Elias has had a series of wins in other states recently, including a U.S. Supreme Court decision on Monday allowing Pennsylvania to count mail ballots received three days after Election Day and a federal appeals court Tuesday approving more time for mail-in voters in North Carolina to fix, or "cure,” ballots if there was an issue, such as a missing signature, that would cause it to be rejected.
 Other voter access issues are cropping up around the country as well, including a fight over efforts by California Republicans to set up unofficial drop boxes for mail ballots, long early voting lines in Florida and Georgia, and online voter registration systems that went down on the deadline to register in Florida and Virginia, where both states extended the deadline.

Minkah Fitzpatrick pitched in an impressive performance, playing all 57 defensive snaps and silencing critics with an emphatic pick-six on the Browns opening possession, while also chipping in a solo stop and a pass defense for the afternoon. Minkah made his impact felt early on, initially aligned in a two high safety shell, before rolling down late into a robber position, jumping a slant route, and returning an interception for 33 yards on the game's first touchdown. The monumental play put the Steelers up 10-0, a lead which they would never relinquish, and displayed the merit within the Steelers plan of rotating Minkah around the field more often. As the Steelers had played a Cover 2 drop zone on the play before, Baker Mayfield made a pre snap read to throw the inside slant, where his receiver appeared to have an isolated one on one matchup with Cam Sutton. Thus, Minkah’s decision to hold his rotation until post snap helped him surprise Baker, inserting himself into the slant window, and reminding fans why the team traded a first rounder for him just a season ago.

Harrogate’s in-form Jack Muldoon is enjoying some of the best football of his career, according to manager Simon Weaver.
 Town have made an impressive start to life in the English Football League, with Muldoon’s six goals in five appearances propelling them up to fourth in the Sky Bet League Two table.
 “He definitely is,” Weaver told the PA news agency when asked if Muldoon was playing at the peak of his powers. “He’ll admit the same.
 “At 32 he’s such a specimen, fitness-wise. He does all the drills at full tilt every training session.
 “There’s never any slowing up or him thinking he’s done really well first few weeks so he can ease up, he’s hungry for more.”
 Muldoon scored the club’s first Football League goal in their opening-day win at Southend and struck winners in their last two matches, against Barrow and Grimsby.
 Weaver believes the former Lincoln and Fylde forward epitomises all that Harrogate currently stand for after gaining Football League status for the first time via the National League play-offs in August.

Due to the investment the community has made in North Branch Area Public Schools, the district is able to provide new in-person learning opportunities, when applicable, to its students.
 During the North Branch School Board meeting Oct. 8, Director of Building and Grounds Art Tobin provided an update on the construction improvements and energy efficiencies within the district buildings.
 With the exception of the secure entrance at Sunrise River School, which was funded through grant dollars, the improvements Tobin highlighted were completed through the successful passing of a bond referendum in May 2017 where voters approved three questions.
 The three questions the voters passed enabled the district to fund safety and security improvements, deferred maintenance and updates to classrooms and other district facilities; enabled the district to expand and improve gym and athletic program space at the middle school and high school; and provide funds to support technology used for classroom instruction.
 Superintendent Sara Paul thanked the community for their support of the district.
 “We are so excited about and appreciative of the community for the investment that they’ve made, for us to not only upgrade but to add to high-quality learning spaces,” Paul said. “Art Tobin, he is our director of building and grounds, and he truly puts the art in building and grounds. He is an exceptional leader that takes attention to details of all aspects of creating these learning spaces. He has worked in partnership with leaders like David Treichel and building principals to really make some thoughtful and intentional decisions that impact the daily experience of our students. ... The reality is that COVID hitting really put a heavy hit against a lot of school districts across the nation. And the thing that is really interesting to me is that the way we’re positioned, due to the community’s investments, has given us enough space to spread kids out. It’s given us high-quality learning spaces that have high air quality and ventilation. Even in the context of COVID where we’re not fully able to benefit from the learning spaces that we’ve created for the purposes and intention behind them, ... we are able to keep kids in school because of the investment the community has made in our learning spaces.
 “These spaces really are about preparing our students for their future. This year our kindergarten class is representing the graduating class of 2033 and we need to give them the best we have to offer,” Paul added.
 Tobin thanked the district administrators for all their support.
 “A friend of mine told me a long time ago, many hands make light work, and without you people, my teammate, superintendent, there’s no way that this would have been accomplished,” Tobin said.
 Tobin highlighted the learning stairs at the high school.
 “I didn’t know if I was in favor of learning stairs, but, boy, it comes in handy and the kids love it,” Tobin said. “It’s a break-out space, it’s a place to see what we were seeing tonight. The learning stair is used a lot more than I ever thought it was going to be used in the short time that we’ve been dealing with COVID and everything.”
 Tobin explained the benefit to the furniture in the break-out spaces and the learning areas is it’s not all stationary and can be moved as needed.
 “It’s what we need it to be,” Tobin said. “We talk about teachers, we talk about David Treichel and how we use different areas and always coming up with different ideas to excite the kids to get them to learn and get them to be part of everything — the furniture, it’s just an awesome way to be and the way that we can break that stuff out.”
 Tobin touched on the ProStart area, an area that was finished last year. The ProStart is a career and technical education program that unites the food service industry and the classroom to teach high school students culinary skills and restaurant management principles.
 “But the ProStart area, when we went into it, we thought that the people that were putting the equipment in, but to be very honest with you, the other schools that were so jealous that they didn’t have what we have. Not because we had it and they didn’t, but the things that we could do with it,” Tobin said. “When you take a look at what these kids are doing, and the ability to learn, and the different things that they can do and the interests that are in there, it’s not like when I went to school. People are really excited to get there and I think it’s a wonderful space. We watch cooking shows on TV. Again, many hands make light work. When you take a look at the monitors that are put in place and the IT that was there, there’s not a space that you get lost in the ProStart area. There’s different areas. You can pay attention to everything from the back of the room as well from the front of the room. It’s a great experience.”
 Tobin touched on the brand-new stage at the high school and how the seating is also new.
 Energy efficiency is also of utmost importance to the district.
 “We do our energy efficiencies every day,” Tobin said. “I have conversations with our finance director Todd Tetzlaff about what we can expect to save on energy costs as we go forward. How we can monitor them? Why are we burning three boilers when we only need to burn one boiler?”
 At the middle school, Tobin highlighted the Life Work Center space, which provides life skills and work exploration programming for young adults with disabilities ages 18-21.
 “It’s a beautiful space. People enjoy going there. It’s clean and it’s welcoming and inviting,” Tobin said.
 Tobin mentioned the middle school is now all conditioned, so the district can monitor temperature, humidity and other aspects of the building. He said a new feature is the building now has occupied and unoccupied settings, a setting that is now available within all district buildings.
 “So if we’re going to have this meeting, we look at the facility calendar. We see when that meeting is scheduled and about a half hour before we believe that meeting is going to be over with, we set that timing so that it goes to an unoccupied setting and we coast out of that meeting. In the summer time, we are going to bring that temperature up, we’ll let it rise up about 4 degrees, 5 degrees, and in the winter time we’ll let it cool down,” Tobin said. “So we’re making sure that people are comfortable and we’re giving those comfort levels when people are occupying those spaces and we’re also not wasting energy when they’re not occupied. So we go to an occupied/unoccupied setting on all of our buildings now.”
 At Sunrise River School, Tobin highlighted the new secure entrance, as well as the more efficient furniture that allows for social distancing and multi- purposes within the school. The school also has new open areas, new paint, new soundproofing and a new energy efficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning system.
 “Right now when we’re washing our hands a lot, we drop that temperature down just a little bit on our hot water temperature so to make sure that those kids got that hot water on their hands all the time, that it’s doing what it’s supposed to be doing,” Tobin said.
 The Brooker building, which houses the Norse Area Learning Center, has a brand-new kitchen area, brand-new surfaces, is handicap accessible and has remodeled bathrooms and classrooms.
 Tobin explained the North Branch Area Education Center has break-out spaces to allow for social distancing, window seatings for the students, a bright and colorful playground, a renovated kitchen space with new energy efficient coolers and appliances.
 “It’s really a wonderful space,” Tobin said. “The rooms are bright. They are large spaces, there are open spaces, there are creative spaces. It’s really a plus.”
 Tobin highlighted there is also energy efficiency climate controls throughout the building.
 “Thank you all. This has been truly a labor of love to do this and I couldn’t have done it without the support and leadership of the people that I work with every day,” Tobin said.
 Board Member Tim MacMillan thanked Tobin for all his efforts.
 “Art, thank you for the level of detail and expertise on HVAC and all that,” MacMillan said.

On the day, the Steelers defensive backs were visibly more competitive at the catch point, helping rush and cover work in tandem for the first time all season. Haden’s final pass breakup of the day came on the Browns final possession, working in a Cover 4 Palms scheme. Haden took patient steps utilizing a shuffle technique before flying out of his break, triggering on an out route, and putting a big hit on Donovan Peoples-Jones while getting a hand in to break up the pass. Haden contested the catch point tightly all day en route to his best performance of the season, helping give us a glimpse of what this Steelers defense can become if rush and cover work are in sync. While I still contend that Joe Haden has lost a step, he will continue to benefit from the Steelers use of Cover 2, as well as trap coverages, where he can use his elite instincts and technique to wreak havoc in the quick game.
