The sad irony is that the peace process desperately needs new ideas, even if the ideas revealed today and the means by which they were developed and announced were not ideal. And given the longstanding positions taken by the current Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the only credible source for those new ideas is the United States. Too many Israelis believe time is on their side because of the current status quo is perceived to be infinitely extendable; too many Palestinians believe time is on their side because of their demographic growth. Unfortunately, both can’t be right over the long run. The current path, in the absence of a credible peace process, leads inexorably to a terrible choice between a Jewish minority trying to indefinitely rule over an Arab majority, or the kind of violent catastrophe that changes the demographics of the area. Neither of these scenarios should be acceptable to any side.”

Food matter will occasionally accumulate in the drain and cause a clog. If an ordinary drain cleaner does not remedy the clog, you'll have to get your hands dirty. To repair a clogged drain, place a bucket underneath the drain. Next, use a pipe wrench to loosen the fittings on the P trap. Remove the P trap. Once it's been removed, try to locate the clog and clean it out. If the clog is not in the P trap, you may need to thread an auger or a snake down the drainpipe to free the clog.

One final consideration is water and energy use. The U.S. government's Energy Star guidelines have a chart that lets you compare annual energy usage of many different dishwasher models. If you're keeping an eye on your utility bills and are concerned about the environment, this chart can help you find the right model. How much can you expect to pay for a modern dishwasher? A reliable, functional model without any extra features costs around $200. The $300 to $700 price range contains models with extra cycles, adjustable racks, larger tubs and better materials. Prices go all the way to about $2,000 for European dishwashers with every possible feature, including built-in water softeners and water cleanliness sensors.

It’s tiki week at Speak of the Devil.
 The neighborhood bar at 201 W. Fifth St. will host guest bartenders from Lost River, self-described as a “rum-focused tropical neighborhood bar on Detroit’s East Side.”
 Guest takeovers are not new among the boutique cocktail bars across northern Ohio, said Kurt Hernon, who owns Speak of the Devil with his wife, Page.
 But it is the first time Speak of the Devil has had guest bartenders from out of state.
 Hernon said they discovered Lost River on a trip to Detroit.
 “I just really liked what Lost River did so a few months ago I just cold called them,” he said.
 To the Hernons’ surprise, staff there had heard of Lorain and their bar.
 “Literally, within an hour, they were like, absolutely, we’d love to come down,” Hernon said. “Let’s face it, it’s kind of cool that a bar would want to come down from Detroit to little old Lorain, Ohio.”
 Super Bowl week has become Speak of the Devil’s own tiki week, with special decorations and a tropical-inspired drink menu.
 “It’s the end of January, dead of winter, get some nice sunny drinks out for people and make them forget about it for a couple of days,” Hernon said.

Mostert may have assumed control in the 49ers' backfield, but it's still the guys in front of him (as well as Kyle Shanahan's play-calling) who make their running attack so potent. For the year, the 49ers averaged 154.2 yards per game on the ground, second-best in the league. But the Chiefs must now contend with a running attack that just pasted 285 yards on the Packers last week and has run the ball for 471 yards, including a jarring 290 yards after contact, in two postseason games. Kansas City's run defense was 26th-ranked in the NFL but has improved in recent weeks -- the Chiefs stunned the Titans by holding star Derrick Henry to 69 rushing yards after he had three straight games of more than 180 rushing yards. But San Francisco's zone-blocking attack is as lethal as it is relentless as the 49ers ran the ball 82 percent and 69 percent of the time during their two playoff wins. The only way the 49ers deviate from what works offensively is if the Chiefs can somehow slow them down.

The depth you plant your seeds depends on their size. They only need enough soil to cover them and supply moisture for germination. Seeds buried too deep may not be able to struggle through the soil to the surface. As a rule of thumb, seeds should be covered up to twice their diameter at their largest point. After you've set the seeds at the correct depth, firm the soil by tamping it with your hands or the end of your garden rake. This will improve contact between the seeds and the moist soil.

Discovering clogs or jams in garbage disposals is not uncommon, but measures can be taken to prevent them from ever forming. The blades in a garbage disposal will become dull over time, and many home repair experts suggest feeding a variety of materials, such as chicken bones or glass, into the disposer to sharpen the blades. Regardless of what you might hear, the only safe material to feed into your disposal to sharpen the blades is ice. You should also avoid feeding materials with husks, such as corn, and stringy vegetables, such as celery, into your disposal to avoid a jam. In addition, avoid pouring grease down the drain as it can clog. If you have poured grease down the drain, try running hot water for a few minutes to flush it out.

Fears of the spreading virus have already pushed airlines around the world to reduce flights to China and global companies to restrict employee travel to the country, while sectors from mining to luxury goods have been shaken by concerns for global growth in the event of a worst-case pandemic.
 China's National Health Commission on Wednesday said the total number of deaths from the flu-like virus rose by 26 on Tuesday to 132, while the number of confirmed cases rose by 1,459 to a total of 5,974.
 New cases were also reported around the world, including Germany where four people from the same company were infected after one of them contracted it from a colleague while visiting their workplace in China.
 The German cases raise concerns about the human-to-human spread of the virus which can be transmitted in droplets from coughs and sneezes and has an incubation period of up to 14 days.
 Known as "2019-nCoV," the newly identified coronavirus emerged late last year in Wuhan, a major transportation hub and capital of central Hubei province with a population of 11 million people.
 China has since moved to lock down most of Hubei province, with a population around the same as Italy, to contain the epidemic. Most of the confirmed deaths and patients from the outbreak are in Hubei.
 Health authorities believe the virus originated from an animal and have pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was traded illegally.

It's been years now since I rode on a carousel, but I think I'd love to try it again someday. For adults, it's just a lot of slow spinning in circles, but when viewed through the eyes of a child, it's pure magic. When we let our imaginations come out to play, everything becomes a thrill ride. And, for me, that pretty much sums up my art journey. It's definitely been a thrill ride every step of the way. I'm actually quite busy with my day job lately and these posts are appearing a bit later than usual. My friends are asking me if I'm still making something each and every day and I tell them, "yes, I am!" Then they make that astounded face and ask me how I manage to keep doing it. I don't have a perfect answer to this. I stop and consider it and lots of things come to mind, but there's never one that justifies something they would associate with commitment. If I were to answer with what I truly feel, they would think I was perfectly insane. I would simply say, "if you had a chance to ride a colorful carousel each day, wouldn't you take it? It's so much fun! It's only a matter of choosing the right horse."

Former GB athlete Oliver Glasgow QC (left) helped three police officers restrain a man who jumped from the public gallery as the gang were being sentenced yesterday. The melee erupted as the judge handed down their jail terms for the brutal murder of Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck, 19, (inset) and enraged supporters of the killers started shouting abuse. An umbrella and a seat from the dock were thrown across the court and the defendants Tyrell Graham, 18, (top, middle) Sheareem Cookhorn, 21, (top, left) and 17-year-olds Jayden O'Neil-Crichlow (bottom, left) Shane Lyons (top, right) and Ojay Hamilton (bottom, right) began fighting in the dock as they were led out of court. Prosecutor Glasgow, 48, who once represented Great Britain at the Duathlon World Championships and prosecuted in the trial of the Lee Rigby killers, rushed over to tackle the man who had jumped from the public gallery. The man yelled, 'I will murder you' to Mr Glasgow and those trying to restrain him he was bundled out of the court and handcuffed in the corridor outside. The Old Bailey then went into lockdown as three City of London police vans carrying up to 30 officers, including dogs, were called to the scene. Mr Glasgow remained calm and told concerned onlookers 'I am fine', when asked how he was.

Former Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk once said, “A good teacher is like a candle — it consumes itself to light the way for others.” The same could be said of Frankfort High School Principal John Lyons, who announced Monday he will be leaving FHS after 4½ years at the helm to fill a vacancy on the Kentucky Workforce Innovation Board.
 During his tenure, the school improved its standardized test scores and saw a solid increase in enrollment. In 2018, Frankfort High was ranked as the 19th best school in the state in U.S. News and World Report’s Best High Schools ratings. That same year the school was among the top 13% of Kentucky high schools.
 FHS was also awarded one of only seven Gene Bottoms Pacesetter School Awards — which honor schools using "High Schools That Work Key Practices" to change teaching and learning methods and motivate students to succeed in college, careers and life.
 But even more than the accolades, Lyons brought the Panther community together by building a team atmosphere and being emotionally invested in the school, its students and staff — all of which was on full display by the number of fans in the stands during the boys basketball team’s run through the All “A” Classic last week in Richmond.
 “You fit Frankfort High like a glove,” Frankfort Independent Schools Board Chair Jina Greathouse told Lyons at Monday evening’s board meeting.
 Many school board members and staff echoed Greathouse’s sentiments, including FIS Superintendent Houston Barber, who thanked Lyons for his inspirational work and wished him luck in his new role.
 “I’m really excited about all the things we’ve been able to do during my time here at Frankfort High, and I saw this as an opportunity to impact and affect more,” Lyons told The State Journal.
 While we too will miss him, we have no doubt that Lyons will continue to make a difference in the lives of young folks. After all, as Father James Keller put it, “a candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.”

McConnell convened the meeting shortly after Trump's legal team made its closing arguments in the trial.
 There are still several days before any potential witness vote would be taken. A decision to call more witnesses would require 51 votes to pass. With a 53-47 majority, Republicans can only afford to lose three.
 If senators agree they want more witnesses they would then have to vote again on which ones to call.
 The news came as Trump's legal team argued forcefully against the relevance of testimony from Bolton and concluded their defense as the Senate braced for debate on witnesses.
 While scoffing at Bolton's manuscript, Trump and the Republicans have strongly resisted summoning Bolton to testify in person about what he saw and heard as Trump's top national security adviser.
 Senate Republicans spent two days behind closed doors discussing ideas to satisfy those who want to hear more testimony without prolonging the proceedings -or jeopardizing the president's expected acquittal.
 Those lost steam, and Democrats showed no interest.
 Chuck Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, called a proposal for senators to be shown the manuscript in private, keeping Bolton out of public testimony, "absurd."
 "We're not bargaining with them. We want four witnesses, and four sets of documents, then the truth will come out," Schumer said.
 'Senators are being warned that if they agree to call Bolton to testify or try to access his book manuscript, the White House will block him, beginning a weeks-long court battle over executive privilege and national security. That had seemed to leave the few senators, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have expressed a desire to hear new testimony without strong backing.
 Also, other Republicans including Sen. Pat Toomey want reciprocity -- bring in Bolton or another Democratic witness in exchange for one from the GOP side. Some Republicans want to hear from Biden and his son, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when his father was vice president.
 A day after the defense team largely brushed past Bolton, attorney Jay Sekulow addressed the controversy head-on by dismissing his manuscript — said to contradict a key defense argument about Trump's dealings with Ukraine — as "inadmissible."
 "It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts," Sekulow said.
 The argument built on a separate one Monday night from Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz, who said that nothing in the manuscript — even if true — rises to the level of an impeachable offense. Sekulow also sought to undermine the credibility of Bolton's book by noting that Attorney General William Barr has disputed comments attributed to him by Bolton.
 The legal team also delved into areas that Democrats see as outside the scope of impeachment, chastising former FBI Director James Comey and seizing on surveillance errors the FBI has acknowledged making in its Russian election interference probe.
 Trump's attorneys argued that the Founding Fathers took care to make sure that impeachment was narrowly defined, with offenses clearly enumerated.
 "The bar for impeachment cannot be set this low," Sekulow said. "Danger. Danger. Danger. These articles must be rejected. The Constitution requires it. Justice demands it."

Good general garbage disposer maintenance includes a periodic purging of the drain line leading from the garbage disposal. You should also purge the line after removing sludge and debris because it ensures that all dislodged items make their way down the drain. This can be accomplished by plugging your drain, filling your sink with 2-4 inches of water and then removing the drain plug and turning on the garbage disposal. Then all of the collected water gets pulled through the line. In addition to being a part of good maintenance, you should also clear your drain line each time after you dispose of particularly fibrous foods. It will help ensure that all of the food particles make their way down the drain.

Sketching this carousel was fun because it was a lot to cram into one little sketchbook. So, I also had to let Little Charlie do the coloring as well, because my adult brain exploded wondering how to get all of the details in there. As it turns out, color comes in to the save the day again and dabs of various colors can make a rather convincing facsimile of a carousel, when viewed from a safe distance of course. Zoom in closer, and indeed, it's just a riotous mess of color dotted into places. This is when I'm at my happiest. When I'm approaching my sketches with all the reckless joy of kid at a carnival. I've no clue if things will turn out okay, but I always have faith in the process and rather like how Little Charlie paints. That's why I always tell people to check in with their inner child as often as possible. It doesn't have to inform your style as it does mine, but when things get stressful, that silly adult brain is _always_ to blame. In those moments, I always hand the crayons over to the kid inside and start to play.

"It's a great plan for Israel. It's a great plan for peace," he said.
 He vowed to immediately press forward with his plans to annex the strategic Jordan Valley and all the Israeli settlements in occupied lands. Netanyahu said he'd ask his Cabinet to approve the annexation plans in their next meeting on Sunday, an explosive move that could trigger harsh international reaction and renewed violence with the Palestinians.
 "This dictates once and for all the eastern border of Israel," Netanyahu told Israeli reporters later. "Israel is getting an immediate American recognition of Israeli sovereignty on all the settlements, without exceptions."
 Given the Palestinian opposition, the plan seems unlikely to lead to any significant breakthrough. But it could give a powerful boost to both Trump and Netanyahu who are both facing legal problems ahead of tough elections.
 Trump called his plan a "win-win" for both Israel and the Palestinians, and urged the Palestinians not to miss their opportunity for independence. But Abbas, who accuses the U.S. of unfair bias toward Israel, rejected it out of hand.
 "We say 1,000 no's to the Deal of the Century," Abbas said, using a nickname for Trump's proposal.
 "We will not kneel and we will not surrender," he said, adding that the Palestinians would resist the plan through "peaceful, popular means."
 The plan comes amid Trump's impeachment trial and on a U.S. election year, and after Netanyahu was indicted on counts of fraud, breach of trust and bribery in three separate cases. The longtime Israeli leader, who denies any wrongdoing, also faces a March 2 parliamentary election, Israel's third in less than a year. He hopes to use the plan, and his close ties with Trump, to divert attention from his legal troubles.
 The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem — areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war — for an independent state and the removal of more than 700,000 Israeli settlers from these areas.
 But as details emerged, it became clear that the plan sides heavily with Netanyahu's hard-line nationalist vision for the region and shunts aside many of the Palestinians' core demands.
 Under the terms of the "peace vision" that Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been working on for nearly three years, all settlers would remain in place, and Israel would retain sovereignty over all of its settlements as well as the strategic Jordan Valley.
 "The Israeli military will continue to control the entire territory," Netanyahu said. "No one will be uprooted from their home."
 The proposed Palestinian state would also include more than a dozen Israeli "enclaves" with the entity's borders monitored by Israel. It would be demilitarized and give Israel overall security control. In addition, the areas of east Jerusalem offered to the Palestinians consist of poor, crowded neighborhoods located behind a hulking concrete separation barrier.
 Trump acknowledged that he has done a lot for Israel, but he said he wanted the deal to be a "great deal for the Palestinians."
 The plan would give the Palestinians limited control over an estimated 70% of the West Bank, nearly double the amount where they currently have limited self-rule. Trump said it would give them time needed to meet the challenges of statehood.
 The only concession the plan appears to demand of Israel is a four-year freeze on the establishment of new Israeli settlements in certain areas of the West Bank. But Netanyahu clarified later that this only applied to areas where there are no settlements and Israel has no immediate plans to annex, and that he considered the plan to impose no limitations on construction.
 Thousands of Palestinians protested in Gaza City ahead of the announcement, burning pictures of Trump and Netanyahu and raising a banner reading "Palestine is not for sale."
 Trump said he sent a letter to Abbas to tell him that the territory that the plan has set aside for a new Palestinian state will remain open and undeveloped for four years.
 "It's going to work," Trump said, as he presented the plan at a White House ceremony filled with Israeli officials and allies, including evangelical Christian leaders and wealthy Republican donors. Representatives from the Arab countries of Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates were present, but there were no Palestinian representatives.
 "President Abbas, I want you to know, that if you chose the path to peace, America and many other countries ... we will be there to help you in so many different ways," he said. "And we will be there every step of the way."
 The 50-page plan builds on a 30-page economic plan for the West Bank and Gaza that was unveiled last June and which the Palestinians have also rejected.
 It envisions a future Palestinian state consisting of the West Bank and Gaza, connected by a combination of roads and tunnels. It also would give small areas of southern Israel to the Palestinians as compensation for lost West Bank land.
 But the many caveats, and ultimate overall Israeli control, made the deal a nonstarter for the Palestinians.

As the day wore on, Trump's lawyers turned the Senate into a corruption trial against former Vice President Joe Biden, his son, Hunter, and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Hunter's participation on the company's board of directors is only relevant to the current dismissal from the Senate insofar as the Republicans accuse that history validates Trump's declared desire to get to the bottom of corruption in Ukraine.

Netanyahu and his main political challenger in March elections, Benny Gantz, had signed off on the plan.
 "Mr. President, because of this historic recognition and because I believe your peace plan strikes the right balance where other plans have failed," Netanyahu said. "I've agreed to negotiate peace with the Palestinians on the basis of your peace plan.
 The Jordan Valley annexation is a big part of Netanyahu's strategy and a key promise meant to appeal to his hard-line nationalist base, which mostly applauded the Trump plan.
 U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the plan's release, said they expected negative responses from the Palestinians, but were hopeful that Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab nations to have peace treaties with Israel, would not reject it outright.
 Jordan gave the plan a cool reaction, saying it remained committed to a two- state solution based on Israel's pre-1967 lines. It also said it rejected any unilateral move by Israel, referring to the annexation plan.
 The reaction of Jordan, which would retain its responsibilities over Jerusalem's al-Aqsa Mosque under the plan, is particularly significant. Located next to the West Bank, Jordan also is home to a large Palestinian population.
 Egypt, the first Arab country to reach a peace deal with Israel, urged Israelis and Palestinians to carefully study the plan. The European Union also said it needed to study it more closely.
 Saudi Arabia, another key Arab country, said it appreciated the Trump administration's efforts and encouraged the resumption of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians "under the auspices of the United States."
 U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations supports two states living in peace and security within recognized borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, according to his spokesman.
 The Palestinians see the West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state and east Jerusalem as their capital. Most of the international community supports their position, but Trump has reversed decades of U.S. foreign policy by siding more blatantly with Israel. The centerpiece of his strategy was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the American Embassy there. He's also closed Palestinian diplomatic offices in Washington and cut funding to Palestinian aid programs.
 Those policies have proven popular among Trump's evangelical and pro-Israel supporters.
 But the Palestinians refuse to even speak to Trump and they called on support from Arab leaders.

Photos taken in the aftermath of the crash (left and inset) show the flaming wreckage of the chopper after the pilot had told air traffic controllers he was climbing to avoid a cloud layer. Ara Zobayan had asked for and received special clearance to fly in heavy fog just minutes before the crash and was flying at 1,400 feet when he went south and then west, an accident investigator said Monday. They also revealed there was no black box on board but instead an iPad which was used for flight itinerary as the crash site in Calabasas, California is being actively patrolled for looters by officers on horseback. Pilot Zobayan asked for air traffic controllers to provide 'flight following' radar assistance but was told the craft was too low for that assistance, Jennifer Homendy of the National Transportation Safety Board said. The crash killed NBA legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna (pictured together right) as well as pilot Zobayan and six others.

When choosing a new garbage disposal, your decision may hinge on a few key factors. You'll want a minimum one-half (1/2) horsepower motor and you'll want to look for stainless steel parts to avoid corrosion. Unless you have a good reason for getting a batch feeding model, you'll also want to look for continuous feed. Batch feed disposals are the kind that run when you insert a special sink stopper in the opening and turn to activate the system. Continuous feed disposers typically operate by a wall switch. Another good rule of thumb is that the larger the garbage disposal, the quieter it will generally run - an important consideration over the life of heavy usage.
