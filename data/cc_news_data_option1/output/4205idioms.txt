What has struck me the most from all the photos I have seen, however, is the contrast between the environment in which free education is taught compared to that which comes at a high cost. When it comes to financial resources, I do not see why state schools should be the Cinderella of education, because from its constant propaganda it is clear that this administration always manages to find enough money for other, less urgent, projects. Surely it can dig deep and find money to make its schools the best in the country, not only by ensuring that they are aesthetically pleasing but, especially during this pandemic, that they are supplied with everything they need to keep students and teachers safe.

"A Song for the Dark Times," by Ian Rankin (Little, Brown)
 Ian Rankin's best-known character, John Rebus, typically resides in the dark world of the human soul and things are no different in "A Song for the Dark Times," Rankin's newest Inspector Rebus novel.
 However, Rebus is an inspector no more and in fact the well retired copper is moving apartments in the opening of the story to a ground floor flat, due to ill health, assisted by trusted friend Detective Inspector Siobhan Clarke.
 With a dog named Brillo to mind and boxes -- including stacks of old case files -- to unpack, the reader might be forgiven for thinking Rebus will be relegated to the sidelines. Not so. The murder of a wealthy Saudi student in Edinburgh, followed by a mysterious missing person case, one with a close family connection to Rebus, has the retiree heading to the Scotland Highlands to investigate.
 Rankin's plot whips between the two cases, like a Scottish gale, with Clarke and team investigating the murder -- the case touches on recent real-world events such as Brexit, anti-immigrant violence and the murder of Adnan Khashoggi. Rebus, meanwhile, attempts to mend fences with his partially estranged daughter, Samantha, as he searches for her missing partner and probes possible links to a local commune and an abandoned World War Two internment camp.
 The Rebus of "A Song for the Dark Times" is a slightly diminished one -- he is drinking less, nor do we find him sparring with local Edinburgh gangster Ger Cafferty, though he does play a role in the drama. The retired detective is a wee bit less enjoyable to read, but he is a familiar character with whom the reader will feel comfortable.
 Rebus is still the dogged investigator, able to make intuitive leaps about the dark places that inhabit the human soul and lead some to commit murder, whether in the distant past or in more recent times. Rankin will in time, likely retire Rebus for good, so we should appreciate him while we still have him.

The world is drowning in plastic. The sheer volume and variety of plastics on the market, and its persistence in nature, create significant risks for human and animal health and the survival of sensitive ecosystems.
 To its credit, the Canadian government wants to start addressing the problem. Last week it released a scientific assessment of plastic pollution alongside a plan to manage it. Canada proposes regulating plastics as a toxic substance under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, and to ban outright the manufacture and import of many single-use plastics by 2021.
 But the U.S.-based plastics industry is saying not so fast — and invoking provisions of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). In late September, a coalition of U.S. industry associations representing chemicals, fossil fuels, food packaging and transportation wrote to Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng, asserting Canada’s plan to ban certain single-use plastics, set recycled- content requirements for plastic products and packaging, and develop standards for extended producer responsibility violates international trade obligations and the USMCA.
 ADVERTISEMENT
 Threatening a trade dispute is a common scare tactic to discourage regulation. Still, the ink was barely dry on the USMCA before the plastics lobby seized on it to raise doubts about Canada’s plastic pollution plan. Claiming the scientific assessment isn’t based on “sound science,” and that regulators didn’t use a “risk-based approach” or engage in regulatory cooperation discussions beforehand, the industry says Canada’s plan is an unlawful trade barrier and must be stopped.
 The devastating consequences of global plastic pollution are so well- established and significant that the United Nations urged action under the Basel Convention on hazardous waste. As the U.N. observes, “Plastic accounts for around 10 percent of the total waste generated and constitutes approximately 90 percent of all trash floating on the ocean's surface, with 46,000 pieces of plastic per square mile. It is nearly impossible to clean the seas from plastic waste and microplastics.” The USMCA itself requires Canada, Mexico and the U.S. to each “take measures to prevent and reduce marine litter.”
 Yet the chemical lobby makes the claim not only that Canada’s proposed measures limiting plastic waste and pollution are unsupported by science, but that they would “undermine partnerships and progress against marine litter” pursuant to international commitments. Apparently, the industry is using the promise of its future voluntary cooperation to postpone or bar more effective regulatory measures now — relying on language in the USMCA to make its case.
 Before the USMCA was approved by Canada, Mexico and the U.S., we warned the agreement’s regulatory cooperation provisions could provide opportunities for enhanced corporate meddling and an excuse to evade and delay regulations. A Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives report authored by Stuart Trew found even voluntary regulatory cooperation has helped multinational business interests weaken standards for rail safety, workplace hazard labeling and chemicals risk assessment. We worried that incorporating these provisions into an enforceable trade agreement would further undermine public protections.
 Our fears were well-founded. Business interests have already cited these provisions to question Mexico’s law requiring junk food warning labels. The salvo against Canada’s plastics regulation is part of an international campaign to use trade agreements to limit controls on plastic exports and regulation. The New York Times documented that many of the lobby groups behind the letter to Canada’s trade minister want to use a proposed U.S. trade agreement with Kenya to roll back the African nation’s 2017 ban on plastic bags and force Kenya to continue importing waste plastics. The story prompted a bipartisan group of 62 U.S. lawmakers to urge U.S. trade negotiators not to undermine Kenya’s policies to regulate plastic products and wastes. This trade-based corporate strategy is crucial for the fossil fuel industry, which has pivoted hard into plastics in anticipation of a sharp drop in oil demand as countries try to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
 ADVERTISEMENT
 All countries need the regulatory freedom to take the plastics crisis seriously. Expansive new language in the USMCA chips away at that freedom. Regardless of whether the oil, chemicals and plastics firms would have a winnable case against Canada, the USMCA offers new tools to strip public protections. Canada and Mexico are already facing the consequences of agreeing to corporate-written deregulatory text in the USMCA. The Trump administration is using the USMCA as a template for new trade deals. Other countries, including Kenya and the United Kingdom, should steer clear of U.S. demands for new regulatory restrictions in any trade deals resulting from current negotiations.
 Ultimately, these measures will blow back on the U.S. as well. Future U.S. governments looking to rein in the fossil fuel sector and strengthen environmental protections may find themselves tangled in a trade dispute of their own making.

Expectation management or the lack of it. Many people start businesses thinking they will make lots of money immediately. Think of the Metroplex Mall in Naalya. It almost gets a tick everywhere — a middle-class neighbourhood, off a major road network (by Ugandan standards), and big car parking lot. But when the mall opened for business, the shoppers didn’t turn up in numbers that could sustain it. I am told the original owners have since sold and the buyers are redesigning it. The original owners are seasoned businessmen, but this project failed to work. So it is not automatic that once you start a business, it will succeed. If you talk to all seasoned entrepreneurs, they will tell you of many ventures that didn’t work. Failure in business is common, some even argue it is the norm. Business is like song or a movie, it is hard to know which will become a hit or blockbuster until long after it is released. The businesses that succeed are because their owners have learnt to manage their expectations.

"The lads that are out of contract have been key players for a significant amount of time," he said. "We've had the same squad now for a long, long time - certainly in football terms 12 months is a long time.
 "Although the four lads aren't moving on, they've got limited time left and I know people might think 'but what's the problem?', well the issue is we've got key players that are running out of time.
 "If you've got work colleagues and you're all in the same position and boat, naturally everyone has got their eyes on the prize and knows what's happening.
 "These lads are young lads with their futures in the balance and their contracts running out.
 "From my perspective, I want to put that to bed as quickly as possible and let them focus on one thing which is getting the best results for Preston North End - I'm not suggesting that that's not the case, but it's always difficult when that's hanging over your head.
 "There are certain things I would like resolved but sometimes it's not within our control to because it takes all parties to agree.
 "I'm not going to sit here and cry about it, but is it a concern for me? Of course it is, but I need to crack on."
 In terms of the transfer window - which has been and gone - Neil has already sympathised with the club for having to try and strengthen the squad during a pandemic.
 But with one player brought in, the Scot is understandably left feeling a little underwhelmed.
 "I sound like a broken record because I've been saying the same thing for three years, but our squad hasn't really changed over the last 12 months," he said. "We've added two players, so the same messages are still the same - it isn't anything different to what it was before.
 "Naturally as a manager I want a stronger squad, I want to go and add numbers and I think freshening the squad up is really important.
 "It's been well documented that we've bought a training ground - so yeah, we've added one player.
 "Would I have wanted more? Of course I would've but we are where we are and we are going to the Premier League looking for a bailout like every other team."
 There was continued speculation throughout the summer about Ben Davies and Daniel Johnson - the pair were the subject of interest and bids from other clubs.
 North End's boss though, says that nothing ever came even close to happening.
 "What happens is, if you say something often enough it then becomes the truth," he said. "The simple fact is, over the course of the window we didn't receive anywhere near a significant enough offer for our players that we've made it our duty to keep.
 "If you've got something worth £500, you don't sell it for £50.
 "It seems to be documented that we're fending teams off left, right and centre but it simply isn't true.

DeCourten said the altered DNA methylation is one of the plausible ways that future generations would experience health impacts from previous generations' exposure. Hormone-disrupting compounds have been shown to impact DNA methylation, which is an important marker of how an organism will develop.
 "Methyl groups are added to specific sites on the genome, [the exposure] is not changing the genome itself, but rather how the genome is expressed," she said. "And that can be inherited throughout generations."
 In addition, Brander said there are essentially different "tags" that exist on DNA molecules, which tell genes how to turn on and off. She said the exposure to different compounds may be "influencing which methyl tags get taken on or off as you proceed through generations."
 The researchers said the study should prompt future toxics testing to consider impacts on future generations.
 "The results … throw a wrench in the current approach to regulating chemicals, where it's often short-term testing looking at simple things like growth, survival, and maybe gene expression," Brander said.
 "These findings are telling us we really at least need to consider" the next two generations, she added.

 Exchange operator Euronext said it halted trading in all its products on Monday due to a technical issue, affecting equities trading in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.
 The widespread outage has hit trading in cash equities, derivative products and commodity futures across Europe.
 “No one can trade at the moment, everything is on standstill,” said Mikael Jacoby, head of continental European equity sales at Oddo Securities in Paris.
 The outage follows a severe one on the Tokyo Stock Exchange earlier this month, which brought stock markets in Japan to a complete standstill, in the worst ever outage for the worlds third largest equity market.
 “We are working to resolve this issue and we will provide an update as soon as possible regarding the expected pre-opening time and resumption of trading,” said Euronext, which operates France's blue-chip index CAC 40.
 A spokesperson for the company declined to provide further details on the reason or the expected duration of the outage.
 The CAC 40 was up 0.8% at 4,976.15 points before the halt. Germany's DAX and London's FTSE 100 have all drifted lower in the last 30 minutes.

Both are known as defensive gurus, even though the coaching styles might be different.
 "It's definitely night and day how they go about it, but they're two great coaches," Collier said. "I'm blessed to play for Pete, the energy he brings. He's locked in every day. When you buy in, you see the results.
 "Just like with Coach P. Every Saturday, if you listened to what he said throughout the week, the defense was going to be dominant."
 That's the mindset Collier likes to take to the field. This is a guy who said before the draft that he liked to get in the faces of offensive linemen, knowing he'd "kick their ass" with a bull rush.
 Collier is starting to do that, highlighted by the game-ending tackle on Newton.
 "It felt good to finally help the team out and be active with my guys," Collier said. "It was fun. I really enjoyed it; hopefully, the first of many. We had a good game plan going into it and just made a play."
 Collier has continued to make plays, including in the Seahawks' last game against the Vikings. He sacked Kirk Cousins in the second quarter and then helped prevent a two-point conversion by the Vikings in the third quarter.
 Collier remembers the plays he doesn't make as well. He believes that he should have four sacks instead of one by now.
 "I've left four out there. I've got to finish," Collier said. "But it's good to get the first one, and I feel like they can roll in now. There's plenty of football left, and we're trying to go all the way this year. I've got to keep getting better, don't listen to the outside noise, and just focus on getting better and having consistent pass rush games.
 "For me, it's all about -- how can I finish off strong?"
 Outside of his on-field play, Collier has enjoyed living in a new city and learning what life is like as an NFL player. His roots will always be in Munday, Texas, though, and that's where his thoughts were during the bye week.
 One of his close friends, Cassandra Ledesma, was involved in an automobile accident earlier this month and sustained serious injuries.
 "I want everyone to know I'm praying for her," Collier said. "She's like a sister to me. She's a fighter. She's going to pull through."

By Sophie Davies
 Oct 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Ivana Gaziova had an abortion as a teenager, she didn't want to talk about it to anyone apart from her closest cousin. Six years on, a push to tighten Slovakia's abortion law impelled her to speak out.
 Gaziova, a waitress from Bratislava, has gone public with her own story to campaign against the government-led proposal, which critics see as part of a trend towards more socially conservative policies in central Europe.
 "We should all talk about it, it's just normal for you to decide what's going to happen with your own body... but girls feel guilty because they think society will judge them," Gaziova said.
 Incensed by the centre-right government's proposal, which is due to be debated by parliament later this month, Gaziova, 23, has made a podcast, given newspaper interviews and started filming a documentary about her experience.
 If approved, as is widely expected, the reformed law would still allow abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy but women would be required to present additional paperwork and state their reasons for seeking a termination.
 Abortion clinics would also be banned from advertising and the mandatory waiting period before having the procedure would be doubled to 96 hours.
 It is rare for women to talk publicly about abortion in Slovakia, a mainly Roman Catholic country that is largely conservative on social issues.
 "Even in local Slovak media, there is almost a total absence of real-life stories about abortion, there is still stigma around abortion in society and it's still not a normalized issue," said Alexandra Demetrianova, a campaign coordinator at Amnesty International in Slovakia.
 Gaziova, who also works as a dancer, said the lack of counselling or support services after her abortion had made it harder for her to come to terms with it and discuss it openly.
 "I wasn't happy talking about the abortion at first... it just happened and then I returned to my normal life," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.
 She said her decision to seek a termination when she was 10 weeks pregnant was painful, but that she had not felt ready to become a mother so young. She was 17 and still at school at the time.
 "I knew that I was doing the right thing because I wasn't able to take care of the child, but at the same time I didn't want to do it," she said.
 'PERSONAL AND PRIVATE'
 Last year, 7,153 abortions were carried out in Slovakia, compared to 6,000 in 2018. Abortions have nearly halved from nearly 11,000 a decade ago.
 Christian lawmakers, who have proposed the tighter abortion controls, have said the reform will help women make the right decision.
 But rights groups in the country of some 5.5 million people said, if passed, the legislation would contravene international human rights standards and put women's health at risk.
 It is a "blatant attempt to restrict women's access to abortion care," said Adriana Lamackova, legal adviser for Europe at the Centre for Reproductive Rights, a global legal advocacy organisation.
 The draft legislation requires two separate medical opinions from different institutions, instead of one at present, a change opponents say could make it harder for women to get an abortion - especially poorer women in rural areas.
 It also seeks to restrict the information that medical professionals can provide publicly about abortion services. Opponents said that would restrict doctors' ability to adequately inform women about the procedure.
 Women would also have to state their reasons for seeking an abortion and disclose other private information, which would be transferred to Slovakia's National Health Information Centre, a government body.
 "Requiring women seeking an abortion to state reasons for their decision - which is often a very personal and private matter - could deter women from seeking care within the formal health system," Lamackova said.
 Niki Kandirikirira, director of programmes for Equality Now, a women's rights NGO, said "medically unnecessary and onerous regulations" would ultimately restrict abortion access.
 Opponents said the push also reflects a trend towards more conservative social policies in parts of central Europe such as proposals to further tighten abortion rules in Poland and Hungary's ban on people changing their gender on ID documents.
 "This is an anti-abortion, right-wing trend following in the footsteps of Poland and it is dangerous," said Marge Berer, coordinator of the International Campaign for Women's Right to Safe Abortion.
 "There is concern that if they manage to get some restrictions, they'll keep trying more, as Poland has," she added.

Tampa Bay’s win in Game 7 of the ALCS late Saturday night wiped out the chance for an October rematch with the Astros, whose 2017 World Series victory over the Dodgers has been heavily tarnished by the revelations of Houston’s sign- stealing tactics that season.
 Betts, the first-year Dodger signed for 12 more years, made another incredible defensive play, robbing Freeman of a solo homer in the fifth. He had run- saving plays in all three of their potential elimination games.
 "This is really the first time we’ve had our backs against the wall,” Betts said. "It seemed like we were getting handled a little bit early on. We were able to get a hold of ourselves and fight back. We’re never going to give up."
 Urias, the fifth Dodgers pitcher, got his fourth win in four appearances this postseason. The 24-year-old right-hander, already in his fourth postseason, has a 0.57 ERA in these playoffs.
 "That’s his moment right there. That was his game to win and he went out there and did it,” Seager said.
 The massive shot to right by reigning NL MVP and 2018 NLCS MVP Bellinger came on a 94-mph (151 kph) sinker after fouling off three pitches in a row by Chris Martin, the fifth Braves pitcher who started the seventh with strikeouts of Max Muncy and Will Smith.
 Hernandez led off the sixth with a 424-foot (129-meter) drive to left-center off A.J. Minter.
 "Game 7 of the NLCS, win or go home, I was ready from first pitch of the game on. Mentally prepared, physically ready, envisioning AB situations,” Hernandez said.
 Dansby Swanson homered for Atlanta, which hasn't been to the World Series since 1999.
 Before the late drama, it was the first winner-take-all game in postseason history matching rookie starters.
 The Dodgers scored twice in the third to tie it at 2, the first runs allowed by Ian Anderson in his four postseason starts — the 22-year-old right-hander started only six games for Atlanta in the regular season. His scoreless streak of 17⅔ innings was the third-longest to start a postseason career.
 Justin Turner drew a two-out walk, Muncy doubled and Will Smith bounced a two- run single through the open gap near second that was created by the defensive shift.
 The Dodgers' Dustin May became the first pitcher to walk the first two batters in a winner-take-all-game — and the 23-year-old from nearby Justin, Texas, did so without throwing a strike to Ronald Acuna Jr. or Freeman. The Braves didn’t even swing at a pitch until Marcell Ozuna’s sharp single through the left side of the infield on an 0-1 curveball for a 1-0 lead.
 "We believed we should have been in the World Series,” Freeman said. "It’s just the Dodgers came, and they won three games in a row. I feel like you can hang your head high. We gave it everything we had.”

The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) had earlier banned the video- sharing app TikTok on October 9. File photo
 KARACHI: Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has reportedly been restored in Pakistan, it emerged on Monday.
 The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) had on October 9 banned TikTok for failing to filter out "immoral and indecent" content.
 The telecom regulator had said that the decision to ban the app was taken after the authority received a number of "complaints from different segments of the society against immoral and indecent content on the video sharing application.
 According to sources, the company has assured the authorities that it will take steps to control "indecent and immoral" on the app.
 The commitment was made in a meeting with PTA officials, after which the regulator unbanned the application.
 TikTok had on Saturday expressed disappointment that its users and creators in Pakistan were still unable to access the video-sharing platform despite the company's efforts to engage with the country's telecom regulator.  
 According to a TikTok spokesperson, the video-sharing app kept engaging with the PTA to demonstrate its commitment to comply with local laws and further enhance its content moderation capacity.  
 The spokesperson had said that TikTok had made “concerted efforts to address questions from the Pakistani government around their content moderation process”.
 “TikTok’s mission is to inspire creativity and joy, and that's just what we've done in Pakistan. We've built a community whose creativity and passion has brought joy to households across Pakistan and opened vital economic opportunities to incredibly talented creators,” it said.
 “We continue to hope that our productive dialogue with the PTA can bring assurance of the Government's commitment to a stable, enabling environment whereby we can explore investing further in the market, including in the inspiring talent we've seen thrive on TikTok.”

 “We are delighted to be working with MHI Vestas and Able UK delivering this new UK infrastructure, and we are looking forward to the first Triton Knoll components arriving at Seaton in the coming months, ready for installation to begin early next year.”
 Construction will be co-ordinated from the base on Grimsby’s Royal Dock - which will also be home to operations and maintenance - joining Orsted’s large portfolio and the early near-shore developments.
 Able Marine Energy Park on the Humber had been an early favourite for the project, but has yet to reach quay construction. Significant interest is again emerging now as the industry ramps up once more on the back of the Sector Deal and the Prime Minister’s recent target acceleration.

BEIJING (AP) — China said Monday that it has complained to Canada for allegedly condoning anti-China comments that appeared in Canadian media following controversial remarks made by the Chinese ambassador.
 Ties between the countries are at their lowest point in years amid China’s outrage over Canada’s detention of a top executive of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Last week, China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, branded pro- democracy protesters in Hong Kong as violent criminals and said if Canada grants them asylum it would amount to interference in China’s internal affairs.
 “If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport-holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,” Cong said in a video news conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.
 Cong was asked whether his remarks amounted to a threat, to which he replied, “That is your interpretation.”
 On Saturday, the Toronto Sun published an editorial calling on Cong to either apologize or leave Canada. “It’s not enough for the Trudeau government to publicly scold Cong," the paper said. “If he won’t apologize and retract his threats, boot him back to Beijing.”
 Cherie Wong, the executive director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong, a group that advocates for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, called Cong’s comment a “direct threat” to all Canadians.

BELOIT — The Beloit City Council will meet in closed session tonight to discuss the possibility of an agreement with the Town of Beloit for provisional sharing fire chief services with the Beloit Fire Department, according to the meeting’s agenda.
 Town of Beloit Fire Chief and Town Administrator Gene Wright announced his retirement in early September, prompting the town to begin exploring what the future holds for the department.
 Following Wright’s announcement, the township initially broached the idea of joining a collection of fire departments lead by the Janesville Fire Department. Janesville Chief Ernie Rhodes was interviewed last month in the wake of Wright’s retirement announcement.
 On Sept. 21, following additional negotiations between the town board, Wright said he has had discussions with multiple fire department leaders in the Rock County area—including the City of Beloit—in recent months and years, and that they share a belief that partnerships are critical to local fire service.
 Meanwhile, the City of Beloit has remained willing and open to discussions regarding shared services with the township, with Monday’s closed session meeting potentially marking a turning point for shared emergency services with the township if an agreement is reached.
 Last month, Beloit Fire Chief Dan Pease and Wright both touted a new dispatching system implemented in January that allows for the closest department to a given fire or emergency medical call to respond, essentially removing service borders for departments in Rock County.
 Both Pease and Wright could not be reached for comment regarding the possible agreement as of press time Sunday.
 In other business, the council will hold public hearings on the city’s proposed 2021 operating, block grant and affordable housing budgets that could come before the council on Nov. 2 for possible action. Councilors also could take action to approve a Beloit Transit System (BTS) wavier of all bus fares between Oct. 26 and Nov. 3 to allow riders to explore the system’s new routes that begin on Oct. 26 and were approved by the council on Sept. 21.
 In development-related news, the council will review and send a plan by OrthoIllinois to the Beloit Plan Commission regarding the medical provider’s plan to build a 25,605 square-foot orthopedic, outpatient surgery center with ambulatory services and four lodging suites for recovery on a 5.6-acre property located at 1350 Gateway Blvd.
