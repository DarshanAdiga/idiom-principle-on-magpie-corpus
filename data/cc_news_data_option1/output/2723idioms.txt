Fernandes had been registering on their radar for some time, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer finally making the decision to take the plunge.
 A sizeable show of faith, and funds, has been richly rewarded with the 25-year-old’s performances so far.
 Fernandes has quickly become a talisman for United in the heart of their midfield, contributing eight goals and seven assists to the collective cause while helping himself to two Premier League Player of the Month awards.
 Few could have predicted that his impact would be so immediate, or so impressive.
 United are, however, eager to see a man who has already become a firm fan favourite take his game to even greater heights in the months and years to come.
 Fernandes believes he is capable of doing just that, but is eager to point out that not everything he tries is going to come off as he likes to play on the edge.
 He told _Sky Sports_ of the impression he has made in Manchester and the qualities he offers to Solskjaer’s side: “I feel proud from the team, because I think one player can change everything a lot.
 “Of course I help the team. The team was good before because no team can be so good now and so bad in the past, you know. It’s not about this, it’s about confidence, it’s about results.
 “We have such good qualities on the team, so for the position I play, having players in front who can score, who can get a lot of goals, is easier for me.
 “I’m a risk player, I take risks. I want to take risks every time and I will take the risk every time.
 “I will lose a lot of balls, I will misplace a lot of passes but I know when I find my strikers, my wingers, they will score.

Norwich were condemned to a record fifth relegation from the Premier League as Michail Antonio's four-goal blitz fired West Ham to a 4-0 win at Carrow Road on Saturday.
 A seventh successive league defeat for Daniel Farke's side sealed their fate as Antonio's ruthless display boosted West Ham's own survival bid.
 Norwich are 13 points from safety with only three games left, meaning they are certain to make an immediate return to the Championship after last season's promotion campaign.
 The Canaries have become accustomed to relegation in the Premier League era, going down on four previous occasions in 1995, 2005, 2014 and 2016.
 Farke was already resigned to relegation before this weekend given Norwich had lost every game since the coronavirus hiatus.
 "We wanted to beat the odds again but when the dust settles the outcome is more or less what was expected. It doesn't take anything away from the fact that we are disappointed," Farke said.
 "From the first day after promotion our chances to survive were perhaps 5 percent so in 19 out of 20 cases you will go down. If you have luck and no injuries then you have a chance.
 "When we are 100 percent we are competitive but when it's 96 or 97 percent then it sometimes looks like men against boys. That's what I expected."
 With all games being played behind closed doors, some Norwich fans might have been relieved not to have to watch the embarrassment of their limp demise in person.
 In truth, they have looked out of their depth among the Premier League elite from the moment they paid the price for a naively attacking game-plan in a 4-1 defeat at Liverpool on the opening day of the season.
 Farke was hamstrung by Norwich's decision not to spend big money on new signings following their promotion.
 Since Teemu Pukki's early-season goal rush dried up, they have been on a relentless slide towards the Championship.
 A 3-2 win over Manchester City was a rare highlight but just weeks later a 5-1 home defeat against Aston Villa underlined the problems undermanned Norwich would endure all season.
 Norwich face losing promising youngsters Todd Cantwell and Max Aarons to Premier League clubs when the transfer window opens.
 West Ham's second win in four games was a huge lift to their hopes of staying up.
 David Moyes' side are six points above the bottom three with three games left against Watford, Manchester United and Aston Villa.
 The early signs were ominous for Norwich as West Ham took the lead in the 11th minute.
 Arriving to meet Issa Diop's flick from Jarrod Bowen's corner, Antonio volleyed into the roof of the net from close-range for his third goal in his last four games.
 Norwich were surrendering with a whimper and Antonio pushed them closer to the relegation trap door in first half stoppage-time.
 Rising above the meek challenge of two Norwich defenders, Antonio glanced his header into the far corner from Mark Noble's free-kick.
 Antonio was proving unplayable for the leaky Norwich rearguard and he completed his hat-trick in the 54th minute, looping a header into the net after Tim Krul saved his initial effort.
 Antonio completed a memorable personal performance with his fourth goal in the 74th minute, coolly finishing from Ryan Fredericks' cross.
 Troy Deeney scored two penalties as Watford improved their survival prospect with a 2-1 win against Newcastle at Vicarage Road.
 Newcastle snatched the lead in the 23rd minute when Matt Ritchie's corner was flicked on by Federico Fernandez and Dwight Gayle bundled home at the far post for his third goal of the season.
 But Deeney pulled Watford level seven minutes after the restart.
 Kiko Femenia was clipped inside the area by Ritchie and Deeney smashed the penalty past Martin Dubravka.
 In the 82nd minute, Javier Manquillo brought down Ismaila Sarr and Deeney stepped up again to bury his second penalty.
 Fourth bottom Watford are now six points clear of third bottom Bournemouth, who face Leicester on Sunday.
 Second bottom Aston Villa are seven points adrift of safety before Sunday's clash with Crystal Palace.

Super Rugby club the Golden Lions have intensified competition for the tighthead prop position by resigning former Springbok Ruan Dreyer from Gloucester.
 The forward capped four times by South Africa in 2017 will compete with another former Springbok, Jannie du Plessis, and young Carlu Sadie for the No. 3 shirt.
 After returning this year following four seasons with Montpellier, veteran Du Plessis failed to make the expected impact, particularly at scrums.
 This opened the door for much younger Sadie, who moved to the Lions from fellow Super Rugby side the Western Stormers, to stake a starting place.
 Now, the competition will become even more intense as the Lions prepare to resume playing once South Africa Rugby gets the green light from government amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 There is hope that a domestic Super Rugby competition including the Lions, Stormers, Northern Bulls and Coastal Sharks can kick-off not later than August.
 The Central Cheetahs and Southern Kings, who play in the predominantly European Pro14 competition after being ditched from Super Rugby, may also take part.
 Dreyer helped the Johannesburg-based Lions become one of the dominant forces in the southern hemisphere before moving to England two years ago.
 His appearances in a Gloucester team under former Lions coach Johan Ackermann were limited by injuries, including a ruptured achilles tendon.
 The Lions have also hired speedster Rabz Maxwane, a winger who joined from the Cheetahs after previous stints with the Stormers and Bulls.
 Coach Ivan van Rooyen hopes the arrival of Maxwane can help compensate for the loss of exciting utility back Tyrone Green, who many pundits believe is a future Springbok.
 Green, who can operate at full-back or on the wing, has moved to English Premiership outfit Harlequins.

Sebastian Vettel admitted Ferrari are struggling to keep pace with their rivals after he qualified 10th ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc for Sunday's Styrian Grand Prix.
 The four-time world champion, who is being released by the Italian team at the end of this season, had been encouraged by the performance of Ferrari's upgrades on Friday, but said he was disappointed with their wet weather set- up.
 "It was a difficult session for us," he said.
 "We struggled to get the tyres to work and now we have to have a good look to see why. I had lots of aquaplaning in particular at the end of Q2 and in Q3 as well.
 "So not ideal. We need to make sure we learn the maximum we can from this session and take it into the next wet session.
 "Tomorrow should be dry which is a bit different. We fight and try everything we can tomorrow."
 Leclerc, who had finished a fortunate second in last Sunday's season-opening Austrian Grand Prix, failed to make the cut to the top-ten shootout in intense rain at the Red Bull Ring circuit.
 "Unfortunately, we had the rain when we went on the second set (of tyres)," said Leclerc.
 "But the main problem was that we were just not quick enough. There was just not much we could do.
 "We were 1.8 off. However, we look at it, we are just too slow at the moment. We just need to work."

Liverpool's bid to set a new Premier League points record was rocked by a 1-1 draw against Burnley, while Norwich were relegated as Michail Antonio's four- goal blitz fired West Ham to a thumping win on Saturday.
 Jurgen Klopp's side are chasing the record total of 100 points set by Manchester City in 2018, but the champions have no margin for error after being held at Anfield for the first time this season.
 They have 93 points and need to win their remaining three matches against Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle to break City's record.
 They would tie the 100-point mark if they win two and draw one of those matches.
 Liverpool took the lead when Andrew Robertson met Fabinho's lofted pass with a powerful header in the 34th minute.
 But they wasted chances to increase their lead, with Roberto Firmino hitting the post before Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah fired wide.
 They were made to pay for those misses in the 69th minute.
 Liverpool were unhinged by a long free-kick into their area as James Tarkowski's header found Jay Rodriguez, who drilled a superb low strike past Alisson Becker.
 Johann Berg Gudmundsson almost won it for Burnley when he hit the bar in the final minutes.
 It was the first time Liverpool had failed to win a home league game since January 2019.

 Daniel Farke's side are 13 points from safety with only three games left, meaning they are certain to make an immediate return to the Championship after last season's promotion campaign.

En una carta enviada a Trump, la llamada Coalición por el Sueño Americano, que incluye más de 140 asociaciones comerciales y empresas como Google, Amazon, General Motors, Apple o Hilton, le recomiendan que no cambie ni cancele el programa Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA).“Como grandes empleadores y organizaciones de empleadores estadounidenses le recomendamos encarecidamente que deje en su sitio DACA”, dicen los empresarios sobre este amparo que da permisos temporales de residencia y trabajo a jóvenes que llegaron al país ilegalmente siendo niños.El grupo, que incluye a la Cámara de Comercio de EE. UU. y varios grupos empresariales de diversos sectores, aseguran que los beneficiarios de DACA son “miembros críticos” de la fuerza laboral y sociedad, y recuerdan que para poder mantener el amparo migratorio durante años han “cumplido con las leyes y regulaciones” del país.“No es momento de interrumpir la recuperación económica de nuestras empresas y comunidades, ni de poner en peligro la salud y la seguridad de estas personas vulnerables. Le pedimos que no toque DACA y se abstenga de tomar medidas administrativas adicionales que impacten negativamente DACA”, se lee en la misiva.La Coalición por el Sueño Americano, que dice representar a más de la mitad de los trabajadores del sector privado de EE. UU., recuerda que no sería un buen momento para cancelar DACA, como ha insistido Trump en varias ocasiones en los últimos años, porque hay miles de amparados que trabajan como personal sanitario y en otros sectores esenciales en la lucha contra la COVID-19. TAMBIÉN TE PUEDE INTERESAR Trump tiene 91 % de posibilidad de reelegirse; suena loco, pero lo dice 'profe infalible' “No estamos haciendo un buen trabajo”, dice asesor Anthony Fauci, y Trump le cae encima Bolsonaro anula obligación del gobierno de darles a indígenas agua potable y camas UCI EE. UU. confiscó 81 camionetas de lujo que iban de contrabando a Venezuela Este programa, creado en 2012 por el entonces presidente Barack Obama para proteger de la deportación a cerca de un millón de “dreamers”, tiene un amplio apoyo entre la sociedad estadounidense, incluido entre el 69 % de los votantes conservadores, según un reciente informe del Centro Pew.Aun así, el Gobierno anunció en 2017 la cancelación del programa, lo que desató una batalla judicial que concluyó en junio pasado cuando el Tribunal Supremo desechó como “arbitraria y caprichosa” la decisión de Trump añadiendo que el Ejecutivo no había presentado argumentos que justificaran la terminación del programa.Tras este revés, Trump dijo que presentarían próximamente los documentos requeridos por el Alto Tribunal para cerrar este programa.Pero este viernes el presidente dio un giro a su discurso y dijo a la cadena Telemundo que aprobará una “amplia reforma migratoria” a través de una orden ejecutiva que ofrecerá una vía a la ciudadanía para estos jóvenes.“Voy a hacer una gran orden ejecutiva … y voy a hacer que DACA sea parte de ella”, dijo Trump. “Vamos a tener un camino hacia la ciudadanía”.Este anuncio ha generado críticas entre el propio Partido Republicano, como el senador Ted Cruz, quien dijo que el presidente carece de “autoridad constitucional” para crear un “camino hacia la ciudadanía” por orden ejecutiva y sería un “ENORME error si Trump intenta expandir ilegalmente la amnistía”.Posteriormente, un portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Judd Deere, aclaró que esta iniciativa en la que están trabajando no incluye una “amnistía” y estará basada en el mérito e incluirá una “fuerte seguridad fronteriza”.“El presidente ha dicho durante mucho tiempo que está dispuesto a trabajar con el Congreso en una solución legislativa para DACA, una que podría incluir la ciudadanía, junto con una fuerte seguridad fronteriza y reformas permanentes basadas en el mérito”, dijo Deere en un comunicado publicado a última hora del viernes con el que intentaba aclarar las declaraciones de Trump.“Esto no incluye la amnistía. Desafortunadamente, los demócratas han rechazado continuamente estas ofertas ya que se oponen a cualquier otra cosa que no sea fronteras totalmente abiertas”.

United States Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart hopes the threatened withdrawal of US government funding from the World Anti-Doping Agency could force the global watchdog into long-called for reforms.
 The prospect of the United States halting its annual $2.7 million payment to WADA edged closer to becoming reality this week after the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) received authorisation to halt WADA funding from a key US congressional committee.
 The authorisation came just weeks after an explosive ONDCP report which recommended withholding US funding from WADA if the agency failed to implement governance reforms.
 WADA subsequently rejected the ONDCP's assessment in a strongly-worded rebuttal, accusing it of containing "multiple inaccuracies, misconceptions and falsehoods."
 USADA chief, however, Tygart has defended the ONDCP's summary, describing it as "absolutely accurate...it paints a realistic, non-political picture."
 "The ONDCP asked for athletes to be given a voice, independence at the table with the removal of sports federations from the governance side, and then fair representation," Tygart told AFP.
 "What's great is that the United States is clearly serious about reform and is willing to seek authority from Congress to withhold the money. That would have a devastating impact on WADA. Nobody wants that to happen.
 "But the promises of reform have been unfulfilled. Athletes are frustrated and governments who are paying attention are frustrated."
 The director of the ONDCP, James Carroll, sent a letter to WADA President Witold Banka on July 6, reiterating that US authorities were serious about stopping funds in the absence of reform.
 "It is my hope that it does not come to this and instead we can find a way to work together to improve the integrity of international athletic competitions for the benefit of all athletes and countries," Carroll wrote.
 \- 'Failed system' -
 Tygart said USADA was prepared to face the consequences if WADA responded to any future funding withdrawal by expelling the US agency from its ranks.
 "We don't what that to happen. We want a strong independent WADA. But WADA made it clear in its response that they're going to retaliate if the money stops and they're going to kick US out of WADA," Tygart said.
 "At the end of the day, the US doesn't have a seat on the (WADA) executive committee so it's not going to matter. We hope they don't do something else to us such as open up a non-compliance claim.
 "But there's no real loss because we don't have representation as things stand today."
 USADA has long been critical of the influence of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in WADA's corridors of power, believing that the presence of so many IOC members in key positions prevents the global agency from acting independently.
 The IOC, which contributes half of WADA's funding, also has half of the seats on the agency's powerful executive committee, which has no representation from the United States.
 "You can't promote and police effectively at the same time," Tygart said.
 "It's common sense. You don't have the mafia kingpin sitting on the police board, for obvious reasons."
 Tygart said a recent investigation by Richard McLaren into the International Weightlifting Federation, whose former president Tamas Ajan was forced to step down following allegations of corruption, vote-buying and covering up positive drug cases, was proof of the need to reform.
 "That all happened on WADA's watch. McLaren paints a picture of a failed system," Tygart said. "And those of us who care want to see it fixed."
 Tygart meanwhile is sceptical of recent initiatives by WADA president Banka to boost engagement with athletes. Banka, a former 400m runner from Poland who took over as WADA chief in January, has launched a series of meetings with individual athletes and athlete groups.
 "They're throwing some crumbs off the king's table," Tygart said. "'We'll meet with the athletes and we'll put athletes on the agenda.' It's a delay tactic. And that's how they play the game."

Lazio's title dream suffered yet another setback on Saturday as Francesco Caputo's injury-time header grabbed Sassuolo a 2-1 victory at the Stadio Olimpico to hand Juventus the chance to move 10 points clear at the Serie A summit.
 The midweek loss at lowly Lecce appeared to signal the end of Lazio's title challenge, but Juve's implosion en route to a 4-2 defeat by AC Milan kept the gap at only seven points.
 But a third straight loss for Lazio means that when Juve host in-form Atalanta later on Saturday, Juve could either stretch their lead or the Bergamo outfit could climb into second.
 Lazio were only one point behind Juventus when the Italian top flight resumed following the coronavirus lockdown, but they have been beaten four times in six matches since.
 Atalanta, on a winning streak of 11 games in all competitions, could cut the gap to Juve to six points if they beat the Turin giants at the Allianz Stadium.
 A fourth successive league win for Sassuolo boosted their European hopes as they moved within three points of seventh-placed Milan, who occupy the final possible Europa League spot.
 Hosts Lazio survived an early scare when Sassuolo striker Giacomo Raspadori was denied an early goal for offside.
 But Simone Inzaghi's men grabbed the lead against the run of play 12 minutes before half-time as Alberto's blocked shot bounced back off his shin and looped into the top corner.
 It was the former Liverpool midfielder's seventh goal of the season in all competitions.
 But Sassuolo continued to be the better side and deservedly levelled seven minutes into the second period as Mehdi Bourabia won the ball high up the pitch and fed Caputo, who squared for the 20-year-old Raspadori to cap his first Serie A start with a simple tap-in.
 Lazio rarely looked like grabbing an all-important victory, with centre-back Bastos coming closest to a late winner for the home side when he headed over as the capital club finished the match with just one shot on target.
 They always looked vulnerable at the back, though, and Caputo pounced to nod home in the second minute of injury-time after the Lazio defence fell apart after failing to clear a corner.

Big money has been spent trying to plug leaks, with the likes of Shkodran Mustafi, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and David Luiz brought on board.
 Arsenal have also invested in Germany international goalkeeper Bernd Leno and highly-rated Scottish full-back Kieran Tierney.
 They remain a work in progress, with more funds likely to be required in future windows, but Arteta is eager to point out that his footballing philosophy is built around a watertight backline.
 “Yes, absolutely,” he told _Sky Sports_.
 “If you want to be successful and you want to win every three days, you have to be very consistent in all the defensive work that you do.
 “The more clean sheets you get, the easier it is to win football matches.”
 Arteta, who is filling the first managerial post of a promising coaching career, is also looking to get everyone at Arsenal pulling in the same direction.
 He has offered cause for optimism through the early months of his reign, but wants belief to start surging through the club once more.
 “I am a big believer that a culture that is implemented has a big reflection in what happens on the pitch and the success of a football club,” he added.
 “If we are not all on the same page and things start to shift a little bit, we are going to have issues.
 “We are trying to set very clear expectations of what we need, how our culture needs to be and live together in a better way.”
 Certain players are considered to have fallen short of those standards of late, with Mesut Ozil and Matteo Guendouzi finding themselves left out of Premier League plans, but Arteta is reluctant to write anybody off
