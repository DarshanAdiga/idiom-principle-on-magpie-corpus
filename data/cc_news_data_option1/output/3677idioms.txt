BERLIN (AP) — Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny posted a picture of himself from his hospital bed in Germany on Tuesday, looking gaunt but joking wryly about his condition and saying that he was enjoying the ability to finally breathe on his own after being poisoned with a nerve agent.The Instagram post was the first image of the 44-year-old released since he was taken to Berlin’s Charite hospital two days after falling ill on a domestic flight in Russia on Aug. 20. “Hi, this is Navalny,” he wrote in the Russian-language post. “I have been missing you. I still can’t do almost anything on my own, but yesterday I managed to breathe on my own for the entire day.”Navalny had been kept in an induced coma for more than two weeks as he was treated with an antidote before hospital officials said on Sept. 7 that his condition had improved enough for him to be brought out of it.On Monday, the hospital said he had been removed from mechanical ventilation and was able to leave his bed for “short periods of time.”In the photo, Navalny is being given a hug by his wife Yulia and is flanked by his two children as he sits upright in his bed in a hospital gown, and his statement even had the ring of his well-known sarcastic humor.“Just on my own, no extra help, I didn’t even use the simplest valve in my throat,” he said of being able to breathe without ventilation. “I liked it very much. It’s a remarkable process that is underestimated by many. Strongly recommended.”Despite his recovery, doctors have said they cannot rule out long-term health issues associated with the poisoning. Leonid Volkov, a top associate of Navalny, refused to give any details on his condition or possible plans after his recovery when reached by The Associated Press on Tuesday.A German military lab has determined that Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, the same class of Soviet-era agent that Britain said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018. On Monday, the German government said independent tests by labs in France and Sweden backed up its findings.The Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons also is taking steps to have samples from Navalny tested at its designated labs, Germany has said. The Kremlin has bristled at calls from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders to answer questions about the poisoning, denying any official involvement.French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said he had expressed “deep concern over the criminal act” that targeted Navalny directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. The Kremlin said Putin in the call “underlined the impropriety of unfounded accusations against the Russian side” and emphasized Russia’s demand for Germany to hand over analyses and samples. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday that Russia is puzzled by the German refusal to share Navalny’s analyses and other medical data, or compare notes with the Russian doctors who found no trace of poison in his system while he was at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk.“Russia has been absolutely open for cooperation in determining what happened,” Peskov said. “Russia needs cooperation with the German side in getting the patient’s biological samples to be able to advance.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who has canceled a scheduled trip Tuesday to Berlin, said Russian authorities have conducted a preliminary inquiry and documented the meetings Navalny had before falling ill, but he emphasized they need to see the evidence of his poisoning to launch a full criminal investigation.Lavrov charged that Navalny’s life was saved by the pilots of the plane who quickly landed in the Siberian city of Omsk when he collapsed on board and by the rapid action of doctors there. He accused the West of trying to smear Russia and use the incident as a pretext for new sanctions against Moscow.Berlin has rejected suggestions from Moscow that it is dragging its heels on sharing evidence.With Germany’s findings corroborated by labs abroad, “we do not expect the bringer of the bad news — namely us — to be attacked further, but rather that they should deal with the news itself,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Monday of Russian authorities.Asked why no samples from Navalny have been given to Russia, his spokeswoman noted that “Mr. Navalny was in Russian treatment in a hospital for 48 hours.”Most of Germany’s political parties have joined Merkel in calling for an investigation, but leaders in the far-right Alternative for Germany, known for its pro-Russian sympathies, have said Berlin should not be involved. On Tuesday it invited media to a discussion with a Russian parliamentarian on “the Russian view of the Navalny case.”___Isachenkov reported from Moscow.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Responses to this ecclesial request accused church leaders of irresponsibility. Monash University head of microbiology Professor Stephen Turner told the _Sydney Morning Herald_ that the human embryonic kidney 293 cells used in the Oxford vaccine research had been widely used in research for decades. “They’re not collecting recent fetal tissue and using those. These are cell lines that have been around for years,” he said. In other words, don’t worry, the female baby was killed a long time ago, and we’ve normalized using her biological remains for science, so no big deal. In a similar vein, Peter Doherty, Nobel laureate and professor of immunology, said that “scientifically there’s no issue…. It’s our perfect right to take absolutely no intelligence of him” (Archbishop Fisher, that is). Because scientific progress is _de facto_ synonymous with ethics?

On March 31, Mrs Reid contacted Ms Bennett and offered to return to work immediately and that she would only be limited by the restrictions which impacted others in the community.
 She told the tribunal Ms Bennett “reacted negatively and rejected this, saying she had no other choice” but to dismiss her.
 After contacting the Manx Industrial Relations Service, she asked Ms Bennet to explain her employment status and was told the company considered her to have resigned.
 Mrs Reid was asked why she had wanted to isolate when there were no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the island, but wanted to return when this had risen to 49 cases.
 Mrs Reid said she “had acted in accordance with the medical advice from her doctor” and had shown no signs of the virus and felt okay.
 She told the court that she hadn’t intended to go to a tribunal until she was advised to by her friends and family.
 She said the experience had left her “scared to go back out to look for work”.
 She added: “I want this to go public as I don’t want this to happen to someone else. If someone else is in the position I was, then fight it.”

 Same was the case for silver where it tested $27.75 on the upside and a low of $25.98 per ounce.

Das Reeperbahn Festival in Hamburg ist das größte Clubfestival Europas. Wegen der Coronavirus-Pandemie sind bei der 15. Auflage vom 16. bis 19. September deutlich weniger Künstlerinnen und Künstler als gewohnt dabei - dennoch gilt es rund hundert Bands und Musik-Acts zu entdecken. Die Vielfalt ist groß, fast alle Genres sind vertreten. Da es keine Einlassgarantie für die Konzerte gibt, ist es ratsam, sich immer auch einen Plan B oder C zu überlegen - aufgrund der Corona-Auflagen ist dies umso wichtiger. NDR.de hat sich durch das Musikprogramm gehört und gibt Tipps. (Hinweis: Viele Künstler treten an verschiedenen Tagen auf und tauchen deshalb auch mehrmals auf.) Zahlreiche Konzerte übertragen wir im Stream - eine Übersicht finden Sie hier.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s Netflix deal sent shockwaves to the British royal family and landed them in hot water.
 According to the latest intel, it has been reported that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had been making attempts to secure commercial deals since way before they had stepped down as senior members of the family.
 Acclaimed royal author Lady Colin Campbell, who has written _Meghan and Harry: The Real Story_ , claims that the couple tried to get their hands on commercial deal long before their departure but were forced to stop by the royals.
 “Some of the commercial deals I heard of were laughable. I thought there is no way the Royal Family can agree to this,” she said while talking to Daily Star.
 She went on to say that it was the former actor who was taking the lead in their efforts to resign as members of the family and seek financial independence.
 “Meghan was cutting a swathe through Harry’s social life, she didn’t approve of this, she didn’t approve of that, she is an operator,” said Lady C, adding that the hostility between Meghan and the rest of the members began only days after she married into the family.
 Lady C further added how it was unacceptable to Queen Elizabeth that the couple would want to cash in on their royal status, which is why they eventually called it quits.
 “You have to remember, to be in the Royal Family, to be a member of the monarchy, you have to be above politics and commerce, otherwise it is perceived to not be neutral, and it has to be neutral, to represent the country you have to be neutral,” she said.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany says it is providing up to 750 million euros ($892 million) to support three domestic pharmaceutical companies that are developing vaccines against the new coronavirus. Science Minister Anja Karliczek said Tuesday that the government has already agreed to provide BioNTech and CureVac with 375 million euros and 230-million euros respectively to develop their mRNA-based vaccines. Talks with a third company, IDT Biologika, are expected to conclude soon, she said. The company is developing a vector-based vaccine that delivers a coronavirus protein into cells to stimulate the body’s immune response. The agreement with the three companies, which is tied to specific milestones, would guarantee Germany 40 million doses of vaccine. The amount comes on top of other vaccine supply agreements concluded through the European Union, of which Germany is a member. Karliczek said Germany wouldn't cut corners when it comes to testing vaccines, meaning most of the population may have to wait until mid-2021 to be inoculated. “Safety is an absolute priority,” she said. Health Minister Jens Spahn echoed that stance, saying that only vaccines which have been tested on \"thousands, ideally many thousands of volunteers in phase 3” would be approved. Spahn complained that reports from Russia and China about vaccines being developed in the two countries “aren't always such that one feels there's absolute transparency.” Spahn dismissed suggestions that Germany might consider making COVID-19 vaccinations compulsory. “We need 55-60% of the population to be vaccinated,\" he said. “I’m firmly convinced we will achieve this voluntarily.” Spahn added that Germany also doesn't intend to hoard vaccines. “I'm happy to give other countries in the world some of...

William T. Huncik June 25, 1930-September 11, 2020 William T. Huncik, 90, of Pulaski, PA was welcomed into Heaven on September 11, 2020 at his home with his loving family by his side. Born on June 25, 1930 in Campbell, Ohio he was the son of the late Albert and Nellie (Malarchik) Huncik. On May 21, 1955 Bill married his beloved wife, the former Patricia Ann Meenihan. She preceded him in death on November 29, 2009. Bill was an electrician by trade and had worked for various manufacturing companies.

He was a member of St. James the Apostle Church where he served for a time as an eucharistic minister. Bill was a quiet man of few words, who when he spoke it was always something to listen to. He was a jack of all trades. You could often find him sitting in his rocker on his front porch. Bill enjoyed being in the outdoors gardening and riding his Gator. He also enjoyed riding and watching trains. A loving father and grandfather Bill's greatest joy was the time he spent with his family. Bill is survived by his children, Bernadine Kulijof (Jeffrey) of Raleigh, NC, Barbara Pagan (Al) of Pittsburgh, PA, Carol Huncik of Pulaski, PA, Margaret Kurucz (John) of Lancaster, OH, Mark Huncik (Elisa) of State College, PA, Norene DeLuca (Bill) of Pittsburgh, PA, Kevin Huncik (Kara) of Charleston, SC, his brother, George Huncik of Pulaski, PA and seven grandchildren, Anthony Kulijof, Amanda Kulijof, Katie Pagan, Noah Kurucz, Larissa Kurucz, Anastasia Huncik, Olivia DeLuca and Liam Huncik. In addition to his parents and wife, Bill was preceded in death by his first-born son, William Huncik. A private service will be held at the Ed &amp; Don DeCarbo Funeral Home &amp; Crematory, 3000 Wilmington Road. Father Joseph McCaffrey will officiate. Burial will be in St. James Cemetery. In lieu of flowers the family suggests donations may be made in his name to Holy Spirit Parish. Online condolences may be offered to the family at www.decarbofuneralhome.com.

 Desert Island Discs host Lauren Laverne makes the top 10 for the first time, with more than £395,000.
 Broadcaster Stephen Nolan is on over £390,000 for his radio work, including 5 Live.
 The BBC previously opposed the publication of salaries as a "poacher's charter", but then-boss Lord Hall later said he welcomed the "transparency".
 The salaries are being published amid questions about how the BBC will be funded in future.
 The licence fee model is guaranteed until December 31 2027, the end of the current charter.
 Decriminalisation of licence fee evasion could also be on the cards - but the BBC has warned that switching to a civil system would cost the broadcaster more than £200 million a year.

Over the top specs generally don't mean much if you don't have good thermals to back it up, especially in an ultra-thin gaming laptop. But we are pleased to say that Asus has equipped the Zephyrus with an excellent cooling system to back up those over-the-top specs. The new Zephyrus S17 features six heat pipes, while both the CPU and GPU connect to both shared and dedicated heat sinks. Additionally, Asus has used the Thermal Grizzly liquid metal compound as opposed to the standard thermal paste. We didn't experience any sort of throttling while CPU temperature rarely rose above 80-percent.

“Now is not the time to be asking for more money from our families as they are struggling to make ends meet from the COVID crisis,” she said. “We cannot continue to raise taxes, we can’t print more money and have to have a balanced budget. What we need to do is go back and look at what the function of government is. We need to examine and audit each of our programs and make sure they align to the essential function of government and that there is no corruption, there is no wasteful spending, and that there is no fraud because we know that there have been accounts of that and that is not a good way that we spend our tax money. We are not accountable to the taxpayers when we are using their money inappropriately. There are millions of dollars that have been wasted in previous years and we need to make sure that is stopped and that we are able to go back to what we’re supposed to be doing as a government and our core functions so that we can govern effectively without raising taxes.”
