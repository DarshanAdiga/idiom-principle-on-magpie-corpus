There are more than 667,000 veterans living in North Carolina, and about 43,870 in Cumberland County. That's 6.4 percent of our statewide population and nearly 13.2 percent of our county.
   
 What many people don't know, however, is that most of those veterans rely predominantly on VA health insurance for their medical needs - but it doesn't cover dental care unless the veteran is 100% disabled, has a service-related mouth injury, or was a prisoner of war. This means thousands of veterans in our community aren't getting the dental care they need.
   
 As a local dentist and current captain serving in the U.S. Army Reserves, I am committed to addressing this issue. So, on March 10, I participated in Aspen Dental's MouthMobile tour. The MouthMobile is a dental office on wheels that makes about 30 stops each year giving veterans free dental care.
   
 Since Aspen Dental's first office opened in North Carolina just last year, the MouthMobile has visited the state twice now. During this year's stop in Fayetteville, my team and I volunteered our time to donate $7,491 in free care to local veterans. It was such a satisfying experience to serve our community by giving back to veterans, who have sacrificed a great deal for us.
   
 These kinds of programs are critical to the well-being of our community, because a lack of basic dental care can cause serious health repercussions. An unhealthy mouth can significantly increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, diabetes and even cancer. Many of the veterans we saw at the event were in serious pain, and we were able to change their lives.
   
 Since 2014, Aspen Dental teams have donated more than $22 million in free care to more than 27,000 veterans and people in need, nationally. This stop kicked off our 2020 Healthy Mouth Movement tour, and we are excited to continuing to raise the bar for community service in cities across the country.
   
 I hope that an increased awareness of the issues veterans face will inspire more dental practices to create similar programs that give back. I want to make dental care something that veterans - and all members of our community - don't have to worry about. Because programs like Aspen Dental's don't just benefit our collective health, they define our character. They make us all better.

Most Indian engineering colleges and business schools will have limited impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the ongoing sessions, as most of them have already completed their placements and are in the lean period. However, several of them have already put in place a temporary stop on the arrival of foreign faculty who come in to teach in their full-time flagship programmes as well as executive education programmes, even before the government on Thursday imposed curbs on travel for foreigners coming into India until April 15. Leading institutions such as IIM-Ahmedabad, IIM- Kozhikode, IIM-Indore, IIM-Trichy, Bhavan’s SP Jain Institute of Management & Research (SPJIMR), IIT-Bombay, IIT-Kanpur are introducing measures including postponing of events and large gatherings, imposing travel restrictions and holding extensive awareness generation sessions on campus about the outbreak. “We have stopped foreign faculty who come in to teach in our full-time MBA programmes from coming for the time being till we have more knowledge about the situation,” said Preobroto Ganguly, the head of human resources at Bhavan’s SPJIMR. We have also stopped domestic and international travel for faculty … apart from that, we have put a hold on our short-term modular programmes like executive education programmes,” he added. 74622020 At IIT- Kharagpur, the foreign faculty arrived at the campus late December and early January. “They have already passed the 21-day quarantine period and after that no one has come in,” said a spokesperson. IIM-Kozhikode in Kerala, which has reported a higher number of cases than the other parts of India, has postponed its convocation scheduled on April 4 and so has IIM-Ahmedabad and IIMIndore. Others like SPJIMR, which have their convocations coming up over the next few weeks, are also likely to postpone it. “We have postponed our convocation scheduled for April 4 and also putting on hold our executive education programmes till we are surer about the situation,” IIM-Kozhikode director Debashis Chatterjee said. IIM-Ahmedabad is organising awareness programmes for students and faculty. “Students, hostel wardens, administrative departments and faculty are proactively attempting to handle the situation,” said an official from the institute. As a preventive measure, IIT Delhi has suspended all the academic, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. The students have been asked to leave the hostel by March 15, 2020 midnight by IIT Delhi. While the older IIMs have already completed their placements in January and February, some of the newer ones like Nagpur and Trichy, which are in the process of wrapping it up, said there had been no negative impact on the placement process. “The impact of the Covid-19 is minimum at the campuses,” said Bhimaraya Metri, Director of IIM-Trichy. “The placement process is rolling in nature at our institute. Summer placements start in the month of September and final placements start in the month of November,” said Metri. The IITs, including Bombay, Kharagpur and Kanpur, which have completed their placements in January, said they too were monitoring the situation closely and taking appropriate measures. IIT-Kanpur deputy director Manindra Agrawal said the institute would take a decision by Friday on classroom teaching.

OMAHA, Neb. -- The cancellation of the NCAA basketball tournaments shook the nation Thursday, March 12, but more than two dozen other men's and women's championships won't be contested this winter and spring, either -- and that doesn't include all the sports in Divisions II and III.
   
 The biggest of those events is baseball's College World Series, which will not be held for the first time since 1946.
   
 Omaha has hosted the baseball championship every year since 1950. The CWS has a $70 million annual impact on the local economy each year and produces some 10 days of programming inventory for ESPN. This year's CWS was scheduled for June 13-24.
   
 "Devastating. Stunning," UCLA coach John Savage said. "I feel for all the players. I feel for the coaches. I feel for all the programs that work so hard through the fall and January, and to have such a decision to go down so quickly is just really hard to imagine. I feel for the seniors across the country. It's just a really, really sad day."
   
 The eight-team College World Series is held each year at TD Ameritrade Park and is the culmination of the Division I baseball tournament, the No. 2 revenue producer for the NCAA. The event draws more than 300,000 fans per year from across the country and is one of Omaha's most anticipated events of the year.
   
 NCAA President Mark Emmert and the Board of Governors canceled the Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments as well as all remaining winter and spring NCAA championships because of the public health threat posed by the spread of the new coronavirus.
   
 For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus.
   
 Huge crowd expected
   
 The wrestling championships were to be held March 19-21 at 60,000-seat U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. It was going to be the first time the event was held in a football stadium, and the total attendance record of 113,743 was expected to be shattered.
   
 The women's ice hockey tournament was scheduled to end March 20 and 22 in Boston, and the men's Frozen Four was set for April 9 and 11 in Detroit.
   
 Besides the College World Series, the top spring sport championships canceled were the men's and women's track and field June 10-13 in Austin, Texas; softball's Women's College World Series May 28-June 3 in Oklahoma City; men's lacrosse final four May 28 and 30 in East Hartford, Connecticut; and the women's lacrosse championship May 22 and 24 in Baltimore.
   
 The NCAA's decision applies only to championship events. Individual conferences and schools can decide for themselves whether they want to continue their regular seasons.
   
 The Big Ten, following the Ivy League's move on Wednesday, announced there would be no more spring sport competitions this year. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Pac-12 suspended competition indefinitely, and the Big 12 and Southeastern Conference suspended play until the end of the month.
   
 The Pac-12's Stanford announced separately that its winter and spring sports teams are done for the season.
   
 ESPN college baseball analyst Kyle Peterson, who grew up in Omaha and pitched for Stanford in the CWS in 1995 and '97, said the NCAA's decision to cancel the College World Series was rash.
   
 "I don't understand why we're canceling something that at this point is 3 1/2 months out," Peterson said. "That, to me, I disagree with. I don't disagree with the concern associated with this because I think it's entirely warranted. Anything for the next 30-60 days, whatever the time frame is that we can understand what we're dealing with, that's what we all need to do as a country. Middle of June seemed unnecessary at this point."
   
 Jack Diesing Jr., chairman of the local organizing committee for the College World Series, said it was a prudent decision by the NCAA considering there is regional and super regional competition in the two weeks leading to the CWS.
   
 "In order to qualify, you have to travel around and play games and people are going to be there," Diesing said. "Out of an abundance of caution, let's not take any chances of unduly exposing the student-athlete or the fans to potential sickness."

SAFFORD – For the first time ever, the dreamers behind the the Gila River Linear Park unveiled their concept for the trail last week at a meeting held by the Gila Watershed Partnership.
 "Collectively, we can do a lot of cool things," said Eric Swanson of Langley Properties. "I think there are some really cool things going on here. This will be a place where families want to go, where they can feel safe. It's going to be a great fit for everybody."
 Held at the Circle D Ranch House on Discovery Park Campus, the meeting welcomed the public and stakeholders to come observe the scope of the plan and offer comments and suggestions on the development of the park going forward. The GWP welcomed speakers from developers and architects to give a presentation on the design plan for the park.
 “I'm really proud to be a part of this project,” said architect Don McGann of McGann & Associates out of Tucson. “This is a park for the community and we want you to be part of the design.”
 The trial will be built in segments over several years. The initial trial will be as long as five miles in length and will comprise a number of features including both paved and unpaved paths, restrooms, and pedestrians bridges. Eventually, the trail could include scenic benches, bird-watching stations and interpretive exhibits.
 Those behind the project believe the park will become a tourist destination. It will provide people a chance to get out and exercise and enjoy the river, while increasing property values and restoring habitat.
 The corridor proposed for the park is along privately owned land and the funding for the initial phase of the project came courtesy of funding provided by Freeport McMoran and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
 They hope to finish creating a master plan for the project by the end of May, at which time it will be presented to the public for additional input and eventually, to local city councils and Graham County Board of Supervisors. After that, they'll begin hunting for funding.
 The idea for the park had been floating around for some time and the GWP eventually crossed paths with Graham County Supervisor Danny Smith, who had similar ideas in driving tourism to the region. In August last year Smith shared his plans at the quarterly public meeting of the Greenlee County Tourism Council. Speaking alongside Clifton Mayor Luis Montoya, Smith discussed forming a “string of pearls” along waterways in Graham and Greenlee counties. The Gila River Linear Park looks to be the first link in that chain.
 The GWP and associates acknowledge there are a number of challenges to be overcome in bringing the project to fruition.
 “It's a relatively high cost investment, so there needs to be a protection from flooding,” Swanson said.
 In addition, there's the problem of wildcat dumping. The ADEQ described wildcat dumping as the disposal of waste in any location that has not been approved by the department.
 The trail, which is proposed to stretch between Little Hollywood and Reay Lane along the south side of the river, is an area notorious for wildcat dumping and has been the site of several cleanups sponsored by groups like Southeastern Arizona Clean and Beautiful. The creation of the park may change all of that however.
 “The legitimate use of corridors have resulted in the reduction of wildcat dumping,” Swanson said.
 “We're seeing that actually work at some of the areas we've been doing cleanups for a long time,” GWP Director Melanie Tluczek said. “For example we had a cleanup along the San Francisco river this past weekend, and we had 45 people out there. That's a record number and one of those sites was absolutely trashed the first time I visited it two years ago and I, for the life of me, could not find a piece of garbage there this time.” Tluczek said SEACAB is aware of the Gila River Linear Park project and the group has expressed its excitement to clean the area in preparation for the opening phase of the park.
 Approximately 40 people turned out to offer their thoughts on the project. One man who identified himself as having been a local farmer expressed concerns of confrontation between the agricultural community and those making use of the park. He stated there would need to be multiple access points through the land across the trail and he was also concerned about the damage a sudden river corridor fire could do to park trails.
 Another woman familiar with local water concerns said, “It's imperative that this project does not divert any water from the river.” She noted there are ongoing legal battles between the Graham County Irrigation District and the San Carlos Apache Tribe and Gila River Indian community. That led to the question of whether the plants planned for the park would be able to be planted along the corridor without violating any agreements, but Tluczek said there would be no issue.
 “The plan we have currently is really focused on the trail alignments and making sure that what we're doing benefits everybody. You know, including the farmers and other land users, and link in with the plans that the city has as well,” she said.
 “The restoration, I'd have to say, those plans are going to be developed after this plan is finalized, and really there's a lot of opportunity there. We've got thousands of plants that are native to this state. We have hundreds if not thousands of plants that are native to this area and there's a lot of options for us here,” she said.
 The GWP said that while there isn't another community meeting in the same vein as this one planned for the future, the public will be welcome to attend presentations in future meetings with the Safford city council, Thatcher town council, and Graham County Board of Supervisors.

Gedu said the main disagreement “stems from Egypt’s refusal to accept the rights other countries have on the river. There are attempts to enforce colonial agreements but that will never be accepted by Ethiopia. I know the Nile River is God’s gift for Egypt. The same is true for Ethiopia and Sudan. Egyptians should come to terms with that.”

Paris, March 14 (AFP) FIFA on Friday recommended that all international football matches scheduled for March and April be postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus.
 Falling short of banning matches outright, world football's governing body said that clubs would be allowed to refuse to send their players to national squad gatherings in March and April.
 FIFA also said that it was working on rescheduling qualifying matches for the 2022 World Cup in both Asia and South America which have been postponed.
 "All international matches previously scheduled to take place in March and April should now be postponed until such time that they can take place in a safe and secure environment," FIFA said.
 FIFA added that the "final decision" on any postponements "rests with the respective competition organisers or relevant member association in case of friendlies".
 FIFA rules normally oblige clubs to release players for national team matches, but this rule has been temporarily reversed.
 "In light of the current situation concerning the Coronavirus, FIFA has decided that general football rules which normally oblige clubs to release players for national team matches will not apply for the up-coming international windows in March/April," the statement said. AFP KHS

With broadcast news all too often dominated by overhyped and insipid superficiality -- or downright crud -- newspapers have never been more important or necessary than they are today. Electronic delivery has its place. But the industry pooh-bahs' growing insistence that everything be digital-only is both shortsighted and foolish. And those who publicly shame their subscribers by labeling those who want or expect a print edition as hopelessly old-fashioned or out-of-date all but ensure their paper's imminent demise. For when dissed subscribers jump ship and readership plummets, advertising dollars dry up, and that sure-fire Pulitzer Prize-winning series might as well be written in invisible ink.

Only six months after cutting the number of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette print editions to just three per week -- the other four are only available electronically -- the paper's parent company has done the same thing at another metropolitan daily located just down the road a piece -- signaling in its announcement that print editions in both cities will likely be a thing of the past before the end of the year. Not that the chairman of the board gives a rip how many subscribers this leaves inconvenienced or for whom the paper will no longer be accessible. In true "let them eat cake" fashion -- and he actually said this -- such folks should ante up for an iPad, or if they really like paper so much, buy a printer and produce their own printed version.
