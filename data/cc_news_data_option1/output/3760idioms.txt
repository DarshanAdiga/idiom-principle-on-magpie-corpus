I have run into a problem that appears to not be a problem for anyone else. I believe I have narrowed the problem down to this issue. I have a php class that inserts an array of items into a table. I also need it to insert the primary key (id) from a users table into a foreign key (user_id) in an aboutuser table. I am able to successfully do EITHER an insertion of the data, OR an insertion of the primary key. I can not seem to do them both. I have experimented with ‘transactions’ (shown below) and a slew of other things, but I am still unable to complete both tasks. According to mysql manual, I must use LAST_INSERT_ID() simultaneously with the insertion of the input data, otherwise the resulting user_id will be zero(which I unfortunately had a longterm problem with). Can anyone help with this issue? I will paste the PHP class script below. If more code is needed for you to investigate please let me know what you need.

Oh, how Poirot likes to toy with Catchpool! This infuriating talk of _Peepers_ unfolds while Catchpool is trying to get to the bottom of a disturbing drama happening among the other passengers. A young woman with "an unfinished face" — her skin is dull and bloodless and her eyes and lips are recessive, retreating — appears to have just suffered a terrible and inexplicable shock. She starts walking around in little circles, talking to herself. Another passenger — seemingly a stranger — loudly berates her for her odd behavior. Catchpool's instincts go on high alert — there's more here than meets the eye, but Poirot ignores him and shoos him to his seat.
 If only Poirot had listened, instead of treating Catchpool like a bagged lunch. Would at least one part of the tragedy at Kingfisher Hill have been averted? What Catchpool sees; what he can't pull his attention from is at the heart of the real reason for their journey to Kingfisher Hill.

Coastal communities began preparing for Beta over the weekend, with the Texas city of Galveston and surrounding Galveston County issuing voluntary evacuation orders on Saturday. Seabrook, north of Galveston, issued its own order.Craig Brown, the mayor pro tem of Galveston, said in a statement that high tides and up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of expected rainfall would leave roads impassable, especially in the west end and low-lying areas of the city.Judge Mark Henry, the top elected official for Galveston County, said Saturday that a mandatory evacuation order isn’t expected, but that he was concerned about the damage that storm surge could cause and suggested that people find a safer place to wait out the storm, if possible.“If you can survive in your home for three or four days without power and electricity, which we’re not even sure that’s going to happen, you’re OK,” Henry said. “If it’s uncomfortable or you need life support equipment, maybe go somewhere else.”Beta was churning slowly through the Gulf late Sunday morning about 180 miles (290 kilometers) southeast of Galveston, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph) and was moving west-northwestward at 3 mph (6 kph).Little change in strength was expected as the system approached Texas, forecasters said. Earlier predictions showed Beta could reach hurricane strength before making landfall. A tropical storm warning was in effect for a stretch of coastline stretching from Port Aransas, about 165 miles (265 kilometers southwest of Galveston, to Morgan City, Louisiana, 80 miles (128 kilometers) west of New Orleans. A hurricane watch, a tropical storm watch and a storm surge watch were all discontinued Sunday morning.In Lake Charles, Louisiana, where thousands of people remained without power more than three weeks after Hurricane Laura slammed into the coast, there were concerns that Beta could super-soak the region again. Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain could fall in some parts of the area, Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in Lake Charles, said during a Saturday briefing.“A lot of people have been saying, ‘Is this going to be like Harvey? Is this going to be like Imelda?’” Jones said. “We’re not talking about rainfall totals yet that are on the orders of magnitude that we saw with that.” Imelda, which struck southeastern Texas in 2019, was one of the wettest cyclones on record. Harvey dumped more than 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rain on Houston in 2017 and caused major flooding and damage. However, if the storm ends up moving a bit slower than what’s being forecast now, rainfall totals could exceed 20 inches, Jones said.“Harvey was a very specific and unique event, but we are talking about the same idea in terms of very heavy, heavy rainfall,” he said.Forecasters were predicting up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of storm surge from Port Aransas to the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge near Lake Charles. Strong winds, and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions were also expected.Forecasters ran out of traditional storm names on Friday, forcing the use of the Greek alphabet for only the second time since the 1950s.Meanwhile, Hurricane Teddy remained a powerful hurricane Sunday, with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph) and moving northwestward at 9 mph (14 kph). Teddy was centered 300 miles (515 kilometers) south-southeast of Bermuda less than a week after Hurricane Paulette made landfall in the wealthy British territory. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Bermuda. Tropical Storm Wilfred was still at sea but was expected to dissipate by Tuesday.Parts of the Alabama coast and Florida Panhandle were still reeling from the effects of Hurricane Sally, which roared ashore on Wednesday. At least two deaths were blamed on the system. Roughly 82,300 were still without power in the Florida Panhandle on Saturday. Gulf Power said 95% of its customers in hardest hit Escambia and Santa Rosa counties will have power restored by the end of the day Tuesday.The Salvation Army was distributing roughly 10,000 meals Saturday at 10 locations throughout the Panhandle. ___Associated Press reporters Kelli Kennedy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Ken Miller in Oklahoma City and Jeff Martin in Marietta, Georgia, contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Removing sight has a greater impact on a person than you'd expect so you need to try out a quality blindfold like Dominix Deluxe Padded Leather Blindfold. Anticipation becomes heightened and ever sensation is intensified when we can't see what's happening. A blindfolded person who is also restrained can really sink into space where their entire being is in the hands of their Dom.


  While you can use almost anything as a blindfold, you should have at least one dedicated quality blindfold in your collection. This blindfold by Dominx is made of real leather with a sexy buckle closure.


  It has thick padding so that when it's applied, it molds around your eyes and nose, blocking out all light for a true in-the-dark experience without being uncomfortable. You want blindfolds to be something a sub can comfortably wear for long periods so the focus can be elsewhere and this one fits that bill for me.

Marissa discussed getting their produce ready to go to market.


  “We enjoy farming, but bringing in the harvest is hard work,” she said. “During the summer, we might begin at 5 p.m. and work until 1 a.m. picking vegetables, Last year we had our flashlights in the garden. Sometimes we cleaned the radishes in the middle of the night.”


  The Brecheisens said they believe that all animals, even their hogs, should be nurtured.


  “We raise the hogs with tender loving care,” Marissa said.


  “They have a big area to roam around to get to the roots and the minerals from them,” Jeremy said. “In the summer there is a tree line where they go to get cool. They are proudly grown and humanely raised here.”


  In addition to the hogs, the couple has 20 goats, 100-plus chickens, 100-plus ducks and “furbabies” — several cats and, at present, five dogs. Lucky, a large, white canine, acts as the Brecheisen Farm guardian.


  Kelly Howell of Penny Farm near Commerce sells homemade baked goods, including cakes and her sprouted grain bread at a booth across from the Brecheisens at the Greenville Farmers Market.


  “Marissa and Jeremy work very hard,” Howell said. “They grow their microgreens, which are organic and wonderful. They have those up through the late fall and into the winter. Then in the early spring, they get their other gardens going. They have a couple of greenhouses so that they can get started early when the weather’s ugly. They follow organic practices. They also have grass-fed pork. My husband and I have enjoyed pork chops, ham steaks, chorizo and breakfast sausage. They are wonderful people, always sweet and always smiling.”


  Monica Lubiani is a Greenville fused glass artist who sells her jewelry and glass pieces at the Farmers Market.


  “Jeremy and Marissa make you feel like family,” Lubiani said. “They always have delicious food and recipes to share. They are a wonderful asset to the community and the Farmers Market. We’re so lucky that they make the farm-to- table experience so enjoyable.


  “When I started selling my glass at the Farmers Market, Marissa was the first to welcome me with open arms. She brings such joy and life to the market. She and Jeremy are certainly a large reason why the Farmers Market is so successful.”


  Jeremy explains how they meld their farm work into a lifestyle.


  “Marissa is the real farmer,” he said. “I do the heavy lifting and operate the tractor. We don’t watch TV much. We get plenty of exercise, and we’re out in sun to get our vitamin D. We eat our own produce and pork, but we still shop at the grocery store. Intangibles include meeting great people and producing something of value locally that doesn’t use chemicals. Our small business works with other businesses such as the East Texas Print Shop, Steve’s Nursery and the Bluebonnet Meat Company in Trenton.


  “When we started here five years ago, we knew no one at the market. Now it’s different. If you want to get to know good people, come to the Greenville Farmers Market. We’ve been here long enough that now we are familiar with the families, and we learn about the births of their children or grandchildren as well as about the deaths. We’ve seen ups and downs, just the kind of stuff that in a community is the natural stuff. Since 2015, we’ve met many fantastic people just through this process.”


  “We love this community so much,” Marissa said. “Everyone is so supportive. There is no place that I would rather be.”

About 15% posts of teachers of all cadres, including junior basic training (JBT) teachers, trained graduate teachers (TGTs) and others, are lying vacant in Chandigarh schools, revealed the data provided by Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank in the Lok Sabha on a question regarding such vacancies in various states and UTs.


  There are 5,797 sanctioned posts of teachers in Chandigarh of which 872 are vacant. The national average is 17.1%. Among the UTs, Chandigarh has the fifth highest percentage of vacancies.


  While addressing the issue, education minister Pokhriyal said, "The recruitment of teachers is a continuous process and vacancies arise after they retire."


  President of joint action committee of government schoolteachers of Chandigarh, Bhag Singh Kairon, said, "The number of vacancies has increased over the years as the age of retirement has been fixed at 58 for teachers and no extension is given. After 1992, not even a single regularised post graduate teacher has been appointed, so if the number of vacancies rises further, students will have to suffer."


  UT Cadre of Education Employees' Union head Swarn Singh Kamboj said, "Although teachers were recruited in 2009 and 2015, the rate is not high enough as compared to the teachers retiring. Many more teachers are set to retire at the end of this month. The education department has to make a new recruitment for each teacher that retires. Teachers get burdened with extra duties if there aren't enough of them."


  Assuring a prompt action, director school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, said, "We have recently appointed around 800 teachers under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The appointment of post graduate teachers is also in the pipeline and we would soon be recruiting such teachers after a period of around 30 years."

Deutsche’s problems were so striking they prompted Bank of America to file a confidential alert known as a suspicious activity report, or SAR, to the US government. Bank of America employees had visited Deutsche’s London office to discuss worries about Russian money laundering. They were stonewalled when a Deutsche manager interrupted their meeting and asked them to leave the building. Bank of America found the situation troubling enough that it raised the matter with Achleitner, according to its filing.
 Another top Deutsche executive, Christian Sewing, ran the audit division when one of its teams gave the Moscow office a clean bill of health, despite evidence that it could not even produce a list of its clients, let alone verify that they were who they said they were. Sewing is now Deutsche’s CEO.
 In all, more than 100 internal alerts were raised on the companies at the heart of the Russian mirror trade scandal between 2012 and 2015.
 During these years, some of the world’s worst criminals used the network to move dark money around the globe, with the help of shell companies and corrupt financiers. Business owners like Meltzer, Gilula, and Sullivan were left to pick up the pieces. The wide range of criminal activity linked to the mirror trades has never before been revealed.
 The FinCEN Files investigation includes thousands of closely held US Treasury documents — among them, suspicious activity reports — that BuzzFeed News shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and more than 100 newsrooms around the world. This investigation is also based on confidential bank documents obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, a partner in this project.
 By law, banks must file SARs to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, when they spot activity that bears the hallmarks of money laundering or other financial misconduct. SARs by themselves are not evidence of a crime, but they can support investigations and intelligence gathering.

Liverpool showed Chelsea still have far to go to challenge the champions for the Premier League title as Sadio Mane took advantage of a first-half red card shown to Andreas Christensen to score both goals in a 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge.


  Mane provoked the Dane's dismissal and then headed the Reds into the lead before pouncing on another terrible error from the Blues' goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.


  At the other end, Alisson Becker also proved the value of a good goalkeeper as he saved Jorginho's penalty 15 minutes from time to deny the Blues a lifeline.


  Victory takes Liverpool level on points with Everton, Arsenal and Crystal Palace at the top of the table as the only sides with maximum points from their opening two games.


  Chelsea have spent £200 million ($260 million) in the transfer market to try and close the 33-point gap between the sides last season, but the decision to invest most of that in forwards rather than addressing more urgent defensive needs was badly exposed.


  A lack of defensive reinforcements with Thiago Silva still not match fit was obvious in Frank Lampard's gameplan as the Chelsea boss tried to protect a backline that conceded 54 league goals last season in a cagey first-half.


  Christensen bailed out Kepa from another embarrassing error as he was caught in no man's land early on but the defender got back to prevent Roberto Firmino converting Mohamed Salah's cross.


  Despite Liverpool dominating possession, Chelsea had the best sight of goal in the first half when Timo Werner dragged wide from the edge of the box.


  But the hosts' good defensive work was undone seconds before the break as Mane raced onto Jordan Henderson's ball over the ball and was hauled down by Christensen.


  Referee Paul Tierney initially only showed a yellow card, but overturned his decision after viewing the incident on a pitchside monitor and Christensen was dismissed.


  Jurgen Klopp irked Lampard when he said the Reds could not behave like clubs owned by oil-rich states or oligarchs such as Manchester City and Chelsea in the transfer market.


  But Liverpool have been busy this week with Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota becoming their first major signings for two years.


  Klopp instantly called for Thiago to make his debut at half-time in place of the injured Henderson and it took just five minutes in the second-half to make the breakthrough.


  Mane again did the damage as he met Firmino's cross with a firm header into the far corner.


  Chelsea's spending spree is not yet over with Edouard Mendy set to join from Rennes as Lampard's patience with Kepa, who cost a world record £72 million for a goalkeeper two years ago, exhausted.


  Liverpool's second will only have confirmed the former England midfielder's decision as Kepa's casual pass was intercepted by Mane, who then turned the ball into an empty net.


  Alisson's record as the world's most expensive goalkeeper lasted just three weeks in 2018 between his move from Roma and Chelsea paying Kepa's buyout clause from Athletic Bilbao.


  But the Brazilian has more than justified his £67 million price tag in wining the Champions League and Premier League over the past two seasons and produced a big save when Liverpool needed it.


  Thiago did not have a dream debut as he was the culprit for clipping Werner's legs as he burst into the area.


  Jorginho's stutter-step run up has fooled many a goalkeeper in the past, but Alisson held his ground before diving low to his left to save.

"articleBody" : "The sea-saw moments during the last week resulted in a flat closing. With two sharp sell-off spells from the highs, the benchmark indices failed to move higher. The Nifty finally closed with 40.50 points or 0.35 per cent during the last week. The BSE Sensex lost 0.2per cent. The outperformance of broader indices continued. The Nifty Midcap-100 and Smallcap-100 indices advanced by 3.8 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. On the sectoral front, pharma and IT indices gained by most with 8.9 per cent and 6.4 per cent respectively. The Financial services index and PSU Bank indices fell by 4.5 per cent and 3.9 per cent respectively. Overall market breadth is slightly negative. Barring one day, the FIIs continue to buy, and the DIIs sold the equities last week.The Nifty took support 20DMA for at least three times during the last week. It filled the gap of September 4. On the weekly chart, it formed a small body candle. The net distribution days at the end of the week are six, as one added and one is expired. The uptrend since March low is now under pressure as the momentum is waning. Even though the Nifty has not made any lower since then, the high is not so convincing. Last Wednesday's high is important for the ongoing trend. Around 11,620 levels, the Nifty faced the resistance several times in the recent past. The 20DMA is almost flattened, is an indication of consolidation mode and the sideways action to continue. The Nifty is also forming a pattern similar to head to shoulder after bottom formation on August 3. In any case, if Nifty fails to move above 11620-11690 range, we expect a dip toward 50DMA at 11,281. There are several supports at around this level. There trend line support around 11,380 and gap support on September 10 also placed. As the distribution day's count is on the higher side, fall below 50DMA can be categorised as a downtrend. The Kaufman's Adaptive MA's support is placed at 11387. This KAMA is flattened from a rising staircase, and any turn will signal the reversal from the current level. The 30EMA support is at 11377. These many supports must hold for a continuation of the uptrend. In any case, bulls able to take the Nifty above 11618 and 11690 resistance zone, then the uptrend will resume. The Daryl Guppy's MMA setup indicates, the current is in danger at the set of short term averages are flatten and some of them are turned down too. For the first time RoC has reached below the zero line, and Martin Pring's KST shows the index. The RSI is failed to sustain at 60 levels and forming another downward channel. The divergences are still there in most of the indicators. In a nutshell, the 11,620-11690 on the top and 11440 - 11370 zone will act as a support and resistance for the next week. In case of breaching 11281- 11185 zone is a sign of trend reversal and will enter into a downtrend. As the market trend is under pressure, it is better to be with a cautious approach for now. Focus on the stock with strong fundamentals and the good technical structure to build the portfolios.(The author is a financial journalist and technical analyst.

Hong Kong, September 20 (ANI): The family members of 12 Hong Kong human rights activists captured at sea last month by the Chinese authorities reported the case to Hong Kong police on Sunday, urging the force to speak to their mainland counterparts for the release of marine data from that day, reported the South China Morning Post.   The families said that the officials need to get in touch directly with the 12 "as many questions remain unanswered" including the reason the mainland (Chinese authorities) refused to allow family-appointed lawyers to meet with the captured at the detention centre in Shenzhen's Yantian district.   The 12 -- who were attempting to flee to Taiwan -- were linked to the protest cases last year. One of the protests, Andy Li was arrested by the police under the draconian law passed by the Chinese Communist Party.   "Up till now, the lawyers appointed by the families have not been allowed to meet with the detainees. In other words, the conditions of the arrested persons are still known only to the Chinese authorities," said a statement from the families read by activist Owen Chow Ka-shing, who has been assisting them.   "The Hong Kong government has only used official information from China, becoming a willing mouthpiece of the Chinese government, and has never provided any details or sent anyone there to clarify the doubts."  


  According to the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong security minister John Lee Ka-chiu told a local broadcaster that the 12 Hong Kongers had appointed lawyers from a list "approved by the mainland authorities". He also said that the detained Hong Kongers were in good health "even though no local officials visited them".   South China Morning Post also reported that the families had urged the Hong Kong government to meet with the detainees or at least speak to them telephonically.   The Chinese foreign ministry in a statement had confirmed that the group comprised 11 men and a woman, aged 16 to 33 have been detained while they were trying to escape China.   Since the enactment of draconian law, several pro-democracy activists have been fleeing for a safe haven to other countries.   Beijing had imposed the National Security Law in Hong Kong in June targeting acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with punishments of up to life in prison for the most serious offences.   The move came after months of social upheaval triggered by opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill but that morphed into wider demands, including universal suffrage.   The legislation, which came into effect on July 1, punishes what Beijing terms secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference with punishment ranging up to a life-term in prison. (ANI)

They (Buhari and Obasanjo) both claim to be (and indeed they are) patriots, but their patriotism derives from different sources. While Obasanjo, most times, seeks justification from and mostly kow-tows to the North to prove his patriotism, PMB looks inward, especially to his Fulani heritage, and corals other Nigerians to justify why the nation must remain one. Unfortunately for Obasanjo, some of his Yoruba people perceive him as an outcast, and some of his children don’t see eye to eye with him.

Even when she was winning state championships as a Mansfield volleyball player, Kaylie Pyles was dreaming of the future.
   
 She had the dream of returning to her alma mater as coach and guide the Lady Tigers to more titles.
   
 Pyles has achieved the dream of going back to Mansfield as the team's coach. And in her third season at her alma mater, Pyles has the Lady Tigers on target to contend for a championship.
   
 Mansfield is 9-0 on the season.
   
 After dropping down from 3A to 2A in the off-season, the Lady Tigers are also dominating in their new league, the 2A-West, with a 7-0 record after a decisive three-set win Thursday at Mulberry.
   
 "It was definitely something that I always dreamed about doing," Pyles said. "My goal was always to come back to my hometown, to give back to the program that gave me everything.
   
 "When I interviewed for the job and they let me know that I received it, it was almost like a dream came true honestly, because I love the town and I love the support and the community and the school district."
   
 As a Lady Tiger player, Pyles was a part of state title teams her junior and senior seasons, 2012 and 2013. Mansfield also won state the season after Pyles graduated, which was the last time the Lady Tigers won state.
   
 After playing volleyball at Henderson State, it didn't take very long for Pyles to return to her alma mater. She interviewed for the vacant Lady Tiger coaching position in 2018 right after she graduated from college and landed her dream job.
   
 In her first two seasons, Pyles led the Lady Tigers to winning records. They finished third in their 3A conference both seasons and qualified for the opening round at state.
   
 But in Pyles' third season, Mansfield has broken through with its perfect record.
   
 "Honestly, it comes back to the girls and the summer, having to work around all the guidelines with COVID," Pyles said. "We obviously focused a lot on individual basics; we went back to the basics working on those and I think it really has helped our squad improve a lot on some of the things we weren't as strong at last year, especially our defense.
   
 "Our passing has also greatly improved from summer and from last year."
   
 Pyles added the players' work habits have been another factor in the Lady Tigers' hot start.
   
 "The girls, they are extremely committed, they're hard-working, they always want to be in the gym as much as they can," Pyles said. "Some of them go and take extra lessons on their own, they're working at home and it's amazing how much we've improved because the girls are putting in so much work.
   
 "Honestly, it's work ethic and determination."
   
 Perhaps the Lady Tigers' biggest win came last Monday when they went to 5A school Alma and pulled out a five-set triumph after trailing the Lady Airedales, 2-1.
   
 "We went up there and I told the girls that you have a chance to beat a bigger classification that is known to be good at volleyball," Pyles said. "I said this is something that I wanted to see where we were at and I told them to put it all out there, do your best and we can come out on top.
   
 "It was back-and-forth the entire game and it was a very exciting game and my girls, they were fighters."
   
 The Lady Tigers are also built for more success beyond this season. They have only one senior who plays on the varsity squad, 5-foot-10 middle blocker Brooke Wright, who was an All-State player last season.
   
 Wright currently leads the team in kills (109) and in blocks (15).
   
 "I have been trying my best to be a leader for the girls," Wright said. "Previously, when I was an underclassman, I looked up to the seniors.
   
 "As a third-year starter, I knew that it was going to be my job this year to guide my team."
   
 Wright also gave credit to Pyles for her role in the team's success, not just on the court but off of it as well.
   
 "Coach Pyles has taught us to be better people. ... She has encouraged unity among our team," Wright said. "With all team sports, good team chemistry is absolutely vital for success."
   
 Pyles generally uses eight players during the course of a match. She made one key change prior to the season, moving junior Kiara Thomas to libero.
   
 Thomas leads the team in digs with 132. Junior Haylee Helms also regularly plays on the back row.
   
 Up front, Wright and junior Sadie Roberts are the middles. On the outside are sophomores Skylynn Harris and Brooklyn Adams.
   
 Then there's setters in sophomores Natalie Allison and Madelen Jones, who is the team's assist leader with 169.
   
 "I think we have a really good chance the next few years to be very successful and have a run at several state championships. ... I have a great freshman group that's moving up also that are also undefeated," Pyles said.
   
 The future can wait for Pyles, though. She's focused on the present, as the team has adopted the motto, "Make History."
   
 Mansfield was to have had a home match Monday against last season's 2A state champion, Hackett, but that has been canceled. The Lady Tigers will jump back into league action Tuesday with a match against Eureka Springs.

Sadio Mane tormented Chelsea as the Liverpool forward struck twice after sparking Andreas Christensen's dismissal in the champions' 2-0 win, while Son Heung-min scored four as Tottenham crushed Southampton 5-2 on Sunday.


  Mane was involved in the turning point at Stamford Bridge as the first clash between Premier League title contenders this season swung Liverpool's way.


  In first half stoppage-time, Jordan Henderson picked out Mane's run behind Christensen and the Denmark defender responded by rugby-tackling the Senegal star to the ground.


  Referee Paul Tierney initially booked Christensen, but VAR told him to consult the pitchside monitor and he changed his decision to a red card.


  Mane grabbed his first goal of the season in the 50th minute as he met Roberto Firmino's cross with a thumping header after eluding Reece James' slack marking.


  Mane was gifted his second goal as Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga made a hash of trying to play out from the back, allowing the Liverpool forward to intercept and slot into the empty net.


  It was the latest costly blunder from Kepa, who was dropped twice by Chelsea manager Frank Lampard last season despite his status as the world's most expensive keeper.


  Lampard will be relieved that Chelsea are reportedly close to signing Rennes' Senegal international Edouard Mendy as he looks to replace Kepa.


  Thiago Alcantara made his Liverpool debut at half-time after his move from Bayern Munich, but the Spain midfielder conceded a 74th minute penalty with a foul on Timo Werner.


  Alisson Becker came to Thiago's rescue as he saved Jorginho's spot-kick.


  After their chaotic 4-3 win over Leeds on the opening weekend, this was a return to the kind of dominant display Liverpool produced so often en route to their first English title for 30 years last season.


  While Chelsea have spent £200 million ($258 million) on new signings in a bid to close the gap on the champions, Liverpool remain streets ahead of the Blues at present.


  \- Son shines -


  At St Mary's, Jose Mourinho hailed Son and Harry Kane after the pair destroyed Southampton.


  Just 24 hours after Tottenham signed Gareth Bale, Son delivered a virtuoso display that showed Mourinho's side already have plenty of firepower.


  Bale has returned to Tottenham on a season-long loan from Real Madrid seven years after he left the north London club for a then world record £85 million fee.


  But the Wales forward will not be available until mid-October as he recovers from a knee injury, so Mourinho needs Son and Kane to carry the attack until then.


  Danny Ings put Southampton ahead in the first half, but Son equalised before the break and scored three more in the second half, with each of his goals coming from Kane assists.


  Kane, who hit the back of the net twice in the first half only to have them ruled out for offside, capped a swaggering display with his second goal of the season.


  "Son was on fire and for me Harry Kane was the man of the match, what he did for the team," Mourinho said.


  "With him dropping back and connecting the game between the lines for Sonny to attack, the space they created was a problem they couldn't resolve."


  After losing to Everton in their Premier League opener last weekend, Tottenham have lifted the gloom with this vibrant second half performance after the Bale coup.


  Neal Maupay's quick-fire double inspired Brighton's 3-0 win against Newcastle as the Seagulls claimed their first Premier League victory of the season.


  Graham Potter's side raced into a two-goal lead after just seven minutes at St James' Park thanks to the brace from French striker Maupay.


  Aaron Connolly grabbed the third for Brighton, who had Yves Bissouma sent off after his raised boot caught Jamal Lewis in the face.

CHANDIGARH About 15% posts of teachers of all cadres, including junior basic training (JBT) teachers, trained graduate teachers (TGTs) and others, are lying vacant in Chandigarh schools, revealed the data provided by Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank in the Lok Sabha on a question regarding such vacancies in various states and UTs. There are 5,797 sanctioned posts of teachers in Chandigarh of which 872 are vacant. The national average is 17.1%. Among the UTs, Chandigarh has the fifth highest percentage of vacancies. While addressing the issue, education minister Pokhriyal said, "The recruitment of teachers is a continuous process and vacancies arise after they retire." President of joint action committee of government schoolteachers of Chandigarh, Bhag Singh Kairon, said, "The number of vacancies has increased over the years as the age of retirement has been fixed at 58 for teachers and no extension is given. After 1992, not even a single regularised post graduate teacher has been appointed, so if the number of vacancies rises further, students will have to suffer."UT Cadre of Education Employees' Union head Swarn Singh Kamboj said, "Although teachers were recruited in 2009 and 2015, the rate is not high enough as compared to the teachers retiring. Many more teachers are set to retire at the end of this month. The education department has to make a new recruitment for each teacher that retires. Teachers get burdened with extra duties if there aren't enough of them."Assuring a prompt action, director school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, said, "We have recently appointed around 800 teachers under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The appointment of post graduate teachers is also in the pipeline and we would soon be recruiting such teachers after a period of around 30 years."

The scheme was uncovered four years later in 2016, and the following year authorities in the US and UK fined Deutsche Bank $630 million for its role. Mirror trades are permitted under the law, but they can be manipulated for illegal purposes such as money laundering.
 A spokesperson for Deutsche noted that the mirror trading network “was criminal action by individuals,” and said that authorities in the US and Europe had praised the bank for being “exceptionally cooperative” with their investigations. Since the scandal hit, the bank has “committed significant resources” to stopping money laundering, the spokesperson said.
 Danske Bank declined to comment on Financial Bridge, but acknowledged its own 200 billion euro money laundering scandal. “We were too slow in realising the extent of the issues and to close it down,” said Philippe Vollot, its chief compliance officer, in a statement.
 Marakin’s alleged role in the vast mirror trading network is laid out in a secret intelligence report, written by analysts at the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and shared by BuzzFeed News with ICIJ.
 The report, marked “Law Enforcement Sensitive,” warned that the network “highlights a vulnerability in the global securities market for money laundering.” Using a mix of bank data and other intelligence, it detailed how the network allegedly conducted billions of dollars’ worth of trades, some on behalf of “illicit actors.”
 At the heart of the system, according to the report, were four Russians who used a series of banks and brokerages to transfer “billions of dollars per year” for a “fee of up to five percent.” According to the report, they used Russian rubles to buy stock in large companies, then immediately transferred the shares to Europe and sold them on for dollars, euros, or pounds — allowing them to change large currency sums without the usual oversight from the authorities.
 Two of the four Russians, Alexei Kulikov and Oleg Belousov, owned stakes in Promsberbank, where President Putin’s cousin Igor was a director. Millions of dollars were stolen from the bank. Bankruptcy documents from Promsberbank show that money had been siphoned into the mirror trading network.
 Kulikov was jailed for his role in the Promsberbank theft. Belousov’s whereabouts are unknown. Neither responded to requests for comment.
 Another alleged key figure in the scheme, the Russian financier Andrei Babenko, is now in Israel where he has worked in the cryptocurrency industry. The fourth, Andrey Gorbatov, is in Moscow, according to his LinkedIn profile. Both Babenko and Gorbatov denied involvement in the network in interviews with BuzzFeed News.
 Marakin was a director or owner of at least three companies in the mirror trading network, including one that sent cash to a firm controlled by Lazar Shaybazian, who was barred from the US financial system in 2012 for his work with Vladislav “Blonde” Leontyev, described by US authorities as a Russian mobster and a high-level narcotics trafficker.
 The government has declared that Shaybazian and Leontyev are part of a group called the “Brothers' Circle,” a network of Eurasian criminals linked to drugs, human trafficking, and violence around the world.
 Shaybazian did not respond to requests for comment. Leontyev said he had been wrongly targeted by US sanctions and did not know Shaybazian.
 All these transactions occurred behind closed doors while another saga played out in public: Was Perepilichnyy assassinated and, if so, was that murder linked to his disclosures of Russian money laundering?

Interim coach Dean Young doesn't know why St George Illawarra didn't turn to up to play Newcastle on Sunday, but says after two lean years the players have lost belief.


  In their penultimate NRL game of the season, the Dragons gave a miserable account of themselves for a 42-18 loss to the Knights - their fourth in a row.


  After finishing 15th last season and winning just six games this campaign, hope is scarce at the Dragons in a particularly taxing year.


  "It was a disappointing performance that's for sure. I didn't see that coming," Young said.


  "I honestly thought we could win today but the players are probably lacking a bit of belief and probably don't believe they can win at the moment."


  But whether not they were sidetracked by the light at the end of the tunnel, Young lamented the performance and effort to let in seven tries.


  Four tries poured through the middle of the field through soft defence, including the first one four minutes in.


  Hooker Chris Randall darted through confused defenders 35 metres out, feeding the ball to Kalyn Ponga to score under the posts.


  It started an ominous period by the Knights in which they scored four tries in 21 minutes.


  "When you let in soft tries it's sort of a reflection of what the game means to you," Young said.


  "Have you had enough or are we still willing to fight for the death? I'm not too sure.


  "We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves because I know Melbourne Storm won't be feeling sorry for us next week.


  "We need to dust ourselves off and get ready for a game back at home."


  Meanwhile, Ben Hunt was taken off the field late in the second half with what is believed to be a quad injury, but the club could not confirm whether it was serious following the match.


  Any significant injury would put him in doubt for Queensland selection when State of Origin squads are announced at the end of the week.

More than seven months after the state education department conducted scholarship examination for students of Classes 5 and 8, it has not been able to declare the results yet, leaving thousands of students in a lurch.


  The scholarship exam was conducted across the state on February 16. While results of the exam are usually declared in a couple of months, this year there is no word on when it would be out.


  "It has been over seven months now and students are eagerly awaiting their results. There is no word from the department on this. If there is a delay, the least we expect is an announcement in this regard," said the parent of an aspirant from the city.

"Cut the mustard" test

That’s the old, familiar dance of culpability bargaining. Even the most vile right-wing media pundit knows that to say any victim of a police killing is deserving is abhorrent. So instead of saying it outright, it becomes a game of creating an implicit judgment from an avalanche of bad faith character assessments. Villanueva’s stunt is one of creating a hierarchy of sacrifice, and football media members who fall in line, or teammates that suddenly begin questioning their judgment because of his action, are equally complicit. For them, there’s always someone more deserving of honor, someone whose sacrifice was greater, some reason why reminding people of someone killed at the hands of an over-militarized and increasingly violent police force is a sinful practice.

From there, I joined a local group known as the Ocean Beach Mer Pod, and soon I was doing both paid and volunteer appearances. Two months after my first mermaid gig, I got certified as an Open Water Scuba Diver through PADI. I also commissioned husband and wife duo, Jim and Alicia Ward of _See Through Sea_, to design a custom silicone mermaid tail which cost $2,700. It weighs 36 pounds, and feels like you're swimming with a dumbbell attached to you. It's made of medical-grade silicone and it feels more like a prosthetic than a costume. I named her Moana.


  Silicone tails are a big investment, running between $1,000 to $6,000 depending on the maker. They are mostly handmade by small creators however there are a handful of larger companies like Mertailor which offer mass silicones.


  Fabric tails like neoprene are more comfortable, weigh less, are easier to put on, and way more cost-effective ($300-$500) but they're nowhere near as realistic looking.


  When it comes to silicone versus fabric, it really comes down to just picking your poison.

If you only buy one item for your own personal Red Room, go with the  _50 Shades of Grey_ Hard Limits under-the-bed restraints. They're easy to set up (no tools needed), small to store, affordable, and set you up for a wide variety of potential scenes with the sub handcuffed or held spread-eagle to the bed.


  Best yet, it doesn't cause any permanent changes to your home. It works by wrapping the tethers around the mattress so the bed itself the anchor. If you yank on one restraint, it's the three other cuffs that give the resistance so the Dom can enjoy watching their sub struggle without worrying the movement may damage the headboard or rip an eyehook out of the wall.


  There's a reason there're jokes about the kink community and hardware stores -a lot of the bondage contraptions involve serious construction for safety and stability. And if it's not done right, it can go pretty awry. I was at a convention once where we had to evacuate the hotel because someone tried to suspend their sub from a sprinkler head.


  Under-the-bed restraints bypass all of this trouble and let you get straight to the fun stuff. Once you get them set up you can leave them on all the time, which is what I've done in the past. They're easy enough to tuck away when not in use and company won't even notice.


  Because the pieces individually hook onto each other, the versatility and basically only constrained by your imagination. This set uses padded cuffs that are secured with velcro, so they're easy to take on and off which is ideal for beginners.  Later you can swap these out for locking cuffs if you want and the under-the-bed restraints will still work.

The unexpected winner of the 2020 Tour de France Tadej Pogacar sealed a dramatic victory on stage 20 to also take the lead of the race itself.


  He climbed to the top step of the podium as champion in Paris on Sunday on the eve of his 22nd birthday.


  Here AFP Sport takes a look at some of the factors that led to the 21-year- old's success:


  Lifetime passion


  "I started watching the Tour de France back in 2009 or 2010, following Alberto Contador and Andy Schleck, spending all day in front of television and then going riding myself," the Ljubljana native said on Saturday after pulling off one of the most dramatic turnarounds in the history of cycling's most famous event.


  Youngest winner in over a century


  In 1904 Frenchman Henri Cornet won the Tour de France at the age of 19, and remains the youngest ever winner of the race. Pogacar becomes the second youngest champion after his 2020 triumph at the age of 21. He was born September 21, 1998.


  Track record


  Pogacar only joined the elite level of cycling last year and was thrown in at the deep end when UAE Emirates decided he could race a Grand Tour, the Vuelta a Espana. He won three stages on the Vuelta and ended an impressive third place behind Primoz Roglic and Alejandro Valverde. As with the Tour de France in 2020, he won three stages in Spain and took the best overall young rider's jersey.


  No doping history


  While Pogacar's ascent of the Planche des Belles Filles climb on Saturday gave sceptics food for thought, his UAE Emirates team has never been connected with even a trace of a doping scandal. Before Pogacar's arrival, UAE recruited Dan Martin, the Irish all-rounder with an immaculately clean record.


  Previous time-trial win over Roglic


  Pogacar's staggering win over his compatriot Primoz Roglic on stage 20 of the Tour was not a complete surprise. Earlier in the season the Slovenian national time-trial championships were raced over a similar course, with the climb first and the rolling section afterwards however. Pogacar changed bikes while Roglic did not, with the younger man taking victory over the much shorter course by a slender nine seconds at the finish line.
