When a team of archaeologists deep in the deserts of Sudan arrived at the ancient site of Jabal Maragha last month, they thought they were lost. The site had vanished.
 But they hadn't made a mistake. In fact, gold-hunters with giant diggers had destroyed almost all sign of the two millenia-old site.
 "They had only one goal in digging here -- to find gold," said shocked archaeologist Habab Idriss Ahmed, who had painstakingly excavated the historic location in 1999.
 "They did something crazy; to save time, they used heavy machinery."
 In the baking-hot desert of Bayouda, some 270 kilometres (170 miles) north of the capital Khartoum, the team discovered two mechanical diggers and five men at work.
 They had dug a vast trench 17 metres (55 feet) deep, and 20 meters long.
 The rust-coloured sand was scarred with tyre tracks, some cut deep into the ground, from the trucks that transported the equipment.
 The site, dating from the Meroitic period between 350 BC and 350 AD, was either a small settlement or a checkpoint. Since the diggers came, hardly anything remains.
 "They had completely excavated it, because the ground is composed of layers of sandstone and pyrite," said Hatem al-Nour, Sudan's director of antiquities and museums.
 "And as this rock is metallic their detector would start ringing. So they thought there was gold."
 \- Escape justice -
 Next to the huge gash in the ground, the diggers had piled up ancient cylindrical stones on top of each other to prop up a roof for their dining room.
 The archaeologists were accompanied by a police escort, who took the treasure- hunters to a police station -- but they were freed within hours.
 "They should have been put in jail and their machines confiscated. There are laws," said Mahmoud al-Tayeb, a former expert from Sudan's antiquities department.
 Instead, the men left without charge, and their diggers were released too.
 "It is the saddest thing," said Tayeb, who is also a professor of archaeology at the University of Warsaw.
 Tayeb believes that the real culprit is the workers' employer, someone who can pull strings and circumvent justice.
 Sudan's archaeologists warn that this was not a unique case, but part of a systematic looting of ancient sites.
 At Sai, a 12-kilometre-long river island in the Nile, hundreds of graves have been ransacked and destroyed by looters. Some of them date back to the times of the pharaohs.
 Sudan's ancient civilisations built more pyramids than the Egyptians, but many are still unexplored.
 Now, in hundreds of remote places ranging from cemeteries to temples, desperate diggers are hunting for anything to improve their daily lives.
 \- Gold fever -
 Sudan is Africa's third largest producer of gold, after South Africa and Ghana, with commercial mining bringing in $1.22 billion to the government last year.
 In the past, people also tried their luck by panning for gold at the city of Omdurman, across the river from Khartoum, where the waters of the White and Blue Niles meet.
 "We used to see older people with small sieves like the ones women use for sifting flour at home," Tayeb said, recalling times when he was a boy. "They used them to look for gold."
 But the gold they found was in tiny quantities.
 Then in the late 1990s, people saw archaeologists using metal detectors for their scientific research.
 "When people saw archeologists digging and finding things, they were convinced there was gold."
 \- 'Reason for pride' -
 Even worse, local authorities have encouraged the young and unemployed to hunt for treasures while wealthy businessmen bring in mechanical diggers alongside.
 "Out of a thousand more or less well-known sites in Sudan, at least a hundred have been destroyed or damaged," said Nour. "There is one policeman for 30 sites... and he has no communication equipment or adequate means of transport."
 For Tayeb, the root problem is not a lack of security, but rather the government's priorities.
 "It's not a question of policemen," he said. "It is a serious matter of how do you treat your history, your heritage? This is the main problem. But heritage is not a high priority for the government, so what can one do?"
 The destruction of the sites is an extra tragedy for a country long riven by civil war between rival ethnic groups, destroying a common cultural identity of a nation.
 "This heritage is vital for the unity of the Sudanese," Nour said. "Their history gives them a reason for pride."

But it still remains very much an _experimental_ treatment, one of many being studied in the rush to create a vaccine. Clinical trials have a long way to go in establishing whether or not convalescent plasma therapy works, and just earlier this month the FDA postponed its plans to announce an emergency use authorization pending further study, with Dr. Anthony Fauci and other top federal health officials arguing that the emerging data was still too weak for such a definitive move.
 In a very on-brand response, Trump took to Twitter and accused the FDA of being run by “the deep state” and impeding the vaccine approval process, which is far from the first baseless conspiracy theory he’s tweeted. Another supposed covid-19 cure he touted online and in-person, hydroxychloroquine, had its emergency use authorization later revoked after additional studies found it largely “unlikely to kill or inhibit the virus that causes COVID-19.”

Dixon dominated to the tune of 111 laps led and only surrendered the top spot to Sato with 20 to go as both contenders were close on fuel mileage. Dixon began to pressure Sato with 18 to go and made a move to the outside with 16 to go.
 Sato defended high and Dixon would not make another move before the race prematurely reached its conclusion.
 The five-time IndyCar Series champion just wanted, and somewhat expected, one more opportunity via a red flag and the resulting shootout.
 "I definitely thought with five to go, I thought they were going to immediately (red flag) it because 1) the size of the crash and 2) where it was," Dixon said. "It wasn't going to be a quick cleanup. I was kind of surprised they didn't. I kind of heard they said, 'normally we don't do that' but history would tell you that's not true either.
 "For us it would have been really good because I think the leader would have been a sitting duck ... If they got out there and had a dash with three laps to go, I think all is fair in a situation like that.
 "I can't change that. It is what it is. I think it would have been interesting to see how that played out. It would have been much better for us than Sato."
 But those are the rules, and unlike NASCAR with its green-white-checkers policy, IndyCar drivers know that races could end at any moment once they get inside the final 10 laps.
 IndyCar addressed its decision to remain under yellow with a post-race statement.
 "IndyCar makes every effort to end races under green, but in this case following the assessment of the incident, there were too few laps remaining to gather the field behind the pace car, issue a red flag and then restart."

“The future of our country, and indeed our civilization, is at stake,” Trump said last week. “These are all Democrat-run places. But these are people that don’t have any clue what they’re doing.”
 But spiking crime defies easy explanation, experts say, pointing to a toxic mix of issues facing America in 2020: an unemployment rate not seen in a generation, a pandemic that has killed more than 175,000 people, stay-at-home orders, rising anger over police brutality, intense stress, even the weather.
 And to the 300 investigators deployed to the nine cities, and the local law enforcement getting help, this isn’t about politics. It’s about reducing crime, working to solve outstanding cases and prioritizing the arrest of violent criminals. Police have welcomed the partnership, as they have with previous operations, and some activists are cautiously optimistic. Despite what Trump has claimed, the operation is routine. Some federal operations go on for months or years, and the arrests can number in the thousands.
 So far, Operation Legend has yielded over 1,000 arrests for both state and federal crimes, like murder and drug and robbery offenses, with many of the people already wanted by police. Some 200 people are facing steeper federal charges, and 400 illegal firearms were seized. Besides Kansas City, Detroit and Cleveland, the Justice Department has sent additional personnel to Chicago, Albuquerque, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Memphis, Tenn.

Nope. I'm not comparing you or any other business owner to a gangster. Absolutely not. But I will highlight one aspect of his personality.
 Bugsy Siegel saw a casino in the middle of the desert. He was a visionary. People thought he was wackadoodle, but then they didn't when the Flamingo was built and Sinatra began headlining. From tumbleweeds to today, the iconic Las Vegas Strip spans over four miles. An acre of land costs about four million dollars, and for trivia buffs, at its 2007 peak, an acre was $40 million. Bugsy landed an idea in the 3-D world that changed history, that's pretty visionary, point being, you and everyone else are, too, in varying degrees. Some use their prowess to imagine a Nitro Cold Brew. Boom. Done. Others expand perception to envision a casino, a woman on Mars, or a multibillion-dollar empire. So, let's look at two, of several, fundamental tenets of a visionary. Then decide for yourself what you and ole Bugs have in common.
 1\. Vision architect. Like an architect, seeing the vision in your mind's eye is step one. Of course, there's a lot more that happens after the vision but imagination is primo. It's a shame it took a back seat to logic because logic is basically the implementation arm for imagination, which by the way is thinking in pictures. The "picture" acts like an architectural blueprint for the conscious and subconscious mind to concretize the vision. What logical action steps would even be necessary without first a vision? Own your vision. Smell it. Taste it. See it. Feel it. If you run into a snag, consider Bugsy and the architect who'll refine the picture literally, metaphorically and imaginatively until it materializes. It's what a visionary does.
 2\. Energetic commitment. Having a vision is one thing, commitment to the vision, no matter what, is another. I'm not talking about bull-dog commitment, force can have a reverse effect. What I mean is this. There's a corresponding feeling when you imagine your vision. That feeling is energy. Committing to that vision-energy in spite of difficulties melts obstacles like the sun on an ice cube. As for the opinions of others, consider them. Remember though, most will innocently impose their limits upon you just like they did to Bugsy. The visionary journey has its highs and lows. At times you'll feel like you're floating untethered. But belief is the mindset that materializes your vision. In your alone time, live the energy of the vision. It's essential.
 So, you have zero interest in building a casino in the middle of a desert but as a business owner I'd bet you're unswervingly committed to your particular vision. Like Bugsy's, it could change the course of history. But maybe the only thing you have in common with Bugs is that you refine your vision and stay committed to it when the chips are down and against all odds. And most would say, that's a sure bet.

The dollar steadied against major currencies on Monday as traders looked to more data for a gauge on the health of the global economy and the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole retreat for guidance on the outlook for U.S. monetary policy.
 Sentiment for the greenback has improved somewhat due to supportive data on business activity and home sales, but there are still concerns that additional monetary easing may be necessary to keep economic growth on track.
 Traders in the yuan, and across the broader financial markets, are also nervously watching Sino-U.S. ties as President Donald Trump's wide-ranging diplomatic dispute with China shows no signs of abating.
 “There could be a short-term bounce in the dollar, especially against the euro,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
 “In the long term, the dollar will resume its decline because the Fed has to commit to aggressive easing for an very long time.”
 Against the euro, the dollar held steady at $1.1803, clinging onto gains made late last week.
 The British pound bought $1.3095 and traded at 90.14 pence per euro.
 The greenback fetched 0.9121 Swiss franc, holding onto a 0.5% gain from Friday.
 The yen held steady, with the dollar changing hands at 105.76 yen, showing little reaction after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe entered hospital on Monday amid speculation about his health.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will discuss monetary policy on Thursday at the opening day of the Kansas City Fed's annual symposium.
 This year the meeting will be held online, and not at the hunting and fishing resort of Jackson Hole, Wyoming because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The quantitative easing that the Fed has deployed so far has flooded financial markets with excess liquidity and weighed on the dollar.
 Last week the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies fell to the lowest in more than two years. It was last trading at 93.155, little changed from Friday.
 The world's policymakers have unleashed an unprecedented wave of monetary easing and fiscal support to offset the economic drag caused by the pandemic.
 However, many countries are now battling a second wave of infections, which could further delay a full-fledged economic recovery. As usual, investors will also be watching out for a further run of data this week for clues on the global economy, including a second estimate of U.S. GDP for the second quarter as well as weekly jobless claims and some second tier Asian indicators.
 The euro was on the defensive following disappointing manufacturing and services sector data for Europe released on Friday.
 The common currency's next major hurdle is the release of the closely-watched Ifo sentiment survey on Tuesday.
 The euro has pulled back slightly from a two-year high versus the dollar reached last week, which makes it vulnerable to short-term profit taking, some analysts say.

Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the Oversight Committee and author of the House bill, said DeJoy was using the Postal Service’s longstanding fiscal problems as an excuse “to justify sweeping and damaging changes to Postal Service operations. And we have all seen the results: national headlines about delays of days and weeks, veterans desperately waiting for their medications, sorting machines being ripped out and thrown in dumpsters.”
 Maloney’s committee on Saturday released internal Postal Service documents warning about steep declines and delays in a range of mail services since early July, shortly after DeJoy took the helm. Delays have occurred in first- class and marketing mail, periodicals and Priority Mail, the agency says in an Aug. 12 briefing prepared by Postal Service staff for DeJoy.
 “These new documents show that the delays we have all heard about are actually far worse than previously reported — and they are across the board,’' Maloney said.
 DeJoy acknowledged at the Senate hearing there has been a “dip” in service, but disputed reports of widespread problems.

Philippe Coutinho is unsure what his future holds ahead of his return to Barcelona from Bayern Munich.
 Coutinho completed his loan spell at Bayern by winning the Champions League title after a 1-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the final on Sunday.
 The Brazil international is expected to make a permanent move from Barcelona this close season, the former Liverpool star linked with a return to the Premier League.
 Coutinho, who came off the bench against PSG, said he was eager for a strong 2020-21 season – but he is unsure where that will be.
 "I haven't thought about this. I have to go back and I want to work hard to have a great year," he told Movistar+.
 "I don't know if [it will be] in Barcelona."
 As Barca finished 2019-20 trophy-less, Coutinho won a treble at Bayern, who crushed the LaLiga giants 8-2 in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.
 Coutinho scored a brace in that game and also came off the bench against PSG as Kingsley Coman's second-half header was enough in the final.
 It meant PSG were denied a maiden Champions League title, but Coutinho still had praise for his international team-mate Neymar.
 "I told him that he had a great season and he is going to fight for this and to be the best in the world," he said.

One of the things to remember is that India is a very large country in terms of its population. We also have a range of population density. What we have seen is the most densely populated areas were infected first, now we are at tier-2 cities getting infected. We still have a long way to go. I do not think the pattern of the cumulative numbers is going to change, but where the patterns play out will change as the disease spreads to different parts of the country. It is very difficult to say that we are plateauing… we are not only plateauing, but heading downwards in some places, but we are on the upswing in others.

Students in Michael Smith's election security class at Emporia State are hearing a lot about mail voting -- it is the first thing they're tackling in the brand new course.
   
 The move could not be more timely.
   
 Usually intricate discussions about election security are confined to places like political science classes or behind the scene workings in state and local elections offices.
   
 But thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, mail voting was a hot topic leading up to the primary election already. And rapidly building concerns about delays at the United States Postal Service have turned the conversation on its head.
   
 The postal service changes have been characterized by aggressive cost cutting under the leadership of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who was appointed in May. That includes cutting overtime and halting procedures designed to ensure on-time mail delivery.
   
 Meanwhile, at least one mail processing machine had been removed from sites in Wichita and Kansas City, mirroring similar moves nationally, although a USPS spokesperson insisted it was part of a pre-planned modernization effort. Cities in other states ranging from Montana to Oregon have seen mailboxes removed, as well.
   
 DeJoy walked back the moves earlier this week, saying they would be put on pause until after November.
   
 "There are some long-standing operational initiatives -- efforts that predate my arrival at the Postal Service -- that have been raised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic," he said in a statement. "To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded."
   
 But with DeJoy confirming Friday that previously removed equipment will not be returned -- like the machines in Kansas City and Wichita -- many are wondering how much of an effect the announcement will have on delays in Kansas and around the country.
   
 Smith, the Emporia State professor, says that data shows turnout is boosted an average of 2%, although he acknowledged these are extraordinary times.
   
 And it isn't necessarily the case that such an impact would benefit one party over another, he added.
   
 "We've heard a lot lately that vote by mail benefits Democrats, that Republicans are seeking to suppress it for that reason," Smith said. "If they are in fact seeking to do that, they may be mistaken -- the data does not back that up."
   
 But some are worried that the mixed messaging that residents have received could confuse them when it comes time to request a mail ballot, decreasing those who choose to vote via that method.
   
 And there are other, non-USPS points of confusion for voters seeking to cast their ballot by mail, as well, outside of the constant stream of headlines about the postal service.
   
 The Kansas Secretary of State's Office has said that there has been a slight uptick in calls from concerned citizens about mail voting in light of the post office news.
   
 But even more voters are calling to ask about mailers that have been sent to many residents from a third-party entity, the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Voter Information, containing an application for a mail ballot.
   
 Some residents were concerned this could be a scam.. But state officials have since confirmed they are not fraudulent, as confusing to voters as they might be.
   
 Still, caution is urged.
   
 "Our office encourages Kansas voters to be very cautious in providing information to third parties," said Katie Koupal, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office.
   
 There also is the fact that absentee voting demands more of residents than going to the polls in person.
   
 Voters must request an absentee ballot in a timely manner, which in Kansas means that it must be received by county elections officials one week before the election date. For the general election, that means it has to be received by Oct. 27.
   
 Numerous speakers during the Democratic National Convention encouraging voters request and obtain their ballot as soon as possible and return it immediately.
   
 It is expected this messaging will be a cornerstone of the party's get out the vote push going forward. Ben Meers, executive director of the Kansas Democratic Party, said in an interview earlier this month that officials were planning such a push in October, when most voters will be mailing back their ballots.
   
 And while the state Republican Party has not advocated its members vote by mail, some local GOP committees, including the Shawnee County Republican Party, have shared information about how to use the absentee system.
   
 But the secretary of state's office is encouraging voters to allow more time given the increased volume of applications. Once completed, ballots can be returned to a voter's polling place or county elections office, as well.
   
 "With the increase in advance by mail ballot applications for the primary, which will presumably continue into the general election, our message to voters is to be proactive with all election-related activities -- registering to vote, requesting an advance by mail ballot if that is how you wish to vote and in returning your ballot," Koupal said.
   
 Other rules can trip up voters, including requirements that they sign the ballot in the proper place.
   
 "Vote-by-mail is not a good way to vote for people who are lackadaisical about following rules or procrastinate, because that is where the process goes wrong, bluntly," said Patrick Miller, professor of political science at the University of Kansas.
   
 Assuming voters follow those rules, Smith said he believed the rhetoric surrounding the post office could actually increase turnout, with groups who may feel as though their votes might be suppressed more motivated than before.
   
 "If voters feel singled out and targeted, they are more likely to vote," he said.
   
 And with advance mail voting a staple of Kansas elections for some time, albeit not at the levels seen during the primary election, many voters may be confident in the system.
   
 This isn't true everywhere, Smith said, with voters of color not always liable to trust white election officials. But while residents in urban areas are bracing for mail voting complications, voters in rural areas likely believe problems lie elsewhere, not in their backyard.
   
 "A majority of Kansans now live in the six most populated counties," Smith said. "They are more urban and they are more diverse. So some of those issues you'd see in a bigger state, you'll see there, as well."
   
 And while some candidates may tailor their messaging to account for issues with the USPS, Miller said that the responsibility is heightened for voters, not candidates.
   
 "Voters need to be aware that it is your job as the voter to defend your vote -- no one else is going to do that for you," he said. "And no matter how you choose to vote, whether it is mail or early and in-person, you need to follow the rules and act responsibly to protect your ballot. And I think even with all the shenanigans happening with the post office right now, I think if voters can follow the rules responsibly, then vote by mail can be very successful."

It’s abundantly clear from the beginning that Arquette doesn’t just see this quest as a way to get some headlines.

Even the most callous of wrestling fans will likely find themselves rooting for him as he seeks training, works with luchadors in Mexico and begins to get in shape.

Dixon was also frustrated because he believes Sato would have run out of fuel over the final laps had the race stayed green. That was the only reason his team allowed Sato by in the first place since the leader burns more fuel than a trailing car.
 "Ultimately, if it had gone green all the way maybe he would have run out of fuel," Dixon said. "It seems like from our point of view that was definitely possible.
 "I definitely thought where they did lean out (use a fuel conservation setting) for a period for a lap or three-quarters of a lap, that's where we got the big run on them, that's the pace they would have had to run until the end."
 Rahal Letterman Lanigan principal Bobby Rahal disputed that notion after the race.
 "He had plenty," Rahal said. "He had plenty. He only stopped one lap before Dixon did the final stop. I'm pretty sure it was one lap before. It was awesome. Dixon came in with Graham or Graham in with Dixon.
 "We were good. That was never an issue."
 Sato conceded that Dixon only caught-up once he leaned-out briefly, but he never felt truly at-risk of running out of fuel.
 "After the restart, when I got the lead, I heard a voice from the pits basically say 'you're using too much fuel.' I had to back off with a leaner mixture," Sato said. "You can see immediately (that) Scott caught me and tried to give it a go.
 "At that point I had to switch back to the maximum power. He was three cars, four cars behind so I go with the leaner mixture again. We were close. I was hitting a number. If you scan my radio, we were on the number. Even if we (stayed green), I think we were okay."
 So where did Dixon's performance go awry? Perhaps he shouldn't have let Sato by. Maybe Dixon should have pressed harder when they got side by side.
 Those are the 'what its' that will come up next week during their post-race debrief.  
 "When we ran the first couple laps after the last restart, we couldn't get the fuel mileage we needed to finish the race," Dixon said. "We went to a leaner mixture (and) just kind of sat there. We didn't think they were going to make it on fuel.
 "Seemed like there was a hesitation maybe about 15 to go or 12 to go where I got beside him on the straight. It's like they started to go to a lean mixture (and) then they decided it was just too slow, so they kind of went back at it.
 "I probably should have been a little more aggressive on that high side there. I think he would have just run me up anyway -- which maybe would have put both of us in the fence -- or maybe just me.
 "Maybe we should have gone harder. Maybe we would have run out of fuel and been in the same position. I don't know what the right call was."
 Dixon was asked where he wanted to be with five laps to go and he said 'leading' because you never know what could happen late in the race.
 His No. 9 team was just reminded the hard way.
 "It's definitely hard to swallow for the team," Dixon said.

From snorting wasabi up his nose to willingly allow himself to be tattooed while Henry Rollins was driving the vehicle he was being tattooed in, Steve-O has done some truly stupid and insane things. In fact, this isn't the first time he's climbed anything since he climbed a crane to protest Seaworld at one point. That instant might have turned out worse if not for the fact that he's a celebrity since he was sentenced to 30 days in jail but only ended up spending 8 hours in the clink. That definitely sounds a bit unfair since the average citizen might find themselves spending the full month behind bars, especially since the average citizen hasn't amassed the kind of money that Steve-O has. But this current stunt didn't manage to get him in trouble for one reason or another as it could have been that he had permission or those in charge figured it wouldn't do any good since he might just turn around and do it again. But at this point, nothing is really that surprising when it comes to celebrities unless they're held to the same level of accountability of course, that comes as kind of a shock sometimes.

Reuters) - Asian shares advanced for a second straight session on Monday, underpinned by coronavirus hopes after the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the use of blood plasma from recovered patients as a treatment option.
 The announcement from the U.S. FDA of a so-called emergency use authorization came on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where Donald Trump will be nominated to lead his party for four more years.
 E-Mini futures for the S&P500 gained 0.3%.
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan jumped 0.65%, moving toward a six-month high touched last week.
 Japan's Nikkei reversed early losses to be last up 0.4%. Chinese shares rose too with the blue-chip CSI 300 index adding 0.8%.
 South Korea's KOSPI, which has been on a slippery slope since hitting a more than two-year peak earlier this month, climbed 0.9%.
 Sentiment was also supported by a Financial Times report that the Trump administration is considering by-passing normal U.S. regulatory standards to fast-track an experimental coronavirus vaccine from the UK for use in America ahead of the presidential election.
 “Markets are opening this morning to optimism on the therapeutics front after the FDA authorized the use of blood plasma from COVID-19 survivors to treat sick patients,” said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp.
 “Not the Covid-19 cure all the world is hoping for, but it is another positive step to help patient recovery time and get people back on their feet quicker.”
 Analysts still urged caution with Wall Street indexes already at record highs even as the world economy struggled to recover from the once-in-a-century pandemic.
 “With risks rising somewhat and September a full month for policy, the end of summer is a good time to cross-check valuations and to consider both threats and opportunities,” said JPMorgan cross asset analyst John Normand.
 Normand pointed to talks of a U.S. fiscal package, Fed's upcoming policy review next month and the ramping up of the U.S. election campaign as risk events over coming weeks.
 Looming large over this week was a keenly anticipated address by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Kansas City Fed Jackson Hole symposium, where he will talk on the Feds monetary policy framework review.
 “This takes on even more significance after the markets evident disappointment last week,” said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at Melbourne-based National Australia Bank.
 The Fed's July meeting minutes last week barely made a mention of its policy outlook while “failing to give succour to expectations” that its September meeting would reveal a formal commitment to new outcome-based' forward guidance, Attrill added.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he would follow public health advisers’ advice if they called for a national shutdown should he take office and the coronavirus had not abated.
 I would be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives. We cannot get the country moving until we control the virus, Biden said in an interview broadcast Sunday night on ABC News.
 Asked specifically whether he’d push a national shutdown if scientists said it was necessary, Biden replied: I would shut it down. The former vice president has previously called for the nation’s governors to impose mask mandates in their states, effectively a national mask mandate. But when he made that call, Biden avoided saying he’d attempt to use a nationally applicable executive order himself.
 The former vice president’s remarks came as part of his first joint interview with vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. The pair accepted their party’s nominations during a virtual convention last week. On Monday, Republicans begin their convention to nominate Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for a second term.
 Biden laughed when asked about Trump’s recent assertion that the only way he’d lose was if the election were rigged, and the Democratic challenger dismissed any notions that Trump wouldn’t leave the White House voluntarily if he loses.
 The American people will not let that happen, he said. No one’s going to allow that to happen. Both Biden and Harris downplayed their bitter debate encounter last summer during the Democratic primary. Harris, a California senator, levelled deeply personal criticism against Biden for his opposition in the 1970s to federally mandated busing to desegregate public schools and remarks he’d made about having worked amicably alongside racist senators when he first came to Washington.
 The first dark-skinned woman on a major party national ticket, Harris said she and Biden are on the same page on race amid the nation’s ongoing reckoning with systemic racism.
 There are real racial disparities that are rooted in systemic racism, Harris said, noting wealth gaps and the disproportionate effects of Covid-19 on Black and Hispanic communities. Biden, she said, is addressing these truths, he speaks these truths. Biden said, looking back, he understands how Harris, who was among the minority students bused in the 1970s, would rebuke him. But he also said she and others might not have known his full record on civil rights. He said he, as a 77-year-old white man, cannot understand her lived experiences and that she, a 55-year-old daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, can’t understand his.
 But, he said, they have the same value set and are on the same page about what the possibilities are right now. Likewise, they downplayed policy differences that emerged when they were primary rivals, especially on health care. Biden has consistently backed adding a public option to existing private insurance markets. Harris signed on to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ bill that would create a single-payer government insurance system to replace private insurance.
 I signed on to bills that were about great ideas to fix the problem, Harris told ABC, arguing that she and Biden are completely aligned on making sure everyone has health care. Biden called any differences tactical but said, We both believe that health care is a right, not a privilege.

NEW YORK (AP) — A decade ago, Katy Perry could sing the alphabet and top the music charts.
 Her name was synonymous with being No. 1 on the Billboard chart, as the pop star logged hit after hit after hit with anthems like “Teenage Dream,” “Firework,” “Roar” and more.
 But as the saying goes, when you’re on top, the only way to go is down.
 That was part of Perry’s experience roughly three years ago when she released “Witness,” which had some success but didn’t dominate the charts like she’s used to doing. Though first single “Chained to the Rhythm” became a Top 5 hit, the other singles fizzled, and the star’s popularity dwindled as newcomers, mainly budding rap stars, took over the music scene.
 “For me in 2017, 2018, I went through a reckoning of self and really re- prioritized what was important and my association with validation, or my relationship with validation. There was just a shift that happened in my life and my career. I wasn’t getting as high on my own supply as I used to anymore,” Perry said. “It’s like I had been to the top of the mountain. I’d seen the view. I had gotten too used to it. So, of course, the universe decided to come and say, ‘All right sweetie, let’s figure this one out.'
 "I definitely had to go on a real emotional, psychological and spiritual journey during those years to find my smile, ‘cause I lost it,” Perry continued. “That’s why the record is called ‘Smile.’”

I remember reading the “100 years ago” section and thinking how cool it was to learn about what was going on in the news such a long time ago. Now that I’m an old man it kinda just makes me sad because 1920 wasn’t that long before I was born. How about making an old man feel younger by going back in history a little further? At least back to the start of your paper when it was The Chester Times in 1876.
 END THE POLITICS
 I think the 76ers would have been better served worrying about basketball and representing the name on the front of their Jersey. And all the politics and the slogans on the back of their jerseys. Let’s go Flyers.
 VOTERS PLEASE THINK
 If we were voting for the nicest person to be president then Joe Biden would probably win. Obviously our President Trump can be too direct and blunt at times. Yes he has a huge ego. However do we want a nice guy or an effective person to be our leader? The most important factor is who can continue building an economy that was booming pre-COVID. All races and genders shared the lowest unemployment numbers in many years. Vets are now treated as they should be by the VA. The list of accomplishments goes on. What can Joe really say he has accomplished in 40 plus--years of politics? Why did Obama take until he had no choice but to endorse his former V.P. for president? Maybe he didn’t think he was the person for the job. So please vote for the person who can keep the economy going.

 STUPID AND SELFISH
 The selfishness that is gripping our country is extremely prevalent in Delaware County to all these people who are whining that the schools aren’t going to open and they’re going to have to have online learning. They are proving that they don’t care about the students at all. All they care about is our own selfish wants and desires. This is proven by the fact that all these colleges now who are opening up are having COVID cases pop up everywhere. And if these people think that that’s not going to happen in secondary schools and elementary schools, then they’re stupid as well as selfish. All they had to do is look at what’s going on in colleges to realize that in-person learning is not an option right now.

One—Students are expected to toe the line. Stepping out leads to trouble, to the point that students don’t bother to give feedback, not out of laziness or unresponsiveness, but out of a sense that what they say does not matter to those in authority. “Why would we feedback, when none of it is taken into consideration? Why should we respond to a survey that is dismissed by lecturers and supervisors who repeat the same cycle of top-down instruction every year?”
