Bristol’s mayor said it meant the council’s funding gap was now “in the ballpark” of £20million – about a quarter of the doomsday figure previously revealed.
 Speaking at a fortnightly press conference on Wednesday (July 8), Mr Rees said: “We continue to face a challenging situation.
 “We had an £80million gap. That has now changed because of the government announcement of an extra £500million for local government and covering 75 per cent of the costs of the lost revenue.
 “We are working out how that plays itself out in our finances.
 “It is not as bad as it was but it is still bad.
 “We shouldn’t think this is a good day for local government finance.

After the UK accounting watchdog, Financial Reporting Council (FRC) asked the Big Four to split their audit and consulting businesses, Indian firms are nervous about steps NFRA, the Indian regulator, could take given the scrutiny the Big Four are in after a slew of corporate frauds. National Financial Reporting Authority had recently sought information from the large firms including the big four — Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG—around their revenue split from audit and non-audit service lines. “The UK watchdog’s ruling will definitely create pressure on other regulators to follow suit. We have no option but to wait and watch,” says a Big Four partner. In India out of the top firms, PwC, Deloitte and Grant Thornton are better prepared to separate businesses, if the need arises, after they announced that they won’t do non-audit projects with audit clients. Experts say that the key point the firms are delving into is—what does the regulator mean by ‘operational separation’. What makes the situation unique in India is the fact that these firms operate their audit business through legally separate affiliates in pursuance of the ICAI rules, while in the UK, all service lines operate under one firm. “In India, audit and non-audit services are effectively not only operationally split as is being suggested in the UK, but also legally split into separate entities already. Issue in India is to actually bring it all together (affiliate firms) so that the entire enterprise can be regulated as one. It will be a massive mistake to think we need to copy the UK,” said Vishesh Chandiok, managing partner, Grant Thornton. “Let’s first walk, before we can begin to run.” In February, MCA had sought comments from all the auditors on problems in the auditing industry including the economic concentration of the big four firms. In May, MCA constituted a 7-member committee to examine the issues related to audit independence and accountability in India. The top firms have been anticipating this move for years given the sustained high-pitched drive by regulators, investors and the media against the Big Four after a string of corporate failures and frauds, the latest being German payment company, Wirecard. So the firms have spent the time successfully pivoting to a broader non-audit portfolio (includeing consulting, tax and transactions advisory) and shrinking the audit business. “The regulators need to understand that we work a large number of audit clients so we don’t have to depend on a few of them like smaller audit firms have to. The nuisance of doing non-audit work for our audit clients is so much that we have steered clear of it,” says audit head of a Big Four firm. The large complex audits that large firms do require multidisciplinary skills in tax, forensics and technology. If the firms are split, the audit firms will have to buy these services from other vendors hindering audit quality and increasing risk for clients, say experts. Outside of big six — EY, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, Grant Thornton and BDO — there are less than 25 Indian firms with more than 20 partners. Many believe that operationally splitting the large firms won’t be a big problem. “In India, we operate through affiliate firms, and in the last 4-5 years we have made sure that service lines don’t co-mingle with each other. Even then, if the regulator wants us to set up a separate server or even sing ‘Strawberry Fields Forever,’ we are happy to do that,” says CEO of a large firm. The Big 4 audit firms, between them, handle a 479 assignments of 1,813 companies (26 per cent) listed on NSE as on 9th December, 2019, for which auditor details were available for FY 2019-20.

"I found out two days ago that I'm pregnant," Amy Schumer says tearfully at the start of the "Expecting Amy." "Maybe I'll document it or something." That translates into a three-part docuseries, and a test of one's fandom level toward the comic/actor, offering a very-personal account of her gestation process for two things: The baby she had last year, and a Netflix stand-up special.
 Primarily shot by Schumer and her husband, Chris Fischer, using their phones, viewers should be forewarned that Schumer had an extremely difficult pregnancy, and this HBO Max presentation illustrates that by showing her throwing up in a variety of locales. In fact, it's hard not to think about Fischer snatching up his phone every time his wife becomes nauseous so he can capture the moment, which speaks to a certain level of commitment to the process.
 The degree of personal detail is a testament, in theory, to Schumer's unflinching openness, and highlights the balance associated with juggling a pregnancy and work -- in this case, a high-profile career touring clubs to hone her material.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to cut off funding to schools that do not open in the fall and criticized a federal health agency's guidelines for reopening schools as "very tough & expensive."
 The Republican president, who is seeking re-election in November, accused Democrats of wanting to keep schools shut for political reasons, despite a surge in coronavirus cases across the country.
 "The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if U.S. schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children & families. May cut off funding if not open!" Trump said on Twitter, pointing to schools reopening in some European countries with no problems.
 It was not clear what specific federal aid the Republican president had in mind. States are responsible for primary and secondary education under the U.S. Constitution, but the federal government provides some supplementary funding.
 Trump also took aim at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation's health protection agency whose director sits on the White House coronavirus task force.
 "I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!" Trump said in a separate Twitter post.
 The White House did not elaborate on which CDC guidelines Trump took issue with.
 The CDC has recommended a number of considerations for schools, including testing, dividing students into small groups, serving packaged lunches in classrooms instead of cafeterias, and minimizing sharing of school supplies. It advised sneeze guards and partitions be put in place when social distancing is not possible, and that seats be spaced at least six feet apart.
 On Tuesday, Trump held meetings about school reopenings at the White House and said he would pressure state governors to open schools in the fall.
 The White House coronavirus task force was meeting at the Department of Education on Wednesday and will hold a news briefing afterward.
 Business and conservative groups have urged reopening schools safely as important to getting parents back to work and reviving the U.S. economy.
 Educators say socialization and other benefits such as school food programs are critically important. Experts have also shown online learning exacerbates the divide between poorer and more wealthy Americans, who have greater access to technology.
 The alarming surge in cases in the United States, however, has raised concerns about the increased risk of spread of the virus by children to vulnerable adults at home as well as to older teachers and school staff.

Technology shares boosted Wall Street's main indexes on Wednesday as early signs of an economic rebound offset fears of another lockdown due to a jump in coronavirus cases across the country.
 Safe-haven gold rose more than 1% as the number of confirmed U.S. cases surpassed 3 million, affecting nearly one of every 100 Americans. California, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas broke their previous daily record highs for new infections.
 "We expect the tug of war between better economic data and concerns over rising COVID-19 cases to continue through the month unless we get better daily virus numbers, and/or news on a vaccine," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
 The Nasdaq notched an intraday record high on Tuesday but all the three main stock indexes finished lower as investors booked profits following a strong run on the back of upbeat economic data over the last few days.
 Bolstering hopes of a post-pandemic rebound, analysts said any setback in business activity due to the recent surge in infections would be short term, leaving their long-term forecasts for economic growth unchanged.
 Markets also appeared to be in a wait-and-watch mode before the beginning of the second-quarter earnings season, which kicks off next week with reports from the big Wall Street banks.
 Quarterly earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to plunge about 43% year-on-year, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
 "Wall Street is looking ahead to 2021 earnings and pretty much ignoring 2020," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
 Technology sectors firmed 1.2%, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors.
 At 10:52 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 121.80 points, or 0.47%, at 26,011.98, the S&P 500 was up 18.26 points, or 0.58%, at 3,163.58. The Nasdaq Composite was up 114.52 points, or 1.11%, at 10,458.41.
 Biogen Inc jumped 5% after the company said it submitted the marketing application for its experimental Alzheimer's disease therapy, aducanumab.
 Allstate Corp slipped 3.2% as the U.S. insurer said it would buy National General Holdings Corp for about $4 billion, scaling up its auto insurance business. National General shares surged 64.6%.
 Levi Strauss & Co fell 6.4% as the denim apparel maker cautioned its business would be hit in the second half of the year, even as its sales have been improving at its reopened stores.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.46-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.40-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
 The S&P index recorded 16 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 78 new highs and 13 new lows. (Reporting by C Nivedita and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel ad Shounak Dasgupta)

 “Unless this is sorted, we are on the edge of one of the biggest concentrations of power in the country in decades, and that’s not an overly dramatic way of saying it.
 “What we have seen writ large over the last few weeks is that local government is drip-fed money and announcements, so in some sense all the power is in Westminster and Whitehall which can be very deceptive.
 “If government announces money from Whitehall and then gives that directly to community-based or local organisations, those organisations are then accountable to Whitehall, the funders.
