Giving Comfort


  The USNS Comfort departed Norfolk a week ago, bringing on its journey to New York City the hopes and well wishes of our region and the whole nation. New York continues to be epicenter of the coronavirus crisis and it was hoped that the hospital ship would help alleviate the suffering there.


  So happy were the people of New York for the ship to arrive that they greeted with loud cheers when it entered the harbor there — a celebration audible on video circulating on social media. However, news reports late this week indicated the ship only had a handful of patients on board.


  The Comfort was sent to New York not to handle COVID-19 patients but to provide excess medical capacity to the rest of the city. One expects health officials to make full use of those resources — a helping hand from Hampton Roads — in the coming days and weeks.

As COVID Fear Spreads, Dems Ramp Up Pressure on ICE To Release Illegals

NEW YORK (AP) — Scarce supplies of medical equipment are leading to growing competition within the U.S. and among nations, in what one French politician called a “worldwide treasure hunt.”The governor of New York state, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, vowed to seize unused ventilators from private hospitals and companies, while President Donald Trump said he was preventing the export of N95 respirator masks and surgical gloves, a move he said was necessary to ensure that medical supplies are available in the U.S.The number of people infected in the U.S. exceeded a quarter-million, and the death toll climbed past 7,000, with New York state alone accounting for more than 2,900 dead, an increase of over 560 in just one day. Most of the dead are in New York City, where hospitals are swamped with patients.Worldwide, confirmed infections rose past 1 million and deaths topped 58,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say both numbers are seriously undercounted because of the lack of testing, mild cases that were missed and governments that are underplaying the crisis.Europe’s three worst-hit countries — Italy, Spain and France — accounted for more than 32,000 dead, or over half the global toll.In China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected in December, flags flew at half mast and air raid sirens sounded for three minutes on a day of remembrance for the dead. China has cautiously lifted restrictions amid dropping numbers of infections and on Saturday, reported just one new confirmed case in the epicenter of Wuhan and 18 others among people arriving from abroad. There were four new deaths for an official total of 3,326.Among those joining the observance in Wuhan, Sheng Xiaohang said that after experiencing the outbreak, “everyone has grown up.”“I think everyone’s outlooks on life, on the world, and values were overthrown," said Sheng, who left her media job to organize a volunteer organization to deliver medical materials to Wuhan hospitals.South Korea extended for two weeks guidelines urging people to stick to social distancing as infections continue to grow in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.During a meeting on anti-virus measures on Saturday, Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun expressed concern over rising infections linked to recent arrivals.The economic damage from the lockdowns and closures mounted. The U.S. snapped its record-breaking hiring streak of nearly 10 years when the government reported that employers slashed over 700,000 jobs last month. But the true picture is far worse, because the figures do not include the last two weeks, when 10 million thrown-out-of-work Americans applied for unemployment benefits.A more immediate concern was the shortage of masks and gloves, leading to fierce competition among buyers from Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere and aggressive measures such as New York state Gov. Andrew Cuomo's plan to take ventilators that aren’t being used. Cuomo says New York, the nation’s worst hot spot, could run out of ventilators next week.“If they want to sue me for borrowing their excess ventilators to save lives, let them sue me,” Cuomo said. He promised to eventually return the equipment or compensate the owners.Worldwide shortages have caused health care workers to fall sick and forced doctors in Europe to make life-or-death decisions about which patients get a breathing machine. The search for supplies and bidding wars among buyers have created what Valerie Pecresse, president of France's battered Île-de- France region, called a “worldwide treasure hunt."The governor of the U.S. state of Louisiana said New Orleans could exhaust its supply by Tuesday.Amid swelling cases, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has gone from one unit dedicated to coronavirus patients to seven. Nurse Christen Hyde said nurses call families twice a day to give updates on their relatives, in some cases delivering bleak news.“To have to call a family member and tell them that their family member is not doing well and they are probably going to be passing soon is just devastating,” said Hyde, who has had four patients die.Along with blocking mask exports, Trump announced new guidelines that call for everyone to wear makeshift face coverings such as T-shirts and bandannas when leaving the house, especially in areas hit hard by the pandemic, like New York. But the president said he had no intention of following the advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“It’s a recommendation, they recommend it,” Trump told reporters. “I just don’t want to wear one myself.”The change comes amid concerns from health officials that those without symptoms can spread the virus, especially in places like grocery stores or pharmacies. Officials stressed that medical-grade masks should be reserved for health workers and others on the front lines of the pandemic, with critical equipment in short supply.Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe with about 14,700 dead, continued seeing signs that infections and deaths might be leveling off. France reported a surge of more than 1,000 deaths Friday, bringing its overall toll to more than 6,500.“The work is extremely tough and heavy,” said Philippe Montravers, an anesthesiologist in Paris. “We’ve had doctors, nurses, caregivers who got sick, infected ... but who have come back after recovering. It’s a bit like those World War I soldiers who were injured and came back to fight.”Spain recorded over 900 new deaths, down slightly from the record it hit a day earlier. The carnage almost certainly included large numbers of elderly who authorities admit are not getting access to the country’s limited breathing machines, which are being used first on healthier, younger patients.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with health problems, it can cause pneumonia. Over 200,000 people have recovered, by Johns Hopkins’ count.___Smith reported from Providence, Rhode Island, Villenueve reported from Albany, New York, and Santana reported from New Orleans.

The American-Statesman and more than two dozen other Austin media outlets are joining together today to support All Together ATX, a community fund-raising drive to help those with economic or health hardships created by the coronavirus crisis.


   


  The Austin Community Foundation and United Way for Greater Austin are leading the effort to raise money for local organizations already on the front lines of helping with basic needs like providing food, medical needs, employment and child care.


   


  Donations are being accepted online at AllTogetherATX.com from individuals, companies and other foundations.


      


  The fundraising drive is getting a boost with an all-day digital telethon hosted by the American-Statesman and more than two dozen Austin-area TV and radio stations and other media outlets.


   


  Leaders of the effort said money will be distributed in a phased approach, focused first on local organizations with clients most affected and later on long-term recovery and sustainability for the nonprofit sector. Grant distributions will begin May 1 and will range up to $25,000.


   


  Applications for grants are now being accepted at the AllTogetherATX website; the deadline to apply is 5 p.m. April 10.


   


  "Many individuals and families in Central Texas were already struggling with economic, social and health hardships before the COVID-19 outbreak shook our community, and this crisis will only further widen the opportunity gap," said Mike Nellis, CEO of Austin Community Foundation. "For these reasons, Austin Community Foundation and United Way for Greater Austin are working to quickly deploy philanthropic capital to nonprofit organizations working on the front lines by supporting local workers and families most affected by this pandemic."


   


  Said David C. Smith, CEO of United Way for Greater Austin: "For nearly 100 years, United Way for Greater Austin has been dedicated to those in our community who are suffering and creating opportunity for all people, children and families. The work we've been doing all along has prepared us for this moment. Unprecedented times call for unprecedented action. With children out of school, businesses temporarily closing and many workers out of work, your partnership and support is needed now more than ever. As we respond to this crisis, you can provide fellow community members with critical, immediate needs like emergency assistance, health services, child care and food."


   


  The American-Statesman and its parent company also have launched a website designed to boost restaurants and other local businesses struggling during the coronavirus shutdown. The website, supportlocal.usatoday.com, allows users to buy gift cards from local businesses for use at a later time.

Shirley was well known for her cooking talents and was a 4-H leader for many years and shared her talent with anyone who was willing to learn. Shirley sewed her children’s clothing for many, many years with the help of her mother. The colorful polyester designs and button will never be forgotten by any of us who wore those clothes that were made from scratch and with love. Some of the daughters first store bought dresses that they ever wore was... their wedding dress.  


  A family vacation in 1968 to Washington consisted of having 3 adults and 5 kids crammed in the same vehicle, on the way home Shirley brought home a part Angora and Persian kitten that she would name Pretty. Pretty was the only cat Shirley ever allowed to live in the house; Pretty provided many kittens for the farm that were always born in the house, usually in a hidden area, like the back of a closet. At any mealtime we would always hear a friendly reminder from mom... “put your scraps in the bucket for the cats”!  


  Shirley is survived by her children: daughter Judy Dosch and her husband Jim; son Dean Knie and his wife Patty; daughter Jannelle Cowles-Nelson and her husband Bill; daughter Jo Moonchild; daughter Joan Roesch and her husband Mick; 12 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. Shirley was preceded in death by her husband Herb; her parents; her siblings; a stillborn granddaughter; son-in-law Tom Cowles and grandson Jared Weischedel. www.spitzerfuneralhome.com

“You’re just as important to our football team as any coach or myself because you bring our game to life. I appreciate what you’ve done through all the years. We’ve got some strong teams. You’re going to be the voice of all of this and, hopefully, we’ll both end up on top with you leading the way.”


  Rima felt the love and was very appreciative of everyone who called in Monday, starting with Jacobson and Farley.


  “That really meant a lot to me, first for them to take the time to listen to the show, and then to actually call in and share their appreciation and thoughts,” Rima said.


  “Those are two tremendous coaches, tremendous people, and they’ve both been really good to me as the play-by-play guy for their team. That was really special to hear from them right away.”


  One of Rima’s first gigs in the sports broadcasting business was in Oelwein at KOEL. Back then, “the Sports Guy” was a jack of all trades as he owned a sporting goods store and Shooky’s Sports Bar & Grill in Oelwein while still working for KOEL. Then in the mid ’90s, Rima took over as the play-by-play voice of UNI basketball and football.


  OPR came around later, starting on July 31, 2006. Rima still remembers the day he started a small radio show that turned into the biggest in the Cedar Valley.


  “I think the thing that gives me a lot of pride is what we built really from the ground floor up from day one,” Rima noted. “When I did my very first show, to think of jumping on a station that was going to be the only sports talk on that station. Then to build up the listening audience we did, and having it go to a two-hour show.”


  Rima also mentioned the opportunity to give up-and-coming sports broadcasters a chance to learn the business alongside him as an in-studio producer and co- host. Everyone on the show had a sports nickname. John Leo was “the Sports Lion,” Logan Blackman was “the Sports Beast,” and Joel Wauters was “the Sports Cat.” All of them learned from “the Sports Guy,” who is grateful for the 14 years that the show was on the air.


  Rima will now have more time to enjoy life, relax, and spend time with family, including 10 grandkids.


  “When you’re committed to it, like I missed a lot of my grandkids’ events that I would’ve liked to have gone to,” Rima said. “It’s certainly going to free me up where I can spend more time with the grandkids. I’m looking forward to going to their events and seeing them participate in their sports and the things that they’re involved in.”


  At the end of the day, Rima put it best that he had the time of his life while doing what he loves. He built something that he could call his own in OPR with great pride in covering Iowa sports.


  “From day one, I wanted the emphasis to be on Iowa sports,” Rima said. “There was always more than enough to talk about. I’m just proud of what it grew into to a two-hour show, five days a week.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — It may be an odd gesture at a time of social distancing, but President Donald Trump is leaning into his plea to Congress to restore full tax benefits prized by business for fine dining and schmoozing. Trump is seizing on the pandemic crisis to push for an item on his economic wish list: full tax deductions for business meals in restaurants and for other entertainment expenses.


  Tax relief for fine dining and the like clashes with the reality of social separation urged by the government as a critical measure to contain the coronavirus. Restaurants and sports stadiums, with their corporate boxes, sit empty across the country.


  But Trump argues that restoring the corporate tax deductions could help shore up the pulverized restaurant industry. It was Trump's own tax law in 2017, which sliced the tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%, that reduced or eliminated those same deductions. It was a rare provision that wasn't business-friendly.


  The deductions tend to favor higher-end restaurants, the part of the industry that's been hardest hit by the economic dislocation. Mass-market eateries and fast food and pizza chains have been more likely to hold things together with takeout and delivery business.


  "This is a great time to bring it back," Trump said of the tax break during a White House briefing Wednesday. "Otherwise a lot of these restaurants are going to have a hard time reopening."


  If the tax relief comes, the president said, it will "open up" the restaurant business, and, "in fact, I think the restaurant business will be actually bigger and better than it is right now." Trump has repeatedly predicted that the economy will rebound robustly, lifted by consumers' "great pent-up demand."


  Restoring the dining deduction could help at least the tonier part of the restaurant industry — but down the road and depending on the strength of the recovery and consumer spending, some experts believe.


  "Do I think it's a massive help? I don't," said Jonathan Maze, editor-in- chief of Restaurant Business magazine. "In theory, you could see it help as business travel picks backs up. Maybe it gets a few people into restaurants who might not have done so before."


  By far the biggest factor, Maze noted, will be the money that goes into consumers' pockets, including from direct cash payments from the government. Whether they remain too frightened to go to restaurants is an uncomfortable question.


  "While the restaurant industry sorely needs federal assistance, restoring deductibility is an action that should fall further down the priority list," said Kevin Schimpf, senior manager for industry research at Technomic. "With so many business people and office staff working remotely for the foreseeable future, it's unlikely this action would have much short-term benefit."


  Congressional leaders haven't weighed in yet on Trump's proposal.


  Trump's 2017 tax law, whisked through by the then-Republican majority in Congress, cut the 100% deduction for business meals in half and eliminated it entirely for most entertainment expenses at venues like sporting and cultural events.


  From pricey corporate boxes at sports stadiums to Double-A baseball games in small towns, the entertainment deduction was a prized perk for companies. Some companies continued to spend without the tax incentive, seeing the benefits from entertaining as a payoff in future revenue. But the tax change had a bite.


  There's also a psychological effect. When something's deductible, even in part, people think it's less expensive; the government, in effect, is picking up part of the cost.

WATERLOO – MercyOne has accelerated its virtual visit strategy in light of the COVID-19 crisis. A virtual visit allows patients to meet with their local MercyOne provider through video chat without ever leaving the comfort and security of their home. Several family medicine and pediatrics care providers are already up and running, with more to follow, including some specialists.


  “It takes a lot of coordination to bring this to life in a week’s time, and our team has done an exceptional job,” said Jeff Halverson, vice president of MercyOne Medical Group Northeast Iowa. “We’ve been doing some of this work already in Behavioral Health Care, and the expansion of this service allows us to provide care to patients while they stay home during the COVID-19 response.”
