ORRVILLE -- There was lots of action Saturday night at Wayne County Speedway on Santmyer Energy night.  


  The Pine Tree Towing & Recovery Sprints starting the night off with Wooster's Dean Jacobs taking the lead from his outside front row starting spot. The action came to a stop as the field started the second lap when Steve Butler got sideways and collected Troy Kingan and Dylan Kingan. All three drivers were OK, but were finished for the night. As the race went back to green, Broc Martin took second from Chris Myers and started his chase after Jacobs. Henry Malcuit motored past Myers on the next lap for third as fast qualifier Tyler Street moved into fourth on lap eight. A caution flag waved on lap nine for sixth-running Ricky Peterson and before the race started back up, the red came out for a fan in the stands.  


  Once the race went back to green and stayed green the rest of the way, Jacobs held off Martin and started to pull away. Martin tried every line he could to stay with Jacobs but could not track him down. With his fourth win, Jacobs expands his point lead. Malcuit ended up with a season-best third-place finished followed by Street with Jason Dolick taking fifth. Jacobs and Dolick captured the heat wins.  


  JR Gentry and Larry Bellman started the Malcuit Tavern Super Late Model feature on the front row, but the field didn't get a lap in before Brad Malcuit and Bellman tangled in turn three, with Malcuit having to be lifted off the nose of Bellman's car. Both drivers got their spots back with no laps completed. Gentry grabbed the lead as the green flag waved with Mike Bores pulling into second. Mitch Caskey took third on lap three and second on lap seven on the restart after a caution for Phil Wade. Gentry and Caskey, the fast qualifier, pulled away from the rest of the field with Caskey using different grooves to try and wrestle the lead away from Gentry.  


  At the end of lap 12, Caskey pulled to the infield with mechanical issues and Gentry's lead was more than a straightaway advantage over Bores. Malcuit and Ryan Markham dueled for third place during this time. Working lap 20, Gentry flew off turn two and into the outside retaining tires thanks to a broken ball joint, stopping his chance at the win.  


  Bores inherited the top spot as Markham was second ahead of Malcuit. Staying on Bores rear bumper, Markham used the high groove in turn two with three circuits to go and powered past Bores for the lead and into victory lane for the first time this season at WCS. Malcuit finished third as Shane McLoughlin and Bellman rounded out the top five. Malcuit and Gentry took the heat wins as Damon Haught won the Kar Connection/Accu Force Shocks hard charger award.  


  Mansfield's Kyle Moore used the pole position of the McKenzie Concrete Super Stock main and led all the way, but several drivers didn't make it easy for him. Chase Alexander started alongside Moore and stayed with him until the drive shaft dropped from his car on lap 11, bringing out the caution.  


  On the double-file restart, Jordan James lined up beside Moore with points leader Tyler Wiles right behind. Wiles' chance at winning came to a close when a flat tire on the next lap sent him to the pits to get a new one.  


  On the final restart, John Wilson had a chance at Moore on the final two laps, but could not get by him. Seth Dickerson passed James with two laps to go to claim third with Brandon Craver taking fifth. Moore posted his third Super Stock win after setting fast time, with Alexander and Wilson notching the heat wins.  


  Moore came right back out for the Kepling Flooring Modified feature. From his third starting position, he took the lead from Colton Shaw on the second lap and led all the way, but not without some anxious moments. After a caution at the halfway mark for a spun Larry Jarret, Kasey Bereft -- who was a late arrival and started last -- was up to second and right on Moore's rear end.  


  With both drivers racing up against the guardrail in turns one and two, Moore bounced off of it in turn two, but Bereft couldn't take advantage of the miscue and settled for second. Shaw finished third with Denny Benjamin and Robbie Ledger filling out the top five. Moore set fast time and won his heat along with his fifth Modified win at "Orrville's Historic Oval," giving him eight wins total. Shaw won the other heat race.  


  For the JoyRide Transport Mini Stocks feature, it was a beat-and-bang type of race for every position during the 12-lap event. Doug Hensel set the pace early on with Cory Staley in second. Johnny Bruce Sr., Jordan James, Jolene Voshel and Ryan Carder all competed for third. Staley received some damage on lap four and it affected his finish, as Bruce and James put pressure on Hensel for the lead. With three laps remaining, James took second, pulling alongside Hensel.  


  He later took the lead coming out of turn four as the white flag waved. Carder moved past Bruce for third and as the checkered flew for James, Hensel and Carder made contact with each other and both crossed the finish line sideways, finishing second and third. Bruce took fourth followed by Voshel. It was James' fourth straight win at WCS. Heat winners were Staley, James and Voshel, with Bobby Searls pocketing the last chance race.  


  Along with winning the features, Jacobs won a drum of methanol from Santmyer Energy, and both Markham and Moore won a drum of race gas thanks to Sunoco Race Fuels.  


  Racing action continues Saturday, Aug. 22 with the OVSCA Sprints returning for their third visit to WCS. The Malcuit Tavern Super Late Models, the McKenzie Concrete Super Stocks and the JoyRide Transport Mini Stocks will be back, plus more Kids bike races will be held. Gates open at 3 p.m. and racing at 7 p.m.

I really don't understand. America and China have been working together in business for at least a couple of decades that I'm aware of and then suddenly something changed? What exactly? China has been stealing American IP, but that isn't anything new. It almost seems a fair trade for cheap Chinese labor. Now POTUS is surprised and hurt that a company in China has been stealing personal data from us. Big deal… I don't think so. It seems more like a dick-measuring contest. So now we're headed to India for cheap labor and then five years from now, we'll likely have a problem with India over some minor incident. Yeah, the CCP is said to be evil but they're also hurting their own citizens as much as anyone in America. It's good Apple is using various countries for production and assembly.

CASCADE COUNTY - It’s been a frustrating weekend for some Great Falls homeowners, after finding crude graffiti on their fences, garage doors and cars. Vandalism is unfortunately nothing new for parts of town, but as they hit homes more often, some say the suspects may be getting bolder this time around.


  Since Thursday, locals near Great Falls High woke up to curse words, racial slurs, and what seems to be President Donald Trump’s name spray-painted overnight in their backyards.


  While they didn’t want to be on camera, the victims say they’ve seen new markings in a matter of days, even after spending hours cleaning up with chemicals and risking damage to existing paint.

Pellett estimated that his company’s portion of the job would’ve cost around $3,500 with Mid Valley Gravel providing about $2,700 of that through an in- kind donation. Republic Services contribution toward the project included a $3,000 Neighborhood Improvement Grant.
 As the house’s walls started to come down, Pellett paused his work while a few others pulled down some old newspapers that had apparently been used as insulation. They dated back to 1946, just a year before Cochran was born.
 A short time later, Pellett again stopped the demolition so the home’s front door could be removed. Fritz said she planned to take it home to be made into a table.
