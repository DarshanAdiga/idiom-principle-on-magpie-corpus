Denny Hamlin edged Dale Earnhardt Jr. in a door-banging final push to the checkered flag in Sunday’s eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series debut event, the Dixie Vodka 150, at iRacing’s virtual Homestead-Miami Speedway. Hamlin, who also won the NASCAR Cup Series season-opening Daytona 500, admitted Sunday’s iRacing event was certainly a different experience. He noted that he received a shaken Coca-Cola from his at-home pit crew (young daughter) during a caution period and actually competed barefoot. “I like feeling the pedals, with shoes I just can’t do it, so I always go barefoot,” Hamlin said with a laugh. Ultimately, he certainly provided a thrilling last- lap pass indicative of NASCAR’s best brand of tight racing – real or virtual. Shoes or not. “I just ran my line, he gave me the proper space and we were able to race to the line,’’ Hamlin said, noting that he had an advantage of newer tires. Earnhardt also noted the tight finish. “I’ve raced him on here [iRacing] for two decades, I thought he’d be hard to beat,’’ Earnhardt said. “I was trying to get a good finish, trying to win the race and trying not to wreck anybody. So I think I probably gave Denny a little more room than I really wanted to, but I had to keep from crashing him or anybody else. We got together off of [Turn] 4. I thought I might have been able to get a photo finish at the line, but we got together in [Turn] 4 and I about wrecked there. “But it was a fun race. Denny had better tires and he was just really, really fast, but it was a good race.’’ Timmy Hill, Chase Briscoe and pole-winner Garrett Smithley rounded out the top five in an event that had nine caution periods and certainly tested the iRacing skills of NASCAR’s top names. The 100-lap virtual race had all the crowd-pleasing, competitive elements to provide an afternoon escape from the worries about the COVID-19 virus that has paused all live action in the sports world. Hamlin pledged prior to the race to donate $100 per lap led plus $5,000 for winning the race – for a total of $6,400 this afternoon – to The NASCAR Foundation to assist Miami-area families affected by the virus, while others matched and added on to his donation. Both longtime race fans and - judging by social media - lots of new eyeballs checked out the FS1 broadcast called by FOX Sports’ regulars, Mike Joy, Jeff Gordon and Larry McReynolds. And the race included a broad spectrum of NASCAR regulars representing all three national series – from the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series. The list of competitors included highly accomplished drivers like past NASCAR Cup Series champions Jimmie Johnson, Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano along with NASCAR Hall of Famer Bobby Labonte. Also racing were the sport’s decades-long Most Popular Driver Earnhardt and Chase Elliott, who assumed that crown when Earnhardt retired from fulltime competition two years ago. And all these longtime NASCAR champs were dutifully challenged by a group of competitors with lots of iRacing experience such as Hill and Smithley. The virtual race provided all the exciting, lap-by-lap intrigue as what fans would have seen in a regular points race. Hamlin, who drove a replica of his No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota in the NASCAR Cup Series, was among the pre-race favorites, along with Smithley and Hill, who has accumulated 673 iRacing wins but his best NASCAR Cup Series finish is 14th. Smithley’s best NASCAR Cup Seires finish is 28th. While Hamlin’s iRacing set-up cost nearly $40,000 (by his own estimate) and featured all the modern accoutrements, Hill was racing on a basic steering wheel he attached to a desk at home. It all shows how this form of competition evens the playing field, making it more about experience than equipment. “Wow what a day!,’’ Smithley said on Twitter following the race. “Pole, led laps, came home 5th. Awesome race! Really good way for all of us to have some fun.’’ Hill was equally as energized by the afternoon and his showing. “DANG! Should’ve put tires on there at the end!,’’ he said on Twitter. “Fun race all around!” Rounding out the top 10 were Cup Series regulars Alex Bowman, Bubba Wallace and Ryan Preece. Gander Trucks driver Ty Majeski - who led all 20 laps in winning the qualifying race to advance to Sunday’s 100-lapper - finished ninth. And Hamlin’s JGR Cup Series teammate Erik Jones was 10th. William Byron, a pre-race favorite who started on the outside pole position, led laps early but was collected in an accident late in the race. He finished 34th. His Hendrick Motorsports teammate, seven-time champ Johnson, finished 31st after also being involved in a couple incidents. Johnson smilingly said of his racing experience on Sunday, “It’s quite different to say the least.’’ Following the race, Johnson posted on social media. “Awesome to see our industry come together for the #ProInvitationalSeries today. Appreciate all the fans who tuned in and everyone who made this possible.’’ That was certainly the overall feeling from the drivers who participated. “It’s always fun when you win, but regardless, I mean, it’s just – it was a great event,’’ Hamlin said. “For the community, the racing community, the NASCAR drivers to come together and put 20-something drivers on the racetrack with such short notice, everyone is buying up simulation rigs this week and last week getting ready for the event, and for it all to come together and have a great finish, I think it was definitely a success.’’ And, Hamlin added, “If we got five new fans that were just sitting at home watching TV today that thought it was exciting and is willing to tune in next week or willing to tune into a NASCAR race or go to a NASCAR race because they got introduced to racing today by iRacing, it’s a success. “There’s no number that makes it a success. If you made positive gains in your audience, whether it be one person or 1,000, it’s a good thing.’’

Dalton Gerlach opened Lodge Room in 2017, just as Highland Park was becoming the heart of the city’s live indie music scene. The 30-year-old’s family (along with three investors) co-owns the stately Masonic building that houses it, which helps for staying in business if there is a long closure. But there is a mortgage to pay, and while “lenders aren’t too friendly in such situations, this is unprecedented, and I hope we can defer things,” he said.
 Gerlach said he feels the deep disappointment of sending his staff home until this blows over.
 “We put some reserves aside, but we never thought we’d have to use them for this,” he said, adding that he estimated the club could hang on for four to five months in standby mode. “We’re optimistic we can stay around, but we had to do hard things like cut all hourly staff. Everyone’s kicking in to take reduced pay. Survival in this business is week to week and month to month even in good times. This is obviously much more dramatic.”
 Gerlach has been working from home in Franklin Village with his girlfriend and managing the few things left while the club goes dark — giving out all the unsold food to employees and dealing with vendor contracts for the rest of the year. He fears what the social isolation will do for the morale of his employees.
 “It’s strange, people don’t realize how much this means to us. Sometimes it feels like work is work, but when you don’t have it, it’s like losing a family.”
 Raghav Desai, Lodge Room’s talent buyer, has been holed up with his dog in his Glendale apartment. “He’s a companion I never thought I’d need until now,” the 27-year-old joked. “He keeps me sane and allows me to escape the reality of the situation.”
 That reality is an empty calendar and no prospect of booking shows until summer at the earliest. “South by Southwest canceling was a huge reality check,” he said. “A week later, it was Coachella, and that was like ‘Oh, OK. This is going to affect us.’ Then the government made their recommendations and it all unraveled. It’s been really weird. How does a venue exist when people aren’t allowed to go to concerts?”
 Desai has been emailing artists and agents to try and hold dates for later in the year and figuring out how to refund fans who bought tickets in advance (he hopes that most will hang onto tickets for reschedulings). But as the point of contact for the artists who pass through Lodge Room, he’s more nervous about how they’ll hold on.
 “I’m worried about the bands,” he said. “So many livelihoods are affected by this: tour managers, audio engineers, bartenders. What’s going to happen to them?”

HAMMONDVILLE -- One year ago, DeKalb resident Kim Payne was involved in a car wreck on her way home. On March 17, 2019, her vehicle veered off the road, impacting with a tree head-on and igniting in flames shortly after.
   
 Payne's sister-in-law, Abbie Pritchett, recalls the moment her nephew came running in the house after witnessing the crash.
   
 "He was hollering that his mom had been in a wreck, and by the time I got there, she was already out of the vehicle on the back of Craig's vehicle," said Pritchett.
   
 Craig Hall serves as Hammondville's fire chief and was recognized for his act of heroism by Susan Akes, mayor of Hammondville, last October.
   
 Hall said he was working in the shop when the page came through.
   
 "When I got there, the outside door wouldn't open. I reached my hand in to open the door, and at this time, the right front side was already burning," he said.
   
 Hall was able to pull Payne from her vehicle without her sustaining any burns.
   
 He said the tires then started popping. The vehicle was already hot and "another five minutes and it wouldn't have been good at all," said Hall.
   
 Hammondville, Blake and Fort Payne Fire Departments responded to the scene.
   
 Pritchett said Payne was unconscious and had three open areas on her right leg where the bone had come through, including multiple cuts and lacerations.
   
 Payne was transferred to DeKalb Regional Medical Center for a quick assessment before being airlifted to Huntsville Hospital.
   
 "She had multiple seizures on the way to Huntsville and after a quick assessment, they had to do surgery to relieve pressure on one side of her brain. It was not looking good," said Pritchett.
   
 Among her injuries, Payne has suffered a traumatic brain injury, crushed pelvis, broken leg, strokes and a bruised lung.
   
 "Three weeks in, she got what is called an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and very few people recover from that," said Pritchett.
   
 Payne was placed in a RotoProne bed. According to ardsglobal.org, the bed facilitates easing the patient onto their stomach and also swings the patient into a 120-degree arc to help move accumulated fluid in the lungs.
   
 Pritchett said before they could operate on Payne's leg, they had to wait for the swelling to decrease. "She has a rod from her hip to her knee," she said.
   
 The family was eventually told Payne wasn't going to make it, and if she lived, she would have to live in a facility that would allow her to be on a ventilator because she would have to have help breathing for the rest of her life and would require to be on a feeding tube.
   
 "They said she would be paralyzed completely on the entire right side of her body and would be blind on that side. Long story short, she would never come home and eat dinner with her family ever again," said Pritchett.
   
 Two weeks later, the family was called in to decide Payne's future.
   
 "We had had multiple prayers, but at that point, we just all started praying. People were starting to reach out from other states like Tennessee and California," Pritchett said.
   
 She said a coworker had family praying in Mexico, and there were also people praying in India and a coworker's parents who visited Jerusalem placed Kim's name on the Wester Wall also known as the "wall of prayer."
   
 "But after all that happened, Kim started moving her right hand and then she opened her eyes and smiled for the first time," said Pritchett.
   
 During Payne's stay in Huntsville, she was regularly visited by Rev. Taylor Gallman of Asbury United Methodist Church.
   
 "He probably came three or four times a week and was there. We really enjoyed his presence. He prayed with us and brought us food, and if we didn't want to talk, he sat with us and we just really thought that was special," Pritchett said.
   
 Around mid April, Payne was transferred to Kindred Health and Rehab in Chattanooga, Tennessee. and by the first week of May, she began weaning off the ventilator.
   
 On May 15, Payne reached a new milestone; she said her first words since the accident.
   
 "She looked at her mama and said she loved her," Pritchett said.
   
 Sooner after, Payne was accepted into Shepherds Rehab in Atlanta. She began doing physical, occupation and speech therapy an hour a day.
   
 "By May 19, Kim started to put together sentences for the first time. They wouldn't always make sense but she was able to say some things," said Pritchett.
   
 As her progress continued, she was able to stand for the first time since her accident. She fed herself and was able to use the bathroom by herself by the end of that month.
   
 Although she still had her feeding tube, she was eating three meals a day, and by June 4, her trach was removed.
   
 On June 18, family and friends waited for Payne's arrival home with decorative signs and balloons as they lined the side of the road.
   
 "When Kim came home, she was able to get out of the car and walk in the house with a walker," Pritchett said.
   
 Once at home, Payne was seen by Home Health with Amedisys, who worked with her for eight weeks.
   
 Currently, Payne is on a break from therapy but said she is still doing home therapy on her own.
   
 Pritchett credits Kathy Pritchett, Payne's mother, with caring for her throughout her battle and recovery.
   
 "Kathy has been with her since the accident and stayed with her from March 17 until she came home on July 18 and has solely taken care of her by herself since then," she said.
   
 Payne's brother Zack Pritchett, has been a constant supporter of her journey, staying by her side as much as he could while she was hospitalized and visiting every other weekend when she was in Atlanta.
   
 He said the family wanted to thank everyone for all the prayers and support.
   
 "I really think the prayers are the only reason she is still here," said Zack Pritchett.
   
 He said Payne has been making steady improvements, and they are proud of her.
   
 The family said they would like to convey the message that although Payne was "pretty much gone," it is through prayers, faith and god that she's alive.
   
 "She is a miracle, and God is real," Abbie Prichett said.
   
 She said Payne is taking the time to finish healing and the process could take a few years. It can take up to three years to heal from a brain injury and return to the capacity that you were at before the injury.
   
 "We believe God still has a plan for Kim and her work is not done," she said.
   
 Payne expressed her thanks for everybody's support and prayers through her battle.
   
 "That's the only reason I am still here," she said.
   
 Regarding her leg injuries Payne continues to make progress.
   
 "Sometimes it's hard for me to bend but it seems to be a lot better than what it was," said Payne.
   
 She said before she couldn't even get up or stand up however the right side of her body gives her some difficulty.
   
 Kathy Pritchett said since Payne has come home from therapy, she and her whole family have been attending church at Asbury almost every Sunday.
   
 As Payne continues to recover, her family celebrates every milestone she accomplishes, providing support and encouragement along the way.
   
 "God has a plan for her and she's going to do something great," said Abbie Pritchett.

WASHINGTON — Top-level negotiations between Congress and White House teetered Sunday over a nearly $1.4 trillion economic rescue package, as the coronavirus crisis deepened, the nation shut down and the first U.S. senator tested positive for the disease.
 As President Donald Trump took to the podium in the White House briefing room and promised to help Americans who feel afraid and isolated as the pandemic spreads, the Senate was turning back the aid package on a procedural vote. But negotiations continued on Capitol Hill.
 “We're enduring a great national trial and we will prove that we can meet the moment," Trump said. “We're at war.”
 At the otherwise emptied out Capitol, the draft aid bill was declared insufficient by Democrats, who argued it was tilted toward corporations rather than workers and healthcare providers. The setback sent Republicans back to the negotiating table.
 With a population on edge and shell-shocked financial markets poised for the new work week, all sides were hoping for an agreement that would provide some relief against health and economic crises that are likely to stretch for several months.
 “Americans don't need to see us haggling endlessly,” warned Senate Majority Leader McConnell, R-Ky., his voice rising on the Senate floor. He sought passage of the package by Monday.
 But Democrats say the largely GOP-led effort does not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and fails to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion “slush fund” for corporations.
 Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the draft package “significantly cut back our hospitals, our cities, our states, our medical workers and so many others needed in this crisis.”
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., invoked Pope Francis in urging colleagues to “take responsibility” as Democrats prepared their own draft.
 While the congressional leaders worked to send help, alarms were being sounded from coast to coast about the wave of coronavirus cases about to crash onto the nation's health system.
 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had dire, urgent news from the pandemic’s U.S. epicenter: “April and May are going to be a lot worse,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
 De Blasio all but begged Washington to help procure ventilators and other medical supplies. He accused the president of “not lifting a finger” to help.
 “If the president doesn’t act, people will die who could have lived otherwise,” he said.
 Trump urged Congress to get a deal done and, during the Sunday briefing, responded to criticism that his administration was sluggish to respond. He cited his cooperation with the three states hardest hit — New York, Washington and California — and invoked a measure to give governors flexibility in calling up the national guard under their control, while the federal government covers the bill.
 But even as Trump stressed federal-local partnerships, some governors, including Republican Greg Abbott of Texas, expressed unhappiness with Washington's response. The president himself took a swipe hours earlier at Gov. J. B. Pritzker, D-Ill., saying that he and “a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News" should not be “blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings."
 This came as the first senator, Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky, announced he tested positive for the coronavirus. Paul, who is a doctor and close ally of the president, said in a tweet he was not showing symptoms and was in quarantine.
 Paul was seen at a GOP senators' lunch on Friday and swimming in the Senate gym pool on Sunday morning. His office said he left the Senate immediately after learning his diagnosis.
 A growing list of lawmakers have cycled in and out of isolation after exposure, and two members of the House have said they tested positive. Five senators were in self-quarantine Sunday evening.

While business-investor tax cuts will almost certainly be the official government response, few of the above measures for working class Americans are likely to materialize. In the US, working class folks always get the short end of the economic stick. Congress has passed trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the top one percent, but raised taxes on the working class. Companies with billions of dollars in annual profits pay nothing in taxes, and actually get a subsidy check from the government to boot. Just ask Amazon, IBM, innumerable financial institutions, pharmaceutical companies and more.

After the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, was canceled and then Indio’s Coachella festival was postponed, it was obvious that the live music business would be deeply affected by COVID-19. This month, mega- promoters Live Nation and AEG hit pause on all its tours and festivals, but with deep coffers and expensive insurance policies, they will likely weather the storm.
 But for the small-capacity, independent nightclubs that form the backbone of L.A.’s local music scene, the coronavirus is an unprecedented nightmare.
 “The venues controlled by AEG and Live Nation will be fine. But smaller independent venues are going to be under strain,” said Patrick Adler, a researcher at the University of Toronto and a PhD candidate at UCLA who studies music festivals and the live-music economy. “Most smaller places don’t have one month of rent on hand, so two months will destroy them.”

Skyline Superintendent Becca Flowers told district board of education members at their monthly meeting March 9 that she continues to monitor the coronavirus situation closely. The district receives updates from the Pratt County Health Department which gets updates from the Kansas Department of Health and Education that gets updates from the Center for Disease Control.
   
 "The risk in Kansas is low at this time but the school continues to take precautions to keep students safe from COVID-19 and from the flu," Flowers said.
   
 Staff uses disinfects throughout the school and students are reminded to wash their hands and cover coughs. If there are developments that impact the school, Flowers said they will notify faculty, staff, students, parents and the Board members.
   
 "Just know, we're watching that very close," Flowers said.
   
 Getting students ready to continue their education or go into the work force is Skyline's goal for all students. Flowers presented an update on Individual Plans of Study for students to the USD 438 BOE.
   
 Each student is required to have an IPS that establishes which courses they need to take to meet their career goals for graduation. This is a digital portfolio and has to be continuously updated. Part of the IPS includes documenting a students involvement in school and community activities.
   
 Each student is assigned to a teacher who acts as a career advisor. Once a month, the student meets with the teacher to make sure the student is sticking to the IPS and taking the courses necessary to meet their career goals.
   
 It takes time to develop each IPS but once they are in place, they compliment every thing else they do at Skyline, Flowers said.
   
 At least once a year, parents should also take part in a meeting so they know what is expected of their student. The IPS is a guideline but it's very flexible to fit each individual students career goals.
   
 The IPS is one of the five outcomes outlined by the Kansas State Board of Education. The five goals are individual student IPS, kindergarten readiness, social and emotional development, high school graduation success and post secondary success rates.
   
 The Kansas Legislature has paired two bills impacting education. HB 2465 expands tax credit eligibility for students to go to private school. This bill takes money from public education Flowers said public eduction does not favor that bill.
   
 "We don't want the tax credit bill to fly," Flowers said.
   
 In an effort to get it to pass, a second bill, HB 2526, has been added and is designed to change the finance formula for schools doing big projects. While the second bill won't help Skyline, it will benefit other school districts.
   
 Food Service Director Maria Briggs has been getting rave reviews from Skyline students for her innovate menu changes. A student advisory committee has been making suggestions and Briggs is making them a reality.
   
 One recent success was serving breakfast at lunch time. The students really really liked it and want to have it again. Briggs is also serving more from scratch items that is a big hit with the students and teachers.
   
 "I hear tons of positive things out of our kids for her," Flowers said. "She's doing some awesome stuff."
   
 In other action, the board approved the following contracts: Lee Kendall- baseball assistant coach, Zeke McPherson-baseball head coach, Chris Sanders- softball assistant coach, Lori Anschutz-softball head coach, Andrew Nation- middle school and high school head track coach, Chris Sanders-middle school track assistant coach, Lori Anschutz-middle school track assistant coach, Kenny Eddy-high school track assistant coach, Bob Lee-high school track assistant coach.

 LAUSANA, Suiza (AP) — El Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) tendrá hasta cuatro semanas para decidir si pospone los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio en medio de crecientes críticas por la manera en que hace frente a la pandemia del coronavirus y el domingo se sumó un llamado del líder de la federación de atletismo, el deporte más importante en la justa mundial.
 El COI planea reunirse con las autoridades de Japón, funcionarios del deporte internacional, medios con derechos de transmisión y patrocinadores para abordar la planeación de un escenario para los Juegos Olímpicos, previstos para realizarse del 24 de julio al 9 de agosto, indicó el COI. La cancelación de los Juegos no está bajo consideración.
 El presidente del COI, Thomas Bach, envió una carta a los deportistas en la cual explica la decisión y el motivo por el que tomaría tanto tiempo tomarla, al tiempo que reconoció que ese largo periodo de cuatro semanas podría no ser del agrado de todos.
 “Comprendo que esta situación sin precedentes no responde muchas de sus preguntas”, escribió. “También sé que este enfoque racional quizá no se ajuste a las emociones por las que muchos de ustedes están pasando”.
 Pero apenas horas después del anuncio, el presidente de World Athletics _órgano rector del atletismo a nivel mundial_, Sebastian Coe, mandó una misiva a Bach en la que señaló que realizar los Juegos Olímpicos en julio “no es ni factible ni deseable”. Coe subrayó varios motivos, incluyendo la imparcialidad competitiva, la probabilidad de que los deportistas entrenen de más ante un calendario de competencia reducido y la incertidumbre causada por las órdenes de muchos gobiernos de cerrar gimnasios y otras instalaciones para ejercitarse.
 “Nadie desea que los Juegos Olímpicos sean pospuestos, pero... no podemos llevar a cabo el evento a toda costa, seguramente no a costa de la seguridad de los deportistas”, sostuvo. “Una decisión respecto a los Juegos Olímpicos podría resultar muy obvia en poco tiempo”.
 Sin embargo, tal decisión no podría tomarse en menos de un mes.
 El COI detalló que los escenarios que están siendo considerados “se relacionan con la modificación de planes operacionales existentes para que los Juegos empiecen el 24 de julio de 2020 y también para cambios a la fecha de inicio de los Juegos”.
 El cambio de estrategia se da luego que Bach sostuvo una conferencia telefónica con integrantes de la mesa directiva.
 Bach ha dicho constantemente que los organizadores están comprometidos de lleno a iniciar la justa el 24 de julio _a pesar de que los entrenamientos de los deportistas, eventos de clasificación y la preparación de los Juegos en Tokio son afectados cada vez más por el brote del nuevo coronavirus.
 Las críticas sobre esta postura han aumentado en los últimos días por parte de medallistas de oro olímpicos y por un integrante del COI el pasado martes, antes que Bach finalmente reconociera que es posible un plan alterno.
 Los comités olímpicos de Brasil y Eslovenia posteriormente pidieron que los Juegos Olímpicos fueran pospuestos hasta 2021. El organismo que rige el deporte olímpico de Noruega señaló que no quería que los atletas acudan a Tokio hasta que la crisis sanitaria global esté bajo control.
 Las federaciones estadounidenses de atletismo y natación _dos de los tres deportes más importantes de los Juegos Olímpicos_ exhortaron al Comité Olímpico de Estados Unidos a solicitar el aplazamiento de las competencias.
 “Hay un incremento drástico de casos y nuevos brotes de la enfermedad COVID-19 en distintos países de todos los continentes”, aseveró el COI. “Esto llevó a (la junta) a la conclusión de que el COI necesita tomar el siguiente paso en la planeación de un escenario alterno”.
 El COI informó la semana pasada que alrededor de 4.700 de los 11.000 lugares disponibles en los Juegos Olímpicos aun deben ser otorgados por medio de eventos clasificatorios.
 Bach reconoció que un calendario reducido o radicalmente alterado para esos eventos podría generar problemas, pero también planteó varias razones por las que el COI no debería apresurarse a tomar una decisión.
 Entre los motivos subrayó la disponibilidad de las sedes que están programadas para ser usadas a mediados de este año pero que no podrían estar disponibles en fechas posteriores y la alteración de competencias futuras de distintos deportes.
 “El tomar hoy una decisión sobre una postergación no podría determinar una nueva fecha para los Juegos Olímpicos ante la incertidumbre de los sucesos en ambas direcciones: una mejora, como lo estamos viendo en varios países gracias a las severas medidas que se están tomando, o una situación de deterioro en otros países”, dijo Bach.
 “Las vidas humanas tienen prioridad sobre todas las cosas, incluida la realización de los juegos”, escribió Bach. “El COI quiere ser parte de la solución”.
 Cualquier aplazamiento de los Juegos Olímpicos repercutiría en los Paralímpicos que estaban programados para llevarse a cabo del 25 de agosto al 6 de septiembre, igual en Tokio.
 Por su parte, el Comité Paralímpico Internacional (CPI) declaró que “como pueden imaginar, el potencial cambio de fecha de los Juegos Olímpicos y Paralímpicos es un enorme desafío logístico y el CPI apoyará al COI en cada momento”.
 “Actualmente es de suma importancia que todos, incluidos los atletas, se queden en casa para ayudar a frenar la propagación de esta terrible enfermedad que está impactando a la comunidad internacional”, añadió el CPI, con sede en Alemania.

Many of us are in isolation or have severely curtailed our activities, unnerved by the spread of a deadly virus but fortunate to have family members, a fully stocked cupboard, and books and streaming services to occupy our minds. As we protect ourselves and our loved ones, we also must ensure that our region's homeless residents receive the care they need to withstand this public health crisis.
   
 Homeless shelters, service providers and employees of the city of Eugene and Lane County have all rallied to help in recent weeks. They've received special training and are working to educate homeless residents wherever they live. They've installed dozens of hand-sanitizing stations throughout the area, a vital step to deterring spread of the virus among the homeless and the broader community. They've extended shelter hours, an important move because some chilly nights lie ahead even as springtime weather approaches. And they've hired a company to provide non-emergency transportation to those who need it.
   
 St. Vincent de Paul's overnight shelter program, Dusk to Dawn, is now open around the clock. The Eugene Mission has created new sleeping quarters for those who appear sick, and medical volunteers with CAHOOTS are helping to screen clients at the Egan Warming Center's newly consolidated location at the Lane Events Center at the Lane County Fairgrounds.
      
 These efforts - and many others - are but the latest examples of the tireless dedication of people who help the homeless day in and day out. Their resources will be severely strained in the weeks ahead if coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads rapidly among the homeless and if more people lose their jobs and must turn to charitable services for assistance. More than half of American adults say they live paycheck to paycheck.
   
 Those charitable services typically operate on shoestring budgets and rely on generous gifts of time and labor from supporters. Volunteers are at the heart of these organizations, and many of them are retirees who fall into the age group most vulnerable to complications from the virus. Charitable groups will need to take every precaution possible to protect older volunteers from infection, including sending the most-susceptible home if necessary.
   
 In the meantime, all of us should look for ways that we can help sustain the availability of services for homeless residents who remain in our community. Those of us who are privileged with good health and financial security need to dig deeper to donate to organizations like the Eugene Mission and CAHOOTS. Our help is always needed but all the more so now.
   
 Sheryl Balthrop, the Mission's executive director, stresses that the stakes are high. "We are providing the bulk of needs to some of the most impoverished individuals in our community," she says, "and if the rest of the community becomes fearful and stops providing for that need, I think that the overall health of this population will further suffer, separate and entirely apart from the coronavirus. When it passes, we'll have a group of individuals that have been hurt just by the fear factor."
   
 Curbing the spread of the virus among the homeless will help reduce its spread among the general population, too.
   
 Government officials in Eugene and Lane County must continually reassess their responses and look for additional ways to assist. Washington's King County has installed modular units to house homeless residents who've been infected with COVID-19, for example. The city of Salem has partially repealed its camping ban, a move that will enable homeless individuals to self-isolate within a tent. Other communities are opening up large public spaces to isolate homeless individuals who fall ill.
   
 Together, we can endure this crisis. But together, we must look out for the most vulnerable among us and ensure they are not left alone in a great time of need.

However, living in California, America's main wine growing state, he didn't like American wine.
 "I didn't think I liked wine when I was a younger man, because I didn't like the American stuff," he says. "It is more often too heavy, too sweet, too alcoholic.
 "Then I went to Europe for the first time when I was 28, and tried French wine for the first time. And it was a huge revelation.
 "French wine is far more elegant, far more mineral, far more traditionally made. It is night and day.
 "Then in 2012 we [my wife and I] moved to Paris for a year, just to take a hiatus, and I started looking more intensely at doing something in wine in France. We went to Burgundy, and I was like 'this is it, this is ground zero, this is the benchmark'. I fell hard for Burgundy wines."
 Home to some of the most expensive, and highly-prized wines in the world, Burgundy predominately produces white wines made from chardonnay grapes, and reds made from pinot noir. The wineries and vineyards are often very small, with some producers owning just a few rows or plots of vines here and there.

 I break it down like this:
 • Am I a better wife this year than last?
 • Am I a better mother, overall, and to each of our children?
 • Am I a better grandmother?
 • Am I a better worker?
 • Am I a better writer?

In effort to help reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, Thunderhill Raceway announced that it will shut down all public access through April 2. Additionally, the track officials said that it cannot say with any degree of credibility that the track will be open on any given weekend in April. Given this uncertainty, and the updates and closings brought on by the COVID-19 virus, the Trans Am Series presented by Pirelli West Coast Championship race weekend at Thunderhil Raceway April 3-5 has been postponed with the goal of rescheduling in late summer or fall. “We have been trying our best to do the right thing but it appears that we cannot survive business as usual in this environment,” said David Vodden, Thunderhill President and CEO. “We will allow private events where no flaggers are needed and no food service is offered beyond pre-prepared box lunches for no more than the stated 25 number, “ noted Vodden. “We encourage our private test day visitors to not go into town, not to stay over-night and, generally, come in the morning and leave for home in the evening absent any footprint beyond the track.” Trans Am Series Management and Ownership are continuing to monitor the situation and will provide updates accordingly. The next scheduled event for both the National and West Coast Championships is set for May 1-3 at WeatherTech Laguna Seca.

Maybe some provinces honestly thought - and certainly hoped - that this strange new world we're living in would only be around for a few weeks. It's not.
 More and more health officials are telling us to brace for a prolonged closure of public life, one that could last months as we wait for a vaccine and verified treatment.
 As this begins to settle in for Canadians, the idea may produce stress and anxiety. This has never happened before in modern day Canada, not on this scale. Our lives have been upended.
 Meanwhile, Canada does not yet have the total lockdowns experienced in countries such as Italy and France.
 While we wish the current measures were enough, we suspect there is more to go. Canadians should brace themselves for even more disruption.
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said over the weekend that the $82 billion financial package he announced last week was just "a very first step" to help workers and businesses who have seen their activities grind to a halt.
 It's enough to make any normal person bury their head in the sand and pray that it all just goes away.
 We can't bury our heads though. We all have an obligation to be courageous and confront this head on. There is a reason we are doing this, a reason we are following such life changing social distancing measures. It's because we care about other people in our society.
 While many of us will likely get COVID-19 and experience little more than flu- like symptoms, many could also be seriously ill and even die from it. That's especially true for the elderly and anyone with compromised immune systems.
 We're doing this collectively because the human race is, at its core, a compassionate one. That's why it's vital we follow these measures.
