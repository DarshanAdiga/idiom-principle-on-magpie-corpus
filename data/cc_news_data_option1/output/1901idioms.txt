As cities and suburbs expanded in the 19th and 20th centuries, so did power stations, water treatment plants and waste facilities. Increasingly, these structures were built on the industrial fringes of metropolitan areas, out of sight and out of mind. Often they were located in underserved communities that lacked the political clout to object.

Bollywood stars never shy away from experimenting with fashion. These divas have always been extremely fond of keeping their fashion game on point. Be it a reception, festive occasions, red carpets, lunch dates or a promotional event, actresses always turn up in their stylish best. The actresses never shy away from experimenting and always ace their fashion game. From floral sarees, absolutely gorgeous embellished lehengas and mirrored red carpet gowns, they define fashion as glam and comfort. They also keep experimenting with their hair colours, lip shades and multiple makeup hacks which they carry off with style. One of the trends that had taken the industry by storm was a redhead look. Many of our favourite divas tried the look and set a fashion goal. “Whatever Bollywood does, fans follow it. Red hair is back in fashion again. It’s sexier, romantic and goes well with the Indian skin tone. Red gives a very rockstar vibe. Earlier, the red highlight was popular but now it’s the ombré technique (darker hues at roots with gradually lightened ends) and balayage technique (derived from the French word that means “to sweep”, a natural transition to the lighter shade). These new trends are a hit,” says a celebrity Bollywood hairstylist. Today we have for you times when Bollywood divas slayed effortlessly in red hair looks!

"The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the- scenes with everyone else's highlight reel."   -Stephen Furtick
 Social distancing. We all know what that is now, right? Just four months ago, some might have thought it was the new way to dump your boyfriend. No more uncomfortable talks, or claims of, "It's not you, it's me." You just stop taking his calls, start going to different clubs and restaurants, and boom, done.
 Nope. If only it were that simple. Social distancing is a very generic, polite way of saying, "Get the heck away from me, you snoogering petri dish of peril." It's likely going to become the iconic phrase of 2020 -- and while staying at home, backing up a few feet in the grocery line and washing your hands so often they look like chicken talons, has become our standard now, what about another kind of distancing? Has anyone considered the impact social media distancing could have?
 When COVID-19 first started to ramp up, and restaurants, stores, pubs and schools were closed, where did many of us turn? To our digital world. To smartphones, to tweet out every bit of outrage, disappointment and fear. To Facebook, to post ridiculous junk science videos from YouTubers who can't spell but should be regarded as epidemiological experts. We researched malaria drugs to treat the virus because someone from our book group said it was real. We read "news" stories from sites that didn't have a single editor or journalist writing or fact-checking anything, and we ran with them, plastering links all over Reddit, Tumblr and anywhere else we could punch up on a keyboard. Then we blamed the media. Because that makes sense, right? It wasn't us! It was them!
 It's no secret that I am a huge screen addict. Whether it's my phone, my laptop or my hourly Google alerts, it's nearly constant with me, and it's definitely been a problem from time to time. Every so often I've had to pull the plug, and just not engage in any of it. Normally, when I've stepped away, it's made me twitchy because while I'd like to call it being informed and engaged with my world, it's really just that I'm nosier than everyone's odd Aunt Helen and tech-savvy enough to know how to snoop more efficiently than peering out my window with the lights off. Giving up my social media crack pipe was hard.
 Then along comes the C-word. No, not that one! Corona. COVID-19. The onslaught of information, misinformation, and, well, insanity, on social media became a curve no amount of isolation could flatten. Entire pages of the World Wide Web became all about mask-shaming, finger-pointing, and plain old tattling. We could instantly see that some lunatic was licking produce and posting a video of it as a "Corona challenge." We saw armed men and women literally take to the streets to square off against nurses, who, not for nothing, had to stop caring for patients to deal with tantrums over haircuts and shoe shopping. For me, the tipping point was when some half-wit was ranting that his right to a meal at Golden Corral was more important than his elderly neighbor's life, eloquently stating, "We're all going to die someday anyway. Why can't I have a nice meal?"
 That's when my internet intermittent fasting plan kicked in. No, it's not going to help me ditch the extra pounds or repair my bank balance, but it's done wonders for my stress level. It's hard to stay focused and rational when you're up to the wee small hours going down the rabbit hole of alt-whatever websites, shopping on Amazon and Googling yet another conspiracy theory. I set up hours where no social media was allowed. I locked my phone in my desk drawer during meals. The laptop was closed and put away at 9 p.m. every night. OK, well no, not every night. No one is perfect, and sure, I fell off the wagon a few times. I'm working on it. The times that I did disengage though? Those were the nights I slept better, the mornings I didn't wake up with a pessimistic view of nearly everything. I didn't have to look at everyone's new hobbies, nature walks, and expert homeschooling moments and feel like an utter failure. There was way less looking around my cluttered space and comparing it to the Pinterest-perfect pantries full of kale chips and alphabetized spice racks.
 Then, the unthinkable happened. I bought a puzzle. A jigsaw puzzle with 300 pieces. Amateur hour for some, but a talented local artist, Carol Eldridge, has created one with scenes of the harbor, sailboats and sunny days. It should be noted, much like people who are nearsighted or can't skip, I have almost zero ability to put together a puzzle that has more than five or six pieces. It might as well be rocket science for me. Yet that puzzle will be completed, probably this weekend. With G-d as my witness, those pieces will come together and make something suitable for framing. As we move toward opening up the outside world again, maybe we should also consider shutting down our online pursuits, or at least cutting back? That's my plan, at least until this puzzle is done. Stay tuned, be well, and when this mess is over, come by and see the finished product!

“The Daytrippers”: For whatever reason, I've found Parker Posey supremely reassuring during the pandemic. I just can't imagine her taking anything from anybody, or a global infectious disease. She's part of an ensemble in this 1996 comedy by Greg Motolla alongside Liev Schreiber, Anne Meara, Stanley Tucci and others. It's very much a '90s New York indie film, full of talk and deadpan humor, as a family navigates a Manhattan odyssey in a station wagon. A marathon of Posey movies ("Kicking and Screaming," “Best in Show") may be in order (Streaming on Criterion Channel).

Four years ago the Town initiated a lawsuit with the MBTA. The story behind this lawsuit is important for the JUN2020 Town election. In JUN2017 the MBTA (a public agency) and Eversource (a private corporation) entered into a lease agreement for the MBTA Right of Way (RoW) in Sudbury. This agreement allows Eversource to build and operate a high voltage transmission line on the RoW. Not only would this transmission line impede future public use of the property as a rail line (the protected purpose of the RoW), it also creates significant environmental damage in Sudbury's most sensitive areas (Memorial Forest, Hop Brook, Assabet River Preserve, etc). The lease agreement is precedent setting and, arguably, illegal. The burden to prove this private use of the publicly owned MBTA RoW is illegal rests with Sudbury.
 Select person Pat Brown, currently running for re-election, was not allowed to participate in relevant Executive or Public discussion on this topic from 2017 to 2019 because her home abuts the MBTA RoW. In 2018, when Dan Carty (another abutter) was elected he also was not allowed to participate. In 2019 Bill Schineller (another abutter) was elected and the Rule of Necessity was invoked. Normally Bill would not be allowed to participate in Eversource/MBTA decisions; however, as the 3rd selectman with an abutter's conflict on a 5-person Board, the BoS would no longer have a quorum to conduct this business. Under the Rule of Necessity, all Board members (regardless of their abutter status) may now participate to convene a quorum in matters related to Eversource and the MBTA RoW . In my opinion, Pat, Dan and Bill are three of our hardest working advocates protecting Sudbury's character and environment. If Pat were not re-elected, the Rule of Necessity would no longer apply. Bill and Dan could no longer participate in matters related to the Eversource proposal. It is commendable that we have new residents interested in serving on the Select Board. We must note, however, electing any non-abutter to the MBTA RoW invalidates the Rule of Necessity. The Town would lose its three strongest advocates in opposing and defeating Eversource, the MBTA and their problematic electric transmission line (a position repeatedly supported by Town Meeting). Sudbury needs Pat Brown. Vote via early or absentee ballot, or if unavoidable, in person 23JUN (while maintaining social distance).
 Re-elect Pat Brown to the Select Board!

LISBON -- Portugal's professional soccer league is due to restart on June 4 after the coronavirus stoppage but the question of which stadiums should host matches is threatening to become a bone of contention.
 The government's health directorate (DGS) has said in its medical guidelines that as few stadiums as possible should be used to complete the season, although it did not stipulate a number, and the Portuguese league began inspections on Thursday.
 It quickly became clear that teams were determined to play in their own stadiums even though home advantage may count for little as all matches will be without spectators.
 Madeira-based side Maritimo were the most outspoken and the club's football director Nuno Pereira said they would launch a legal challenge if they were not allowed to play in their own Barreiros stadium.
 "Our stadium meets all the requirements, it is one of the most modern in Portuguese football," he told RTP television.
 "There are not many COVID-19 cases in Madeira, the situation is under control. If we are forced to go to stay on the mainland, the players would be confined in a hotel and they would be running a greater risk in health terms.
 "It also puts us at a disadvantage in relation to our opponents. It would devalue the championship."
 Portimonense's majority shareholder Theodoro Fonseca said it would be an injustice if the Algarve-based club were not allowed to play at their Municipal Stadium.
 "We fulfill all the requirements," he said. "I will be very sad if they make us play somewhere else."
 The sports daily A Bola said that Benfica were reluctant to play any away matches in the stadium of arch-rivals Porto, which could be used as a host ground for a number of teams.
 Benfica also did not want their own stadium to host matches between other teams and Porto, it said. There was no official comment from Benfica.
 Vitoria Setubal were another to defend their right to play at home.
 "It's true that it's old and not completely as we would like, but there is an undeniable fact: the Bonfim stadium has everything that the DGS asks for," said club president Paulo Gomes in a statement.
 "The teams do not cross paths and they only need to go five meters to get to the pitch… Vitoria is Setubal's team and we will fight to continue playing in Setubal, although this doesn't mean we will put a spanner in the works of the championship." (Writing by Brian Homewood Editing by Toby Davis)

En cuanto a las instituciones, deberán asegurar un espacio vigilado para el resguardo de la bicicleta de forma gratuita como ya ocurre en las inmediaciones de la Casa de Gobierno.
