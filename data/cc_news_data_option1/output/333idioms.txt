Vázquez came under fire on Saturday after an online blogger posted a live feed of a warehouse in the southern coastal city of Ponce filled with water, cots, baby food and other supplies dating from Hurricane Maria.

Arkansas Right To Life will hold its Bowties for Babies fundraiser from 6 to 8:30 p.m. Monday, at the Benton Event Center.
 "It is a novel way to celebrate the work Arkansas Right to Life has done over its 45 years," said Executive Director Rose Mimms. "We have saved a lot of lives in 45 years."
 Arkansas Right to Life and its affiliates work to fight against abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia.
 Mimms believes this fundraiser will be a great event with a photo booth, children's choir and more.
 The keynote speaker will be former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.
 "He's been a great friend," Mimms said.
 She called him the "first pro-life governor" adding that during his time as governor, Huckabee championed legislation Right to Life worked on and worked with the legislature to get it passed.
 The reception to meet with Huckabee before the event is sold out.
 Starting at 5 p.m., attendees can enjoy the photo booth that will be set up.
 The meal for the evening, featuring bow tie and other types of pastas, will be catered by Vibrant Occasions Catering.
 The master of ceremony for the evening will be Doc Washburn, host of the Doc Washburn show.
 The East Union Missionary Baptist Church Children's Choir, directed by Josh Bazar, will perform.
 After dinner, Dr. David O'Steen, executive direction for the National Right to Life Committee, will give introductions.
 Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, will give the State of Abortion address.
 After Huckabee speaks, Happy Caldwell, CEO of Victory Television Network, will lead the prayer of petition.
 Arkansas Right to Life President Andy Mayberry will give a special presentation.
 During the event, they will show a video about aborted children called "What Was I Supposed to Be?"
 There will be a silent auction featuring gift baskets, a breakfast for four and tour of the Benton Central Fire Station and two of the event centerpieces.
 Mimms thinks the gift baskets would make great Valentine's Day gifts.
 The Gold sponsor for the evening is Lt. Governor Tim Griffin. The Silver sponsors are Everett Buick GMC and Triple-S Alarms. The bronze sponsors are Dr. Thomas and Mary Beth Tinnesz, Jeffrey and Katherine Silk, Doug and Wendy Young, Marvin and Kristi Parks, A.J.

The decision by European signatories of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to trigger a mechanism that could lead to UN sanctions against Iran is a "disaster" for Europe, Zarif said during an interview with Germany's Der Spiegel magazine. He claimed that, behind closed doors, European leaders have admitted that they dare not defy US President Donald Trump's unilateral decision to pull out from the accord and to implement sanctions.

"I think '81, didn't exactly sneak up on us," Policy said. "Once Joe started in 1980, that was a little spark there toward the end of that season. Bill was actually thinking of quitting after the first year. That's how bad it got. During the beginning of the second year he was having some problems, like, 'Whoa, what's going on here? Do I have this in me?' But then Joe took over at the quarterback position and there was a little bit of a spark. Then we had the draft."
