Amber Heard has accused ex-husband Johnny Depp of abusing her both physically and verbally and that at various times during their tempestuous relationship she feared for her life. On the first day of her testimony at Britain's High Court in London on Monday in Depp's libel trial against The Sun newspaper over an April 2018 article that labelled him a "wife beater," Heard also denied accusations she was a heavy drug-taker and drinker as well as being controlling and abusive herself."I was never violent towards him," she said in court. "When I felt my life was threatened, I tried to defend myself."Depp, 57, is suing The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star, who strongly denies abusing Heard, was at the court to hear his ex- wife's evidence. Heard's testimony is due to last for three days.She also described an incident in January 2015 in a hotel room in Tokyo over a prenuptial agreement between herself and Depp, and suggested there was an argument about it. "There was an argument in a hotel room in Tokyo that resulted in Johnny kneeling on my back and hitting me on the back of the head," she said.In written testimony released as she took to the witness box, Heard said she worried Depp would kill her at various times during their relationship that saw her enduring "punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking." She also said "some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far."According to the 34-year-old Heard, Depp "explicitly threatened to kill me many times, especially later in our relationship" and that he blamed his actions on "a self-created third party" that he referred to as "the monster."Heard said Depp has "a unique ability to use his charisma to convey a certain impression of reality" and that he is "very good at manipulating people." Heard has been present throughout the trial, watching the proceedings as her ex-husband gave evidence over five days.She is facing questioning over 14 allegations of domestic violence that The Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers is relying on in its defence of the April 2018 article.Depp and Heard met in 2009 on the set of the film The Rum Diary, which was released two years later. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.The Sun's defence relies on the 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and the couple's downtown Los Angeles penthouse. Depp claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to "a crime scene waiting to happen."In nine days of testimony at the High Court, judge Andrew Nicol has heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who have backed his version of events.Heard claimed in her written testimony that Depp "often didn't remember what he had done" because of the amount of alcohol and drugs he had consumed, and that "it was as if it hadn't happened for him."

Packaging for a number of the products has already been changed, and the company expects to complete the process “very soon,” she said.
 The petition was posted by Briones Bedell, 17, who is about to start her senior year at a San Francisco Bay Area high school. Her family has shopped occasionally at the local Trader Joe’s, and she said Sunday night that offending labels remain throughout the store. Her family isn’t patronizing Trader Joe’s for the time being.
 She said she was encouraged by the company’s response but wants Trader Joe’s to commit to a timetable for removing the products with the ethnic-themed labels. She added that she is far from the first person to call public attention to this matter.
 While she understands that there are financial costs to relabeling or removing products, “the petition remains important because Trader Joe’s lacks the urgency to deal with this issue in the current climate,” she said.
 In her petition, Briones also calls into question the company’s story about the origin of the market’s mildly nautical theme. At the time, founder Joe Coulombe “had been reading a book called ‘White Shadows in the South Seas,’ and he’d been to the Disneyland Jungle Trip ride, and it all just…coalesced,” the company’s website says.

Rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot said on Monday that he was "saddened but not surprised" and called the allegations against him of offering money to a party MLA to switch to BJP as "baseless". The former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan said this was a clear attempt to undermine his reputation and take the focus away from the substantive issue he has raised against the party leadership of the state.
 "I am saddened but not surprised to be at the receiving end of such baseless and vexatious allegations being levelled against me. This is done solely to malign me and to stifle the legitimate concerns that I had raised against the party leadership of the state, as a member and MLA of INC. This attempt further aims at defaming me and attack my credibility," said Sachin Pilot in a statement.
 Without disclosing the amount offered, Rajasthan Congress MLA Giriraj Singh Malinga said at the talks held at Pilot's house he was offered money to switch allegiance to the BJP. The MLA said he subsequently told chief minister Ashok Gehlot about the plan.
 "I had a talk with Sachinji. He offered me money to join the BJP, but I refused, saying I will not join the saffron party," Malinga was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.
   
   
 Pilot, sacked as deputy CM and president of the Rajasthan Congress unit last week, said he more such lies are in the offing to tar his image.
 "I will be taking appropriate and strictest possible legal action against the MLA who was made to make these accusations. I am sure more such concocted allegations will be thrown at me to cause aspersions on my public image. But I shall be unfettered and remain firm in my beliefs and convictions," said Pilot.

The Catalan leg of the tour was initially planned for last week covering several towns and Barcelona, but the monarchy said it had postponed it and scaled it back to a short visit to a monastery because of the spike in virus cases in and around the regional capital.
 Protesters on Monday carried photos of Felipe upside down and letters completing the sentence “Catalonia doesn't have a king" during a march organized by ANC, the region's largest pro-independence civil society group.
 The march was headed to the Royal Monastery of Poblet, where the king and the queen were visiting, but police blocked access at the main road. Some of the activists tried to reach the monastery by venturing into nearby vineyards.
 High-speed and regular trains in and out of the northern Catalan city of Girona were also delayed or cancelled due to “acts of vandalism,” according to a tweet by Spain’s railway infrastructure operator, ADIF. A photo circulated on messaging apps showed tires burning on railways next to a sign showing a crossed out upside down image of a crown.
 Tensions between separatists in Catalonia, which has a population of 7.5 million, and those in support of Spanish unity came to a head in late 2017 following a banned referendum met with police violence that led to the prosecution of top elected officials and activists.

 Meanwhile, Black students have worked hard to create a sense of community among their limited numbers. They gather on Sproul Plaza each “Black Wednesday” to hang out and used demonstrations, including blockading the Golden Bear Cafe, to successfully lobby for a Black Resource Center.
 The center, named after civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, opened in 2017 and has become a sanctuary. Another gathering spot is the African American themed dorm.
 The resource center features African art, a library and an altar dedicated to ancestors bearing flowers and inspiring messages. During a recent visit, students studied and socialized; some snacked on pupusas and built “vision boards” to set their intentions for the new decade.

Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines told its pilots last week that it could avoid furloughs for at least a year if the union agrees to a temporary 15% reduction in the minimum hours guarantee (currently 65 hours per month). More than 1,700 Delta pilots have accepted early retirement offers, and management proposed the reduced guarantee as a way to distribute the available work evenly among the remaining pilots. The initial reaction from Delta's chapter of ALPA was cool. Union officials recommended starting with additional voluntary measures like partially paid leaves of absence.

The Shiv Sena has called the phone-tapping order by the ruling Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan, which is caught in a bitter internal power struggle with the sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot's faction of 19 rebel lawmakers, an assault on personal freedom and termed the attempt to bring down a democratically elected dispensation "unconstitutional".
 Saamana, the Sena mouthpiece, carried an editorial on Monday that stated the jury is still out on which is a bigger crime - a state government order for phone tapping or a bid to topple a democratically elected government.
 The Gehlot government has claimed that there has been a concerted bid to dislodge the ruling dispensation following the surfacing of three audiotapes last Thursday evening that quickly went viral on social media.
 The Congress has accused Jodhpur Member of Parliament (MP) and Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as the villain of the piece in cahoots with two dissident party lawmakers in an alleged plot to oust the Gehlot government.
 The tapes did make a reference to one Gajendra Singh, which bolstered the Congress, to accuse him of indulging in horse-trading.
 The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has sought a report from Rajasthan chief secretary over the alleged "illegal tapping of phones".
 "Phone tapping is an offence and assault on personal freedom. It is treachery to bring down a democratically elected government by the lure of lucre. However, it needs to be decided which one is a bigger crime," the editorial said.
 "There is nothing wrong if the MHA wants to probe the phone-tapping incident. But the key question is: if the Gehlot government has indeed eavesdropped the purported phone conversations, what state of emergency had erupted in the state or the country?" it asked.
 The Marathi daily made a play for the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi.
 It said several skeletons would tumble out of the cupboard, if the conversations among power-hungry Congress leaders became public and they reached Gandhi. It cited that the disputes within the Congress's ranks are unending and a certain section within Gandhi's party didn't want him to succeed.
 "The Rajasthan phone-tapping episode has exposed many. But, a lot of revelation will come to the fore if someone hears the secret conversations among Congress leaders and they reach Gandhi. Some people have been hell-bent on not letting Gandhi work properly. This is hurting the entire opposition," it said.
 The editorial said that Gehlot has foiled the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) plans amid the generational war between the Rajasthan CM and his challenger Pilot.
 "The deal, which was on between the BJP and Pilot, was about an exchange of cash for power. It was decided that the elected Rajasthan government would be brought down by horse-trading through cash inducements," the editorial alleged.
 "CM Gehlot exposed Pilot's rebellion, which was less against injustice, and brought to light by the phone conversations between the sacked deputy CM and BJP leaders. It is both shocking and sensational," it further alleged.
 The editorial questioned the BJP's radio silence over Shekhawat's alleged role.
 "Why those who are seeking the President's rule in Rajasthan have not made Shekhawat resign? First, make Shekhawat resign, atone for poaching of the lawmakers and then point a finger towards the Gehlot government," the editorial said while adding that phone tapping is not restricted to Rajasthan alone.
 The Sena also took a potshot at ally-turned-rival BJP.
 "In the Rajasthan episode, the condition of the BJP is such that they set out to do something, but something contrary happened … games are being played these days to weaken opponents politically, socially and mentally by dislodging them from their governments (across states)," it signed off.

On Sunday night, after three days of fruitless talks and with hope dimming, Michel implored leaders to overcome their fundamental divisions and agree on the budget and recovery fund.
 “Are the 27 EU leaders capable of building European unity and trust or, because of a deep rift, will we present ourselves as a weak Europe, undermined by distrust?” he asked the leaders. The text of the behind-closed-doors speech was obtained by the Associated Press.
 “I wish that we succeed in getting a deal and that the European media can headline tomorrow that the EU succeeded in a Mission Impossible,” Michel said.
 The pandemic has sent the EU into a tailspin, killing about 135,000 of its citizens and plunging its collective economy into an estimated contraction of 8.3% this year.

Amid the hits and outs, Scully sprinkled in descriptions of the various tourist spots he claimed to have visited that morning. The Dodgers won the game, and the broadcast went off without a hitch.
 “I never let on anything,” Scully said. “However, about two days later, I got a letter from a woman, and she said she was the head of the bird watchers of America, and she said, ‘Mr. Scully, it was so exciting for us to hear the game, because we could hear a red-throated swallow,’ or whatever it was. She was so thrilled about the fact that she had heard this rare bird in the Bahamas.
 “And, of course, that was the tape from Florida.”
 The retired Scully, 92, widely regarded as the finest broadcaster in baseball history, said he is looking forward to watching the games this season. Broadcasters are not scheduled to travel in this pandemic-shortened season, so Joe Davis and Orel Hershiser will call games off television monitors in Los Angeles when the Dodgers are on the road.

“Arboretums will swap seeds and seedlings to help the other arboreta expand their collections,” Delissio said. “We’ve become part of a larger network.”
 Greenlawn, a celebrated walking destination for North Shore residents going back generations, has hosted the arboretum since it was established under the New Deal in the mid-1930s. Workers funded by President Franklin Roosevelt’s landmark program planted hundreds of labeled trees, shrubs and more across the cemetery.
 “We have trees from all over the world,” Delissio said. “It hit home for me when I took a group of students there in the spring of 2019, and we met with community members. One of my students recognized a ‘cedar of Lebanon,’ which is on the flag of his home country. ... It started a conversation with him about how his family, which has spread out around the world, and how they have taken plants from their home country.”
 Accreditation is a privilege in its own right. Only about 400 members of ArbNet have landed accreditation at various levels, with 13 of them in Massachusetts specifically, according to Delissio. The Sargent Arboretum landed Level 1 accreditation, the first level to the program, through a partnership between the city, the Friends of Greenlawn Cemetery and an upper- level botany course at Salem State taught by Delissio.

Crowd noise, without the actual crowd.
 That’s what baseball broadcasts will feature this season, presented as if it were a cutting-edge concept. It is not. The Dodgers did it 52 years ago. They just didn’t advertise it.

Where do these jocks get the nerve to do this? They possess no great wisdom or insight. Yet they are on a pedestal as far as the media is concerned. No, it's that sports have far too much prestige in American society. At too many colleges, sports have become the tail that wags the dog. It's long past time for colleges to de-emphasize sports and focus instead on reclaiming high academic standards. But that can't happen. High academic standards run against the grain of Black Lives Matter and identity politics in general. And until the fans start putting sports into proper perspective, coaches will reign high and have an inflated sense of importance.

Trader Joe’s has responded to criticisms about its packaging by announcing that it is in the process of eliminating labels that use ethnic-sounding names intended to be humorous.
 The offending products bear such labels as Trader Ming’s for foods and condiments related to Chinese cuisine, Trader José's for Mexican-style products and Trader Giotto’s for Italian-themed items.
 The company has come under fire in part from a petition, posted for about two weeks, on the Change.org website. It had collected more than 2,000 signatures by Sunday night.
 The labels, which offer variations of the Trader Joe’s name, exploit “a narrative of exoticism that perpetuates harmful stereotypes,” according to the petition.
