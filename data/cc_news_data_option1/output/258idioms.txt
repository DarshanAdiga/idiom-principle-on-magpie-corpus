 “The psychological impact of crimes such as this can be considerable but we hope today's sentence brings some degree of closure now that Andoh is behind bars – where he belongs.
 “We will always take reports of this kind of crime extremely seriously and we’d encourage anyone who feels they have been the victim of such offences to get in touch with police.”

Not all practice makes perfect, but all practice does make permanent. Be deliberate in the skills you practice. Instead of focusing on what you already do well, focus on what you don’t know well. If a communications coach says your handshake is solid but your eye contact needs work, don’t continue working on your handshake. Instead, make a concentrated effort to connect with the eyes of your listener in every interaction. Allow yourself to feel the awkwardness of unnatural behaviors until they become second nature. If your coach says your communication style in meetings is warm and receptive but your emails come across as abrupt and rude, focus your efforts on that. Put your energy into the skill that needs work until it becomes your new normal.

The National Mall is dotted with memorials and monuments that honor our nation's most influential leaders. It's appropriate that the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial is situated along this treasured area.
 Dr. King was a humble public servant who dedicated his life to pursing justice and fairness for all people. His leadership in the civil rights movement was about spurring America to live up to the ideals of our founding: liberty and equality under the law, for all. In their righteous pursuit of that goal, the leaders, activists and participants championing this cause for African Americans helped make the United States a more perfect Union.
 The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once visited Arkansas where he addressed the 1958 graduating class of Arkansas AM&N College (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff). He told the crowd of over 1,000 that each of us "must be measured by his soul," and continued, saying, "we are challenged to enter the new age with understanding in our hearts."
 The civil rights movement, at its foundation, was intertwined with faith and spirituality. The call to ensure equality and justice for every American was just as much based on a biblical ethic as anything else, so it's fitting prayer breakfast events are held all over the country to celebrate Dr. King's memory and contributions. I recently attended the annual MLK Prayer Breakfast at the University of Central Arkansas to celebrate this remarkable leader's legacy.
 Dr. King's faith certainly played an undeniable role in shaping his perspective and activism. He, alongside so many others in the movement, echoed the belief that a higher power demanded all his children be afforded the value and dignity they inherently possess.
 We can all be encouraged by how far we've come in this regard, and that progress bears the unmistakable mark of Dr. King. Our nation owes him so much and his legacy richly deserves this reverence and admiration.
 Just five short years after addressing the students at AM&N, Dr. King led the March on Washington and gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.
 To this day, school children learn of the memorable, moving refrains of that address. Thankfully, today those same children sit in integrated classrooms, learning about what makes each of them different and unique from one another, but also about how much they share in common with their friends who might look different than they do.
 That may seem ordinary now, but it is something worth reflecting on and celebrating. And no reflection or celebration would be complete without acknowledging the immense contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 As we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day let us join together to continue the important work of striving for justice, equality and unity.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - Charleston celebrated Dr. Martin Luther King day with a rally that addressed education, gun violence and other issuesAround 100 people came to Marion Square to celebrate Dr. King’s legacy. Speakers talked about several issues that Dr. King would have addressed if he were alive today.Education was a hot topic on the cold day. People of all ages were on hand where they heard a demand for change.Patrick Martin, a teacher at Wando High School and founder of the Safe Schools Project, called for more attention to students’ mental health. He also quoted from an article that Dr. King wrote for his college newspaper at the age of 18. In that article the civil rights leader wrote that teachers and all people need to be careful."We all need to be careful. We must be careful not to let slip the immediacy of the cause. We must strike while the iron is hot. We must not fall prey to the small notion that things will not change, we must stand up together and demand change now," Martin said.The rally also addressed gun violence.Charleston Police Chief Luther Reynolds noted that eight people died from gun violence in the city in 2019 and one already this year.Reynolds said guns being left in unlocked cars is an ongoing issue that is getting worse."These same guns by their very nature, once they're stolen are in the hands of criminals and are being used against our community members in aggravated assaults, shootings and other crimes, " Reynolds said.Monday’s rally was sponsored by “The Coaltion” led by Pastor Thomas Dixon.Copyright 2020 WCSC.

Going strictly by the numbers, the AMG should rule them all and in its initial race, the X7 is indeed left staring at Mercedes taillights. Despite having the most power, the Bimmer also carries the most bulk and frankly, the outcome against the considerably smaller AMG isn’t a surprise.
