Some of those people will be musicians, Hartman's sure of it. She's shared her story and her advice on recovery with fellow artists struggling with dependency, partially out of debt.
 "I feel like I owe folk punk a lot because everything that I have is because of the community. They embraced me with open arms when I was still screaming out of key and terrible at playing guitar years and years ago. They told me I had to get better. They embraced me," she said.
 "I talk to people a lot. Honestly, I feel sometimes like I'm sponsoring half of the punk community," she continued. "I don't do 12-step and I don't sponsor people but I sometimes feel like I'm a lot of people's sponsor, a lot of people I've never met. Just being a listening ear, it means a lot to people when they're going through something.
 "Like I said, my recovery has been all about becoming okay with myself. You can do that with or without people around you," she said. "My biggest advice to people is to find something to live for. For me it was music, for anyone else it can be anything else. It's art, it's a hobby, it's whatever you pick up in recovery that makes you want to get out every day and feel whole. It might be what you did when you were a kid before society got a hold of you and told you that you need to make money. It's whatever you can find a passion for. Whatever you can be passionate about that gets you out of your head when you do it, that's what you need to chase in your recovery and not worry about what other people say about it or if other people are going to judge you for it. Just do it because you love it."

The bad news came on May 5 - an email from the Houston Arts Alliance informing theater companies that, due to the negative economic impact of COVID 19, the grant money they'd been promised would be reduced going forward. By 6 percent for the first quarter and a warning of "significant reduction" for the remaining quarters.
 It was yet another blow to theaters, who are already struggling under the financial strain of canceled shows, shuttered facilities and an uncertain production resumption time frame.
 A blow, but not necessarily a shock.
 The grant money HAA administers comes from the state-mandated Hotel Occupancy Tax. The money is collected during a fiscal quarter and then one month later, the Houston First Corporation which operates performing arts and convention facilities in the city, collects the funds, sends them to the city, and, five days later the city sends HAA the portion that goes to fund the city's arts organizations. Two weeks later, HAA distributes the money.
 But in the midst of a pandemic, when hotels are reporting anywhere between a 70 -100 percent drop in business, there is little, if any money to collect and distribute. This means the largest, and in some cases, the only source of public funding that theaters receive may now be off the table.
 The impact this will have on companies differs from organization to organization. Both Rec Room Arts and Catastrophic Theatre rely on HOT funds for approximately 10 percent  of their annual budget while the money represents around 6 percent of the Alley Theatre's operating budget. Different percentages, but to put it in perspective, for all three companies, the HOT funding model subsidizes an entire production and is crucial to the financial health of a season.
 With this model now presently broken, it's left some wondering why Houston is beholden to this system of funding and questioning if there's a better way to publicly support the arts in Houston.

operativa, nelle Marche, la modalità semplificata di assegnazione del gasolio agricolo. La Regione ha anche stabilito il regolamento per beneficiare dei contributi destinati alla “vendemmia verde”: la pratica agronomica, prevista dalla Ue, che consente di regolare la produzione enologica, eliminando, manualmente, i grappoli di uva ancora non maturi. Le due delibere sono state adottate oggi dalla Giunta regionale, con lo scopo, spiega la vicepresidente della Regione Marche Anna Casini, assessore all’Agricoltura, “di fornire un aiuto agli imprenditori agricoli in questa delicata fase di ripartenza, dopo il lockdown. La presentazione delle domande, per il gasolio, avverrà in modalità telematica con assegnazione immediata di un anticipo parametrato ai consumi dell’anno precedente. Un aiuto che forniamo agli operatori agricoli, dando loro la possibilità di ricevere subito una parte del combustibile necessario per la corrente annata agraria”. Per quanto riguarda, invece, la viticoltura, “è un settore trainante l’economia agricola regionale che vogliamo sostenere con tutte le opportunità offerta dalla legislazione nazionale ed europea”.
 Gli interessati all’utilizzo di gasolio agricolo agevolato possono accedervi in modalità semplificata di assegnazione dell’anticipo, tramite il Sistema Informativo Regionale (SIAR), fino all’ 80% della quantità prelevata nell’annualità precedente, prima di effettuare la denuncia di avvenuto impiego dell’annualità in corso. L’assegnazione dell’anticipo è effettuata in assenza della denuncia di avvenuto impiego dell’anno precedente. Alla richiesta di anticipo deve far seguito la presentazione della dichiarazione di avvenuto impiego per l’anno 2019, ordinariamente entro il 30 giugno di ogni anno ed eccezionalmente, per la sola annualità corrente, fino al 31 luglio 2020. In caso di inadempimento la struttura regionale competente attiva il procedimento per il recupero dell'accisa per quantitativi non dovuti e consumati prima della richiesta annuale, sul carburante agricolo agevolato prelevato a titolo di anticipo, nonché del carburante assegnato nell’anno precedente. L'assegnazione annuale definitiva, preceduta dalla dichiarazione di avvenuto impiego per l’anno precedente, sarà poi effettuata al momento della presentazione della richiesta annuale secondo quanto previsto dalla normativa di riferimento.
 Per quanto riguarda la misura Vendemmia verde, il regolamento si applica sull’intero territorio regionale. A disposizione ci sono contributi (da richiede tramite portale Sian) per favorire il mantenimento dell’equilibrio tra offerta e domanda sul mercato vitivinicolo, eliminando le eccedenze e lasciando inalterato il potenziale produttivo, nel rispetto del valore paesaggistico e delle tradizioni culturali del territorio. Gli impianti che possono beneficiare del contributo devono avere almeno quattro anni di vita e un’estensione tra i 5.000 e i 50.000 metri quadri. A disposizione ci sono 250 mila euro per tutti i viticoltori interessati.

4/9/2020 - Flowserve was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a "hold" rating to a "sell" rating. They now have a $30.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, "We believe that Flowserve is poised to benefit from strengthening end markets -- including oil and gas, chemical as well as thermal solar -- and transformational initiatives in the long run. The company invests its funds primarily to enhance organic growth and Flowserve 2.0, a multi-year program. Moreover, it is committed toward rewarding shareholders handsomely through dividend payouts and share repurchase programs. The company's solid liquidity position enables it to cover its immediate liabilities. However, its shares have underperformed the industry in the past three months. Also, the company has withdrawn its guidance for 2020 on end-market uncertainties stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. Restructuring expenses and high debt levels can be detrimental to the company. Its earnings estimates have been lowered for 2020 and 2021."

Cantwell asked the Department of Transportation to encourage airlines to keep every other seat open or limit the number of people allowed to board planes, and ensure passengers are able to maintain 6 feet of separation in airport queues and while waiting to board the aircraft.
 Absent overarching guidelines, airlines and airports have implemented "inconsistent measures," Cantwell wrote, to lessen the chance passengers and workers contract coronavirus.
 Some airports, including in Hawaii, began screening passengers for fever back in April; Sea-Tac plans to begin doing so in coming weeks. The Transportation Security Administration revealed last week it would also begin checking travelers' temperatures, The Wall Street Journal reported, but did not say at which airports. Sea-Tac has asked to be part of the program, airport spokeswoman Kate Hudson said, but has not heard back from the agency.
 While most large airports now require travelers to cover their faces, policies are spottier at regional airports — travelers through Spokane International Airport, for instance, don't need to wear masks. Sea-Tac's mandatory mask policy takes effect Monday, and applies to passengers and staff, but not workers such as baggage handlers employed by airlines.
 Airline rules aren't uniform, either. Crew members and passengers on all airlines operating at Sea-Tac are required to wear masks, but some travelers have said on their flights, the rule wasn't enforced. And even airlines that initially announced they would keep middle seats open to provide for a modicum of social distance onboard have pointed to fine-print caveats as photos and videos of packed flights surfaced on social media in recent days.
 United Airlines pledged to automatically block middle seats, but then said it can't guarantee passengers will be seated next to an unoccupied seat. Alaska Airlines also said it would block off many seats — with the caution "extra space between guests is not guaranteed and is subject to weight and balance restrictions" through the end of June.

"It's a frustrating system for funding to be so contingent on something that's kind of unrelated," says Shayna Schlosberg, managing director of Catastrophic Theatre. "It's really crushing for the community regardless of whether tourism is booming in the city or not. Houston should support its artists because Houstonians benefit just as much from our cultural community. So, what does it say about the way we value arts and the artists that live and contribute to the culture of the city to say, well, we're not able to profit off you right now, so hang tight!"
 Schlosberg points to Denver's model of arts funding as a system that enables support to come from within the community, while better safeguarding the funds from emergency situations. Called The Scientific and Cultural Facilities District, this voter-approved public funding method applies a penny sales tax on every $10 purchase within the seven-county metro area, annually distributing about $50 million in operations funding to arts, culture and scientific organizations.
 However, as anyone that lives in Texas knows, tax is a dirty word in this state.
 Prior to becoming the Alley Managing Director, Dean Gladden was involved in establishing the public arts funding in Cleveland which levies a county- controlled sin tax on cigarettes that he estimates generates approximately $5 million a year to all the arts organizations in the county.
 "I would love to see something like they did in Cleveland here," says Gladden. "It would provide far more money than the HOT and absolutely would be beneficial for the city and all the arts organizations." So, has he broached the subject with the powers that be? "In all my conversations that I've had with people in Austin, there's been no appetite to do something like Cleveland," says Gladden. "This is a state that doesn't like to tax its citizens and has a long history of low taxes and that is completely different than Ohio or other states. The politics are the politics."
 Rec Room Artistic Director, Matt Hune agrees that increasing local taxes is a nonstarter. Instead, he's interested in exploring options within the present system. "We cringe when adding taxes so HOT has been an easy way to fund the arts in the past because it's not our local people paying for it," says Hune. "But Houston isn't necessarily a tourism city. Even if we do keep the HOT, is there a different percentage we can look at, or a way to add an endowment so that if something like this virus happens, or another hurricane, it's OK and the money still is there for the arts when we need it most?"
 Something for example like San Francisco has done.
 In a November 2018 ballot vote, the city approved a measure to shift 1.5 percent of hotel tax revenue to non-profit arts and cultural services. But what this measure also did was allocate a portion of the existing HOT into an Arts Impact Endowment - a rainy day fund if you will. It provides money to be held back for times of crises - like a pandemic.
 On March 30, the Mayor of San Francisco announced that the city was releasing $1.5 million from the Endowment to be distributed among 527 individual artists and 65 arts organizations struggling to survive the coronavirus shutdown. For organizations, this meant funds could be used for staff salaries, artist payments, rent, and other operating costs.
 When asked why Houston doesn't have a similar safety net as part of its HOT funding model, Director of the Mayor's Office for Cultural Affairs, Debbie McNulty, said that the City of Houston has, for 20 years, allocated the maximum percentage of HOT allowable to HAA for grants. "An emergency fund of any meaningful size significantly reduces funding available for annual grant allocations," says McNulty. "Mayor Sylvester Turner has joined with other city mayors to call on federal legislators to provide relief for the arts and cultural community in the next COVID relief package."
 Houston Arts Alliance CEO John Abodeely acknowledges that our present mode of arts funding could use some work. "There are pros and cons to HOT," says Abodeely. "There were elements where there were cracks in the system that this pandemic has split wide open. But in other ways, there is a commitment by our elected officials, written into law, that funds the arts. It is flawed and we can fix it, but it is not simply just terrible."
 That written into law and yearly commitment by politicians isn't something Houston arts organizations should take lightly. "You're not going to hear me complain about what we have," says Gladden. "Because I know that could go away and then we have nothing."
 Abodeely brings up Kansas as a cautionary tale of ceased public funding. In 2011 Kansas became the first state in the nation to stop funding the arts when its governor vetoed $700,000 for the former arts commission and instead maintained that arts organizations should be funded by private dollars alone. Kansas has since reversed that decision, but many across the nation still believe that private funding exclusively is the way to go.
 To that notion, Schlosberg responds, "We already operate under a model that is not reliant on public funding. In order to survive as a non-profit, an organization has to have a diversified mix of funding sources, and part of that is government funding.
 "The answer to this crisis is not to move away entirely from public funding. In addition to providing much-needed funds, government support helps us attract other sources of funding. Individuals and foundations ask to see who our major funders are before deciding to support us. Government support provides a sort of 'seal of approval' to new, potential donors. It's not one or the other--in fact, one leads to the other in some cases."

Prakarana granthas are aids to help beginners get initiated into Vedanta study which alone can equip one with the drive, means and practices to attain Brahma Jnana, said Sri R. Rajagopala Sarma in a discourse. This is the final goal that liberates one from the cycle of samsara, say the scriptures. They also show the difficulties in knowing/ realising/ attaining Brahman though He is all pervading, all knowing and all powerful. When caught in this world, the jivatma is mired in ignorance of the true values. Just as it is difficult to try to identify objects in dim light, the jivatma gropes to seek the eternal truth in this immediate world of change and sense perceptions which he considers as the reality. But even in this context, there is no guarantee that his observations and conclusions are true and valid since he has to deal with layers of misconceptions that can easily distort his opinion and judgment.
 For instance, it is possible for one to mistake a rope for a snake in inadequate light and then experience fear and confusion about its presence until such time when with the help of light only the rope is seen. All along, there was no snake at all. This is the analogy quoted in scriptures to show that this universe and creation is the superimposition on Brahman. Lack of knowledge or partial knowledge makes one think of this world as the reality. But it is Brahman who has created this entire universe and is also present in each and every aspect of it. Brahman supports all of this and is the cause for its dissolution as well. Brahman alone is the eternal Truth and the jagat is a superimposition. The inner self in each being is of the nature of this Brahman. This is the Brahma Jnana that dispels ignorance and thereby gradually leads one into the path of liberation.

Curtis Murdock Dunn, beloved husband, father, father in-law, grandfather, great grandfather, brother-in law, uncle, cousin, mentor, and a special friend to everyone, died peacefully with family by his side on May 11, 2020. Curtis was an only child born on October 31, 1935, in Peterborough, NH, to Curtis Valentine Dunn and Marion (Barnes) Dunn. He was raised in Mason, NH, and became a life-long resident. Curtis went to Mason Village School and graduated from Spaulding Memorial High School in Townsend, MA, where he played on the basketball team, nickname "Elbows Dunn". In 1949 he joined the Mason Congregational Church and has been a lifelong member. He married the love of his life, Sara Ann Moran of New Ipswich, NH, in 1956. Together they raised their family and enjoyed over 50 years of marriage. Shortly after their wedding, Curtis faithfully served his nation in the United States Army and Army Reserves and was honorably discharged in 1964.      Early on in his career Curtis worked as a supervisor for the Rowse Company Cider Mill in Greenville, NH, and as a machine technician at Weyerhaeuser in Fitchburg, MA. His dream job didn't start until 1973 when the Town of Mason hired Curtis as their first full-time Road Agent. He was the only employee and started out with two shovels, a rake, a chain-saw and an old military truck. The historic flood of 1986 tested Curtis and his crew of three, as they worked with FEMA to repair the damage. After more than 26 years as Road Agent, Curtis retired in 2000. Curtis was a proud long-time member of the Mason Volunteer Fire Department and a former Assistant Fire Chief.      In 2018, he was honored by the NH Fire Service and Emergency Medical Services Committee of Merit for his 53 years of dedication to the NH Fire Service as a Deputy Warden. Curtis mentored Mason youth through 4-H leadership and working with the Junior Fire Department, the Youth Corp. and the CETA Program which provided part time help from teenagers who needed a great deal of training and supervision. Curtis believed in hard work, volunteerism and giving back to his community. Each year he looked forward to the annual Fire Department/Wolf Rockers fundraising event which he managed: the famous Mason Chicken BBQ. He broke the record for ticket sales each year. It gave him a reason to catch up with people while raising money for a great community cause, an accomplishment he was very proud of. Along with his wife Sara, Curtis was a charter member of the Mason Wolf Rockers Square Dance Club founded in 1968. They enjoyed thirty- eight years of square dancing together with their very special friends and traveling to the annual New England and National Square Dance Conventions.      A "people person" defined Curtis to a tee. Everywhere he went, everyone he met, he would touch their lives through his storytelling, his sense of humor, his kindness, his joy of life, infectious smile, and that twinkle in his eye. Curtis also had a love of horse pulling and became a member of the Eastern Draft Horses Association, thus adding a whole new group of special friends to his life.      Anyone who knew Curtis, knew he was a big sports fan, especially a Boston Celtics fan. For 33 years he had home game season tickets and enjoyed inviting friends and family to join him for that special experience of being at the Boston Garden. Curtis loved to tell the story that he was at the first game Larry Bird stepped out onto the parquet floor when a white dove flew into the rafters. What a thrill!      Everything about Mason, Curtis loved. Some people referred to him as "The Mayor of Mason", as he served on many town committees and was always a part of community life. One of his favorite places was Parker's Maple Barn, he was a regular there, and the staff adored him. His 80th birthday was celebrated at Parker's with a barn full of friends and family, including his "adopted daughter" Michelle Knowles, who managed the restaurant. His cousins from Nova Scotia made a surprise appearance adding to the excitement. Curtis and his family spent many vacations visiting his Canadian cousins who meant the world to him.      Curtis is predeceased by his wife Sara, and is survived by his daughter, Susan, and her husband Jonathan Bartley, of Candia, NH; his son, Stephen, and his wife Sheila, of Mason, NH; his grandson, Stephen, of Portsmouth, NH; his grandson, Mark, and his wife Amanda, and his great-grandson, Weston, of Amherst, NH. Curtis leaves behind his special friend, Karin Eisenhaure, of Mason, NH.      His family is very grateful to the staff of nurses and nurse's assistants at the Courville of Manchester, who took great care of Curtis for more than a year. They became his second family and truly loved him.      A private funeral service was held at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Mason, led by Reverend Veronica Don of the Mason Congregation Church. There will be a Celebration of Life for family and friends at a later date. In Curtis's memory donations may be made to the Mason Fire-EMS Department, 101 Depot Road, Mason, NH, 03048, or to the Mason Congregational Church, 33 Valley Road, Mason, NH, 03048.      The arrangements are in the care of the Michaud Funeral Home, 32 Maple St., Wilton, NH. To view an online obituary or leave a condolence, please visit our web site at www.michaudfuneralhome.com

 The meeting also deliberated upon the feasibility of resumption of inter- district services. These are likely to be operational, subject to conditions of social distancing. The discussions entailed proposals pertaining to operational procedures such as where a bus travelling from a district and entering Hyderabad district would halt. It is likely that they will stop at bus station or bus stop in the peripheral areas of the city.
 With an emphasis on social distancing, their discussions touched upon reduction in passengers permitted per bus. For instance, a 48-seater will be permitted to have 22 to 24 passengers on board. Entry without masks will be barred and conductors will carry sanitisers which will be administered to passengers.
 A final call on these deliberations will be taken by the Cabinet.
 The TSRTC has 97 bus depots across Telangana nearly 10,000 buses, including over 2,000 hire buses. Before the lockdown, buses clocked a total of nearly 35.40 lakh km and transported 98.85 lakh passengers every day.
 For the past several years, the TSRTC has been dealing with losses. With the novel coronavirus pandemic bringing bus services to a grinding halt, the corporation is staring in the face of more financial troubles.

"It evolved, like in high school when my peers caught up with me, it turned into the partying thing and that just kind of kept going until it spiraled out of control through the end of college," she recalled. "I graduated and was drinking so much. I really started drinking alone a lot because I didn't want to handle life."
 "As far as appearances go, I was working, I looked as if I was okay, I wasn't out of money. But I realized I could continue to use drugs and I would never change who I was. I could use all the drugs in the world and it was like a bottomless pit. I was still me when the fog cleared and I didn't want to be me, I hated myself so much," she said. "So, I decided I was either going to kill myself or I was going to learn how to love me and the only way I could figure out how to love me was to put the drugs aside."
 Hartman played guitar as a youth, but "I never thought I'd be good enough to pursue it because I had this idea in my head that I had to do things that would bring me money or success or approval from my parents or society." She started writing music in 2014 when she left rehab and those songs set the stage for Apes of the State, which launched in 2015. It's now a high-profile band in the growing folk punk genre. It features songs about Hartman's 14 years of substance abuse and her ongoing recovery, fan favorites like "Timeline" and "Sober Intentions."
 "I would say it's like a cathartic release of a sober mind, essentially. I started writing songs basically as a way to cope with the newfound emotional chaos of sobriety. I never wrote songs in my life before I got sober. I write about topics that give me a lot of emotional response. It goes both ways, so not just sad but also happy, because in sobriety those emotional swings can be triggers, no matter what direction they're in. A lot of people talk about how they had an amazing day, so their first thought was to get high. Or, they had a really bad day, so their first thought was to get high. So, instead of getting high over those planes, I would just pick up my guitar and write a song about it."
 Isolation can be triggering for someone in recovery, but it's necessary in the current pandemic. Hartman said Apes was set to leave for tour March 12. They had a date at the massive Texas music fest Folk Shit Up, but cancelled just before the run's start and encouraged other bands to do the same.
 "The way I saw it is I speak so much about harm reduction when it comes to recovery things that it would be disingenuous to not take another public health crisis seriously. I saw it as the same thing," she said. "When I juggled it in my mind I thought, I can't say we should all carry Narcan and look out for our friends when I'm going to just go touring during a pandemic."
 Unable to have that human connection, and also unable to host touring acts at her home, which she frequently does, Hartman has found positive outlets for her energies during this downtime. Apes released a live album at the beginning of May, available on Bandcamp, Spotify and other streaming music platforms. She's focused on the band's merchandise sales. A friend, Ian Archibald of the Buffalo, New York band Cardboard Homestead, asked her to help develop a streaming music fest. They and others in the folk punk community pieced together Coping with Dystopia. Designed as a one-time event, the show was so successful its organizers kept it running. It's aired on YouTube, Switch and Facebook every Friday evening since March 20 and has raised more than $7,000 for grass roots charities. Sean Bonnette of AJJ and The Dead Milkmen's Joe Jack Talcum have been headliners. Apes of the State was the very first band to play the series.
 "We just really wanted a way to keep our scene active and together and communicating with each other through a music lens because when music scenes only exist through Facebook dialogue, they suck. We all start fighting with each other," she laughed. "We wanted to just remain positive and centered on the reason that brought us together, which is music.
 "Having music and then having the community right next to it in the YouTube chat is a huge part of it. It's not just about the stream and the music, it's about that chat that brings the people together every week. And, it feels like a community. That's what we've wanted to build and that's what we've succeeded in."
 Hartman knows there's also a large online presence for people in recovery. There are more than 60,000 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in the United States and many are switching to streaming platforms like Zoom to continue to serve their members. She said the growing number of online meetings can only help.
 "A lot of these have been around already for a while because some people live in rural areas and they've always faced these challenges," Hartman noted. "People in recovery that live in these isolated areas suddenly have thousands of meetings to choose from, thousands of support groups to choose from, whereas prior to that they maybe had one Facebook group. It's actually been better for some people that are used to dealing with isolation, but for others that are living in cities who are used to being able to get out it's more of a challenge."

The situation is even worse for African Americans, who were not hired to pilot a commercial airplane until the 1960s. Things changed only because of a six- year battle against Continental Airlines waged by Marlon Green, who filed a discrimination complaint against the carrier. In 1963, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in his favor, paving the way for the first black pilot, David Ellsworth Harris, whom American Airlines hired in 1964.

 These are not homilies being uttered by one we would think is beyond the pale of human needs, but the words of a human being such as you and I, with whom we probably all share the same emotions and feelings. A possible awakening is being made available to each of us. Can we embrace it and look forward to living with greater compassion, sensitivity towards one another and mindfulness than we have lived so far, or will we return to an existence of ostentation and opulence, lacking humane values, which might cut us off from one another? A question begging for introspection.

 Wir werfen einen Blick zurück und schauen uns an, warum das Konzept nicht sofort verboten wurde, nachdem einige Teams dadurch zu Beginn des Jahres einen enormen Vorteil hatten, und wie die anderen Teams im Verlauf der Saison darauf reagierten. Ausgangspunkt waren damals die großen Regeländerungen zur Saison 2009.
 Diese sollten dafür sorgen, dass die Piloten einem anderen Auto besser folgen konnten, was wiederum für mehr Überholmanöver sorgen sollte. Die Boliden verloren durch die neuen Regeln eine Menge Abtrieb. Die Designer suchten deshalb nach Wegen, diesen Verlust irgendwie auszugleichen.
 Drei Teams, die augenscheinlich keine Verbindung hatten, kamen dabei auf die Idee, ihrem Diffusor eine zweite Ebene hinzuzufügen. Angeblich existierte der Plan bereits ein Jahr zuvor, als die Designer von Super Aguri diese Idee für die Saison 2008 umsetzen wollten. Als sich das Team Mitte des Jahres auflöste, verteilten sich die Mitarbeiter in verschiedene Richtungen.

When Ojulari does ultimately return with the rest of his Tigers teammates, potentially as early as June 1, he'll do so with Marietta High School teammate Arik Gilbert. The two were standouts with the Blue Devils program, winning a state championship in 2019 for the first time since 1967-68.
 Gilbert, of course, is one of the most highly touted prospects of the entire 2020 class, ranked as the No. 1 tight end ever by 247Sports. The freshman tight end was projected to miss all of the spring recovering from a shoulder injury but was seen earlier this month training as well.
 Gilbert is such a unique player that Orgeron recently said in an interview on "Off the Bench" that he envisions the Tigers being able to use Gilbert in a "Calvin Johnson like" role.
 "The guy you've gotta look at is Arik Gilbert, I'm considering Arik Gilbert as a wide receiver," Orgeron said. "I can't wait for him to come back. Obviously we can use him at tight end but we can split him out at "X" and we can get some mismatches with this kid, especially in the redzone. He's going to be a nice target there for Myles Brennan.

The Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) 2020, along expected lines, has been postponed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
 “The revised schedule will be released in due course,” the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) issued a statement on Monday.
 The tournament was scheduled to begin on June 10.
 The fifth edition was to see eight teams with the final slated for July 12. However, the TNPL does have a window till September 15, and it remains to be seen whether the competition is hosted behind closed doors or not.
 Earlier, the decision over postponing the league depended on the lockdown period. “We still don’t know if there will be a partial lockdown or not in May. We have to wait and watch. Maybe the tournament will be postponed by two- three weeks depending on the lockdown,” a source told The New Indian Express.
 The previous edition of the tournament took place from the mid of July to the mid of August. The Chepauk Super Gillies, led by Kaushik Gandhi, beat the Dindigul Dragons, led by Narayan Jagadeesan, by 12 runs in the final at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.

Pakistan's top batsman Babar Azam on Monday played down comparisons with Indian run-machine Virat Kohli, saying it is not wise to do so as both are "different" kind of players.
 "I think it's better if you are not comparing. I have said that he is a different kind of a player, and I am a different player," Azam said a during a press conference.
 "I am only striving to bat well and help my team to victory every time i take to the field."
 With consistent performances across three formats, the 25-year-old Azam has been steadily rising up the ranks in recent years, while the Indian captain Kohli has already established himself as one of the greats of the game.
 Asked about the possibility of playing cricket behind closed doors in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, Azam said they are already used to it having played most of their homes series in near-empty stands in the grounds of UAE for more than 10 years.
 "We know better than other teams how it feels to play without crowd having played most of our cricket in Dubai in last 10 years.
 "It's not a great feeling for fans and it's not great for us also."
 No Test nation toured Pakistan for more than 10 years since the 2008 terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team near the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.
 The pandemic has led to either cancellation or postponement of all sports events and there is a cloud of uncertainty over the T20 World Cup, scheduled to be held in October-November in Australia.
 "Regarding the T20 World Cup, I am sure the ICC will take everything into consideration before taking a decision, and the PCB said it will go ahead with series in England later this summer only when they are 110 percent sure," Azam said.
 Last week, the star batsman took over the reins of Pakistan's white-ball cricket after being appointed as the ODI skipper.
 Azam, who was one of the world's leading batsmen across formats last year and already the T20 skipper, replaced wicket-keeper batsman Sarfaraz Ahmed as the ODI captain for the 2020-21 season.

So it's unlikely numbers are going up.
 "It is possible there's been a shift in the way wild animals use their territory," said Karvonen.
 "The more likely change is that people are now paying a bit more attention. They're not rushing off to work every day with their heads down. They have the time to look around and notice wild animals."
 And there are plenty of those in Toronto -- 300 different species, Karvonen said.
 That includes everything from subterranean moles to soaring falcons, and lots of wildlife we rarely see.  "Owls, for example, are active at night.
 "And there are bats all over the city."
 Karvonen talks about the beavers, mink and muskrat that live in Toronto, and mentions turtles, snakes and frogs in the same breath as groundhogs and cotton tail rabbits. She often tends to opossums with frostbite, because their naked ears and noses can't take the winter cold.
 She explained that Toronto is on an ancient migratory corridor -- nice for bird watchers -- that short tailed shrews are quite dangerous, and that peregrines in the city love eating pigeons.
 One change Karvonen does hope to see is that with fewer cars on the road, maybe female turtles going to their nesting area over the next month will not get run over.
 How about those baby foxes everyone has seen in the Beaches?
 "Unfortunately, people are training them by feeding them," she said. The animals will eventually have to unlearn that behaviour.
 And the bears?
 There are no bears in the big city, said Karvonen, laughing.
 "Black bears are omnivores. They eat everything -- fruit, berries, eggs.
 "Human beings are not part of their diet."
 MEANWHILE, BACK AT HOME …
 How are domestic animals coping during COVID-19?
 Some people are seeing another side to their pets during this health crisis.
 "And vice versa," says Hannah Sotropa, a spokesman for the Toronto Humane Society.
 Does COVID-19 affect your pet?
 "If you're nervous, your dog will be, too. Your state of mind has implications for the family pet," said Sotropa.
 "Animals pick up on such subtle human cues. They are empathetic.
 "Whatever our anxieties are, animals can sense them."
 By now, Fido and Felix have become accustomed to you being home all day. Anyone preparing to go back to the office should prepare the family pet for being alone again.
 "Start now to do gradual separations to get the animal back to its old routine. Maybe go out for a walk by yourself, not always with the dog. Otherwise, when you go to work, the animal may have separation anxiety."
 The humane society is closed due to COVID-19, but Sotropa said many animals were taken into foster homes when the city had to shut down.
 "Our team of foster parents were at the ready. There are 24 animals at the shelter today and 236 in foster care."
 The annual spring kitten boom has not yet happened yet -- but when it does, Sotropa said they'll be prepared. The THS may be physically closed, but people can still adopt an animal by using the online adoption application.
 "We can still save lives and place animals, but totally remotely," said Sotropa.
 "I'm always happy to see animals going to their forever homes."
  THS receives no government funding and relies entirely on donations.
 Sotropa gave a shout-out to PureBites, a Canadian company that's donated $500,000 in cat and dog food (and treats) during this crisis -- some of which went to the THS.
