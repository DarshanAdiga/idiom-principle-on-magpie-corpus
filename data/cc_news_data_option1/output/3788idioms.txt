It’s been a rough couple of years for the WWE 2K series, with the switch port of WWE 2K18 being a nearly unplayable mess and the buggy disaster (on all platforms) that was WWE 2K20, which has led to the mainline series taking a much needed year off. In its place is WWE 2K Battlegrounds, a cartoony and arcadey take on professional wrestling where wrestlers can jump 50 feet in the air, swing opponents like rag dolls, toss them into the waiting jaws of alligators, and so on. On paper, that sounds like an exciting departure from the simulation-focused main series in favor of something more akin to 2011’s underappreciated WWE All Stars... but there’s virtually nothing beyond the flashy animations. It may be easy to pick up and play, but it lacks any sort of depth to either its combat or its roster of 70 wrestlers, a large majority of which are locked behind a microtransaction-infested barrier.

No, it isn't required — a regular, old HDMI port can deliver up to 4K and 60 FPS, which will be more than good enough for plenty of people.

There are, at the very least, a few meaningful differences between each of the five classes. Powerhouses are slow, but have attacks that can power through their opponent’s strikes; Brawlers can create weapons like steel chairs and motorcycles out of thin air and have extra power on their strikes; Technicians have extremely powerful throws and can even cause limb damage, which will cause opponents to stagger around briefly; High-Flyers can jump off the ropes, use running throws, and get to the top rope faster than other classes; and All-Arounders can do a little bit of everything. It’s similar to what WWE All Stars did with its class system, but here it’s less about defining a style of play and more about defining what specific cool things you can and can’t do.

Motor Speedway. In addition to Las Vegas, Lupton will drive the No. 17 Ford F-150 at Texas Motor Speedway on Sun., Oct. 25 and the season finale at Phoenix (Ariz.) Raceway on Fri., Nov. 6. Ten-time NGROTS veteran winning crew chief Marcus Richmond will lead Lupton’s efforts. Additionally, Lupton will return to the ARCA Menards Series and compete in its season finale at Kansas Speedway for DGR-Crosley on Fri., Oct. 16. “I am excited to return to DGR-Crosley for a few races this season,” said Lupton. “We had success together last season and I’m confident that we can build on that starting at Las Vegas and hopefully contend for wins throughout my schedule.” DGR-Crosley co-owner, David Gilliland, is looking forward to Lupton’s return. “We are happy to have Dylan back with us at DGR- Crosley for a few NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series races this year,” offered Gilliland. “We had some good races with him last year, especially at the mile-and-a-half tracks, so we’re looking forward to seeing what he can do with Marcus (Richmond, crew chief). I think they will be a solid combination and have great potential.” Lupton is no stranger to NASCAR. A NASCAR Next alumnus, Lupton has experience in all three of NASCAR’s national series levels, including four starts in the NASCAR Cup Series. The Californian also has 35 NASCAR Xfinity Series starts under his belt. A two-time winner in the ARCA Menards Series West division, Lupton had a six-race Truck Series opportunity with DGR-Crosley last year and earned one top-five and three top-10 finishes, including a career-best fifth at Kentucky Speedway and additional top-10 efforts at Chicagoland (Ill.) Speedway and Las Vegas. His sixth race of the season at Homestead-Miami (Fla.) Speedway last November was cut short after inclement weather canceled qualifying and left Lupton on the sidelines despite practicing inside the top five. “I feel like we still have some unfinished business from Homestead last year,” added Lupton. “DGR-Crosley brought me a fast truck, but unfortunately rain kept us from making the race. Hopefully, we can go to Las Vegas and finish what we started and have a successful race.” While juggling an aggressive racing schedule, Lupton, 26, also graduated in 2016 with a bachelor’s degree in Business Finance from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. A partnership announcement for Lupton at Las Vegas is forthcoming. DGR Crosley PR
