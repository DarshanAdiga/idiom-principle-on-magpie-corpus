True to form, however, Biden cast no blame on the loudest voices within his own party or the Trump-deranged media vilifying the president and his supporters as white supremacist enemies of the state at every turn. In truth, Democrats want Trump-supporting Republicans to heel, not heal, while punishing those billed as “complicit” in the president’s supposedly authoritarian regime cutting taxes and opposing Democrats’ draconian lockdowns.

As I look back, I think how this must have shaped him. The light in the canvas of his life was that he was fiercely independent. He always took care of me and my brother and taught us to be hard workers. My father and I were both readers, and he taught me to love science fiction and fantasy from a young age. When I was five, he began reading _The Hobbit_ to me every night before bed. Later on, he let me read from his own stacks of SFF paperbacks. It’s a small wonder, I suppose, that I am now a science fiction author. If he was still alive today, he’d probably be pretty proud.

“It sets the standard for this party,” said Robinson. “Being a student of history, it’s extremely exciting for me to make history. But I think when you get right down to the political side of it, to be able to make this statement for the party of freedom and equality—which is what I call the Republican Party—it lets people know that this party doesn’t have just one face. Also, it gets people who normally would not pay any attention to this party to take a look at us. And we hope to do some things that when they do take a look at us, they’ll say ‘Hey, I agree with that.’”

My father, Barry Sladen, Sr. served as a seaman from 1960-64 on board the U.S.S. John King. He was a lookout on the ships and was known for his "eagle eye". He was also an architect at heart and designed a drawing for a lookout tower on board the ship that would keep the watchmen out of the weather and be able to watch out longer as a result. The ship ended up using his design and building that lookout tower. After his service, he went on to become a builder in Scituate. He was extremely proud to have served our country and was very patriotic - taking me to parades and up until the end attending the Memorial Day parade in Cohasset just a week before he passed away. It is a generational respect that he has instilled in all of our families to have for veterans.

I don't think anyone who has been following Donald Trump's administration for the past four years can say they're surprised that he is refusing to concede defeat after the election, or that nearly all Republican elected officials are either backing him to the hilt or quivering in the corner like a bunch of cold chihuahuas. I predicted this puerile reaction some time ago, which wasn't exactly a great feat of prognostication since Trump was doing everything but running full-page ads in every newspaper in the country announcing his intentions.

I’m not trying to minimize the issues that some people have to deal with when it comes to their mental well-being, but when I think of someone with a mental disorder I’m usually picturing someone suffering from schizophrenia or some other, equally serious malady. Recognizing that there are various levels of severity for pretty much any illness, the issues highlighted in this study seem to fall toward the other end of the mental health spectrum. So people who have contracted the novel coronavirus are anxious, depressed, and have a hard time sleeping. No kidding. We’re in the middle of a pandemic, we’ve just wrapped up an incredibly contentious election, a significant portion of the country is out of work and the economy is still on the skids. On top of that, they just found another 500 murder hornets. And then you came down with the disease everyone is dreading?

Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation which oversees Welsh health boards and NHS trusts, said while the latest figures were encouraging, Wales was far from out of the woods yet.
 "Over recent weeks in NHS Wales, we have been seeing increasing numbers of coronavirus patients, and sadly that has led to a rise in people hospitalised with coronavirus and an increase in people dying," he said.
 "That is showing some signs of stabilising, but we cannot be complacent now. The public have once again worked so hard to protect our communities in Wales, and that hard work needs to continue throughout an easing of restrictions.
 "We're urging everyone in Wales to follow the restrictions so we can all hold onto the things we enjoy over the winter period. If we all work together, the NHS and social care can help those in the most need in Wales, whether they have coronavirus or other serious health conditions which need to be dealt with.
 "It is also an important time to remind people that staff across the NHS feel the impacts of coronavirus as well, if not more than anybody. If prevalence in our communities increases, there is a chance that NHS staff will have to isolate, taking vital people off our frontline where they can treat those most in need."
