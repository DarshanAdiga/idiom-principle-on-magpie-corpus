I was working for Nobody in Particular Presents then. We were an indie concert promotions company that ran three theaters: the Ogden, the Bluebird and the Gothic, but we also booked the Botanic Gardens summer concert series, Chautauqua, and plenty of shows at Red Rocks, too.


  It was sex, drugs and rock and roll. And we partied like rock stars. We rode Harleys across the stage at the Ogden in the middle of shows. I drank Lemmy under the table after a show. Back then, the UMS was held at the Bluebird, and it was all local bands. We did after-parties for Pantera at Shotgun Willie's, and A Perfect Circle held court at La Boheme.


  As hard as we all partied, when it came to working, we were the best of the best.


  Did I see some shit? Yeah. We all did.

Royal Page and his wife Clara (Colwell) Davidson and his sister Alice Davidson arrived in Avon Park via stagecoach from the Fort Meade railroad depot in 1892. The Davidsons were newlyweds. This was the start of traveling back and forth to Wisconsin.
 They first built a house on the hill overlooking Lake Lotela on the east side. A young doctor, Augustine Gandier and wife, Edna built on the south side of Lake Lotela and called their place “Hollyhurst.” It was reported that he planted many varieties of holly and hickory nut trees on the property, hence the name Hollyhurst.
 Jennie Colwell (mother of Clara Davidson) came in 1895 and had a home on North Verona Avenue. She invited Dr. Gandier to stay free at Twin Oaks any time that he was making calls in town. There were no roads at that time. One night as the doctor entered a stall to hitch a mule, he was kicked in the head. He was carried away in serious condition on a stretcher. It was Mrs. Colwell who made financial arrangements for him to enter a Baltimore hospital. As a result of Mrs. Colwell’s kindness to the doctor, Hollyhurst came into the hands of Mrs. Colwell who sold it to the Davidsons.
 The Davidsons rebuilt the house, making it into a two-story colonial mansion remodeling again in 1926 to become one of the landmarks of Avon Park. Ben Hinkley came in 1903 with his wife Allie Mae (Woodruff) and three children from Green Bay, Wisconsin. He was hired as the caretaker for Hollyhurst and the Davidson groves. The Hinkley family lived on the property.
 It was 1922 and Armistice Day was approaching. The Davidsons wanted to give a gift to the City of Avon Park. They chose the American flag with a flagpole to be installed on The Mall. The flagpole would be tall enough for the flag to be flown above the treetops. He chose a 110-foot flagpole and contracted for a base and a bronze engraved plaque. Dedication took place on Armistice Day (Veterans Day) Nov. 11, for the “Davidson Memorial,” even though he and Clara would not be able to attend.

He’s also considering the military. “Unfortunately, they always need people,” he said. “And the benefits are so good.”
 Mere months ago, the graduates of the Class of 2020 seemed all but assured of success. The economy was booming. The stock market had closed the year strong. The unemployment rate, on the decline for years, had dropped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in February. Jobs outnumbered applicants, and fears of a recession had faded.
 Then came the pandemic, shattering the economy. Last month, more than 20.5 million jobs vanished as the unemployment rate soared to 14.7% — the worst since the Great Depression. The high hopes of graduates crashed as corporations slashed budgets and rescinded offers of jobs and internships.
 For working-class students who defied the odds to get a college education, it’s hard to be optimistic about the future. There’s a sense of an unending crisis, with loans due and family members laid off.
 These graduates will be competing not just with experienced workers but with those in another Class of 2020 — high school graduates who aren’t college- bound or have put their dreams on hold to join the job hunt, in some cases to help newly unemployed parents .
 Others are opting for a two-year junior college instead of a four-year program or taking a gap year or have decided it’s not worth paying tuition for schooling that may be conducted only online.
 Some graduates have managed to find work despite the shrinking opportunities. After graduating from Morehouse, Grant Bennett will return to the high-tech firm in Silicon Valley where he interned last year.
 In California’s agricultural Central Valley, the county of Merced has six high schools with about 2,500 graduating seniors, many from low-income or immigrant families. Typically, about 40% head to college and the rest go straight to jobs in mechanics, construction, agriculture and hospitality — industries that, for now, are wiped out or stagnant.
 “The future looks very, very grim,” Merced’s assistant superintendent Constantino Aguilar said. “Where do these students go? A lot of doors have been closed. We’re trying to plan for our students’ futures and there is nothing out there for them.”
 Still, some high school grads are determined to proceed with their college plans despite the economic chaos.
 Mireya Benavides, 17, had considered a community college to save money, but instead chose the University of Texas-San Antonio. She knows it will be a financial squeeze. Her single mother, a school custodian, is the sole support for her and three siblings and was out of work part of this spring.
 Benavides hopes a work-study program — and maybe eventual scholarships and loans, along with financial help from her mother — will be enough to make ends meet. She said she’s confident something will work out. College has always been next on her agenda.
 ”If I don’t go to school, where would I be?” she asked. “Who would I become? I want to have a future. I just want to point myself in the right direction and move forward.”
 So does 22-year-old DJ Brooks, who finds himself in an uneasy limbo.

The Federal Communications Commission and Parents Television Council were understandably pleased Monday that the Supreme Court had agreed to decide whether a lower court was right to rule the FCC's indecency enforcement regime unconstitutionally vague and chilling. The National Associaton of Broadcasters said it supported a congressional review, but that broadcasters would continue to program responsibly, while Media Access Project was pleased the review was confined to indecency and not broader regulation.


  The FCC had sought the High Court hearing and PTC had argued that it was necessary if the government were going to have power to regulate indecent content on the airwaves.


  "We are pleased the Supreme Court will review the lower court rulings that blocked the FCC's broadcast indecency policy," said an spokesperson for the FCC in a statement. "We are hopeful that the Court will affirm the Commission's exercise of its statutory responsibility to protect children and families from indecent broadcast programming."


  "On behalf of families across the country, we extend our thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court for agreeing to take up broadcast decency," said PTC President Time Winter. "The High Court will have the opportunity to reverse misguided Second Circuit Court of Appeals rulings that would open the floodgates for graphic nudity and some of the harshest profanity in the English language," he said.


  The Second Circuit ruled that the FCC's indecency enforcement regime was unconditional generally and specifically as applied to an indecency finding against Fox for swearing on the Billboard awards program and for scripted nudity on NYPD Blue.


  The Justices are not expected to make a decision until spring of 2012, so he FCC's indecency enforcement authority remains pretty much in limbo."NAB supports a constitutional review of the FCC's enforcement of program content rules," said NAB spokesman Dennis Wharton. "As broadcasters, we will continue to offer programming that is reflective of the diverse communities we serve. Responsible programming decisions by network and local station executives, coupled with program blocking technologies like the V-chip and proper guidance of children by parents and caregivers, are far preferable to government regulation of program content."


  Media Access Project, which represents the Center for Creative Voices in Media and the Future of Music Coalition and had asked the court to reject the appeal on behalf of both, had expected the decision, and pointed out that accepting the appeal does not mean the court is necessarily looking to reverse the lower court.


  "It is hardly a surprise that the Supreme Court decided to hear this case," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, SVP and policy direct. "This action does not suggest that the Court is inclined to reverse the lower court's decision. The Court almost always hears appeals when a federal policy has been declared unconstitutional."


  "It is noteworthy - and encouraging - that the Court limited its review to the specific question of whether the FCC's policies violate the Constitution. Several of the broadcasters in the case had invited the Court to consider the constitutionality of the entire scheme of broadcast regulation. MAP's clients argued against this, because it is the wrong question, and the wrong case, to take up that question."

It's making the situation even more painful for the relatives of those veterans who have died from the virus.


  Robert Hopp was one of at least 79 residents of a veterans home in Paramus, New Jersey, to die from COVID-19, making the state-run facility one of the nation's worst hot spots for the virus.


  He served two and a half tours during the Vietnam War and received a Purple Heart after he was hit with enemy fire while in a helicopter. Everyone else on board the chopper died, but Hopp managed to climb into the pilot's seat and fly to safety.


  After being hospitalized recently for diabetic complications, his health deteriorated quickly and he died in April. He was 70 years old.


  His family is at a loss about how they will mark the occasion.


  "We couldn't even have a funeral for him yet," said stepson J.J. Brania-Hopp. "There's not really anything we can do right now. All we'll probably do is talk about him, maybe go for a walk out in the sun."


  The toll of the virus on military veterans has been particularly harsh. They are older, have underlying health problems, and many reside in facilities that have been breeding grounds for the disease.


  According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than 1,000 veterans have been killed by the coronavirus. That does not include hundreds more who have died in state-run veterans homes, including hard-hit facilities in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Louisiana.


  "The last couple weeks have been hard," said Neal Hebert, whose father died at a veterans home in Reserve, Louisiana. "I'm an only child and I'll routinely have the impulse of going 'Oh, I need to call Dad and tell him this thing.' And it hits me that I can't do that."


  His father, Berlin Hebert Jr., lost a leg from a land mine during the Vietnam War. He rarely talked about the war but made his son promise to never join the Army. It was only in recent years that he became more proud of his service, after the widower moved to the Southeast Louisiana Veterans home.


  It was there where he would attend Veterans Day services and he felt people acknowledged his time in the military, a gesture that moved him.


  "It always made him cry," Neal Hebert said.

I just truly pray and hope that it all blows over and everybody can get back to doing what they do best. Hopefully it's that simple. Who knows? It's been a huge wake up call. There's a lot of positives out of it too, I guess. What we're seeing around the world (like) you can see the Himalayas for the first time in 30 years and the ocean life is regenerating itself.

Heidi Olson, an ADM 2020 senior from De Soto, felt encouraged and supported with the Adopt a Senior event.
   
 "Someone adopting me was super cool," she said. "It reminded me that we were going to get through this, people were still thinking about us, and that this is a unique experience rather than something horrible and tragic like I was starting to think it was."
   
 Olson felt that getting gifts from the community was unique because it was not just family.
   
 "It also brings light to one of the days we may be sitting in the house!" she said. "It was a nice surprise!"
   
 During her senior year, Olson was involved in large group speech-readers theater. She participated in the fall play as a makeup crew member and was planning to do the same for the spring production.
   
 "It's my second year being in International Thespian Society with a leadership position as the publications manager," Olson said.
   
 She also participated in peer helpers both semesters. She hung out with kids in special education. She cooked with these students, played games, and learned life skills.
   
 "My favorite subjects were probably sociology and yearbook," Olson said. "Sociology, because it really made you think about society and how people act in a different light. It opened my eyes and made me think about how I act and how to communicate best with people or understand them."
   
 She enjoyed yearbook because it was a different approach to a class. She was able to write and use her creativity, which are things she enjoys doing.
   
 "It was kind of fun to be able to tell the story of the school year and make the book that I would look back on in a few years," Olson said. "I got to know a lot of new people through this and be involved in things I wouldn't normally be involved with."
   
 Olson shared special thoughts about her favorite teacher, Mrs. Knipper. She feels that Mrs. Knipper relates well to the students and that she was quick to respond to any emails or questions she had. Mrs. Knipper was Olson's DMACC Intro to Ed teacher.
   
 "She's always trying to go the extra mile to help us out and be there for us," Olson said. "During her explanation videos of assignments, she would dress up in onesies and costumes to lighten the mood, as well as send checkup emails, not related to school, to make sure we were all okay."
   
 When distance learning first happened, Olson was handling it well. She was able to work more, receiving larger paychecks and also do schoolwork. When school was canceled completely, Olson was upset she couldn't see her friends, she couldn't go to the gym, the mall, etc. and it became boring.
   
 "Being a senior, I looked forward to prom, graduating, seeing everyone for the last time, and cleaning out my locker," she said.
   
 After a while, she said distance learning was awful. She was trying to balance two DMACC classes, which were graded, and her regular high school classes remotely. Olson felt her DMACC courses were a lot of work and took a lot of time.
   
 Remaining motivated when school was canceled, was also a challenge for Olson.
   
 "Being at home and stuck inside all the time, all you want to do is get out," Olson said. "And school not being back in session, and being a senior, it felt really pointless and it was hard to focus."
   
 Olson acquired more of the yearbook's responsibilities as people dropped out.
   
 "Trying to get info from people was hard as well, for they felt the same, and barely got on their computer to answer emails I may have sent them," Olson said.
   
 Despite some distance learning negatives, Olson shared her favorite thing from this year. All of her friends that graduated last year, were laughing at this year's graduating senior class back in December and January because they hadn't had many snow days. As a senior, snow days don't have to be made up.
   
 "Little did they know, we got 2+ months off our senior year instead, and they got sent home from college early, which probably rained on many of their parades with them being so excited for freedom. It was a good ha ha moment!" Olson said.
   
 The Adopt a Senior event was a positive experience for Olson and her parents, Julia and Ivan Olson.
   
 "What a great idea! It gave her something to look forward to," her mother Julia said. "Waiting and wondering every day if she would get her gift and the suspense of who adopted her nearly killed her."
   
 Ashley Kuonen and family adopted Olson.
   
 "The Kuonen family used to be our next-door neighbors," Julia said. "They still live close, but a little further down the street now."
   
 Olson felt that the Adopt a Senior event Facebook page brought everyone together. She could see posts from others students that she grew up with, what gifts they got and what their future plans are.
   
 For Olson's Adopt a Senior gift, she received a yellow bath towel with a matching hand towel, which is her favorite color.
   
 "I got face masks and stick on nails, homemade sugar scrub, makeup, bath bomb, and essential oils, which is all fitting to me because I love self-care and they are all things I can use," Olson said. "I got a coloring book with inspirational quotes, a Starbucks gift card to feed my addiction, and a cute little bag that everything was put in!"
   
 She also received a heartfelt note that she said made her day.
   
 Olson is planning to attend Iowa School of Beauty and get a double license as an esthetician and a cosmetologist. She is hoping to start in July.
   
 She said, "Making the page, in general, sparked a community wide effort to help seniors out to make up for a special time in our lives!"

The National Association of Broadcasters Wednesday completed its merger with Association for Maximum Service Television, which had been the chief spectrum lobby for the broadcasting industry.
 With spectrum, how to hold on to it or get top dollar for it, a key priority for NAB, the association's board decided back in March to bring MSTV in-house. NAB said four of the five MSTV employees have joined NAB, including Victor Tawil as senior VP and Bruce Franca as VP.
 Former MSTV President David Donovan will be joining the New York State Broadcasters Association as president and exdcutive director, according to NAB.
 MSTV was launched in 1956 with the charter to "battle to insure the highest quality television reception by preventing interference on additional television channels."
 Among its credits, MSTV helped secure passage of the All-Channel Reciever Act, which required TV sets to receive UHF as well as VHF signals (before that it required a separate tuner). MSTV also was instrumental in the DTV transition, including helping convince the government early on to retain UHF channels for advanced services. That was crucial to the transition since UHF is a superior band for DTV transmissions, something broadcasters are emphasizing now as the government eyes UHF for wireless broadband.

 The NHLPA did not provide a breakdown of the vote of its 31 player representatives in making the announcement Friday night, a day after the proposal was presented to the union’s executive board. In giving the format the green light, the NHLPA stressed several details still need to be negotiated before games can begin.
 The proposal will now go to the NHL board of governors, which is expected to approve the plan in the next few days. Once approved, the proposal effectively ends the season of the league’s bottom seven teams.

“La settimana scorsa – spiegano Dulluku e Saluzzo - l’Assessore al Commercio del Comune di Imperia Gianmarco Oneglio ha convocato le Associazioni di categoria per una modifica dei posteggi dei mercati settimanali del mercoledì e del sabato ad Imperia Oneglia per adeguamento alle norme anti Covid-19 dettate dal recente Decreto governativo. Per l’adeguamento a tali norme si rende necessario ampliare le distanze tra i vari banchi espositivi, inoltre la scelta dell’Amministrazione è quella di ampliare le superfici delle singole concessioni ed evitare che la clientela stazioni tra due bancarelle, predisponendo la vendita esclusivamente sui frontali dei banchi. Queste modifiche portano necessariamente ad aumentare considerevolmente l’area mercatale. Il progetto presentato dall’assessore alle categorie commerciali prevedeva il mantenimento di un certo numero di banchi in Piazza Goito e Via Palestro, con allungamento dell’area mercatale a tutta Via Palestro, l’aggiunta di Piazza Ulisse Calvi e di Via Bonfante, compreso Piazza Bianchi relativamente al continuamento di Via Amendola.

There are so many moving parts that it’s easy to make a mistake and pay an outsized price.
 NOT GETTING GOOD ADVICE CAN BE COSTLY
 A reader recently reached out to me after getting what they thought was a coronavirus hardship withdrawal from a former employer’s 401(k). Coronavirus hardship withdrawals, authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, allow people to take up to $100,000 from their retirement plan balances without having to pay the usual 10% early withdrawal penalty. Income taxes are still owed on withdrawals, but the tax bill can be spread over three years. If you pay the money back, the taxes can be refunded.
 What this reader actually got was a regular distribution — in other words, the 401(k) was cashed out. That triggers taxes and potential penalties without the option to spread out the tax bill or pay the money back.
 A qualified financial adviser could have helped ensure that the plan offered the hardship withdrawal option (not all do), that the reader was eligible (people must be affected physically or financially by COVID-19) and that the paperwork was properly filled out.
 WHAT HELP YOU CAN EXPECT
 Consultations typically will be virtual, taking place over the phone or using videoconferencing software. All the financial advisers offering free services can help with topics such as budgeting, unemployment benefits, debt management and making the best use of CARES Act relief checks. Certified financial planners with the FPA, the NAPFA and the XY Planning Network also can advise on more specialized topics, such as the Paycheck Protection Program and other help for small businesses. Credit counselors, meanwhile, work with creditors to arrange debt payoff plans and know about available forbearance programs.
 “The options vary considerably depending on the lender you speak to, the type of loan or line of credit that you have and the circumstances that you’re dealing with,” says NFCC spokesman Bruce McClary, adding that a nonprofit credit counseling agency can help people prepare for those conversations with creditors.

WALPOLE--With schools shuttered in March through to at least June, plants growing at the Norfolk County Agricultural High School for its annual plant sale were left in limbo until the three-pronged Aggie Abundance program was formulated by staff and administrators.


  First up, the plants students had started to grow after February vacation that were slated for the annual plant sale to raise approximately $20,000 for the school each year. While groundskeeper Patrick Collins kept them going for three weeks after schools were closed in addition to his other jobs, plant science teacher Jeff Thompson and others stepped in to help when they were allowed back on campus.


  In all, 100 plants were delivered to Norwood Hospital staff, 50 plants to the Walpole Fire Department, and 50 plants to the Walpole Police Department, all on the Friday before Mother's Day as a way to thank first responders.


  "They were so appreciative," Thompson said. "It made me feel great to help them because they do so much for the community."


  Part two for the Aggie Abundance initiative is to distribute plants to school families after the school grounds are planted. While students typically would be helping with the beautification of the campus, Thompson said it is school staff that will be doing the work this time.


  "We plant the campus to the nines," Thompson said. "It really looks beautiful. If seniors do get a chance to walk and receive their diplomas, we want it to look nice for them. There's a lot of pride in our school and I think it's reflected in how it looks."


  Teacher Lisa Collins said they put in the extra effort to make the campus appealing because a large number of people from the community walk around the campus.


  "It's like a public park," Collins said. "It's kind of a shining jewel in the county."


  She said a survey was sent out to families to see who could come pick up plants and who needed a delivery.


  "Everything will already be pre-boxed so when they arrive, we put them in their trunk," Collins said. "We're very mindful of making this a safe distribution."


  For the third initiative, Thompson said the school will be planting a Covid Victory Garden instead of the usual pumpkins that are planted on 1.5 acres of land for the annual haunted hay rides.


  He said last year they received a donation of 1,500 packages of seeds from the University of Rhode Island and he has planted everything, some 10,000 plants, in the school's greenhouses.


  Peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, kale and other durable vegetables that do not require a lot of refrigeration will be grown and distributed to school families first, and then food pantries, for those who are struggling and will possibly continue to struggle with the economic fallout from the pandemic and job losses.


  "We're hoping to offset some food shortages and food insecurities," Thompson said. "The idea is, 'let's not waste any of this stuff, let's get it out to people who need it.'"


  Collins said the Covid Victory Garden will supply a free weekly Farmer's Market for Aggie families.


  "We already have staff ready to deliver to families that don't have a car," Collins said. "We don't want somebody's economic status to inhibit them from participating in the program."


  She said they will also be coordinating with the Walpole Food Pantry and Abundant Harvest to see who might be in need of what so any extra crops will not be wasted.


  Thompson said the initiative is in line with what the school was moving toward before the pandemic hit, namely the reintroduction of growing food on campus, with students running the program with staff support.


  "It they come back in September, there will be plenty for the kids to go out and pick," Thompson said.


  Thompson points to the collaboration between staff and administration as the key to bringing all the ideas to fruition and Collins agrees.


  "The Aggie is an excellent place to work even during times of quarantine," Collins said. There's a lot of good going on."

I see conflicting elements. In Italy the heaviest toll was paid by the richest regions, in the United States New York was hit the hardest compared to the Country's rural areas. Due to its specific nature, this virus affects the most interconnected, the most developed and the most globalised regions. In this respect, Africa is - so to speak - favoured. However, I believe that the most serious and worrying factor for Africa is not so much its strictly sanitary aspect (on which, for that matter, we will never have precise data), but its economic and social dimension. The world-wide industrial and business crisis will have an even greater impact on Africa. Especially in those countries and regions that live on informal economy, "street" economy, and where social protection is virtually non-existent.

In a notable example of how sports are working to use social media to more closely engage NASCAR fans, NASCAR.com has launched its first social game, the NASCAR Pro Championship presented by Sprint. The free Facebook game will be featured within Car Town, an automotive and motorsports game on Facebook that attracts about 9 million unique visitors.
 NASCAR.com is managed by Turner Sports, which has been aggressively developing digital properties for various sports, leagues and associations, including NASCAR, the NBA, and the NCAA.
 As part of that strategy, Turner has generally pushed to bundle sponsorships across both broadcast and other digital media. The NASCAR Pro Championship game will be promoted in the broadcast on TNT of NASCAR events and Sprint will be heavily integrated into the game, which will run through the conclusion of the Sprint Cup Series on November 20th.
 To launch the game NASCAR.com decided to partner with an existing game rather than build its own because of the popularity of Car Town game and close with between NASCAR fans and the auto enthusiasts that play Car Town, notes Justin Williams, senior director of business operations for NASCAR.com. Cie Games, the developer of Car Town, was also willing to work closely with an outside brand.
 Williams notes social games are very different than console games. "It is not virtual racing like a console game," he explained in an interview. "This is more about the social aspect of completing activities and gaining points and experience through the social interaction."
 Those features fit in well with NASCAR.com's overall strategy of adding activities and additional features that enhance the TV experience, Williams stresses. "It enhances the engagement with the sport when the races aren't running and hopefully it exposes some of the fun parts of NASCAR to people who may not have been exposed to it."

Lisa Morin, formerly a producer of _Oprah_ , has been named an executive producer on Warner Bros.'   upcoming _Anderson_ , the new daytime   talk show featuring Anderson Cooper. _Anderson_   will premiere in syndication on Sept. 12.


  Morin joins Jim Murphy and Cooper, who also will serve as   executive producers.


  "From the inception of this show, we knew we wanted   to have a combination of producers from various genres to create a truly   multi-dimensional show in order to capitalize on Anderson's broad range and the   variety of topics we plan to cover to distinguish it in daytime," said   Hilary Estey McLoughlin, president of Telepictures Productions, a subsidiary of   Warner Bros., in a statement. "Lisa is one of the premier producers in   talk television with a 15-year track record at _Oprah_. Her daytime talk experience perfectly complements Jim's   morning show and news experience to create a great team to lead the show."


  "Lisa is a remarkable talent and I am so happy that   she is joining our team," said Cooper, also in a statement. "We want   to create a really interesting, entertaining, and informative daytime program   and Lisa has a terrific vision for the program and the experience needed to   make it a reality."


  Morin spent the past 15 years producing _Oprah_ , most recently serving as senior   supervising producer, a position she has held since 2006. She also served as a   supervising producer from 2003 to 2006, producer from 1997 to 2003 and senior   associate producer from 1996 to 1997. Prior to joining _Oprah_ , Morin also was a producer on _The Jenny Jones Show_ from 1993 to 1996.


  Morin graduated from the University of Minnesota with a   B.A. in Business and Theater.

 "Nosotros lo que hemos es acordar con el PSOE una serie de medidas para prolongar durante quince días el estado de alarma y gracias a esa negociación hemos conseguido que el estado de alarma dure quince días, en lugar de treinta, o que julio sea un mes hábil en el Congreso", ha explicado.
 El también portavoz del Gobierno madrileño ha indicado que Ciudadanos ha logrado además que las familias que no han cobrado sus Expedientes de Regulación Temporal de Empleo (ERTE) lo vayan a hacer antes de que acabe el mes de junio o la ayuda que están recibiendo los autónomos por el cese de actividad de su negocio quede desvinculada del estado de alarma.
 El Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez todavía no ha consultado a Ciudadanos sobre una posible prórroga del estado de alarma, según Aguado, quien ha precisado que su partido no garantiza que vaya a apoyar una nueva ampliación de la declaración de alarma.
 "Siempre que esté el interés general presente, veremos qué es lo que hay que negociar y qué podemos conseguir de cara a seguir salvando vidas y seguir salvando empleos. Si hablamos de eso, perfecto, pero si lo que quiere el Gobierno de España es volver a las andadas a pactar mesas con ERC, entonces nos tendrá en contra", ha asegurado el vicepresidente madrileño.
 Otro de los compromisos que ha conseguido la formación naranja es que el Gobierno central debería aportar "un plan b" porque "no podemos estar en el estado de alarma indefinidamente", en opinión de Aguado.
 "Levantar el estado de alarma y dejar que cada comunidad autónoma haga lo que quiera no parece mejor solución", ha sostenido el portavoz del Ejecutivo madrileño, quien ha estimado que "deberíamos tener un armazón jurídico distinto al estado de alarma que permita realizar una desescalada armonizada y coherente entre todas las comunidades autónomas".

NBCUniversal's acquisition of the 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020 Olympics is a major statement from Comcast, says NBC affiliates board chairman Brian Lawlor, about the new owner's commitment to broadcast TV.
 "I see that NBC, under Comcast's ownership, is serious about its investment in the right programming to help define the brand," says Lawlor. "NBC has made a commitment to us to show marquee events live, when possible, and over the air, and lead with the highest profile events on NBC broadcast."
 Executives from NBCUniversal, ESPN and Fox ventured to Lausanne, Switzerland to bid for rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia and the 2016 Summer Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro. NBC also acquired rights to the 2018 and 2020 Games, whose sites have not been determined. The package cost $4.38 billion.
 NBC will air the 2012 Summer Olympics from London as well.
 As they've done with past Olympics, Lawlor says NBC affiliates will help foot the bill. "The infrastructure exists to help pay for the Games, as we have in the past," he says. "That will continue."
 NBC will tackle the Games without production mastermind Dick Ebersol, who resigned last month. Lawlor says NBC Sports Group Chairman Mark Lazarus is a seasoned sports producer with sterling relationships, and that the commitment of NBC Sports and Comcast to producing top-flight Olympic productions geared toward giant audiences has not wavered.
 "I always thought NBC did a great job with the Olympics, making it great family entertainment that's enjoyed by so many," said Lawlor. "We're thrilled to be able to continue with that."

I've had trouble finding who I am anyway forever and music was the only thing that made me feel like a sort of semi-normal person or something. I've been doing this since I was so young. From singing and dancing and studying that to having a little bit of experience at acting but always being a musician, that's been my heart and soul. Going into different sort of bands - pop bands to rock bands, to acoustic outfits and then to Australian Idol - it was the path to fulfilment. It wasn't the overall fulfilment. I was still learning the ropes. I was still in my apprenticeship days. Now this is me coming of age as a man. I guess looking back, although one of my songs is called Don't Look Back and I'm going to break the rules there, everything that I've experienced is all in this music. All the stories and things have come from different places of life; growing up and being famous, and then not being famous, and then changing my name to Buffalo Tales and realising that wasn't really the answer either, and then I did a dance thing and toured with a DJ. This is a coming back home and using all of that live experience to reignite the flame that is me as a musician and as an artist. This is truly who I am, more so than trying to fit into somebody else's a square peg in a round hole.

Im wichtigeren Dollar-Preis indes hielt die runde Marke von 1700 Dollar, obwohl der Preis sich von seinem jüngsten Hoch bei 1765 Dollar wieder merklich entfernt hat. Solange diese Marke hält, sieht Commerzbank-Rohstoffexperte Carsten Fritsch auch keine Gefahr für den Preis.
 „Wir erachten dies als Konsolidierung nach den starken Anstiegen in den letzten Wochen. Gold hatte genau vor einer Woche ein Siebeneinhalb-Jahreshoch markiert, Silber war im Zuge dessen ebenfalls kräftig gestiegen. Solange Gold sich über der Marke von 1.700 USD behauptet, stellt dies unseres Erachtens nach lediglich eine kurze Verschnaufpause im intakten Aufwärtstrend dar“, schrieb Fritsch in einem aktuellen Kommentar.

Just months ago, he thought he’d be welcoming family for a June graduation celebration at Carleton College in Minnesota as the first in his family to earn a degree. He’d worked two jobs while in school, helping his mother pay her bills. He figured he would have a job lined up, likely as a counselor, having earned a psychology degree.
 Instead, he’s navigating what he calls a “sea of unexpectedness,” sending out resumes at a time of furloughs and hiring freezes. He’ll probably return to Chicago to live with his mother.
 ”I don’t have a backup plan,” he said. “I had higher hopes.”
 It took just a few weeks for the pandemic to derail Tariq Murphy’s future.
 In December and January, the Morehouse College senior was flying high, interviewing for internships. In March, it all fell apart.
 The school was forced to close and Murphy, a marketing major, had no place to live. Morehouse put him and about 30 other students up in a hotel. He’s now plotting his next steps, with $88,000 in debt hanging over him.
 ”I can’t sugarcoat the fear,” the 28-year-old New Jersey native said. “I’m someone who likes to have a plan. It’s sometimes hard to sleep. I said to my dean it’s like a nightmare that never ends.”
 Some graduates have managed to find work despite the shrinking opportunities. After graduating from Morehouse, Grant Bennett will return to the high-tech firm in Silicon Valley where he interned last year.
 “I kind of have survivor’s guilt,” he said. “I see a lot of friends struggling and I feel very cozy knowing I have something.”
 He’s definitely one of the lucky ones. Historically, college graduates entering the work force during a recession have faced setbacks that can last a decade or longer.
 It’s a “frightening” time to be looking for a first job, said Jesse Rothstein, a senior economist in the Obama administration who teaches public policy and economics at Berkeley. “If you don’t get a good job when you start out, it hurts you not just now but for years to come.”
 In the short term, young graduates are more likely to be unemployed or settle for lower-paying work. They often miss out on valuable training that can set them on a career path and, once the economy recovers, they have permanently lower employment and earnings, Rothstein found in a study published last year on the impact of the 2008 recession on college grads.
 Whether the Class of 2020 will face long-term setbacks depends on the severity of the recession and the speed of economic recovery, he said. The longer it lasts, the worse the damage.
 As he struggles to find work, Tyler Lyson is considering leaving Berkeley to move back home to Post Falls, Idaho, where it’s cheaper, even though it would feel like giving up on his dreams.
 As a teen, he watched his family lose everything in the recession. His father’s construction business collapsed and the family had to leave their foreclosed house so quickly that they dumped just about everything they owned into a pit and set it on fire.
 ”I watched it all go up in smoke — everything we owned,” Lyson said. “Ever since then, I knew I needed to go to college and have something to fall back on.”

As the novel coronavirus sweeps across the United States, it appears to be infecting and killing black Americans at a disproportionately high rate, according to a Washington Post analysis of early data from jurisdictions across the country. The emerging stark racial disparity led the surgeon general Tuesday to acknowledge in personal terms the increased risk for African Americans amid growing demands that public-health officials release more data on the race of those who are sick, hospitalized and dying of a contagion that has killed more than 12,000 people in the United States. A Post analysis of what data is available and census demographics shows that counties that are majority-black have three times the rate of infections and almost six times the rate of deaths as counties where white residents are in the majority.

But they’d hatched another plan.
 Darshana, the 30-year-old owner of a small retail shop, and Pawani, 25, a lab assistant at a state-run school, decided to share their wedding day with some of their neediest neighbors.
 After registering the marriage with a few close family and friends, the couple cut the wedding cake and fed each other a piece before getting to work.
 The groom wore a dark blue, three-piece, Western-style suit with an ivory tie and boutonniere, and the bride was in a white lace sari and a jeweled wedding headpiece with pink and purple flowers pinned above her chignon.
 Both wore masks as they delivered plastic bags of goods to each home, some built of uneven wooden planks on mud floors. Little girls and their mothers beamed at the bride as she distributed colorful plastic headbands; they offered the couple blessings for a happy married life.
 Darshana and Pawani presented children with toy cars. They even offered slices of their cake. Then, they applied hand sanitizer and moved on to the next home.
 They have since received a flood of phone calls and visits at their home and shop from strangers who praised them for their generosity.
 “By doing this, we got a great satisfaction,” Darshana said. “When you see the happiness on the face of these people, especially the kids ... you see .... I don’t have words to explain that happiness.”

“Everything from elementary schools to universities is closing down and there’s no saying how it’s going to go when the fall semester opens,” said Gozikowski, adding that he’s hoping schools start opening up for spring semester. “This is like a safety net. I have a source of income and I’ll be able to continue working.”
 Gozikowski, who is from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and is serving at Fort Hood, Texas, is one of hundreds of service members who are taking advantage of newly developed, short-term extensions being offered by the military.
 As of last week, the Army had already exceeded its retention goal of 50,000 soldiers for the fiscal year ending in September, re-enlisting more than 52,000 so far. And the other services have also met or are closer than planned to their target numbers. The influx of people re-enlisting will offset any shortfalls in recruiting, which has been hampered by the outbreak. And that will help the services meet their total required troop levels for the end of the year.
 “We’re hiring,” said Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. “Like anything, market dynamics come into effect and people will see where the opportunities lie.”
 Sgt. Maj. Stuart Morgan, the senior Army career counselor, said Gozikowski was able to take advantage of a new program designed to help soldiers who were planning to leave this year but are now worried and reconsidering their options. The program allows them to delay their departure for up to 11 months to get them past the peak coronavirus period. By early last week, he said, 745 soldiers had signed up.
 “What we’re seeing this year, which is directly related to COVID, is we do have a population of soldiers that what they were expecting at the end of transition has suddenly disappeared,” Morgan said. “And now you have a soldier that is trying to go through a transition period that is now facing uncertainty on the outside.”
 The Air Force is already expecting to fall short of its recruiting goal by as much as 5,800 as a result of the virus. And that gap, the Air Force said, could be filled by service members who decide to re-enlist or extend their service.
 So far, the number of Air Force personnel who have withdrawn their requests to leave the service or have asked to extend their enlistment is 700 more than last year at this time, including 230 pilots and medical staff.

I was working a Neko Case concert when a chick in a bathroom stall OD'd. Another time, a guy at a Linkin Park show at the Coliseum fell out of the balcony right in front of me. And then there was the infamous Damageplan show in Colorado Springs where a chick in the pit took a nosedive onto the blacktop. It's all fun and games...until somebody gets hurt. We had to deal with any curveball that came along.


  I was working an Allman Brothers show when tour manager Burt Holman told me my head was up my ass. Of course, I lost my shit plenty of times on my production guys. It was hard and thankless work. And definitely for the thick- skinned.


  But the moment I was backstage at Red Rocks -- some show almost over -- and I looked up into the crowd, my heart nearly stopped. It was the most beautiful thing a person could see. And in that exact moment, I knew that all our blood, sweat and tears meant something to every person there...even if they didn't know it.


  It was the '90s, and I was living the dream, doing shows every night. Rock and roll was paying my bills.


  But good things don't always last. NIPP became embattled in a lawsuit with Clear Channel and then started to downsize. The corporate giants swept into our cool little city, and eventually the theaters that NIPP controlled were leased to AEG.


  In the downsizing, Jim Norris, Jeff Campbell and Marty Killorin lost their jobs. Together, they decided to try to start their very own punk rock shithole, and they called it 3 Kings Tavern.


  Marty, Jeff and Jim pulled together cash to launch at 60 South Broadway and immediately started putting up galvanized steel and painting the walls red. A few months later, I found myself at the opening. They were so proud of that shithole. And you know what? So was I.


  At 3 Kings, we, the misfits of Denver, celebrated our lives.

Its request does not ask Robart to rule on that motion before he sees what steps the city plans to take to address his concerns about police accountability. Nor does it repeat the city's past position that police accountability falls outside the four corners of the consent decree. The judge has disagreed, calling accountability crucial to public confidence in the reform process.


  Last May, Robart cited deficiencies in the disciplinary appeals process, as well as artificial time limits on internal investigations that have allowed officers to avoid discipline and a lack of subpoena power for internal affairs investigators, as reasons for his finding that the city was partly out of compliance.


  The city, in its filing, said it already has taken "significant steps" that it will provide to the court. Negotiations behind closed doors are to begin this year on a new contract with SPOG, which signaled it will aggressively fight to protect its rights when it recently elected a new, hardline president.


  If the city's motion leads to the lifting of the consent decree anytime in the near future, the court's leverage over the city would vanish as it negotiates with the union over police accountability and discipline.


  The Community Police Commission (CPC), a citizen advisory body created as part of the consent decree, opposed the current contract between the city and SPOG, saying it weakened hard-fought reform efforts. It plans to reveal its position on the city's motion in a court filing this week.


  State law requires the city to engage in collective bargaining with the union. And Durkan, who has made organized labor a key part of her political base, so far has shown no inclination to fundamentally alter the city's relationship with SPOG.


  If Robart were to rule that provisions of the city's contract with the union were unconstitutional, it would set the stage for a prolonged, bloody court battle that would draw in labor supporters and those, including some union members, who believe police unions don't represent their values.

Bad movies happen. There are big budget flops, like last year’s “Cats,” and movies so ridiculous they become entertaining, like Kevin Costner’s “Waterworld,” or cult favorites, like “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” The 1974 British comedy “Ghost in the Noonday Sun” never got to be any of those things, because the studio refused to release it.
 On paper, “Ghost in the Noonday Sun” sounded promising. The bumbling pirate comedy starred Peter Sellers, one of the top comedy actors of the time, following repeated stints as clueless detective Clouseau in the Pink Panther series and his array of roles in “Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb." Spike Milligan was hired to write the screenplay, and following the success of recent films, including “The Ruling Class,” Hungarian-born Peter Medak was hired to direct. The project quickly drew studio funding.
 Medak says when the dilapidated cargo ship they remodeled as a three-masted pirate vessel arrived in port in Cypress, where they filmed for two months, it ran aground and had to be repaired. Almost everything that followed also went wrong.

Netflix last week pulled Sony Pictures Entertainment movies from its Internet- streaming video-on-demand service, citing a "temporary contract issue" between Sony and Starz for the suspension.
 "[W]hile these two valued partners work through their differences, we hope you are enjoying the wide variety of new movies and TV shows added daily," Netflix vice president of content acquisition Pauline Fischer wrote in a post on the Netflix corporate blog last Friday.
 Starz and Sony Pictures Entertainment did not immediately comment on the Netflix post.
 Starz and Netflix are in the midst of renegotiating a content-distribution deal, with their original three-year pact set to expire in the first quarter of 2012.
 Meanwhile, Starz this spring said it would begin withholding original series from the Netflix streaming queue until 90 days after they debut on the TV network, with first-run movies to follow suit later.
 Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has suggested the Starz renewal could cost $200 million to $300 million per year, up from an estimated $30 million annually under the original agreement.
 Last year Netflix struck a deal worth $1 billion over five years with Epix, the joint venture of Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

As part of its ongoing international expansion, NATPE has acquired the Budapest-based content market DISCOP East, which will take place on June 21st to 23rd this year. As a result of the deal, the event will be rebranded as NATPE/BUDAPEST for the June 2012 iteration.
 NATPE reports that it will take over full organizational and managerial responsibilities for the market and run it as a companion to its highly successful Miami-based international content market, which takes place in January. The Latin American program distributors who are a big part of the Miami market are also major program sellers in Eastern Europe, where telenovelas have become extremely popular prime time fare.
 Looking forward, NATPE will continue to partner with DISCOP organizers Basic Lead on regional events DISCOP Africa (scheduled for September 7th to 9th, 2011) and DISCOP Istanbul (February 28th to March 1st, 2012).
 Patrick Jucaud, general manager of Basic Lead, will continue to oversee those markets and work with NATPE as the market moves towards the 2012 event.
 In a statement, Jucaud noted that the deal will allow DISCOP East to expand "into a truly globally focused market" and that the "new arrangement also gives us the means to expand our events in strategic regions such as Africa, the broader Middle East and Central Asia."
 Rick Feldman, president and CEO, NATPE called the deal "the next step in the evolution of our relationship" and noted in a statement that the acquisition of DISCOP East was part of NATPE's "strategy to enhance the value of NATPE in financial terms and our ability to serve our clients in growing international markets."
 Feldman also noted that "the organization of two major global content markets in January and June will allow us to have a more consistent relationship with our clients throughout the year. We will continue to develop our partnership with Patrick in Africa, the broader Middle East and Central Asia and will benefit from his guidance as DISCOP East is transferred over to NATPE in preparation for June 2012."

 “If I sing something (while marching) and people are feeling it, I might repeat it,” Bougere says. “This is totally different. We said let’s start telling stories. There are stories in our chants, but this takes you down the road.”
 The song “Culture Vulture” has several lines repeated like chants about people asking Indians to pose for pictures. But the lyrics also describe people putting those photos in books or applying for grants to study Mardi Gras Indians without sharing profits or giving back to the Indians when the project is about their work.
 "Stop the Water” echoes the sounds of traditional Indian songs, but adds background vocals including gospel-like parts. The lyrics describe Hurricane Katrina hitting the city and citizens escaping flooding in the following days.
 Bourgere and Bossier grew up in Mardi Gras Indian families. In 2003, Bougere took over the tribe founded by his father Rudy Bougere, the 9th Ward Hunters. Bossier’s uncle was Big Chief of the Black Eagles. Bossier became the Spy Boy for the Yellow Pocahontas, later joined Trouble Nation and then founded his own group, 7th Ward Creole Hunters. They also were drawn to music and as chiefs became known for singing. Now they’re making their mark on Mardi Gras Indian music.
 “That’s what the Wild Tchoupitoulas did,” Bossier says. “That’s what Monk (Boudreaux) did, what Juan Pardo did. Now we’re updating the music.”

Several days later during a Charlotte-area visit, a top Trump administration health official sounded less certain. Asked about preparations to safely host the RNC, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said increasing testing capacity is important. However, he did not refer to a traditional in-person convention as a certainty, but rather noted that “we’re several months away from the possibility of the RNC.” Azar also praised Cooper's moves to reopen the state.

Memorial Day weekend may have been the apex of Mantle’s 1956 season. The Yankees faced the hapless Washington Senators, “first in war, first in peace and last in the American League,” to cite the phrase baseball writer and humorist Charles Dryden coined about the perennial cellar dwellers.
 Better yet for Mantle, the Senators’ first game pitcher was Pedro Ramos, nicknamed the “Cuban Cowboy” because of his fascination with the Lone Ranger movies and his propensity for 10-gallon hats.
 Mantle feasted off of Ramos’ pitching. In game one of the May 30 double header, Mantle hit a 620-foot blast that came within 18 inches of clearing the distant right field Yankee Stadium facade. In the nightcap, Mantle launched a 475-foot homer off Ramos’ Cuban compatriot, Camilo Pascual. By the time the seven hour-long afternoon had ended, Mantle led the league in six offensive categories.
 For Pascual, Ramos and Mantle, their post-baseball lives were a mixed bag. Pascual, age 86, lived the least controversial life of the three Memorial Day protagonists. After he retired from the active playing roster, Pascual remained involved in big league baseball for five decades. Pascual served as the Minnesota Twins’ pitching coach before he became an international scout for the Oakland A’s, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets.

The team across the borough say that they are fortunate that the council already provides its services through what it calls a ‘place-based model’.


  It meant that managers coordinating the support effort already understand the profile of each area - the kind of services it needs and the local support networks that are already available.


  Lin Hogan is a manager at Leigh’s hub, with its two dozen or so staff working out of Leigh’s library.


  She says the support from businesses has been particularly heartening.


  In the first few weeks of the pandemic - what now feels like a lifetime ago - supermarket stockpiling led to a food supply issue for those who needed it most.


  “People were stockpiling and the really vulnerable people couldn’t get the supermarket slots,” Lin remembers.


  It was then that Morrisons came forward with a doorstep delivery, she says, while local suppliers - farm shops and businesses - also came on board to help out.


  As we enter the third month in lockdown, access to food has remained the biggest concern for residents. Coordinating the food parcels makes up a large chunk of the hubs’ work.
