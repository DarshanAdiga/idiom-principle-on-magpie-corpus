“On June 6, 2020, through a series of serendipitous events, I inherited the keys to a vacant commercial lot in Crown Heights. With the help of friends, neighborhood folk, and artists alike, what was once a methadone clinic, laundromat, and pawn shop has since taken on a new and less tangible shape.We’ve covered the walls in murals, coaxed garden out of gravel, and found an oasis. There, for 85 days, we’ve researched, designed, and fabricated together, across various personal and collective projects, all in the spirit of resistance and radical joy. As I watched this living, breathing entity turn into itself and back out into the world, I remembered the name of my then- defunct finsta… Pubilic Assistants, an abolitionist space, an LGBTQIA+ brave space, a pro-trans space, an anti-racist space. I thought I was going to ground this introduction in the subject of genocide, because that’s all that’s ever on my mind. This was going to be about my disdain for Manifest Destiny as an enacted concept and equivalency to white supremacy. This was going to be about John Gast’s allegorical painting ‘American Progress,’ as it appears across our middle school textbooks: revered in its depiction of white settlers chasing indigenous peoples west and out of the picture. I meant to touch on global, historical colorism and patriarchy as the foundations for all systems of oppression and disenfranchisement, like that André 3000 jumpsuit that reads, ‘across cultures, darker people suffer most. why?’ I wanted to really slice into the inextricable and intersectional layers of our collective and global depravity. That said, as my thoughts began to jumble, I had a series of personal realizations and I started making phone calls, the results of which you’ll see in the following pages.”

A declining share of Americans say they would receive the first coronavirus vaccine, according to a new survey, and most expect someone else to completely or partially foot the bill.
 Just 39% of respondents to the most recent Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index poll say they are likely to get the first-generation COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it’s available, a nine-percentage point drop from a poll conducted Aug. 21 to Aug. 24. Six in 10 in the most recent poll say they’re not likely to take the first vaccine, up from 51% in the August poll.

Meanwhile, 38% of respondents say their health insurance will completely cover the cost, and 11% say the same of the federal government. Another 9% said their health insurance would partially cover the cost and they would pay some out of pocket, and 4% expected to pay completely out of pocket for the vaccine. (Some 21% indicated they wouldn’t get the vaccine, and 16% answered the question with “don’t know.”)
 How much money would people be willing to pay out of pocket? For a third of respondents, the answer was “nothing.” Another 26% said they would be willing to pay less than $20, while 25% said $20 to less than $50, and 10% said they would pay $50 to less than $100. Just 5% said they would be willing to shell out $100 or more.
 The nationally representative poll, conducted Sept. 18 to Sept. 21, included responses from 1,008 U.S. adults.
 The Trump administration’s “Operation Warp Speed” program includes “the goal of no upfront costs to providers and no out-of-pocket cost to the vaccine recipient,” according to a distribution-strategy report published last week by the Health and Human Services and Defense Departments.
 “Various plans, supported by the CARES Act and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, are under development with the objective of ensuring no one will be charged any out–of-pocket expenses for the administration of the vaccine either,” the document says. “The objective is to ensure no one desiring vaccination will face an economic barrier to receiving one.”
 While the CARES Act provides for free COVID-19 vaccine coverage, Medicare beneficiaries — 15% of the country’s population — could wind up paying out of pocket if a vaccine is approved under a less-stringent emergency-use authorization rather than full Food and Drug Administration approval, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.
 A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesperson told MarketWatch the administration was committed to modernizing Medicare to ensure access to a vaccine with no cost sharing. The White House and HHS didn’t immediately return requests for comment.

The Hurricane-to-be was one of the only effective parts of Edgewater’s defense against IMG and gave McCarthy fits at times, particularly in the first half. Troutman looks much better than his current 5.5 ranking, as he breaks on the ball incredibly well and changes directions a lot quicker than he once did.

A High Court judge has said a “lead” case on Leaving Cert grades will be heard next month – but only if lawyers agree which of three separate cases brought over standardisation will be that lead case. One of the cases is by Freddy Sherry, a Leaving Cert student at Dublin&rsquo;s Belvedere College. He claims the Minister for Education&rsquo;s &ldquo;interference&rdquo; last August with the work of the Independent Steering Committee on Calculated Grades, directing it not to rely on previous school data or schools historic records in the standardisation process, led to him being unfairly downgraded by 55 points in his Leaving Cert this year.A second case is by the Board of Management of St Kilian&rsquo;s German school in Dublin and eight of its students, who claim the standardisation model lead to an &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; downgrading of results in German and other subjects there.Aine Finnegan, from Fairview in Dublin, claims in the third action the standardisation process meant she unfairly missed out on a place in Medicine in Trinity College Dublin by two points.When all three cases were mentioned before Mr Justice Charles Meenan, he was asked to fix a hearing date in late October.The judge said an October hearing date was entirely dependent on a lead case being identified. Unless the sides reached agreement by next week on which of the cases should be a lead case, he would not fix a hearing date in this law term, which runs to December 21, he stressed.Brian Kennedy SC, for the Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister for Further and Higher Education and the State, earlier said the cases involved a &ldquo;systemic&rdquo; challenge to the calculated grades process and his side would need at least four weeks to prepare opposition papers.Feichin McDonagh SC, with Micheál P O&rsquo;Higgins SC and Brendan Hennessy BL, for the applicants, said the cases were not a systemic attack on the calculated grades.Instead, they argued, the cases concerned a Ministerial decision last August to &ldquo;interfere&rdquo; in that process in response to some criticism in public discourse.In the case by Mr Sherry, of Newtown, Celbridge, Co Kildare, he said, while Belvedere College does not have &ldquo;formal streaming&rdquo; of classes, he says he was in the &ldquo;faster moving&rdquo; Leaving Cert classes in four subjects as well as being in the only class in Latin, and, as a result, expected the students in most of his classes would have had a high number of H1 and H2 grades.He had studied consistently for his Leaving Cert until May 8 when the cancellation of the exam and its replacement with a calculated grades system was announced.He had relied on the respondents guidelines published on May 20 for students and schools.But contrary to the express representations by the respondents, the process has not relied on previous school data or historical data on a national level during the standardisation process and that was announced by the Minister at a press conference on September 1.He was &ldquo;hugely disappointed&rdquo; his teachers&rsquo; estimated CAO points total of 542 for him was reduced to 487 under the process.His first course choice was pharmacy in TCD, he had decided not to take up a CAO offer of Chemical Sciences with Medicinal Chemistry in the Technical University of Dublin and may now may have to sit the Leaving Cert exam in November.In the St Kilian&rsquo;s case, it is claimed the school consistently achieves a high number of H1s and H2s in Leaving Certificate German.It is &ldquo;impossible to reconcile&rdquo; that background with the Calculated Grades actually received by students of St Kilian&rsquo;s, its principal Alice Lynch said in an affidavit.One student had had the school&rsquo;s estimated mark of 90pc for her reduced to a H3 while another student was downgraded from a H2 to H4 and was refused a CAO place since he did not have the H3 German requirement for the course in TCD.The calculated grade system was &ldquo;inherently flawed&rdquo; and failed to take into account the proven level of German academic attainment for the students in the school.In her action, Ms Finnegan also alleges unfairness in the process. She studied for her Leaving Cert at the fee-paying Institute of Education in Dublin, missed out on a place in Medicine at TCD by two points after three of her calculated grades were reduced.Joe Jeffers BL, for TCD, told the court the college could not give an assurance, as sought by her lawyers, to hold a place for her on the course pending the outcome of her action. Mr McDonagh said his side would correspond with TCD about that matter.Earlier a fourth case, by Martha Woods, who got 613 points in the 2019 Leaving Certificate, was withdrawn.Ms Woods, Murragh, Enniskeane, Co Cork, had said the points for dentistry in UCC rose this year from 590 points to 613, the final applicants for that course all had 613 points, places were allocated by random selection and she failed to get a place. Because she has since got a place in the UCC Dentistry course, that case is not proceeding.

What happened in New York easily could preview the general election. NPR notes that more than 23,000 absentee ballots were rejected in Wisconsin’s primary this year, exceeding Trump’s margin in the state in 2016. Nearly 40,000 were rejected in Pennsylvania, where Trump won by 44,000 votes in 2016.
 In light of all this, it makes sense, first and foremost, to try to make more options available for in-person voting.
 In addition, states should allow the counting of mail-in ballots prior to Election Day to minimize any swing in the count afterward. Congress should delay the date that states have to finalize their results, currently Dec. 8. And election officials and the parties should do everything they can to educate mail-in voters to do it correctly.
 What should be intolerable is any attempt to change the rules after the fact, although it’s entirely conceivable that Democrats will feel compelled after Nov. 3 to argue that the mail-in voting that they’ve done so much to promote is desperately flawed and deeply unjust.

Griffin moved incredibly well for a guy who stands every bit of 6-foot-5. He could help any number of schools at defensive end as he adds muscle. He may not be a top-flight prospect, but he certainly wouldn’t look out of place on a lot of Group of Five rosters.

With smaller gatherings on the cards in response to a new spike in coronavirus cases in the UK, farmers are bracing themselves for householders wanting to rein in their annual festivities with smaller birds. With turkey poults already bought and being fattened, they are looking at ways to cater for the new realities, following prime minister Boris Johnson's warning of a long haul back to normality. MORE - Fruit firm snaps up neighbouring strawberry-growing businessDay-old poults arrive on farms in June to August so they can be reared in time for Christmas. There are some smaller breeds but producers will have to work with what they have - and the birds tend to grow quite large within a range of weights. One north Suffolk producer is looking at promoting 'crowns' - where legs and thighs are removed to create a smaller roast - for customers worried they may be taking on more than they can chew. Meanwhile, one Essex farmer is planning to trial 'half turkeys', having successfully done so for geese. But producers - including premium turkey supremo Paul Kelly of Kelly Turkeys - will also be promoting the "good value" represented by a large bird. "If only six sit down for dinner, then around four servings are available for meals over the weekend. Big, wholesome pies are the answer," said Paul. And with the usual festive exodus of around £4m to £5m UK citizens heading to warmer climes now curtailed by the crisis and an exceptionally long Christmas weekend as Christmas Day falls on Friday this year, producers are hoping that big turkeys may still be in big demand as householders batten down at home. Chris Mobbs of traditional turkey producers PA Mobbs of Cratfield, near Halesworth, is rearing around 3,500 turkeys for the festive season. With butchers enjoying exceptionally good business this year because of lockdown and a heightened awareness of local food, he is hopeful big turkeys will still sell well among domestic consumers. However, he is concerned about some of his business customers. Many of these have been buying large quantities of his birds as a festive treat for their employees for decades - but with a downturn on the cards, that market will be unpredictable. Catering customers have picked up considerably since lockdown eased and provided hospitality venues stay open, he hopes their custom will continue. "We are all going into the unknown really," he said. "Obviously we are expecting there to be a lot more small turkeys sold." But with these available in limited numbers, the larger birds will be the only option, he said. However, back in spring as the crisis unfolded, he - like many other producers - cut back on turkey numbers this season. This is likely to mean fewer birds available - which may boost demand. Chris is already fielding sales inquiries but is unsure whether they have been prompted by Boris Johnson's latest announcement on coronavirus or a change in the weather. His other headache this year will be availability of seasonal labour. Chris employs a Latvian couple all year round and around eight or nine Latvian workers are already booked on flights to join them in the run-up to Christmas when - with luck - the orders will come flooding in. The question will be whether there is a tightening of travel restrictions in November. Howard Blackwell - who owns the Rare Breed Meat Company in Coggeshall, north Essex, which he runs with son George - faces similar worries about labour in the run- up to the festive season. They rely on about half a dozen Polish seasonal workers to supplement their local workforce in the weeks before the big day. The Blackwells are rearing around 5,500 birds, and employ around 40 to 45 staff across farm shop and butchery business, and have taken on around five or six extra staff this year in response to higher demand for their range of chicken, geese, beef, lamb, pork, goat and game products. These are sold locally and into high-end London-based restaurants and catering businesses. He's still struggling to keep up with demand, he said. "Since they've opened up they've been mega-busy - we have had a job to keep up with it," he admitted. It hasn't all been plain sailing. After lockdown, he faced big losses from restaurants and other customers who were unable to pay or went bust. But he hopes that Christmas will provide a boost. "I think it's going to be good. I don't think people are going to be going to restaurants and hotels and getting an inferior product that's imported. People aren't going to be away on holiday," he said. "There's definitely been more of a swing towards small butchers because we supply small butchers in London and trade is up 20%." The company already produces half turkeys for tastings so this may well be the answer for some customers seeking smaller portions this year, he believes.
