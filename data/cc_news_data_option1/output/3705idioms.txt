GLIDE — When John and Tina Cyphert purchased their manufactured home for their plot of property on Lone Rock Road, John insisted on the home having a metal roof.
 “It’s a good thing we did,” Tina said. “The ash just boiled over the top of our house for hours.”
 The Cypherts bought one of the last available lots on the eastern end of Lone Rock Road, and their home was installed in May. As the Archie Creek Fire raced down the North Umpqua River and closed in on homes in the area, an evacuated Tina Cyphert was left to rely on social media and her surveillance camera for updates.

That minister's successor - who held the post for less than a month - resigned in the face of the president's promotion of the anti- malarial drugs as a solution to COVID-19. Upon assuming the interim position, Pazuello backed the drug's nationwide prescription and officially added its distribution by the ministry as part of Brazil's anti-virus measures.

Historically, Californians have a spotty track record of mitigating their wildfire risks on a large scale, and with few exceptions, local governments have done a poor job of enforcing the standards that already exist. Both consumers and local governments will have a role in seeing the proposed regulations bear fruit after statewide mitigation standards are set.
 “We’re incentivizing the consumer and incentivizing the local community to bring down the risk and keeping the insurance market vibrant where they’re competing for people’s businesses,” Lara said.
 One insurance group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Assn., which represents about 60% of the property casualty insurance market, welcomed the upcoming hearing as an opportunity to revisit the rate-making process overall. Insurers have complained that California’s laws don’t allow them to price in the increasing risks linked to climate change because they can set rates based only on past losses.
 “APCIA applauds the commissioner’s interest in improving the regulatory system to encourage more insurers to write insurance in high-risk wildfire areas and give consumer more choices,” the group said in a statement. “Clearly, California is facing dramatically different conditions with five of the state’s largest fires occurring just this year. Climate change is altering conditions in California and we expect this to be the ‘new normal.’”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Israel on Tuesday signed historic diplomatic pacts with two Gulf Arab states at a White House ceremony that President Donald Trump declared will mark the “dawn of a new Middle East,” casting himself as an international peacemaker at the height of his reelection campaign.
 The bilateral agreements formalize the normalization of Israel’s already thawing relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in line with their common opposition to Iran.
 But the agreements do not address the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, who view the pacts as a stab in the back from their fellow Arabs and a betrayal of their cause for a Palestinian state.
 Hundreds of people massed on the sun-washed South Lawn to witness the signing of agreements in a festive atmosphere little marked by the coronavirus pandemic. Attendees did not practice social distancing and most guests didn’t wear masks.
 “We’re here this afternoon to change the course of history,” Trump said from a balcony overlooking the South Lawn. “After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East.”
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the day “is a pivot of history. It heralds a new dawn of peace.”
 Neither Netanyahu nor Trump mentioned the Palestinians in their remarks, but both the UAE and Bahraini foreign ministers spoke of the importance of creating a Palestinian state.
 Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the brother of Abu Dhabi’s powerful crown prince, even thanked Netanyahu for “halting the annexation” of West Bank land claimed by the Palestinians in exchange for Emirati recognition. Netanyahu, however, has insisted that Israel has only suspended its plans to annex West Bank settlements.
 “Today, we are already witnessing a change in the heart of the Middle East — a change that will send hope around the world,” al-Nahyan said.
 Bahrani Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani said Bahrain would stand with the Palestinians. “Today is a truly historic occasion,” he said. “A moment for hope and opportunity.”
 But in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian militants fired two rockets into Israe l, apparently meant to coincide with the ceremony. The Israeli military said the rockets were fired from Gaza and one was intercepted by air defenses. Earlier in the day, Palestinian activists held small demonstrations in the West Bank and in Gaza, where they trampled and set fire to pictures of Trump, Netanyahu and the leaders of the UAE and Bahrain.
 Israel and the U.S. hope the agreements can usher in a major shift in the region should other Arab nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, follow suit. That could have implications for Iran, Syria and Lebanon. Until now, Israel has had peace deals only with Egypt and Jordan.
 Other Arab countries believed to be close to recognizing Israel include Oman, Sudan and Morocco.
 “We are very down the road with about five different countries,” Trump told reporters before the ceremony.
 Many longtime Mideast analysts and former officials, among others, have expressed doubts about the impact of the signings.
 In addition to the bilateral agreements signed by Israel, the UAE and Bahrain, all three signed a document dubbed the “Abraham Accords” after the patriarch of the world’s three major monotheistic religions.
 The “Abraham Accords” and the bilateral agreement signed by Israel and Bahrain fell short of more detailed formal treaties that are the diplomatic norm. Both documents were made up of general statements pledging to advance diplomacy, mutual cooperation and regional peace.
 The most detailed of the agreements was the one between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. The nations agreed to approve bilateral agreements on 15 areas of mutual interest, including finance, trade, aviation, energy, telecommunications, health, agriculture and water.
 During the signing ceremony, the leaders were seated at a long table where President Harry S. Truman once held weekly luncheon meetings with his Cabinet. Discussions about the Truman Doctrine to restrain Soviet expansion during the Cold War and the Marshall Plan to send billions in economic aid to Western Europe after World War II were held at the table.
 The stagecraft, including live music and flags was meant to evoke previous Middle East agreements. Trump’s political backers are looking to boost his standing as a statesman with just seven weeks to go before Election Day. Until now, foreign policy has not had a major role in a campaign dominated by the coronavirus, racial issues and the economy.
 Besides Republicans, a few House Democrats attended the event, a notable development at a time when their leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is barely on speaking terms with the president. Many Democrats, including presidential nominee Joe Biden, support the deal.
 “It is good to see others in the Middle East recognizing Israel and even welcoming it as a partner,.” Biden said in a statement released Wednesday night. “A Biden-Harris Administration will build on these steps, challenge other nations to keep pace, and work to leverage these growing ties into progress toward a two-state solution and a more stable, peaceful region.”
 Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., said she accepted the White House invitation immediately on receiving it over the weekend. “It definitely was a monumental event, and the ceremony was very fitting for that,” Luria, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a telephone interview afterward.
 Like Luria, some other Democrats in attendance, such as Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York, are freshmen in tough reelection races. Still others, such as Florida Reps. Ted Deutch and Stephanie Murphy hail from districts with large numbers of Jewish constituents.
 Questions remain, however, about the significance of the agreements. Even in Israel, where the accords have received widespread acclaim, there is concern they might result in U.S. sales of sophisticated weaponry to the UAE and Bahrain, thus potentially upsetting Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region.
 Trump said he is OK with selling military aircraft to the UAE. Pelosi also welcomed the agreements but said she wants to learn details, specifically what the Trump administration has told the UAE about buying American-made F-35 aircraft and about Israel agreeing to freeze efforts to annex portions of the West Bank.
 The UAE and Bahrain have a history of suppressing dissent and critical public opinion, but there have been indications that the agreements are not nearly as popular or well-received as they are in Israel. Neither country sent its head of state or government to sign the deals with Netanyahu.
 Bahrain’s largest Shiite-dominated opposition group, Al-Wefaq, which the government ordered dissolved in 2016 amid a yearslong crackdown on dissent, said there is widespread rejection of normalization.
 The ceremony followed months of intricate diplomacy headed by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and the president’s envoy for international negotiations, Avi Berkowitz. On Aug. 13, the Israel-UAE deal was announced. That was followed by the first direct commercial flight between the countries, and then the Sept. 11 announcement of the Bahrain-Israel agreement.

The Big Ten Conference, the Pac-12's longtime Rose Bowl partner, has decided to reverse course and flip its decision to postpone fall football that was made back in August. The league is now a full-go for a football season that will begin in late October after leaders in that conference came to an agreement that it would be safe enough to return to action after weeks of pleading by athletic departments, coaches, players, parents and fans.
 “From the onset of the pandemic, our highest priority has been the health and the safety of our students. The new medical protocols and standards put into place by the Big Ten Return To Competition Task Force were pivotal in the decision to move forward with sports in the conference,” said Morton Schapiro, Chair of the Big Ten Council of Presidents/Chancellors and Northwestern University President, and Chair of the Return to Competition Task Force Steering Committee. “We appreciate the conference’s dedication to developing the necessary safety procedures for our students and the communities that embrace them.”
 The decision leaves the Pac-12 as the only Power Five conference not set to try and play football this fall. The ACC and Big 12 seasons have already started and the SEC is set to begin its season later this month.
 Naturally, the attention will now turn to the Pac-12 and whether or not it will be next to change course and play football this fall. A big step forward came earlier in the month when the conference announced its partnership to bring Quidel Corporation's Sofia 2 machines to each Pac-12 campus to allow for rapid-results antigen testing for COVID-19.
 Commissioner Larry Scott called the breakthrough a "game-changer" for a return to competition. It should be noted that Arizona has been ahead of the curve with the Quidel tests already having been in use in UA's athletic department since the spring.
 There are more hurdles to jump for the Pac-12 in its return-to-play plan since government health restrictions in California and Oregon mean half of the league's teams are currently not allowed to practice and prepare for any fall season.
 “At this time, our universities in California and Oregon do not have approval from state or local public health officials to start contact practice,” Scott said in a statement released shortly after the Big Ten's announcement Wednesday. “We are hopeful that our new daily testing capability can help satisfy public health official approvals in California and Oregon to begin contact practice and competition.
 "We are equally closely monitoring the devastating fires and air quality in our region at this time. We are eager for our student-athletes to have the opportunity to play this season, as soon as it can be done safely and in accordance with public health authority approvals.”
 That led into some confusion Wednesday afternoon as California governor Gavin Newsom said current health guidelines in his state would not prevent college football teams from playing this fall, and he cited the confusion as being a "misrepresentation of the facts."
 However, teams such as USC, UCLA, Cal and Stanford are currently not permitted to train or practice in groups larger than 12 people meaning it would be nearly impossible to practice under the current guidelines.
 "There's nothing in the state guidelines that denies the Pac-12 from having conference games," Newsom said during a press conference Wednesday. "There's nothing in our guidelines the state put out that denies these games from occurring. We put out very, I thought, thoughtful guidelines, again in partnership with the NCAA about cohorting during workouts and practices.
 "Now this manifests very differently depending on the sport. Basketball cohorting of up to 12 may be a little easier than football up to 12, but offensive teams, defensive teams are able to coordinate and practice and the like. So I want to make this crystal clear — nothing in the state guidelines deny the ability for the Pac-12 to resume. Quite the contrary.
 "... I look forward to working as we have been in a constructive dialogue with the Pac-12 and NCAA on testing issues. Again, good progress in that space, and as it relates to cohorting, we are certainly willing to engage and have now engaged the Pac-12 in that discussion as well."
 While Newsom wants to make it clear that teams can move forward and here is nothing in the state guidelines preventing that, there are still local county guidelines that present another hurdle for the college teams looking to get back to work in addition to figuring out how to practice in groups of players 12 or smaller.
 The Wednesday comments from Newsom come the day after several prominent USC players and other players around the league voiced their opinion in a letter to Newsom expressing their desire to return to the field and hoping to have restrictions loosened allowing them to play this season.
 Arizona quarterback Grant Gunnell released a similar letter Wednesday afternoon penned by UA players with the hopes of urging the governor to allow teams to return to the field in California.
 The Big Ten is moving forward, but for the Pac-12 there seems to be just a lot more confusion and a lot more uncertainty about when teams in the league will actually have an opportunity to compete once again.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said he expects to get a report Thursday about&nbsp;Oracle’s bid for the Chinese-owned video- sharing app TikTok&nbsp;and admitted there is no legal path to letting the U.S. Treasury get a cut of the deal — a proposition experts had criticized as unprecedented and possibly illegal.“I’m not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal,” Trump told White House reporters Wednesday evening about Oracle’s interest in TikTok.Some in the U.S. have raised concerns about the deal, fearing that ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company that owns TikTok, would maintain access to information on the 100 million TikTok users in the United States.“It has to be 100% as far as national security is concerned,” Trump said.The president previously said that he would ban TikTok if it wasn’t sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 order, Trump said TikTok “reportedly censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive,” is potentially a source for disinformation campaigns and “threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.”TikTok maintains that it has not shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government and would not do so, says it does not censor videos at the request of Chinese authorities and notes that moderators for U.S. operations are led by a U.S. team.Trump said he was stunned to learn that the Treasury could not receive any payment in exchange for the U.S. signing off on the deal.“Amazingly, I find that you’re not allowed to do that,” Trump said. “If they’re willing to make big payments to the government they’re not allowed because ... there’s no legal path to doing that. ... How foolish can we (the United States) be?”TikTok, which says it has 100 million users in the U.S. and 700 million globally, is known for fun, goofy videos of dancing, lip-syncing, pranks and jokes. It’s also home to more political material, some of which is critical of Trump.The Oracle arrangement, according to a person familiar with the matter who isn’t authorized to speak publicly, entrusts TikTok’s U.S. user data to Oracle, which would oversee technical operations for TikTok in the U.S. Oracle won’t develop code for the app, but will review it and updates to it.Not all Republicans are on board with the Oracle deal. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a frequent critic of both China and the tech sector, called for the government to reject the Oracle partnership and instead pursue a full sale of TikTok in the U.S. or ban the app.“An ongoing ‘partnership’ that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable, and flatly inconsistent with the President’s Executive Order of Aug. 6,” he wrote on Tuesday.A group of six other Republican senators led by Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday sent a letter to the president expressing reservations about the partnership agreement with Oracle, saying that it appears to have “significant unresolved national security issues” and that a deal “must ensure that TikTok’s U.S. operations, data and algorithms are entirely outside the control of ByteDance or any Chinese-state directed actors.”A Trump executive order has set a Sept. 20 deadline, although it isn’t clear what will happen on that day. TikTok has sued to stop the ban, which also affects a separately owned Chinese messaging app, WeChat, which is used by several million in the U.S.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

After Inlander reporter Daniel Walters wrote a story about Rep. Jenny Graham sharing Facebook posts linking to conspiracy theory websites, the Republican lawmaker left Walters an explicit and threatening minute-and-a-half voicemail, posted profanity toward Walters on Facebook and shared another site connected to conspiracy theories.
 Shortly after publishing his story Aug. 27, Walters missed a call from Graham. He called back immediately, as Graham was leaving him a voicemail. When Graham answered, Walters asked whether there was anything factually incorrect in his story. “I wanted to get it corrected as quickly as possible,” Walters told The Spokesman-Review.
 Graham did not point to anything specific. Then, the line disconnected, Walters wrote in a piece for the Inlander.
 He checked his voicemail and found an angry message from Graham.
 “You’ve done it,” she said in the voicemail. “You have started it. Don’t ever call me again. Do you understand? Don’t you ever – and you tell your buddies not to call me either. It’s on. If you think for one minute you’re going to pull this crap and you’re going to walk away from it, you’re nuts.”
 Walters tried to call her back to have a conversation about what was wrong. He said he left her a voicemail and sent her a text message asking for a discussion, off the record if she wanted. His editor also tried calling her.
 The Inlander still had not heard back as of Tuesday afternoon. Graham did not respond to The Spokesman-Review’s requests for comment Tuesday.
 The original story about Graham’s sharing of conspiracy sites did not make any specific accusations that she was actively promoting conspiracies, Walters said. Graham told Walters she isn’t telling people to believe one way or the other, but that she does care about the issues from the articles she shared, such as vaccines and human trafficking.
 In an 80-minute interview with Walters for his Aug. 27 story, Graham said she was unaware of the ties to conspiracy theories on those sites.
 Graham shared several articles on Facebook from websites that published false information and promoted conspiracies from QAnon, a baseless far-right theory that President Donald Trump is secretly battling a network of powerful Satanic cannibal sex traffickers.
 Walters told The Spokesman-Review there wasn’t anything he could tell was factually wrong. He said he double-checked all of his reporting, including screenshots from Graham’s Facebook page that link to stories tied to conspiracy theories.
 In Walters’ story Monday, he included screenshots from Facebook posts and the voicemail, as well as a nearly 80-minute recording of his interview with Graham for the August story.
 He said he’s trying to put all of his evidence out there so people can make decisions for themselves.
 A Washington State Democrats press release that called the Republican Party under Trump the “Party of QAnon” mentioned Graham as an example, citing posts she has made regarding vaccines and the supposed ineffectiveness of masks.
 In June, Graham shared a post that included a picture of Dr. Anthony Fauci and featured conflicting statements about the previously used experimental coronavirus treatment drug hydroxychloroquine and a vaccine. The post was initially shared by a Facebook user in Alabama who has also shared articles from far-right news website Breitbart and memes critical of Democrats.
 Facebook also flagged a post by Graham as “untrue” as it falsely claimed Fauci supported the use of the vaccine before clinical trials.
 At the time, Graham said she only shared the post because she was concerned about vaccine promotion happening too quickly.
 For the weeks that followed her phone call, Graham posted multiple times on Facebook about Walters, calling him “disgusting,” “hateful”, “sleazy” and a “lying piece of dung.”
 The president has also been a vocal critic of the media. Since before he took office, he’s tweeted about “the fake news,” whose purported ranks he has also called “the enemy of the people.”
 Graham’s opponent in the November election, Democrat Tom McGarry, said as an elected official, you are required to tell the truth.
 These conspiracy theories are more than a distraction, McGarry said, especially during a pandemic.
 “We don’t need people spinning wild and baselessly false conspiracy theories,” he said.
 McGarry called Graham’s response to Walters “extremely troubling,” but he said he wasn’t surprised as the theories are consistent with Graham’s positions.
 “Honestly, to use that type of language is unacceptable for anybody, but especially for an individual who is elected to office,” he said.
 Graham also posted on Facebook that she was suing the Inlander for libel and slander.
 Before Walters’ Aug. 27 story, he said his relationship with Graham was positive. She was a source he checked in with regularly. Minutes before the phone call, Walters said Graham was offering to help him find sources for another story.
 “This was definitely a dramatic change,” he said.
 Walters said the reason he felt Graham’s phone call was so newsworthy was the combination of profanity, threats and accusations that he lied.
 Moving forward, he doesn’t know what their relationship will be. He has had experiences with other sources who have disliked a story he wrote, but they were able to have a conversation about it and move on.
 Walters said his job is to continue to report the news no matter what.
 “It’s not the job of a reporter to hold personal grudges,” he said. “It’s our job to continue to report without whitewashing anything of the past.”

Communication is key in all aspects of your relationship, but many couples find it hard to talk about sex. But by not talking about it, you're only prolonging the problem. Couples who are experiencing being stuck in a rut with their sex life might end up blaming the other partner or themselves for the problem, which is just another factor that makes it difficult to bring up - after all, you don't want an argument or for either of you to be upset. However, clear communication is vital to ensure that you are able to get to the root of the issue and come to some agreements about what you can both do to start reigniting the spark.
