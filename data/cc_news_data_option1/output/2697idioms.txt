The lack of information available to the public. One thing that I have always preached is that the key to a successful investment strategy is to get enough relevant information to make informed decisions. For stocks with a micro-cap information is much harder to find. Companies listed on the "pink sheets" are not required to submit documents to the SEC, and therefore do not attract the close attention of the public and are not regulated as the shares traded at the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges. In addition, most of the information about promotions from the micro-cap, as a rule, not from a trusted source.

Don’t need all the techie bells and whistles? You can’t go wrong with the Vitamix 5200 Standard. At $449.95, it has all that Vitamix power and a taller, narrower, high-profile container. In fact, this is our one nit with the Venturist: Its low-profile container design is awesome for blending up big portions, but it doesn’t work as well as the 5200’s narrower version (read more on the 5200 and the Ascent A3300 below).

The bottom line: Higher cost also means increased performance and a longer- lasting machine, so if you’re a frequent blender, we think they’re worth the investment in the long run (and just think how much you’ll save by skipping your daily $8 smoothie by making your own version at home). But if you rarely have the need to blend — and prefer Skippy to your own custom almond butter⁠ — a budget model should suit your needs just fine.

We ran each blender through the same four tests to see how well they performed when making a green smoothie, making vegetable soup, turning peanuts into peanut butter and crushing ice. If included, we used the applicable preset program on the model (for example, smoothie, soup or ice). We used the exact same ingredients for each blender tested. The models we tested covered a large price range: from $39.99 to a truly splurge-worthy $629.99.

So if, if Sony could make this tech work, and if it turns out to be more than just a fancy PS Now upgrade, it'd be a huge advantage. Imagine being able to say you can play hundreds of games on the PS5 out of the box, rather than just the few that'll be available at launch. Also, it'd just be great to see Sony pay tribute to the classic games we otherwise can only play if we take out an old console or (horrors) own a PS Vita.

Our favorite accessory, however, is the tamper, a plastic tool made to insert through the blender’s lid to help break up air bubbles or other jams while the machine is still running, and sized so that they won’t hit the blades, which could lead to damage. If you don’t have a vortex while blending your thick smoothie, instead of stopping the machine, taking off the lid, using a spoon or adding more liquid to get things moving again, simply tamp the ingredients down into the blades and you’ll likely be right back in business.

The biggest thing that sets these models apart from the rest of the crowd is their motor size. High-performance models clock in at a powerful 1,400-plus watts, while budget blenders are typically in the 500-watt range. Higher- powered motors mean you get the right vortex needed for creamier blends, especially when blending fibrous fruits and vegetables, herbs, nuts and thick smoothies and drinks. A good rule of thumb: Go with the highest number of watts your budget allows.

LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - Two middle school teams from Southcrest Christian School have won the national title in the U.S. Army’s eCyberMission STEM Competition.The sixth and seventh-grade teams won this year. The seventh-grade team is a repeat national winner.KCBD talked to Alexa Tindall, Josiah Morales, and Ethan Djajadi after they won the national title for the 2019 contest. On June 19, 2020, the trio, now in seventh grade, won the title for the second year in a row. Their 2020 project was called ‘Code Red.' The trio researched something that hit close to home for one of the students.“Our project this year was about firefighters and the cancer they develop - the carcinogens released during the smoke or fire,” Morales said. “We decided to research this project because my dad is a firefighter. His friends just recently got cancer and we wanted to be able to prevent that.”The group worked on projects and experiments with community partners; they even had mentors through Texas Tech University. The group was able to perform experiments in the university’s labs.“The main thing was the fact that even though we are young, we are still being able to do these more advanced experiments in order to help people in the future,” Tindall said.The team won and went on to represent the South-Central Region against five other seventh- grade teams from across the country. The national event, typically held in Washington D.C., was canceled due to COVID-19 and was held virtually.Djajadi said he couldn’t contain his excitement when their team was announced as this year’s winners. “When they announced our name, I popped off.”The sixth-grade team’s project was called Carbon Keepers. The group says they were inspired to do their research after watching a TED talk.The team included Briley Siemens, Felipe de Farias, and Eliza Cole-Smith“It (the TED talk) was talking about how farming could the solution to climate change. We knew that since our area is built upon farming, we want to include that,” said Siemens. “When we started researching and we found out other things that can make the soil healthier and keep the carbon into the soil. So, we started researching like additives and things such as wildfire and drought. And then we start researching pollutants as well.”The group also teamed up with community partners and the group had mentors from Texas Tech University to help them conduct experiments.Their findings were published into 12 different languages and the team reached out to 16 different countries.Each one of the students received a $10,000 dollar savings bond. The seventh-grade team, Code Red, also gets bragging rights for winning the title two years in a row.For more information on team Code Red’s project, you can visit their website, click here.

Jim Alexander is an Inland Empire native who started with his hometown newspaper, The Press-Enterprise, longer ago than he cares to admit. He's been a sports columnist off and on since 1992, and a full-time columnist since 2010. Yes, he's opinionated, but no, that's not the only club in his bag. He's covered every major league and major sports beat in Southern California over the years, so not much surprises him any more. (And he and Justin Turner have this in common: Both attended Cal State Fullerton. Jim has no plans to replicate Turner's beard.)
