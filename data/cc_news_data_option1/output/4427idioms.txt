by Chuck Ansbacher Tampa, FL—While there must be a family reunion somewhere that regularly posts a 300-plus headcount, it’s highly unlikely that said reunion also comes equipped with its own tradeshow. But then again, most families aren’t AVI-SPL—the integration behemoth with $550 million in 2011 revenues, and so many consecutive years at the number-one spot on SCN’s Top 50 that everyone has all but stopped counting. AVI-SPL is such a power house that this year’s national sales…

Of course there are rules about these things, the Big Ten will only allow stadiums to pump in crowd noise up to a certain decibel level and the conference will test the levels prior to the game to make sure things are on the up-and-up. But once they get the green light, expect just a bit of noise to still cascade down from the stands.

SOUTHAMPTON, Bermuda
 Doc Redman found the wind far more manageable Saturday, and he took advantage with a 4-under 67 for a one-shot lead going into the final round of the Bermuda Championship.
 The wind came out of the opposite direction as the previous day and it wasn't quite as strong. It showed in the scores and in the number of opportunities for players who never won or have gone without winning in years.
 Redman was at 10-under 203, one shot ahead of Ryan Armour (70), Wyndham Clark (70) and Kramer Hickok (69), who took three putts from a tough spot on the fringe on the 18th at Port Royal.
 Another shot behind were Matt Jones (66), Brian Gay (67) and Ollie Schniederjans (69). Jones was bogey-free in the third round, which to him was as impressive as any of his five birdies.
 Redman, the 2017 U.S. Amateur champion, is among 10 players separated by four shots who have never won on the PGA Tour. A victory Sunday comes with an invitation to the Masters next April.

I don't imagine I'll ever write a book for young people that doesn't include an intergenerational theme — for me that was such a big part of growing up. And I think literature that is contemplating the family, you need the parents coming in and they can't be perfect. They can't, you know, save the day on their own. And with this father, it was very easy to make him a villain. I wanted it to be more nuanced than that, that a person could be a terrible partner, or have made a mistake, and potentially still have made incredible memories with their children. And for the characters to have to come to terms with who their parents are, even though their parents will never be able to ask them for forgiveness. I feel like that's a big question. You know, I've had to ask — my father's never going to say certain things, but my own growth requires me to be able to forgive.

AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo.
 Jack Sears threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score while filling in for starter Hank Bachmeier, Avery Williams scored on an 88-yard kickoff return and No. 25 Boise State beat Air Force 49-30 on Saturday night.
 CT Thomas hauled in two of Sears' TD passes, including a 75-yarder on the game's first play. The Broncos have now captured 11 straight Mountain West games. It's their longest streak since joining the league in 2011.
 Boise State (2-0, 2-0 MW) was without Bachmeier after the sophomore QB didn't make the trip for an unspecified reason. Sears, a transfer from USC, made the most of his chance by finishing 17 of 20 for 280 yards and no turnovers.
 Backup tailback Andrew Van Buren scored on a pair of short runs as he stepped in for George Holani, who appeared to be banged up in the first quarter and didn't carry the ball again.
 Air Force (1-2, 0-2) saw its nine-game home winning streak snapped. The last team to win at Falcon Stadium? Boise State, in 2018.

Atlona has announced that the company's digital connectivity solutions are being used by the San Francisco 49ers and Centerplate — the largest hospitality partner to North America's premier sports stadiums, convention centers, and entertainment venues — as part of a new digital menu board system at Candlestick Park. Denver-based Ping HD installed multiple Atlona HDMI® distribution amplifiers (AT-HD-V12 1x2), HDMI EDID emulators (AT-HDSync), and 50-foot-plus HDMI cables throughout the park's 20 concession stands to send HDMI signals to more than 100 TVs while maintaining the hot plug 5V.
    "In a facility this large, with displays so far apart, it was a significant challenge to send an HDMI signal from a single source to 100-plus TVs, all while maintaining the hot plug 5V to ensure that no TV turned itself off due to inactivity of the HDMI ports," said Kevin Goldsmith, director of digital media operations for Ping HD. "We've been an Atlona customer for some time now and have grown to trust and rely on their solutions. We didn't even consider other brands for a project of this magnitude."
 Instead of running a single HDMI cable over thousands of feet and degrading the signal, Ping HD relied on Atlona's HDMI distribution amplifiers to ensure video quality. The AT-HD-V12 takes an incoming signal from a digital signage "master" TV, and then splits it into two HDMI signals, which are sent to two other TVs using Atlona's 50-foot-plus HDMI cables. To provide a constant hot plug, Atlona's HDMI EDID emulators (AT-HDSync) embed the incoming HDMI signal with a 5V current, which wakes up the TVs from standby mode.
 "The system is up and running, and is not only being used to allow customers to view their choices of food and beverage, but also to show other important stadium and emergency information," added Goldsmith. "The digital menus are a hit with fans, and our client loves the simplicity and clarity brought by the ability to show digital signage on the TVs, as well as the level of integration achieved due to Atlona's products. Another important factor is the system's ease of use — it is totally self operating, which eliminates the need for a dedicated employee to monitor it."
