Born in Merrillville, Eugene Wilson went on to star for the hometown Pirates, eventually leading to a collegiate and professional football career where he won two Super Bowl rings with the New England Patriots.
 At Merrillville, Wilson was a letterman in football and basketball. He was a two-time All-State selection and, as a senior, was named the Duneland Athletic Conference's defensive player of the year. In basketball, he was a four-year varsity letterman and starter, and was a two-time All-DAC selection.
 He attended the University of Illinois, where he majored in speech communications. The safety finished his career with 176 tackles (139 solo, 37 assists), 11 interceptions and 60 pass deflections. He also had 93 punt returns for 896 yards and two touchdowns.
 Wilson was selected in the second round (36th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. He helped the Patriots win Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2003 and Super Bowl XXXIX in 2004. In '04, he recovered a fumble by Philadelphia Eagles tight end L.J. Smith before leaving the game after sustaining an injury on a kickoff. He also intercepted Ben Roethlisberger in a 41-27 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2004 AFC Championship.
 In 2007 against the New York Jets, Wilson returned a Kellen Clemens interception for a touchdown, making him the 21st Patriot to score a touchdown that season, tying an NFL record. Wilson bounced around in 2008, signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 14 before being released Sept. 1 that same year. Two days after his release, he was signed by the Houston Texans, where he had an interception in a win over the Tennessee Titans on Sept. 20.
 On February 18, 2011, the Texans released Wilson. He played 96 games in his eight-year career finishing with 399 tackles, four fumble recoveries, 41 pass deflections and 14 interceptions.

Virgil "Gus" Grissom was one of NASA's original seven Mercury astronauts, the first American to go into space a second time. He died in a tragic fire while training for the Apollo 1 mission.
 Grissom was born April 3, 1926, in Mitchell, near Spring Mill State Park. He is one of many astronauts who graduated from Purdue University.
 He signed up as an aviation cadet during World War II, but Japan surrendered before he could receive his training, according to Grissom's NASA biography. He flew 100 missions in the Korean War, earning the Air Medal with cluster and the Distinguished Flying Cross during his tour of duty. Grissom asked to fly 25 additional missions, but the U.S. Air Force sent him back to the States instead.
 He was one of 110 military test pilots invited to try out for the space program and on April 13, 1959, became one of the original seven astronauts.
 On July 21, 1961, Grissom became the second American in space, following Alan Shepard's successful flight. Grissom named his craft the Liberty Bell 7. It was the first NASA spacecraft to use a small explosive charge to open the hatch. The flight lasted about 15 minutes, ending in an Atlantic Ocean landing.
 The Liberty Bell 7 hatch blew unexpectedly, and water filled the capsule, but Grissom was able to swim to safety.
 "In all of my years of flying — including combat in Korea — this was the first time that my aircraft and I had not come back together," Grissom said in his 1968 autobiography, "Gemini: A Personal Account of Man's Venture Into Space."
 Shepard was to be the first commander to go into outer space in the Gemini program, but after he experienced severe nausea, vomiting and dizziness, Grissom flew instead. John Young, one of the second batch of astronauts, was Grissom's the other member of Grissom's crew.
 Among the experiments on that flight was to test special food designed to consumption in outer space, according to the NASA biography. Then there was the other food on the flight.
 Young smuggled a corned beef sandwich, one of Grissom's favorite foods, in a pocket of his space food.
 "After the flight our superiors at NASA let us know in no uncertain terms that non-man-rated corned beef sandwiches were out for future space missions," Grissom wrote.
 In March 1966, NASA announced that Grissom was to be commander for the first Apollo mission to orbit Earth.
 Grissom wasn't satisfied with the spaceshift designed for his crew. The launch was postponed.
 On Jan. 27, 1967, a fire broke out while Lt. Col. Grissom, Lt. Col. Edward H. White and Lt. Cmdr. Roger B. Chafee were doing tests in the command module of the Apollo 1 spacecraft. The air around them seemed to ignite in the tiny space, in an atmosphere of pure oxygen. Within seconds, the module atop the Saturn 1 rocket cracked, and black smoke billowed out.
 All three died in the fire, NASA's first tragedy.

Fast food entrepreneur Junior Bridgeman couldn't believe what he heard while working next to an employee one day, a young man who seemed quiet and distant.
 "How's it going?" asked Bridgeman, trying to break the ice.
 The kid shrugged as if to say "What is it to you?"
 Bridgeman wondered how life had been treating his employee and was told, bluntly: "Today is no different than tomorrow's going to be or the day after that."
 Most employers might shake their head regretfully and walk away. But the 1971 E.C. Washington grad and former NBA star is not your ordinary boss.
 Bridgeman helped lead unbeaten Washington to the 1971 state basketball championship, then starred at Louisville before enjoying a productive 12-year NBA career, much of it with the Milwaukee Bucks.
 As CEO of Bridgeman Hospitality Group, he owns 244 Wendy's franchises and 120 Chili's franchises — more than 400 stores counting the Perkins Restaurants and Fazoli's he also runs.
 That's 18,000 employees and all are an integral part of Bridgeman's food empire. So much, in fact, his businesses offer health care and educational assistance to help workers improve their lifestyles.
 Years ago, he established a charter school in Milwaukee and then a boys school in Louisville, where he claims there are 1,000 homeless children.
 Some, like that quiet kid, can be impossible to reach.
 "He told me what he was doing ... he was in the illegal drug business," Bridgeman recalled. "He's just a teenager, so your heart breaks because you know where that life can lead. He was not ashamed to tell me 'This is the only reason I'm here.'"
 The boy wanted to have a W-2 form to hide his income.
 "As I stood there and listened to him, I wondered just how did it get to this point? How did it become so acceptable that he had no qualms about telling me and that it had become sort of a badge of honor for him out in the community," Bridgeman said.
 "He told me the only way that changes is if maybe he moves up in whatever hierarchy they had, but he did not see himself in a situation that would be improving at all."
 Bridgeman spoke in November 2014 at a Gary Chamber of Commerce luncheon. He spoke about having dreams, a backup plan, specific goals, and the importance of a solid education.
 Most kids will never become professional athletes, the odds are heavily against them, but education or technical training can open countless doors to a fulfilling life.
 "Not everybody has the ability to get a four-year degree or an advanced degree but you can become a plumber or electrician and be successful," Bridgeman said. "It's the training that matters."
 Today, his net worth is estimated at almost $600 million.

This week is the Masters, the most important annual tournament in golf. The tournament, which is held at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Ga., was pushed from its usual April date to November due to COVID-19. Augusta National is a power hitter’s delight, with many of the game’s biggest hitters winning there in recent years. Bubba Watson won his first Masters in 2012, at a time when he too held a substantial lead over the rest of the Tour in driving distance. In 2012, he averaged 315.5 yards off the tee, clearing everybody else by at least 3.9 yards on average. While a margin of 3.9 seems small compared to DeChambeau’s 10.6-yard margin this season, no driving distance leader between 2013 and 2020 was able to match Watson’s lead, as hitters have become more powerful than ever in the past decade. Watson was able to overcome Louis Oosthuizen in a playoff in that year’s Masters, a competitor who he outdrove by more than fifteen yards over the course of that season.

The Creek is the second comedy club to close this year, after Dangerfield’s shut its doors last month after 50 years in business. And it comes at a particularly grim time for the New York City comedy scene, with comics relegated to outdoor shows since the city shut down performance venues in March. Club owners came together back in September to lobby Governor Cuomo for permission to reopen under the same regulations as indoor dining.

Trent, who has been the Creek’s owner and booker for the past 14 years, spoke to Vulture briefly about the club’s closure. “Comedy is essential and they’re going to have to figure something out before this happens to other clubs,” she wrote in a text message. “When the city loses its culturals it loses its heart.”

You kind of put that on hold until you retire.”

 While the pandemic may have opened a window of opportunity for Haley in Hungary, it works against her and the Rams at a time when they're ripe for a U Sports title.
 "Everybody's recruiting kind of goes in cycles and we are at the peak right now," Haley said. "The majority of our team are third, fourth, fifth year players.
 "This current season and potentially next season are kind of our best kick at the can within a five-year window."

Jo Anne Worley is perhaps best known for her role in Rowan and Martin's Laugh- In, where she was a standout in the ensemble cast. But she first got people laughing in Lowell, her hometown.
 Worley told The Times in 2014 that participating in the church choir with her sister in Lowell and starring in the annual Lowell High School talent show gave her an early start at developing her voice.
 "I used to pantomime a lot and sing along with songs while growing up," she said.
 "I'll never forget the place I'd work every summer while in high school. It was called Robert's Hotel, Gas and Cafe and it was at the intersection of U.S. 41 and Highway 2. They had an old jukebox in the cafe where I worked and I'd sing and joke around whenever business was slow, which seemed like most of the time."
 Worley was born Sept. 6, 1937. After graduating from Lowell High School in 1955, Worley pursued her education and career. In 1961, her role in the popular Los Angeles musical revue "Billy Barnes People" gained her a spot on Broadway.
 She has a long list of accomplishments on stage and screen, but that's not her only interest. She also has supported Actors and Others for Animals.

REGINA - The Saskatchewan government says it will enact new public health measures to stem the province's rising number of COVID-19 infections.
 Masks have been mandatory in indoor public spaces in Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert for about a week.
 Health officials reported 111 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday, the sixth day in a row the province recorded more than 100 new cases.
 The province says 49 people were in hospital, one more than on Wednesday, and 13 people were receiving intensive care, an increase of two.
 Pressure has been building on Premier Scott Moe's newly elected government to get a handle on the spread of the virus after a month of rising infections and hospitalizations.

Oliver P. Morton, Indiana's 14th governor, led the state through the difficult Civil War years.
 Morton, a Republican, served Jan. 16, 1861, to Jan. 23, 1867.
 He was born Aug. 4, 1823 in Wayne County, the first governor born in Indiana.
 Morton was a close ally of President Abraham Lincoln, a fellow Republican, and promptly pledged 10,000 Hoosiers to meet Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers after war broke out in 1861. Morton also established a state arsenal, without legislative approval, to equip Indiana's ill-provisioned troops.
 He cultivated a reputation as "the soldier's friend" by traveling to battlefield hospitals, establishing a state relief program and through the Indiana Sanitary Commission distributing food, clothes, Bibles, writing paper and tobacco to Hoosier troops.
 At the same time, Morton sought to undermine his Democratic political opponents by explicitly accusing them of disloyalty, and even suggesting they would side with the Confederates if Indiana were invaded.
 Union losses early in the war and Lincoln's decision to change the justification for the war — from the popular preserving the Union to the decidedly unpopular call to end slavery — produced Democratic legislative majorities in 1863.
 Not wanting to lose his near-dictatorial powers in military and state personnel matters, Morton proceeded to shun the General Assembly. He refused to give his State of the State address in person and directed legislative Republicans to boycott meetings.
 GOP lawmakers even left Indianapolis at Morton's direction and relocated to the Kentucky border for two years, prepared to flee the state, if necessary, to ensure the Legislature would not have a quorum to do business.
 As a result, Indiana did not enact a state budget, leaving Morton to borrow money wherever he could find it to keep Indiana operating. Because he did not trust the Democratic state treasurer, Morton essentially ran the state himself out of a safe in his office.
 Morton's Democratic fear-mongering largely fell apart as a serious matter in July 1863 when southern Hoosiers fought off Confederate invaders in Morgan's Raid. Nevertheless, Morton used the threat of Democratic sedition, and the timely return home of some 9,000 soldiers, to win election as governor in his own right in 1864.
 Attempts to use the one-term limit of the 1851 Constitution to prevent Morton from running again came to naught as Morton persuaded voters that he only was elected lieutenant governor in 1860, despite having served just two days in that office before advancing to the top job.
 After the Civil War, Morton continued to pound Democrats, calling the party in 1866: "A common sewer and loathsome receptacle into which is emptied every element of treason North and South."
 He resigned as governor in 1867 after the General Assembly, now back in Republican hands, elected him to the U.S. Senate.
 In Washington, Morton quickly changed his opposition to black voting rights and joined with the Radical Republicans to win passage of the 15th Amendment. Morton even returned to Indianapolis to engineer the amendment's approval by the Indiana Legislature after Hoosier Democratic lawmakers resigned en masse to prevent a quorum.
 In 1876, Morton ran for president and came in second place on the first nominating ballot at the Republican Party convention that ultimately chose Rutherford B. Hayes as its candidate.
 Following the disputed contest between Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden, who got more popular votes than Hayes, Morton served on the commission that cut a deal to make Hayes president in exchange for ending the Reconstruction policies Morton supported to remake the former Confederacy.
 Morton died Nov. 1, 1877, at age 54. He is buried in Indianapolis.
 Morton today is remembered with a large statute outside the east entrance to the Statehouse that proclaims him "The Great War Governor."
 Morton High School in Hammond, whose sports teams are the "Governors," also is named in his honor.

 That was the theory at the heart of chemistry teacher Catherine Sieber’s decision to spearhead Lincoln-Way Central High School’s application for an Illinois Solar Schools grant from the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation (ICECF) in 2018.
 Sieber, who also sponsors the school’s Environmental Action Club, became interested in introducing solar energy in a school setting while attending an Illinois Clean Energy Foundation Solar Workshop. Working with a company that specializes in grant writing, she helped put together the application that resulted in a grant to cover the cost of installing four solar panels at the school.

The Browns were leading the NFL with more than 200 yards rushing per game when Chubb went down. They’ve dropped to fifth with a 150.0 yard average, but the combination of Chubb and Kareem Hunt might be able to push that up against a Houston defense that is the league’s worst at stopping the run (159.5 yards per game).
 “Nothing against our other backs because we believe in those guys as well, but having that two-headed monster of those guys being able to sub fresh legs in as needed, that is something that we are extremely blessed to have,” said Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield.
 With rain in the forecast, Texans interim coach Romeo Crennel expects the Browns to pound the ball.
 “We know we have our hands full, but we have to try to load up on the run as best we can, and knowing that if you load up on the run, that opens some things up on the back end,” Crennel said. “We have a lot of things that we have to work out.”

The son of former basketball star Glenn Robinson has made a name for himself in the same sport as his father.
 He even did something pops never could: Win the NBA Slam Dunk Contest.
 A late bloomer who was a junior varsity player as a freshman at Lake Central, "Trey" emerged the following season, when he led the Indians in scoring. By his senior year, which saw Lake Central capture a sectional title, he had developed into a top recruit. He led Lake Central to a sectional title and chose to continue the region pipeline by committing to Michigan.
 In his two seasons in Ann Arbor, the Wolverines enjoyed unprecedented success, winning 59 games in the span. One of three Northwest Indiana players on the UM roster, Robinson shined on the national stage, playing a key role in a run to the 2013 national championship game, where Michigan fell to Louisville. His stock rose to the point that he was projected to be a first-round draft pick, but he chose to return for his sophomore season.
 The Wolverines reached the 2014 regional final, falling to Kentucky, and the 6-foot-7 Robinson declared for the draft. He was taken 40th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves, but played sparingly and was waived late in his rookie year.
 Philadelphia claimed Robinson two days after and he finished the season there, making his first professional start in the season finale. The 76ers didn't make him a qualifying offer and Robinson became a free agent. He played in the summer league with Atlanta, eventually singing a three-year contract to play back in his home state with the Indiana Pacers for just over $1 million per season.
 Robinson entered the starting lineup in 2016, then became a national star in February when he claimed the NBA Slam Dunk championship.
 He briefly played for the Detroit Pistons during the 2018-19 season before becoming a free agent and signing with the Golden State Warriors. He has started all 25 games he's played in and is averaging a career-high 11.5 points and 4.7 rebounds per game.

When I look at the connections between these things, this is what I can deduce. Drawing floor plans was both creative and structured. Working to earn money using skills I learned to cut hair, mow lawns, and babysitting was a mix of things I enjoyed in tandem with a determination to finance myself. I was always in leadership roles, even in primary school, which identified my ability to rally people together for a common cause. The Navy was a highly structured organisation, as you would expect. Yet true creativity is a vital trait for military personnel who are successful. You must be able to adapt, call on regulations, and bend them so that you can achieve the desired end result. You need an overarching vision so that you can understand the importance of your part in it. The Navy also provided me with a never ending stream of varied tasks, projects and initiatives to implement.

Diana of the Dunes may be the Indiana Dunes' most well-known legend.
 Born Alice Mable Gray in Chicago on Nov. 28, 1881, Gray graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago with a degree in mathematics, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory website.
 She went to work at the USNO later that year.
 "If the monotony of computing was difficult for other bright women, it must have been especially difficult on Alice Gray, she was to say the least, a free spirit," according to the USNO site.
 She left the USNO in 1905, when she left Washington, D.C. for Germany to continue her studies. When she returned to the United States, she went to work in Chicago as a secretary.
 It was in 1915, at age 35, Gray decided to give up the city life and move — legend has it with just a jelly glass, a knife, a spoon, a blanket and two guns — to the Indiana Dunes and set up her home in an abandoned shack.
 However, if it was solitude she desired, the peaceful existence was short lived. An oddity of sorts — a woman living alone in nature — she was soon discovered by the Chicago media and dubbed Diana of the Dunes. During her 10 years living along the Dunes' shoreline, newspapers from Chicago to New York wrote about her life as a recluse.
 According to a 2010 book by Janet Zenke Edwards, "Diana of the Dunes: The True Story of Alice Gray," Gray spent her days exploring the dunes, swimming in Lake Michigan, reading, writing and learning about the ecology of the area.
 In 1920, Gray met Paul Eisenblatter, also known as Paul Wilson. Some accounts say the two married. They lived in a shack they called Wren's Nest. Her grave stone at Oak Hill Cemetery in Gary gives her name as Alice Gray Wilson.
 Gray died in 1925 from uremic poisoning, but her legend has continued in the some 90 years after her death. Some have reported her ghostly form still roams the dunes. She was honored for a while with a festival named after her, The Diana of the Dunes Festival and Pageant, held in Chesterton.

East Chicago native Kawann Short is in the third season of an impressive National Football League career, playing as a defensive end for the Carolina Panthers after excelling at that position in high school and college.
 Short was born in East Chicago on Feb. 2, 1989. He played football and basketball at East Chicago Central, and as a member of the basketball team — along with current Chicago Bull E'Twaun Moore — won the 4A state championship in 2007.
 In football, Short recorded 85 tackles, including nine sacks, two fumble recoveries and two blocked punts as a senior. He played in Indiana North-South All-Star Game.
 Short was not heavily recruited, but was offered a scholarship by Purdue University, where he played from 2008 to 2012, red-shirting for the 2008 season.
 While at Purdue, Short was named first-team All Big Ten in 2011 and 2012, and second-team All American in 2012.
 Short was drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers. He played all 16 regular season games his rookie year, and played in the divisional playoff against San Francisco.
 Midway through that year, he told The Times his goal for his career: "When I retire, I want to be remembered with guys like Warren Sapp and Vince Wilfork — big-name defensive players."
 Short started his first playoff game after the 2014 season, against the Arizona Cardinals, and recorded his first playoff sack.
 He played a strong role in Carolina's fast start to the 2015 season, earning the National Football Conference Defensive Player of the Month award for October.

If you know anything about music, or if you know anything about Indiana, you've heard of composer and songwriter Cole Porter.
 Porter has been dead more than 60 years, but his music lives on. The musical "De-Lovely" is based on Porter's life.
 His most popular musical, "Kiss Me, Kate," ran for 1,077 performances in New York and 400 in London. It won the first Tony Award for Best Musical. Porter won for best composer and lyricist.
 Porter was born June 9, 1891, in Peru to a wealthy family. When he was sent to Worcester Academy in Massachusetts in 1905, Porter took an upright piano with him.
 At Yale University, Porter was a member of a number of musical groups, including the Whiffenpoofs, an a cappella group. In his senior year, he was elected president of the Yale Glee Club and was its principal soloist. He wrote 300 songs at Yale, including the football fight songs "Bulldog" and "Bingo Eli Yale," also known as "Bingo, That's the Lingo!"
 In 1917, when the United States entered World War I, Porter moved to Paris. he maintained a luxury apartment and held wild parties.
 It was in 1928, at age 36, when Porter had his first hit Broadway musical, "Paris." Among the songs were "Let's Misbehave" and "Let's Do It."
 "The New Yorkers," in 1930, featured the song, "Love for Sale." "Gay Divorce," Fred Astaire's last stage show, in 1932, featured the still-popular song, "Night and Day." "Anything Goes," in 1934, was another hit.
 The soundtrack of "Anything Goes" has several songs that will get you singing, including "I Get a Kick Out of You," "All Through the Night," "You're the Top," "Blow, Gabriel, Blow" and, of course, "Anything Goes."
 Porter wrote a number of other familiar songs for shows in the 1930s, including, "Begin the Beguine," "It's De-Lovely," "In the Still of the Night," "Don't Fence Me In," "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," "Do I Love You?" and more.
 Also occurring in the 1930s was the riding accident that changed his life. He was riding with Countess Edith di Zoppola and Duke Fulco di Verdura in Locust Valley, New York, when his horse fell on him, crushing his legs and leaving him crippled.
 In 1948, Porter's hit musical "Kiss Me, Kate" debuted. It features several familiar standards, including "Another Op'nin', Another Show," "Too Darn Hot" and "Always True to You (in My Fashion)." The show became a Hollywood hit a few years later.
 Porter was famous enough that the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp in his honor in 1991, on the centennial of his birth.
 His life was chronicled in 1946 show "Night and Day" and the 2004 film "De- Lovely."
 Porter died of kidney failure on Oct. 15, 1964, at age 73. He is buried in Peru.
