“In the last few years, I realized I had to really shock Roberto,” says Scognamiglio. “We had a long talk, and I pushed him to design something else. He didn’t need to design the new Stella. So, he came up with this new collection, called ‘the Abracadabra,’ last year. It had nothing to do with what he had done before. We’re using titanium and ceramic colours, different stones, more graphic. Before, everything had to be nongraphic, linear forms, linear shapes, very smooth shapes. Suddenly, he sat at the drawing table, and I said, ‘Feel cool, feel young again, don’t feel like you should sell at Bergdorf Goodman, it might go somewhere else, it doesn’t matter.’ And he did it. It was like a rejuvenation. Even with my guys in the workshop here, we were so happy, because we had convinced Roberto to be less classic. Then he was unstoppable, he designed a whole collection of one-of-a-kind pieces. Now it’s our best-selling collection, even though we still love the Stella — the Stella is like the Alhambra of Van Cleef for us, it’s an incredible classic. He was so proud and so happy of this new rejuvenation.”

The Dolphyn project has led to the concept of islanded hydrogen being considered in National Grid's Future Energy Scenarios (FES).
 Rob Gibson is the whole system and gas supply manager for National Grid ESO. He and his team developed the emission, hydrogen and gas input for the FES scenarios. They consider a number of potential outcomes for the energy system with hydrogen an increasing area of focus.
 Gibson describes the various envisioned outcomes as "credible extremes." Its most ambitious, the Leading The Way scenario, sketches out a situation where the impending hydrogen economy uses all green hydrogen generated from renewable energy. Other scenarios rely more on "blue hydrogen," or hydrogen made from fossil fuel feedstocks with the resulting carbon emissions captured and stored.
 ## Skipping blue hydrogen for green?
 With the 10 GW proposal from RWE and partners now out in the open, Gibson considers the momentum for green hydrogen to be growing, even though he personally thinks a combination of blue and green is more likely.
 "It definitely adds a level of credibility around the potential for an all- green hydrogen future, and then skipping over, potentially the blue one," Gibson said in an interview. As it stands, blue hydrogen is being presented by some as a "transition" fuel for green.
 Of course, neither of these two technologies are proven at scale, making comparisons at this point a bit premature. Still, "there's a view that we hear when engaging with the industry that by the time blue hydrogen is up and running, the cost of green hydrogen could be equal to it," Gibson said. If that's the case, "why would you invest twice?"

Well, on most issues I’m a lot closer to Sanders than to Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate. But in this case I’m sorry to say that Manchin is right. The economic pain from the coronavirus has been very unevenly distributed: A minority of the workforce has been devastated, while those who have been able to keep working have, by and large, done relatively well. Overall wages and salaries have bounced back quickly.
 So if there’s a limit on the amount of aid that can be given, it’s more important to help the unemployed — and, in particular, to sustain that help well beyond the 10 weeks reportedly in the current deal — than to send checks to those who have been able to keep working. The best argument I can see for broader payments is political — people who haven’t lost their jobs to the pandemic may be more willing to support economic relief for those who have if they also get something from the deal.

In light of those challenges, piping hydrogen back to demand centers may make sense, particularly for a North Sea region that already hosts an extensive undersea pipeline infrastructure and deep industry experience in building it. So far, however, the earliest islanded hydrogen projects are starting small.
 Earlier in December, Siemens Gamesa announced an islanded green hydrogen trial in Denmark that will start operations next month. An existing 3 MW turbine is connected to an alkaline electrolyzer, and hydrogen will be transferred to tankers for use in Everfuel's hydrogen refueling stations. The Brande Hydrogen project 3 MW turbine will produce enough fuel for 50-70 taxis.
 "Once a wind farm can produce hydrogen independent of a grid, you can place the wind farm where you find the strongest winds on good sites without concerns for grid availability," Henrik Mortensen, senior business analysts for innovation and products at Siemens Gamesa, told GTM in an email.
 "With the EU's ambitions for green hydrogen production, it will be necessary to go to offshore wind. Here we see great potential in wind farms moving molecules to shore instead of electrons."
 ## Making the offshore hydrogen economics stack up
 Another islanded hydrogen project in the U.K., dubbed Dolphyn, is proposing a 2 MW and 10 MW pilot for floating wind turbines with on-board electrolyzers. An analysis by ERM, the firm behind Dolphyn, showed the total lifetime costs of four different set-ups.
 Two use floating turbines with electrolyzers, each using different floating foundations (single spar and semi-submersible). A third uses a central platform offshore for the hydrogen production, and the fourth simply runs the power back to onshore electrolyzers.
 At all distances from the shore, 50 km, 100 km and 250 km, a semi-submersible floating turbine with on-board electrolyzers was the cheapest. Beyond 100km, the costs of high-voltage cables back to shore start to create a gulf in cost.

Milton Keynes (UK), Dec 18 (AP) Mexican driver Sergio Perez will race alongside Max Verstappen at Red Bull next season, the Formula One team said Friday.
 Perez, who will replace Alexander Albon, became Mexico's first F1 winner in 50 years with his victory this month at the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain.
 Red Bull said that historic performance helped make Perez the "favored choice" over Albon, who will remain with the team as a test and reserve driver. Perez has a one-year contract.
 "Having taken our time to evaluate all the relevant data and performances we have decided that Sergio is the right driver to partner Max for 2021 and look forward to welcoming him to Red Bull Racing," team principal Christian Horner said.
 The 30-year-old Perez was facing an uncertain future after Racing Point announced in September that it would replace him with four-time F1 champion Sebastian Vettel.
 Perez is coming off his best F1 season, finishing with 125 points in fourth place. Albon was seventh with 105 points.
 In his 190th race, Perez earned his first win on Dec. 6 in Bahrain. Even then, he wasn't sure of his future, saying "if I'm not on the grid next year, I will be in 2022."
 He won't need to wait. Red Bull said Perez is "one of the sport's most consistent performers and tenacious racers." Perez was with Racing Point, which will be renamed Aston Martin, for seven seasons after making his debut in 2011.
 The 24-year-old Albon had joined Red Bull in August 2019, replacing Pierre Gasly. The Britain-born Thai racer made his F1 debut that season with Toro Rosso.
 "Alex is a valued member of the team and we thought long and hard about this decision," Horner said.
 "Alex remains an important part of our team as test and reserve driver with a key focus on 2022 development and we would like to thank him for his hard work and contribution." (AP)

The European Union wants to build 40 gigawatts of green hydrogen electrolyzers by 2030, and estimates that 80 to 120 gigawatts of solar and wind will be needed to power them.
 That's a fresh headache for Europe's grid operators. Decarbonization is expected to double the demand for electricity as transport and heat electrify directly as well.
 Taking hydrogen production off the power grid could be a win-win solution to these problems. That's the idea behind plans for 'islanded' hydrogen, which would pair electrolyzers with offshore wind farms and send hydrogen molecules, rather than electrons, back to shore.
 The AquaVentus consortium, led by German utility RWE, is exploring the deployment of up to 10 GW of islanded green hydrogen by 2035 with the island of Heligoland as a central hub. That makes it the largest green hydrogen proposal on the drawing board thus far. Other AquaVentus partners include Siemens Energy, Vattenfall, Vestas, Siemens Gamesa and Shell.
 AquaVentus dwarves the 4 GW plans in Saudi Arabia, although that project, in the new megacity Neom, plans to be up and running in 2025.
 Industry will be a big source of demand for hydrogen, even more so in the early days. In Europe, that means clusters of demand in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. Hydrogen piped back from AquaVentus would land downriver from the port of Hamburg.
 The costs of transporting hydrogen from ocean platforms via pipeline may appear at first glance to be much greater than the costs of laying undersea transmission to carry electricity to shore. But that doesn't take into account the cost of offshore substations to collect wind farm power, or the severely congested state of the onshore power grid. A massive coordinated effort will be needed to whip those grids into shape to absorb the rapidly growing amount of offshore wind power being planned.

Mumbai, Dec 18 (PTI) The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme launched to boost local manufacturing may add USD 520 billion to the gross domestic product in the next five years, according to a report.
 The government had in March announced the PLI scheme to help lower the country's dependence on imports, mainly from China, by incentivising and inviting global as well as capital-rich companies to set up manufacturing capacities in the country.
 If materialised, the move will help cut imports on one hand and boost exports on the other.
 "The PLI scheme may add around USD 520 billion to the GDP in the next five years," domestic brokerage Sharekhan by PNB Paribas said in a note.
 The scheme is applicable for 10 select sectors, which are labour-intensive and expected to cater to the growing employment needs and achieving size and scale in manufacturing.
 As part of the scheme, the government has made a budgetary outlay of Rs 1.96 lakh crore or USD 26 billion.
 The scheme envisages providing on average 5 per cent of the production value as an incentive. This implies that minimum production as a result of the scheme stands to be around USD 520 billion over the next five years, says the report.
 The idea is to create a few large manufacturing players with the advantage of policy support to the tune of 5-8 per cent of value add, scale and world-class technology.
 According to analysts, electronics, particularly mobile phone manufacturers, stand to be the biggest beneficiary of the scheme. Other sectors that will benefit include automobile, battery, pharma, food, textiles and telecom.
 If taken off as planned, the scheme could boost exports, thus narrowing the trade deficit by USD 55 billion.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court has dismissed as premature a challenge to President Donald Trump’s plan to exclude people living in the country illegally from the population count used to allot states seats in the House of Representatives. But the court’s decision Friday may not be its last word on the matter and it’s not clear whether Trump will receive numbers from the Census Bureau before he leaves office next month. The high court said it was too soon to rule on the legality of Trump’s plan because it’s not yet clear how many people he would seek to exclude and whether the division of House seats would be affected.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Sweden's government wants divers to go down to the wreck of one of Europe’s deadliest peacetime maritime disasters, the sinking of a ferry in the Baltic Sea in 1994 that killed 852 people, in order to check claims of a large hole in the hull. A 1997 report had concluded that the M/S Estonia _ that was sailing from Tallinn to Stockholm _ sank after the bow door locks failed in a storm, and flatly rejected the theory of a hole, which has long been the focus of speculate on about a possible explosion on board. Sweden's home affairs minister said on Friday that the government wants divers to investigate, but gave no timeline for an official dive.

In suggesting that there be a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode, Oliver Dowden also suggests that it would be detrimental to the royal family should the events be taken literally. He exposes one of the fundamental flaws of monarchy – its fragility. If a re-telling of the royal families lives in a Netflix series has to be criticised by a member of parliament for its inaccuracies because it may be dangerous to the reputation of certain members of the household – then perhaps the family is much too frail. It should also be noted that the show had run for three seasons before Dowden called for this disclaimer to be placed at the beginning of each episode, the difference perhaps being that the events which are depicted are too close to home?

Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall was born in 1934 in Hampstead, London. As a child, as an alternative to a teddy bear, Goodall’s father gave her a stuffed chimpanzee named Jubilee, and she carried it with her everywhere. Goodall has said her fondness for this figure started her early love of animals. “My mother’s friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares,” she recalls. Today, Jubilee still sits on Goodall’s dresser in London.

On any project, finding people who have a similar sense of pride, passion and a commitment to quality is paramount, says Fenton. But, it’s equally important to find people with a different perspective, and that’s where Williams comes in, he adds. “For us, it was a perfect match of bringing together people with different mindsets, so we could see how to create something out of the box.”
