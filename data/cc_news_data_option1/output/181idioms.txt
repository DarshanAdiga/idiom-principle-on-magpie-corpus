The St. Helena boys varsity basketball team had no answer for Cloverdale's star center Tuesday night, falling 74-54 at home to drop to 0-4 in North Central League I play.
 Josh Lemley, a 6-foot-6 junior and a returning all-league player for the Eagles (13-2, 4-0 NCL I), was a force inside. He finished the night with 32 points, 16 rebounds and 7 blocks.
 St. Helena (6-7, 0-4 NCL I) hung tough with the Eagles to the tune of a 17-17 first quarter, but Lemley helped the Eagles pull away in the second. The visitors outscored the Saints 22-8, with 16 of those points coming from Lemley.

 Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart have been hit with a barrage of criticism from India's brick-and-mortar retailers who accuse the U.S. giants of violating Indian law with deep discounts and discriminating against small sellers by promoting select big ones. The companies deny the allegations.

Tension soared following a U.S. drone strike early this month that killed a top Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani, and senior Iraq milita commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Iran retaliated by firing a barrage of missiles that hit two bases in Iraq where American troops are based, but caused no casualties. Tensions soared further after Iran, just hours following the missile attacks, mistakenly shot down an Ukrainian passenger plane that had taken off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board.

A cardinal-red front door opens onto a dramatic foyer, with the living room on the right, dining room on the left, and a classic staircase straight ahead, zigzagging upstairs. The ceiling in the foyer extends all the way up to the second floor, with a heavy wood banister that curves gently out of sight. An alcove under the sloped stairwell creates the perfect nook for an entryway bench. This combination of high-ceilinged spaciousness plus cozy intimacy blends comfortably to set a welcoming tone and hint at the treasures to come.

What I try to do is think about the audience. For Taron Egerton, I know that basically everyone has probably seen Rocketman, so I can really dig deep into specific scenes and moments because I know the audience will know what I’m talking about. If it’s Aldis Hodge and the movie is Clemency, which probably 5 percent of the audience will have seen by the time I’m interviewing him, then I know I need to be a little bit more broad in my questioning and not too specific, because then no one will know what I’m talking about. Those are the kinds of things that I try to think about when I’m doing the questions, and because I only have six or seven minutes with each person, I really try to be very targeted to elicit the most interesting answers.

Out of the 18 blocks, tenants in nine blocks have been offered two-year lease extensions - namely, blocks 8, 8D, 9, 9A, 9B, 10, 11, 13, 13A.
 These blocks house familiar names such as seafood restaurant Jumbo Seafood, Mexican eatery Margarita’s, Australian cafe Jones the Grocer and art space Redsea Gallery.
 They are also home to furniture stores such as Woody Antique House, Hedger’s Carpet Gallery and Maywell Lifestyles.
 Tenants who CNA spoke to were pleased about being able to stay, citing the precinct’s spaciousness, unique tenant mix and relaxed atmosphere as key draws.
 Such large units with relatively high footfall is also ideal for selling furniture, said one home decor shop owner, who declined to be named.  
 However, some tenants see the two-year lifeline as merely kicking the can down the road.

Celui-ci a demarre en 1986, avec la selection a la Quinzaine des realisateurs de _Nola Darling n'en fait qu' a sa tete_, le premier-long metrage du cineaste, qui repartit avec le Prix de la jeunesse. Mais c'est reellement avec son incursion cannoise suivante que Spike Lee est entre dans la legende.
 Situe dans le quartier de Bedford-Stuyvesant a Brooklyn, _Do the Right Thing_ s'inspire d'une tragedie parmi tant d'autres: la mort de Michael Griffith, jeune homme noir renverse par une voiture en 1986, alors qu'il tentait d'echapper a un groupe d'assaillants blancs qui s'en etaient pris a lui et a ses amis. Le scenario du film est finalement assez eloigne du deroulement de ce drame, meme si les violences liees au racisme en sont l'une des thematiques principales.
 Le film se deroule durant la canicule, idee inspiree a Spike Lee par un episode de la serie _Alfred Hitchcock pr esente_, dont les protagonistes insistaient sur le fait que de fortes temperatures favorisent les tensions et alimentent les comportements violents. Les evenements filmes dans _Do the Right Thing_ se deroulent le plus souvent aux alentours de la pizzeria tenue par Sal. Danny Aiello, mort en decembre 2019, fut nomme a l'Oscar pour le role de ce restaurateur travaillant avec ses deux fils, dont l'un (joue par John Turturro) est ouvertement raciste alors que la quasi-totalite de la clientele de Sal est noire.
 Au sein de la galerie de personnages qui frequentent la pizzeria ou y travaille, il a aussi Mookie, livreur de pizzas un peu tire-au-flanc interprete par Spike Lee lui-meme. _Do the Right Thing_ aurait pu se contenter d'etre un film choral, aussi nerveux que joyeux, mais c'est sans compter l'irreversible escalade de violence qui se deploiera dans le dernier acte, faute d'apaisement possible.
