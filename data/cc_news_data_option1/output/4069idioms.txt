 Ward joined Blackpool at the end of 2019 having been released by the Blues the previous summer, with a knee ligament injury suffered on Boxing Day 2018 bringing his time at the club to an end.
 He took his time to find his feet and regain full fitness after signing for the Seasiders, but he’s now become a regular in Neil Critchley’s side, operating on the right of a central midfield three.
 He’s likely to start against his old side this afternoon and admitted he has an added desire to do well and prove to manager Paul Lambert that releasing him was the wrong decision.
 “The longer your career goes on, the more likely it is you’re going to play against one of your old teams at some point,” Ward told The Gazette ahead of the game.

 “It will be nice to see some familiar faces but I think it also gives you an extra incentive to do well, you want to beat them, prove the manager wrong or things like that.
 “I think I’m motivated the same for every game anyway but when you’re on the pitch it might give you that extra bit of drive, we’ll have to see.
 “It’s two teams who probably shouldn’t be at this level. Both teams will be wanting to do well this season, so it should be a good game.”

Washington conservation district supervisors and managers are being asked whether they want the Department of Fish and Wildlife to become a voting member of the State Conservation Commission.
 The survey, due back Oct. 30, will help the commission make a recommendation to the Legislature on whether to change the commission's makeup.
 Commissioners elected by conservation districts already are a minority on the 10-member board.
 Three state departments and Washington State University are represented. Two members are named by Gov. Jay Inslee. He appointed representatives of environmental groups and tribes.
 Four commissioners are elected by the 45 conservation districts and include the president of the Washington Association of Conservation Districts.
 "One may wish to consider how the addition of another representative will fit within this balance," according to a notice sent by the state commission staff to conservation districts.
 Conservation districts in Washington date back to the 1930s. They are charged with conserving soil and water quality, including to protect fish and wildlife, through voluntary projects with landowners. The state commission oversees the operations and finances of conservation districts.
 Fish and Wildlife serves as a non-voting adviser to the state commission.
 In a letter to the commission, Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind said that since half the state is privately owned, the department can't preserve fish and wildlife unless it works with private landowners.
 Susewind acknowledged some people might be concerned about adding another state agency. He said he supported adding other voting members to balance the commission.
 The survey that the state commission sent to conservation districts poses several options:
 • Add just Fish and Wildlife.
 • Add Fish and Wildlife and another conservation district representative.
 • Add Fish and Wildlife and a representative of urban or small acreage agriculture.
 • Add Fish and Wildlife and a tribal representative.
 The state Department of Agriculture, Department of Ecology and Department of Natural Resources are represented on the commission, as is WSU's dean of the agriculture college.

Delta crashed onshore Friday night near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana.In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack’s bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp covering his roof since Laura damaged his home hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.“It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.”Delta hit with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. Within two hours of hitting land, it had dwindled to a Category 1 storm with 85 mph (140 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge that could reach up to 11 feet (3.4 meters). Flash flood warnings were posted for much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.In the town of Lake Arthur, Delta’s winds peeled shingles off the roof of L’Banca Albergo Hotel, an eight-room boutique hotel in what used to be a bank.“I probably don’t have a shingle left on the top of this hotel,” owner Roberta Palermo said as the winds gusted outside.Palermo said the electricity was out and she could see pieces of metal coming off the roof of a 100-year-old building across the street. Unsecured trash cans were flying around the streets.“There is a lot of power lines down all over the place, there’s ... really deep water in certain spots,” said hotel guest Johnny Weaver. He had been out in the weather with his friends earlier and the friend’s car was stranded in the water.Delta’s reach stretched as far west as Galveston, Texas, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from where the storm struck Louisiana. Two homes under construction were toppled by winds, as were some trees and signs in the area. Beach dunes flattened by earlier storms allowed storm surge to reach beneath some of Galveston’s raised beach houses.Power outages in Louisiana and neighboring Texas soared past 410,000 homes and businesses Friday within hours of the storm coming ashore, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, made the record books when it struck the Gulf Coast. It was the first Greek-alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental U.S. And it became the 10th named storm to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a century-old record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.Forecasters predicted Delta would be downgraded to a tropical storm overnight. The storm’s projected path showed it moving into northern Mississippi on Saturday and then into the Tennessee Valley as a tropical depression.Delta was the fourth named storm to strike Louisiana in 2020. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip just three days before Laura struck. And Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.Some who rode out Laura chose to hunker down again with Delta. In Lafayette, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Lake Charles, Jeanne-Marie Gove could hear debris hitting the front door of her apartment Friday night and her patio gate banging open and shut.“The wind is much worse than what Hurricane Laura brought,” Gove said in a message on Twitter.The roof from a trailer at the mobile home park behind her apartment was torn off and being tossed down the sidewalk.“The wind gusts are making the glass from our windows bow inward,” Gove added. “It’s pretty scary.”__Plaisance reported from New Iberia, Louisiana.

One man’s unshakable belief in the Constitution underpins the timely “Hold These Truths,” being streamed by TheatreWorks Silicon Valley as part of its online initiative, “Voices of Democracy,” an effort to encourage voting and racial justice.
 Jeanne Sakata based her play on the true story of Gordon Hirabayashi (Joel de la Fuente), a second-generation Japanese American who defied the curfew and subsequent internment of Japanese people as security threats during World War II.
 Because of his defiance, he was imprisoned. The Supreme Court upheld his internment conviction, but it was invalidated by a federal district court judge in Seattle in 1986.
 The judge held that the U.S. government had withheld crucial information that a widespread roundup of Japanese people — both aliens and citizens — wasn’t a military necessity.
 In May 2012, President Obama awarded Gordon the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.
 Besides believing in the freedoms outlined in the Constitution, Gordon believed these words in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence:
 “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
 His immigrant parents owned a farm in Washington, so Gordon worked there before going to the University of Washington in Seattle in 1937. While there he became a Quaker, or Friend. Thus he was a pacifist, too.
 Although he liked college and made friends, including his future wife, he was limited in where he could go because so many places had signs stating, “No Japs.”
 This anti-Japanese racism intensified after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. As far as many Americans were concerned, “Our faces are the faces of the enemy,” Gordon says. Japanese people had to adhere to an 8 p.m. curfew, which he defied.
 In May 1942, he also defied the internment over his parents’ strenuous objections. He was arrested for both violations and ultimately spent 90 days in jail.
 Playing Gordon, de la Fuente voices other characters in a tour de force using only three chairs and some minimal props.
 Directed by Lisa Rothe, this streamed version was filmed during an actual performance in 2018. Hence it feels more authentic than Zoom shows. The only drawback is that its occasional background radio broadcasts don’t carry over on film.
 As Gordon says late in the play, the district court in Seattle found that “ancestry is not a crime.”
 These words strike a chord today as the nation grapples with racism along with some leaders’ seeming defiance of the Constitution among other crises of 2020.
 In addition to this play, “Voices of Democracy” offers digital theatrical experiences leading up to the election. They include poems read by local actors and other features.
 In another highlight, TheatreWorks is teaming with Berkeley Repertory Theatre and other companies across the Bay Area and nation for a four-part radio adaptation of Sinclair Lewis’ “It Can’t Happen Here” starting at 5 p.m. Oct. 13 on YouTube.
 This 1935 satire follows the ascent of a demagogue who becomes president by promising to return the country to greatness.
 For information about all events, call (650) 463-1960 or visit theatreworks.org.
 “Hold These Truths” continues on-demand streaming through Nov. 3. Access is available on a sliding scale ($10-$100). Closed captions are available in English and Japanese.

For shoes, pumps, slingbacks, ballet flats, or running shoes in solid neutrals, such as cream, navy or black, are your best bet. All go with a multitude of outfits.

We are all too familiar with the seasonal patterns of some respiratory viruses and now scientists suggest that Covid-19, the illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, will likely follow suit and become seasonal in countries with temperate climates, but only when herd immunity is attained.   Until that time, Covid-19 will continue to circulate across the seasons. These conclusions published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, highlight the absolute importance of public health measures needed just now to control the virus. (IANS)

While numerous events have been canceled or postponed -- sometimes more than once -- because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Arizona Bike Week is currently underway at WestWorld of Scottsdale, one of the first large-scale events to be approved.
 The yearly event is typically held in the spring, but was postponed because of the pandemic.
 In order to be given approval to continue with the event, organizers had to make a number of changes and requirements, including moving the event entirely outside, requiring masks, and canceling some events, such as the charity rides.
 "We kind of got rid of the things that would be difficult for us to control the distancing," said Lisa Cyr, vice president of FX Production, which helped organize and produce the event.
 The five-day event typically draws 70,000 people, but this year, they're expecting fewer than half of that, roughly 20,000 people. The City of Scottsdale required daily attendance to be limited to a maximum of 4,200 people.
 The nightly concerts, one of the traditional highlights of the week-long event, are on. Organizers used barricades to spread fans out into private sections.
 "Private boxes that hold nine people so we're sticking to guidelines of groups of less than 10 and there's a table in each section," said Cyr.
 Police officers and private security guards are also inside the event to make sure people wear their masks and follow all the health and safety guidelines.
 While different, a few attendees told ABC15 that they were not going to miss this year's event.
 "I wasn't going to let this keep me at home," said Rod Paschke, who has attended the event every year since 2020. "Getting away, being around motorcycles, it's an 800-mile ride for me. That part I love," he said. "[The] warm weather of Arizona and just great people. It's a lot of fun."
 "It's very scaled-down. It's very not what I'm used to," said Joey Alessi, who rode in from California. "The mask thing is pretty ridiculous. But like I said, it's better than nothing, and I'm going to have a great time anyways.
 "We're protecting ourselves and others in the process," said Tom Gregor, of California. "The regulations are quite clear in the clubs we may go into and it all makes sense to me."
 The event runs through Sunday.

If China is excluded for the time being, the Trump administration would be wise to keep Beijing in the loop. Even in the best-case scenario, negotiations are likely to be protracted. Sustaining maximum pressure on North Korea through sanctions, which was likely a factor in Kim's outreach to Seoul and his offer to meet with Trump, will require continued Chinese cooperation.
