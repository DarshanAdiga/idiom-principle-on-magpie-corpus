So every now and again I see something that is Not Done and I wonder why. Some things in our culture, especially in the South, have weird rules that everyone follows even though it doesn't make sense. For example, one of the most uncouth things a Southerner can do is to bring storebought potato salad to a potluck dinner. I mean, I don't care if it's the kind with bacon and Greek dressing that I could eat a whole bowlful of by myself, it's just Not Done. If you can't cook at all, you bring napkins and paper plates or something, but you just don't bring something from the Kroger Deli.      One of those things pertains to catfish in the South. Catfish is to be rolled in cornmeal and deep fried at about 375 degrees until it floats, and that's it. If you want to be high-fallutin' about it, you can put some spices in the corn meal, or maybe squeeze a lemon over it, but that's it. There is simply no other way of cooking catfish.      So of course when I wound up with some on sale at the meat counter, I decided I had to bake it.      Zatarans seasoning, fine ground corn meal, and some spray-on oil, and so much less mess and it's fantastic.      Anyway, take the Quiz, and come back and tell us if there's something you like to cook in an unusual way.      Winners and Easiest/Hardest from last week are in the NotNewsletter.      Don't forget the Easy Quiz!      Good luck, and let me know if you have any issues.

DURANT - Southeastern Oklahoma State University reports that it experienced record-setting enrollment this fall despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
   
 The university enrolled 5,339 students for the fall 2020 semester, marking the largest enrollment in its 111-year history.
   
 The number represents a 10.7 percent increase over the fall 2019 enrollment number of 4,824 students.
   
 Student credit hours are also up 6.7 percent over last fall.
   
 Enrollment at Southeastern increased 2.6 percent among undergraduate students and 25.8 percent for graduate students.
   
 "This continued enrollment growth is a direct result of the efforts of our faculty and staff,'' Southeastern president Thomas Newsom said. "They deserve a lot of credit, not only for ensuring a smooth transition to virtual learning last March, but for planning and preparing for a return to face-to-face instruction this fall."
   
 The graduate-level master of education and business administration programs, as well as the master of science in sports administration and Native American Leadership programs experienced significant growth, as did undergraduate occupational safety and health programs.
   
 Newsom also credits Southeastern's affordability for the uptick in enrollment. For a third consecutive year, the school did not raise tuition or related fees, nor room-and-board charges.
   
 Eighty-five percent of students at the university receive some form of financial aid.
   
 "In light of the challenges our students and their families have faced dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe holding the line on costs is the right thing to do,'' Newsom said.
   
 "From a revenue and budget standpoint, we are fortunate to be in a good position due to our sustained enrollment growth over the last three years. It is also important to note that our budget continues to support those services directly impacting academics and student success.''
   
 Southeastern previously announced this fall that it would offer a $1,500 tuition waiver for all first-time, full-time freshmen hailing from Oklahoma. It also awarded an automatic Associate Tuition Waiver Scholarship of $1,000 per semester to students who hold an Associate of Arts or Science degree.
   
 The school also made available seven Regional University Baccalaureate Scholarships, which provided full tuition plus $3,000 per year toward expenses for four years. Meanwhile, it expanded a policy providing all out-of-state undergraduate and graduate students an automatic 100 percent non-resident tuition waiver each semester.
   
 The university also distributed funds to students as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
   
 Newsom said accessibility has also had a role in the university's record growth, noting dramatic changes in the higher education model in recent years.
   
 "We will continue to be responsive to the needs of our students," he said.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I have a theory that there are two types of messy bun in this world.
 First, there's the painstakingly crafted messy bun.
 It is, obviously, an illusion. Brushed into place, pinned, pulled, taken out a minimum of 14 times, before settling on something that will 'do for now'. The result of YouTube tutorials and celebrity recommendations (hey, Molly Mae), all in pursuit of that "Oh, this old bun? With these effortless tendrils? Just chucked it up, babe" vibe.
 It's a heartbreaking endeavour, usually resulting in something contrived and 6/10. It is, sadly, our collective daily messy bun fate.
 But then there's number two - the miracle messy bun. Usually done without a mirror, thrown up while trying to eat spaghetti (just me?), though very often a just-before-bed twist while cleansing over a sink.
 And, heartbreakingly, because such buns are unplanned, they're usually a wasted gift from the hair gods that nobody will ever see.
 But once in a while, the stars align and a miracle messy bun, with tumbling baby hairs and beachy textures and that Just Right amount of volume comes along - and there's someone there to witness it.
 And we're gathered here today, to celebrate that once-in-a-lifetime moment for Jennifer Lopez. Jlo, who's had a wild ride of late, hair-wise. Jlo with chunky highlights, who dabbles in space buns. Jlo with the 90's bombshell hairstyle (which was inspired, by the way, via 90s Barbie.
 Jlo who, on this day, lay her rockin' bod on a beach, wrapped up her natural curls into a messy bun, and by the grace of god, was lucky enough to have her photo taken as proof.  
 The salty, beachy textures. The windswept wisps, catching an evening breeze. The perfect placement of the peak of the bun, balancing her facial proportions more carefully than a Renaissance painting. That perfect, free little tendril at the nape of her neck. The absolute absence of bobby pins or mismatched hair ties.

This is attributed to the high demand for alumina in electronics and electrical, automotive, energy and utility, and other industries. The non-oxide segment, on the other hand, would cite the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. Being an excellent abrasive material, these ceramics are increasingly used in grinding wheels application, which has boosted the segment growth.

LICK TOWNSHIP — The 2020 Jackson Apple Festival may have been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but that didn’t stop one local organization from churning out a beloved apple festival favorite.
 For almost 70 years, members of the Victory Grange have gathered to make apple butter at the annual festival, but this year is a little different.
 On Saturday, Sept. 12, the members of the Victory Grange, along with help from the Kiwanis Club, cooked apple butter at the grange in a total of three large kettles all over an open flame.
 The Courier caught up with Larry Johnson, the current Master of the Victory Grange, to discuss the plans for the local tradition dating back to 1951.
 Johnson explained that the plan is to sell the apple butter this year at the Jackson Farmers’ Market located on Harding Avenue in Jackson. The Farmers Market is open every Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
 The Victory Grange will be at the market beginning Saturday, Sept. 19, and will continue to show up each Saturday after until they sell out.
 Johnson said they will have apple butter available in pint or quart canning jars, however, quart jars are limited this year due to the difficulty of finding jars. Quarts will cost $8 and the pints will be $5. He explained that he had several past customers calling and asking about buying apple butter, so they decided to make it this year.
 The Victory Grange, according to Johnson, used to be a co-op organization. In days past, the group would buy dictionaries for local schools. Nowadays the grange doesn’t do that, instead, they donate to different organizations or sometimes help someone when they are down and out.

Buchanan County has confirmed 1,506 cases with an additional 365 probable cases and 19 total deaths, including 33 total hospitalizations currently. The 14-day positive rate is at 8.26% with those under 20 making up 196 cases, and ages 20-29 adding 429.
 The St. Joseph City Council passed a city-wide mask mandate this week, while Buchanan County chose not to enforce one. The Midland Empire Conference, which includes Lafayette and Benton, is among the area leagues already enforcing masks indoors and when social distancing isn’t possible at other events.
 “We were kind of ahead of the curve as far as what we were doing with our fans indoors,” Sigrist said. “I think people understand we’re trying to find that balance as opposed to not far away from us where parents aren’t able to attend at all. We’re fortunate to be able to provide some level of viewing for our fans.”
 Athletics will continue to ramp up as fall sports near the postseason in November as winter sports practices begin. With no days guaranteed, Sigrist feels those in the area aren’t taking competition for granted and are committed to preventing further hiccups.
 “We have to continue to take it day by day. You hope that some of the things that are being put in place in the community will help with the spread,” Sigrist said. “We’re gonna continue to do the best we can. We’re into Week 4 of competition at this point. There’s a time we didn’t think we’d get in four weeks. In a sense, that’s a victory for our kids.”
