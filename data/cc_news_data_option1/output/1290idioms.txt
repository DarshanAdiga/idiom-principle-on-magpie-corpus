But even the most optimistic projections are troublesome.
 The DNC has the legal right to use the Fiserv Forum, the home arena of the Milwaukee Bucks, during the four scheduled days of the convention, July 13-16. But the agreement stipulates that convention planners can’t begin retrofitting the 17,000-seat venue until after the Bucks are finished in the playoffs — which, if the NBA’s season restarts, could last into mid-July. The team had the best record in the league when the season was suspended.
 Past national conventions have required three to four weeks to build stages and turn arenas used for basketball and hockey into a setting made for a nationally televised political extravaganza.
 “If we’re fortunate enough to host the convention and playoffs, we’ll figure out how to make it work,” said Alex Lasry, a senior Bucks official who led Milwaukee’s convention bid. “These will be two of our biggest events, so we’re going to figure it out, make them successful and put Milwaukee on the map.”
 Rewriting a convention plan on the fly is far easier for a party with a presumptive nominee and no possibility of challenges on the floor, which can be pesky issues under normal circumstances. Trump’s allies on the RNC have seen to it over his three years in office that anyone who might be a dissenting voice in Charlotte — where the NBA team that plays in the convention arena is far out of playoff contention — is kept away from important roles in the party or its convention.
 “The 2020 Republican convention is going to be the coronation of Trump,” said Scott Reed, senior political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who also directed preparations for the Republican convention in 1996.
 Reed said he saw little downside to hosting a virtual convention, if it comes to that.

Lapschies is the kind of dad who bought an obsessed 10-year-old Brown a little brown horse for $60 and set her on her lifelong love of horses. He bought her a rundown 1939 Mercury coupe when she was 16.
 The two “worked and worked on that thing” until it was drivable, Brown said, and she kept the car through high school.
 The entire family’s love of the outdoors, Brown said, traces back to Lapschies, who took his two daughters and wife camping — often with a slew of neighborhood kids tagging along – at a time when spending a few days in the woods wasn’t yet all the rage. She remembers the Army-issue tents they slept in and the smelly Army sleeping bags.
 Brown and her family are Lapschies' main support system now. Deanie Lapschies died in 2001 from ovarian cancer; Billie Jean also died of ovarian cancer in 1998.
 Brown is looking forward to the day when she can finally get into the veterans home to see him without glass between them.
 The first thing she’ll do is give him a big hug, she said. Next order of business: giving him a haircut.

Both men graduated from Mason County Eastern High School in 1983, and both loved to play. In particular, they loved to play basketball. They were both among four starters set to return for the 1982-83 Cardinals, and Russell points out that the only reason it wasn't five was that the fifth starter had been hurt the prior season, when the team went, by Zweigle's recollection, 13-7. Earlier in Zweigle's career, the Cards had been unbeaten going into the state tournament when he was pulled up to the varsity; they ultimately lost a double-overtime classic to then-powerhouse Western Michigan Christian.
 The Cards were set to be loaded again in '82-'83. Jeff Tyndall, whose family produces players to this day at Mason County Central, and Zweigle each scored around 20 points per game, and Zweigle in fact went on to play for a season as a walk-on at Division II Lake Superior State. Two other starters on that team were also great athletes that went on to collegiate track and field. Russell was the fifth guy; as he jokingly puts it, "There's only one basketball, and I got to touch it occasionally."
 But in August 1982, those dreams were snatched away. It was a rough time financially for many, as America's economy hadn't yet fully rebounded from a late-1970s recession. MCE's budget, having seen a millage request fail on the ballot that summer, was one of many that suffered. Russell's father had just left his position as superintendent of schools to work at the intermediate school district, and the cash-strapped school promoted Grant Griswold, who at the time had no administrative experience, to the superintendent's job. It then immediately gave him the thankless task of figuring out how to make the numbers work.
 "The knee-jerk reaction was just to cut everything that wasn't academic," Russell said. "He was probably acting on less than good information, and he and the board decided to make some drastic cuts to the district. He decided prior to the school year to cut all sports for the year."
 It was a move that stunned many, including the coaches. Russell said each of them turned up at the next school board meeting and volunteered en masse to forgo the year's salaries to save the sports teams. Zweigle said that local parents got together and offered to raise the money for sports themselves. At that point, though, the decision was made and there was no going back; Zweigle said that the school feared that if it allowed such measures, it would decrease support for future millage requests. (The move created bad blood; Russell said that, to his recollection, all the school's coaches declined to return the following year when sports were restored.)
 "When those types of decisions are made, kids of high school or middle school age just don't comprehend looking past the end of their nose, and they think that decision is unfair," Russell said. "I just remember that feeling as a kid. I felt so slighted and didn't have control of those things. We'd worked so hard for so many years to get to the point we were."
 Almost 40 years later, you can still hear the frustration in Zweigle's voice when he talks about it.
 "I was devastated that it got taken away," Zweigle said. "It was kind of surreal. I didn't really believe it was going to happen. All along I believed it would change and they would reinstate sports.
 "I don't like to talk about myself, but I was a pretty good basketball player...I think we would've run into Western Michigan Christian or something (at some point in the state tournament), but we had a pretty good team."

Doosan Bobcat announced today it will shut down its Minnesota and North Dakota manufacturing facilities from April 6-20 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The announcement is a result of the pandemic's effect on the global economy, according to a company news release. Uncertain business conditions and supply chain disruptions, as well as continuing preventive measures to protect employees and communities, all played a role in the decision.
 “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt operations and is changing our way of life and how we work together,” said Doosan Bobcat North American President Mike Ballweber. “We are taking steps to respond to these changes brought on by this unprecedented crisis, as well as protecting our employees and preserving the strength of our businesses.”
 Doosan Bobcat announced late last year it planned a massive expansion at its facility in Litchfield. The $26 million expansion was expected to create 200 new jobs at the plant.
 The company said it is closely monitoring inventory levels, though the supply of available products is adequate to meet current orders and market demand. Doosan Bobcat will also continue to provide support and services to meet the needs of dealers and customers during this temporary suspension of production.
 To protect the health and safety of employees, Doosan Bobcat has put in place a variety of preventive measures. This includes travel restrictions, remote working where possible, social distancing practices, increased cleaning and disinfecting of facilities, limited visitor access and other necessary steps, all of which remain in effect.
 Doosan Bobcat will continue to follow all guidelines and directions from state and federal governments, with the goal of limiting the spread of the virus and its consequences to the communities in which it operates. The company will continue to monitor the situation and adjust plans, as necessary.

State Sen. Bob Gardner is blasting the legislature for not taking action to close a "loophole" in Colorado's speedy trial clock that he says could lead to murderers and other criminals going free.
 In a statement released Monday evening, Gardner cited a Gazette report about William Camacho Jr., a Colorado Springs murder suspect, pressing to have his case heard by a legally mandated April 22 speedy trial deadline despite a judge’s safety concerns about jurors being exposed to COVID-19.
 Prosecutors fear that if a judge postpones Camacho’s April 13 trial over the defendant’s objection, any potential conviction could be overturned on the ground that he was deprived of his right to a trial within six months of being arraigned.

"We remain committed to helping ensure key medical supplies expeditiously arrive at the front lines for our health care workers," Montesi said.
 According to the White House, FEMA had shipped or delivered 11.6 million N95 respirator masks, 26 million surgical masks, 5.2 million face shields, 4.3 million surgical gowns, 22 million gloves, and 8,100 ventilators as of March 28.
 A stockpile of 1.5 million expired N95 masks that U.S. Customs and Border Protection has in storage will be distributed to the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, CBP said in a statement. The CDC has issued guidelines for the safe use of masks with expiration dates that have passed, potentially leaving their elastic bands too loose to form a proper face seal.
 U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., said this week she and other lawmakers were told some of the expired CBP masks would be given to hospitals.
 "Officials confirmed that the masks would indeed go to health care workers and be prioritized by highest need such as NY and NJ. I will follow up to make sure this happens!" the lawmaker tweeted Sunday.
 A CBP official on Wednesday confirmed to The Washington Post that the masks would go to ICE agents and TSA officers instead, not to FEMA staff or medical personnel.
 The government has long viewed the national stockpile supples as a holdover during an emergency so the government could buy time for manufacturers to boost output and for new supply chains to solidify, according to a senior administration official. Having the medical supplies sitting in a warehouse doesn't serve any purpose, the official said, even though the administration has been holding back thousands of ventilators.
 Asked about concerns that the government will not be able to keep pace with the demand for PPE supplies, the official said the government has planes coming in from Asia every day for the next few weeks ferrying new materials, noting that a planeload with 80 tons of PPE arrived from China on Sunday.

Perhaps it slipped past you amid the chaos of life over the last few weeks. On March 15, when NFL players voted to approve a new collective bargaining agreement, they gave the green light for playoff expansion this year. Two more teams in the bracket, one per conference. One fewer first-round bye.
 NFL teams formally approved that proposal during league meetings Tuesday. So it’s full steam ahead.
 That’s right, in 2020 the playoff guest list expands to 14 teams, almost 44% of the league now joining the party.
 So what will that mean in Chicago? Will it change the pressure inside Halas Hall for an organization that hasn’t won a playoff game since 2010 and has played in only three over the last 13 seasons?

The global outbreak of the coronavirus has changed the way Americans conduct business, for the time being at the least. Limited public access, social distancing and workplace restrictions have engendered a period of adjustment the likes of which we haven't seen since the Great Depression and World War II.
 Still, the opportunities exist for many companies to adapt to the "new normal" and maintain a solid level of productivity. Enter teleworking - having employees shift their operations to a home office during this public health crisis.
 Businesses that have implemented the practice of teleworking for years now are ahead of things in terms of integration, protocol and security. For those businesses with a longstanding culture of working within a "traditional" office setting, the following is a brief playbook to help integrate teleworking into their overall strategy.
 Virtual Private Network--Teleworking begins with a Virtual Private Network, or VPN - a tool that connects remote users to a company's private internal network by using the internet for connectivity. With cloud-based technology, VPNs can be relatively simple for a company to establish, providing they have the capacity to make it work company-wide.
 While a VPN can provide access to company resources, it may not be enough to enable a "useable" end-user experience. Some legacy applications are not well optimized to run over a VPN and the lack of responsiveness can be frustrating to end-users. Fortunately, there are solutions called Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) that provide a remote desktop experience. A VDI reduces the amount of bandwidth being consumed, allows the application to run within the secure confines of the business network, and provides a more responsive experience for the end-user.
 Ensuring Productivity--Once a VPN is established and employees can work from home, the business needs to develop a system of monitoring remote users to ensure productivity. Employees and employers can work together to determine what defines productivity and what level is expected while teleworking.
 Next, specify parameters for the home workspace; employers should stress the importance of an appropriate space and proper workplace etiquette. Make sure employees have the right tools--such as access to instant messaging and internal communication chains, headsets and hardware needed to operate properly.
 Security--Proper security is paramount for teleworking, given the persistent threat of cyber security attacks. Any changes to infrastructure to support remote work should include a review of the security approach to guard against an increase in potential exposure. All protocols followed by a company for on- site users--password protections, encryption, alertness to and notification of potential scams and more--must be in place in the home office as well. In fact, vigilance should be heightened as not all network traffic on the user's PC is necessarily protected by the corporate firewall.
 Telework has evolved into something much more than opening a laptop at the kitchen table; it should be viewed as a direct extension of the main office, with all compulsory rules and processes in place. During a time as extraordinary and uncertain as the one we presently find ourselves in, telework is a vital and valuable tool that can help businesses stay afloat, provide stability, and even grow.

Last week the Alachua County Commission issued a detailed 10-page order outlining the potential dangers of COVID-19 -- a serious respiratory illness characterized by rapid transmission that poses a "clear and present threat to the health, welfare, and safety of the people of Alachua County" and can cause death.
   
 As a result of the disease's spread in our community, the commissioners have directed businesses to close, prohibited citizens from gathering in groups of 10 or more and required people to return to their homes.
   
 Unfortunately, this edict apparently does not apply to one major player in this town - the Alachua County Jail. Instead, it remains open for business, housing inmates in large groups and preventing citizens from returning to the safety of their homes as directed by the commission. But continued incarceration of community members in the local jail is simply cruel, unusual and inhumane treatment in the face of a deadly pandemic.
   
 This is especially so given the jail's recent mysterious quarantine, its contract with a notoriously troubled medical treatment provider and the continued indifference of criminal justice system actors who persist with a presumption of pre-trial imprisonment - even for minor offenses.
   
 The Alachua County Jail quietly began an internal lock down a few weeks ago because of health concerns within the facility. It was unclear how, exactly, decisions were being made or the population managed. But it appears entire units were deemed quarantined because of flu-like symptoms presented by inmates. The situation was so bad that many were denied the ability to go to court or see their attorneys.
   
 Making matters worse, Alachua County contracts with Corizon Health to provide medical services within the jail. But Corizon is well-known for its neglect toward patient care. They have been sued countless times for their failure to deliver appropriate treatment, including by this author in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of thousands of Missouri prisoners denied life-saving treatment for Hepatitis-C.
   
 Now it appears Corizon is incredibly short-staffed at the Alachua County Jail, with numerous postings seeking to fill empty nursing and other positions. If COVID-19 testing isn't available to most of us in the free world, it seems quite unlikely that this high-risk population is being widely tested while behind bars.
   
 And yet, system actors continue to cruelly pack the jail with inmates facing non-violent, low-level allegations or who are serving sentences of less than a year for misdemeanor conduct. For example, in the midst of our community's COVID-19 crisis, a woman was accused of climbing into her father's home, taking $16 from his wallet and stealing a single Subutex tablet.
   
 Subutex, however, is used to treat addiction and helps opiate abusers lead a sober lifestyle. So even if this was a crime, it appears to be one of desperation on the part of an addict seeking to stay drug-free -- surely not one that should receive a potential death sentence. But that is what happened in her case - and many others.
   
 In this case the woman was charged with felony burglary and then held at the jail on $5,000 bail. This occurred even though, quite unusually, the defendant's request for release on her own recognizance was not opposed by the prosecutor. Days later the judge did finally reduce bail to $2,500 - after she had already been housed with hundreds of other people at the jail.
   
 In addition, even $2,500 bail can easily result in the pre-trial detention of an indigent defendant for days, weeks or months. Thus because of their poverty many local defendants are being cruelly punished before even being found guilty - condemned to what is essentially a cement incubator for the spread of COVID-19, with hundreds of other persons similarly held.
   
 If Alachua County citizens are subject to an emergency order from county officials to help contain the spread of the coronavirus, our local criminal justice system should follow it too. Gainesville's practiced presumption of pre-trial incarceration is unconstitutional on any given day of the week. Right now, it is additionally cruel, unusual, inhumane - and might even be deadly.
   
 Absent the exceptional case, the Alachua County Jail should be closed for business until the COVID-19 crisis leaves our community.

 Absent the exceptional case, the Alachua County Jail should be closed for business until the COVID-19 crisis leaves our community.

Penn State crushed the over on its projected win total for the 2019 season, stringing together eight straight wins to start the season to climb into the fourth spot of the first College Football Playoff rankings.
 In light of Penn State’s massive off-season personnel overhaul, sending five early departures to the NFL while experiencing a mass exodus through the transfer portal, plus the normal graduation of its senior class, the success proved to be a surprise to many. Riding confident performances from quarterback Sean Clifford and an outstanding collective effort on the defensive side of the ball, in conjunction with a schedule that allowed for gradual development, Penn State couldn’t have asked for much more.
 And yet, a 31-26 loss at unbeaten Minnesota on Nov. 9, coming out of a bye week, created an undeniable sense of anticlimax.
 Unexpected as Penn State’s success might have been up until that point, with only the Gophers, Indiana, at Ohio State and Rutgers left on the schedule, even a probable loss to the unbeaten Buckeyes would have kept the Nittany Lions in the CFP conversation. Instead, the loss sent Penn State into the postseason with a 2-2 mark in its last four, leaving the Nittany Lions to settle for a Cotton Bowl date with Memphis, a 53-39 win that served as a national appetizer for the day’s CFP semifinal games later that evening.
 With more critical departures to the NFL this off-season, where does that leave Penn State heading into 2020?
