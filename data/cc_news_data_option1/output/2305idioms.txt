The hat I wear in the garden in July is not the one I want on a winter’s day in the mountains, and vice versa.
 I’m not really a hat guy anyway. I generally prefer caps. And caps have come a long way over the years. Remember when they used to be made of that weird foam material? Now they’re mostly cotton or canvas, which is a good thing.
 But there are times when a cap won’t suffice, this year being a good example — starting with the gnats.
 One morning walking in the woods this spring I started noticing gnats swarming around my face. It took several such walks before I gathered my wits and started wearing a hat. Gnats don’t like flying under hat brims.
 Then came the scorching sun. A wide-brimmed hat is a good insurance against skin cancer, not to mention sunburn.
 Next came the deer flies. They’re like gnats in that they don’t like hat brims.
 So from now till late summer, when I spend a lot of time outdoors, I’ll be wearing a hat.
 n n n
 But what kind of hat?
 I won’t say I’ve tried them all, but I have tried plenty.
 First off, I prefer a hat that’s lightweight, not so tight it gives me a headache, not so loose it sits on top of my head. Preferably it has a band that won’t increase my sweating.
 Since most rain gear has a hood nowadays, I tend not to wear a hat in the rain since it can just get in the way.
 Some of the more memorable hats I’ve owned:

At a hastily called news conference to announce the deal, Daines and Gardner were joined by 10 other senators from both parties as eager lawmakers jumped to back a rare bill destined for approval in the slow-moving Senate. That was in early March, days before the pandemic derailed Congress from most legislation not related to the virus.
 It's three months later, and the bill is set for approval as early as Tuesday.
 “America deserves a break right now, and the outdoors is restorative,'' said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., a longtime advocate of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In an interview, Cantwell credited a “new coalition” of lawmakers who support conservation and public lands.
 "We've made people aware of the juggernaut that the outdoors economy has been,'' Cantwell said. She cited statistics showing that outdoor recreation and tourism supports $887 billion a year in consumer spending and 7.6 million jobs, much of it in the West.
 Cantwell credited Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., for forcing attention on the conservation fund by blocking a 2018 spending bill that did not renew the program. It uses federal royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling to pay for conservation and public recreation projects. The program is authorized to collect $900 million a year but generally receives less than half that amount from Congress as lawmakers bicker over how the money should be spent.
 Burr's actions helped “educate" lawmakers on the importance of the fund, Cantwell said. Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee also pushed to renew it, along with nearly all Democrats.
 While widely supported, the outdoors bill faces sharp opposition, mainly from Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and other Gulf Coast senators pushing to ensure it includes revenue-sharing for their states from offshore drilling. A separate group of conservatives opposes new federal land acquisitions.
 Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, complained during debate that the bill was "written behind closed doors and is now being hermetically sealed, walled off from amendments” by Senate leaders. "Forget the theatrics in Seattle — this bill is the real ‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,’ ” Lee said.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — As New Mexico’s oil and gas industry struggles with lower prices and slowing production brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, some members of Congress and state officials are urging the U.S. Interior Department to allow operators to temporarily plugs wells until prices stabilize. U.S. Rep. Xochitl Torres Small’s district includes part of the Permian Basin, one of the most prolific production areas in the U.S. The New Mexico Democrat is among those who have asked for more federal money to plug abandoned wells on state and tribal land. “The consequences have been devastating for local economies across southeastern New Mexico,\" Torres Small said of the downturn in demand. \"Providing oil and gas operators the flexibility to temporarily shut in their wells will help meet needs where current guidance falls short.” She and other supporters say implementing a policy for plugging wells would benefit oil and gas workers, the environment and the economy. She pointed to New Mexico's dependence on the industry for more than one-third of its budget and the jobs that are associated with the oilfield. State labor officials estimate about 4,100 oilfield workers had filed for unemployment as of May 5, as companies cut operations and left the state. While the industry is starting to rebound, Torres Small said there's still a long way to go and that the proposed federal rule making could provide regulatory certainty for operators and reduce the administrative obstacles to ceasing operations of oil and gas wells. “With BLM (Bureau of Land Management) leases, there’s a lot of red tape. It was unclear if they could temporarily shut in a well or stop production,” Torres Small said. “We already have a supply glut. This will give them that...

Many of us have experienced the excitement and awe of watching 8,000-pound orcas, or “killer whales,” soar out of the water and fly through the air at sea parks, as if in perfect harmony with their trainers. Yet this mighty black and white mammal has many sides — a majestic, friendly giant, seemingly eager to take trainers for a ride around the pool, yet shockingly — and unpredictably — able to turn on them at a moment’s notice. _BLACKFISH_ unravels the complexities of this dichotomy, employing the story of notorious performing whale Tilikum, who — unlike any orca in the wild — has taken the lives of several people while in captivity.

For Jim Nantz, it's a position unlike any other.
   
 Welcoming viewers back to pro golf at the Charles Schwab Challenge this week on CBS and Golf Channel, he said, will demand more than a simple "Hello, friends" amid a global pandemic and national unrest.
   
 "People are tuning in to watch a golf tournament, but I don't think we would be handling it properly if we didn't recognize that there is a lot going on in our country right now," Nantz said.
   
 "I'm 61 years old and I consider this to be, perhaps, the most important moment in this country in my lifetime. We just have to get this moment in history right. We can't let this opportunity pass without real and meaningful progress when it comes to equality, diversity, justice, love and empathy, and I hope to express that at the top."
   
 Beyond whatever Nantz says by way of introduction, however, coronavirus precautions make it impossible for him and his colleagues to see things as they once did.
   
 Literally.
   
 Nantz normally shares his perch at golf tournaments above the 18th-hole gallery with five or six people. He'll have only a robotic camera for company in the tower at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas. There'll be no spectators below.
   
 Nick Faldo and fellow analysts Frank Nobilo and Ian Baker-Finch will be monitoring play from a Florida studio more than 1,100 miles away.
   
 "Certainly, this is a production unlike any golf production we've ever done at CBS," CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus said. "First and foremost, the health and safety of all of our personnel on site and in control rooms across the country has been paramount. ... The thing I worry about the most ... is somebody in our crew getting sick."
   
 With that in mind, McManus' team has pushed for cooperation from players and tour officials to break down old barriers to make the coverage more engaging and introduce viewer to golfers in new and more intimate ways.
   
 "This is a wonderful opportunity for the game, for the PGA Tour," Nantz said. "They have a chance to go before a sports-starved nation and have a chance to create a fan base, a wider fan base, than it has ever had before.
   
 Players on the back nine will be invited to pop into a tent with only a camera and a microphone in it to answer a question printed on a card.
   
 The absence of fans may enable some golfers to be heard talking with their caddies on the course, but the TV people are trying to convince some players to wear microphones.
   
 Said Nantz: "Someone conceivably on Sunday could hole a putt from 20 feet on the 18th green. There is no roar. There's not even presumably a handshake with his caddy. It's going to be one of the interesting things that we're going to have to figure out how to play it naturally."
   
 Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
   
 Even without any fans to cheer, there was quite a reaction to a birdie during the PGA Tour's return -- a very audible "F-bomb" at the start of Golf Channel's telecast Thursday.
   
 The network had been on the air for only a few minutes when the first shot from the afternoon round it showed was Jon Rahm chipping in at the par-3 eighth hole at Colonial.
   
 "Pretty (expletive) good there," someone was clearly heard saying from off camera while Rahm was still being shown on the screen.
   
 "Well, we were hoping for better audio with no fans, surrounding the course," commentator Jim Nantz then said on the broadcast. "Apologize if anybody was offended with what they may have heard there."

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Adriana Sokalski was set to graduate in May from the electrical program at Kirkland Community College in Grayling, but when the pandemic halted necessary hands-on classes, her life was put on hold. “It definitely puts me back. I live in a rural area as it is, it’s kind of hard to find a job up here,” Sokalski said. “In order to try to finish my stuff and have the credentials to apply for a job, it’s very hard.” Sokalski is among the Michigan college students whose futures are being delayed. For trade and skills careers, online learning efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19 are difficult and can fall short as hands-on learning paused and graduations are postponed. It all comes at a time when the state has tried several approaches to entice students into trade careers as gaps in the workforce are expected through 2026. Sokalski was doing electrical work with an apprenticeship license downstate, but was laid off, as were many Michigan residents. Filings for unemployment have reached 2.2 million during the pandemic. On top of regular college student stresses, Sokalski said, the log home that her parents built burned down before the pandemic. As a student in rural northern Michigan, connecting to the internet to do her classwork became another hurdle. A study done through the Quello Center at Michigan State University found that only 53% of students in rural areas have high-speed internet access, compared to 77% of students in suburbs. The study found that lack of internet access impacts test scores, likelihood to pursue higher education and even what career a students may choose. “We’ve been bouncing from house to house during all this,” Sokalski said. “Some places don’t have internet or anything like that so I was trying...

(AP) --Faulty software or poorly calibrated vote-tabulation scanners used to count mailed-in ballots in this week's chaotic Georgia primary may have prevented thousands of votes from being counted, election officials and voting integrity activists say.The issue was identified in at least four counties, DeKalb, Morgan, Clarke and Cherokee, according to officials who discovered them, including activists who have sued the state for alleged election mismanagement.“The fact that it is in multiple counties tells me that it’s probably systemic,” Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist who has testified for the plaintiffs, because identical scanners and software were used to count all absentee ballots across the state. DeMillo said the only way to know for sure is through audits.A top Georgia voting official, voting implementation manager Gabriel Sterling, said Friday that he had seen no evidence yet of the issue and found it difficult to believe the reports were “an active description of what is happening on the ground.”“These are activists who have an ax to grind,” he said.Nearly 1.1 million Georgians voted by mail for Tuesday's primary, which had been delayed twice due to the coronavirus pandemic.In-person voting Tuesday was beset by cascading failures. Voters waited up to five hours to cast ballots at some polling places due to equipment problems, poll worker unfamiliarity with a new voting system and social distancing measures taken because of the virus. Many voters also showed up to vote in person because absentee ballots they requested never arrived by mail.The scanners and ballot-marking devices used in all 159 Georgia counties Tuesday are part of a voting equipment package the state purchased for $120 million from Dominion Voting Systems after a federal judge ordered it to scrap an outdated, untrustworthy system.In post-election reviews, bipartisan panels in all four counties detected unregistered votes while examining ballot images flagged by the vote-tallying scanner's software for anomalies.In Morgan County, Republican-dominated and just southeast of Atlanta, panelists discovered at least 20 votes on scanned ballot images that the program had not recorded, said Jeanne Dufort, a Democrat on the panel. She said it appeared the votes did not register because ovals that were supposed to be filled in were instead checked or marked with X's.All three panelists agreed to add the unregistered votes to the electronic tally, said Dufort. But on Thursday, the county elections board voted 3-2 not to audit the rest of the roughly 3,000 absentee ballots. The other two panelists, a Republican appointee and the election director, did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment.“It is a head-in-the-sand approach," Dufort complained.In Clarke County, vote review panelist Adam Shirley estimated at least 30 ballots out of about 300 flagged for anomalies had votes that “the system had not marked at all, that had not processed at all.”Shirley, a Democrat, recommended a review of all 15,000 absentee ballots.In an email Friday to fellow board members, county election board chair Jesse Evans said “it's not just possible but probable that a ballot whose voter had clearly but not completely marked their vote would not have its votes counted by the software.”In an email to Evans, Shirley said he found it disturbing that the software did not flag the uncounted votes. "We only noticed them by sheer luck as we were adjudicating other, flagged contests on ballots.”In Cherokee County, the problem was detected in less than 5% of the flagged ballots, said an elections official who spoke on condition they not be further identified, citing fear of political harassment. The official said the number of flagged ballots was in the hundreds.In DeKalb, County, review panel member Elizabeth Burns estimated finding between 20-50 uncounted votes on 530 flagged ballots and said her team had so far only reviewed half its 100,000 absentee ballots. Like Shirley, she said her team had stumbled upon the issue. She said she wondered how many other counties were aware of it.“Maybe not everyone has been as thorough as us and noticed this,” she said.“The detection of this major problem was only because of diligent citizen oversight. The officials charged with the duty to fully test the equipment recklessly failed to responsibly do so, or to audit it,” said Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, which is demanding in court that the state scrap the ballot- marking devices.Dominion spokeswoman Kay Stimson referred questions to the state, but said in an email that her company's systems “are designed to support robust post-election audits, and we support them as a recommended best practice for elections.”Sterling, the state official, said authorities are willing to consider audits if merited.Voting security expert Harri Hursti said inadequate pre-election testing may be the cause of the issue. A fix could be as simple as adjusting the contrast settings in the image-capturing software. Or it could be a different coding issue.The Dominion election system used on Tuesday is proprietary. Hursti said it has never been subjected to an independent security review.It was, however, denied certification by Texas, which cited “multiple hardware and software issues” identified by state- appointed examiners. They cited a complex installation process and one called the suite “fragile and error prone.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I've never seen much indication that EWTN is part of the problem. Not sure why Fr. Pavone hasn't a parish assignment (and what Fr. Z is doing in Michigan when he's incardinated to an Italian diocese), but it does occur to me that some people are ill adapted to parish work. There was for some years ca. 2003 a priest of the Diocese of Kalamazoo who was all over the place in Catholic publications. He was assigned to administer a parish in Dorr, Michigan and gradually faded away. Nothing's been heard from him in about 10 years. He stayed in Dorr a few years and then was pulled out of parish work, sent for additional graduate work in Rome, put on the chancery staff, etc. He now has an address at some parish cluster in the diocese, but he apparently only works the hospitals while being appended to the chancery part time.

 “This is a legacy thing,'' Gardner told Trump, pointing to a portrait of Theodore Roosevelt that dominates the room.
 ”We wanted to make landmark legislation about our great landmarks,'' Gardner said in an interview.
 The senators showed Trump pictures and maps of their states and stressed the importance of conservation in the West.

The police of Uttar Pradesh on Saturday arrested 16 youths for allegedly attacking a group of Dalit men in Azamgarh district, _The Indian Express_ reported. As many as twelve Dalit men were injured in the attack. Chief Minister Adityanath said the National Security Act will be invoked against the accused.
 Under the National Security Act, a person can be detained for months if the authorities feel that the individual is a threat to national security, law and order. The government can also withhold information which it considers to be against public interest to disclose when providing the grounds for an arrest.
 The incident occured in the Sikandarpur Aima village of the district on Wednesday. A group of men reportedly attacked some Dalit members of the village after they accused the men of harassing girls from their community, Superintendent of Police of Azamgarh, Triveni Singh told the newspaper.
 The accused used to sit at a tube well in the village and pass objectionable remarks at young Dalit girls passing through the area on their way to school, he added. On Wednesday, an altercation took place after some people from the Dalit community objected to this. A few minutes later, a group of men reportedly assembled near the Dalit locality and started attacking people. They allegedly pelted stones at women.
 A 22-year-old man, identified as Sudhir, suffered an injury caused by a sharp- edged weapon. Eleven others were injured after being attacked with sticks and stones. No casualties were reported.
 Singh said Maharajganj Station House Officer Arvind Pandey, under whose jurisdiction the attack took place, has been suspended on charges of negligence. The police have also announced a reward of Rs 25,000 for information leading to the capture of three other accused who are currently absconding.
 Meanwhile, Additional Superintendent of Police Narendra Pratap Singh said the 16 accused, one of whom is a minor, would be produced in a court on Saturday.
 Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati lauded the Adityanath-led government for initiating action against the accused and said it is “better late than never”. “This is good,” she tweeted. “But it would be better, if similar action was initiated in cases pertaining to sisters and daughters in the future as well.

 Most members were in favour of the plans and backed the idea of bringing dolphins into the baths.
 Coun Barrie Crumblehulme said: “I think it is an excellent idea. Many people in Horwich have told me that if it falls through, they will be extremely disappointed."
 But not everybody felt the same and another local representative, Coun Mike Foster, voiced his concerns that the baths would be out-of-action for too long.
 "Horwich waited 50 years for swimming baths and I don’t really think we got it for fishes to swim about in," he said.
 "To deprive children of their swimming is totally out of order. The baths were put up for the use of the people of Horwich, not for dolphins – and that’s the view of many I have heard."

Penzler and others cite Joseph Wambaugh's 1971 novel "The New Centurions" as a turning point in showing a more realistic portrait of police, although no single trend has prevailed. Over the past 50 years, the image of law enforcement has sometimes mirrored debates between liberals and conservatives. Sidney Lumet's 1973 film "Serpico" dramatized the corruption of New York City police and the heroism of the real-life title character's willingness to speak out. Around the same time, Clint Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" movies positioned Eastwood's San Francisco lawman as a needed rule-breaker in a system too permissive of crime. Spike Lee's landmark 1989 release "Do the Right Thing," in which a black man is choked to death by police, was released two weeks after the premiere of "Lethal Weapon 2" and the crowd pleasing defiance of Mel Gibson's Sgt.

Zinedine Zidane wants Real Madrid to treat their remaining 11 games in La Liga like a World Cup as they aim to overhaul Barcelona to win their second league title in eight years.
 Real sit two points behind Barca and return after three months away against Eibar on Sunday, when they will play in their new training ground home at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium.
 La Liga is due to finish on July 19, meaning there will be fixtures every day while clubs will be in action almost every three days for five and a half weeks.
 Asked if felt like the start of a World Cup, Zidane said on Saturday: “I like the comparison, I buy into it. My players know what it’s like to play in the final stages of a World Cup or European Championship.
 “The important thing is the preparation and I think we have prepared very, very well. Our first match starts tomorrow and we will give everything. I have faith what we have done with the players and now we have to show it on the field.”
 La Liga matches are being played behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic, although league president Javier Tebas has said stadiums could be allowed to be 10 to 15% full before the end of the season.
 “I don’t like playing without fans, that’s my opinion,” Zidane said. “But as always, we have to adapt. This is the situation. There is a government with people who do their work and we have to do ours.”
 Real are playing at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium to allow renovation work to continue at the Santiago Bernabeu this summer.
 The capacity is only 6,000 which would mean far fewer fans could attend if the ban is relaxed.
 “My players want to play in front of an audience and right now, there isn’t one,” Zidane said. “But if those in charge say we can, well then we’ll see. I have been a player and I prefer to play with fans. But it is not an excuse, we are going to play well.”
 Eden Hazard has been included in the squad to face Eibar after he was able to use the break to recover from a foot injury and Marco Asensio is also available again after rupturing his cruciate ligaments last year.
 But Zidane said striker Luka Jovic could miss the run-in after injuring his foot at home and Lucas Vazquez is also out.

"Comparing to existing C5 instances, we observe M6g instances to be superior in every aspect --they cost less, have more RAM, exhibit lower median and significantly narrower tail latency, and run cooler with the same proportional workload per host. Converting our entire ingest worker fleet to M6g instances has allowed us to run 30% fewer instances, and each instance costs 10% less."

"I won't be having another run in with Messi, it went pretty badly the last time as he ended up scoring three goals," Moreno told Spanish radio station Onda Cero ahead of the game.
 Barca were leading Mallorca 2-1 when Messi was subjected to a strong tackle from Joan Sastre and earned a foul which Moreno disputed, provoking an angry reaction from the Argentine.
 Messi then scored his second goal and Luis Suarez struck again immediately after, with the Barca skipper rounding off the thrashing in the second half to complete his treble.
 "It was a foul but at the time I didn't think it was and I told the referee and that didn't go down well with Messi. There was an exchange of words and that was that," Moreno said of the discussion on a podcast with Spanish journalist Edu Pino.

A suspensão de operações policiais em comunidades do Rio durante a pandemia pelo ministro Facchin foi justificada pelos riscos aos quais já está exposta a população das favelas. O ministro ressalva que as ações podem acontecer só “em casos absolutamente excepcionais, que devem ser devidamente justificadas por escrito pela autoridade competente e comunicadas ao Ministério Público estadual, órgão responsável pelo controle externo da atividade policial”.
 O objetivo de Facchin na decisão foi não aumentar essa vulnerabilidade num momento em que a prestação de serviços públicos sanitários se faz tão importante, e as iniciativas de ajuda humanitária também.
 A decisão foi tomada em decorrência de uma Arguição de Descumprimento de Preceito Fundamental apresentada pelo PSB, que questionou os conflitos armados no escopo da política de segurança pública do governo do estado.
 Facchin justificou que as pessoas estão passando a maior parte do tempo em suas residências, e que o risco de as operações vitimarem moradores fica aumentado. Ele se referiu ao caso do menino João Pedro Matos Pinto, de 14 anos, morto a tiros dentro de casa em operação conjunta das polícias Federal e Civil no Complexo do Salgueiro, em São Gonçalo. O crime foi no dia 18 de maio.
 Os tiroteios já interromperam também ações de distribuição de cestas básicas em favelas. Nos dia 20 e 21 de maio, operações paralisaram a ajuda na Cidade de Deus, na Zona Oeste da capital, e no Morro da Providência, no Centro. Duas pessoas foram mortas.

 Spurs could still sneak back into the Champions League if Manchester City's two-season ban from the competition is held up, but United are currently sitting in the coveted fifth spot.
 The two teams will meet in north London next Friday as the top-flight resumes behind closed doors, with Sherwood well aware that Tottenham cannot afford any slip-ups as they look to close the four-point gap between themselves and the Red Devils.
 “The form going into the break counts for nothing,” the former Tottenham midfielder and manager told _Talksport_. “It’s a fresh season.
 “They’ve had a mini pre-season there. They’ve got nine games to finish in their objective, which is in the Champions League.
 “[Paul] Pogba is back as well and that will be a massive plus; Pogba, [Bruno] Fernandes and [Scott] McTominay in that midfield is quite formidable in my opinion.
 “If I’m Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and I’m looking at the teams below me, Tottenham are the major threat. I would say, ‘lets go all out to win this football game’. If you do you put Tottenham to bed, I don’t think they catch Manchester United if they do not beat Manchester United in the first game.”
 Sherwood went on to discuss another of his former club's aspirations in the final weeks of the season, as Aston Villa bid to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.
 The 51-year-old, who had a brief spell in charge at Villa Park in 2015, says Dean Smith's side will once again have to rely on Jack Grealish if they are to beat the drop.
 “I think they’ve got as good a chance as any down there. Obviously they were relying on games later on in the run in at home but it’s going to make no difference now," said Sherwood. “Really, if you are looking at the example of the Bundesliga, the home form counts for very little without the fans being there.
