Mind you, the government doesn’t want to hear us. It doesn’t even want us to speak. In fact, as I make clear in my book  _Battlefield America: The War on the American People_, the government has done a diabolically good job of establishing roadblocks to prevent us from exercising our First Amendment right to speech and assembly and protest.

Target announced Saturday night that it has temporarily closed dozens of stores throughout the country, including multiple Peninsula locations, following damage and looting at some of its stores nationwide amid protests in response to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed by Minneapolis police on Monday, May 25.
 Floyd died Monday after being pinned to the ground by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Bystanders captured video of the officer using his knee to pin down Floyd between his neck and head. Floyd repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe.”
 Local Target stores that have temporarily closed include ones in Mountain View, East Palo Alto, Redwood City and San Mateo. It's unclear when they will reopen. Most closures are in California, Minnesota, Texas and New York.
 "We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country," according to a Target press release. "At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores. We anticipate most stores will be closed temporarily. Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal."
 Protests continued nationwide on Saturday, including in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. Thousands gathered in San Francisco, and as of 8:30 p.m. Saturday night, the protest was peaceful, with many protesters dropping to a knee in the streets while police officers stood by and watched.
 In Oakland, where protests of Floyd's killing Friday night left more than 70 downtown businesses vandalized and/or looted, police were beefing up in preparation to respond to protesters Saturday night. By early Saturday night, there had been no reports of violence. San Jose, which also was the scene of a protest Friday night, had not experienced any problems as of early Saturday night.
 Protests have been held in major cities throughout the country in the past week, with several turning violent.

I am at the point of just giving these people and their areas up, over to their lawlessness, their hate Whitey, celebrate me mentality, their Godless, Racist ways, to implode. Succession or War is the only solution to this problem and that was on the way to happening had not the pandemic delayed it. A high of 70%of Americans poled, thought so! It is on the horizon folks! Everything is past the point of reconciliation with Liberals and the Grass Roots Right Conservative Patriots who fill up the rest of the majority of the State. We can not and will not come together.

Just withdraw them and see what happens! You will destroy yourselves quickly!

Madrid, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 31st May, 2020 ) :La Liga resumes on June 11 after a three-month absence due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Real Madrid and Barcelona have been unable to pull away from each other at the top of the table while Atletico Madrid are involved in what looks like a four- way fight for Champions League qualification.
 AFP Sport takes a look at some key issues ahead of the run-in.
 Turbulent title race When Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu on March 1, it seemed they had halted a dip in form and seized control of the title race.
 But a week later, they handed the initiative back as Barca regained first place by beating Real Sociedad and Madrid lost away at Real Betis.
 A three-month break means a fresh start but Barcelona's two-point lead reflects badly on their challengers, given Barca's own problems off the pitch, including the switch to Quique Setien as coach in January.
 Both sides' imperfections mean there will be more slip-ups to come but if this Barca make it five league titles in six years, Madrid will only have themselves to blame.
 Unfamiliar homes Real Madrid have been given permission by La Liga to play their remaining home games at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium at their training ground to allow planned construction work to go ahead at the Santiago Bernabeu this summer.
 With games being held behind closed doors there would have been little advantage to playing at their usual home and the players might even be better off avoiding an empty 81,000-seater stadium that they are used to being almost full.
 Unexpected returns Neither Eden Hazard nor Luis Suarez expected to play much, or perhaps any, part in the run-in after Hazard underwent surgery on a broken foot in March and Suarez had an operation on his right knee in January.
 The break has allowed both players to recover and the question now is whether either can find peak form and fitness in time to make an impact in the remaining 11 games.

Painting on a canvas, on a brooch even, is very different from painting on a cap, which is very different from painting on a jacket! I had not expected that. I was concerned about not coming too close to the skin, for example. The paint can get scratchy / hard. And, in the long run, I don't want the paint touching my skin - or the wearer's skin. Although the paint is non-toxic and complies with the European EN 71-3 Standard and the ASTM D4236, I still don't want skin contact. So, I had to keep in mind that the edges closest to the skin don't get any paint.

 Suarez's return could be particularly helpful for Barcelona but Setien has said the Uruguayan, who has often taken time to regain sharpness, is not yet ready.
 Real Madrid's Hazard, plagued by injuries in recent months, has had a nightmare first year in Spain but has an unexpected chance to turn things around.
 Fight for Atletico
 Atletico Madrid's momentous win over Liverpool in the Champions League offered Diego Simeone some relief after what has been a disappointing season in La Liga.
 His team sit sixth in the table, having long fallen out of the reckoning for the title and facing a fight even to make the top four.
 Ahead of them between fifth and third are Getafe, Real Sociedad and Sevilla, and with only two points between the four, Atletico could still scrape in.
 But the resilient Getafe and free-flowing Real will both be eager to finish off brilliant campaigns while Sevilla appeared to be hitting their stride before games were suspended.
 Atletico cannot afford to be complacent.
 Pressure at the bottom
 At the other end of the table, Espanyol look doomed, sitting in last place, six points adrift of safety. Leganes, who still have to play away at Barcelona before hosting Real Madrid on the final day, are only three points better off.
 One point then separates Mallorca, Celta Vigo and Eibar, whose players have expressed concerns about the safety of football returning too quickly. Real Valladolid in 15th have a four-point cushion over the bottom three but two wins in their last 10 games suggests they could easily be pulled in too.
 The economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic means the stakes are even higher for these clubs, as they battle to avoid the considerable financial blow of relegation. For all of them, the pressure is on.

"When I did get back to my home in Turin, I always respected social distancing with my wife and children." Bergamo, in the northern Lombardy region, was one of the epicentres of the coronavirus pandemic, with many experts believing Atalanta's Champions League game at San Siro on February 19 to be one of the key causes.
 More than 40,000 fans travelled the 60km to Milan, joining in celebrations for a historic 4-1 result, in the club's first elite European campaign.
 "Every time I think about it, it seems absurd to me: the historic peak of sporting happiness coincided with the greatest pain in the city," said Gasperini.
 "It will take years to truly understand what happened, because right here was the centre of evil." Serie A will return to action after a three-month absence on June 20, with Gasperini's side sitting fourth in the table, 15 points behind leaders Juventus.
 "Some consider it amoral to start again," said the former Inter Milan and Genoa coach.
 "I saw people singing on the balconies of Italy while Bergamo loaded their coffins onto trucks. I didn't consider it 'amoral'.
 "I considered it an instinctive reaction, an attempt to cling to life, to react.
 "Atalanta can help Bergamo to start again ...the people of Bergamo are embers under the ashes.
 "None of the players left the city. More than one has lost weight, which can also be a sign of psychological distress.
 "Atalanta can help Bergamo to restart, respecting the pain and mourning. The team has remained connected with Bergamo's suffering and will bring it to the pitch."

Mike Koelker figured it was now or never.
   
 So the longtime basketball coach and baseball guru threw his name in the hat for the Notre Dame High School volleyball head coaching position.
   
 On Friday, Koelker was officially named head varsity volleyball coach at Notre Dame, where he has spent plenty of time coaching at the junior high level, including volleyball.
   
 Koelker, 65, takes over from Nita Carlson, who retired after 16 years at the school with a 232-305 career record.
   
 Notre Dame advanced to a Class 1A regional quarterfinal last season, losing to Holy Trinity to finish with an 18-19 record.
   
 For Koelker, it is one last hurrah, a final time to try his hand coaching at the varsity level.
   
 It was like a match made in heaven.
   
 "This kind of came out of left field," said Koelker, who led teams to six state boys basketball tournaments. "I'm excited about it. I wasn't sure I would ever be a varsity coach again. I'm really going to work hard at it."
   
 Koelker made his mark coaching boys basketball. The former Dyersville Beckman standout athlete coached Marquette to a state runner-up finish in 1987, then took Winfield-Mount Union to five state tournaments, winning the Class 1A state championship in 1995 and taking runner-up finishes in 1992 and 1996.
   
 But Koelker is not unfamiliar with volleyball. He started the volleyball program at Marquette in West Point in 1980 and coached that team through 1987. Marquette merged with Fort Madison Aquinas and Keokuk Cardinal Stritch in 2005 to form Holy Trinity, which is one of the premier Class 1A programs in the state.
   
 Ironically, Holy Trinity is coached by Melissa Freesmeier, who played on one of Koelker's first teams at Marquette.
   
 Holy Trinity and Notre Dame are set to meet on Sept. 15 at Notre Dame's Father Minnet Gymnasium.
   
 "Melissa was a decent player, but she was a sponge. She always wanted to learn," Koelker said. "We had a girl, Stephanie McCannon, who was probably the second-best player ever to come out of southeast Iowa behind Mikaela Foecke. We got to the regional final the last two years back when it was only two classes. We lost to Mount Vernon both times and they went on to win the state championship."
   
 Koelker, who coached the Notre Dame Junior High volleyball team last year, has been busy studying up on the game in the last couple weeks.
   
 "I have been watching videos and clinics and reading books. I watched a lot of Youtube videos last week," Koelker said. "I learned a lot from Barb Baker and Tom Keating through the years, too."
   
 Koelker is putting together a top-notch staff at Notre Dame. Julie Belger will stay on board as the paid assistant coach, while Megan Stephens, who played at Notre Dame under current New London coach Maureen Heath, is on board as a volunteer assistant coach. Koelker is hoping to add former New London all- state player and former SCC head volleyball coach Susan Reid to his staff as a volunteer, as well.
   
 "If I can get both of them, I will be doing really good," Koelker said. "If I surround myself with good people, that makes me look smarter."
   
 Koelker said he also plans to get some advice from Hall of Fame wrestling coaches Bill Plein and John Siegel. Plein is the athletics director at Notre Dame.
   
 "I wasn't sure I was going to go for this, but then Bill told me, 'Go for it,'" Koelker said. "Bill will be great to work for. I really enjoy working with him. I can pick his brain a little bit. And I've known John since I coached up at Winfield."
   
 Koelker has a solid nucleus of players to build around, including outside hitter Katy Stephens and middle hitter Gabby Deery. Koelker said the first thing he will work on is developing a setter.
   
 Koelker is looking forward to the challenge.
   
 "I've always loved being around athletes, trying to get the best out of kids," said Koelker, who works at the Alternative School in Burlington. "Everyone knows I love basketball and baseball, but I have always loved girls volleyball. I like the pace of it. I really enjoy it.
   
 "I'm nervous, but this is a great challenge and a great opportunity. I'm really looking forward to it."

Jay pleads with Adam to help him stay just a little longer: “Am I that big of a threat to you that you have to strip me of everything?” Adam laughs and says yes. “That’s the only way I can beat you.” Jay replies, “I hate you,” as they both chuckle. The conversation turns deeper, as Jay continues to plead his case. “I know it means a lot to you,” Adam tells his rival. “It means a lot to me too.” Adam finally reveals, for the first time, why he’s playing. He tells Jay that he is doing it to give his mom something to look forward to, watching her son play a game that they both love. They both let their guard down for a brief moment to commiserate, perhaps in a way only rivals can, and fight back tears as they share their fears over their mothers’ health conditions. Jay’s mom suffers from brain aneurisms. Jay tells the camera later, “Me and Adam are both out here for our families, for our moms. He’s not a weasel in my book anymore, he’s a good freakin’ dude; he’s a warrior.” Adam ultimately eliminated Jay, but the mutual respect, and shared love of the game, went much deeper than surface level. When the game ended, Adam rushed back to his mom, who died an hour after he made it home from the show.

Leonard Judson McCollum Leonard Judson McCollum passed peacefully away at his residence with his wife, Sharon, by his side on Wednesday, May 20, 2020. Judson McCollum lived a full life, and if you knew him, he was always laughing and always a joyful person to be around. When he was leaving this world, he left saying his life was always so much fun. Judson was born on September 5, 1943 at Deming AAF New Mexico to the delight of his young parents, Air Force Sargent Leonard James McCollum and his wife, Edith DeVilbiss McCollum. Judson made many friends along the way, and once you became friends with Judson, you were a friend for life. He valued his friendships so very much. He grew up in San Angelo, TX, attending Glenmore Elementary, Robert E. Lee Middle School, and Central High, and he completed his educational journey with a BBA from Angelo State University. He served as president of the Key Club and treasurer of the Student Council at Angelo State. After Judson completed college in 1968, Judson volunteered for the draft to serve his country by joining the U.S. Navy. He was stationed in Argentina, Newfoundland, Canada, and in Norfolk, VA, USA. He served his country until 1973, and always believed that it was a great life-training in discipline and the value of service. He worked for Levi Strauss in Albuquerque as area personnel director until his retirement in 1985, and he absolutely adored his career at Levi's earning corporate awards for excellent work. After retiring from Levi's, Judson became a successful real estate broker in Albuquerque and earned annual awards for his success. He poured his heart and soul into his work. He valued working with customers so very much and befriended many. Real Estate was more than a business to him, it was a passion. He was a trusted friend for life to his customers. Judson was a people person, and once you met him you gained a wonderful friend. Judson always talked about how much fun his life had been. He loved to share stories of life experiences and adventures. He liked everyone he met and everyone he met was his friend. He started every day with a positive note, and he made every day as much fun as possible. He loved his family and friends and he loved his work, which he saw as serving others. Judson had many life interests. He was a sports fan and an avid reader. His interests were in history and fiction, politics, sports, he collected and shared jokes, movies, he loved music, especially 50's and country western music, and he loved cars of any kind. He loved New Mexican food, and he never met a sweet that he did not like, especially cookies, cakes, and candy. He also enjoyed the simple things in life, such as a drive with family and friends to McDonald's for a diet coke, or a coffee visit with a friend. He really loved life and all the simple pleasures. Judson had a talent for planting that started at age four. He never stopped planting and collecting plants, including odd and unusual plants. He was an animal lover and had a large menagerie of pets in his childhood and always had pets throughout his life â€" the most memorable pet was his pet boxer, PoTeet, who accompanied him on his paper route in his childhood years. He was never without one or two favored pets in his lifetime. Judson always had a positive attitude and rose above challenges. He survived being hospitalized with polio when he was young, he dealt with the loss of his father when he was a teenager, and he lived by a famous quote by Winston Churchill he shared to many to inspire them if they were having a difficult time, "Never, Never, Never Give Up." In fact, it was engraved in his vehicle. He was always looking on the bright side of things and helping anyone that he felt needed a friend. His respect and desire to help others was incredible. It was something to be admired. Judson took pride in being a good husband, a son, dedicated brother, a fun uncle, and a trusted friend. He was an honest and hard-working man, and his motto in life was to always do the right thing. He lived his life following the golden rule. He was spiritual and prayed for others, he valued his family and friends more than anything in life, and never missed an opportunity to show them just how much he valued them. Judson left this earth at peace, knowing he lived a good, fun, honest life. He leaves behind mourning the loss of such a wonderful soul, his wife, Sharon; and his family, especially his brothers, Donald McCollum (Vickie McCollum), Bryan McCollum, and sister, Trudy Cole. Judson had many nephews, nieces, grandnephews and grandnieces â€" all of whom he adored beyond measure. Each one being his favorite he would say, and they loved their uncle just as much. He left behind a few good close friends that he kept for life. Judson, you lived life to the fullest and you showed everyone around you what life was truly about â€" the simple things and being kind. May you rest peacefully. Please visit our online guestbook for Judson at www.FrenchFunerals.com

 We haven't solved the storage problem yet, but we could evade it by connecting the whole planet into a single electrical grid.
 This would allow the world to run everything, with the possible exception of air travel, entirely on solar energy. We would need to distribute photovoltaic (PV) panels around the world so that the half of them receiving sunlight at any one time could power the whole world. This would require twice as many PV panels as we'd need if the storage problem were solved.
 Evading the need for storage would double the costs of the PV panels. And moving the extra power -- generated where it is daytime -- to the hemisphere where it is nighttime would also be expensive.
 Which system would be cheaper: storing solar-generated electricity for nighttime and bad weather, or building and operating a worldwide system that doesn't need storage? Your guess is as bad as mine. Expert cost-benefit analysis of these alternatives is a task way beyond any one individual.
 If we build a worldwide system, the Bering Strait -- separating Alaska from Siberia -- is obviously where we would move electricity between the western and eastern hemispheres. The Strait is only 51 miles across and its water averages 160 feet deep.
 In 1864, a Russian-American company planned to put a telegraph cable across the Strait but abandoned the project after a cable was completed across the Atlantic. More recently, bridge and/or tunnel projects across the Bering Strait to allow railroad traffic between Eurasia and America have been seriously considered.
 Once a cable has been built across the Bering Strait, connections to the rest of the world would be straightforward. Through Russia, the system could connect to Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Australia. From Alaska, the system would connect to Canada, the continental United States, and Central and South America.
 A worldwide power grid for solar energy would both reduce threats to our climate and have important political benefits.
 The Bering Strait connection would make Russian-American cooperation strongly in both countries' interests. Neither could afford to pull the plug and plunge the other half of the world into darkness. The plug-pulling country would itself lose access to the electricity it needs twelve hours later. Interest in keeping the connection working would be mutual.
 Electrification of the whole planet would reduce the strategic significance of the Middle East by making oil a less critical part of the world economy. It would allow people everywhere in the world to enjoy an American-European standard of living without allowing energy production to wreck the planet for all of us.
 I began proposing a worldwide solar power grid in 1972, but even by the mid-1980s the idea evoked no interest. Today, the situation has changed thanks to improved solar cells and the danger of carbon fuels. In 2015, Clark Gellings, a prestigious life fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, made a serious proposal for a worldwide grid.
 Such an electrical system could be a great idea if its costs penciled out. The time clearly has come for wider public discussion and intensive study by a commission -- engineers, accountants and many other experts -- of the idea. But this study will be expensive.
 This could be an opportunity for a foundation or a public-spirited billionaire like Bill Gates or George Soros. But Mike Bloomberg, whose degree from Johns Hopkins was in electrical engineering and who has done well financially, could be the ideal person to organize and finance an effort to answer this question.
 Are you interested, Mr. Bloomberg?

Would Thomas Jefferson wear a mask? On the face of it, this is a ludicrous question, since Jefferson is busy being dead, time machines are not yet available, and dragging Jefferson’s legacy into our current encounter with the coronavirus in Donald Trump’s America feels both irrelevant and irreverent. Then again, who better to query, when masks become an issue of liberty, than the man who defined our inalienable rights?
 President Trump has made not wearing a mask a political statement. We assume Trump does not like the way he looks with a mask, so he is asserting his vanity. More significantly, he has urged his most ardent supporters to toss away their masks and join him as a warrior prepared to take risks on the coronavirus battlefield. Those who don’t are either cowards or have been duped by the fake-news media into believing that the pandemic, much like climate change, is a serious, ongoing threat, when in fact it is a hoax that will be exposed as such during the coming summer months, when it will melt away.
 We shall see. Unlike climate change, which is a long-range existential threat, the pandemic is raging now. Its impact in terms of cases and casualties requires no crystal ball. Trump has made a bet that will be proven right or wrong before the November elections. If the former, all the scientific experts will be exposed as weak-kneed charlatans, and Trump will be able to chastise them in his second inaugural in January. If the latter, his handling of the COVID-19 crisis will be exposed as an epic failure, perhaps the greatest lapse of presidential leadership in United States history. Again, we shall see. If you don’t wear a mask over the ensuing months, you endorse the first option. If you do, the latter.
 The Trump version of masks is burdened with one basic misconception. A mask provides only minimal protection for the person wearing one. It provides maximum protection for everyone else in your vicinity. In that sense, not wearing a mask is not a statement of personal courage, but rather a statement of personal indifference to the health and fate of everyone else. The pandemic creates a distinctive political context that forces all citizens to make a public declaration on the classic question of individual rights versus social responsibilities. Whether you do or do not wear a mask is your answer to that question.

Leonard Judson McCollum            Leonard Judson McCollum passed peacefully away at his residence with his wife, Sharon, by his side on Wednesday, May 20, 2020. Judson McCollum lived a full life, and if you knew him, he was always laughing and always a joyful person to be around. When he was leaving this world, he left saying his life was always so much fun. Judson was born on September 5, 1943 at Deming AAF New Mexico to the delight of his young parents, Air Force Sargent Leonard James McCollum and his wife, Edith DeVilbiss McCollum. Judson made many friends along the way, and once you became friends with Judson, you were a friend for life. He valued his friendships so very much. He grew up in San Angelo, TX, attending Glenmore Elementary, Robert E. Lee Middle School, and Central High, and he completed his educational journey with a BBA from Angelo State University. He served as president of the Key Club and treasurer of the Student Council at Angelo State. After Judson completed college in 1968, Judson volunteered for the draft to serve his country by joining the U.S. Navy. He was stationed in Argentina, Newfoundland, Canada, and in Norfolk, VA, USA. He served his country until 1973, and always believed that it was a great life-training in discipline and the value of service. He worked for Levi Strauss in Albuquerque as area personnel director until his retirement in 1985, and he absolutely adored his career at Levi's earning corporate awards for excellent work. After retiring from Levi's, Judson became a successful real estate broker in Albuquerque and earned annual awards for his success. He poured his heart and soul into his work. He valued working with customers so very much and befriended many. Real Estate was more than a business to him, it was a passion. He was a trusted friend for life to his customers. Judson was a people person, and once you met him you gained a wonderful friend. Judson always talked about how much fun his life had been. He loved to share stories of life experiences and adventures. He liked everyone he met and everyone he met was his friend. He started every day with a positive note, and he made every day as much fun as possible. He loved his family and friends and he loved his work, which he saw as serving others. Judson had many life interests. He was a sports fan and an avid reader. His interests were in history and fiction, politics, sports, he collected and shared jokes, movies, he loved music, especially 50's and country western music, and he loved cars of any kind. He loved New Mexican food, and he never met a sweet that he did not like, especially cookies, cakes, and candy. He also enjoyed the simple things in life, such as a drive with family and friends to McDonald's for a diet coke, or a coffee visit with a friend. He really loved life and all the simple pleasures. Judson had a talent for planting that started at age four. He never stopped planting and collecting plants, including odd and unusual plants. He was an animal lover and had a large menagerie of pets in his childhood and always had pets throughout his life â€" the most memorable pet was his pet boxer, PoTeet, who accompanied him on his paper route in his childhood years. He was never without one or two favored pets in his lifetime. Judson always had a positive attitude and rose above challenges. He survived being hospitalized with polio when he was young, he dealt with the loss of his father when he was a teenager, and he lived by a famous quote by Winston Churchill he shared to many to inspire them if they were having a difficult time, "Never, Never, Never Give Up." In fact, it was engraved in his vehicle. He was always looking on the bright side of things and helping anyone that he felt needed a friend. His respect and desire to help others was incredible. It was something to be admired. Judson took pride in being a good husband, a son, dedicated brother, a fun uncle, and a trusted friend. He was an honest and hard-working man, and his motto in life was to always do the right thing. He lived his life following the golden rule. He was spiritual and prayed for others, he valued his family and friends more than anything in life, and never missed an opportunity to show them just how much he valued them. Judson left this earth at peace, knowing he lived a good, fun, honest life. He leaves behind mourning the loss of such a wonderful soul, his wife, Sharon; and his family, especially his brothers, Donald McCollum (Vickie McCollum), Bryan McCollum, and sister, Trudy Cole. Judson had many nephews, nieces, grandnephews and grandnieces â€" all of whom he adored beyond measure. Each one being his favorite he would say, and they loved their uncle just as much. He left behind a few good close friends that he kept for life. Judson, you lived life to the fullest and you showed everyone around you what life was truly about â€" the simple things and being kind. May you rest peacefully. Please visit our online guestbook for Judson at      www.FrenchFunerals.com

Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer has a new interior design concept for its Praetor 600 private jet, one that seamlessly blends two seemingly opposite themes.


  Called the Praeterra, a portmanteau between Praetor and terra - Portuguese for Earth, the concept seeks to incorporate the idea of a digital future with sustainability. The high-tech design on the interior is complemented by environmentally friendly measures that include using materials that are sourced sustainably, recycled, and can have a purpose once they're no longer required inside the airplane.


  The Praeterra concept was designed around the cabin of Embraer's newest super-midsize aircraft, the Praetor 600. Embraer announced the aircraft's production in 2018 as the next step up from the Praetor 500, a smaller midsize aircraft.

Saturday morning, Mayor Levar Stoney addressed Friday night’s protest — which RPD said had no arrests — and the violent injustices that continue to happen against black communities. Stoney told VPM that while he understands the outrage, those who are damaging black-owned businesses should stay home.
 “What you’re seeing around this country and saw in Richmond last night is built up pain. I feel that, and it hurts,” Stoney later tweeted. “I know it could have been me or my brother. But two wrongs don’t make a right. If you love this city, you’ll express your pain without hurting others.”
 Richmond police said an officer suffered a minor injury during the protest Friday, but that they’re not aware of anyone being arrested.
 Police also said they are currently assessing the damage from the protests and contacting property owners.
 One black-owned business impacted Friday night was Waller & Company Jewelers, which has been in business off Broad Street for 120 years and had a window smashed in by a brick, according to surveillance cameras.
 Another was Success Beaute Bar on West Grace Street, which hasn’t yet celebrated a year, didn’t qualify for federal paycheck protection loans and is waiting for the insurance company to open on Monday to assess the damage.
 Owner Kurtshel Stroman said the windows were broken, four televisions were ripped off the wall and the front door taken down. This weekend would’ve been the first she could open following the pandemic, but now she’s not sure when that will be.
 “What statement are you making by breaking the windows of a black business, stealing from a black business? You can’t make that statement that you’re trying to make,” she said. “We have people that are not even involved directly in the community that is affected who are coming in to do these loots and riots thinking that they are helping and they are hurting.”
 Stroman said she believes her salon was damaged because of its proximity to the police precinct. She said she supports peaceful protest and wishes these same efforts would go into advocating for policy change.
 A GRTC Pulse bus was set on fire Friday night during the protest, but no employees or passengers were injured, according to a GRTC statement Saturday. GRTC also announced that it will suspend service from 8 p.m. Saturday to Sunday night.
 “The safety of our staff and passengers is the most important factor in determining service levels. We can replace property, but we can’t replace people,” said GRTC CEO Julie Timm. “I also believe it is important for GRTC to make space for people to protest this weekend without endangering our GRTC family members. We are closely monitoring this evolving situation in Richmond and will only provide service when we determine it is safe.”
 GRTC plans to resume service Monday morning but may have service delays or end service following protests.
 Capitol Square was closed to the public Saturday after Friday night’s protest.
 “The decision to keep Capitol Square closed was made after multiple surrounding buildings were damaged during civil unrest Friday,” according to a statement from the Department of General Services and Capitol Police.
 Damage mentioned included a window broken in the Barbara Johns Building and the vandalizing of the Virginia Capitol Visitor’s Center, the Virginia Supreme Court Building and the Washington Building.
 Capitol Square is usually closed from 11 p.m. until 6 a.m. A reopening date or time has not been disclosed.
 Friday night’s protest began around 8:30 p.m. and was in response to the ongoing police violence that has impacted black communities, including the death of Floyd, a black man who was killed after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
 Protesters in Richmond also paid tribute to Marcus-David Peters, a VCU alum who was killed by Richmond police officers in 2018 during a mental health crisis.
 The Hanover NAACP announced a Call to Action Event on Sunday at 1 p.m. about the death of Floyd and other acts of violence at the hands of law enforcement. It will be held downtown at the Richmond Reconciliation Statue at 15th and East Main streets but is closed to the public.
 Speakers include Stoney and the president of the Richmond Branch NAACP, the superintendent of Richmond Public Schools and the Richmond police chief, among others. The meeting will be streamed on Facebook Live.
 An online flyer circulating Saturday called for a peaceful protest at 6 p.m. Monday starting at the Capitol.
 Longtime organizer Iman Shabazz said these issues go beyond businesses being attacked or wanting police accountability. They’re rooted in systemic oppression, he said.
 “If we’re not talking about providing resources, if you’re not talking about the type of genuine and authentic inclusion, then I don’t expect anything to happen,” Shabazz said. Without it, he said, communities are waiting for the next “unfortunate, egregious” act to occur.
 Some local organizers, such as Chelsea Higgs Wise, said the goal is to get the reform in policing they have worked toward for years, not just news conferences or statements.
 In a Friday webinar made up of black activists, mental health advocates and social workers, they called for a civilian review board to hold police accountable in Richmond and establish the “Marcus Alert” in honor of Peters — the teacher who was fatally shot during a mental health crisis. The shooting was deemed justified by prosecutors.
 Activists also asked for more transparency in how Richmond police conduct crisis intervention training and their de-escalation practices.
 “The way to do that isn’t by meeting at the reconciliation statue,” Higgs Wise said. “It’s by actually reconciling with these organizers you’ve been pushing off for years and sitting down and talking about what has to be done right now.”

The virus is still out there, and any contact with people outside your household poses at least some risk.
 “I think one of the really important messages we need to continue to stress is: We are not out of the woods,” said Dr. Mark Rupp, the chief of the infectious diseases division at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “If we’re not smart and we’re not careful, we run the risk of having the virus really come back with a vengeance and create a lot of havoc and unnecessary pain and suffering.”
 People need to shift their mindsets, said Rupp and Dr. Bob Rauner, the Lincoln-based chief medical officer of a network of Nebraska clinics who’s been releasing weekly coronavirus updates on YouTube.
 Even with some restrictions easing up, without a vaccine or effective treatments for the coronavirus, there’s no turning back the clock to the way we lived pre-pandemic, before “COVID-19” and “social distancing” became part of the national vocabulary.
 “That’s … not a realistic possibility right now,” Rupp said. “If people do relax all their precautions and start to mix freely … without consideration, we will have increased cases and we will have more people die than is necessary.”

LANSING -- Gov. Gretchen Whitmer hinted Friday that she will soon reopen more regions of Michigan, expressing optimism as long as the rate of new coronavirus cases continues downward and testing increases.
   
 She did not specify when she may act, alluding to an announcement on additional areas in "coming days." Her administration will discuss the issue internally Saturday.
   
 The governor's stay-at-home order -- which first took effect more than nine weeks ago and has been gradually loosened -- remains in place at least two more weeks, as does a measure keeping closed theaters, gyms, hair salons and other places of public accommodation.
   
 Six of eight regions are in phase three, "flattening." Two in less populated northern Michigan are in phase four, "improving," where restaurants can serve dine-in customers if capacity is cut in half, people can go to retail shops without an appointment and office work is allowed if it cannot be done remotely. As of Wednesday, those two regions had seen an average of just 1.3 to 2.8 new cases a day per million people in the previous week.
   
 "If it continues this way, I'm optimistic that in the coming days we'll be in a position to take another step forward," Whitmer said. Asked specifically about private campgrounds as the weather warms -- state park and forest campgrounds are closed -- she said opening private campgrounds is not safe "although I suspect in the coming days that that may change."
   
 The state reported 34 additional COVID-19 deaths and 607 more cases. The totals are 5,406 deaths and about 56,600 cases.
   
 Of the six downstate regions that have not yet advanced to the next phase, average daily case rates per million ranged between 9.9 and 15.2 in the Jackson, Saginaw, Lansing, Kalamazoo and Detroit areas. Just one, the Grand Rapids region, stood higher, at 32.6 per million.
   
 County leaders in part of that region this week urged the Democratic governor to end her stay-home order on June 12, however, saying a recent extension was "deflating" and "demoralizing" after much planning.
   
 Ottawa County is a growing county along Lake Michigan and a magnet for summer tourists. Commissioners -- including the lone Democrat on the Republican- dominated board -- unanimously voted to send a letter to the governor, a rare step so far among the state's local governments.
   
 "There is a growing loss of credibility and belief in the 'Stay Home and Stay Safe' executive order," board chairman Roger Bergman said in the letter, noting that some businesses can reopen while others are closed despite a pledge from owners to make them safe for employees and customers.
   
 "Candidly, most people here in West Michigan figured that end date was May 28th, and the extension was a deflating and, frankly, demoralizing impairment of careful planning," Bergman said.
   
 Whitmer announced she will testify in Congress next week about the state's response to the virus. She said her aggressive actions are working.
   
 "Orders don't fix the problem. It's the response to them that do," she said. "Every Michigander should be proud of what we've accomplished. Let's not drop our guard now."
   
 Late Friday, the Justice Department weighed in on the side of seven businesses challenging the constitutionality of the governor's orders in federal court. They include a real estate brokerage, lawn and property maintenance company, automotive glass exporter, engine oil and auto parts distributor, jewelry store, dental office and group of car washes.
   
 Many, if not all, of the businesses have been allowed to open since filing the lawsuit a month ago but incurred revenue losses and still may face some restrictions.
   
 "As important as it is that we stay safe during these challenging times, it is also important to remember that we do not abandon our freedoms and our dedication to the rule of law in times of emergency," Matthew Schneider, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in a statement.
   
 Whitmer said she has "absolute confidence in the legal authority I have exercised to protect the people of Michigan. It is crystal clear that this challenge is coming directly from the White House, which is ignoring the risk of a second wave of the virus and pushing too quickly to roll back public health guidelines."

Still, years in, their financial instability was so ingrained that when a producer called saying they'd spied Joanna's self-taught work on DesignMom.com and were curious if she and her husband would ever consider doing TV, they were hesitant.


  "That's a scam," Chip insisted. "Don't call them back."


  Fortunately they did and in 2012, producers at High Noon Entertainment flew out to Waco to capture the moment Chip showed Jo the houseboat he had purchased sight unseen, and then continued rolling as she moved past her dismay to help her eternally hopeful husband transform the trash into true treasure. Sensing they'd captured lightening in a mason jar, they returned to film a pilot later that year as the pair set about overhauling their 100-year- old farmhouse.


  "That evolving business model was just the thing that pushed the concept of a Chip-and-Joanna TV show over the top," Joanna recalled in  _The Magnolia Story_. "The folks at HGTV loved the idea of following home buyers through the process from start to finish, from selection through renovation, with a big reveal at the end when they finally saw the finished product."

A year ago, lawmakers approved Gov. Jared Polis’ top priority — funding for full-day kindergarten. But analysts used dubious assumptions to shave $40 million off the estimated cost. However, when school started last fall, the sleight of hand was exposed, and legislators had to pay the full cost.
 In September, the Colorado Sun reported that legislation passed by the Democrat-controlled House and Senate “often masked the true cost” by keeping spending low in the first year and pushing costs to future years.
 In December, even with a projected $825 million more to spend, legislators said they wouldn’t be able to fund routine maintenance of state buildings. “We’re allowing state buildings to crumble,” said then-Rep. Chris Hansen, a Denver Democrat, calling this “a massive liability that will catch up with us.”
 This year, lawmakers were contemplating even more spending on mandatory paid leave and public health insurance programs.
 To make matters worse, the Legislature has never established a “rainy day fund” to help offset budget cuts in hard times, making Colorado the only state without a permanent budget savings account. Over the past nine years, the state put away just $871 million — less than 1% of the general fund spending and a pittance compared to the current $3.3 billion shortfall.
 In February, state Treasurer Dave Young, a Democrat and former member of the Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee, urged budget writers to establish a permanent reserve. That admonition fell on deaf ears as had others in the past because politicians would rather boast about creating programs rather than about preparing for hard times.
 Now the spending lobby is telling legislators, “This is not the time to cut funding for (insert budget item here).” They argue that state spending is counter-cyclical to the economy, meaning that the need for social safety net programs is greatest during an economic slowdown when tax revenues also decline.
 That argument has merit, but neither lobbyists nor legislators show any inclination to take their foot off the fiscal accelerator in good times to ease the pain when hardship strikes. Instead, legislators have actually reduced the general fund reserve over the past two years.
 Predictably, some legislators and the “spending lobby” and the state Capitol complain that the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights makes it “impossible” to establish a rainy day fund.
 That’s hogwash.
 A meaningful budget savings account must be established in the constitution to prevent legislators from raiding it on a whim. Such a measure easily could be referred by the Legislature for a public vote.

Though one case is high profile and the other obscure, the two events have a few similarities.
 Floyd stood 6 feet, 6 inches tall. Burnett was 6 feet, 7 inches tall. Floyd worked as a truck driver and security guard in Chicago; Burnett worked at a bike shop in Colorado Springs. Four officers tried to arrest Floyd; five tried to arrest Burnett. Each man died in the custody of arresting officers. Based on available information, neither man was shot.
 The four officers who tried to arrest Floyd were instantly fired. The five who tried to arrest Burnett were instantly placed on leave. Both arrests are under investigation by outside agencies.
 The similarities end there. Floyd was lived on wages; Burnett was the recipient of a substantial inheritance. Burnett lived in a gated community near the world-class Broadmoor resort. Floyd was suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill; police suspected Burnett of wielding a knife in a confrontation with neighbors.
 The more substantial difference, as of this writing, involves public accountability. Most people in the United States have witnessed and analyzed Floyd’s gruesome death repeatedly as it plays on TV, YouTube and social media. It is a source of sleepless nights and nightmares. President Donald Trump saw the footage while flying on Air Force One and immediately called for a federal investigation.
 Floyd’s survivors, the Minneapolis community and the entire country are fortunate for cellphone footage taken by a witness and turned over to the media. If more footage emerges, it will only further the cause of justice.

Kenya had already lost Sh56.7 billion and had about 137,965 jobs affected as of April 2, the association said.
 “To minimise the impact on jobs and the broader African economy it is vital that governments step up their efforts to aid the industry,” IATA said.
 The new alert comes after KQ announced it will seek a government bailout after grounding its aircraft due to the ban on international flights, signalling a cut in revenue. KQ chief executive officer Allan Kilavuka said the airline is still waiting for government action.
 “We are still talking with the government. In terms of time frame, it’s the Ministry of Transport and National Treasury to decide,” he said in a phone interview.
 IATA is also appealing to development banks and other sources of finance to support Africa’s air transport sectors.
 “Airlines in Africa are struggling for survival. Air Mauritius has entered voluntary administration, South African Airways and SA Express are in business rescue, other distressed carriers have placed staff on unpaid leave or signalled their intention to cut jobs,” it said. “More airlines will follow if urgent financial relief is not provided.”
 KQ has announced that top executives and employees will take a pay cut of up to 75 per cent of their gross salaries as part of mitigation measures to save the firm. The airline is also facing increased competition from Ethiopian Airlines in the cargo business, the only revenue driver for now.
 This is after the government exempted exports of flowers, fresh fruits, vegetables and medical supplies from the flight ban.
 The government signed a deal allowing Ethiopian Airlines to use passenger planes for shipment of cargo from JKIA.
 The economic damage of a crippled aviation industry, IATA said, extends far beyond the sector itself.
 “Aviation in Africa supports 6.2 million jobs and $56 billion (Sh5.88 trillion) in GDP. Sector failure is not an option, more governments need to step up,” said Muhammad Al Bakri, IATA’s regional vice-president for Africa and the Middle East.

CASPER, Wyo. (AP) — Craig Bohl is spending more time than most coaches these days dabbling in technology. Not only does Wyoming’s coach have his own assistants and players to keep tabs on, but he’s also a member of the NCAA’s Division I Football Competition Committee and serves on the American Football Coaches Association Board of Trustees. With the upcoming college football season in limbo amid the coronavirus pandemic, that means frequent Zoom meetings with commissioners, athletic directors and coaches nationwide are part of Bohl’s weekly routine. That doesn’t count all the times he has picked up the phone to call some of his coaching peers around the Mountain West, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. “A lot of communication,” Bold told the Star-Tribune in a phone interview. “We’re throwing out a lot of different ideas, and there’s a lot of probing. A lot of people asking what everybody else is doing. Everybody wants to bring back football in a safe manner, and there’s just different perspectives from different parts of the country. A lot of really good dialogue. Not a ton of hard and fast decisions, though.” Bohl said he normally hops on a conference call with the MW once a week, which is usually spearheaded by the league’s commissioner, Craig Thompson. The same goes for calls with the competition committee, which also includes Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin and Stanford coach David Shaw. The AFCA board holds a conference call every other week, Bohl said. Regardless of which call he’s on, much of the conversation remains focused on contingency plans for the season, though a recent ruling by the NCAA has inspired more confidence that teams will be able to get in a full 12-game schedule this fall. College sports’ governing body voted to lift the moratorium on voluntary...

It should come as no surprise that Joel McHale is funny AF. He masterfully wrings sarcasm out of conversation like he's squeezing every last drop of juice from an orange. McHale's humor and snark were on full display as my first guest on CNET's new interview podcast, I'm So Obsessed.


  Like many people, I first became a fan of McHale when he played student Jeff Winger on Dan Harmon's offbeat comedy Community, which ended its six-season run in 2015. When our conversation turned toward Community, you can hear how much the show, its cast and creator, Harmon, mean to him even now.


  "I don't watch a lot of it because the memories are almost so wonderfully painful and I look back on it with such fondness," McHale says. "I knew that Dan had this vision. The bones and world he was creating was in that first script. I was just like, 'This guy clearly knows what he's doing. He's way smarter than me and he's way funnier than me and I will follow that guy.'"


  McHale is a triple threat as an actor, comic and show host. During the coronavirus pandemic, he joined forces with fellow Community alum Ken Jeong to record The Darkest Timeline podcast. The May 18 episode featured most of the Community's cast, including Donald Glover, and was recorded just after the group did a reading of a Community episode to raise money for World Central Kitchen and Frontline Foods, charities that supply meals to first responders and vulnerable communities during the pandemic.


  Then there was that viral Twitter and Instagram video of a shirtless McHale wearing Ikea animal print mats on his shoulders and a fake tattoo of the word Netflix below his beltline. He was promoting an aftershow episode he hosted for the Netflix documentary series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, which dominated pop culture and social media in the early days of sheltering in place.

Marzano added that equally as valuable has been the emphasis to keep the residents healthy, especially with them being confined to their rooms and some with risks for falling. "It's so important to keep the residents from going to the hospitals as well," she said, adding there's concerns with sitting in one space for 24 hours without moving around.
 To address that, personnel have been going to the rooms to do activities - and activities that used to occur in the activity room are now done in the hallway.
 "There's several tings you can do," Smith explained. "You just need to be creative, and organized about it."
 For example, Marzano said they had a little Cinco de Mayo celebration. "We had a traveling little cart with margaritas on it and churros," she said. "They were dancing in their room with all the staff. The residents really enjoyed it."
 The social limitations have been difficult.
 "It's been tough on a lot of residents not being able to see their families," Smith said. And although FaceTime calls and the staff have been great, the emotional toll felt by the residents is tough.
 That's why Chestnut Ridge has started to allow visits again.
 Residents can see loved ones in a space with a protective barrier between them. "Everybody has to wear protective equipment," Smith said, "but at least they get to see their family members."
 And, now they are starting to have lunch dates. A resident gets picked and they get to pick three other residents. Then, the four go to the dining area where each person sits by themselves at a table with four tables in the room.
 "One thing that has really come about, that we knew all along but it shows its head in all of this is the residents, yes, miss their families ... but they also miss each other," Smith said. "That cannot be minimized. They're together a lot during the day normally. Our residents eat together three times a day. They're family."
 Now the focus is becoming how to move forward.
 "Our next hurdle," Smith said, "is looking at opening back up and how that's going to look ... That is our challenge now - how we open back up safely given we know the vulnerability of our residents ... and our associates."
 In the meantime, they are grateful for the health of their residents and employees - and the tactics implemented to secure that as best as possible.
 "All that has served us well," she said. "That's not to say we've had some luck, too. I don't want to minimize that. But closing down, really adhering to our protocol and guidelines and keeping a tab on our residents, how they're doing has served us well."

The Johns Hopkins report is anticipated to be completed in July with a Community Town Hall to be scheduled shortly after. County officials have said a virtual town hall will be considered.
 In August, a request for proposals for an economic impact/feasibility study will be issued. These studies - the needs analysis, the strategic plan and the economic feasibility study - will fulfill part of the requirements as dictated by the Pennsylvania Department of Health for a county to create its own health department. Taylor said these standards must be met in order to qualify for state and federal funding.
 By winter/spring in early 2021, county officials expect to create Delco's own Board of Health and will hire a director for the health department. Other required personnel, such as an epidemiologist, will begin to be hired in the fall of 2021, with the department on track to open by the end of the year.
 Taylor said it's critical to bring all these pieces together to understand what would constitute the best health department for Delaware County.
 She noted that there are municipal health departments and conversations will occur as to what would fall under the responsibility of the municipality and what would belong to the county.
 In addition, there have been non-profit organizations who have been filling in the services normally provided by a county health department for a while, that could make great partners.
 "We don't have to reinvent the wheel," Taylor said. "We just have to make sure that we're building the right department for Delaware County."

LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests in recent days, has a message for demonstrators: "If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week."
 As more beaches, churches, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has seen more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world.
 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that "there is still a pandemic in America that's killing black and brown people at higher numbers."
 Violent protests over the death of George Floyd have shaken the country from New York City to Minneapolis, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores burned and torched cars in the streets. City officials have ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence.
 Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America.
 Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks.
 "Whether they're fired up or not, that doesn't prevent them from getting the virus," said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis.
 The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care.
 The Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections.
 "We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other," Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said.
 Even for the many protesters wearing masks, those don't guarantee protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it.
 On Sunday, many Americans were returning to in-person church services for the first time in many weeks as some emergency measures are lifted and mosques reopened across the Middle East, but in countries from India to Colombia the number of new infection was still on the rise.
 In Europe, unions in Paris flouted a ban on large gatherings Saturday to protest the dire conditions facing workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to health risks.
 Hong Kong police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to break up protests in recent weeks. A ban on gatherings of more than eight people has been extended to June 4, the day of an annual candlelight vigil to mark the Chinese military's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
 More than 6 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested.
 The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed.
 In Saudi Arabia, tens of thousands of mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered.
 In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise.
 Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area -- inaugurated by late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 -- will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories that had been allowed to operate must close. The area has reported more nearly 2,500 infections and hospitals are reaching their limits.
 Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world's richest soccer competition.
 But England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation remained precarious. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest number of confirmed virus deaths after the United States.
 "I believe this is also a very dangerous moment," he said. "We have to get this right."
 Pope Francis, meanwhile, cautioned against pessimism as people emerge from coronavirus lockdowns.
 During Mass in St. Peter's Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that "nothing will return as before." That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that "the one thing that certainly does not return is hope."

The NTP researchers exposed rats and mice to RF radiation, similar to older generation cell phones, all over their bodies at high levels and for long durations. The lowest exposure levels in the studies were equal to the maximum "local tissue exposure" allowed by current cell phone regulations.


  The research took 10 years and the results were revealing.


  The scientists found "clear evidence" of malignant tumors in the hearts of male rats, in addition to "some evidence" of tumors in their brains and adrenal glands. In a follow-up study, the researchers also found some evidence that RF was linked to DNA damage in some mice and rats.


  People who denounce RF say that these results are strong proof that cell phones and smart meters cause harm. But even the researchers themselves advise against applying these results directly to humans.

Everybody in town knew what my father sounded like, knew his distinctive baritone that was both gruff and elegant, sober — and sobering — but underneath, compassionate. They’d heard him laugh, try to whisper at meetings and fail miserably, tell funny or surreal stories about his work or his life outside activism (my favorite: He and a cousin traveling to Las Vegas in the 1950s in a rickety, non-air-conditioned van, sitting and sweating the whole way on barstool-like chairs nailed to the van floor.) As a speaker, he was definitely poetic — whether on script or off the cuff, none of the words he said at podiums were wasted or random. Always they were deeply felt. I admired that kind of efficiency, that certainty.
 As a writer my father was focused, and meticulous, which sometimes made me feel messy and undone. In my own esoteric musings about the struggle, I often feel myself veering too close to the despair or fatigue that was an anathema to him.
 But he understood those emotions. He even empathized; in his long career he had known plenty of dispirited souls. But his lens was longer and wider than mine, not least because he’d been a probation officer, and after that a human relations consultant who studied racial dynamics not from afar in an office, but in the streets. He knew with certainty that black people could live through frustration and despair and come out on the other side. He wasn’t fazed by the crises of the new age, which weren’t really new, such as the forbidding racial stereotypes that framed gangsta rap in the ’90s and aughts and became a running culture debate. His take? Many young black men wearing sagging pants and hard looks are actually vulnerable, tragically lacking in self- esteem. Though he didn’t excuse bad behavior, he cautioned against taking black people at face value, judging them chiefly on how they look (or sound). In his columns my father pushed back on that kind of devaluing, because it never went away.
 Because my father and I both wrote for newspapers about similar subjects, people in the community liked to say that I was following closely in his footsteps. I was always gratified by the idea, but found it hard to accept. I was never my father, never could be. I feel like my dog, Honey, who from the beginning of her life adored my oldest dog, Maude. When Maude died suddenly a year and half ago, Honey became the oldest. But she never filled the position of lead dog; she was simply herself, a dog of a certain age and temperament who continues to grieve for the dog before her. Though she occupies Maude’s place, she is not Maude by any stretch.

That Christmas, I gave both my parents an Apple Watch. They live in El Salvador so I can't be there physically to check-up on their health, but the Apple Watch gave me a way to at least keep tabs on their heart health from afar. The fall detection feature which calls the emergency services if you have a bad fall (on the Series 4 and Series 5), is also a nice safety blanket for aging parents.


  ## What 5 years of the Apple Watch looks like


  There's still a lot the Apple Watch can improve upon: battery life is at the top of my list, a design refresh, continue adding health features like sleep tracking and blood pressure. But it's done having to prove itself in my book. Five years later, I finally understand what the Apple Watch is for, and it's different for everyone. For me about staying connected without the added distractions, and motivating me to stay healthy despite the challenges of being a new mom. Cheers to the next five years.

Kim Zolciak's daughter showed off her natural hair and skin on Instagram, posting an extensions and make-up free selfie.


  "no hair extensions no makeup just chillin," she captioned the pic.

Why would i [sic] lie about not having makeup on..?..I'm allergic to eyelash extensions so i [sic] don't get them.

The England and Wales Cricket Board will step up plans to restart the sport behind closed doors after the British government gave the green light to return to action.
 Government officials have confirmed cricket and other sports will be able to resume from next week after the publication of health and safety guidelines designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
 The ECB will now study the document to determine how it can help the process of its sport emerging from the pandemic lockdown.
 "We are extremely heartened by Saturday's announcement from the Secretary of State, which will support the return of professional, domestic cricket behind closed doors, and provides a meaningful next step for recreational players to begin playing at their clubs again," an ECB statement said on Sunday.
 "Over the coming week, we will seek to understand the specific guidance from Government's medical teams so that we can provide support for cricket clubs who will be eager to see their communities safely playing in small groups."
 The Government's approval of stage three of the return to elite sport came only two days after the ECB pushed back the start of the domestic season until August 1.

Following his “Everything Black” tour, Arabshahi began to grow weary of only producing EDM (electronic dance music) tracks, believing they lacked the authenticity toward which he aspired. He’d spent most of his time creating accompaniment for others, straying from the spotlight. Towards the end of 2017, when he made the decision to leave the record label, he set up his DIY studio and challenged himself to put out a new song each week. He stayed inside for days, working up a storm. In 2019, Pluto Tapes Vol. 1-3 were released as an accumulation of his weekly songs.


  The songs in each album seamlessly switch between genres, freeing him from the constraints of categorization. His vocals are raw and genuine, each lyric plucked straight from his soul. The immense versatility invites a wide array of tastes and musical preferences.


  “First Generation,” from Vol. 1, is one of my favorite tracks. Despite this song being very doom and gloom, the power behind the vocals is what grabbed my attention. His voice has a soft, melancholic nature to it from the start as he reminisces about his relationship with his parents. But as the chorus nears and the song gains momentum, his vocals ring out in a desperate plea to make his parents proud, despite all the obstacles he’s faced. The chorus erupts into an epic symphony of thumping bass, distorted guitar and some unnerving background vocals which paint a clear picture of someone in distress.

I haven't always been a fan of the Apple Watch. I bought one as soon as it went on sale in 2015 hoping it would blow me away, but it ended up spending more time in my drawer than on my wrist. It took three more years and the addition of two key features -- LTE and the ECG app -- for me to finally start wearing it on a regular basis. And now it's earned a permanent spot on my wrist.

  ## The 'iWatch' has arrived


  I first started covering the Apple Watch for CNET en Español months before it officially existed. In the summer of 2014 I was hosting a weekly Apple rumor show, and there was already talk of Apple announcing an "iWatch" in the fall.


  Sure enough, after presenting the iPhone 6 at the 2014 Sept. 9 event, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced one more thing: the Apple Watch. It was by no means the first of its kind -- Samsung, Motorola and Sony, to name a few, had already launched smartwatches at this point -- but Apple hasn't always concerned itself with having the first of any product. Still, it was a brand new category for Apple, and the first of the post Steve Jobs era (Jobs died almost three years earlier).


  After the keynote, I got a chance to see it up close in the demo room. It was certainly intriguing -- I remember thinking it was one of the best-looking watches I'd seen. But the bar had been set pretty low. Most of the earlier smartwatches I'd tested were bulkier and definitely geared more toward men than women. The fact that the Apple Watch had two size options (38mm and 42mm) meant it was at least considering more than one gender. But that initial encounter was brief -- it took another eight months before I could test it in the real world.

And yet looking back now, with 17 years of hindsight, it's clear that she "needed someone to pull me out of the box I was planning to stay in for my entire life," as she put it in _What Makes a Marriage Last_. "That first year, I started seeing the beauty of the unpredictability, and realizing what he was teaching me. It was all about learning to trust Chip. I thought, Holy cow, we now have one life. I began to see the rewards of saying yes, and it tasted good. It was fun. And the next time, I would say yes quicker. I realized that Chip had great instincts and I could either hold him back or say, 'Hey, I trust you here.'"


  Leaning into the latter has spelled their success for the last two decades.


  "For my part, I've always told myself, 'I don't ever want to change Chip Gaines,'" she explained. "Because if my job as a wife was to change him, I would fail miserably. The whole point of marriage is not to change each other --it's to grow together. I always wanted to let Chip be Chip and trust that, as I was growing, he was growing, too, so that we're growing together."
