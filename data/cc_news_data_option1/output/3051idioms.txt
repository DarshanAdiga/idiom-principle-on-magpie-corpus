Meanwhile, Mitsuki mysteriously falls ill, prompting Mugino to rush him to Yubina, an eccentric medical ninja who's not affiliated with any specific country. Despite sadistically reveling in the suffering of her patients, Yubina is highly skilled at her job and manages to cure Mitsuki in a timely manner. After removing what appears to be a piece of wood from her patient's body, Yubina concludes that Mitsuki was under siege by the Hashirama Cell, which entered his body when one of his arm-snakes bit Anato. Since Mitsuki's body is considerably more resilient than that of a normal human's, his recovery won't take long, but the same can't be said for a similarly afflicted patient of Yubina's—a young woman who's been placed in stasis to slow the effects of the offending cell. As Mugino explains, the Hashirama Cell possesses special powers, and while a select few can adapt to it and obtain great strength, most people will die as a result of the Wood Style going out of control. Wishing to get to the bottom of things, Team 7 charts a course for the Land of Silence's black market, where the cells are rumored to have come from.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - The Republican primary in the race for U.S. Senate in Tennessee is getting national attention as we approach Election Day, with pundits eyeing the impact of a Trump endorsement among Republican voters.Texas Senator Ted Cruz traveled to Memphis on Monday to stump for Manny Sethi.“It’s the conservative warriors who are marching in side by side with the president, and I’m confident that’s what Manny will do,” said Cruz. “I’m proud to be here to support this campaign.”There are 15 candidates on the ballot in the race, which Politico has termed “the nastiest Republican primary in the country,” with attack ads a-plenty.Sethi, a Nashville doctor, and Bill Hagerty, a businessman and former U.S. ambassador to Japan round out the top of the ticket. Memphis doctor George Flinn is also in the race, but a poll in July showed him with 3% of the vote.Hagerty is endorsed by President Donald Trump and sitting Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn. Sethi said Monday he supports Trump, with or without the president’s direct endorsement.“You’ve got to change the culture in Washington, and right now basically, it’s a career politician, a Washington insider, versus someone who comes from outside of government, and that’s why I think the choice is very clear,” said Sethi.WMC Action News 5 political analyst Michael Nelson said Hagerty started as the front runner, but Sethi is surging late.“Somehow this Nashville surgeon Dr. Manny Sethi has been able to close the gap according to polls,” said Nelson. “The expectation was that for Republican primary voters in Tennessee, having the support of President Trump would be a game-ender, nevermind a game- changer.”The Republican Senate primary is the big-ticket item on Thursday’s election day list locally.The Shelby County Election Commission says they mailed out more than 19,000 absentee ballots because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Election officials have four new scanners in place to begin processing the absentee votes on Election Day, in what they’re calling a trial run for November. Administrator of Elections Linda Phillips said it’s possible they could receive 160,000 absentee ballot requests leading up to the November race.Officials Monday were setting up areas at the Shelby County Election Commission operations center for 60 workers to process absentee ballots in Thursday’s primary election. A typical election only requires eight absentee ballot workers, she said.“You have to be very careful when you process absentee ballots,” said Phillips. “You have to have a deliberate process, because you don’t want to scan any twice. And you don’t want to skip scanning any. So we have a very rigid process set up.”As for Hagerty, a campaign spokesperson said he will be in Memphis Tuesday at a private event. He is also scheduled to do an interview with WMC Action News 5.Copyright 2020 WMC. All rights reserved.

BOSTON - The legal market is still taking shape nearly four years since voters legalized marijuana in Massachusetts, and rules around home delivery of cannabis and access options for medical patients were at the center of the latest round of push-and-pull on Monday between the industry, medical patients and regulators.
 Aspiring entrepreneurs, medical marijuana patients and caregivers gave regulators plenty to think about during a public hearing held Monday to collect input as the Cannabis Control Commission works through at least its third phase of rule-making about three years since its inception.
 Delivery service was one area of the CCC's draft regulations for adult-use marijuana that attracted significant public comment. The commission approved a delivery license structure in the fall and made applications available in May, but has not yet licensed a delivery-only business. Several prospective cannabis delivery operators told commissioners Monday that the framework for delivery will not work as currently written.
 "We think that it's not economically viable in its current form, even though the intention behind it is very well-meaning. So to make this a viable license type, the delivery, we think there's three very important changes that should be made to the draft regulations," said Morriss Partee, president of Emerald River LLC and adviser to the Massachusetts Cannabis Association for Delivery.
 Partee and others from the MCAD said delivery licensees need the ability to purchase marijuana and marijuana products wholesale from cultivators and manufacturers. As the CCC's regulations are written, all marijuana delivered by a licensee must be sourced from a CCC-licensed retailer. They also said delivery businesses need to be allowed to store products overnight.
 "You can't talk about wholesale without talking about storage. So right now, delivery companies have to return those (unsold or declined) goods back to the retailer at the end of the day. With the ability to wholesale, it needs to be paired with warehousing or storage because those companies need to be able to store those goods overnight. And then we'll be able to take care of them, similar to a retailer," Christopher Fevry, co-founder of Your Green Package and president of MCAD, said.
 Home delivery of marijuana has long been allowed under the state's medical marijuana program, and advocates pushed for a delivery-only license in the recreational market arguing that it will help level the playing field between large corporations and small businesses because the barriers to entry for delivery are typically far less burdensome than those for retail licenses.
 Delivery licenses are available exclusively to participants in the CCC's Social Equity Program and certified economic empowerment applicants for a minimum of two years. Fevry, Partee and others told the CCC that the exclusivity period should be longer.
 "If the exclusivity period remains at two years, this will not give the commission enough time to evaluate the success or lack thereof of the delivery license since not every operator will be licensed at the start of the period, and evaluation must occur many months before the expiration date of exclusivity," Partee said. "To give yourselves enough time to evaluate the program and what changes might need to be made, please extend exclusivity to three years, with an option to renew at that point."
 The CCC's latest draft of regulations for the medical marijuana program also attracted plenty of feedback during Monday's hearing. Of particular interest was the CCC's proposal to allow medical marijuana caregivers to care for to up to 10 patients each.
 "I currently serve as a caregiver for two patients through a waiver from the commission, so I obviously support the ability for caregivers to serve more than one patient at a time. However, I do believe that placing the number at 10 is an invitation for abuse," said Jeremiah McKinnon, a member of the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance advisory board. "The commission should instead establish a case-by-case basis that determines whether or not the caregiver is suitable to serve additional patients. This process can take into consideration the public health and safety measures necessary for a caregiver to ensure proper care of multiple patients."
 Nichole Snow, the president and executive director of the MPAA, said her organization "mathematically theorized a caregiver ratio of one caregiver, 10 patients would be sufficient to provide safe access for the number of registered patients" in 2015 but said the ratio "is no longer necessary" because all adults can now legally grow their own marijuana. She said the MPAA would rather see caregivers approved to care for multiple patients on a case- by-case basis.
 "An arbitrary number of patients per caregiver will likely open the door to a gray market that is indistinguishable from the legally-regulated market you and the staff have worked so hard on developing," Snow told the commissioners Monday.
 Another MPAA official, Development Director Michael Latulippe, asked that the CCC make its executive director's bulletin allowing initial medical marijuana patient certification to take place via a telehealth appointment between the patient and a physician a permanent part of its regulations.
 "The medical program suffers from the same problems as traditional health care in communities of disproportionate impact. Additionally, patients in rural areas and patients incapacitated by their conditions are limited by this regulation. It is widely reported that veterans, victims of incarceration, and many other groups in areas of disproportionate impact suffer from post- traumatic stress and have a general anxiety towards health care, that creates social disparities in health care access for those groups," he said.
 Also included in the latest draft of the CCC's regulations is a requirement that retailers display in-store and disclose on packaging that vape products have been tested for Vitamin E acetate but may still be harmful to health regardless.
 The regulations would also allow for delivery licensees to have an interest in another license type (and vice versa), more flexibility for the CCC to add new groups to its Social Equity Program, and a new a process for the CCC to be notified of and have oversight over licensees placed under the control of a receiver by a Massachusetts court. That last regulation is necessary because bankruptcy court is not an option for businesses that are illegal at the federal level.
 The CCC will accept written comments emailed to Commission@cccmass.com until 5 p.m. Aug. 14. The commission expects to vote on the final set of regulations on Sept. 24.

Last year, SFA upset Duke on the Blue Devils' homecourt. This season the Lumberjacks will take on another blueblood of college basketball — the Kansas Jayhawks.
 On Monday, the SFA men's basketball team unveiled its premier non-conference game, a Dec. 29 contest in Lawrence, Kansas against the Jayhawks.
 The trip to Allen Fieldhouse will represent the first-ever matchup between the Lumberjacks and the Jayhawks. Both teams finished the 2019-20 season with identical 28-3 records and regular season conference titles under their belts. The 16,300 seat arena has become one of the toughest road arenas in all of college hoops, as the Jayhawks have dropped only 14 games there in the past 17 seasons.
 A time and television network for SFA's first matchup against KU has yet to be announced.
 "I am so grateful to Coach (Bill) Self for giving us the opportunity to play in Allen Fieldhouse," said SFA head coach Kyle Keller, a former Tyler Junior College coach. "It is truly the most iconic venue in all of college basketball and we're very pleased to schedule yet another milestone game for our program. I was blessed and fortunate to be able to watch and learn from Coach Self for three great years of my life. He has always been a mentor to me and is a true Hall of Famer both on and off the court. I had always hoped that when we were able to first compete, that it would be in an NCAA tournament game, but I am excited for our teams to meet each other this coming December."
 SFA's showdown with the Jayhawks will be the second matchup between the Lumberjacks and a Big 12 program in the past three seasons after SFA faced Baylor during the 2018-19 season.
 Led by Self, the Jayhawks have won one national championship, 15 Big 12 championships and amassed over 500 victories. Keller served on Self's coaching staff at Kansas from 2008-11.

The willingness to adjust has been a requirement in sports since March.
 East Carolina’s football team faced another adjustable situation Monday when pushing its morning practice to the afternoon because of lightning. The Pirates also were trying to complete their latest workout in the best time window possible ahead of the expected overnight impact of Hurricane Isaias.
 “If you’re not dealing with coronavirus stuff, you’re dealing with a hurricane,” coach Mike Houston said. “We came back and were able to get practice in this afternoon with really good energy. We had a good mixture of run, play-action pass period and an extended team period at the end with a lot of reps in today. It will be a great film to watch.”
 The Pirates might practice Tuesday afternoon, weather permitting, for the fifth straight day. They also could take the day off and regroup for later in the week.
 A highlight Monday was the intensity displayed during drills near the end of the session.
 “You had some jawing back and forth between the offense and defense, and you had some big plays by the offense and then the defense had some,” Houston said. “I can’t say normal, because we’re all out there with our masks up and kids are spread out all over the place, but it felt like more of a normal situation that we’ve had so far.”
 On Saturday, Houston was pleased with how his players handled the weekend heat compared to Friday’s first official preseason practice.
 “It was typical eastern North Carolina in August, which was good because we needed the heat,” he said. “They really pushed themselves to practice at a much higher level with much better pursuit and just pushing through and playing fast. The heat beat down on them, so there was a point in practice where they really had to make some decisions. I was really pleased with the bulk of the roster in just how they pushed through. Day 2 was a positive improvement from Day 1.”

The last time NASA astronauts returned from space to water was on July 24, 1975, in the Pacific, the scene of most splashdowns, to end a joint U.S.-Soviet mission known as Apollo-Soyuz. The Mercury and Gemini crews in the early to mid-1960s parachuted into the Atlantic, while most of the later Apollo capsules hit the Pacific. The lone Russian “splashdown” was in 1976 on a partially frozen lake amid a blizzard following an aborted mission; the harrowing recovery took hours.
 Gemini and Apollo astronaut Thomas Stafford — the commander of the last crew to splash down — watched the reentry on TV from his Florida home. While pleased with the crew’s safe return, he wasn’t overly impressed. “It’s what we did over 50 years ago,” he said.
 Its throwback splashdown aside, SpaceX made history with the mission, which launched May 30 from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. It was the first time a private company launched people into orbit and also the first launch of NASA astronauts from home turf in nearly a decade. Hurley was the pilot of NASA’s last space shuttle flight in 2011 and the commander of this SpaceX flight.
 NASA turned to SpaceX and also Boeing to build capsules and ferry astronauts to and from the space station, following the retirement of the shuttles. Until Hurley and Behnken rocketed into orbit, NASA astronauts relied on Russian rockets. SpaceX already had experience hauling cargo to the space station, bringing those capsules back to a Pacific splashdown.
 “We are entering a new era of human spaceflight where NASA is no longer the purchaser, owner and operator of all the hardware. We’re going to be a customer, one customer of many,” Bridenstine said from Johnson Space Center in Houston. “I would love to see a fleet of crew Dragons servicing not just the International Space Station but also commercial space stations.”
 SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell called the mission a springboard to “doing even harder things,” like collaborating on astronaut flights to the moon and then Mars.
 “There’s no question, it was an enormous relief after months of anxiety making sure we could bring Bob and Doug back home safely,” Shotwell said.
 SpaceX needs six weeks to inspect the capsule before launching the next crew around the end of September. This next mission of four astronauts will spend a full six months aboard the space station. Hurley and Behnken’s capsule will be refurbished for another flight next spring. A Houston company run by a former NASA official, meanwhile, has partnered with SpaceX to send three customers to the space station in fall 2021.
 “It took years to get here, we brought the capablity back to America, and we came home safely to our families, and it took a lot of people a lot of time to make that happen,” Behnken said back in Houston.
 Boeing doesn’t expect to launch its first crew until next year. The company encountered significant software problems in the debut of its Starliner capsule, with no one aboard, last year. Its capsules will touch down in the U.S. Southwest desert.
 By beating Boeing, SpaceX laid claim to a small U.S. flag left at the space station by Hurley and the rest of the last shuttle crew. Minutes after splashdown, Musk tweeted a flag emoji followed by “returned.”
 Also on board: a toy dinosaur named Tremor, sent into space by the astronauts’ young sons. The two boys recorded a wake-up call for their fathers Sunday morning.
 “Don’t worry, you can sleep in tomorrow,” said Behnken’s 6-year-old son Theo, who was promised a puppy after the flight. “Hurry home so we can go get my dog.”

HOUSTON (WLNS) - The iconic upscale clothing company with the catch phrase "You're going to like the way you look. I guarantee it," is looking to restructure the business to "evolve with the times."      "The coronavirus pandemic has altered the way we all live and work. It means fewer in-person meetings, less going out and postponed wedding celebrations," said Tailored Brands CEO Dinesh Lathi. "Simply put, people are staying home more, and our clothes are better suited to being out and about."      Tailored Brands is the parent company of Men's Wearhouse as well as other fashion brands including Jos. A. Bank, Moores Clothing for Men, and K&G brands.      The parent company announced yesterday that it has entered into a restructuring support agreement with support from more than 75% of its senior lenders.      The company filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.      Tailored Brands joins Brooks Brothers, J. Crew, Ann Taylor and Loft as well as department stores Lord & Taylor, Neiman Marcus, and J.C. Penney in recent bankruptcy filings.      The company sent a letter to Men's Wearhouse customers today that they are filing for Chapter 11 protection to help reorganize the business.      "We are creating a leaner and more nimble structure to adapt to the realities of today’s retail environment."      The letter goes on to assure rental customers that rental reservation will be ready as scheduled and the announcement does not impact ordering or production of custom suits and clothing.      The letter even provides a link to a site detailing the restructure process which includes court motions to continue paying employees and work with vendors.      In July, Tailored Brands announced 500 store closures and cutting 20% of corporate jobs, but says they will still have stores in every major metro area and in all 50 states.

The research was based on more than 375 responses from IT/information security professionals responsible for evaluating, purchasing, and managing network security technology products and services. The primary goal was to determine which organizations are seeking to implement elastic cloud gateway (ECG solutions), and the trigger points for influencing network security investments. It examined the impact that cloud, mobility and distributed environments have on edge network security strategy. An ECG is a cloud- delivered solution that consolidates multiple edge network security controls into a unified solution offering centralized management and distributed enforcement.
 These are multi-mode solutions that provide elasticity around both services and consumption to better align security with how organizations are leveraging cloud resources overall. Rather than inspecting traffic via an appliance deployed at branch office/remote office locations, or routing back to the security stack at the main campus, traffic is sent directly to the internet where it is inspected. When deployed effectively, ECGs will help organizations converge tools to drive consistent policy, create operational efficiencies, and ultimately, help reduce the attack surface.

"The point is that some elements of some historic properties are nearly irreplaceable," Bland said Monday. "So you don't want those historic elements to deteriorate to the point that you lose them."
 As City Manager Stuart Bedenbaugh succinctly put it, no wrecking ball is coming through. Law echoed both Bland and Bedenbaugh, emphasizing a demolition by neglect decree is more defensive than offensive.
 "It doesn't give us any authority to demolish structures," the Design Review Board chairman said. "It protects structures."
 The matter, though, is on the board's radar because Malia Koelker, the owner of Malia's Restaurant, late last month messaged Bland and Bedenbaugh, among other officials, about "the continuing deterioration and misuse" of Hotel Aiken and adjacent properties and the "troublesome" repercussions in the immediate area.
 "I understand that the City's Design Review Board has the authority to issue a 'demolition by neglect inquiry' and I respectfully request that the board moves forward with issuing this inquiry," Koelker wrote. Her message was included in the Design Review Board's Tuesday meeting materials.
 The contemporary Hotel Aiken story has been a long, languid, winding one.
 In December 2017, owner Neel Shah announced the hotel would come under the Courtyard by Marriott wing, would be renovated and expanded to the tune of $11 million, and would retain local ownership. The rebooted Hotel Aiken, Shah said, would in a boutique manner blend the landmark lodging's 1900s provenance and charm with modern accommodations.

The Spaniard was signed from Sevilla as a teenager in 2005 and was still young when he was joined at the club by Van der Vaart, who stayed at the Santiago Bernabeu for two seasons before joining Tottenham in 2010.
 However, having watched on as his old club secured the title once again, the Dutchman is impressed by how Ramos has matured and, considering his physical condition, sees no reason why the 34-year-old should be thinking of retiring anytime soon.
 "For me, he is the best defender in the world," Van der Vaart said.
 "When I was at Real Madrid, he was 21 or 22 and bursting with energy. He wanted to be everywhere. Free kicks, corner kicks, everywhere.
 "Now it is different, he has so much focus now. A focus on winning and he uses all his talents for that purpose. He's aware of his skills, strength and conditioning and that helped him being so important for his team in winning already so many titles. His body is unbelievable, he is a machine.
 "When I was watching a game the other day, I thought, 'how old is he? 34?' I believe he can still be playing for another six years, I've so much respect for him."
 With LaLiga won, Madrid will now focus on potential European success as they return to Champions League action.
 It need to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit in its last-16 tie with Manchester City if it is to progress, with the remaining knockout rounds to be staged in Portugal, though Ramos will miss the match against Pep Guardiola's team at the Etihad Stadium due to suspension.
 However, Madrid have been outstanding since the season restarted in Spain midway through June, and Van der Vaart expects a "really interesting" return clash with City, who finished second in the Premier League.
 "Real Madrid have been very, very good after the coronavirus break," he said. "They have all been very focused [on the games]. Including a 10-game winning streak.
 "Karim Benzema and Ramos have been a key part of the team for me, and Zidane for bringing calmness to the team.
 "However, I watched Manchester City against Arsenal playing the semi-final of the FA Cup, as well as other games. They have so much individual talent, so they are always dangerous, for any team, including the magnificent Real Madrid. That's what we've seen in the first leg, so it is going to be a really interesting game."
 Van der Vaart was speaking as part of a Europa League Trophy Tour that has been collecting football boots from fans for Syrian refugees based in Jordan, a cause the former Netherlands international is passionate about.
 "It's great, I remember how incredibly happy I was as a little boy with my football boots. I even put my first pair on to bed and I dreamed of playing football. I hope that all children in the world may experience that kind of childlike joy. I'm so proud that I can help a little bit," Van der Vaart said.
 "We are collecting boots, which hopefully gives a bit more hope and fun for all children. So, I'm proud that I can help a little bit and be a part of it.
 "It's really important [to be able to go out and play]. Now there are so many things, but when I was little you would just go on the street and play.
 "In lockdown it was difficult, of course. You want to meet with friends, you want to go out and play games, but when I started playing it was just me and the ball."

The league's extensive protocols for holding the season included banning high- fives and spitting by players and keeping fans out of stadiums. But teams are still traveling the country to play games in empty stadiums and are not isolated from the general American public.
 In contrast, the NHL, NBA and WNBA have restarted their leagues without positive tests by holding all games in "bubbles," where players are consistently tested, are required to masks and remain apart from the public.
 Manfred has said that holding the baseball season in a "bubble" would not have worked because MLB has large teams and wants to hold a 60-game season.
 "The duration would have been much longer, and the longer you go, the more people you have, the less likely it is that you can make the bubble work," he said.

You can't fault the NFL players who have decided to opt out of the 2020 NFL season. The reasoning is clear -- those players wanted to protect themselves, their parents, their children and, in a couple of cases, their unborn children from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Patriots have had a league-high eight opt-outs with Dont'a Hightower, Patrick Chung, Marcus Cannon, Brandon Bolden, Matt LaCosse, Dan Vitale, Marqise Lee and Najee Toran all deciding to take that route. But even for the players who opted to play, they admit the decision wasn't easy.

 On Sunday, four Patriots captains explained why they are playing this year. They admitted the choice play wasn't easy, but they're heading into the season trying to remain optimistic. One of those players is David Andrews.
 No one would have been surprised if the Patriots center opted out. Last year, he missed the season due to blood clots in his lungs. He said after discussing his choices with his family and doctors, he is all-in for 2020.
 "My choice has been made," Andrews said. "Talking with doctors and my wife -- it's something we feel comfortable with. I'm just excited to get the chance to go out there and compete again."
 Andrews' situation is a rare one, but he isn't the only player who's dealt with health issues. Cannon is a survivor of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. When he opted out, it wasn't a surprise. Although it's a blow anytime you lose your right tackle, having Andrews back at center will help the Patriots move forward.
 Matthew Slater also has his own medical condition and reasons that would have made it understandable if he chose to opt out. The 34-year-old deals with asthma and has three small children at home. It was reported by the NFL Network that Slater nearly opted out. Slater's wife, Shahrzad, is a Providence-based doctor and he admitted the choice to play was really difficult after speaking with her.
 "With my wife having the background that she does as an MD, I think that she knows a little bit more and it made the conversation a little bit tougher," Slater said. "Obviously, my parents have their own concerns. I have a young family that I'm trying to raise. … It's been difficult. You want to make sure you're hearing from the Lord and doing what he wants you to do. You don't want to be selfish. You don't want to be just acting just on the spur of the moment or off emotions, whether it be fear or excitement, whatever it might be. We tried to be as prayerful about this as we could. We feel at a place of peace now. I think it's just a matter of us moving forward, continuing to pray and continue to support my family at 1 Patriot Place, continue to support the Slater family. There is no easy decision for this."
 Having the captain and Pro Bowl special-teamer back is important for the Patriots. The same goes for James White and Devin McCourty. White's wife, Diana, gave birth to their first child last season and she's currently pregnant again. McCourty and his wife, Michelle, have two children under 4.
 White is one of the best receiving backs in the NFL. After losing Chung, McCourty's services are certainly needed in the Patriots secondary. The team is certainly happy they're playing, but both recognize that the decision wasn't clear cut.
 "It's definitely not an easy decision," White said. "Little one at home, my wife is pregnant, so definitely a lot of consideration. It's definitely not an easy choice like Slate was saying. I don't want to be selfish knowing you love and want to play the game. But we want to protect our families at home, our teammates and coaches and everybody. Definitely a difficult choice, but I feel like we're trying to take the right steps and follow the precautions at the stadium.
 "We'll trust in one another to do the right things outside the locker room so we don't bring any unnecessary things into the locker room. At the same time, we all can do the right things and stuff still can happen. Just have to be as cautious as possible. Just keep everybody trusting in one another so we can all be safe."
 Players have a deadline to opt out (the date is either this Wednesday or Saturday) and anyone could change their mind.
 "I'm still out here having fun and figuring things out," McCourty said. "So, we'll see how we go."
