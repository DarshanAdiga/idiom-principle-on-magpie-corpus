It’s not uncommon for South Asian pundits to describe conservative Islam as “Arabized” or its practitioners wearing “Arab-like clothes”. The view from the Middle East is quite different. A 2009 New York Times story about the rise of Salafism in Gaza describes a group of Salafi men as, “On the streets of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, clusters of men wear long tunics over baggy trousers, a costume common in Pakistan but virtually unknown among Palestinians”. In Charles Lister’s book _The Syrian Jihad_, the extremist Abu al-Qaqaa (aka Mahmoud Ouul al-Ghassi) is described as “dressing like a Pakistani”. A lot of this comes from the anti-Soviet Jihad when the Arabs came to Pakistan and adapted some of the local practices. Cultural influence is a two-way street.

Among the biggest problems for cricketers is the use of saliva on the ball. The International Cricket Council (ICC), on the recommendation of its cricket committee headed by former India captain Anil Kumble, temporarily banned the use of saliva to minimize the risk of virus infection. The bowlers, especially pacers, all over the world didn't like the suggestion. But there is probably a solution to the problem, for training purposes at least.

Republican staffers on the House Energy & Commerce   Committee weighed in with their own memo in advance of the Feb. 4 Comcast-NBC Universal   merger hearing, warning Republican members not to let regulators, competitors   or "public interest" groups (italics theirs) "to extort from   Comcast and NBC Universal a wish-list of conditions they have failed to justify   as industry-wide regulations."
 That follows yesterday's memo from Democratic staffers   talking about all their concerns about the deal's potential anticompetitive   effects.
 The Republicans are looking at the same deal but see it   quite differently. "No condition is warranted unless it is narrowly   tailored to a transaction-specific harm to competition," the staffers   wrote, according to a copy of the memo. "Since the deal will not   materially increase horizontal concentration in either the distribution or   programming markets, demonstrating such harms will be difficult, especially in   light of the robust competition in the video sector."
 Comcast has argued that its share of the online video   market is miniscule and that the overall market is extremely competitive.
 "As competitive as this market is, regulatory   intervention is not only unnecessary, it will hurt competition and consumers,   especially in this economy," wrote the Republican staffers. "The longer   the review takes, the longer the fate of NBC Universal, its employees, and its   viewers will hang in the balance."
 Those "public interest" groups have been urging   the FCC and Justice to take their time with the review and pay particular   attention to access to online video, which they argue the new company would   have the ability and incentive to restrict in favor of their own platforms.
 Reading   from the same page as Comcast, the Republicans advise that the deal is unlikely   to have any competitive impact since the two companies' markets do not   materially overlap. They echo Comcast's point that none of its cable nets are   in the top 30 most highly rated and have only a fraction of the cable ad   market.
 They argue that Comcast's vertical integration is not an   issue because the combined company will not have market power in either   programming or distribution.
 The Republicans argue that NBC will still have to compete   with at least three other broadcast networks with affiliates in almost every   market, and Comcast will still be competing against DirecTV and Dish, as well   as cable overbuilders and telcos.
 They argue against any network neutrality provision, saying   it would hinder investment and would not be transaction-specific since   "nothing in the deal would increase Comcast's market power over   broadband."
 To round out the shout-out to Comcast-NBCU, the Republicans   advise against any conditions on retransmission consent, program-access or access   to regional sports. They also say the company has already volunteered   sufficient public interest obligations, including ones that address access to   programming and program diversity.

 Panasonic has announced that it is finally ready to dip into the 4K OLED market, with the arrival of the TX-65CZ950.
 The CZ950 is a 65-inch OLED stunner, offering up the high picture quality you expect with OLED, but also screen quality that has been given the seal of approval by Hollywood.
 The TV is the first OLED to be given THX certification. This is the quality control certificate first introduced by George Lucas in the Seventies.
 If that wasn't enough 'star' power, Panasonic has made good use of its Hollywood laboratory and offered up its OLED TV lineup to people in the industry to make sure the panel in reference ready.
 ## Colour corrected
 One of these was on the stage at IFA - Mike Sowa, who worked on Tom Cruise's Oblivion as a colourist.
 "We always translate our colour grade movie on to a reference television, to make sure that we perfectly match what is going on in the cinema," said Sowa.
 "That is where Panasonic stepped in with its new OLED TV. This TV is what I have been looking for. The detail is better than I am used to seeing in the theatrical version.
 "We can now enjoy the visual product in the home as the cinematographer and director intended."
 Panasonic's picture quality is the way it is because of the company's 4K Pro technology, which promises high contrast and rich colour expression that should stop you pining for the Panasonic plasma TVs of yore.
 The CZ950 will be available from October. Pricing is to be announced but, hey, you've probably good two kidneys, so it might be worth pricing one of them up.

Last Monday, Pat Dye passed away. For those of you who don't remember, he was head coach of the Auburn University football team from 1981 to 1992. I almost cannot believe that I typed "for those of you who don't remember," but there's a reason I did. I've been surprised how little mention has been made of the passing of someone who made such an impact on the Auburn University community.
   
 I shouldn't be surprised at all. I spend most of my time in the company of 18- to 20 year-olds, and I've been in the classroom long enough now to know how little students know of recent history. They're often nearly completely ignorant of events that happened right before they were born, and Coach Dye's accomplishments are no exception.
   
 A few years ago, a student of mine referred to herself in writing as a "diehard Auburn fan." I commented, "Aren't you a Dye-hard Auburn fan?" Not only had she never heard the catchphrase, she was a little uncertain of why I had "misspelled" it and asked me about it. When I explained it, she got it, but I'm still not sure she would have put it together without that explanation. She had never really known any Auburn head football coaches other than Gene Chizik and Gus Malzahn, and barely remembered Tommy Tuberville.
   
 I understand. I can remember Coach Ralph "Shug" Jordan ... barely. Doug Barfield, who coached Auburn in the five years between Coach Jordan and Coach Dye, I remember more clearly -- I was watching football then, but wasn't truly conversant enough to know more about the head coach other than his name. Coach Dye will always be the Auburn head coach that I first remember since I was truly engaged with football fandom by the time he took over.
   
 And, after all, I sometimes have had to explain to young Alabama Crimson Tide fans why houndstooth is a thing for them. Seriously.
   
 Coach Dye's death brought a flood of memories back to me. He came to one of Etowah High School's football games once -- to scout a player on the other team. There's a photograph of Coach Dye with several Etowah students in the 1984 Etowahian annual. He has a big smile on his face -- he's obviously enjoying himself -- and a pen in his hand -- he'd obviously been signing autographs. Coach Dye is looking directly at the camera, but most of the students are looking away to the right. There is no caption at all to identify him. Every Etowah student who bought a copy of that annual knows who he is, but I wonder if their children and grandchildren looking at the annual in 50 years will.
   
 My most vivid memory of Coach Dye is the 1982 Iron Bowl, the game usually referred to as the "Bo Over the Top" game. Bo Jackson, the 1985 Heisman Trophy winner, leapt over the Alabama Crimson Tide defensive line at the goal line to score the go-ahead touchdown that ended up being the margin of victory.
   
 People not native to the state of Alabama often don't realize how intense football fandom is here, especially in regard to the annual rivalry game between Auburn and Alabama. If you're born in Alabama, you grow up pulling for either Auburn or Alabama. There is very little middle ground.
   
 I was 14 (about to be 15) in 1982 -- a "Dye-hard" Auburn fan already, although the catchphrase wasn't yet around -- but I had never really known an Auburn victory in the Iron Bowl. The last one had been in 1972, the famous "Punt Bama Punt!" game in which Auburn, behind 16-3 in the last 10 minutes of the game, blocked two Alabama punts and returned each for a touchdown, winning 17-16. Since I was only 4 (about to be 5) then, I don't remember that game at all.
   
 Auburn had lost to Alabama for nine long years -- still the longest losing streak in the Iron Bowl rivalry -- and that's what I remember. Auburn's win was very sweet to me. That's why I'll always remember Coach Dye -- he put together that team and coached them to victory. Over the remainder of his coaching career at Auburn, he and his Tigers won five more Iron Bowls, including a four-game streak from 1986 to 1989.
   
 In the obituary in The Gadsden Times on Tuesday, Josh Vitale of the Montgomery Advertiser told a Pat Dye story I'd never heard, but I loved it. Vitale wrote, "When Dye interviewed for the job, he was asked by a member of the search committee, 'How long will it take you to beat Alabama?' His reply, famously, was '60 minutes.'"
   
 That story is telling for what it reveals about Pat Dye, the leader. Coach Dye was thinking of the game in essentially different terms than the search committee. He knew that no matter how long one prepares to win the big game -- days, weeks, months, years -- the big game itself is 60 minutes. That's how long you have to win it or lose it.
   
 To Coach Dye's family, my condolences. To Coach Dye, thank you and may you rest in peace.

They are generally the result of a person's actions and could have been avoided.
