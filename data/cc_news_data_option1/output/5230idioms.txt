The National Pension System, introduced as the default retirement scheme for Central government employees in 2004 and extended to all Indian citizens in 2009, has attained some key milestones. Assets managed by it rose by 35 per cent in the past year surpassing the ₹5-lakh-crore mark in October. While government employees still dominate the scheme at over 70 lakh subscribers, the corporate and all-citizens models now feature over 24 lakh investors. But these numbers are still minuscule compared to the size of India’s 40-crore workforce. Given the lack of social security net for most employed folk and the looming risk of under-funded retirement, the NPS is in urgent need of policy tweaks to render it attractive to young savers.
 Starting out as a complex and heavily taxed product, the NPS has been tweaked several times in recent years to make it more investor friendly. Relaxation in early withdrawal rules, flexibility to subscribers to stay on after 60 and tax breaks on 60 per cent of maturity proceeds are some useful changes. But there’s still some way to go before the scheme can be on par with competing products. Subscribers to NPS are required to route their transactions through designated Points of Presence (PoPs). Though the scheme boasts leading banks, brokerages and NBFCs among its 81 PoPs, these agencies make only token attempts to market the scheme, preferring to push high-cost ULIPs and mutual funds to their customers instead. This is despite the NPS commission structure being revised over the years. Having introduced electronic account opening and direct remittance of contributions, the NPS should now consider completely disintermediating all subscriber interactions, so that they can bypass PoPs. On costs, while the scheme’s management fee has been kept ultra-low at 0.01 per cent, a host of charges to compensate distributors, the record-keeping agency and custodial services have been added on. These should ideally be bundled into a single expense ratio as is the case with mutual funds. Levying early exit penalties may be a better way to deter subscribers from premature withdrawals than imposing conditions on end-use of such funds. The compulsory annuitisation feature, which forces subscribers to mandatorily purchase low- return and tax-inefficient annuity products with their retirement proceeds is one of the biggest irritants in the NPS. The scheme should instead offer annuities as an option and allow subscribers to decide on the parking grounds for their retirement kitty as the Public Provident Fund and Employee Provident Fund do. Though Central government employees make up the scheme’s mainstay they have fewer choices than private subscribers on asset allocation, which needs to be remedied.
 The time appears right for the pension regulator or NPS Trust to launch a public consultation process on the scheme’s features. They should then be overhauled at one go, instead of being tweaked in a piecemeal fashion, confusing subscribers.

GRAND HAVEN -- Ottawa County Prosecuting Attorney Ronald Frantz retires at the end of this month as the county's longest-serving prosecuting attorney, having held the elected position for 30 years.
   
 At 71 years old, and after 43 total years with the Ottawa County Prosecutor's Office, Frantz said he felt it was time to hand over the reins to someone new. He announced in mid-2019 that he would not seek re-election.
   
 His chief assistant prosecutor, Lee Fisher, will take his place in January. Fisher was elected to his first four-year term in the office in November.
   
 "I've been able to observe Ron and work with him for the last 30 years," Fisher said. "As people who live in Ottawa County, we are all very fortunate to have had him as our elected prosecutor for the last 30 years. He has done an amazing job, so much so that he's never really had a serious challenger for the position."
   
 Victims rights and DNA
   
 Reflecting on changes in the prosecutor's office over the years, Frantz said a crucial shift has been the recognition of crime victims' rights, which he credits to the work of the late William Van Regenmorter, a state legislator who penned Michigan's Crime Victims Rights Act of 1985.
   
 "When I started in the office, the victims unfortunately were not treated well by the system. In the case of domestic violence, the courts sometimes required that the victims post a bond to pursue a case against the batterer, which is ridiculous," Frantz said.
   
 The legislation gave crime victims the right to be notified and consulted during the judicial process, for example before a plea bargain is offered to a defendant. Crime victims are also entitled to restitution under the legislation.
   
 "We now have five people in the office whose responsibilities are to deal with crime victims," Frantz said. "Making crime victims central to the cases is just a huge difference in the way things have been done."
   
 "They're consulted and they have a voice, and that's big."
   
 DNA analysis also changed the game for perpetrator identification in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
   
 Frantz was the first in the state to use the then-new technology to help secure the conviction of Gregory DuJardine for the rape of an Ottawa County park attendant in a 1989 jury trial.
   
 He recalled the county spent about $10,000 -- "a lot of money in 1989" -- to bring in researchers and experts from New York and California to convince a judge to allow the DNA evidence in court.
   
 "We had a pretty powerful circumstantial case but we didn't have absolute identification," Frantz said. "She (the victim) didn't know him. So the DNA evidence made a huge difference."
   
 Within the prosecutor's office, Frantz instituted a job-sharing program which allowed attorneys to continue their careers in the office part-time while caring their families.
   
 Ottawa County judges Susan Jonas, Karen Miedema and Judy Mulder all took advantage of the job-sharing program when they were prosecutors under Frantz, he noted.
   
 "I think it gave some people who really wanted to have a long career in prosecution or in public service or as a judge an opportunity to stay engaged instead of take the traditional role of quitting and raising and family and trying to come back later," Frantz said.
   
 Fisher will 'hit the ground running'
   
 Fisher, who Frantz described as "eminently qualified" to follow him in office, has more than three decades of experience in prosecution, first as a prosecutor in St. Joseph County, Michigan, before he became -- coincidentally -- Frantz's first hire after taking office in Ottawa County.
   
 "As the years have gone on, he's been successively responsible for more and more in the office, and I think he's definitely going to hit the ground running," Frantz said.
   
 Fisher said he and Frantz agreed, after Frantz announced his retirement, that he should run for office.
   
 Frantz himself was one of Fisher's first endorsements and paved the way, Fisher said, for a smooth campaign without any opponents.
   
 "That kind of support I think was key, because I think it kept other people from maybe jumping in to run against me when they saw the type of people that were supporting me and the type of support I have," Fisher said.
   
 These days, it is the growth of domestic violence and child sexual abuse in the county that worries Frantz as his time as the chief law enforcement official in the county comes to a close.
   
 "As I leave and turn this over to Lee, I think the one thing that concerns me is that we have not been terribly effective at reducing domestic violence numbers. They're still way too high," Frantz said.
   
 "When you have 600 domestic violence cases year after year after year, that's hard to accept."
   
 Fisher said his goal in office is to continue to build on Frantz's work. That includes a focus on serving crime victims, maintaining public safety and protecting children.
   
 A career prosecutor
   
 One of Frantz's hopes for his legacy is that more young attorneys are encouraged to make prosecution a career, rather than a stepping stone to a different job.
   
 Frantz's office made it a priority to hire people who were committed to staying in the field, a practice Fisher hopes to continue in his hiring decisions.
   
 "I'd like to see more people make prosecution a career like Lee and I have," Frantz said.
   
 "As it turns out, I think I'm the first prosecutor in Ottawa County history to retire in office and not go on to another career in some other aspect of law. ... It means a lot to me that people have really seen the benefit to a long- term service in the prosecutor's office."

Pakistan captain Babar Azam, who is recovering from a thumb injury, could miss the opening Test against New Zealand at Mount Maunganui beginning December 26.
 Babar, who has been Pakistan’s top run-scorer across all three formats since 2019, suffered a fracture in his thumb during a throw-down session in Queenstown on December 12 which ruled him out of the three-match T20I series.
 Pakistan has also lost opener Imam-ul-Haq due to a thumb fracture. Imam has been advised a 12-day rest.
 Babar’s absence a major setback for Pakistan, says Waqar Younis      “Babar is under rehab and has done some light training but whether he will be 100% match fit in time for the first Test is a long shot,” an official aware of the developments in New Zealand said.
 Pakistan, led by vice-captain Shadab Khan, lost the first T20 in Auckland on Friday. The Pakistan squad had to undergo an extended 14-day quarantine period in Christchurch after around 10 players tested positive for COVID-19 with four diagnosed as historical cases and six new infections.
 Babar Azam ruled out of New Zealand T20s with fractured thumb.
 If Babar is not fit in time for the first Test, wicketkeeper-batman Muhammad Rizwan will lead the side as he was named Test vice-captain before the tour.

Maher said the loss of “auxiliary” revenues from housing, meals and event attendance could create a significant drain on the university system if the trend toward online learning continues as expected after the pandemic subsides. Businesses in cities where universities are located will also see lost business if the online shift continues or picks up pace.
 “What does it mean to us if enrollment continues to go down or if our students aren’t learning on campus?” Maher said. “What does it mean to us in terms of lost revenue from a housing perspective, from a meal-plan perspective, from an attendance at athletic events perspective? There are a lot of pieces that go into that auxiliary budget that are still unknown, and we don’t know the impact of those losses yet.”
 Instructors and students say that teaching and learning by computer over the internet added another stressor during the pandemic, especially for professors who were not familiar with teaching remotely and students unfamiliar with online learning.
 Almost all colleges and universities in South Dakota took steps to provide safe in-person learning by requiring or urging use of masks, creating additional space for social distancing and reducing class sizes through hybrid courses.
 Research into the effectiveness of online learning remains unsettled, though some students and instructors question whether something critical is lost by not holding classes in person.
 “It’s no secret students don’t learn as well online,” Augustana student Jenifer Fjelstad, a 20-year-old junior journalism and French major, wrote to News Watch in an email. “Online learning feels like going through the motions to get an assignment done or get a certain grade, but in-person learning lets me lean into my natural interest about the subject and really learn.”
 Dakota State University professor Mark Geary, president of the statewide faculty union, had experience with teaching online before the pandemic and said he had success doing so during the fall.
 But Geary acknowledged that online teaching is “a complicated process to do it well and keep everyone engaged.”
 Geary said some students would get distracted by roommates playing loud music or playing video games that ate up bandwidth and reduced connectivity. Geary and others also lament that online learning reduces the personal connection between teacher and student that can lead to educational breakthroughs.
 “It’s really challenging to build your student relationships in your online classes,” he said.
 Geary said he was able to use online teaching platforms that encouraged creativity, such as an assignment that prompted students to create a theoretical habitat on the planet Mars.
 He noted that given the uncertainty of the pandemic, the rapid shift to online teaching and the fact that some students were in quarantine at times, he shifted his grading standards down somewhat.
 Some administrators and students said online learning eliminates critical elements of the traditional on-campus experience, such as learning to live and work with others, including peers from diverse backgrounds, and networking opportunities and relationship-building that can aid in career advancement later.
 Shifting too far toward online learning could also lessen the value of some degrees, particularly those that require students to have hands-on, experiential learning, said Barry Dunn, president of South Dakota State University.
 Dunn said he believes the use of technology will continue to expand in college courses but will never supersede the value of in-person, on-campus teaching in many subject areas.
 “You want your nurse to have gone through a nursing program with hands-on clinical experiences, right? That’s just fundamental,” Dunn said. “I’d personally rather have somebody designing a bridge who had worked in face-to- face courses.”
 Despite steady decreases in face-to-face learning, several administrators said the pandemic may actually heighten interest among students who want to live and learn on campus and could reverse the online trend somewhat. They also think that the experience with teaching remotely to stay safe during the pandemic will lead to more use of technology that enhances rather than replaces in-person learning.
 Ben Iverson, enrollment director at Augustana University, said the school surveyed students over the summer and found they “resoundingly” preferred the on-campus learning experience.
 “So that will continue to be the core of what we do here at Augustana,” Iverson said, “even if at times we integrate or blend technology into the teaching experience.”
 South Dakota Mines engineering student Andrew Ward, 20, said he found hybrid courses to be the most effective, but added that he benefited from online lessons that allowed him to go back and review tapes of lectures on concepts he didn’t fully understand the first time around.

During the 2017-2018 school year, Alabama’s Poet Laureate Jennifer Horne, was writer-in-residence at Lenoir-Rhyne University. “I’m always hungry for good conversation with another writer,” Beverly stated.

Beverly was working on a book of poems, “Bearing Witness,” which was published in 2019 by Third Lung Press. Jennifer read the manuscript, offered helpful feedback, and suggested that in addition to Beverly’s work being published, there should be other ways to get her work out.
 Besides Jennifer’s advice, which remained on Beverly’s mind as 2020 dragged on, there was Beverly’s cache of scrapbooking supplies and materials she’d assembled for crafting notecards. She began folding 8-by-8-inch pieces of card stock that was colorful on one side, white on the other. The 4-by-8s would fit nicely in business envelopes. She added her own designs and bits and pieces to the existing design of each piece of paper, affixed a poem title, and then on the inside included one of her poems. On the envelope, she printed “Free Poem.”

We finally got to see the confrontation between Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and his Dark Troopers and Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) that I’ve been hyping for a month now, and it largely delivered. (I can’t believe I accurately predicted how the fight would go) We got to see more of Pedro Pascal’s face in a fairly poignant goodbye scene (though for my money the fake-out we got back in “The Jedi” hit the emotions a bit more). And we got to see Luke _by God_ Skywalker show up in his X-Wing to save the day at the end, take Grogu as his student, and look vaguely disturbing because they still haven’t really nailed that de-aging CGI yet.

El Movimiento Socialista de los Trabajadores realizó un acto en Plaza de Mayo, con críticas al Gobierno y con un llamado al Frente de Izquierda para construir una alternativa electoral el año próximo.Los principales dirigentes, Alejandro Bodart, Celeste Fierro y Vilma Ripoll, estuvieron acompañados por la militancia del partido, junto a trabajadores del Hospital Garrahan, de LATAM, vecinos de Guernica, agrupaciones feministas que pelean por el derecho al aborto legal y referentes del movimiento socioambiental.“Este año estuvo signado por un brutal ajuste y ya tienen un nuevo pacto con el FMI. Por eso la entrega y sumisión al imperialismo será moneda corriente y significará más ajuste, como lo vemos ahora con las jubilaciones”, afirmó al cierre Celeste Fierro.Y convocó al resto de las fuerzas del FIT, Partido Obrero, Izquierda Socialista, PTS, a “ser una verdadera alternativa electoral” para las elecciones legislativas de 2021.“Tenemos que ir mucho más allá de un frente electoral, superarlo positivamente y esforzarnos por ampliar más y más esta unidad.

Warnock knew early on that he wanted to enter the ministry.

ATLANTA (AP) — In 2008, when Barack Obama was under fire for a sermon his former pastor delivered years earlier, the aspiring president distanced himself from the preacher’s fiery words that channeled Black Americans’ anger over racism.
 The Rev. Raphael Warnock defended Jeremiah Wright. “When preachers tell the truth, very often it makes people uncomfortable,” he said on Fox News.
 Now Warnock is the politician running for office and the one under attack for his sometimes impassioned words from the pulpit. And once again, he is not backing down. Warnock, 51, says his run for U.S. Senate in Georgia — one of two races on Jan. 5 that will determine control of the Senate — is an extension of his years of progressive activism as head of the church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached.
 Warnock is calling for bail reform and an end to mass incarceration; a living wage and job training for a green economy; expanded access to voting and health care, and student loan forgiveness. It’s an unabashedly liberal platform that may galvanize the Democrats he needs to turn out to vote in the runoff election.
 But it also carries risks. His opponent, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, has blasted his rhetoric and proposals as “radical,” socialist and out of step with Georgia residents. It’s a line of attack that could sway moderate suburban voters in a state that hasn’t elected a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years.
 “I’m a pastor who is running for political office, but I don’t think of myself as a politician,” he told The Associated Press. “I honestly don’t know anything to be other than authentic.”

Warnock would join a small group of other ministers in Congress, including at least one other Black pastor, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. He said his model was King, “who used his faith to activate change in the public square.” In high school, he listened to the civil rights icon's sermons and was particularly drawn to “A Knock At Midnight,” in which King exhorts churches to serve as the “critic of the state” and fight for peace and economic and racial justice.
 Warnock has embraced that mission. In 2007, he warned that the U.S. could “lose its soul” in a speech that condemned President George W. Bush's decision to send more troops to Iraq. At the Georgia Capitol in 2014, he was arrested while protesting the refusal of state Republicans to expand Medicaid. After the killing of George Floyd by police in May, he expounded on the country's struggle with a “virus” he dubbed “COVID-1619” for the year when some of the first slaves arrived in English North America.
 His campaign draws heavily from his early life. Warnock grew up poor in public housing in Savannah, Georgia. He cites his father's small business hauling old cars to a local steel yard to push back on attacks he is against free enterprise.
 He attended Morehouse College and earned a Ph.D. in theology from Union Theological Seminary, funding his education with help from student loans and federal grants. His older brother Keith, one of 11 siblings, served more than 20 years in prison for a first-time, drug-related offense, and Warnock has used his case to argue for criminal justice reform.
 "He knew what it is to struggle. He knew what it is to go without," Bishop Reginald T. Jackson, a leader of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Georgia, said of Raphael Warnock, whom he supports. “He’s able to speak to where a lot of people are.”
 Warnock knew early on that he wanted to enter the ministry. His father was also a preacher, and enlisted his son at a young age to help him read the small print in a biblical reference book because he refused to get prescription glasses.

I don't remember the year, I was maybe 8.   It was right before my single mother hooked a good job that would change things.   iow, we were flat broke.      My Mom took the five foot wood A ladder and tied greenery to one side along with lights. I thought it was a super cool idea, and the steps were perfect for putting presents on (it occurred to me much later it worked that well because gifts were small and limited that year).      Did I mention cold? Frigid for our area and the heater for the house ran on kerosene. Which was expensive and thus, there was none.      Mom suggested we camp in front of the fireplace and I nodded off snug in a sleeping bag, toasty.      Sometime that night I opened my eyes and saw the living room wall I was facing was BRIGHT orange. Way, way too bright and my bag was stiffling. Groggy I watched mom drag a large, flaming log out of the fireplace and out into the yard and turn the hose on it standing barefoot in her nightgown shivering and swearing      Turned out that log had been treated with kreosote and we'd had a close call.      The other "most" memorable was ours as newlyweds. I gave him a list of things I might like and he went out and bought every damn thing on it. Never had been spoiled like that. He was a grinning fool.      By far the most outstanding of all lasted thirty seconds. The last day of work before the holiday, perfect weather, a great car under my hands, the Nutcracker in the CD player....I downshifted into a turn and a flock of Ibis startled into flight against the sky blue pink of dawn as if on cue. Sugar plum fairies indeed.

“A few of the kangaroos approached me and started sniffing my knee and scratching my knee,” he added. “If it was a dog you’d call it pawing.”
 Ten of the 11 kangaroos involved in the study actively looked at McElligott, and nine alternated between looking at him and the box containing the food.
 “They were really trying to intentionally communicate their desire to get him to help get the food out of the box,” said Alexandra Green, an animal behavior and welfare researcher at the University of Sydney, who is the paper’s co- author.
 Green says she believes that the kangaroo’s behavior is a modification of how they communicate with one another in the wild.

Neymar is “expected” to make his return from an ankle injury next month, Paris Saint-Germain announced on Saturday.
 PSG coach Thomas Tuchel had said he was hoping Neymar might be fit to play a part in Sunday’s clash with Ligue 1 leaders Lille, but the Parisians said in a statement the Brazil attacker would be out until the New Year.
 “There is some bruising to the bone and he continues to undergo treatment at the training ground,” the French champions said in a statement.
 “He is expected to make his return in January.”
 That would see the world’s most expensive player return comfortably in time for PSG’s Champions League last-16 first leg against Barcelona on February 16.

Most feedlot operators at one time or another have wondered if cleaning their feedlot during the winter makes a difference in the performance of the cattle in the feedlot. In an attempt to answer that question, Bryan Neville, animal scientist at the Carrington Research Extension Center (N.D.), and graduate student, Rebecca Moore, performed a study that was designed to illustrate the impact of feedlot cleaning on finishing steers in the feedlot.
 This study was conducted during the 2018-19 winter and involved the calves that were enrolled in the Dakota Feeder Calf Show project.
 “Calves, such as those in the Dakota Feeder Calf Show, serve several purposes,” Neville explained. “We are able to offer the owner of those calves information in terms of animal gain and carcass quality, and for us, as a research center, we have animals that allow us to accomplish different research objectives, which in this case was looking at what impact cleaning pens during the feeding period during the winter had on animal performance, and at the end of the day, carcass quality.”
