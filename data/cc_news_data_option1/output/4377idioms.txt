Trump is pro-America and pro-American. His actions have given Americans more disposable income. Under his administration, unemployment for virtually every demographic reached new lows — again giving Americans across the board more disposable income. His attitudes have brought the stock market to new highs, which I’m certain will be reversed quickly if he is not re-elected. Many discount those gains by citing reversals created by the pandemic. They should be reminded that the pandemic came from China and not from Trump, and the numbers are once again on the rise.
 There are many more reasons to support Donald Trump — too many to be cited here, but perhaps the questioning letter writer will get a peek at the truths others can see.
 More recently, another letter writer sought to enlighten readers regarding the “accomplishments” of Joe Biden as he makes his third try for the presidency in 32 years — his first failure was in 1988. The writer cited Biden’s 1969 law degree. She didn’t mention poor performance in law school. She ignored his class rank. Biden was No. 76 in a class of 85. Come on, man. Even Bill Clinton was a Rhodes scholar with a scholarship to Oxford. Worse? Biden has a recorded history of lying repeatedly about alleged but proven to be nonexistent academic achievements.
 The third, and largest, paragraph cited more “accomplishments.” The paragraph was filled with various positions and titles Biden has held and stands he took on various issues. I found no “accomplishments” in the entire listing. She ended that paragraph citing three pieces of legislation “the Obama administration passed” but makes no mention of any Biden contribution.
 More significant is Biden’s general record on legislation.

Over the last several weeks I have watched as the debate over State Question 805 has heated up. I wanted to take a moment and offer my perspective on this important question. One of the first things you should know is that what you read on your ballot is just a summary of pages and pages of changes to our state Constitution.
 When reading the actual language of the constitutional amendment, it becomes very clear that SQ 805 should be called the “career criminal relief act of 2020.” Career criminals should face consequences for their actions. Anyone who repeatedly commits crimes should face longer and stronger sentences based upon their continuing criminal endeavors. No one should benefit from a life of crime.
 State Question 805 bans the practice of being harsher on repeat offenders of crime based upon the number of prior convictions they have. SQ 805 purports to be only about “non-violent offenses,” but that term is confusing. SQ 805 uses a very specific part of state law to put a definition of “violent felonies” into our Constitution using a very narrow list of 52 crimes as listed on January 1, 2020, in on particular state statute. SQ 805 says all other felonies are forever deemed “non-violent” even though they might be very serious. Just a few of the crimes considered “non-violent” by this state question include:
 · All domestic violence crimes, even on a pregnant woman, in the presence of a child, with a deadly weapon or even by strangulation.
 · Burglary second degree (Home burglary)
 · Animal cruelty
 · Trafficking in controlled dangerous substances
 · Indecent exposure
 · Violation of protective orders
 · Hate crimes
 · Soliciting sex from a minor using a computer (online predators)
 · Driving under the influence
 · Identity theft
 · Arson in the second, third and fourth degrees
 · Cattle stealing
 · Vulnerable adult and elder abuse, unless they occur in a nursing facility
 Without the ability to use sentence enhancements, prosecutors would be limited to the range of punishment for a first-time offender for all non-violent crimes. Current sentence ranges are inadequate to address repeat offenders. Additionally, simply because an offender is sentenced to 10 years in prison does not mean that they will actually serve that amount of time. As a general rule, an offender will serve 25 percent of his or her time. If an offender’s sentence is five years or less on this category of felonies, they are eligible for earlier release on an ankle monitor after serving just 90 days. Because of this lack of transparency in sentences, prosecutors, juries, and judges are forced to do the math and make recommendations for longer time periods knowing that in real time it equates to a fraction of the sentence length.
 While the list I give above is not exhaustive, it is troubling. These are not minor victimless crimes, but serious offenses that have victims. Crimes like domestic abuse will no longer have graduated penalties for repeat offenders. Many of the domestic violence crimes have penalty ranges of five years or less. That about that! State Question 805 is a huge step backwards for crime victims!
 I will be among the first to acknowledge that Oklahoma needs sentencing reform. However, this reform is dangerous and should be rejected by the people in our great State!

Sometimes changing your position just a little makes it much easier to achieve a drag-free, acceptable-to-a-fish drift with a dry fly. A good example is when you’re working up a nice current seam where there is slow water along the bank and a strong current just a few feet out from the bank. If you stand on the bank and angle your cast up and out, the fly will land in the right spot on the edge of the current seam, but much of your fly line will lie on the slow water. As the fly drifts down the seam a right-angle bend will form in your line and/or leader. Once that happens you either have too much slack to set the hook if a fish takes, or the fly stops drifting naturally, resulting in a draggy drift that’s laughable to the fish. The solution is often to simply take a couple of steps out into the water (assuming, of course, that it’s safe to do so), and cast directly upstream so the fly line lands on water that’s moving the same speed as the water the fly is in.

Gov. Charlie Baker and his top education advisors urged schools Tuesday not to overreact to the rise in COVID-19 cases this fall, telling even those districts in communities deemed to be at the highest risk for transmission of the virus to stick with in-person learning unless there is evidence of spread within the school system.
 Education Secretary Jim Peyser and Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Jeff Riley also defended plans for the state to administer the MCAS exam in the spring, describing the test as being linked to federal funding and necessary to measure how far students may have fallen behind.
 The recommendations from Baker and his senior education team came after three straight days of the state reporting more than 1,000 new cases of COVID-19, a mark not seen since May. The administration, however, continued to assert that schools have not been linked to increased transmission.
 "We are not seeing the spread take place, the clustering take place, in the schools as was initially feared," Riley said. Last week, education officials reported 202 cases of COVID-19 detected in schools.
 Boston last week switched to full remote learning, and after three weeks in the high-risk category Abington Public Schools said Monday it would shift to remote-only learning until at least Nov. 12. In Milton, the high school will pivot to fully-remote learning starting Tuesday after the rise in infections left it understaffed.
 Baker said he wouldn't "Monday morning quarterback" any district's decision, but suggested school might be a safer place for teenagers than at home.
 "It's a jump ball in my mind about whether having all those kids at home fraternizing with their friends, not wearing a mask, not socially distancing on the off-hours, is probably every bit as risky, maybe more so based on what's going on in the parochial schools, than those kids being at schools, wearing a mask and having the rhythm and the structure that comes with spending six or seven hours a day in a formal setting where everybody's got a face covering on," Baker said.
 The governor said he understood, for instance, why Marblehead went remote for two weeks after it could not identify all the attendees of a large party. He then pointed out the decision his hometown of Swampscott made to switch to a hybrid model after being in the high-risk red category for multiple weeks.
 "If you don't have any transmission in your schools, it's probably fine to continue to have kids go to school," the governor said.
 Peyser and Riley testified before the Joint Committee on Education on Tuesday as part of a legislative oversight hearing on the state's return to school in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor's comments were made later in the day during a press conference where he backed up the message from his advisors.
 The Baker administration has asked districts to review at least three weeks of community COVID-19 data before considering changes to their learning models, but Peyser said even consistently "red" communities should not switch to remote learning unless the virus is spreading in schools.
 "It is increasingly clear that schools are not a source of transmission," Peyser said.
 Billerica School Superintendent Tim Piwowar said that in his town, where they adopted a hybrid learning model, there have been 15 cases of COVID-19 in the school community. While he said Billerica will likely soon be in the "red" category, the schools have detected no evidence of transmission and only five close contacts within the classroom setting.
 Piwowar said the biggest impediments in Billerica to bringing all students back to the classroom was physical space to accommodate six feet of distancing and transportation.
 "We simply do not have the financial wherewithal to double our transportation costs to facilitate a full in-person return," Piwowar said.
 Riley said DESE was reviewing whether it could safely loosen the guidelines for school transportation and distancing on buses, particularly for rural school districts where students must travel longer distances to get to schools.
 "That is still in development and no decision has been made on that and it has to be blessed by medical professionals," Riley said.
 Sen. Jason Lewis, the co-chair of the committee, acknowledged competing desires among educators, advocates and parents for the state to either provide clearer guidance on how schools should act, or to leave those decisions more fully to local communities.
 "There are no easy answers," Lewis said. "What I'm sure we can all agree upon is we must do everything we can to support the academic and social-emotional needs of all our students."
 Piwowar said that while he could support an MCAS exam this spring to be used as a diagnostic tool, he said it should be "loudly, clearly and repeatedly" stated that the test will not be used to hold teachers accountable or to compare districts.
 Massachusetts Association of School Committees Executive Director Glenn Koocher also said he was leery of how the test data might be used. And while he credited Riley with trying to heal the relationship between DESE and local school officials, he said a "detente" is probably the best that could be achieved.
 "To those who will threaten districts, I would simply say, when you threaten us, you demonize yourself," Koocher said, taking issue with DESE's plans to audit districts that remain remote despite low virus activity.
 Peyser said the MCAS would be important this school year for the state to understand how much learning students lost by being home for many months, or trying to learn remotely. While he predicted an increase in pressure to suspend the exam for another year, he called that a "stalking horse" for ending standardized testing completely.
 Riley said the department also has no reason to believe that the federal government will relax testing requirements in 2021, which is linked to substantial amounts of federal education aid.
 "We do need, at a bare minimum, diagnostic statewide data and I think parents want to know if their kids have lost ground and how much," Riley said.
 The hearing took place at the same time Baker and Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders were warning that celebrations of Thanksgiving with extended family this year would be extremely risky.
 Sen. Julian Cyr, of Truro, asked, through the chairman of the committee, whether districts or the state should consider a mandatory week of remote learning after the holiday to mitigate the threat of students bringing COVID-19 into the schools from holiday travel or festivities.
 Peyser responded that the state was focused on maximizing safe time in the classroom, and Riley said that although it had been discussed, it was not the department's recommendation.
 "We think, at this time, that is not the way to go," Riley said.
 The emphasis on making sure as many students are able to return to the classroom as possible comes as the Trump administration is preparing to send more than 2 million rapid COVID-19 antigen tests to Massachusetts that will be deployed to an initial group of schools in early November.
 Riley said the pilot program using Abbott BinaxNOW tests, which can diagnose coronavirus infection in as little as 15 minutes, will be a critical new tool for schools to identify infection in symptomatic students and staff and contain the virus before it starts spreading.
 Riley hinted that in the coming weeks the administration also would have a major announcement to make on internet connectivity and hotspots for students.
 Hadley School Superintendent Anne McKenzie said internet connectivity continues to be an issue in western Massachusetts, where even some principals didn't have home internet at the start of the pandemic.
 "This issue of connectivity in western Massachusetts cannot be overstated," McKenzie said.
 Thomas Scott, the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, said one of his biggest concerns was burnout of administrators and teachers, which was repeated by a number of administrators about the pressure and long hours teachers are dealing with.
 "We're still learning as we go but it's clear to us we have to be cognizant of the demands we're making on people right now," Scott said.

No game equals more prep time
 As many expected, MacArthur’s game against Capitol Hill this week was canceled, leaving an all-important contest with Ardmore as the final game on the Highlanders’ schedule.
 While that means less game reps for players, it also means what amounts to a bye week for his team and more practice to game plan for the Tigers. It’s just another odd wrinkle provided by 2020.
 “There’s a positive and negative to everything this year,” MacArthur head coach Brett Manning said. “The negative is we don’t get a game. The positive is we get an extra week to prepare for Ardmore.”
 The extra week also provides some time to recover from the wear and tear that comes with a football season. And while MacArthur doesn’t have any major injuries this year, it’s still beneficial to have some extra time to recoup.
 “When you get late in the season, extra time is good for that,” Manning said. “But there’s nothing major.
 Effort matters
 MacArthur’s 5 wins so far equals their average win total from the past three seasons. But keeping mind that this team is one 4th-down stop against El Reno from leading the district, the Highlanders have seemed to exceeded most outsiders’ expectations. However, they’ve met the expectations of Manning and his coaching staff, in large part due to how well they’ve practiced this year. And when it comes to practicing hard, Mac has a system for grading players.
 “One of the things we really stress is the effort we give. We even grade our effort. Every player gets a technique grade and an effort grade,” Manning said. “It’s really simple. A coach just gives a plus or minus on every play. The player either gave what a coach considers to be great effort or they didn’t.
 “It’s something that was long before I coached here. My dad (former MacArthur coach Ernie Manning) did it too.”
 Helmet stickers
 Beyond just getting graded for effort, players are also rewarded with helmet stickers, or “Highlanders”. While plenty of high school and college programs hand out helmet stickers, the MacArther version is still unique to the program.
 “We’ve got a big spreadsheet that has all the criteria for getting one,” Manning said. “There’s probably 15-20 ways of getting one.”
 Those ways include getting a high grade from game film, a big hit, a takeaway, a touchdown or even having a great week on scout team. While some may think individual accolades encourage players to be focus on themselves, Manning begs to differ.
 “I don’t think it promotes individualism, because our players get excited when their teammates get them,” Manning said. “They really encourage one another.”
