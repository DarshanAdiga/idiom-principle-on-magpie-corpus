The obvious problem with the Router PIN code mode of operation is that WiFi clients can guess, and guess and guess again, until they hit on the right code. At first it seems that 8 digits (the PIN codes are all numeric) should be enough to avoid mass guessing, but there is a HUGE design flaw that converts 100 million to 11 thousand.
 An 8 digit number should mean that there are 100 million (zero through 99,999,999) possible codes. But no.
 The last digit is a checksum, so we are down to 7.
 The 7 digits however are not validated a single number. Instead, the WiFi device first offers the router 4 digits, gets that validated, then offers the last 3 digits for validation. Four digits is 10,000 possibilities. Three digits is 1,000. Adding them up yields the 11,000 mentioned above.
 Anyone guessing would, on average, only need to make half the possible guesses before hitting pay-dirt. That gets us down to 5,500 guesses. It doesn't take computers very long to make 5,500 guesses.
 Bottom line: anyone near a router that supports WPS can hack into it in a matter of hours. We may never know if the protocol was purposely designed this way to allow spying.
 And, WPS is not just in routers. I have seen an Android v4.4 cellphone that had WPS turned on when it was used as a "Mobile Hotspot", sharing its 4G/LTE data connection via Wi-Fi. There was no way to disable this either. I have not tested Android 5, 6 or 7. Or, an iPhone either.
 Software to make the 11,000 guesses is freely available in Kali Linux. It's called Reaver.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A federal judge will not block Tennessee’s implementation of a law that requires verifying signatures of voters looking to cast ballots by mail. U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson in Nashville rejected a request for a preliminary injunction of the law, ruling late last week that the record shows the risk of ballot rejection through the verification process is exceedingly low, whether it's proper or erroneous. He also wrote that voters have other options, including voting in-person early or on Election Day. “Although the signature-verification requirement does represent some kind of obstacle between placing a vote and having it counted, the mere existence of such an obstacle does not mean that Plaintiffs are excluded from voting,” Richardson wrote. The decision comes in a lawsuit that challenges three vote-by-mail restrictions in Tennessee in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. So far, the judge has declined to block another requirement ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The law imposes criminal penalties when anyone but election officials distributes forms to request absentee ballots without people first asking for them. The judge and plaintiffs disagreed over whether the law plaintiffs cited was, in fact, the appropriate one to challenge. The judge is still considering whether to pause another law that requires first-time voters to show ID at a local election office if they want to vote by mail. On the signature verification requirement, the lawsuit sought the right for voters to fix signature issues before ballots are rejected. The challenge, filed by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Campaign Legal Center, argued the law gives “unfettered discretion to election officials to reject ballots” and “creates a substantial risk that voters will be...
