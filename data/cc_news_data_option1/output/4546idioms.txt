For almost 30 years, Jennifer brought music into the lives of thousands of elementary school students in the Red Clay Consolidated School District in Delaware. She taught music at North Star Elementary School from its opening in 2005 until her retirement in 2019. Before that, she taught at Forest Oak Elementary.      Fundamental to Jennifer's life was her profound faith in God. She was a member of the Hockessin United Methodist Church choir where she used her beautiful soprano voice to praise Him. From an early age, music was an important part of Jennifer's life. She sang in jazz bands while in college and after. She was also an accomplished pianist. Jennifer cherished her time with her family and she so enjoyed spending time with her dear friends from school, from church, from her old neighborhood in Avondale and from her new home in Galena. She was a lover of life and an inspiration to all who knew and loved her.      She is survived by her husband, Sterling H. (Skip) Ivison, son Geoffrey Browell, sisters Mary Sandberg (David) and Amy Hotler, brother Tim Chambers (Nell) and stepsons William and Andrew Ivison.      Funeral services will be private but will be recorded and can be viewed remotely on Sunday, Nov. 15 after 4:00 pm on the Galena Funeral Home Facebook page. A celebration of Jennifer's life will be held next spring at Hockessin United Methodist Church. Details will be forthcoming.      In lieu of flowers, donations in Jennifer's name can be made to Hockessin United Methodist Church, 7250 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin, DE 19707 or to the Delaware Ovarian Cancer Foundation 701 Sweetleaf Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808.      arrangements by Galena Funeral Home of Stephen L. Schaech.

Things have become harder with the coronavirus lockdowns. Both ad money and donations that have kept us afloat for a while have dropped dramatically. We thought we could weather the storm, but the so-called “surge” or “2nd-wave” that mainstream media and Democrats are pushing has put our prospects in jeopardy. In short, we are now in desperate need of financial assistance.

The race for the 2024 Republican nomination has already quietly begun behind the scenes. A wide range of candidates are testing the waters, from moderates like Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, to firebrands like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and former Trump officials like ex-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has become a particular favorite with the president’s loyal supporters on the campaign trail, meaning the Trump name could endure.

(AP) - Chanting "This isn’t over! and “Stop the steal,” supporters of President Donald Trump protested at state capitols across the country Saturday, refusing to accept defeat and echoing Trump’s unsubstantiated allegations that the Democrats won the election by fraud.From Atlanta and Tallahassee to Bismarck, Boise and Phoenix, crowds ranging in size from a few dozen to a few thousand — some of them openly carrying guns — decried the news of Joe Biden’s victory after more than three suspense-filled days of vote-counting put the Democrat over the top. Skirmishes broke out in some cities.In Atlanta, outside the state Capitol in the longtime Republican stronghold of Georgia, chants of “Lock him up!” rang out among an estimated 1,000 Trump supporters. Others chanted, “This isn’t over! This isn’t over!” and “Fake news!” The streets were awash with American flags and Trump banners.No immediate violence was reported, though at one point, police moved to separate Trump opponents from supporters. Biden held a slim lead in Georgia, which hasn’t gone for a Democrat since 1992.Jordan Kelley, a 29-year- old from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, drove three-plus hours to Atlanta to attend the pro-Trump rally.“There’s election fraud going on here,” said Kelley, claiming that voters in Georgia, a state with a GOP governor and secretary of state, had improperly counted the ballots to put Biden ahead. “Even though I live in Tennessee, I’m an American, and I want to make sure Americans have a voice in the election.”He planned to make the 10-hour trip to Washington next week to demonstrate on the steps of the Supreme Court, where Trump and his lawyers have vowed to eventually make his case.Underscoring the hard feelings on both sides of the nation’s deep political divide, anti-Trump protesters in Washington booed, yelled obscenities, shouted “Loser! Loser!” and gave the finger to Trump’s motorcade as the president returned to the White House from a golf outing Saturday.Two signs posted in front of Trump’s Washington hotel read “Don’t be a sore loser” and “Face Reality.”Contrary to the claims of Trump supporters, there has been no evidence of any serious vote fraud. And some Republican elected officials around the country began to distance themselves from Trump and urge him to accept the outcome gracefully.A couple of thousand Trump supporters gathered at the Pennsylvania Capitol in Harrisburg. Pennsylvania played a crucial role in Biden’s victory.“If we don’t stop this today, it’ll all be over,” Bruce Fields, 66, said of news organizations declaring Biden the winner. “Otherwise we can kiss freedom goodbye.”About two dozen heavily armed men, some wearing camouflage, joined the rally.At the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix, a crowd swelled to more than 1,000 within hours. Biden won Arizona on his way to victory in the Electoral College.“It’s very suspicious that President Trump, with the red wave we’ve been seeing in Arizona, is struggling,” Kelli Ward, former state senator and chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party, told boisterous pro-Trump demonstrators. “I want to know if there is any discrepancy with the numbers coming out of the machines.”Even in a place that wasn’t close, Trump supporters gathered in droves to express support for him and vent frustration over the outcome of the election. Outside North Dakota’s Capitol in Bismarck, the state’s all-Republican congressional delegation joined chanting, sign- carrying protesters.A few skirmishes broke out between Trump backers and pro- Biden and Black Lives Matters demonstrators, with one BLM supporter attempting to handcuff himself to a Trump supporter. The two men began wrestling on the ground.An officer escorted the Black Lives Matter supporter to a squad car. It was unclear if he had been arrested.In Lansing, Michigan, about 50 Trump supporters and a smaller group of marchers carrying Black Lives Matter flags converged on the state Capitol, where they pushed, shoved and shouted at one another in a tense standoff. But within moments of the race being called, a few from both sides broke into prayer, and at least one pair hugged.Frank Dobbs, 40, of Henderson, Nevada, brought a bullhorn and a Trump 2020 flag that he wrestled with in a stiff wind during a rally outside the Clark County registrar of voters office in North Las Vegas.“It’s not over until it’s over. There’s still the courts. If ever there’s ever a time to expose widespread fraud, this is the president to do it,” Dobbs said. “The media doesn’t decide who wins the presidency. The legal voters of this country decide.”___AP journalists Jocelyn Noveck in New York City and Anna Liz Nichols in Lansing, Mich., contributed to this report.

But it was Authentic's race, breaking from the outside, from start to finish. He came down swiftly, in the first few seconds of the race, on Belmont winner Tiz The Law, who broke well from the second post position and who led for the first few strides. Authentic established himself easily and well around the first turn. It was in the backstretch that his work got a little harder, in the shifting constellation of his rivals around and behind him, but he never flagged and retained his composure under a masterfully controlled ride by John Velasquez. Improbable was six lengths back at the top of the backstretch and needed to make a move up through the traffic, which he did by moving outside at the top of the stretch. He very nearly snagged Authentic, who responded by kicking out and away in the last furlong.

El 12 de diciembre de 2017 se aprobó la modificación de la ordenanza 12625, por la cual se prohíbe por completo el uso de pirotecnia en el ejido de Comodoro Rivadavia. La normativa fue aprobada de manera unánime por parte de los ediles y acompañada con aplausos de los padres de niños con autismo.
 Sin embargo, la ordenanza nunca se cumplió correctamente. No existieron las campañas de concientización y en las celebraciones de Navidad y Año Nuevo se podía observar una gran cantidad de pirotecnia.
 Ahora, a menos de cumplirse tres años de aquella modificación, el Sindicato del Fósforo y comerciantes locales elaboraron un proyecto para vender pirotecnia de bajo estruendo. Los integrantes de integrantes de Comodoro TGD Padres TEA (Trastornos del Espectro Autista) están en alerta y buscan diferentes maneras para que este eufemismo no ponga en riesgo la salud de niños y jóvenes con trastornos.
 “Este anteproyecto no se nos tiene en cuenta. Solo nos dedica dos renglones y después solamente habla del libre comercio y las leyes que rigen para la comercialización y uso de la pirotecnia. Está muy basado en lo comercial y no en la salud, como estipula la actual ordenanza”, cuestionó Silvana Casas, parte de Comodoro TGD Padres TEA.
 En diálogo con El Patagónico, Casas manifestó que los concejales están dispuestos a tratar el proyecto de ordenanza, pero se logró parar a la intención de los ediles al dejar en claro que hay que llegar a un consenso de todas las partes.
 “La ordenanza de Pirotecnia Cero dejaría de tener vigencia. Ellos dicen que se venderían productos de luces y color, pero en el proyecto no dice nada de eso. Habla de bajo estruendo o bajo impacto, pero nosotros queremos saber de qué hablan cuando dicen bajo impacto. No sabemos qué pueden llegar a probar vender bajo esa palabra. Tampoco sabemos qué efecto puede llegar a tener en media hora (por lo que se estima que se extienden los festejos de Navidad y Año Nuevo)”, criticó.
 Es por eso que desde la ONG se solicitó la intervención de las autoridades sanitarias y de la Oficina de Derechos y Garantías para que participe en este debate. “Este proyecto que llegó no nos estaría incluyendo porque no habla de nosotros”, aseveró Casas.
 _“ES UN AÑO COMPLICADO”_
 Este proyecto de pirotecnia de bajo impacto puso en alerta a los padres de niños con autismo. Es que no es un año fácil para ellos. “Los chicos no han tenido terapia durante todo el año. Esto genera que se están lastimando por el estrés, ansiedad, por no ver a su entorno o por el sacarlos de un día para el otro de sus rutinas. Estamos en una situación complicada. Llegar a fin de año para las familias es agotador”, describió Casas.
 La integrante de Comodoro TGD Padres TEA asegura que la venta de pirotecnia sigue existiendo y que de ninguna manera la aprobación de este proyecto permitirá bajar ese nivel de ilegalidad si no se aplican los controles que corresponden.
 “El año pasado hubo pirotecnia y nadie nos asegura que si se abre esa puerta se pueda controlar. Yo veo que en internet ya se vende y si yo quiero, me lo traen en la puerta de la casa. Vamos a cumplir tres años de la sanción de la ordenanza y han fallado muchas cosas. Falta de control, concientización en las campañas que estaban dentro de las ordenanzas y que nunca se hicieron. No sé si Comodoro está preparado para esta apertura”, consideró.
 “Si esto no garantiza la salud, nosotros no vamos a aceptar que se apruebe. Esperamos que no vuelvan a contactar para seguir trabajando, pero no vamos a aceptar este tipo de proyecto”, advirtió Casas.
