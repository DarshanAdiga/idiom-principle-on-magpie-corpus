Roadblocks could have come in the way of a change of control in SsangYong Motors even as Mahindras are battling against time to revive their ailing Korean venture. Informed sources say valuation issues may have cropped up with Haah Automotive and the reason for not being able to conclude the stake sale as yet. We have not been able to agree to certain financial terms with Haah as yet , said one person in the know. However negotiations are going on and progress is being made , said the person quoted above with the deal likely to see some kind of conclusion before the year end. So with only this investor (Haah) in the fray , It is not clear how Ssangyong will manage in the interim for working capital requirements. SsangYong is in desperate need of funds to stay afloat post parent company Mahindra deciding to let go of its control. In September Haah Automotive made an “initial” offer of $258 million for a substantial stake in SsangYong Motors. After paying Rs 2,100 crore ($463 million) for the purchase of the Korean car maker a decade ago and investing over $110 million , this offer by Haah is considered way too low and could be the reason for the valuation deadlock, say sources. To an email query , Mahindra said we have no comments to offer on Ssangyong and Haah . Haah Automotive to an email query said we do not comment on rumours and speculation. Haah has also sought an extension of the loan repayments and their terms might not get acceptable to the lenders. Banks like JPMorgan, BNP Paribas, Bank of America among others have a 260 mn dollar (306 billion won) exposure . Banking sources told ET that while the initial amount will be used to seek extension of SsangYong’s debt repayment the lenders have made it clear that the incoming investor in the company will have to clear the dues upfront if Mahindra cedes control. Mahindra currently owns 74.65 percent of cash trapped Ssangyong. Samsung Securities and its global partner Rothschild have been brought on board to help find a suitor for SsangYong. HAAH may not have enough money to become a major shareholder of SsangYong with only 23 billion won in annual sales, with SsangYong needing 500 billion won to normalize its operations. HAAH Automotive Holdings , purchases various vehicle assemblies from Chery which, along with parts sourced in North America are assembled in an American factory where the final vehicles are produced. These products are sold under the brand name VANTAS in North America. Informed sources say the aim is to close the deal as soon as possible so that vehicle exports to North America can start , allowing SsangYong Motor to make an inroad into the U.S. market. Mahindra’s board moved a special resolution at its AGM to reduce its shareholding in SsangYong to less than 50%, an indication of a new investor coming in rather than a complete sell out. The board last April rejected a Rs 3300 crore turnaround plan for SsangYong, pushing the Korean car maker into deep financial distress.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau became the first major world leader to speak to the US President-elect over phone, discussing the Covid-19 pandemic, China, and climate crisis. While several global leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi have congratulated Biden, Trudeau was the first to call him to convey his wishes for the success of the incoming Biden Administration.A readout from the Canadian PMO said that Trudeau "spoke with the President-elect of the United States of America, Joe Biden, to congratulate him, as well as Vice-President-elect, Kamala Harris, on their election win."China was among the major topics raised during the dialogue as the leaders discussed the "cases of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who have been arbitrarily detained in China." The two Canadians were arrested by China in what Trudeau has described as "hostage diplomacy", following the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunication firm Huawei in late 2018 in Vancouver in a case related to defrauding a bank to elude sanctions on Iran.The leaders of the neighbouring nations also "agreed on the importance of the unique Canada-US partnership". The coronavirus crisis was an important issue as they "committed to work together to fight the global Covid-19 pandemic and to support a sustainable economic recovery in both countries and the hemisphere."They also "looked forward" to engaging with regard to NATO and the G7 while "cooperating on the fight against climate change, on migration, and on global security."The Canadian government and the administration of President Donald Trump have often been at loggerheads particularly over tariffs imposed on products bound for the US. A positive note was struck in this regard, as the statement said Biden and Trudeau "looked forward to further strengthening the Canada-US relationship and to engaging on key issues, including trade, softwood lumber, Buy America, and energy cooperation such as Keystone XL (pipeline)." They also focused on the importance of "addressing anti-Black racism."

KINGSTON- The commuter train traveling by the high school was a nice metaphor for what was happening on Anthony F. Sirrico Field Monday night. Once the Silver Lake girls soccer team got rolling there was absolutely no stopping them to their final destination of a 5-1 win over Quincy High in an opening round Patriot Cup contest.
 Laker sophomore Shea Kelleher was electric in her team's Cup debut. Despite playing limited minutes she scored four times and added an assist on the Lake's other goal by Taylor Kowilcik.
 "This is what I wanted to see. We've been having some trouble in the offensive third of the field but we did a good job tonight creating some scoring chances and converting on them. It was good to see things start to click. Hopefully, we can take that momentum moving forward in the tournament," Lakers Head Coach Scott Williams said. "Our style of soccer is being aggressive and making teams defend us and I think we've been getting better with that as the season's gone along."
 Silver Lake's got another home game coming up in the double-elimination tournament. They'll take on Marshfield Wednesday afternoon at 1 p.m. after the Rams defeated Hanover yesterday, 2-1 in their Patriot Cup opener. It was the first win of the season for the Rams (1-9-2).
 "Marshfield's a good team, especially on defense, and they'll be ready to go Wednesday. They're very well organized defensively and they can transition into offense very quickly," Williams said.
 The Lakers wasted no time warming up Monday night. Kelleher, Kendyl Peterson and Kowilcik all had great scoring chances turned aside by Quincy goaltender Anna McPhillips in the opening minutes of the game.
 But she couldn't stop everything.
 Silver Lake got on top at the 10 minute mark on a play that traveled the entire length of the field. Goaltender Emma Hudson made a save and quickly threw the ball to Kelleher. Kelleher worked her way down the field before dishing off to Peterson. Her shot was blocked but Kelleher was there to collect the rebound for the opening score.
 Kelleher struck again with two minutes left in the opening period. There were two more scores coming in the opening minutes of the second quarter. Kowilcik got one right away on a rebound to make it 3-0 and then two minutes later Kelleher converted a breakaway to extend the lead to 4-0.
 Kelleher capped off her huge offensive night 2:30 in the second half with her fourth goal of the game.
 Quincy got on the scoreboard later in the quarter on a goal by Lauren Medeiros.
 Silver Lake's filled with underclassmen up front who will only improve as they play more together. That's bad news for Patriot League squads looking down the road.
 "Shea handles the pressure well" of leading the Lakers offensive attack, Williams said. "She thrives on the challenge of being the player the other team tries to stop and she can shoulder that challenge. Shea learned a lot from having Calliste (Brookshire) around last season. She demands a lot of herself and she always wants to be a little bit better and help her team however she can. You want to coach a player like that."
 Kelleher knows she can't do it all along. She's got some strong soccer players around her to share the load.
 "It's not just all on me, which is good. I've got some talented teammates around me" to help get the offense going, Kelleher said about a group of young forwards that includes Kowilcik, Peterson, and Caileigh Jensen. "Our passing and combination plays have been working well and that's helping to set up the offense."

Many Cullman residents will likely be seeing a lower sewer and water bill in 2021 after the Cullman City Council passed two ordinances to set the rates for the coming year.
 After a rate study conducted by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management and the University of North Carolina, the city found that it would be beneficial to residents to move to a tiered rate system for water and sewer, said Councilman David Moss.
 He said the new rate system means residents’ water and sewer bills will be based more on usage than they have been in the past, which should hopefully benefit some residents.
 Mayor Woody Jacobs said the city has received complaints from residents who live alone and are on a fixed income who said the city’s minimum rates were unfair to people who didn’t use very much water, so the new rate system should bring lower bills for those residents.
 “It’ll help them tremendously,” he said.
 According to the new ordinance, residents who live inside the city limits will pay a $10 minimum rate on their sewer bills each month, compared to the previous minimum rate of $39, while residents who live outside the city limits will have a new minimum rate of $20 compared to the previous minimum of $49.
 While residents will have a lower minimum rate, the usage rates have increased by $.50 per 1,000 gallons of water used.
 The new ordinance means that a resident inside the city limits will be charged $10 per month in sewer fees if they use less than 1,000 of water, and if they use more than 1,000 gallons, they will be charged an additional $13.50 per 1,000 gallons of water that they use. Residents outside the city limits will be charged a usage rate of $16.50 per 1,000 gallons used.
 The second ordinance, which changed the water rates, will follow the same tiered system.
 The new minimum fee for water rates will be $10 for residents inside the city limits and $20 for those outside the city limits, compared to the previous rates of $35 and $48, respectively.
 The rates for residential water service will also include usage fees of $9.50 per 1,000 gallons for those inside the city limits and $13 per 1,000 for those outside the city limits.
 City Clerk Wes Moore said he has compared the new sewer and water rates with the city’s previous rates, and he found that around 50 percent of the city’s residents will see lower bills due to the new tiered system.
 To make up for the lower residential rates, commercial and industrial sewer and water rates have been increased.

This is on top of the fact that many of these clubs do not include medical insurance in the contract offered to players and coaches, thereby further exposing them to all manner of dangers both on and off the pitch.
