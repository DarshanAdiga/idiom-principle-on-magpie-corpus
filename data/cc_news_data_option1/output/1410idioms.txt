The M760i powerhouse is on its way out, but don’t fret as the Bavarians are working on something that will also be able to move mountains thanks to copious amounts of torque. When BMW announced the beefiest version of the next-generation 7er will have zero emissions, it didn’t disclose any details about the power delivered by its electric motors.

After the cold and dreary months of winter, I am always eager for spring and to decorate for the Easter season. For me, celebrating Easter and the joys of spring go hand in hand.
 Once you make the decision to set a formal or informal table, then the fun can begin. We've become a disposable society where paper plates, cups and napkins are the norm for family gatherings. Consider using the opportunity to take out the fine china, crystal and flatware. If you don't own fine china, but would like to start your own collection, visit estate sales or antique malls. While you're searching for these goodies, keep your eyes open for ceramic bunnies, chicks and lambs. Vintage tablecloths, napkins and candle holders are often found for great prices.
 For a semi-formal place setting, I have often used wicker chargers. Dollar stores offer so many unique items to "fill in the gaps" on the table. Consider small vine bird's nests, tiny Easter eggs to fill small baskets at each place setting and holiday-themed salt and pepper shakers. Fresh flowers are always appropriate to herald the arrival of spring!
 For fun and informal meals, vibrant Fiestaware plates always bring compliments from my guests. If you don't want to purchase an entire set of dishes, neighborhood yard sales and estate sales are your friends. The best part of using Fiestaware (besides its bright colors) is the ease of mixing and matching. I've used pink, purple, robin's egg blue, green, orange and yellow all together for an Easter egg color-themed table.
 If room allows, have a separate "kids' table." Children love the bright colors and, again, the dollar stores are a treasure trove of goodies for setting the perfect table for your youngest guests. Vinyl tablecloths that can be easily cleaned are perfect for the inevitable spills and drips. Melamine plates are suitable for the kids, along with plastic cups or glasses. Consider filling a large basket with plastic Easter eggs as your centerpiece. If time allows before the meal, let the kids decorate their own boiled and dyed egg to use as their place setting marker.
 Don't forget about the serving pieces. Silver trays, vintage egg plates for stuffed eggs, cabbage shaped bowls for coleslaw and platters with a carrot motif all contribute to the beauty of your Easter table. Plan ahead and visit your local hobby or department stores the days after Easter. You'll find great bargains for next spring's family table.

A Joe Ralls hat-trick sealed a 4-2 victory for Cardiff in an incident-packed encounter with Birmingham.
 The visitors dominated before Kristian Pederson’s early opener but the hosts completed a first-half fightback thanks to Curtis Nelson’s first Cardiff goal and Ralls’ dubious penalty.
 Danny Ward’s dismissal opened the door for Birmingham after the Cardiff striker was sent off for a dangerous challenge on Kerim Mrabti, but Ralls completed his brace to take the hosts two goals clear.
 Ivan Sunjic’s long-range strike gave Pep Clotet’s Blues a glimmer of hope, but Ralls secured the three points when he completed his treble from the spot deep into stoppage time.
 Cardiff’s set-piece vulnerabilities were laid bare in their South Wales derby defeat to Swansea at the Liberty Stadium, and they were once again on show for all to see after only two minutes.
 Fran Villalba’s searching free-kick was met by Lukas Jutkiewicz, who powered a header across goal for the Birmingham players queuing at the back post.
 Mrabti somehow failed to get a meaningful contact on the ball from two yards out but Pederson was on hand to bundle into an empty net for an early lead.
 Birmingham could have been 3-0 up when they were dealt a harsh blow by referee Andrew Madley after 29 minutes.
 As a Ralls corner curled into the area, the referee adjudged Blues captain Harlee Dean to have tugged on Aden Flint’s shirt and pointed to the spot.
 Ralls stepped up and found the bottom right corner to draw the Bluebirds level, and they competed an unlikely turnaround 10 minutes later.
 Aden Flint powered Marlon Pack’s corner straight at Camp, who could only palm the ball back into the danger zone. Nelson failed to provide the finishing touch twice in the six-yard box melee but eventually made a solid contact to steer the ball into the net to crown his first league start with a goal.
 The momentum swung back the way of Clotet’s side seven minutes after half-time when Ward was shown a straight red card for a crunching studs up challenge on Mrabti.
 Instead of sitting in and grinding out a result, Cardiff went on the offensive and their plan paid off after 69 minutes.
 Nathaniel Mendez-Laing outmuscled Pederson down the right wing and surged into the box before squaring the ball for Ralls to sweep past Camp and into the far corner.
 Sunjic gave the travelling Blues fans a late ray of hope when he picked up the ball 25 yards out and fired a fierce effort into the top corner.
 But their hopes evaporated in stoppage time when captain Harlee Dean was the second man to be shown a straight red after elbowing Ralls in an aerial duel.
 There was still time for Omar Bogle to be tripped in the box by Marc Roberts to allow Ralls to calmly complete his hat-trick from the penalty spot.

“We’re on 14 and I said, ‘Let’s get to 15.’ You can’t be on 14 and thinking about 18,” LaCava said. “But now we can start talking about 16. So we’re getting closer.”
 It was the first time Woods won a major when trailing going into the final round. Francesco Molinari, the 54-hole leader, was still up two shots heading into the heart of Amen Corner.
 And that’s when all hell broke loose.
 Molinari’s tee shot on the par-3 12th never had a chance, hitting the bank and tumbling into Rae’s Creek for double bogey. Until then, Molinari had never trailed in a round that began early in threesomes to finish ahead of storms.
 And then it seemed as though practically everyone had a chance, until Woods delivered the key shots at the big moment, just like the old days.
 Schauffele failed to birdie the par-5 15th and scrambled for pars the rest of the way for a 68. Dustin Johnson made three straight birdies late in the round, but he got going too late and had to settle for a 68 and a return to No. 1 in the world.
 Woods goes to No. 6, his first time inside the top 10 since the 2014 PGA Championship.

LETTER: 'Choose to do the right thing' \- The Item - telegram.com - Worcester, MA


--DocBreak--
LANCASTER - Almost everything discussed at the selectmen's meeting on Monday night was about the coronavirus. In fact, in this new world of living under the COVID-19 pandemic, there were some technical difficulties with the first virtual meeting. One selectman had issues joining so it started late, the entire meeting was limited to a strict 45 minutes due to Zoom constraints, and the town administrator was told he looked like a DJ due to the lights behind him.
 It took almost no time for Selectmen Walter Sendrowski and Jay Moody to change the dates of the Annual Town Meeting and the town election. Selectman Stan Starr recused himself due to a potential conflict of interest due to running for re-election this year. Just like Bolton and Stow, the other members of the Nashoba Regional School District, the May 4 town meeting was pushed to June 22 and the election from May 11 to June 29.
 Town Administrator Orlando Pacheco was thanked by a resident for his coronavirus video updates. Pacheco warned "the numbers will go up" of Lancastrians infected by the virus.
 Town building access
 Pacheco said he believes the correct date to re-evaluate the opening of town buildings to the public is Monday, May 18. He said it "may have to extend out, but wants to be optimistic."
 Sendrowski said he preferred to be more optimistic and said they "can always change the date if things get better."
 Pacheco said people had been to the Prescott Building to pick up materials to do work from home, and regular cleanings were still happening of that building and all of the others.
 The governor has ordered schools to remain closed until at least May 4.
 Budget
 Pacheco said the budget and capital plan is at a "standstill." He said the state revenue projection is now likely to be off by $2 billion, and that it "could get worse" if the shutdown affecting all aspects of daily life due to the coronavirus continues. Starr did some quick mental math and said the state had currently lost 7 percent of its budget.
 This "will have spillover" to municipal payments and Chapter 70 and 90 state aid for the towns and the schools, Pacheco explained. "We need to start preparing scenarios for budget and prioritizing capital expenses."
 However, legislation recently passed by the state does give the town powers they don't normally have to allow an extension for tax payments and to waive penalties and interest.
 Pacheco said the town's ability to offer this through June 30 "adds flexibility and helps taxpayers."
 Schools
 Joseph Gleason, a Lancaster resident who sits on the Nashoba School Committee, told selectmen that their counterparts in Bolton voted to not approve the warrant article for a feasibility study for a new high school. He said Bolton wanted a maximum cost of $1.5 million instead of $2 million.
 Gleason said he was "looking for their support," hoping to know the selectmen's thoughts prior to the School Committee meeting next Wednesday becaus,e with two towns Board of Selectmen opposed to the article, they would have to adjust it, including possibly amending it on the floor of all the town meetings.
 However, with the deadline for the Town Meeting warrant now in early June, selectmen have time to make a decision and agreed to give their answer by mid- May.
 Gleason and Kathy Codianne, chairman of the School Committee, told selectmen they were happy with that.
 A new School Committee member was also unanimously appointed by selectmen and the School Committee members. Brett Collins, a long-time Lancastrian and former call firefighter with two children in fifth grade, will fill the remainder of the term for the third seat on the committee and will be on the ballot for the next town election.
 In other business
 • Atlantic Union College has passed papers on seven or eight peripheral properties on their campus, out of about 20 buildings plus the main campus that the AUC is trying to sell as one property, Pacheco said. Having been bought by private third parties, the buildings sold are now taxable.
 • The final Route 70/117 intersection design has been submitted to MassDOT.
 • There are $70,000 of solar farm revenues this quarter. According to Pacheco, that is above projected. Credits are also being accumulated without much electricity use due to the shutdown, so more surplus credits are coming, and can be sold on the open market.

Dan Schwan can’t hit the road just now, not with all that’s going on in the world.
 So on Wednesday afternoon the long-ago Santa Rosa grocer and now nearly full- time resident of Minnesota pulled his accordion from its case and he hit the street.
 “We need to break the boredom,” the 87-year-old Schwan declared amid his sidewalk performance a couple of blocks off Yulupa Avenue. Though he lives outside of Minneapolis, he keeps his former home near Matanzas School.
 Neighbors of all ages practiced social distancing just before supper time Wednesday as they stood or sat, maybe sipped or nibbled something, and took in Schwan’s one-man show.
 “The Tennessee Waltz” flowed dreamily from his amplified accordion, and “Old Rugged Cross,” “You Are My Sunshine” — one standard after another.
 “I used to know about 200 off the top of my head,” shared Schwan, who carries musical DNA from the late, German-Russian TV bandleader and accordionist Lawrence Welk.
 …
 LIKE WELK, Schwan was born and grew up in North Dakota. Unlike Welk, whose mother was a Schwan, the star of the sidewalk performance on Sacramento Avenue never studied music.
 “I’m strictly by ear,” he said after the concert that brightened lives amid the humdrum of shelter-in-place. “I can’t read a note.”
 But, clearly, he can play.
 Fact is, said listener Joan Peterich, who’s lived in the Bennett Valley neighborhood for 50 years, “There’s nothing Dan can’t do.”
 Peterich, wife of widely admired former Montgomery High School coach and teacher Russ Peterich, mentioned the unique and clever face mask that Schwan, grandfather of Montgomery boys’ soccer coach John Schwan, made from an old Oakland A’s cap.
 Wednesday afternoon’s concert, Joan Peterich said, “was good for the whole neighborhood.”
 When she and her husband first met Schwan and his first wife, Betty Lou, the Schwans owned an operated one of the small neighborhood grocery stores that used to be common in Santa Rosa and elsewhere. Their J&S; Market was on Wilson Street at 9th; now it’s the 9th Street Market & Deli.
 …
 IT WAS 1960 when the Schwans, who’d married in North Dakota and were still in their 20s, came to Santa Rosa to buy the former Feist’s Market from Dan’s uncle, Charlie Feist.
 They named their store J&S;, for Jager and Schwan. Pete Jager was Dan Schwan’s brother-in-law and for a while was his business partner and the store’s butcher.
 Dan and Betty Lou Schwan brought into the world four children and all helped to run what was then not a convenience mart but a small grocery store.
 The family moved into the house off of Yulupa and Sacramento avenues in 1962. As a busy young grocery and family man, Dan Schwan indulged in the purchase of his first significant musical instrument.
 “I always loved the accordion,” he said. “I could never afford to buy one.”
 He paid $100 for a used one he found through a PD classified ad.
 He taught himself to play and some years later spied in his hometown paper an ad for a serious, electronic accordion. He went to see it and at once was smitten.

The point, Chumley wrote, is this: "Are Americans so fearful of getting sick that it’s worth staying behind closed doors, tanking the economy, shattering business-owner dreams, shutting schools, running around with protective face gear — for the next year and a half?

All of us have a sort of inner gravity that constantly pulls us back toward normal, even when normal is not healthy. When will things be normal again? Our routines, which always have suffered interruptions, have now been turned on their heads. Everything has changed.
 The pandemic has highlighted the limits of our ability to control the future. When we are in our usual routines, we assume we know what is coming next. Now, we are painfully aware that we don’t. When normalcy finally returns, that awareness is likely to dissolve like a mist.
 However, when the awareness of our limits dissolves, the limits themselves remain. As long as our routines are in full swing and our rhythms uninterrupted, we can overlook those limits. We may even congratulate ourselves that our crystal ball readings have been spot-on. Nevertheless, human beings are not, and never have been, good at controlling the future.

_Nuova Delhi, 10 apr 09:21 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Nabarro ha ribadito quanto affermato la scorsa settimana in un’intervista al quotidiano “Hindustan Times”, esprimendo apprezzamento per il blocco delle attività produttive e dei movimenti non essenziali imposto tempestivamente in India. “Durante un lockdown, si deve costruire una capacità di comunità per interrompere la trasmissione laddove ha origine, nelle comunità locali, e io vedo che in India ciò viene riconosciuto”, ha spiegato il dirigente. “Il blocco in India è stato piuttosto precoce, quando era stato rilevato un numero relativamente piccolo di casi. Questa è stata davvero una decisione lungimirante perché ha dato a tutto il paese l’opportunità di confrontarsi con la realtà di questo nemico. La gente ha capito che c’è un virus in mezzo a noi. Ciò ha dato il tempo di sviluppare capacità a livello locale per interrompere la trasmissione e selezionare gli ospedali”, ha affermato l’esperto. (segue) (Inn)

Rangers boss Steven Gerrard was surprised by the timing of Craig Levein’s sacking by Hearts as the clubs prepare to meet in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
 The Jambos lost 1-0 at St Johnstone on Wednesday night to leave them level with Ladbrokes Premiership bottom side St Mirren on points, and the following day the Gorgie club announced that Levein had been relieved of his duties as manager.
 The former Scotland boss will not return to his previous position as director of football at Tynecastle and has stepped down from the club’s board, although he will stay on in a lesser role until the end of the season.
 Assistant manager Austin MacPhee will take charge for Sunday’s last-four tie against Rangers at Hampden Park.
 “It can be brutal at times,” said Gerrard, who is confident that goalkeeper Allan McGregor will be fit for Sunday after missing the 4-0 win at Ross County in midweek with a knock.
 “We are aware of that. It is a results business we are in.
 “A club the size of Hearts, if you are down at the bottom of the table and you have won only one in 11, I think, you are always going to be under pressure.
 “Probably surprised a little bit at the timing, on the eve of a semi-final. But I think if you look at Hearts’ form it is probably not as much a surprise.
 “I never like to see other managers lose their job so I certainly feel for Craig. But he is still around in the background so I am sure he will have an input somewhere along the line, but probably surprised a little bit at the timing.”
 The former Liverpool and England captain does not, however, believe the disruption will have any bearing on his side’s chances of reaching the final against either Celtic or Hibernian, who play in the other semi-final at Hampden Park on Saturday.
 He said: “I don’t think it will affect the game. From my point of view we have to focus on what’s going on here, the job we want to do and our preparation.
 “It is not really our business what’s going on elsewhere.
 “I am not sure things will change too much. Obviously personnel will be the same. Austin might try to do something different with the formation or the tactics or personnel, of course he will.
 “We will have to wait and see what formation and personnel they decide to pick but you always have that challenge going into any game.”
 Gerrard believes McGregor has a “good chance” of being fit for Sunday.
 “He is improving. He will do a light session today and we will see how he reacts to that, but there certainly has been an improvement in the last 48 hours,” said the Rangers boss.
 “He is better than 50-50 at the moment so we hope in the coming days that he continues to improve, but he has a good chance.”

With most people cooped up at home bingeing Netflix, taking Zoom meetings or helping their kids with online classwork, home energy use in Sonoma County is spiking.
 According to Sonoma Clean Power, which serves almost 90% of eligible customers in Sonoma and Mendocino counties, residential electricity use jumped 15% in the weeks after local governments ordered that most residents stay home to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
 But while consumer demand for electricity has increased, total usage in the area actually fell around 9%.
 “Electric use in our territory has dropped, and the reason is there are a lot of businesses that are just not open,” said Geof Syphers, CEO of the nonprofit agency.
 Total water usage in Sonoma County, meanwhile, has remained steady compared to the same time last year, according to data from Sonoma Water, the county’s water agency. It’s too early to know the exact reason, but it’s possible that an increase in home water use is offsetting a dip in demand from businesses, said Jennifer Burke, director of Santa Rosa Water, the city’s water agency.
 “It doesn’t appear that we’ve had much change. That could reflect a shift in how the water is being used,” she said.
 While it’s unclear how residents’ water bills will be impacted going forward, those stuck at home can expect their electric and gas payments to increase by 15% to 30% over the next few months, according to Edward Randolph, deputy executive director for the California Public Utility Commission, which oversees PG&E; and other utility companies.
 In addition to a spike in home electricity use, Randolph said, residential demand for natural gas surged 55% for all of California during the two weeks following the statewide shelter-in-place order. But as the weather warms, that increase is expected to flatten out, he added.
 To help offset rising energy costs, the CPUC is expected to move up one of its planned rate discounts to this spring. The change could ultimately save consumers up to $120 at a time when many are struggling to cover their basic expenses.
 “This is the most direct way to help customers now without creating longer- term problems with rate structures down the road,” Randolph said.
 Each year, the commission issues two credits — worth between $20 and $60 this year — using revenue from the state’s cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon emissions. The first credit is already set to apply to ratepayers’ upcoming April bill. Under the commission’s plan, the second credit, originally scheduled for this fall, would be split over two bills in May and June.
 The credits will be applied automatically to all customers’ bills whether they get electricity from Sonoma Clean Power or directly from PG&E.; (Sonoma Clean Power buys electricity to sell to local consumers and transmits it over PG&E;’s electric grid.)
 The CPUC is also encouraging those who have recently lost work to contact their utility company to see if they’re eligible for the state’s CARE Rate Discount Program, which provides a 20% to 35% discount on utility bills.
 In addition, the commission last month ordered public utilities to halt all power shut-offs for nonpayment.
 The relief comes as PG&E; is asking the CPUC to fast-track approval of nearly $900 million in rate increases for wildfire mitigation. If approved, the increases would raise rates by an average of $5.70 a month starting in August and continue through 2021. However, the money could be refunded if found not to be necessary by the commission.

Rangers forecast they will need another £10million in investment before the end of the season after announcing an annual loss of £11.3million.
 The annual report of the Rangers International Football Club plc showed increased turnover of 63 per cent to a total of £53.2million, but operating expenses also rose by about £20million to £58.2million.
 The Ladbrokes Premiership side declared share issues totalling £18.2million, the vast majority of which went into converting investor loans into new shares, while a further £17.2million has been converted since the end of the financial year on June 30.
 The main increases in income came in gate receipts, which went up £9million to £32milion as a result of their vastly improved European performance; commercial and retail activities were up from a six-figure sum to £4million; and UEFA prize money rose from about £650,000 to nearly £6.4million.
 The club valued their run to the Europa League group stage, which they have emulated this season, at £14.3million.
 The biggest increase in spending was in staff costs, which went up more than £10million to £34.5million.
 The loss for the year was down from £14.3million in the previous campaign but Rangers need fresh funding to see them through the season.
 The annual report stated: “Building a team to challenge for the Ladbrokes SPFL Premiership and compete in European competition requires continued investment before success in these areas will generate a significant contribution to the revenues and cash flows of the club.
 “Until such time, the group continues to require funding support from its investors.
 “The board have received undertakings from the investors confirming that they will provide financial support as it is required.
 “At the time of preparation, the forecast identified that the group would require £10m by way of debt or equity funding by the end of season 2019/2020 in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The first tranche of funding is required from investors in November 2019.
 “However, the final amount required is dependent on future football performance, European football participation and player trading amongst other factors.”
 The declaration added that Laird Investments – a family trust belonging to Rangers chairman Dave King – had agreed to provide additional loan facilities if there were any shortfalls to the above requirements, along with a £5million loan facility until October 2021.

This crisis may end up acting as a programmatic accelerant of sorts. Automotive is one of the last categories to adopt programmatic wholeheartedly. The category still executes an outsized volume of more traditional deals. Momentum is hard to stop, and traditional has had it for some time. But the world is stopped, and with it that momentum. When things come back, it may end up being the perfect time to change the preferred buying model for the category. Watch this space, and look out for others that may have a similar outcome.

It is hard to imagine a more appropriate moment for the IMF to change its ways – indeed, it is now or never. When the Fund was created in 1945, its explicit purpose was “to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.” For decades, the IMF’s record on all of these fronts has been dismal. Now that the world economy is on the brink of collapse, it has a chance to atone for its past sins and finally justify its existence.

The future must have seemed brighter to my mother. It certainly seemed more orderly. We got into a routine of sorts. The uncertainty of the past was gradually replaced by confidence in the future.
 It was short-lived. Even at that time, unperceived by my parents, a white blood cell in my brother Kevin’s body was damaged and began growing and dividing uncontrollably. He had leukemia.
 I don’t know how long this went on before my parents noticed something was amiss. For a while, life continued normally. Kevin seemed to have everything going for him. He was a gifted athlete, popular at school, and was loved by kids and adults alike. Then the sky came crashing in.
 There was no warning that life was about to change. But that’s the way it is. The future only occasionally issues warnings. Usually, it is stubbornly silent. Our confidence concerning the future is built on shaky ground. Even now, some reader’s (or the writer’s) cells may be dividing uncontrollably, and there is no indication of what is coming.
 If COVID-19 helps us come to terms with this fundamental uncertainty, we will have wrestled some good out of a bad situation. If we are able to replace wispy confidence in the future by secure confidence in God, we will stand on firmer ground. Oswald Chambers confessed, “Faith doesn’t always know where it is being led,” then added, “... but it does love and knows the one that’s leading.”
 It is ironic. When our routines are in place and we think we have everything in hand, our confidence in the future is set to betray us. But when our routines have been upended and we’re not sure what’s coming next, our confidence in God can enable us to face the future with courage and peace.

Among my early memories of solitude are afternoons spent as a teenager in my family home in Aligarh. In the high-ceiling rooms, while the grown-ups were lost to their siestas, I would open the wooden windows that had been shut against the blazing heat just a crack and follow words on yellowing pages with this sliver of light. I made my way through stacks of books in this way, including the historical romances of Georgette Heyer. Often set in Regency-era London, these novels revolved around the lives of the wealthy upper classes – society’s _ton_.
 It was a world of leisure, populated by broad-shouldered gentlemen who spoke in lazy drawls and ladies who dreamed of love over a marriage of convenience. It was also a place so sharply defined by rigid rules governing manners and propriety, that even as it offered a seductive escape from my sheltered small- town life, it felt oddly easy to relate to.
 Heyer’s novels have similar plots and are written with a light touch, which means that they are often dismissed as trivial novels or guilty pleasures. But much like the works of PG Wodehouse, the other masterful writer I encountered in the bookstacks, I was drawn to the sheer fun of reading about the world she conjured up. Her heroines were feisty, her dialogue witty, and none of the dilemmas too dire. The characters move through settings rich with meticulously researched historical details, from the variety of snuff to the layout of a garden, to the scandals rocking polite society.
 But unlike Wodehouse, Heyer was not read by any of the men I knew. Her books, with their fading illustrated covers, were the shared inheritance of the women in my family – from my aunts, who had originally bought the volumes I pored over, to my older cousins, who led me to their favourite titles, like _Cotillion_ , _Friday’s Child_ and _The Masqueraders_.
 Which meant that we were a group of adolescents in pre-liberalisation India intensely familiar with the rituals of fashionable nineteenth- century London. We knew, for instance, that debutantes wore muslins to balls. We could tell a Dandy from a Corinthian (both men of fashion), understood the rules of duelling and knew the modish time to go riding in Hyde Park. All this, while hardly leaving our home, let alone the city.
 Over the years, I revisited these romances as reliable comfort reads, revelling in their familiarity even as their flaws became more apparent. I have found myself thinking of them during this lockdown as a way of thinking about solitude. Perhaps because it was in their company that I learned to enjoy being on my own. They are reminders of the keen happiness I felt in having unread books and empty hours at my disposal. Of the realisation that books are excellent companions as well as reliable vehicles for escape. And that solitude, so often shunned, could also be something pleasurable, to be sought out rather than avoided.

As a nurse for more than 35 years, I am asking for your assistance. The medical professionals I work alongside are putting in extra hours with little free time due to Covid-19. But that is our job and we show up every day to take care of our neighbors and our community, no complaints. Yes, we worry about bringing the virus home to our loved ones or possibly becoming ill ourselves. But we do it. Because it's the right thing to do.
 On a recent day off, I went to the Wachusett Reservoir to get some fresh air and relax. What I saw there made me anything but relaxed. People were walking with friends without six feet between them. I saw a couple with young children meeting up with an elderly couple for a picnic. After my walk, I went to the grocery store. I've limited these trips to bi-weekly to limit exposure. I became more concerned when I saw people too close to others and without masks on, putting themselves and others at risk. These are people I know and care about. People with children and elderly parents.
 I know when you're home, everything seems normal. It gets monotonous. You miss socializing with friends. But you watch the news. You've seen the devastation in other countries and other states. It doesn't have to happen here.
 If you don't have to leave your home, don't. If you absolutely have to leave your home, please practice social distancing. Keep a six foot radius around you at all times.
 Limit your trips to the grocery store and please wear a mask. Wash your hands often.
