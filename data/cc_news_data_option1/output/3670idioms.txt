BREWERS’ MOVES
 The Brewers claimed outfielder Billy McKinney off waivers from Toronto and assigned him to their alternate training site in Appleton, Wisconsin. They also designated infielder Ronny Rodriguez and right-hander Trey Supak for assignment.
 “It’s possible he seems time this year,” Brewers general manager David Stearns said of McKinney. “It’s also a nod to future years, someone we think has the potential to impact our team down the road in future years. He has major league experience.”
 Supak had posted an 11-4 record and 2.20 ERA in Double-A Biloxi and a 1-2 record with a 9.30 ERA for Triple-A San Antonio last season.

According to the FCC, rural tribal communities are twice as likely as non- tribal rural communities to have access to a terrestrial broadband network. That lack of connectivity has become a pinch point during the pandemic, as health care, education, commerce and more elements of daily life and culture made the digital switch out of necessity to curb the person-to-person spread of COVID-19.

“So there’s all kinds of things that we can point the finger at. I can do a better job with a couple of play calls throughout the game, and those are all things that we take away from this first game and we are probably sitting here asking different questions.”
 WHAT’S WORKING
 Rookie first-round pick Jalen Reagor showed off his speed, blowing past the defense for a 55-yard catch on third-and-22. Reagor also flew past defenders for what would’ve been a 75-yard touchdown catch but Wentz overthrew him.
 WHAT NEEDS HELP
 The offensive line, missing a pair of three-time Pro Bowl picks in right guard Brandon Brooks and right tackle Lane Johnson, surrendered eight sacks and couldn’t open any holes for the run game.
 STOCK UP
 Defensive end Josh Sweat had a career-high 49 snaps and recorded one sack. Sweat will push 2017 first-round pick Derek Barnett, who was out with an injury, for playing time. Injuries along the line should give Sweat more opportunity.
 STOCK DOWN
 The entire offensive line: left tackle Jason Peters, left guard Isaac Seumalo, center Jason Kelce, right guard Nate Herbig and right tackle Jack Driscoll. Herbig and Driscoll started their first career games. After Driscoll was injured, Jordan Mailata made his NFL debut in his place.
 INJURED
 Defensive end Brandon Graham is in concussion protocol. Curry and cornerback Craig James both suffered “significant” injuries and are out for multiple weeks. Curry has a hamstring issue but James’ injury wasn’t disclosed.

If you put all your  _Love Island _eggs into the Johnny Middlebrooks and Cely Vazquez basket, you may be regretting it now. Once viewed as the most solid "power couple" there could ever be on a dating competition show, the couple ran into a big hurdle in the form of Mercades Schell, who was introduced as part of the franchise's signature Casa Amor twist. She immediately set her sights on Johnny, and the two got hot and heavy -- in challenges, out of challenges and even in bed.
 Though Johnny ultimately chose to return to the villa to reunite with Cely (the explosive aftermath played out on Sunday's episode), Mercades -- who was eliminated because she wasn't chosen by an islander -- told ET's Ash Crossan after the latest episode that she believes Johnny isn't all that he seems to be. The 26-year-old New Mexico native intimated that it was Johnny who pursued her when she entered Casa Amor.

Anyone else out there remember that when we didn't find weapons of mass destruction in a stable but problematic country that wasn't involved in 9/11 we shifted our excuse for invasion to “100,000 deaths of their own citizens!?” Seventeen years and estimates of more than 600,000 Iraqi deaths from our war later we're still there.
 Saddam Hussein's attack on the Kurds was horrific. It is well documented that his actions resulted in the death of 100,000 Iraqi Kurds. Since then, Kurds have been targeted by other states, including our good friend Turkey. Despite Kurdish fighters being among our strongest allies in Iraq, American leaders now look the other way.
 By the time this is published, we'll be approaching 200,000 deaths of our own citizens from a disease “no worse than the flu.” With less than 5% of the world's population and the claim of the best medical care in the world, we somehow have over 20% of global deaths from COVID-19. Perhaps some kind nation will invade us to rid us of the incompetent and uncaring stable genius who even now shifts his gaze as Americans sicken and die.

It is past time to smash the endless reel of this Trump Horror Show. We could toss the fragments into the hundreds of fires in the West.
 One would think that this is Egypt with all the millions of trump toadies in "de nile" (I know, the original story had frogs.)
 Even with Donald Trump’s nose up in the air, he denies that the smoke he smells is only one of many glaring manifestations of climate change. The devastating fires in the West have already broken several unwelcome records with unprecedented loss and sorrow.
 Climate change deniers need to wake up to the reality of the ravaging devastation that climate change due to unchecked global warming is having on our planet. And sooner rather than later!

King County prosecutors last week charged a 66-year-old Skyway man with attempted first-degree rape, accusing the Level 3 sex offender of stalking and trying to rape a Renton woman in her apartment earlier this month.
 Garry Eastabrook was serving sentences for two extortion convictions when he escaped from the prison previously known as the Washington State Reformatory in Monroe in June 1983; he was on the lam until his arrest in October 1987. The following year, he was convicted of first-degree rape for a raping a woman at knifepoint in Thurston County, according to King County prosecutors and a spokesperson with the state Department of Corrections (DOC).
 Eastabrook spent 32 years in prison on the rape charge before he was released June 8, the DOC spokesperson said.

Bennett said he supported automated voter registration as a way of making it easier for Montanans to vote, and that he would push back on any attempts to suppress voting. Jacbosen said the only voter suppression she saw was from Bennett, “who’s pushing for all-mail ballots on reservations, trying to take away the right for people to vote in person.”
 Dennison then asked Jacobsen what evidence she had Bennett would allow people to cheat in elections. She pointed to Bennett’s support of automated online registration, which would allow fraud. Bennett countered that the current Republican administration had been “asleep at the wheel” and slow to request help from a National Guard cyber-security unit or experts from the private sector to keep hackers out of the state election system.
