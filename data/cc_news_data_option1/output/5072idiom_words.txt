It is a symbolic ritual in which everything from the dervishes&#39; movements to their clothing has meaning. The Semahane (dance hall) is a circular room designed to represent the universe, while the post on which the Sheikh, the leader of the ritual, sits is red, symbolizing the sunset and the time of day Rumi united with God. The post on which a beginner of the Mevlevi Order sits is black and only once they have completed their journey of enlightenment can they sit on a white post.

The Sema, an indispensable part of the order, is a whirling ritual that is accompanied by music and characterized by certain rules. The ritual begins with Nat-i Sherif, a song in praise of the Prophet Muhammad before the semazens make their entrance. The dervishes cross their arms across their chest and begin whirling in accompaniment to the music, taking off their waistcoats to symbolize purification and the setting aside of ego.

In Turkey, Rumi is fondly remembered by his followers as Mevlana, meaning scholar, and was buried in Konya, a Turkish city visited by millions of pilgrims every year. Upon his death in 1273, Rumi's followers founded the Mevlevi Order, also known as the Order of the Whirling Dervishes, famous for the Sufi dance known as the Sema ceremony.

In the second cycle the dervishes&#39; entire existence is said to be dissolved within the divine unity. The ceremony concludes with messages of peace by semazens and usually finishes with a recitation from the Quran.

I was genuinely very, very dejected. I was dejected that I'm not getting to make my dream film and now I have to think of a mid-sized film!" Sharma took Chopra's advice in his stride. "I told myself that it's ok and now I need to think of a new film to make. Somehow Bittu and Shruti (Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma's characters in Band Baaja Baaraat) came from somewhere in my life. When I got my characters, I worked on the story and I came up with Band Baaja Baaraat. That's how my first film as a director happened, and thankfully it went well," he recalled.
