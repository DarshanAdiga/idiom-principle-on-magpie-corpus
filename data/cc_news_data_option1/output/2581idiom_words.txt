Another Hasan Ali special came against Sri Lanka in the 3rd match of 2017 ODI series. Lankan Skipper Upul Tharanga opted to bat first after winning the toss. However, the decision proved to be a disaster as Ali continued his purple patch. After taking wickets with the new ball, Ali came back in the death overs and added some more scalps in his tally. Thanks to his five-fer, Sri Lanka were bundled out for 208 runs and lost the game by seven wickets.

Making his international debut in August 2016, Ali didn’t take long in cementing his place in the side. His variations bagged a lot of eyeballs through which he gave headaches to many batsmen. He was especially brilliant in the death overs where the batsmen aim to accumulate maximum runs. After showcasing his brilliance in white-ball cricket, Ali got a break in the Test and he didn’t fail to perform over there too. Along with his bowling prowess, Ali is also a handy batsman lower down the order who can score quick runs. As the star bowler, turns a year older, let’s revisit some of his best performances.
