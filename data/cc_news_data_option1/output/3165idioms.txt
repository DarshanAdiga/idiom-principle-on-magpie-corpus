Commission Chairperson Brenda Hanten said it was time to "not kick it down the road anymore" and was supportive of the proposal, which was initiated a few weeks ago by Commissioner Lee Gabel.


  Commissioner Troy VanDusen also supported the contract, saying it was an "insurance policy" for the county and money well spent. VanDusen wasn't certain if the county required a fulltime IT specialist.


  The commissioners will use dollars from their contingency fund to allow Connecting Point to take over IT duties from Sept. 1 through the end of the year. Starting Jan. 1, 2021 payments will be budgeted.


  The county sheriff's office already has deal in place with Connecting Point to handle its IT needs.


  The approval of a letter of contract for haul road evaluation services with Banner Associates again brought up the condition of some county roads battered by weather and large trucks, many of which have worked or are working to build energy-producing wind towers in the eastern third of the county.


  Banner Associates will be charging the county $8,000 per mile to inspect damage done to roads, bridges and culverts due to construction of the towers. The charges accumulated by Banner will then be reimbursed to the county by Dakota Range Wind Project.


  Banner expects to have preliminary report by Sept. 11 and its final report sometime in 2021. Banner provided haul road services to the county for the Crown Ridge 1 wind project which is still under way.

How to get away with murder: Jose Martinez, a serial killer and cartel hit man known as the 'Black Hand'...

NATICK - The School Committee voted unanimously Monday night to support a hybrid model for students returning to school next month.


  That means students will be on a two-week schedule, with the first spent in school, in classrooms of 12-14 students, wearing face masks and following social distancing guidelines to help prevent the potential spread of COVID-19.


  The second week will be full-remote learning at home.


  A fully-remote option was on the table for the committee, and it went with hybrid because it provides a safe level of in-person learning, given current COVID-19 data in Natick.


  Schools Superintendent Anna Nolin ticked off data points to support her recommendation to go with a hybrid approach - only three current cases of COVID in Natick, an infection rate that is .008% per 1,000 residents. And, with a low infection rate of 1-2% in surrounding communities, Nolin said hybrid made sense.


  "If this is not a low number that takes us to a hybrid model, I don't know what is," Nolin said. "If the data changes, I will be the first to lead a change (back to fully-remote)."


  For families that want fully-remote, the district will provide an educational program called Edgenuity. Teachers will not deliver direct instruction in Edgenuity, but will facilitate course work, control grading and are available to give academic support.


    Natick School Committee to vote on back-to-school plan amid pandemic  


  The committee based its decision partly on the $1.5 million the district spent on improving safety in school buildings, including systems that pump in more fresh air, frequent cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, touch-less faucets in bathrooms, and the installation of Plexiglass barriers.


  Nolin stressed she's waiting on the state to announce infection-rate guidelines that will help her team set a baseline for open and closing school buildings during a pandemic. Ultimately, the decision is made by Natick public health and school officials, she said.


  A survey is expected to go out to parents on Tuesday asking them to make a final decision on whether they want a hybrid or fully-remote experience for their children. Results will help school officials determine staffing levels to provide the remote option. The survey runs until Monday, and some parents told the committee that doesn't give them much time to make a decision.


  Nolin returns to the committee with final details for the hybrid and full- remote models.


  Negotiations also continue between Nolin and the the Natick teachers union to hammer out a few specifics, including a safe return to schools and changing working conditions.


  In the end, the committee said it made the best decision, given the current public health data and the expertise provided by Natick school and public health officials.


  "I wish we could put them all in bubble suits and protect them from the virus, and can go on," said committee member Donna McKenzie, voicing her wish that full in-person learning is always the best way to go, but impossible to deliver during a pandemic. "We have to make the best choices we can make."


  McKenzie added the community must play its part to see that the hybrid approach works. That means all residents must following public health guidelines, including social distancing and wearing face masks.

  # Efforts underway to restore Green Party to Montana ballot


  Amy Beth Hanson


  Associated Press


  HELENA (AP) — Efforts are underway in state and federal court to restore Green Party of Montana candidates to the state's general election ballot just days after a state judge disqualified them.


  District Judge James Reynolds last week granted the requests of about 500 people to have their names removed from petitions that allowed the Green Party to field candidates in the June primary election. The Green Party of Montana said it was not involved in ballot qualification, and it was later learned the Montana Republican Party paid $100,000 for the signature-gathering effort.


  Without those signatures, the Green Party did not meet ballot-qualification standards, and Reynolds ruled the Green Party candidates could not appear on the general election ballot.


  Secretary of State Corey Stapleton filed a notice of appeal with the Montana Supreme Court on Friday. His office has to file its brief by Wednesday in an expedited schedule to allow the Supreme Court to make a ruling before Aug. 20, when the general election ballots must be certified.


  On Tuesday, two Green Party candidates and two Green Party voters filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Helena asking the court to overturn Reynolds' ruling. They argue the ruling disenfranchised those who voted for Green Party candidates in the primary election.


  "The buyer's remorse suffered by some of the Green Party petition signers well after the Party qualified for the ballot — and well after many of the Green Party voters had cast ballots — did not justify the state court's cavalier disenfranchisement of Plaintiffs and nearly 800 other Green voters months after they had lawfully cast ballots in Montana's primary election," attorney Matthew Monforton wrote on behalf of candidates Royal Davis and Gary Marbut with voters Tom and Teresa Harsch.


  Reynolds' order last week was the second time in two years that he disqualified Green Party candidates from the ballot after a petition filed by the Montana Democratic Party.


  In 2018, Reynolds invalidated about 85 petition signatures challenged by the Montana Democratic Party on various grounds. Without those signatures, the Green Party of Montana did not meet the qualifying standards to be placed on the ballot.


  The Montana Supreme Court upheld Reynolds' 2018 order, despite the disenfranchisement arguments, saying voters don't have a constitutional right to vote for the candidates of political parties that did not qualify for ballot access under Montana law.

Aug. 8 -- To the Editor:


   


  New Hampshire commitment laws allows for the confinement of an individual believed to be at immediate risk to self or others as a result of mental illness. House Bill 687, commonly known as the "red flag" law, was meant to extend this protection to an implement of harm, a firearm, when imminent threat to self or others exists.


   


  It is common sense to prohibit an individual from operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, wouldn't the same logic apply to prohibit an individual from operating a firearm under the influence of suicidal or homicidal rage?


   


  All rights require some limiting guardrails to protect others from harm as a result of unreasonable or excessive exercising of that right. Just as free speech does not allow falsely yelling fire in a movie theater, wielding a firearm in the midst of a mental health crisis should also be prevented.


   


  House Bill 687 is intended to be an acute intervention to save lives from preventable suicides and domestic violence homicides, not an overreaching incursion into lawful gun ownership. Governor Sununu, please reconsider your veto.

This November Arizona voters will select 3 members to the 5 member Arizona Corporation Commission. The Arizona Constitution requires that the Commission members be elected not appointed by the Governor. The Commission has broad powers to regulate utility companies, securities, business incorporations and pipelines. Three Republicans, and three Democrats are on the ballot. If the Republicans win, the Commission will continue to be a “captive” of the large utility companies. It will continue to resist efforts to use renewable energy sources. It will favor rate hikes for small utility customers and promote “deregulation” policies favored by the companies it is supposed to regulate. The three Democratic candidates—Mundell, Stanfield and Tovar favor the use of renewable energy. Because they are not the beneficiary of large corporate donations, they will resist the efforts of the big utility companies to keep the Commission a toothless regulator. Please keep these contrasts in mind when you mark your ballots.
