Only four presidents in U.S. history have faced impeachment in the U.S. House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and Trump. But none of them were actually removed from office by the impeachment process. Nixon resigned in August 1974 before a Senate trial could come about, and Johnson, Clinton and Trump received "not guilty" votes in their Senate trials.
 Impeaching a president during a lame-duck period would be a first in U.S. history, and many of Trump's most vocal critics in the Democratic Party would say, "What's the point?"
 Sykes, however, argues, "We are clearly in dangerous waters, and no one can be sure what a president desperate to hold onto power and terrified of defeat might be capable of attempting. What actual checks remain? We can hope for institutional resistance to any attempt to impose martial law. But if we have learned anything, it is that many of the checks on presidential power are, more or less, on an honor system."
 The Never Trump journalist continues, "He has virtually unlimited pardon power; he has technical control of the DOJ; and he remains commander-in chief of the (U.S.) Armed Forces. All of this is by way of saying that _bad things can happen_."
 Sykes notes that the United States has "really only three decisive checks on a president run amok" — and they are "(1) the 25th Amendment, (2) impeachment and removal, and (3) defeat at the ballot box."
 "Trump is so far undeterred by electoral defeat — and practically speaking, the 25th Amendment is a dead letter because it relies on his own hand-picked toadies," Sykes argues. "Which leaves the alternative of impeachment, a process that is admittedly impractical. But, what if — what if Trump did try to declare martial law? Seize voting machines? Attempt to deploy the military? What stops him? Anything?"
 Trump supporters who have been urging the president to declare martial law include attorney Lin Wood and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. And Sykes warns that when talk of martial law is coming from the president's allies, it shouldn't be taken lightly.

Srinagar/Jammu/New Delhi The seven-party People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) both declared victory in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)'s District Development Council (DDC) elections on Wednesday, interpreting differently what the verdict meant in the backdrop of the Centre's controversial decision to scrap the erstwhile state's special status last year.As a high-octane war of words played out, PAGD partners said the people rejected the Union government's decision to scrap Article 370, which accorded special status to J&K, while the BJP contended that the results showed voters said no to "terrorism and separatism" and took the path of nationalism.In the eight-phase DDC elections -- the first such exercise in J&K and also the first major voting in the region since Article 370 was scrapped on August 5, 2019 -- the PAGD, a two-month-old bloc featuring regional powerhouses National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), took the pole position by winning an impressive 110 seats of the total 280 on offer across the Union Territory's 20 districts (14 seats each). The BJP grabbed 75 seats and emerged as the single-largest party on the back of its performance in the Hindu-dominated Jammu region, where it won 72 of the 140 seats.NC leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah praised the performance of the PAGD, which won 84 seats in Kashmir and 26 in Jammu, and attacked the Centre's ruling BJP. "If you really say that democracy has won, then you will have to listen to the voices of the people. And the people of Jammu and Kashmir have said it with a huge majority that they do not accept (the decisions of) August 5, 2019," he said, addressing party workers at the NC headquarters, Nawa-i-Subah, in Srinagar.At the victory celebrations, Abdullah said there might not be any assembly elections in the Union territory anytime soon. "The next elections in J&K are very far because of the defeat of the BJP in this election...If they believed in democracy, they would have sounded the bugle of the assembly elections," he said."We could have many more seats had we not contested in the alliance. But for achieving a bigger goal, small or big sacrifices have to be made… It was our duty to keep aside our differences and to come on a single platform for our identity," he added, referring to the alliance that took shape in October 2020 to demand the restoration of J&K's special status.Farooq Abdullah, his farther and another former chief minister, said NC workers proved again that "anti-Kashmir forces cannot wipe out our party", which won the most seats (67) among the seven coalition partners. "It was the BJP that made the DDC elections look like a referendum (on the Article 370 move)...now the people of J&K have made their aversion to the August 5 measures known," he said.Former chief minister and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, too, hit out at the BJP. "People have voted en masse for the alliance...Article 370 still lives in our hearts and minds and we will fight for it until our last breath," she told NDTV news channel. Mufti also said she would not contest elections until the decision to nullify of Article 370 was reversed.On August 5, 2019, the central government nullified Article 370 and bifurcated J&K into two Union Territories - J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one -- triggering widespread protests. The BJP and the Centre maintain that the decision will eventually help the region, deal a blow to terrorism and usher in development. Facing a volley of criticism, the BJP fielded a host of its top leaders to counter the PAGD's narrative. Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad rejected the contention that the results were a win for the alliance, stressing that it was the BJP that emerged as the single-largest party. "This is a victory for India, democracy, hope, development and people of Jammu and Kashmir. This is a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's larger narrative...," he told a press conference.On Twitter, Union home minister Amit Shah thanked "sisters and brothers" of J&K and said the BJP will continue to "work relentlessly towards the prosperity and development of the region" under the leadership of PM Modi."Modi government is doing everything possible to restore the grass root democracy in Jammu & Kashmir. The recently held DDC polls for the first time in the history of J&K is the testimony of the same. The mass participation in these elections reflects people's faith in democracy," he added.His colleague, Anurag Thakur, countered the PAGD's contention that people voted against the nullification of Article 370, and asserted the BJP and Independents together got over 52% votes."This shows J&K people have rejected the Gupkar Gang," he told reporters in Jammu. The people have spoken out against "terrorism and separatism" and voted in favour of democracy and nationalism, added Thakur, who was actively involved in the campaign.The BJP's vote share in the DDC elections stood at 24.5%. This number was 27.9% for Independents, who won a total of 50 seats and could play kingmakers in at least two districts. The combined vote share of the PAGD camp -- also comprising the Peoples Conference, the Communist Party of India- Marxist, the Peoples Movement, the Awami National Conference, and the Jammu and Kashmir People Democratic Front -- stood at 22.9%.In terms of strike rate, the BJP won 75 of the total 230 seats it contested (32.6%). The strike rate for the NC and the PDP, two major constituents of the PAGD, stood at 40.9% (67 seats of the 164 contested) and 39.7% (27 seats of the 68 contested).Overall, the PAGD had a clear majority in six districts (all in Kashmir) while it was close to majority in three others. The BJP had a clear majority in five districts (all in Jammu) and was close to majority in one other district. In the remaining five districts, no single party had a majority.Held under the shadow of Covid-19, the elections witnessed a turnout of 51.76% over the eight phases from November 29 to December 19.The BJP says the results showed that the party is acceptable to both the regions of the Union Territory, underscoring that three of its candidates won from the Kashmir Valley (Khanmoh-II in Srinagar district, Kakapora-II in Pulwama district and Tulail in Bandipora district), apart from the 72 wins in Jammu.

With a new strain of coronavirus causing a surge in Covid-19 infections in the UK, an important and immediate question is whether the vaccines that are being rolled out or are on the cards would work against the mutant. The new variant is up to 70 per cent more transmissible than earlier strains, prompting several countries to ban flights from the UK. Although there is no evidence yet to suggest that the vaccines will be less effective against the new strain, the concern will linger until more data on this issue is available.

Decisions to raise the earnings threshold and eligibility for some spouses of SAG-AFTRA members were not taken lightly by the 40 trustees that oversee the plan. The bulk of the plan’s funding comes from employer contributions. Producers of SAG-AFTRA-covered productions are required to pay into the plan based on a percentage of each performers’ earnings on a given project. That percentage is not deducted from the performers’ paycheck but paid out separately by the production entity. The percentage owed by the studio is also subject to an earnings cap per project (or episode) of $232,000 for feature films, $15,000 per half-hour episode of TV and $24,500 per hourlong episode. At present, the percentage that producers pay in to the fund stands at about 7.5% of performer earnings up to the cap.

Switzerland started its Covid-19 vaccine rollout on Wednesday, with a care home resident in her 90s receiving the first shot just four days after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorised.
 The woman, who lives in the Lucerne region in central Switzerland, was the first person in continental Europe immunised with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab in a vaccination campaign.
 Switzerland is battling stubbornly high coronavirus cases, recording around 5,000 fresh infections and 100 new deaths on Wednesday, in a country of 8.6 million people.
 From Tuesday, bars and restaurants began closing again across the country in a bid to rein in the outbreak, while flights to and from Britain and South Africa have been banned following the discovery of a new variant of the virus that UK officials believe spreads far more easily.
 Britain was the first country to deploy the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with 90-year-old grandmother Margaret Keenan receiving the jab on December 8.
 European Union countries are scheduled to start vaccinations on Sunday.
 Switzerland has seen more than 421,000 infections and over 6,400 deaths since the pandemic began.
 \- 'Great hope' -
 The Swissmedic regulatory authority announced on Saturday that it had approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following a two-month rolling review.
 The elderly and those with pre-existing conditions -- two million people in total -- are first in line for immunisation.
 "I am very satisfied that we have now been able to start vaccinations in the canton of Lucerne," the region's health services chief Guido Graf said in a statement.
 The neighbouring Zug canton also started vaccinating in a nursing home.
 "There is great hope that the vaccinations will combat the spread of the coronavirus effectively and bring it under control," said Zug's cantonal health director Martin Pfister.
 Among the main Swiss cities, Geneva and Basel are set to start their vaccination campaigns on Monday, while Zurich will get going on January 4.
 Geneva's hospital received its first 5,000 doses on Wednesday.
 "After a month of virtual discussions, things are becoming tangible," said Nathalie Vernaz, the cantonal pharmacist.
 In early November, Geneva had the worst per capita infection rates in Europe.
 \- Army distributing doses -
 Produced by US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech, the vaccine is based on a new technology that uses genetic material in the form of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid).
 The Swiss army is storing and distributing the vaccine doses, which must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit).
 It received an initial delivery of 107,000 doses on Tuesday, with 250,000 per month to follow from January.
 The vaccine is not mandatory but is free of charge.
 Switzerland has secured around 15.8 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, in deals with three manufacturers.
 It has signed contracts for around three million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech, around 7.5 million from Moderna, and around 5.3 million from AstraZeneca.
 With each of the three different vaccines, two doses are required per person.

I lost sight of John as he pressed into the solid mass of people on the boarding platform. All I could see were hundreds (or thousands) of people, almost all men in similar clothes who were boarding or deboarding the trains. I didn’t know whether John was still on the platform or had boarded one of the trains, and I had no way to contact him. I was suddenly alone in a mass of people and didn’t know what to do, a 40-plus-year-old adult, alone and afraid in the Beijing Railroad Station without a ticket. I wondered where I would be spending the night.
 This is the memory of being alone and afraid that comes back to me, as I think of the seniors I know who will be alone during this holiday season. This is the season, if ever, to remind them and ourselves of the real meaning of Christmas. We should all be reaching out to those we know, sharing the message of hope from that first Christmas 2000 years ago.
 Did I get to Shenyang? After what seemed like hours, John found me which I suspect was easier than me finding him, but he was not wearing a happy face. He was angry that I was going to cause us to miss our train, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to waste his time on me anymore. He grabbed my briefcase and told me in no uncertain terms, to follow closely behind him. These were the last words spoken that evening. We caught our train just in time, after which he gently pushed me down the passenger car aisle and into an unheated sleeping compartment where I would spend the night under 12 inches of quilts.
 The outside temperature on arrival in Shenyang was well below zero, but the blankets had kept me warm as I laid awake much of the night, wondering what I was doing on a train in northern China, and wishing I was home. The next day got better. John began to talk to me again, and the trip was a business success that resulted in future pleasant trips to Shenyang.
 Merry Christmas and a blessed New Year.

Stella Tennant, one of Britain’s top models, has died at the age of 50, British media reported on Wednesday.  
 Tennant was born into the Scottish aristocracy. Her unconventional, androgynous looks helped her break into the world of fashion in the 1990s.
 She went on to become the new face of Chanel and graced the covers of fashion magazines around the world.
 “It is with great sadness we announce the sudden death of Stella Tennant on 22nd December 2020,” her family said in a statement to the PA news agency.
 “Stella was a wonderful woman and an inspiration to us all. She will be greatly missed.”
 The BBC quoted a police spokesman as saying there were “no suspicious circumstances” surrounding her death, which came five days after her 50th birthday.
 Away from the catwalk, Tennant campaigned to reduce the environmental impact of the fashion industry.
 “It’s going to take us a long time to change our habits, but I think that this is so obviously a step in the right direction,” she told the Guardian newspaper last year.
 Tennant retired from the fashion industry in 1998, returning on a part-time basis to shoot clothing campaigns and appear on the runway.
 She is survived her husband, David Lasnet, and their four children.

But staging a high profile vote on the floor of the house in the short term, even if the progressives lose, should be part of a comprehensive strategy to win Medicare for All. Such a strategy would have to combine the considerable influence of congressional progressives like AOC with a movement-based approach to mobilize millions of workers to take action.

 “Like many fans, we reacted with surprise and disappointment when we heard of Ian Holloway’s resignation earlier this morning through social media,” a statement from Mr Shutes and his associates said.
 “We would like to clarify to all concerned that none of us have ever had any contact with Mr Holloway. Several weeks ago, we did make it clear through a mutual friend that we were very supportive of Ian and that if we were to take over as custodians of the club we wanted to build a legacy with him in place (which we also communicated to Philip Day in our discussions over the last week).
 “In the meantime, we have had to process the disclosure of a potential investment in the club by Alex May which surprised us, made us extremely uncomfortable and created an environment of deep uncertainty surrounding the governance of the club.

 # Finney County Museum store adds Big Pool items
 Garden City Telegram
 People with fond memories of Garden City’s Big Pool, once billed as the world’s largest free, concrete, municipal swimming pool, may want to stop by the Finney County Historical Museum as part of their holiday shopping.
 The museum’s gift shop is offering commemorative Big Pool T-shirts in two styles, as well as nostalgic 2021 calendars featuring approximately 45 photographs from the pool’s 97-year history.
 The 8.5 by 17-inch grid-style wall calendars are $15 each and the quantity is limited. The picture page for each month includes a different collection of pool images, showing swimming, diving and poolside lounging, as well as people sailing, water skiing, paddle boating and ice skating on the pool surface. There is also at least one view of elephants from Lee Richardson Zoo frolicking in the water.
 The calendars were produced with sponsorship support from the Finney County Farm Bureau Association, Heritage Realty and Garden City State Bank.
 The T-shirts include one type with a mid-20th Century image of a woman gracefully diving into the pool, underwritten by the phrase “World’s Largest Free Swimming Pool, Garden City, Kansas.” The other shirt style is fronted with the phrase “I Swam in the World’s Largest Free Swimming Pool,” and a collection on the back of Big Pool statistics and specifications.
 The shirts range in price from $20 to $26 and both styles were reproduced from designs first issued in decades past.
 Interest in the Big Pool’s history has surged recently, particularly after work began in 2020 to replace the historic swimming facility with a state-of- the-art outdoor water park to be known as Garden Rapids at the Big Pool. Conceived by Garden City Mayor H.O. Trenkle in 1921, the 72,600 square-foot pool operated from July of 1922 through the summer of 2019.
 The store is located inside the museum’s main exhibit gallery, where hours are 1-5 p.m. seven days weekly. The gift shop also carries a wide range of gifts, toys, souvenirs, collectibles, other apparel, books and videos related to Garden City, Finney County and Southwest Kansas history and culture. Gift certificates are available and the store accepts cash, local checks, major credit cards and Garden City Chamber Checks. The museum is located at 403 S. Fourth Street in Garden City’s Finnup Park, adjacent to the zoo entry arches.

The icing on the cake is the fact that VEEV has more than $1.5 billion of cash and no debt, meaning it has plenty of “dry powder” to make power moves, including acquisitions.

For his career, Jackson is the Chanticleers’ all-time career leader in sacks (26.5), yards lost from sacks (176), tackles-for-loss (44.0), yards lost from tackles-for-loss (216), and quarterback hurries (34).
 Now, Tarron leads the 11-0 and Sun Belt co-champion Chanticleers in sacks with 8.5 (second in the Sun Belt) and has been nominated for just about every defensive award there is.
 He has led the way defensively that has earned its first-ever Sun Belt Championship, its first-ever undefeated regular season, its first 11-win FBS season, its first bowl berth and a Sun Belt-record No. 9 ranking in an FBS poll (AP Top 25).
 This season, along with his team-leading 8.5 sacks and 50 yards lost from sacks, Jackson leads the team in quarterback hurries with 18 and is seventh on the team in tackles with 49. He also leads the team in tackles-for-loss and tackles-for-loss yards with 13.5 and 65, respectively, and has three forced fumbles and a fumble recovery.
 “(He’s) dominated every week, even when getting double-teamed,” CCU head coach Jamey Chadwell said. “He was consistently great every week, but even better off the field for us as far as leadership and maturity and helping our team stay focused all year.”
 Tarron’s teammates admire his work ethic, including senior linebacker Teddy Gallagher.
 “He’s someone that pushes everyone to be better because of just how he works,” Gallagher said. “When the best player on your team is the guy who works hardest on your team, it kind of shapes your team’s whole work ethic, and that is who Tarron is. He’s a first one in, last one out kind of guy. Always working his butt off and always has a smile on his face; never complains.”
 Much like Tarron coming out of high school, the Chants were overlooked at the beginning of this season, picked to finish dead last in the Sun Belt East Division by the conference in the preseason, a division they ended up winning for the first time since joining the conference four years ago.
 "It definitely helps to keep an extra chip on your shoulder," Tarron said. "Whenever I'm working out our doing stuff with the team, we're competing. It's always in the back of our minds, but even though you have the naysayers, we kind of don't focus on all that outside negativity."
 Instead, Tarron and his teammates have focused on what they can control.
 "We just focus on what we're doing day in and day out," he said. "Just trying to grind and get better at something every day. At the end of the day, that's how successful teams are made."
 Tarron has garnered every defensive accolade imaginable this season, including 2020 Bronko Nagurski Trophy finalist, Bednarik Award semifinalist, a 2021 Reese’s Senior Bowl invitee, a three-time Sun Belt Defensive Player of the Week and one-time Walter Camp FBS National Defensive Player of the Week recipient this year. He is also on the Ted Hendricks and Lott IMPACT award watch lists, and was most recently named one of 10 finalists for the 2020-21 Senior CLASS Award in collegiate football, an award that recognizes student- athletes that excel both and on off the field.
 He is also a Walter V. Campbell Trophy semifinalist, having worked with numerous charities and events over his time at Coastal Carolina including volunteering at events such as Tim Tebow’s “Night to Shine” Prom, Caring for Kindergartners, Black History Month Program, pumpkin drives, and Christmas events, according to Coastal Carolina Athletics.
 “It definitely means a lot, man,” Tarron said of being nominated for so many awards. “It’s a blessing to be in the conversation for a lot of guys going to the Reese’s Bowl and to receive a lot of the honors that some great players have had. But I kind of just try to do what I’ve been doing and just focus on that grind. That stuff comes with it from the results of a lot of that work, but like I said, definitely a blessing just to be in the conversation of a lot of those awards and honors.”

However, the national interest, rather than parochial considerations, must guide such a decision. Instead of smugglers and poachers, India's maritime zone and coastline currently face a more malevolent, motivated, and heavily armed threat from sea-borne terrorists and pirates. The suicide boat attack on the USS Cole in 2000 and the sea-borne terrorist attack on Mumbai on 26/11 have redefined the approaches to maritime security worldwide. The Indian Navy has all along adopted a philosophy of arming its OPVs with at least one heavy weapon since, as a senior admiral observed: "Nobody can take seriously a gunboat that has just a 30 mm gun." The navy's Next Generation OPVs, of which 11 were cleared for acquisition last week, are to have not just a heavy gun, but containerised capabilities for a range of tasks that involve combat. The Coast Guard, too, must realise its OPVs are warships and arm them as such.

Moreover, there is an expectation that many members have delayed non-essential medical procedures that will likely be scheduled in 2021.

Per acquisire la proprieta del palazzetto a tre piani Tls ha un'alternativa alla partecipazione alle prossime aste, che potrebbero attrarre fondi d'investimento speculativi intenzionati a comprare l'immobile per poi affittarlo a condizioni piu gravose delle attuali (750 mila euro all'anno mentre in passato, ai tempi di Biotech, il canone era arrivato a 1.8 milioni). L'alternativa e proporre un'offerta di acquisto al giudice, che a quel punto, se ritenesse l'offerta congrua, dovrebbe comunque aprire una procedura competitiva per verificare che altri non propongano un prezzo maggiore. Intanto, pero, a Tls resta poco piu di una settimana per rinnovare il contratto di affitto e non trovarsi nella sgradevole condizione di occupare da abusiva, senza titolo, il Medical Research Center di Siena.

Nonetheless, investors in the cannabis industry are talking up a new era in U.S. policy, despite a lack of evidence that anyone in Washington is willing to push for such dramatic changes. Also, the president-elect has highlighted the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the economy and climate change as his immediate priorities, with nary a word on cannabis policy reform. Absent of a genuine movement for change, a U.S.-centric focus might fray if the status quo remains solidly in place.

So how do you reconcile an NFL prospect with immense physical skills, impressive zip on the ball and excellent work in 2018 but thoroughly unimpressive stats in 2019, including an FBS-leading 17 interceptions last season?
 An NFL official who has spoken to the Dolphins say there's support internally for Utah State's Jordan Love as a quarterback option in the NFL Draft, but likely not at No. 5 overall barring a shift in assessment (and everything in the draft is fluid should Love wow Miami during a predraft workout).
 In fact, there are differing views inside the Dolphins about how high he should go, with some viewing him as a mid-to-late first-rounder and others as a second-rounder, according to a person in touch with the team.
 It seems doubtful he would be available at 18.
 "People are talking about [Love] incessantally," ESPN's Louis Riddick said. "He's going to go much sooner than you expect."
