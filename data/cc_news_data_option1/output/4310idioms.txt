The idea that Black voters take their cues from rappers is rooted in stereotypes about entertainers being the most influential voices in the Black community even when it comes to issues of policy and politics. When longtime Trump supporter Kanye West launched his own presidential bid, some feared that the hip-hop artist would take Black votes from Biden. That hasn’t come close to happening, polls show. And that might not happen with Ice Cube or 50 Cent.

 We finally got a little rain but could use more. COVID-19 isn’t the only thing making the harvest difficult this year. We have also had field fires around central Illinois with this drought.
 Harvesting in dry weather often fills the sky with dust, but I’ve never heard of so many field fires in my life (at least not in the 30 years I’ve been paying attention).
 In these dry conditions, with the corn and beans like dried paper, it doesn’t take much of a spark to set one off. With windy conditions, fires can spread quickly. These fires are perhaps more easily contained than forest fires, but one such fire near Champaign called in five fire departments to put out the blaze. Just so, I’m relieved that Jim and Sean got the crops in safely.

Now, rehearsals revel with the delicate sounds of small chamber ensembles, each musician neatly placed within bounded 6-foot spaces clearly marked with blue painter’s tape.
 The sounds of a Mozart wind octet and a Gabrieli brass fanfare invitingly resonate on warm fall afternoons from the grassy knolls outside the Harding and Smith buildings, but the musicians and their conductors now wear masks of every color and shape.
 If not for the strange facial armaments and the scent of harvested corn, you could imagine yourself for a moment enjoying this music in a Salzburg courtyard.
 However, the colorful face masks and bell covers used to protect the musicians comically telegraph a carnival atmosphere as the euphonium and trombone covers balloon with hot air.
 While the bands’ student musicians and their faculty instructors gently bristle against the confines of today’s pandemic, they have willingly adapted themselves to continue their performance and educational pursuits at the University of Illinois.
 The mask is the new badge of honor for both the student experiencing her conducting class in the Harding building and the musician adjusting a key on his instrument during a rehearsal in Smith.
 For the music family of the Harding Band Building, it is their persistent attitude to keep music and its performance and preservation vital for today and tomorrow’s generations.
 This is the next chapter of the University of Illinois’ band legacy.

_Poirot_ presents the last five of the 70 episodes produced for TV, a video canon covering virtually all of Christie's major Hercule Poirot novels and short stories. This season's last hurrah began, as usual, on PBS. But after two episodes were shown, the series vanished earlier this month. The final three appear, beginning this week, not on broadcast TV, or even on cable — but on a streaming site called Acorn TV. Later this fall, the last three stories in the series will indeed show up on broadcast television, distributed to local public TV stations. But if you're impatient — especially if you're a loyal fan who has watched and enjoyed this series for a quarter century, enjoying it as I do as the TV equivalent of comfort food — the only way to get satisfaction, for now, is to seek out

İlçe Başkanı iken 10 Ağustos 2020 tarihinde genel kurulumuzda seçimle geldik. Allah nasip ederse çok güzel hizmetler yaptık ve yapmaya da devam edeceğiz' diye konuştu.Göreve geldikleri günden bu zamana kadar ilçe teşkilatı olarak kamu kurumlarınca ilçeye sağlanan hizmetler hakkında bilgi veren Başkan Solak, 'İlçede ilk defa organize sanayi yatırımı yaptık. 2019 yılında ihalesi yapılmış olan trafo merkezi için 18 milyon 141 bin 492 lira yatırım söz konusu olup şu ana kadar yüzde 68'i gerçekleştirildi. 02 Nisan 2020 tarihinde Cumhurbaşkanımızın imzalamış olduğu kararname sonucu Mut-Karaman arasında acele kamulaştırma kararı ile ilçeye doğal gaz gelecek.

Harcourt-Smith is a compelling storyteller. During her two-month jet setting romance with Leary, she recalls her conversations with Keith Richards and how she encouraged him to go to America and make albums with the Rolling Stones. And, the spur-of-the-moment trips to Switzerland, Afghanistan, France, and back again. Listening to her tell her tale coupled with Morris’ use of image inserts of colorful Tarot cards and hypnotic music, I felt captivated and often wondered how could Harcourt have such a vivid recollection of her and Leary’s travels on the run from the law. Nevertheless, _My Psychedelic Love Story_ is quite a tale of what seems to have become a largely forgotten part of the turbulent 1970s. Don’t fret, however, as Showtime will be airing it soon. Highly recommended!
