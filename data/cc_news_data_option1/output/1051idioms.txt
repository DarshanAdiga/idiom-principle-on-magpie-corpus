If the media truly needed saving, why move into a directly partisan attack that is guaranteed to push away a significant number of potential readers, in effect reducing the number of potential consumers their union members in this sector rely upon?
 None of this makes sense, but what can you expect from the union that is willing to use dangerous videos in order to scare scabs (union workers refusing to go on strike in order to make ends meet) from taking employment?
 While all of these actions are worrying for the industry, it is truly haunting to see that Unifor actually was allowed to appoint a representative to the committee, which provided recommendations on how the bailout should be handled.

 British journalist Jane Moore explained the school’s rule in an interview with _ITV’s Loose Women._
 Morrow was quoted telling _The Mirror:_ "It's a really great little school actually for the reasons I think that it really focuses on kindness, it's a really big thing in that school and the pastoral care is amazing.”
 "There's a policy that if your child is having a party, unless every child in the class is invited you don’t give out the invites in class, which I think is quite a good thing as you don’t feel excluded."
 The school discourages the concept of best friends because they believe in total inclusion, across the board. "There are signs everywhere saying be kind, that’s the ethos of the school.”
 She concluded by saying,” they don’t encourage you to have best friends."

But of course, it is no surprise to anyone that the political vampires have no real concern for the actual subjects of their supposed activism, if tears will be shed in Catholic churches from Panama to Nigeria over the loss. And if they’ve no concern for the poor, marginalized voices they imbue their benevolence upon, then how could they have any for anything else? Certainly, none for the immense loss of history—a building of over 850 years of age that has seen and survived crusades, revolutions, and occupations.
 They absolutely cannot see the inherent value in such a very ancient place. It can offer nothing useful to the political vampire—no slogans, no campaigns, and certainly no agreement with their positions—so it must be worthless or evil and deserving of destruction. The very thing that made Notre Dame beautiful to many, that it was simply an _observer_ of life, is lost on them. Because it did not speak, it must have been complicit in anything anyone may have done wrong in its near-millennia long existence. That it could not speak is irrelevant to them.
 And I suppose that is sad, isn’t it? Not being able to see the beauty in the world. Feeling more contented by the sight of a pile of smouldering ash and rubble than by the delicate handiwork of a loving artisan. If that is what you become when you sell your soul to be woke, I’m quite happy to keep mine and take a nap.

SmarTrend's candlestick scanner has spotted a possible bullish inside day candle pattern in Griffon Corp (NYSE:GFF) based on the price action in the company's shares. Yesterday's price range of $10.83 and $13.00 is within the prior day's high and low of the day. This trading action often signifies indecision by bulls and bears to drive prices higher or lower and often implies a possible change in trend. Traders and investors interested in shares of Griffon Corp may want to consider an appropriate entry level in the event a reversal to the upside transpires. It is important to look for confirmation.
 Griffon Corporation manufactures building products, specialty plastic films, and electronic information and communication systems. The Company's products include garage doors, materials for disposable diapers, disposable health care products, sensor systems, and information and command and control systems. Griffon sells its products in the United States.
 In the past 52 weeks, shares of Griffon Corp have traded between a low of $10.57 and a high of $25.50 and closed yesterday at $12.98, which is 23% above that low price. Over the last five market days, the 200-day moving average (MA) has gone down 0.2% while the 50-day MA has declined 3.2%.
 Griffon Corp has overhead space with shares priced $12.98, or 50.1% below the average consensus analyst price target of $26.00. The stock should run into initial resistance at its 200-day moving average (MA) of $18.97 and subsequent resistance at its 50-day MA of $19.50.
 SmarTrend is tracking the current trend status for Griffon Corp and will alert subscribers who have GFF in their portfolio or watchlist when shares have changed trend direction.

After seeing a break from showers and storms today, another system is on the way which will give us our first round of showers and thunderstorms starting early Monday morning. Rain accumulation looks to be from half an inch to an inch of rain. By Monday afternoon, showers will diminish briefly giving us overcast conditions. At least temperatures will be closer to seasonal average with highs in the mid 50's. As we head into Tuesday, we will continue to see mostly cloudy conditions with on and off showers as a cold front comes through. Temperatures will not be affected by the front. Temperatures though will reach the lower 60's thanks to southerly winds bringing warmer air from the south. By Wednesday, we will reach the 70's as a warm front makes its way north across the four states. With a warm front, that means a solid chance for showers and thunderstorms for Wednesday and Thursday. Both Wednesday and Thursday will have highs in the 70's. By next weekend, we will finally see the sun again with colder temperatures.
