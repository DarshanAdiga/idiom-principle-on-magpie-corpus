AUBURN, Ala. -- Pat Dye, the Blythe native and legendary football coach who led Auburn's football program to great heights during the 1980s, died Monday. He was 80 years old.
   
 Dye was born Nov. 6, 1939, in Blythe and won a state championship at the Academy of Richmond County in 1956 and played college football at the University of Georgia. He was inducted into the ARC Hall of Fame in 2012.
   
 Dye was hospitalized late last month because of ongoing kidney issues. He tested positive for COVID-19 during his stay, but was asymptomatic according to his son, Pat Dye Jr.
   
 The legendary coach led Auburn to a 99-39-4 overall record in 12 seasons, including nine straight with winning records. The team won four SEC championships, and Dye was named SEC Coach of the Year three times.
   
 There wasn't any morning, or any day that went by, where Dye didn't think about how blessed he was to be a part of Auburn. The football program, the university and the community.
   
 That's what he told many of his former players at a reunion of his 1989 Tigers team a little more than six months ago, the Friday before the 2019 Iron Bowl. It was the 30-year anniversary of the first Iron Bowl every played at Jordan- Hare Stadium, a game he was such an integral part of making happen.
   
 "I didn't have anything to do with building it or making it like it is," Dye said. "I just bought into what they already believed."
   
 But Dye did have so much to do with building Auburn into the football program that it is today. He was the first head coach after Doug Barfield, which made him just the second since Ralph "Shug" Jordan's 25-year run ended in 1975. The Tigers went just 29-25-1 during the five seasons prior to his arrival, not making a bowl game once. Dye built them back into a power.
   
 His first coaching job was as an assistant in charge of linebackers at Alabama, on Bear Bryant's staff, where he was from 1965-73. The Crimson Tide defeated the Tigers six times in those nine seasons and won two national championships.
   
 Dye left Tuscaloosa to become the head coach at East Carolina, a job he held from 1974-79. He spent the 1980 season as the head coach at Wyoming, which coincided with Barfield's last season at Auburn. The Tigers went 5-6.
   
 When Dye interviewed for the job, he was asked by a member of the search committee, "How long will it take you to beat Alabama? His reply, famously, was "60 minutes." Auburn lost the first Iron Bowl of his tenure, but won six of the next eight. The last of those wins was played at Jordan-Hare Stadium, on Dec. 2, 1989.
   
 Up until then, every Iron Bowl has been played in either Birmingham, Montgomery or Tuscaloosa. Mostly the former, at a neutral Legion Field that didn't feel all that neutral to those wearing orange and blue. Dye spoke to Bryant a few days after being hired, and told him that he planned on getting the Iron Bowl to Auburn. Bryant told him it wouldn't happen as long as he was in Tuscaloosa. It did six years after his final season.
   
 Dye said before that game that it would be "the most emotional day in Auburn history. "He was right," longtime Auburn athletics director David Housel said. "It was." The Tigers won, 30-20.

It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.

For football fans of Scottish top-flight sides, it is anticipated that they will not be able to return to stadiums when next season begins.
 Social distancing issues will make that impossible, but media will be allowed into grounds to broadcast matches from behind closed doors.
 The Scottish Premiership have released a statement regarding their agreement which will allow supporters to follow their team as closely as possible in the current climate.

“People took that as I'll never go back.
 “But everyone appreciates everything the Premier League is trying to do as well. I don't think it's a case of pure neglect in terms of, 'we're going back to work, get on board', or it's anything like that.
 “There have had very good lines of communication and I've maybe had four or five meetings now.

Dust, grime and stains have no place to hide as Kotara aims to overcome this stigma by elevating his services’ standards to provide clear communication, a thorough work ethic, and a focus on confidentiality for customers.
 “What I typically do is I’ll talk to customers. Then I’ll go to their house and introduce myself and go over what they want done and raise the bar a little bit and do a little extra to clean really [well],” he said. “I think when people do see a guy, they get a little intimidated, but we just keep going forward.”
 Kotara’s business partner helps to break the ice, he said.
 “She’s female, so I think that helps. But I think once they (customers) get to meet me and get to know me a little bit better, there’s no more issues,” Kotara said.
 Together Kotara and his partner begin their day at 8 a.m. to clean about five houses per day, spending about an hour at each location.

There is not a single thing that will come out good in the past week’s events. Businesses that survived the coronavirus are burned to the ground. Employees who returned to work now have no place to work. Surviving businesses will consider relocating and certainly will not reinvest in the community that shows them disrespect.
 Tax payers will foot the bill for police overtime, damaged police cars, fire trucks and other public property.
 We all, including protesters, have the right to free speech. Each and every person regardless of race has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Nowhere are we given a right to injure others, to deface or destroy public or private property, to block public streets and highways.
 We all need to step back and let the system function as it should in a civilized society. If a crime is committed, let the courts determine the punishment. If we want to address our grievances, then we should do so in an orderly form.
 My old daddy had a saying for every situation and there was one that stuck with me after feeling my rights had been violated and I felt the need for revenge. He said, “Son, you have the right to get mad and swing your fist in the air, until you come in contact with someone’s nose.”
 I sure wanted a little peace from the virus news, but this is not what I had in mind.

On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged yet the returned autopsy stated that Floyd showed no signs of asphyxiation or strangulation and that his death was a result of being restrained on his belly, underlying health conditions and intoxicants in his system.
 At this point, I certainly am not defending Chauvin or blaming Floyd. A change in any of the facts and Floyd quite possibly would be alive today. Had Floyd not tried to pass a forged check, he might still be alive. Had Floyd not had serious health conditions, he might still be alive. Had Floyd not had unnamed intoxicants in his body, he might still be alive. Had Chauvin followed protocol, Floyd might still be alive. Had Chauvin shown a little compassion and restraint, Floyd might still be alive. Had any of the other officers stepped in, Floyd might still be alive. As it is, all the events fell into place and Floyd lost his life.
 This brings me to how we handle these situations in America. First, everyone is entitled to a jury of their peers. No one is convicted by the media or keyboard attorneys and no amount of out-of-control rallies, destruction of property or outright thievery will change one single thing in this matter.
 From the very beginning, I never saw anything to lead me to believe Floyd’s death was a result of racism, though it could have been and only time will tell. Never once did I think that the riots were a matter of racism, especially when watching the videos, an equal number of blacks, whites, Hispanics, males and females seem to be taking part in the destruction and theft.
