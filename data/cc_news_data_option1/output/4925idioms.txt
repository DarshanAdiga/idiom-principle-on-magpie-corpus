GARRETT — My name is Ryan DePew. I am currently interning at Purdue Extension- Steuben County with 4-H Youth Development Extension Educator Tami Mosier.
 I decided to complete the internship program with Purdue Extension, because of my passion for 4-H and an uncertainty of my career path for the future. I started my internship back in August. This time of the year is sort of slow for the Extension Office in Steuben County because it is post-fair season. We have been busy working on county rule changes, virtual programing, Spark clubs and budgeting for the next year.
 This internship has provided me a new look on 4-H. It has taken me more in- depth of a “behind the scenes” look of what has goes on to prepare for the year.
 The duties of a 4-H Educator are more than just planning the county fair. Their duties require them to review and teach curriculum to students, host educational camps and Spark clubs, attend workshops, etc.
 My favorite part of the internship is creating curriculum to teach a Spark club to students in grades 6-12 over teen leadership. I am planning on hosting the Spark club in December. My mentor, Tami Mosier, is dedicated to her job. Tami is always busy working to make the community around her and the 4-H program better for our youth. I want to be as dedicated to my career as Tami is to hers!
 If you are unsure of the potential career that you would like to pursue, that is OK. I personally recommend finding an internship that is semi-career orientated. The whole point of an internship is to get on-the-job experience. If you do not like the internship, that is OK. You now know that is not the career you would like to pursue.
 I would like to thank Tami Mosier, 4-H Youth Development Extension Educator, office secretary Linda Bidlack and the staff at Garrett High School for allowing me to partake in an internship while in high school.

Nigeria’s inflation is essentially caused by her deficient supply-side economy, worsened by insecurity and scarcity of forex. Boosting inflow of hard currency through export may not be immediately feasible as a second wave of COVID-19 hamper the demand for crude oil and diaspora remittances wane. Other than crude oil which is the mainstay of Nigeria’s export economy, now in limbo, insecurity has already dented the country’s economy. Additionally, Nigeria’s manufacturing sector lacks the capacity to compete in global market, thus limiting available options for a leap in foreign income. This is why government is running from pillar to post trying desperately to secure foreign survival loans.

Hartl also recommends people get tested even if they are asymptomatic.
 "That's almost the scariest or the hardest thing about this is that you don't want to be asymptomatically infected and then you go about your business and potentially expose others," he said.
 If you do test positive or experience symptoms, Kristina Wieghmink, public information officer for Ottawa County's Department of Public Health, recommends you contact those you have been around.
 "Local and state health departments are backlogged with case investigation, so if you have been in contact with someone, after you test positive or after you have symptoms, please notify those people, so that they can start taking the proper precautions," she said.
 The state health department's three-week pause order is in effect through Dec. 8, unless it's extended. In Kent County, the health department's public health warning, which expands on MDHHS' order, is in place through Jan. 15.
 County health departments agree that with Christmas and New Years approaching, limiting social gatherings will need to continue into next year.
 "I know we all want to gather for the holidays, but we really need to be cautious this year and think about alternate methods on how we can celebrate," Wieghmink said.

Bitcoin rejected the new all-time high but embraced support above $19,000 as it prepares for the liftoff to $22,500. Ethereum reclaimed the ground above $600 ahead of the imminent launch of Ethereum 2.0. Ripple has eyes on $1, but bulls must break the stubborn resistance between $0.7 and $0.75 first. The cryptocurrency market appears to be retreating after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of around $19,882. Over the last 24 hours, the top 50 crypto asset posted considerable gains. For instance, Litecoin soared by 12% to trade above $90; Bitcoin Cash is up 9% to exchange hands at $313, while TRON swung 8% upward to dance at $0.033 at the time of writing. Bitcoin's springboard to $22,500 The bellwether cryptocurrency is trading at $19,540 after reclaiming the ground above $19,500. As discussed earlier, Bitcoin must hold this crucial level to sustain the uptrend targeting $20,000 in the near term. A break above the recent high at $19,882 might catapult BTC into another bullish cycle, perhaps eyeing $22,500. The fear of missing out (FOMO) has started to manifest in the market. Investors expect Bitcoin to enter a price discovery route. Besides, on-chain metrics, as explained earlier, suggests that BTC is just at the beginning of the bull run. BTC/USD 4-hour chart On the downside, support at $19,500 and $19,000 remain key to the ongoing rally. If not guarded firmly, massive selling activity might be triggered, perhaps strong enough to push Bitcoin under $18,000. Note that the 50 SMA is in line to offer support slightly above $18,000, thus the likelihood of BTC rebounding to higher levels. Ethereum breaking out to new yearly highs Ethereum crossed above $600 as predicted on Mondayand has just broken above $620, making new year-to-date highsafter rebounding from the initial support at $600. Ether bulls are intentional when it comes to pushing to new yearly highs, especially with the likely launch of Ethereum 2.0 on December 1. Notably, the staking feature on Ethereum is a catalyst to the uptrend. Therefore, Ether might skyrocket to highs above $700, thereby entering another bullish cycle towards $1,000. ETH/USD 4-hour chart On the flip side, the bullish case to price levels above $630 will be invalidated ifbearish momentum builds under $610 and forces ETH below $600. The next tentative support holds the ground at $560, but if declines stretch further down, Ethereum will seek refuge at $520 and $500, respectively. Ripple eyes $1 if this key resistance is shattered XRP seems to be building upon the support at $0.65. The cross-border token continues to lead other altcoins in the ongoing bullish cycle, as discussed earlier. Trading $0.7 and the next hurdle at $0.75 might boost Ripple significantly towards $1. On the downside, the third-largest cryptocurrency is trading above areas with immense support. Apart from the immediate support at $0.65, Ripple has held above the 50 Simple Moving Average since October. The wide gap made by the 50 SMA above the 100 SMA and 200 SMA hints at bulls remaining in control much longer. XRP/USD 4-hour chart On the other hand, the bullish outlook will be invalidated if Ripple gets rejected at $0.7 and the declines overshoot the tentative support areas at $0.65 and the 100 SMA. Last week's support at $0.45 will come in handy if massive losses materialize. The 100 SM and the 200 SMA will also contribute significantly to stopping the downtrend.

TORINO. Gare truccate, frodi nelle pubbliche forniture e corruzione all'interno delle Asl piemontesi. La Guardia di Finanza di Torino ha eseguito quindici ordinanze di custodia cautelare nei confronti di dipendenti pubblici, commissari di gara, agenti e rappresentanti di alcune imprese accusati, a vario titolo, di corruzione, turbativa d'asta e frode nelle pubbliche forniture.   Il via alle indagini   Le indagini, coordinate dalla Procura di Torino, hanno preso il via a seguito dell'accertamento di un ammanco nell'Azienda ospedaliera universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, per un valore di circa trecento mila euro, di un costoso prodotto farmaceutico, il Bon Alive, causato dalla condotta di un'incaricata di un'impresa torinese che si e avvalsa della "collaborazione" di un dipendente pubblico. In cambio di tangenti, l'uomo ha modificato le richieste d'ordine al provveditorato-economato dell'ospedale Cto di Torino, apponendo firme false di altri infermieri per il reintegro delle giacenze del prodotto che, pur risultando essere stato pagato, non veniva utilizzato nelle sale operatorie ne tantomeno risultava stoccato in magazzino. Dopo aver ricevuto il prodotto ordinato, il dipendente lo ha riconsegnarlo alla rappresentante dell'azienda che lo aveva fornito. Le successive indagini hanno consentito di risalire a numerose condotte illecite nell'ambito di alcune gare d'appalto, da agenti e rappresentanti d'impresa e da componenti delle commissioni nominati da alcune Asl. E' emerso un collaudato e articolato sistema di interazioni fra soggetti privati e commissari di gara, finalizzato a truccare le gare d'appalto attraverso la modifica dei relativi capitolati, l'attribuzione di punteggi di favore e la rivelazione di informazioni riservate.
 PUBBLICITÀ
 Le gare nel mirino  
 Nel mirino della Procura e della Guardia di Finanza sono finite, in particolare, tre gare: la prima, bandita dall'Asl To4, per la fornitura di camici chirurgici sterili monouso, in cui e stato accertato che alcuni membri della commissione della gara d'appalto hanno favorito un'impresa modificando il capitolato di gara e attribuendole punteggi elevati, in cambio di oggetti preziosi; la seconda gara, bandita dalla Aou Maggiore della Carita di Novara, per la fornitura di distributori di divise e giacche in tnt, per la quale e stato accertato che alcuni incaricati e agenti di un'impresa veneta hanno fornito puntuali istruzioni a un dipendente pubblico della struttura, al fine di sospendere la gara d'appalto e redigere un nuovo capitolato conforme alle richieste ricevute; la terza gara, bandita dalle Asl di Asti e Alessandria, nonche dall'Azienda ospedaliera SS Antonio e Biagio e C. Arrigo di Alessandria, per la fornitura di prodotti e apparecchiature chemioterapiche, per la quale e' emerso che diversi agenti e incaricati di un'impresa modenese hanno consegnato a un membro della commissione, a seguito dell'aggiudicazione di un lotto per la fornitura di beni del valore di quasi 1 milione di euro, orecchini in oro rosa e topazi azzurri. Il valore complessivo delle gare d'appalto oggetto di turbativa ammonta a circa 3.5 milioni di euro. Nel corso dell'operazione i finanzieri hanno, infine, sequestrato disponibilita finanziarie e beni per quasi 300.000 euro, riconducibili al profitto degli illeciti penali commessi.

I medici di famiglia potranno sottoporre al tampone soltanto i propri pazienti che sono venuti a contatto con una persona positiva. Al momento della segnalazione il dottore, oltre a invitare il paziente a mettersi in quarantena, inserira nel sistema informatico aziendale i dati del paziente e della persona con la quale questi e venuto in contatto. Entro 10 giorni il medico effettuera il tampone rapido al suo assistito. Se l’esito sara negativo il dottore rilascera subito un certificato e l’utente potra uscire. Nel caso di esito positivo, il medico di famiglia segnalera il paziente al dipartimento di Prevenzione e, nell’ambulatorio dell’Igiene pubblica, il paziente sara sottoposto a tampone molecolare.      La gestione degli appuntamenti per i tamponi verra eseguita da addetti del Cup di Genova che chiameranno il paziente per gli esami negli studi privati dei propri medici, oppure, nel caso di utilizzo dei tre ambulatori pubblici, faranno trovare sulle scrivanie dei medici l’elenco gia pronto dei loro pazienti che necessitano di tampone Covid. Le indicazioni di Alisa prevedono che nel caso di persone in quarantena per essere stati a contatto di soggetti risultati positivi, queste possono scegliere di stare in quarantena per 14 giorni e non effettuare il tampone oppure contattare il proprio medico che entro 10 giorni effettuera il tampone rapido.      «La prima fase e il contatto della persona in quarantena con il proprio medico – spiegano da Asl5 – Dall’esito della valutazione (triage) il medico decidera se programmare il tampone al 10 giorno della quarantena, e il luogo: nel proprio studio o in un ambulatorio di Asl5. Le richieste dei medici di famiglia saranno trasmesse istantaneamente al Cup regionale. I tamponi antigenici rapidi saranno prenotati con una frequenza di 10 minuti, tempo necessario per rilevare l’esito del tampone».      «Per ora i nostri pazienti ci chiedono il vaccino antinfluenzale, non i tamponi per il Covid – spiega il medico di famiglia Francesco Pardini di Lerici – Noi pero siamo pronti. Nei prossimi giorni il tendone davanti alla Venere sara operativo e potremo iniziare a effettuare i tamponi». A oggi 70 medici di famiglia hanno ricevuto le indicazioni per avviare le attivita nel proprio Studio privato e negli ambulatori di Asl5.Come detto, i primi ambulatori di Asl5 pronti per effettuare tamponi sono quello di Luni, La Spezia e Levanto. L’ambulatorio di Luni per Sarzana e la Val di Magra e aperto al pubblico dalle 14 alle 17 dal lunedi al venerdi. All’ex Fitram della Spezia l’ambulatorio e aperto il lunedi dalle 9 alle 13 e dalle 14 alle 17. Il martedi dalle 14 alle 17, mercoledi dalle 9 alle 13 e dalle 14 alle 17. Giovedi dalle 14 alle 17 e venerdi dalle 9 alle 13 e dalle 14 alle 17. A Levanto e attivata una tenda da parte della Croce Rossa in via Moltedi nella zona dei campeggi per i camper che e aperta per i tamponi dal lunedi al sabato dalle 14 alle 15.      La scorsa settimana sono state svolte le attivita di formazione per la vestizione ela svestizione per i medici ed e avvenuta la distribuzione dei dpi e dei tamponi. Da venerdi scorso sono state aperte le segnalazioni che vengono prese in carico dal Cup per organizzare le prenotazioni degli utenti e i programmi di lavoro da consegnare ai medici di famiglia e al personale di supporto Asl5 che opereranno nelle sedi ambulatoriali. –      collecchia@ilsecoloxix. it      (C) RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA
