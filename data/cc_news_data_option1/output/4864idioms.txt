“This was someone who we identified could be safely cared for in the home. We talked with his surgeon as well as his family, and they were very excited about him going home.”
 Otherwise, the patient probably would have spent a few more days in the hospital before transferring to a facility 40 miles away. The family did not want to go through that. “When the patient got home, within a few hours his delirium resolved. It was just stunning,” Paulson recalls. “He and his wife were over the moon about the program.”
 In the early days of the ACH program, the focus was on identifying hospitalized patients who could return home early, thereby shortening their LOS. Now, there is a growing focus on the acute substitution group — patients who are identified in the ED as meeting criteria for an inpatient admission, but can be safely cared for at home.
 “We have had two patients so far from the ED that have been admitted [to the ACH program] with COPD, both of them in their 70s,” Cullinan says. Further, she notes both patients and emergency providers seem comfortable with the option.
 In fact, no patient has declined the option thus far. The emergency providers’ program acceptance can be attributed in part to multiple simulation sessions. This helped staff understand how patients would be identified and admitted to the ACH program. “The multiple sessions helped with different providers,” Cullinan says. “We talked about it, too, with those providers who weren’t actually available at the time [of these sessions]. But even if they weren’t part of a simulation session, this is very easy ... because there are not a lot of extra things to do.”
 Including the ED in the early planning sessions and asking ACH administrators to strongly advocate for the program have been significant keys to the smooth implementation of this option in the emergency setting. In addition, Cullinan sees opportunities to further strengthen the program once the surge in COVID-19 patients eases.
 “We have case managers in the ED who were pulled at one point to do more work in the hospital,” she says. “But I think once we can get them back in the ED, they will be advocates, and they can help us look for [potential] ACH patients.”

One of the biggest environmental benefits of using artificial turf is saving water. We are continuously hearing about the importance of water-saving and how it is one of the biggest global concerns. Every drop matters, and we should try to treat water consumption diligently. Artificial turf can save so much more water in comparison to natural grass. It has been shown that, if you replace one square meter of natural grass with an artificial one, you’ll save up to 60 gallons of water per year. Maintaining artificial turf doesn’t require a lot of water. You just need to spray it with some water once in a while. Mostly to keep it clean and cool it down in the hot weather. And that’s it. Sometimes taking care of the planet means making just small changes that in the long run can have a huge impact.

JJ Williams’ postseason accolades and recognition continues to grow, with the most recent honors list released by the North Dakota High School Athletic Association.
 The All-State Division AAA Team was finalized and announced, and all the players who made the list were voted on by the Division AAA coaches.
 Williams was the only player from Williston High School’s football team to be named to the list, as he made the Second Team All-State.
 As arguably Williston’s best player this season and most relied-upon, the honor comes as no surprise for the senior running back.
 The recognition at the All-State level is also another accolade for Williams on top of what he already received previously.
 On Monday, Nov. 16, the All-Western Dakota Association football awards were announced. Williams made the All-WDA offense as a running back, being one of just five Williston players to get recognition at the All-WDA level.
 Williams’ recognition at the All-State level is certainly deserved, but it is even impressive to see him get that attention with the overwhelming number of players that made the All-State team from the powerhouse schools in Division AAA, namely the schools from Bismarck and Fargo.
 Schools from those cities dominated the list of players named to the team, like Bismarck Century and West Fargo, for example.
 Bismarck Century ended up having the athlete of the year and coach of the year; Andrew Leingang, an offensive lineman, and the head coach, Ron Wingenbach, were rewarded those honors.
 But amongst the big names in Division AAA, WIlliams takes his place. Williams carried a lot of the workload for the Williston offense this year and did well, even with other teams knowing he was going to get a lot of touches.
 He had one of, if not, the best play of the year for Williston, which was a 92-yard touchdown run in the season opener against Bismarck High.
 So Williams’ spot on the All-State team is well-deserved and should be respected considering he was voted to be there by coaches from the the other schools in Division AAA.

“If someone has to be the squeaky wheel to get them to put up or shut up on it, you know, that’s what the city needs,” he said. “Let’s work as a team to try to keep it and make it a sustainable option.”
 While the airport carries the names of both the city and county, the city owns the property and improvements — and pays about $15,000 in town and fire protection taxes on the site. No school or county taxes were levied in 2019, according to the Cattaraugus County Real Property Office.
 The airport construction was approved in 1958, replacing a small grass strip along the Allegheny River, following calls from industrial leaders to build an airport that could handle modern aircraft. The airport opened in June 1959 after a $1.57 million construction — about $14 million adjusted for inflation.
 Shortly after opening, the FAA recommended the runway be lengthened to around a mile in length — a project that, more than 60 years later, has not been undertaken despite several attempts due to the amount of fill necessary to extend the runway as the hillside slopes downward. As such, the airport can not handle jet aircraft, which require much longer takeoff and landing runs than propeller-driven aircraft.
 Regional carrier Mohawk Airlines, and later Allegheny Airlines, operated propeller-driven airliners out of the airport for 11 years. However, rising costs and low passenger counts led to the service being terminated in May 1972.
 The 2019-20 city budget included $250,000 in expenses to $150,000 in revenue — mostly fuel sales and hangar rentals — for about $100,000 in projected losses. The 2020-21 budget shows a smaller expected gap, with $217,600 included for airport operations and $140,000 expected in revenues. Those gaps are covered by the general fund, which is mostly funded by local sales and property taxes, as well as state revenue sharing aid.

Lee says AMP acquired the buildings because real estate was getting expensive in several of Detroit's other neighborhoods. "It was a moment in the Detroit real estate market where basically, if you didn't have a million dollars in cash, you weren't going to be successful in buying anything," she says. The two parcels on Grand River were for sale but had not yet hit the market yet.

Il pm ritiene, attraverso la nuova imputazione, che tra i favori ottenuti da Arnesano, attraverso Siciliano, vi sia anche quello per suo figlio. Le indagini avrebbero fatto emergere la partecipazione del magistrato, su invito del medico, ad una manifestazione nel porto turistico di Brindisi, nel luglio del 2014, riguardante la premiazione della Igeco Costruzioni Spa da parte di una società nautica statunitense. In tale circostanza, Arnesano avrebbe chiesto a Siciliano di intercedere presso l’amministratore della società (nei confronti della quale dichiarava di avere in carico un fascicolo processuale) per far assumere il proprio figlio. A partire dal novembre 2014 e fino a maggio del 2015, questi venne effettivamente assunto presso la Igeco con un contratto a tempo determinato. E poi, da maggio a novembre del 2015, il figlio del pm avrebbe ottenuto un posto di lavoro presso la OMNIA Costruzioni Spa (facente parte del gruppo Igeco).
