A kind and gracious lady, Nelda LaVene Hartley Hadley, completed her life's journey Sunday, April 5, 2020. Her 94 years have been filled with service to others and love for her family.


  She celebrated the simple life, and her generosity, thoughtfulness, and love have been a continual gift to all who knew her.


  She was born in Provo Utah, to Cyril and Lillian Larsen Hartley on November 13, 1925. The family later moved to Ogden Utah. She loved growing up in Ogden and had many fond memories playing with her siblings and friends in the neighborhood. She was also very proud of her beautiful high school (Ogden High).


  She met and married Dean M. Hadley in 1944, and together they had seven children. There was never a time she didn't rise to the occasion when it came to helping her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. They were always her number one priority. For this, she will be remembered forever with love and gratitude.


  Throughout her life, Nelda also generously contributed her time and talents to the community, volunteering at McKay-Dee Hospital for over 33 years. She was a life long devoted member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and her life was a reflection of her deep love for our Savior, Jesus Christ.


  In her free time, she found enjoyment in finding and refinishing old furniture, spending time with her family at Beaver Creek, and working in her yard. Mom was a loyal friend, loved her neighbors, and showed unconditional love to all.


  Surviving are her children: Gary D. Hadley (Carol), Kenneth D. Hadley (Lauri), Sue Hadley Iverson (Gary), Kelly K. Hadley (Carol), and Cathy Hadley Hales, (Jeff). She is also survived by 14 grandchildren, 46 great- grandchildren, and eight great-great-grandchildren (with one more on the way). Nelda was preceded in death by her husband Dean, sons Chris H. Hadley and Jeff L. Hadley her three grandchildren, Chauntel Hadley, Cody Hadley and Misty Hadley, and her siblings, Lynn Hartley, Verl Hartley, and Afton Hartley Wilson.


  Thanks and gratitude from the family go to Barrington Place Special Care Center, Clinton Utah for the beautiful facility and awesome staff who loved and cared for our Mom.


  Private family graveside services will be held on Saturday, April 11, 2020, at West Weber Cemetery, 4592 W. 950 N., West Weber, Utah 84404.

More than 1.5 million cases of the novel coronavirus have been registered worldwide, according to a tally compiled by AFP at 0530 GMT Thursday from official sources. Of the 1,502,478 infections, 87,320 people have died across 192 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China late last year.
 The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organisation (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are only testing the most serious cases. The United States, where the pandemic is spreading most rapidly, has recorded 432,132 cases, including 14,817 deaths. Spain has declared 146,690 cases with 14,555 deaths, and Italy 139,422 infections with 17,669 deaths.
 Europe remains the worst hit continent with 772,592 cases and 61,118 deaths.(AFP) RUP RUP.

Park County Coroner Tim Power, first elected to a two-year term in 2004, has served as county coroner for a little more than 15 years. When he owned Ballard Funeral Home on 19th Street, Power used the building for coroner duties.


  He and Peggy Power sold the business in June 2010. Cody Gortmaker and Myles Haines now own and manage the business.


  Over the past nine or so years, they have slowly made changes to the interior.


  The need for a county-owned and operated facility became apparent last June when Ballard Funeral Home bought a new refrigeration unit, eliminating space previously used for the county’s equipment.


  Coroner operations were temporarily moved into a garage bay at the LEC.


  P&Z approves


  The proposed construction site is zoned for business-light industrial, which allows offices and medical facilities.


  City P&Z members determine if a commercial building’s architecture is compatible to nearby buildings. The nearest building is the law enforcement center.


  While it’s designed with a different appearance than the LEC on the same property, during the P&Z site plan review, Stowell said city staff has no concerns about architectural compatibility.


  Vehicles will access the coroner building via River View Drive and the private driveway that serves the LEC.


  The proposed building would go over some fiber optic, cable TV and electrical circuit cables. The shallow depth of those services is likely in conflict with the building foundation, and is not a preferred situation in any case, Stowell said.


  Noting the city is a property owner, Stowell said it should require the county to remove all utilities from under the proposed building pad.


  Otherwise, the city could end up in the same situation as the coroner building, with utilities in the way of future development, he said.


  Because the coroner is a separate entity from the sheriff’s office, “It just makes sense to move,” Stowell said.

 "A big step forward to a top German team. I've watched a lot of Bayer 04 games up to the season being suspended. As a spectator, it was great fun watching their high tempo, possession football," the 21-year-old said.
 "Bayer 04 Leverkusen are a club with European ambition and I'm happy to soon be part of it."

Fellow Cody High School grad Paige Ballard, a secondary math education major at the University of Nebraska, isn’t looking at a missed graduation, but missed experiences.


  Ballard said going back to school next semester will seem bizarre, due to the abrupt changes this semester and having to go to school in the fall as if nothing happened. As a president of her sorority, Ballard said it was strange to say goodbye to the members of her sorority when they were told to move out and go home.


  “It all happened very fast,” Ballard said. “The day we got the email, girls were already moving out quickly. At first, it seemed like it would be a short thing, that we would all go home and have a short visit with our families before coming back and we would see each other again. But that has not been the case, and it looks like we might not be seeing each other at all for the near future.”


  Bronnenberg and Ballard both spoke of how quickly students were encouraged to leave college campuses, with only those unable to go home being allowed to stay.


  Bronnenberg, whose family has a house in Laramie, said those with their own apartments remained along with the few students staying in dorms, such as the international students with no one to stay with and no way to go home. Ballard returned home to her parents, which she said had its positives and negatives.

  But it was in Europe where the Spaniard’s finest hours came at Anfield as a succession of European heavyweights were overcome in dramatic, and even sometimes brutal fashion. After a 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid in March 2009, Liverpool were ranked No.1 in UEFA’s coefficient rankings.


  Sadly near-misses and political turmoil curtailed Benitez’s final years on Merseyside. Milan gained revenge for Istanbul in the 2007 Champions League final, before a Premier League title challenge in 2008-09 ended in disappointment as Manchester United held off Liverpool. The following year saw a rapid decline in the club’s fortunes as the sale of Xabi Alonso and further debt contributed to a 7th place finish and Benitez’s ultimate departure.

The annual Cody Lion’s Club Easter Egg Hunt was canceled to prevent large crowds of people gathering.


  QT’s Restaurant at the Holiday Inn’s Easter Buffet was also canceled, but the restaurant is still providing a special service. For $65, people will receive a honeyed ham family dinner, served with au gratin potatoes, or roasted turkey breast with stuffing and gravy, as well as fresh steamed asparagus with hollandaise sauce, broccoli salad, dinner rolls and four chocolate eclairs. Orders have to be made by noon Thursday for curbside pickup on Easter Sunday, 11 a.m.-3 p.m.


  Cowtown Candy, as it has done for many years, is making custom Easter baskets, which they are currently shipping or allowing people to pick up from the back door, due to roadwork preventing curbside pickup.


  Owner Kenny Lee said the service was popular this year due to the circumstances, but hasn’t had any significant increase from last year’s orders. The only thing different were how orders were being made.


  “We’ve always done custom Easter baskets. It just seems a lot more popular right now because people are struggling,” Lee said. “We’ve been shipping them out, and we do curbside pickup like we’ve been doing. We’ve done different methods of ordering from last year, such as ordering them by phone or online. We’re really grateful to have people ordering from us right now.”


  Besides the Easter season, Lee said that he and many other businesses have been trying to stay open for their customers, and that it is the mutual generosity between business and customer, supporting each other while still following social isolation guidelines, that have been able to make it work.


  “All of it is, just like other businesses, one, we want to be there for our customers, and two, we want to stay in business after this blows over,” Lee said. “Some of us are closed temporarily, others are trying to stay open, and we’re having to use our imagination to do so. Like Legend Bookstore has taken its inventory online and selling books that way.”


  He said for now Cowtown Candy is taking orders however they can.


  “Everyone in the community is realizing more and more how dependent we are on each other, and realizing how important it is to shop local to support the community,” he said.

Rod Serling would appear on the screen and say something like:


  Meet Neal Brown, a successful football coach who thought he was up on everything the game had to offer him. But he woke up one fine morning and founds his team was scattered all over, there were no practices, no one know when they would play.


  That is the world in which Neal Brown lives today, a Twilight Zone of the unknown. He is caught up in a world that no one has ever seen before using technology he and other coaches never used before to try and keep his team together, to keep it moving forward, to give it an edge.


  The COVID-19 pandemic has moved him and his team, as well as those at all other schools, into areas that are out of the future … a virtual existence rather than the one he went to bed with before this nightmare began, a time when he was face to face with his team, where he had a routine and schedule.


  Now?


  “Our focus with our players really has been to establish a daily routine, Monday through Friday, centered around academics, football meetings with their position coach and twice a week as a team, three meals a day, working out. We recommend some workouts for them,” he said.


  It’s a huge adjustment for players, who are young men who have never been through this before, but for the coaches it is equally a trip into the “Twilight Zone.”


  “This is a new time for coaches as well,” Brown said. “We’ve never had to coach virtually, or however you want to say it. We quiz our players to see how we’re doing as teachers. We’re using all types of technology.”


  Think maybe how it is when you had your first child, if you are a parent and parenting was as new to you as it is the child you brought into the world.


  “We’re learning as we go,” Brown said. “There wasn’t really a plan. The first hurdle was we had to get our guys to understand they needed to approach these meetings just as if they were in our facility. We had to find a place where they’re at, sit down, make sure they have something to write with and write on, make sure they are dressed appropriately to get into the right mindset of learning.

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Police authorities are playing the good Samaritan amid the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced since March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.


  The police is feeding thousands of hungry people daily across the state. Initially, they started with a few hundred food packets, but now over 50,000 people are being fed daily across 15 centres in Kerala.


  The police's open kitchen - called Oru vayar ootaam (loosely translated to feed a stomach) - is gaining in popularity, as many volunteers, non- governmental organisations and student police cadets have come forward to feed the poor and the needy.


  The police personnel are performing their dual role with aplomb --- enforcing lockdown with alacrity and distributing food packets at one go.


  "We don't want people to go hungry. We started in a small way but expanded after we realised the need to feed many. We concentrate mainly around hospitals where people usually go hungry. We're serving senior citizens and destitute as well," said P Vijayan, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kochi Range, and a brain behind the innovative open kitchen.


  Vijayan was the guiding force behind the Student Police Cadets programme in Kerala, which later found national traction.


  "Kerala has taken the lead in many ways as far as tackling Covid-19 is concerned. The state was the first to report about the disease. We alerted the health workers and politicians about Covid-19. There was a timely intervention from the police as well. Now, the results are there for all to see. We can't forget our duties and responsibilities towards the poor and distressed people. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the state police chief have given us admirable support in our endeavours," the IGP said.


  Charitable organisations, tour operators, student bodies and people from all walks of life are also loosening their purse strings for the police's novel initiative.

And while no amount of reconnecting with our children or taking enforced time out from our usually chaotic schedules will ever make up for the loss of lives and livelihoods, it does offer up a bit of the positivity we've been longing for. Because, amid the Covid-related doom and gloom, there's been a growing focus on the good that has come out of this mostly horrible situation and the simple pleasures it's enabled us to appreciate. The most obvious is the sense of community we've managed to foster, with many neighbours getting to know each other - mostly in a virtual sense - for the first time. We haven't lived on our road for long, but now feel very much a part of the community thanks to the WhatsApp group set up by a thoughtful neighbour. It's quickly become one of the most active groups I belong to, and though I can't currently put faces to many of the names, I appreciate their caring posts. I know our road is nothing special; others in the area have been doing the same, as well as joining in with national events such as 'dance on your doorstep!', busting out moves to S Club 7 in unison - from a safe distance of course. It's been the same on local Facebook groups, where vulnerable people who've requested help with shopping and so on have been inundated with offers from people they don't know. Social distancing and self-isolation has also forced families and friends to find new ways to connect. The likes of Zoom and House Party have been an eye-opener, as the technophobes among us - I place myself firmly in this camp - attempt to get down with modern times, often with comedy results. It's been a relief to find that there are laughs to be had amid the misery. We need them more now than we ever have.

The camp was nothing like what I'd expected. Videos from other facilities forwarded between WhatsApp groups showed bare rooms in fixtureless unused apartment blocks, leaky toilets, and barred windows. But when we were led through the barriers to the rows of identical little huts, and given the keys to our temporary one-room homes, it felt like a first night in a cozy university dorm. The room's new furniture still had its Ikea labels on, and everything smelled of disinfectant. A welcome pack containing noodles, shampoo, shower gel, and toothpaste sat on a desk next to a kettle and hairdryer. Almost as soon as I'd unpacked, a WhatsApp message asked me to pick the week's food options from the huge menu -- a mix of Asian and Western dishes, with vegetarian options, for free. And a sign on the back of the door even addressed the occupants as 'campers.'

  You can choose from 29 effects, including black and white, sepia, HDR, and lomo. Currently, there are 13 border options, such as film, grunge, burnt, and Christmas. We appreciated how the app let us preview these borders and effects via a handy thumbnail view. And as with most photo apps, you get integration with Facebook and Twitter.


  Unfortunately, the app doesn't offer some features available with more- powerful image editors on other platforms. Pictures Lab doesn't support layers, curves, and masking, for instance. We also didn't like the app's home screen, which opened a How to Use page every time we started the app (and it couldn't be set to bypass).


  However, Pictures Lab does put more than 300 different photo tweaks at your fingertips. Even better, phones running Windows Phone 7.5 (Mango) get features such as face detection, autofocus, steady mode, and more, when snapping photos.

HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - State officials are admitting that most visitors aren’t adhering to quarantine rules aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Hawaii.Lawmakers are now demanding a better way to track arrivals.There were people out and about on the sidewalks of Waikiki Wednesday evening. But just about everyone had a Hawaii address.“I actually was expecting less people walking around, but I guyess everybody’s trying to get their exercise in, so it’s really good," said Kaimuki resident Charlene Mercier, who was making her first visit to Waikiki in more than two weeks. “I notice the visitors because to me, I think they stick out because we all know to wear our masks,” said Waikiki resident Stephen Danforth.For the last two weeks, everyone arriving in Hawaii has had to self-quarantine for 14 days, the known maximum contagious period for the coronavirus. “Most of them that are flying in, I’m quite certain they’re not following the quarantine order,” Hawaii Adjutant General Kenneth Hara told a special legislative committee Wednesday.“I don’t believe it’s a situation where the majority of those who are ordered to quarantine are not obeying, but we are continuing to look at improving the system as we go along,” said Gov. David Ige at his daily briefing on COVID-19.Local lawmakers on the legislative panel said there should be a way to keep visitors out, period."We should just not have them come in, "said state Sen. Donna Mercado Kim. “It’s costing us more time and effort and using our resources.”“To me, asking local residents to lock down and allowing tourists in is like having a peeing section in a swimming pool. It makes no sense,” said state Sen. Michelle Kidani.Some have been demanding that the state stop flights from coming in to the islands altogether.“I’ve had extensive conversations with the FAA and federal officials, and they’ve informed me that you cannot shut down the airport system, and they would not consider non-aeronautical reasons for shutting down an airport,” said Ige.The governor said the state is considering confining visitors to a single vacant hotel, where they can be adequately monitored during the quarantine period. As for the visitors who are here, at least one of them arrived just a day before the mandatory 14-day quarantine went into effect. We asked him if he would have bene willing to stay in his hotel room for two weeks.“No. No, I wouldn’t have,” said Khalid Iraqi, a Seattle resident who had been planning a two week vacation in Hawaii with his family. “Stay in a hotel room for two weeks? I would have said no. I would have stayed in Seattle.”Copyright 2020 Hawaii News Now. All rights reserved.

As you can imagine creamy sauces will require a soft rounded style of wine such as a New World unoaked Chardonnay whose pure fruit flavour will enhance those of the sauce as would a similar wine from the South of France such as the les Volets Chardonnay.


  Fortified wines should be added at the end of the recipe such as when adding a dash of sherry to soup; try a palo cortado which in style terms is half way between dry and medium sherry in spinach or courgette soup or a dry Oloroso richer style in a vegetable broth.


  Marinating meat in wine before cooking will tenderise and add flavour to meat and fish. Try leaving braising steak in a New World Cabernet or Carmenere such as a Chilean Los Tres Curas Carmenere or the Rolleston Vale Shiraz Cabernet from Australia at the same price for a few hours before casseroling with a little more of the same wine. Matching a wine to drink with it is then very easy as the same wine will be a perfect complement or another more expensive version such as the Pugilist Cabernet or a Chilean Merlot.


  There are some obvious wines to use in Italian dishes as that country’s wines are a great match for dishes using tomatoes and garlic as the native grape varieties use din Chianti such as the Sangiovese or the Nero d’Avola in Sicily have much fruit and fresh acidity to easily complement the tomatoes and garlic in many dishes so you could add a Barbera or a Nero d’Avola to enhance and support the flavours.


  In chicken dishes where wine is a key ingredient in a marinade forming the basis of a sauce then a white wine of your choice with fresh but not concentrated flavours will be ideal. Try a Touraine Sauvignon from the Loire Valley or a traditional Italian Pecorino or Sicilian Catarratto with light lemony overtones.


  Shiraz or Grenache based red wine sauces are great robustly flavoured red wines to add to casseroles though if you want to be traditional then a French Pinot Noir is the wine for Boeuf Bourguignon.


  However, the wine for cooking doesn’t have to break the bank – try a Pinot Noir from the South of France, it’s great to drink with it too. If it’s a special meal then a wine from the same grape from Burgundy such as the Latour Mercurey or New Zealand such as the Escarpment Pinot Noir from Martinborough will be a treat!


  Bon appetit!

That’s because UW, like the vast majority of other universities across the country, has moved to online instruction for the remainder of the spring semester due to concerns about the novel coronavirus COVID-19. And Russell, along with the about 1,000 faculty members teaching courses at UW, has been forced to become especially creative so his students have the best possible experience online – even if it’s not the same as in-person instruction.


  “There is not a good substitution for in-person and in-class interaction when it comes to a studio art class,” says Russell, who is teaching two sections of Drawing I and one section of Drawing II this semester.


  “No matter how well I do it online, it will not be the same, nor as good, as an in-person drawing class. It is a very different experience for me and the students. But it will work for what it is – because it has to.


  “The students will hopefully learn the basic information, concepts and at least some of the actual physical skills required to succeed in my courses,” Russell adds. “They will be adequately prepared for the next level of course they take.”


  For many UW instructors and students in lecture-style courses, the shift to online delivery is not as difficult as it for classes where hands-on activities are an important part of the curriculum. And, for the estimated 65% of faculty members who haven’t taught online-only courses before, the remainder of the semester is something of a new frontier.


  In fact, the change has required almost all UW faculty members to revamp the way they do things. Many are recording lectures and other presentations, and even allowing flexibility in test-taking, so students can move through the courses as their schedules allow. Most have been in regular contact already with students to understand their data and bandwidth limitations.


  Some have created discussion boards to let students interact and express their hopes and concerns, and others are holding Zoom office hours and sessions this week to talk about the plan for the next few weeks and receive input.


  “Everybody is rising to the challenge,” says UW Faculty Senate chair Ken Chestek, a professor in the College of Law. “I’m confident our students will receive good instruction, and we will come out of this with good results at the end.”


  “Our faculty are doing everything in their power to assure that our students are successful,” says Tami Benham-Deal, vice provost for academic personnel.


  Teaching art from home


  Russell, who has never taught a course completely online before, kept busy during the extended spring break preparing himself and his 58 students for the change. He moved his teaching space from UW’s Visual Arts Building into his home, taking over the dining room and turning it into a makeshift office and video recording space. He brought home his basic drawing supplies, an easel, a dry-erase board, a tripod with an iPhone mount, his laptop and many other items to teach with.


  “Creating this home teaching space also means I do not have to enter the Visual Arts Building for the rest of the semester,” says Russell, an accomplished artist whose works inspired by ancient ruins have been exhibited widely during his academic career. “I can practice good social distancing by staying at home – and only go out for essential needs and exercise.”

Enjoying and matching food and wine has always been a pleasurable hobby of mine and easy one to develop. Independent wine merchants are now deemed to be essential businesses and thus still trading online though most have closed their doors to customers except on a click and collect basis for pre-paid orders. We're always happy to help our customers choose wines to match their expectations - it doesn't have to break the bank either - there are many good value wines to choose. It's important to remember that cooking with wine is a great way to use up bottles of wine but not to get rid of unwanted poor quality ones as the flavours are directly transferred to the food, sp off flavours become much more noticeable once heated. There are a few rules of thumb for cooking with wine based on basic chemistry and common sense. For dishes with milk, cream, eggs and butter it is better to add the wine first to prevent curdling and when adding wine as a main ingredient in a sauce it is best to add it at the start so the alcohol evaporates over time and a subtle taste from the wine is developed. As you can imagine creamy sauces will require a soft rounded style of wine such as a New World unoaked Chardonnay whose pure fruit flavour will enhance those of the sauce as would a similar wine from the South of France such as the les Volets Chardonnay. Fortified wines should be added at the end of the recipe such as when adding a dash of sherry to soup; try a palo cortado which in style terms is half way between dry and medium sherry in spinach or courgette soup or a dry Oloroso richer style in a vegetable broth.

A woman in California has been arrested for licking groceries and other items worth $1,800 at a supermarket amid concerns over the spread of the coronavirus, AFP reported.


  Chris Fiore, spokesperson for the South Lake Tahoe Police Department, near the border with Nevada, said that officers were called to the Safeway store on Tuesday after reports emerged of “a customer licking groceries”. “When officers arrived on the scene, a Safeway employee informed them that the suspect put numerous pieces of jewellery from the store on her hands,” he added. “The suspect licked the jewellery then began to load her cart with merchandise from the store.”


  The woman, identified as 53-year-old Jennifer Walker, was arrested for felony vandalism and the merchandise had to be destroyed for fear of contamination.


  An investigation revealed that Walker had no means to purchase any of the items in her cart.   “Walker was subsequently arrested for felony vandalism and was booked in the El Dorado County jail without further incident,” a press release said.


  The United States reported the highest toll in a single day on Tuesday, with 1,973 fatalities, including 779 in New York state alone. By Wednesday evening, the US had 4,31,838 cases of Covid-19, by far the highest anywhere in the world, according to a tracker by Johns Hopkins University.

Unfortunately for the No. 1 overall pick in 2015, his 30 interceptions also led the league. After five years in which his inconsistent play contributed to a 28-42-0 record in the games that Winston started, the team seemed to hesitate to bring him back even before Brady hit the market.

Even though Arsenal have something like £200 million in cash reserves banked I cannot see them or anyone else spending that sort of money on any player. The whole landscape of transfers and football economics has changed and the coming transfer window that has of course been put back like everything else will be a non event. Why the media keep peddling these ridiculous transfer rumours is I expect down to not having anything else to write about whilst knowing transfer rumours are the life blood of us supporters and therefor keeps people reading their copy.

Enjoying and matching food and wine has always been a pleasurable hobby of mine and easy one to develop.


  Independent wine merchants are now deemed to be essential businesses and thus still trading online though most have closed their doors to customers except on a click and collect basis for pre-paid orders. We’re always happy to help our customers choose wines to match their expectations – it doesn’t have to break the bank either – there are many good value wines to choose.


  It’s important to remember that cooking with wine is a great way to use up bottles of wine but not to get rid of unwanted poor quality ones as the flavours are directly transferred to the food, sp off flavours


  become much more noticeable once heated.


  There are a few rules of thumb for cooking with wine based on basic chemistry and common sense. For dishes with milk, cream, eggs and butter it is better to add the wine first to prevent curdling and when


  adding wine as a main ingredient in a sauce it is best to add it at the start so the alcohol evaporates over time and a subtle taste from the wine is developed.

D-day is done for another year.
 With the 2020 Ontario Hockey League priority selections draft in the books, Hockey News North rehashes six picks who we deem notable.
 CONNOR TOMS
 Standout defenceman Connor Toms of the Soo Jr. Greyhounds of the Great North Midget Hockey League became the first local to be picked at the recent OHL priority selections draft.
 Toms, who netted nine goals, 17 assists, 26 points in 38 regular season games for the Jr. Greyhounds in 2019-2020, was taken by the hometown Soo Greyhounds in the third round, 44th overall.
 He is the son of Jeff Toms, who as a hulking left-winger, played three full seasons in the OHL with the Soo Greyhounds after being a lowly 13th-round draft pick from the Oakville midgets back in 1991.
 Jr. Greyhounds head coach Jamie Henderson has plenty good to say about young Toms and his OHL future.
 "Connor has put in a lot of time to develop his craft both on and off the ice since he was a young player. He is a real student of the game and his skill set should definitely flourish at the OHL level as his all-around game continues to mature," Henderson said of Toms.
 The youngster was understandably excited to be drafted by his hometown team and the one that his dad once starred for.
 "It is such an honour to be drafted by the Greyhounds," Toms relayed. "Obviously, I was hoping to be drafted by the local OHL team. It makes it more special that my dad played for the Greyhounds."
 The elder Toms was a member of the Greyhounds 1993 Memorial Cup championship team before ending his OHL career in superb style during the 1993-1994 season with 52 goals, 45 assists, 97 points.
 He then became a ninth-round draft pick to the National Hockey League and went on to play in more than 230 NHL games before embarking on a lengthy pro career in the Swiss elite league.
 As for his son becoming an OHL draft pick of the Greyhounds, Toms noted, "As a family, we are beyond excited for this opportunity."
 MASON CHITARONI
 Mason Chitaroni said he hoped the London Knights would draft him.
 And the Soo Jr. Greyhounds defenceman got his wish.
 Chitaroni, who notched six goals, 13 assists, 19 points in 38 games for the Jr. Greyhounds during the 2019-2020 Great North Midget Hockey League regular season, was picked by London in the fifth round, 99th overall.
 A smooth, fast-skating defender, Chitaroni is the son of Terry Chitaroni, a hard-nosed forward who played four full OHL seasons with the Sudbury Wolves from 1988 to 1992.
 A blue-chip defenceman and a potential steal as a fifth-rounder, Chitaroni said he talked to personnel from the OHL Knights at length before the draft.
 "It was definitely my first choice of where I wanted to go," a happy Chitaroni told Sault This Week. "I am so excited right now. It is amazing to be drafted by such a really good organization like London."
 Chitaroni said that shortly after he learned that London had drafted him, he received a call from Knights scout Steve Warner.
 "He told me that they are happy to have been able to draft me … and I am just so happy to be a part of the London Knights now," Chitaroni gushed. "Like I said, I was hoping London would draft me."
 The younger Chitaroni's skating ability stands out, said his Jr. Greyhounds coach, Jamie Henderson.
 "Mason can flat out skate with the best 2004-birth-year players anywhere. His all-around game has grown tremendously since last summer -- and we have no doubts it will continue to improve over time as an OHL draft pick of the London Knights," Henderson noted.
 Born in the small, northwestern Ontario town of Marathon, Chitaroni and his family moved 255 miles from home to Sault Ste. Marie about four years ago.
 His aforementioned dad, Terry Chitaroni, was drafted by Sudbury in the second round, 17th overall, in 1988 -- the OHL was a 15-team league then -- from the New Liskeard Cubs of the Great North Midget Hockey League.
 As an OHLer, Chitaroni racked up 276 points -- including playoffs -- and spent 629 minutes in penalties as a Wolves standout who became team captain.
 He then played pro in the American Hockey League and in Germany after being an NHL draft pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
 Meanwhile, the younger Chitaroni hopes to follow in his dad's path and have a splendid OHL career of his own.
 "It's like a dream come true to get an opportunity like this," the youngster added.
 DEVIN MAURO
 Speedy center Devin Mauro became the third member of the Soo Jr. Greyhounds of the Great North Midget Hockey League to become a 2020 OHL draft pick.
 The high-scoring Mauro -- who finished second on the Great North scoring chart with 30 goals, 32 assists, 62 points in 38 games -- was taken by the Sudbury Wolves in the 11th round.
 The 2004-birth-year skater is the younger brother of Justin Mauro, who was a 15th-round pick of the Erie Otters at the 2018 OHL draft and who has played the past two seasons for the Blind River Beavers of the Northern Ontario Jr. Hockey League.
 Jamie Henderson, who coached the younger Mauro with the Jr. Greyhound midgets in 2019-2020, said the prolific pivot has a lot going for him.
 "We are really excited for Devin and his family," Henderson said of Mauro's selection by the OHL Wolves. "He has a strong skill set and a real desire to continue to improve and make it to the next level."
 JAKE KOVACS
 Bypassed at the 2019 OHL priority selections draft, the second time up proved to be a bonus for 2003-birth-year forward Jake Kovacs.
 The Sault Ste. Marie product was taken by the Barrie Colts in the 13th round of the 2020 OHL priority selections draft.
 As a rookie, Kovacs led the Soo Thunderbirds of the NOJHL in scoring during the 2019-2020 season with 27 goals, 31 assists, 58 points.
 BRYCE MCCONNELL-BARKER
 Holding the fourth overall pick of the draft, the Soo Greyhounds made centre Bryce McConnell-Barker their first-round choice.
 A 6-foot-1, 162-pound pivot, McConnell-Barker netted 30 goals, 19 assists, 49 points in 33 regular-season games for the London Jr. Knights in 2019-2020.
 Greyhounds general manager Kyle Raftis took note of the "speed, hockey IQ, skill set and goal-scoring ability" of McConnell-Barker.
 TY NELSON
 North Bay Battalion made high-scoring defenceman Ty Nelson the first overall pick of the 2020 OHL draft.
 Nelson played the 2019-2020 season with the Toronto Jr. Canadiens, leading Greater Toronto Hockey League defenders in scoring with 12 goals, 32 assists, 44 points in 44 outings.
 "I like to describe myself as a two-way defenceman," said Nelson, before adding: "I love playing in the offensive zone and really strapping down the defensive zone when necessary. I love to control the pace of the game. I love making those good outlet first passes, and I love quarterbacking the power play and playing on the penalty kill."
 Charles Abbott, who is North Bay's director of scouting, relayed what Nelson will bring to the Battalion, which finished last overall in the 20-team OHL in 2019-2020 and thus had the first pick of the annual draft.
 "Ty is a dynamic defenceman," said Abbott. "He has got all the tools you want in a top pick -- the way he skates, the way he shoots a puck, the way he processes the game in all situations."

In my hometown, racial and class inequalities sparked tension and turmoil. I remember a distinct image: As queer and POC students were walking home from school, a group of Trump supporters had installed “Make America Great Again” flags onto their trucks as they sped around campus and cursed at fellow students. It was an experience that left many traumatized, wondering who the ideals of our nation truly represent.

They are written by someone who is not only comfortable with the pace at which his life is moving, but in fact, indulging in the deliciousness of feeling unhurried.
