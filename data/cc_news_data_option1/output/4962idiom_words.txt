As of this week, an HES code, which is obtained via the Hayat Eve Sığar (HES) app, will be required for all public transportation as well as for entering shopping centers. There will no longer be cash transactions in public transportation, and passengers must have their HES codes synced to a mobile form of payment. This new system will ensure that all passengers’ HES accounts are connected to their public transportation cards, whether it be the IstanbulKart, the Kent Kard or simply a contactless credit card. Passengers will soon be required to have synced their two accounts, namely the HES code and their mobile form of payment. This option to sync your mode of payment with a HES code is offered on both municipality websites as well as the various transportation cards’ websites. The term in Turkish for syncing is “Tanımla” and on these websites you simply enter your HES code, ID or passport number followed by your transportation card number or credit card.

During rehearsals, the female opera singers prepared a broad repertoire to bring together art lovers with works reflecting diverse women&#39;s stories. While one of the works in their repertoire tells the story of the first love a woman experienced in the Baroque period, another work spotlights the tears of a woman cheated in France. The most emotional piece expresses the feelings of a mother lamenting for her son who has not returned from the battlefield in Anatolia.
