He'd travel less than 200 yards away to The Morning Show, Apple TV's big-budget ode to early- morning TV. "I went from one of the biggest sound stages on the lot, The Morning Show, to a tiny closet stage for 104," he explains. "It was my own Upstairs, Downstairs life."

L’invito che rivolgiamo è di osservare con scrupolo le misure imposte, quindi massima collaborazione per far sì che il contagio non si incrementi. La situazione è particolarmente delicata e tutti abbiamo il dovere di adottare cautela per noi stessi e i nostri cari anche durante le visite ai cimiteri.

This more insidious assault on democracy is fundamentally about the exercise of nation-state power through information. Information technologies and architecture—from 5G telecommunications systems to data-driven surveillance both on and off social media—increasingly underpin every aspect of our lives. The architects of these information platforms influence how they are used, who can access the data flowing through them and how, and—for algorithmic platforms—what content is served up to which individuals. As the ability to construct more and more detailed behavioral profiles on each citizen advances, so too do the vectors for influence. This is a contest not just to wield digital tools but also to shape information realities.

There were many ‘newbies’ on this year’s ride, and a group of 11 Lancaster 4-H members and their leader, Brenda Nepper. Nepper from Hickman arranged only two weeks before to ‘rent’ horses from Dusty Barner and his family, owners and operators of Dusty Trails in North Platte. Gentry Barner, Dusty’s daughter bought a trailer that hauled all 11 horses and the tack. “They gave us a discount for so many horses, which rent is paid by the hours rode,” stated Nepper. The members ranged in age from 12 to 19, and their horse experience varied as well, but no untoward incidents occurred with the group under the watchful tutelage of Gentry. “WE LOVED IT! all exclaimed and plans to return next year are in the making. Nepper was introduced to a three-generation 4-H family from Seward, and another ride out to the forest may be in the offing between them before the 23rd trail ride tentatively slated for October 2, 3, 2021.

Malkemus and Parker call the shots on their business, which reports 25 million in sales yearly as they managed to avoid outside investors and banks. When the pandemic hit two weeks before the store on 54th street was initially scheduled to open, they pivoted with staggering inventory deliveries and extending payment terms with partners. The strategy was largely successful as the line mainly consists of what Parker dubs "evergreen" styles. "The gross margin of SJP is the highest of any other line because 85 percent of this collection never goes on sale." Indeed, Parker's philosophy is to have core styles like the Fawn and Rampling that add new colors and materials each season so that the customer can rely on finding a shoe she loves season after season. Any inventory that was dormant during the store shutdowns or canceled can still be delivered or sold and still feels fresh.

 On the podium in Chharch village, BJP leader Prahlad Bharti found himself standing awkwardly next to candidate Suresh Dhakad, who had defeated him on a Congress ticket. And Mr. Scindia’s strong influence, which he successfully thwarted twice to be elected to the Assembly, now looms over him.
 “The BJP is one family, and we welcome those who join us with open arms,” said Mr. Bharti with a smile pasted on his face. “The _sangathan_ is supreme and we will follow its instructions. Anyway Mr. Dhakad was elected for five years so why not let him continue? At least the BJP government is back.”

 The stature and public appeal of Mr. Scindia or ‘Maharaj’ as he is referred to had visibly declined after he switched sides in March, admitted Mr. Singh.
 “It’s like he had a permanent government job, but now holds a contractual one. There is no certainty. How do we resolve the inner conflict to support those we’ve fought against so far? The leadership has told us we needed to be patient. _Apna time aayega_ (Our time will come). ”
 On the banner in the backdrop, portraits of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Mr. Scindia appear on the opposite ends, as if emblematic of the former acrimonious political relationship. “Why are both of them holding rallies separately? This still shows some differences are yet to be resolved,” said Devesh Mohne, a college student. On October 23, Mr. Chouhan addressed the public in the same village.
 A group of 300 BJP workers from Baran district, 150 km away in Rajasthan, are also eagerly listening to the speakers. “Even Sachin Pilot should have joined the BJP. All young leaders within the Congress are being ignored,” said Surendra Khatik.
 Squatting along with another villager, Tarasia Adivasi is miffed at being forcibly told to attend the meeting. “We will anyway vote for whoever we want. I have just come to see the helicopter,” he said. For tribals in the constituency, land grabbing by upper castes was the major poll issue, he said. An owner of 65 bighas, Mr. Tarasia gets to cultivate only five.
 “The Congress dared me to take to the streets, and I am here now. We will make them taste the dust,” Mr. Scindia concludes, amid roaring applause and cheers, and rushes to the helicopter. The mass of 5,000 villagers abruptly breaks off, and they perch atop tree branches and rooftops to wave at the helicopter as it takes off, leaving a cloud of dust behind.
 “We will vote in the wind’s direction,” quipped Mausambi Adivasi. “I didn’t understand what was said from the stage, as they were all shouting in the microphone. I will press the hand button and vote for Mr. Scindia,” said Ms. Mausambi, unaware of the leader’s new political affiliation.

Campaigning for 71 seats that go to the polls in the first phase of the Bihar assembly elections ended on Monday with key leaders locked in a bitter verbal war to shore up their prospects in the southern districts, many of which are ravaged by decades of Maoist violence. A total of 1,066 candidates are in the fray - 114 of them women - in the first phase of the polls that will also decide the fate of six sitting state ministers. Roughly 24.5 million people will vote across 31,380 polling stations.The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is contesting 42 seats and its ally Congress is fighting on 21. The Janata Dal (United) has fielded candidates in 35 constituencies and its ally Bharatiya Janata Party is contesting 29 seats.The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which decided to part ways with the NDA in the state while remaining a part of the ruling coalition at the Centre, is fighting on 41 seats.Chief minister Nitish Kumar addressed meeting at Muzaffarpur and Vaishali, which go to the polls in second phase on November 3. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav addressed more than 60 rallies focused on constituencies going to the polls in the first phase. In meetings at Arwal and Nokha - which go to the polls on Wednesday -- LJP chief Chirag Paswan trained his guns at chief minister Nitish Kumar and his flagship governance promise of Saat Nishchay (seven resolves)."Saat Nishchay is a scheme formulated by him. We will get it probed after an LJP government is formed. And if found guilty, the chief minister will also go to jail," he said.At Nokha in Rohtas district, he also alleged the chief minister "lied" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he built drainage systems and streets, and provide piped water to everybody in the state. "The chief minister says there is no corruption in Bihar, whereas the corruption in Saat Nishchay is the biggest in the history of state" Paswan alleged. The NDA hit back and asked the LJP chief to maintain "decency" with state minister Sanjay Jha likening Paswan to "a monkey dancing to someone else's tunes"."Some people indulge in conspiracies during elections. They want to make a dent in the NDA. On one hand, they criticise chief minister Nitish Kumar but on the other they praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi," said BJP chief JP Nadda in a rally in Aurangabad.At Sakra in Muzaffarpur, Kumar pitched for continuance of development carried out by his government for the last 15 years. "Some leaders get publicity and eyeballs by talking against me. Let them do it. I am not interested in taking any publicity. I have worked for Bihar and will continue to work for the state, if given another chance," he said. After the rally, a slipper was flung at Kumar by some protestors; three men were arrested by police.Addressing women, Kumar said his government was the first to give reservation to women and institute schemes to provide cycles for girl students. "We have built thousands of schools' buildings, round the clock electricity, better health services and all weather roads for better connectivity with block headquarters as well district headquarters," he added.Addressing rallies at Purnia and Aurangabad, Nadda said India, under the leadership of PM Modi, and Bihar, under Kumar, were progressing rapidly. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar have emerged as the synonyms of development whereas RJD and Congress leaders are indulged in playing spoiler politics," he said.Nadda cited the revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, to underline that the NDA was committed to "One nation, One rule" principle. "We have removed all obstacles in the making a grand temple of Lord Ram in Ayodhya," he added.Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad exhorted the people to give another term to Kumar for the sake of progress and prosperity of Bihar. "We are doing politics over development" Prasad said.Yadav continued his attack on Nitish Kumar at Rohtas, alleging the CM could not provide employment and set up industries in the last 15 years. The RJD leader also claimed that things were better for the poor under his father and former CM, Lalu Prasad. "When migrants got stuck, where was his chopper? Then he said, stay where you are," he added. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi addressed a rally in Purnia and attacked the Congress and the RJD on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). "When you were holding protests against CAA/NRC in Seemanchal, these two parties  neither extended their support to us nor did say anything and they preferred to remain silent," he said.

 “The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that access to comprehensive and affordable health insurance coverage is more important than ever,” said Your Health Idaho Executive Director, Pat Kelly. “In a time of so much uncertainty, knowing you have coverage in the event of an emergency is a welcome peace of mind.”
 The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened health concerns across the country. It has also had a significant impact on the daily lives of Idahoans, some of whom have found themselves without employer-sponsored benefits for the first time.

With less than a week to go until our own real-life election, TCM puts a number classic films about political campaigns and elections on its ballot tonight. The lineup starts with 1964’s _The Best Man_ , which screenwriter Gore Vidal adapted from his own play. It stars Henry Fonda, Cliff Robertson and Lee Tracy (in his final big screen role, for which he received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination) and follows the political maneuverings behind the nomination of a presidential candidate. After that is _The Last Hurrah_ (1958), directed by John Ford and starring Spencer Tracy as a longtime mayor preparing for another election campaign. Next up is Preston Sturges’ directorial debut, the political satire _The_ _Great McGinty_ (1940), which earned Sturges a Best Original Screenplay Oscar win. Then it’s Robert Redford in Michael Ritchie’s Oscar-winning comedy/drama _The Candidate_ (1972), followed by Best Picture Oscar winner _All the King’s Men_ (1949), which follows the rise and fall of a ruthless, Huey Long-like (but fictional) politician (portrayed by Best Actor Oscar winner Broderick Crawford).

The mother of two credits her sons, James and Max, as being her source of inspiration to keep striving to work harder. "My husband and I have started to take my 4-year-old to volunteer at our local food bank with us. I want him to grow up knowing the actions he takes can make a difference in the world and in the lives of others, in both big and small ways," shares Bush Lauren. "There's a lot riding on our younger and future generations in terms of making major changes and taking action before it is too late." From recent relief efforts in light of the pandemic to the endless fight to help nourish those who need it most, Bush Lauren is devoted to making an impact. What's next for this inspiring activist? "I would like to get more involved in helping with the climate crisis, as I think it is the most threatening global challenge we will face in my lifetime. And climate change intersects with the issue of hunger in a very tangible way," she says.

Detectives soon identified Leddy as Alvarado's alleged killer, he said. When officers saw him driving away from a Nestor apartment on Sunday and tried to pull him over, he drove off, prompting a brief road chase that ended when he got into a traffic accident and then made a failed attempt to escape on foot, Brown said.

While previous observations have indicated millions of tons of ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the moon’s poles, a pair of studies in the journal Nature Astronomy take the availability of lunar surface water to a new level.
 More than 15,400 square miles of lunar terrain have the capability to trap water in the form of ice, according to a team led by the University of Colorado’s Paul Hayne. That’s 20% more area than previous estimates, he said.

This is not to discount domestic information threats. In fact, the two are deeply connected. Disinformation spouted from domestic political actors, siloed information rabbit holes driven by home-grown tech algorithms, and high levels of distrust in the media ecosystem all make the United States more vulnerable to manipulative tactics. Authoritarian messaging that seeks to paint democratic systems as feckless draws on democracies’ own failings. For example, Russian coverage of the disastrous September debate between President Trump and Vice President Joe Biden mocked the United States as a global laughing stock, chiding the debate as “democracy on display”—an argument made possible by Trump’s abrasive and chaotic performance. Beyond the digital realm, a fracturing traditional media sector and the collapse of local and independent print create information vacuums. Where media outlets in democracies are strapped financially, foreign capital is an attractive supplement, but it comes along with consequences that shape perceptions and can aid propaganda efforts. A partnership between Italian news agency ANSA and China’s state-media outlet Xinhua, for example, is shaping coverage about China in Italy. Meanwhile, even nontraditional information intermediaries in democracies—airlines, sports organizations and other private entities—are vulnerable to coercion by the Chinese Communist Party, which uses access to its consumer market to compel favorable coverage.

ADRIAN -- When Adrian cross country coach Tom MacNaughton entered the 2019 season, he knew he had a special group of runners coming up behind his veterans led by Nathen Letson.
   
 That 2019 campaign proved to be a special one for Adrian, as the Maples finished the best that any Adrian cross country team had done at states in 50 years when they took 13th in the Division 2 final at Michigan International Speedway.
   
 This year, even though Adrian only has one senior in its top five runners with its captain, Riley Malarney, the Maples are aiming to try and make it back to MIS this year, taking its first step towards that goal with a second-place finish at their home pre-regional Saturday.
   
 "We say that 'everybody has the desire to win, but champions have the discipline to train', and we go by that," said MacNaughton. "Our guys are champions and they have the discipline to train, and the result is we do really well at our cross country meets."
   
 That runner-up finish to fellow Southeastern Conference White Division school Chelsea on a cold Saturday morning was led by a individual victory for sophomore Aiden Smith that came down to the final few inches on the 5,000-meter long course that winds through Heritage Park.
   
 Smith had been previously defeated by Chelsea freshman Connor Alford in the season at Heritage, and after a running in a group for most of the race, Alford and Smith broke away towards the end, with Alford getting just ahead of the Maple in the final stages.
   
 This time though, the Adrian runner beat the Chelsea runner, as Smith rallied in the final 400 meters and timed his lunge at the right point as the pair got to the finish line, winning the meet by one-hundredth over the Bulldog for his third win of the season and third in the past four events he's ran in.
   
 The youth movement has been in full swing for the Maples this season, showed by the finishing order on Saturday, as the top three runners for Adrian, and four of the team's five scoring runners, were underclassmen.
   
 Along with Smith, fellow sophomore Ben Schefka was the next runner for Adrian in seventh, while freshman Braylon Petty also took a top 10 in 10th, with Malarney the fourth fastest for the Maples in 12th and sophomore Jake Eagling taking 13th.
   
 "It's all our coaches, pushing our every day and our mileage is high," said Smith. "It's all in the coaches, they do everything for us. They run the practices, all that stuff, the coaches are the main part of our team."
   
 The improvement for the Maples, despite the restrictions placed on all sports by the MHSAA due to the coronavirus threat, has been impressive, especially considering the fact that the team is, despite most of the team having a year in varsity competition under its belts, a team on the younger side.
   
 "We're getting faster through the year, which is what you hope will happen, and I'd say the next two weeks, we expect that trend will continue," said MacNaughton. "Next week's regional is at Lake Erie Metropark, and we'll do well there, and then looking forward very much to the state meet because I think this could be another special year."
   
 With the team looking as strong as it as with the youth it has on the roster, it's a sign of good things to come for the Maples looking towards the end of the year and beyond, as new faces could continue to make a positive impact for years."
   
 "This year, we'll almost certainly finish higher (than we did in 2019), and then the next two years look really, really good," said MacNaughton. "We have a runner who is sitting this year out who is a sophomore who would be our number two runner right now, so when Riley Malarney leaves we'll have Bryce Soule become part of the team, and boy, is he a tremendous runner too, so the next few years for sure look really good, and then our middle school team had a great season going 7-1 and won the county meet, so the future of Adrian High School cross country is looking good for several years down the road."
