In meiner Zeit in Bukarest ging ich nach getaner Arbeit in der Bäckerei immer in das kleine Magazin Mixt in meiner Straße. Ich kaufte meistens Tabak und drei Bier, so dass die Besitzerin schon immer wusste, was ich wollte. »Trei Ursus si un pachet de Lucky, va rog« war der Standardsatz. Das war fast schon so eine Art Ritual.
 In dem Moment, als mir nach vier Bier war, brachte ich es nicht übers Herz, ihr das zu sagen und kaufte dann immer noch in nem anderen Shop ein, zwei Bier, verstand aber plötzlich, was Bukowski meinte mit »I like to change liquor stores frequently because the clerks got to know your habits if you went in night and day and bought huge quantities. I could feel them wondering why I wasn’t dead yet and it made me uncomfortable.«
 Ich spürte plötzlich diese Zärtlichkeit, die in diesem uncomfortable lag. Diese Zärtlichkeit, über das zu schreiben, was du empfindest. Was wirklich deine Erfahrung ist und das ganz ohne Hass.
 Wenn ich in Bukowskis Poesie bin, fühle ich nicht heroisch, dass der eine Weg besser ist als der andere. Da steigt kein Underdog-Pathos in mir hoch. Jeder geht seinen eigenen Weg und findet seine Gründe.
 Bukowski, das ist mir, gerade in dieser gewollten Schlichtheit, oftmals wie atheologische Erbauungsliteratur. Wenn ich mich in irgendeiner Kaschemme, bei irgendeinem gelungenen Desaster mal wieder frage, ob ein planvolles und sicheres Leben in Deutschland nicht vernünftiger gewesen wäre, ob ich diesen ruhelosen Bohemien in mir nicht besser in irgendeinen inneren Kerker hätte, dann reichen mir manchmal einige Gedichtzeilen von ihm.
 »If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start.«

--DocBreak--
In such a storm one might expect a tempestuous minor theme and heaving harmonies. But Bach’s is music of the light even under stormy skies. Minor melodies are rare birds in the skies of the later eighteenth century, and only one of the arias on this collection is in this darker mode. Instead, a sunny theme seems buoyed by the waves, lapping rather than leaping; the tumult is evoked instead by a long crescendo leading up to the soprano’s entrance. The excellent orchestra behind Jaroussky is called _Le Cercle de l’Harmonie_ and it provides the necessary weather for buffeting this ship forward. His finger to the wind, director Jérémie Rhorer finds the gusts and eddies that bring this style to life. Built of simple figures, predictable harmonies, and regular phrases, this is music that lives or dies in performance, and here it soars.

“The brewing community is not really competitive for anybody, everybody is hanging out helping each other. It’s a friendly relationship,” said King.
 They will have a few beers that have been popular at the festivals including Rosemary Saison, Burn Barrel Brown, and Pancakes and Hyrup Stout. With a smaller brewing system, more beer styles can be brewed which means more variety for consumers.
 Pippin and King like all kinds of beers but Pippin likes to brew a more traditional style beer and King likes funky Saisons and stouts, and anything that is a bit more nontraditional. That kind of brewing means you won’t be bored with the different styles of beers to choose from.
 “There will also be beer for the light beer drinkers. I have been playing with a Kolsch style beer with kveik yeast instead of actual lagering and that is turning out pretty good. We will do something like that for the light beer crowd,” said King.
 Dollhouse Road won’t be open seven days a week, at least to start. The only “employees” are King, Pippin and their wives. Friends will also be helping until they get it off the ground. They plan to open in the next 30 days.
 The building isn’t new construction, it was built in the 1920s and was a horse stable, used for community meetings, and was formerly a car parts store.
 The bar has eight taps and is made from used barrels from American Solera with a concrete top that they had to do twice.
 “There was a learning curve,” said Pippin laughing.
 “We are extremely excited to finally get past the construction part and start making beer instead of pretending to be contractors. We are tired of sawdust!” said Pippin.

With a new moon Aug. 18, we have the promise of skies as dark as they get, offering a view of the Milky Way.      A view from a truly dark rural site on a very clear night can be astonishing for anyone not accustomed to such skies. The billowing Milky Way arches through the summer evening sky, with a myriad stars - ranging from bright to very dim, sparkling over your head and on every side.      Yet it's a great time to look even in semi-rural conditions. The Milky Way is so bright, it may still be dimly seen, and the constellations are impressive as always.      Note: A hazy atmosphere will hide most of the Milky Way. Also, avoid street, town and neighborhood lights as much as you can.      Most brilliant of all this summer is the planet Jupiter and, to the left of it, planet Saturn, also very bright. Our giant neighbors in the outer solar system stand out in 2020, beacons of the night sky and easily seen even in an urban sky.      Do what you can to trace the Milky Way. Looking at around 10 p.m. in mid- August, once the sky is dark, the Milky Way stretches from the northeast, creating a backdrop for the famous W-shape of the constellation Cassiopeia, reaching overhead through the Northern Cross (part of Cygnus the Swan), down through Aquilia the Eagle and leading to Sagittarius and Scorpius in the south (low in the south if viewed from mid-northern latitudes).      It is here, in the area of Sagittarius, where the Milky Way is widest. We are literally looking at the central hub of the great spiral galaxy where we live, known collectively as the Milky Way.      The rest of the Milky Way band, which completely encircles the sky, is made up of the spiral arms of this galaxy. The sun and its planets - including Earth - is right in the midst of these arms, about halfway from the edge towards the central hub. We have an inside look at the arms, which from our perspective are overlapping and blend together.      With even a simple pair of binoculars or a telescope of any size, sweep across the Milky Way and see how this hazy band bursts into faint stars. Obviously, the larger the telescope and depending on how dark and clear your skies are, the more you will see and enjoy.      Part of Sagittarius constellation, the stars marking the outline of the "Teapot" is well placed, with the puffy-appearing Milky Way seeming to rise like celestial steam from the Teapot's "spout."      Just with the naked eye, observe how the Milky Way band is curiously split as you look up from the southern sky and Sagittarius, up through Aquilia and Cygnus.      What you are seeing is not a gap, but evidence of a cast, dark nebula of dust obscuring the light of the distant spiral arm stars in the background. You may be a fastidious housekeeper and keep chasing away dust bunnies, but the fact is, dust is everywhere. Dust, as well as gas, permeates the galaxy; from certain nebulous regions, stars are formed.      As you explore the Milky Way deeper with binoculars or a telescope, you can find many more dark nebulae, which are plotted on detailed star atlases.      Also abundant through the Milky Way band are star clusters, some rich and bright, some sparse, some dim and small, but each fascinating to fathom and compare. These star clusters are gatherings of stars, siblings as it were, from the same nebulous star cradle, on their journey in space - bound by gravitation and, I like to muse, mutual affection.      Look for the many-colored stars. White, blue-white, orange and red are common. They bespeak of stellar "life cycles" and variations in temperature, luminosity, chemical makeup and age. Many stars vary in brightness. We are also concluding that most may have planets of their own, evoking our imagination.      Use a star map to delve into the central hub, in the south on a mid-August evening. There are several bright and beautiful nebulous clouds (with names such as the Lagoon, Trifid, Horseshoe and Eagle), "star clouds" and amazing star clusters.   Jupiter and Saturn adds to the heavenly show, to the left of the "Teapot."      This show is free and waiting for you to go out and see.      Keep looking up at the stars!

 While millions of employees across Europe have been cast lifelines by government furlough programs meant to limit mass unemployment, Hombert and legions of other workers on precarious irregular contracts were excluded from that support.

Epic's lawsuit against Google accuses the tech giant of abandoning its idealistic roots and says Android's claim that it's an open ecosystem is a "broken promise."      "In 1998, Google was founded as an exciting young company with a unique motto: 'Don't Be Evil,'" reads the complaint. "Twenty-two years later, Google has relegated its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize." Google declined to comment on the lawsuit.
 Apple earlier Thursday said it chose to remove Fortnite from its App Store because the game violated guidelines Apple says it applies equally to every developer and that are designed to keep the store safe.
 "As a result their Fortnite app has been removed from the store," Apple said in a statement, adding that it'll work with Epic to resolve the issue. "Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer who sells digital goods or services."
 Google also cited rule-breaking by Epic as the reason it removed Fortnite from its digital marketplace. Consumers can still download the game on Android phones using other app stores, such as the Galaxy Store for Samsung devices.
 "While Fortnite remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies," a Google spokesman said. "However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play."

Labor Day Weekend usually marks the start of bowling season in Monroe County.
   
 But bowling centers across Michigan still are closed due to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's executive orders designed to combat the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
   
 It's looking more and more likely that local bowlers will have to cross the border into Toledo to participate in their favorite pastime.
   
 Making matters worse, many other entertainment venues in the state - such as casinos and Top Flight Golf - have been allowed to reopen in some capacity while bowling centers remain shuttered.
   
 The loss of business, combined with a lack of guidance from Whitmer's office has led many bowling centers to take legal action. Last week, the Bowling Centers Association of Michigan (BCAM) filed a lawsuit against Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel in an attempt to be allowed to reopen.
   
 "If we're not open by Labor Day, we'll lose a big part of the league business to Toledo," said Rich Kenny, owner of Forest View Lanes in Temperance. "They don't want to be the odd team out, so they're calling bowling centers in Toledo to try to find a home.
   
 "There's probably a handful of centers in the state that have a serious problem, that's us and those in the north part of the state where centers north of them have opened. Leagues are flocking north and south to ensure they can bowl, and that's very scary.
   
 "These border towns are losing business; that's what is very concerning for everybody."
   
 Forest View was one of five centers named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Whitmer and Nessel. The center reopened its outdoor volleyball complex and its inside and outside dining facilities earlier in the summer, but the bowling alley itself remains closed.
   
 Kenny has been very involved in the effort to reopen Michigan centers. He traveled to Lansing Wednesday to participate in a rally outside of the capitol building, hoping to get the governor's attention.
   
 Kenny said the event drew upwards of 300 people, a mix of center owners and avid bowlers who want to get back on the lanes.
   
 "I already got teams in my leagues who are already going to leagues in Ohio," Kenny said. "They already canceled their spot in my league. That's the reality we're facing right now."
   
 Despite no reopening date in site, Kenny and many other lane owners across the state have spent tens of thousands of dollars revamping their buildings and training their employees to be prepared for that eventual reopening.
   
 "We have dividers between the tables, we sanitize every table and put stickers on them when they've been sanitized," he said. "We have stylus pens they get to keep to use with the scoreboard (touchscreens). We have hand sanitizer at every table, sanitization wipes at every table so they can wipe the computer screens, and the tables and chairs...
   
 "We have QR codes for menus, so customers can use QR codes to order food and drinks without even talking to a server, and they can pay by QR code or contactless payment. We put in temperature checks for our employees, a UV light box you find in the healthcare system to disinfect sterile equipment, that's for the bowling shoes and the bowling balls...
   
 "I have done more than most businesses," he added. "I go to the grocery stores, and they don't even wipe the carts down; you have to do that yourself. No one wipes down the gas station pumps, yet we're being held hostage and being kept closed."
   
 Shane Held, owner of the Monroe Sport Center, said the biggest issue has been the lack of communication between the governor's office and bowling centers. Held says he feels the industry has been "overlooked."
   
 "The whole problem has been that there's no communication with anybody," Held said. "Being that we've been shut down for as many months as everybody has, it's been very, very difficult to say the least, and we would just like to know something so we can let our bowlers know."
   
 Kenny says he believes the age-old stereotype of the dirty, dingy bowling alley is hurting the industry. He added that this stereotype was dredged up at the beginning of the pandemic by late night comedy shows looking for laughs.
   
 "We've probably received more coverage in the last 148 days than we've probably had in the last 50 years," Kenny said. "It's sad, because it's destroyed an industry because people still think this is unsafe...
   
 "We are safer than what people think we are."
   
 Both Kenny and Held pointed to the fact that most of their clientele own their own bowling equipment. But they also already have implemented safety precautions to sanitize gear for patrons that do need it.
   
 For lane owners willing to go above and beyond to ensure a safe environment for their customers and staff, all they want is a chance to reopen their doors.
   
 "We have a lot of things in place, but we have just never been given the opportunity to even open up at half capacity," Held said. "Our center is big enough to definitely keep people safe, even if we skip a pair of lanes or more...
   
 "Just let us open."

O Dr. Disrespect tentou trazer sua violência, velocidade e ímpeto patenteados para o novo jogo de corrida de obstáculos da Mediatonic, _Fall Guys_ ontem, em stream, e saiu exatamente como você poderia esperar.
 Conhecido por sua experiência em jogos de tiro, Doc rejeitou a ideia de que poderia jogar _Fall Guys_ durante o primeiro dia de transmissão na semana passada. Mas aparentemente ele mudou um pouco de opinião.
 Embora o Dr Disrespect esteja transmitindo no YouTube agora após um banimento indefinido da Twitch, as impressionantes estatísticas de audiência do jogo em sua primeira semana após o lançamento na semana passada provavelmente o inspiraram a experimentar o jogo.
 As estatísticas de visualização simultânea do Dr. Disrespect não estão disponíveis ainda, mas sua stream de quatro horas e meia ontem acumulou mais de dois milhões de visualizações. Enquanto isso, um vídeo de 11 minutos postado hoje em seu canal editado para entretenimento de pequeno porte já tem mais de 350.000 visualizações.
 Ele demorou um pouco para entender o jogo. No início houve inúmeras ocasiões em que seu status de novato se mostrou. Mas, à medida que seu tempo de jogo avançava, ele foi capaz de obter uma vitória.
 O Dr. Disrespect não deu nenhuma palavra sobre se planeja continuar jogando _Fall Guys_ , mas se ontem puder ser uma indicação, ele poderia dedicar mais tempo ao título. As probabilidades são, no entanto, de que não acabe sendo um dos seus jogos principais.

Isaiah Wynn can't wait to show how much he's improved.
 The soft-spoken 23-year-old admittedly has had a tough start to his NFL career. Selected 23rd overall in 2018, he had to deal with multiple injuries just to play his first NFL game. After starting eight contests last year, Wynn enters his third season healthy. He hopes that translates to his play on the field.
 "I don't want to speak too much on it because I would rather show it on the field," Wynn said on Monday. "I've been working on my consistency in all aspects. That's one thing that will be a lot different this year -- consistency in all aspects of my game."
 It's hard to get consistency when you're not playing. For Wynn, that's been the big battle.
 As a rookie, Wynn was competing with Trent Brown for the Patriots left tackle job when he suffered a torn Achilles in his first preseason game. It was a tough blow for the Patriots first draft pick of 2018.
 Last year, he won the starting left tackle job out of training camp. Unfortunately, a turf toe injury suffered in Week 2 sent him on the short-term injured reserve. Wynn returned in Week 11 and finished the season as the Patriots starting left tackle.
 He said he learned a lot about the game and himself when he finally got to play.
 "You learn every game," Wynn said. "Especially for me, being out there, actually being out there during those games, I got a feel for what it's like being in the game. It's been good. Now, it's translated to this season so I'm feeling good about it."
 Wynn enters 2020 with plenty to prove. He's a bit undersized at 6-foot-2 for your prototypical tackle, but he remains one of the Patriots most promising players under the age of 25. After right tackle Marcus Cannon opted out of the season, he remains the Patriots best tackle. They'll need him to step up, stay healthy and play well.
 As far as his health goes, Wynn said he's excited because he feels great. That's led him to an offseason where he doesn't have to focus on rehabilitation. That means this is his first NFL offseason where his primary focus will be getting better on the field. He hopes that will translate to the game when the season starts.
 "It's been real good," Wynn said. "This offseason I got the chance just to be able to work on the small things. As far as just strengthening my body as opposed to having to rehab anything given this is kind of my first official offseason that was healthy. I feel great."
 "Just (working on) the small things as far as getting stronger, technique and breaking down film, breaking down opponents. All that stuff. Sometimes it can get overlooked by the bigger picturer but when it all boils down to it, the little things are really what matters."

High school sports have begun, but in the COVID-19 era, they look a little different.
   
 For volleyball teams, they look quite a bit different -- and creative.
   
 MHSAA rules have practice outside for the time being, so teams are making due with what they have to take the sport outside.
   
 Zeeland East is playing on beach volleyball courts at Helder Park, Hamilton is playing on a makeshift grass court in the outfield of a softball field and Holland Christian is playing on a makeshift matted court on its tennis courts.
   
 "We purchased the court off of Facebook Marketplace and my husband drove down to Ohio to pick it up," Holland Christian coach Laura Bindon said. "We have about 100 hours into the set up. Parents were so eager to help because they want their daughters to be able to play the game that they love."
   
 The new court is just part of what is different during COVID-19.
   
 "Heading into August, when we knew that tryouts could take place but they had to be outside, we had a lot of concerns. How safe would it be to be playing on an uneven grass surface? At this level, playing on sand courts changes the game too much and it wouldn't be an accurate reflection of the girls' indoor volleyball abilities. We knew we could do ball control drills, conditioning drills, and team building drills, but we had been doing those all summer in the parking lot and on the tennis court and we were anxious for a better set- up where we could really play," Bindon said. "The opportunity to play on a 'real' court has been incredible. It truly feels like a real volleyball court, and aside from the occasional 'miss' because the sun is in your eyes, you forget that you're even outside. Because the heat was so intense by 10 a.m. yesterday, today we started at 6 a.m. and actually had to wait a few minutes for the sky to get brighter. But, we got to witness a beautiful sunrise. Having the chance to play the game we love, with the people we love, in the beauty of God's creation, has brought so much joy. We don't know what will happen next in our season, but for right now, we're giving our all on the court and we are thankful for each practice."
   
 Hamilton has courts on the flattest part of a softball field.
   
 "We don't know what the immediate future is going to look like and how volleyball and school will progress, but it's been good for us to get back together. The sights and sounds of Hawkeye Volleyball have been good for the soul," Hamilton coach James Mikolajczyk said. "Many volleyball and swim coaches have had to MacGyver solutions. Lots of unconventional work hours put in to give us a chance."
   
 The Chix started their voluntary workouts at the sand courts at Helder Park during the summer and have continued to practice there with official practice.
   
 "It is similar to our summer stuff with more rounds of conditioning in there and a lot of ball-control drills since there are only two nets," Zeeland East coach Sara Mulder said. "We rotate through and have it working pretty well."
   
 Saugatuck is on tennis courts as well, but without a makeshift court. The team is working on ball skills and passing until they can get somewhere with a net. The players are making the most of passing drills using a brick wall.
   
 "We are practicing on our tennis courts," Saugatuck coach Sherri Austin said. "Kids are in pods of 6-8 and stay at same court with same people majority of the time. We also use the outside brick wall on our middle school gym for wall passing drills. It a small jog over and back from the courts. I have been very pleased with our turnout and I have to mention the kids are absolutely awesome. My senior leadership is outstanding and all the kids are working harder than ever, even in past years. They are very grateful as I am, too. We are just happy to be together and doing what we love. "

If further progress in lifetime can be achieved, anode-free lithium metal cells with liquid electrolytes present the most straightforward and low-cost path towards viable high energy density lithium batteries.”

The fall sports season will begin 10 days from today in at least some parts of the state.
 The Florida High School Athletic Association board of directors met Friday morning to discuss how to begin the fall sports season and ultimately voted, 11-5, in favor of beginning practice on Aug. 24 for school districts that deem it safe to play.
 The first date of competition would be Sept. 4, with the current calendar after Sept. 4 remaining as it is.
 The FHSAA also passed an amendment to this option — allowing schools to opt out of the state series by Sept. 18 and also allowing them to work with the FHSAA to create a schedule.
 The board also voted, 10-6, in favor of giving schools a COVID-19 waiver to provide to students, but it is not mandatory.
 The board of directors reviewed four options for returning to play that ranged from start dates anywhere from Aug. 24 to Nov. 30. Option 2, which was a short season with a regional tournament, was quickly dismissed because the majority of individual sports advisory committees were in favor of playing in a state series.
 Then, the discussion turned to a matter of when to start.
 FHSAA board of directors member Carlos Ochoa raised the point that no matter what date was chosen, schools likely wouldn't all be able to start at the same time.
 Thus, he proposed the approved amendment of allowing schools to start whenever they choose, provided they make a decision on playing for the state series by Sept. 18 -- two weeks into the regular season.
 This decision by the FHSAA goes against the advice of its Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, which recommended Option 3B -- an Oct. 12 start date for practice, which would allow for school to begin before athletics.

Mayor of London praises ‘bold vision’ of new Dagenham film studios as project gets green light from City Hall


--DocBreak--
Portsmouth City Councilor Paige Trace is calling on Dover city officials to "get moving" to stop plumes of PFAS and 1,4-dioxane in groundwater from getting any closer to the Bellamy Reservoir, the city of Portsmouth's primary drinking water supply.
   
 PFAS chemicals - commonly known as forever chemicals - and 1,4-dioxane are suspected carcinogens.
   
 Dover officials acknowledged last week that the chemicals have flowed off the Tolend Road landfill and are migrating toward the Bellamy Reservoir.
   
 "You can either be proactive or reactive. You can't take the chance of being reactive," Trace said this week. "In my mind there is no amount of time that isn't soon enough to start preparing for whatever Dover is going to do to stop this plume from contaminating Portsmouth's primary source of water."
   
 Dover officials last week said they plan to have 30% of the design completed by September on a treatment system to stop the spread of the chemicals. The project is estimated to cost Dover $200,000 to $700,000, a consultant told the Dover City Council.
   
 But Trace maintains that's not "fast enough."
   
 "If there were homes between the landfill and the reservoir, the chemicals would be in their well systems now. We don't need another Coakley," Trace said in reference to the Coakley landfill, which like the Tolend Road landfill, is a Superfund cleanup site. "Clean drinking water is the one thing we deserve and need as human beings to survive."
   
 She said it's "impossible to overstate the enormity of the impact" if the reservoir becomes contaminated.
   
 "I don't want to be placed in the position, or to see anyone placed in the position, of having to tell a city we're bringing in pallets of drinking water and you can find them in the Bridge Street parking lot because the Bellamy Reservoir gets contaminated," she said.
   
 "I'm sorry for Dover. I know it's a huge project but they have no choice. They have to show some urgency and take some responsibility for this."
   
 Her comments come after the EPA, in response to requests from Seacoast Media Group, released a statement outlining how far the plumes are from the Bellamy Reservoir. The statement explains the levels of PFAS and 1,4-dioxane found on and off the landfill.
   
 Testing has been done at the site for 1,4-dioxane since May 2009, according to the EPA's statement.
   
 "Detected concentrations have fluctuated between 0.17 and 940 ppb (parts per billion), with trends that can be generally characterized as stable to increasing," the EPA said in the statement.
   
 The EPA describes 1,4-dioxane as "a likely human carcinogen." An EPA fact sheet about the chemical states it's "found at many federal facilities because of its widespread use as a stabilizer in certain chlorinated solvents, paint strippers, greases and waxes." The chemical, the EPA states, "may leach readily from soil to groundwater, migrates rapidly in groundwater and is relatively resistant to biodegradation in the subsurface."
   
 The state Department of Environmental Services in 2018 set a new ambient ground quality standard for 1,4-dioxane of .32 parts per billion.
   
 The EPA reported "the main 1,4 dioxane plume with elevated concentrations of 1,4-dioxane extends to approximately 800 feet south of the toe of the landfill, or approximately 900 feet from the northern edge of the Bellamy Reservoir."
   
 Results from the four monitoring wells closest to the reservoir had concentrations of 2 to 7 ppb, the EPA said.
   
 A sample taken at the reservoir's intake came back non-detect, the EPA said.
   
 The former landfill sits on a 50-acre site off Tolend Road, and the southern boundary is about 2,000 feet from the Bellamy Reservoir, according to the EPA's website.
   
 "Owned and operated by the city of Dover from 1960 until its closure in 1980, the landfill accepted domestic and industrial waste," the EPA states. "Buried materials include leather-tanning wastes, organic solvents, municipal trash and sludge from the Dover wastewater plant."
   
 Tests have been done for PFAS at the site since 2018 and have found PFAS at a wide range of levels, the EPA said.
   
 Results for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) have ranged from non-detect to 890 parts per trillion (ppt), perfluoro-n-octanoic acid (PFOA) test results have ranged from non-detect to 1,100 ppt, results for perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have ranged from non-detect to 1,500 ppt and results for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) ranged from non-detect to 630 ppt, the EPA said.
   
 "The highest concentration of PFAS compounds is at the toe of the landfill, similar to the 1,4-dioxane concentrations," the EPA said in the statement. "The main PFAS plume with elevated concentrations of PFAS compounds extends to approximately the same length as the 1,4-dioxane plume."
   
 The EPA's health advisories for PFOS and PFOA are 70 ppt but NHDES has stricter standards.
   
 PFAS are man-made chemicals that have been used in products worldwide since the 1950s, including firefighting foam, non-stick cookware and water-repellent fabrics. They also have a range of applications in the aerospace, aviation, automotive and electronics industries, among others.
   
 In addition to being a suspected carcinogen, the Agency For Toxic Substances and Disease Registry states PFAS exposure can harm childhood development, increase cholesterol levels, hurt the immune system and interfere with the human body's hormones.
   
 Brian Goetz, deputy director of public works for the city of Portsmouth, said last week that despite concerns about PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, "there's no detection of anything that has gotten into the reservoir."
   
 "Granted, the landfall is adjacent to the reservoir ... and the migration is a concern of ours," he said.
   
 Dover City Manager Michael Joyal said last week the chemicals "are not currently threatening the reservoir."
   
 "I think not just Portsmouth, but we too are concerned and we want to make sure that whatever contaminants are emanating from the landfill are held in check," Joyal said. "Right now, there's no immediate threat to the Bellamy Reservoir."
   
 Dover Mayor Robert Carrier said the chemicals that have migrated off the landfill are a "major concern."
   
 Told about Trace's comments, he said, "We actually are aggressively going after that. We understand the urgency of it. We're working with EPA and DES. There's a big team working on it. It's a top priority; we have to protect the water source."
   
 In terms of next steps, the EPA said this week "annual monitoring of all these contaminants will continue - the next sampling round is planned for this fall."
   
 "The responsible parties (that used the landfill) are preparing a 30% design report for an expansion of the current extraction system and network of monitoring wells," the EPA said.
   
 The system is aimed at eliminating or minimizing "the level of contaminants in the leachate emanating from the landfill and groundwater flowing down-gradient of the landfill," the EPA said. The system also is intended to "prevent the discharge of impacted groundwater from the site from entering surface water bodies above concentrations that are protective of human health and the environment."
   
 The system is expected to be completed in 2021.

The biggest questions facing NU and the Big Ten after the cancellation of fall sports
 This is where we should acknowledge that Nebraska also is a better fit in the Big 12 geographically, culturally, politically and historically.
 What's more, Frost's style of football frankly fits better in the Big 12. Come to think of it, so does Fred Hoiberg's space-and-pace style of basketball. The Big Ten is about getting touches in the paint and managing the shot clock.
 This is where we should go back to what I said about Nebraska being patient with the Big Ten. This might be a good time to think about what this marriage could _become_. Think about 10 years down the road. What if Nebraska is regularly competing for Big Ten football championships, and maybe winning titles two out of every five years or so? On the academic front, the Big Ten means instant credibility. When it joined the Big Ten, NU was admitted into the Big Ten Plus Engineering Consortium, which has been called “the single- best collection of colleges of engineering in the world.”

Some parents at the meeting expressed disappointment that the name wasn’t being immediately taken off the school and concern that the proposal leaves room for the current name to stand.
 “On one hand, we’re saying that the name has to change, that Agassiz stood for anti-Black ideology and we live with that legacy today,” Agassiz parent Chirag Mehta said. “Yet we have a process here where we could still end up with Agassiz’s name on the school.”
 Mehta is a founding member of Chicagoans for Anti-Racist Education (CARE), a group of parents and alumni who recently pushed to re-open discussions about the school’s name after a bid to change it failed in 2017.
 “I get the commitment to process here, to leave space for students to go through the inquiry that leads them to conclusion,” Mehta said. “However, as leaders it feels like we ought to be being super clear that the name has to change.”
 Weber said she didn’t feel it was her place to tell students or community members what names — including Agassiz — they could or could not consider during this fall’s process.
 “I’m not 100 percent sure we’re starting at a place where the name is going to be changed, that we’re not going back to the process of ‘Does the name even need to be changed?‘” parent and LSC member Alex Lopez said. “It worries me that we had this process three years ago, that we see what we see in the news, and when we talk about our school being safe and equitable, that having someone’s name on the front of the building who would call me a ‘hybrid being’ feels safe or equitable to anyone.”
 As a 19th century scientist and teacher, Agassiz strongly denounced interracial relationships.
 “I do believe,” Lopez continued, “that if we’re going to show our kids that we’re taking their safety and their well-being and their society seriously, then the man who would’ve called our family a sin against God should not be on the back of their Fun Run shirt.”

NEW YORK - R. Kelly's manager has been arrested on charges that he threatened a shooting at a Manhattan theatre two years ago, forcing an evacuation and the cancellation of the screening of a documentary addressing allegations that the singer had sexually abused women and girls.
 Donnell Russell, 45, of Chicago, was charged with conspiracy and with threatening physical harm by interstate communication. He was scheduled to appear remotely Friday before a magistrate judge in Manhattan federal court. It was not immediately clear who will represent him in court.
 The charge comes on the heels of Russell being charged in Brooklyn federal court earlier this week with harassing a Kelly victim and her mother after the unidentified woman filed a lawsuit against Kelly. Authorities said Russell sent a letter to the woman’s lawyer with cropped nude photographs of her and later sent her a text warning her: “Pull the plug or you will be exposed.”
