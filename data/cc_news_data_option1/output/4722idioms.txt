You tend to find out, if the products not working, or if there's an unforeseen safety event sometime before the final data readout, right? I mean, if there was something that we didn't understand about the GIP mechanism, and you get now into 10s of thousands of patients, we have data safety monitoring boards with all these trials, right? I mean, those tend to hit you out of the blue more than when you put it all together. I don't mean to imply that there won't be a huge safety database, you have to look at things here, and maybe we'll learn some stuff. But I think, again, maybe part of what Mike's comment, I've never been more excited as program of this magnitude, as you know, every day that passes without some bad news call is a good day, right?

I think the good thing is, we see a light at the end of the tunnel with vaccines, but the first half of next year is going to be -- it's going to be tough to predict, I think for all of us, and we are seeing shutdowns and other things. I think the one thing that is good relative to the first, whatever you want to define it as wave or back in first part of this year. I think even as we're seeing more significant restrictions in states, here in the U.S., physician's offices, I think physicians have figured out ways to keep their practices open and get patients in other than COVID patients where, as you remember back in April or May, we were seeing a really significant shutdown in sort of healthcare utilization. We're not seeing that to the same degree. So that I think we're -- the impacts from shutdowns or restrictions is probably more moderate now than it was at the beginning of the pandemic.

I think from a legislative perspective, almost independent of who controls the Senate, I think we see probably a relatively narrow sort of path in '21 for drug pricing types of impacts.

I think, we look at many of the elements that are in the Grassley, Wyden bill and those are probably the kind of things that have some ability to get attached to bills or make it through legislation in '21, being much more likely than some of the bigger house, Democrat bills and ideas that we've seen.

Outside of his work on the referendum, Kazmierczak worked to create an equity commitment in WBLAS. The district conducted an internal equity audit, and in light of the killing of George Floyd and how conversations about race have evolved, the timing of the results positioned Kazmierczak and the district to develop and implement both meaningful and actionable equity strategies for the district.
 “The equity commitment statement emerged from our strategic planning, and a group of staff and community members developed the statement. It is critically important that we consider the impact of decisions on all of our students and families,” Kazmierczak said.
 Under the superintendent’s leadership and in line with the district’s strategic plan and commitment to eliminating systemic racism, the district began tackling grading disparities a year ago when it dramatically changed its grading practices.
 “Dr. Kazmierczak has quickly become a beacon of leadership and inspiration across the state during his time at White Bear Lake,” said MASA Executive Director Dr. Deb Henton. “He has made immediate relationships with his staff and the surrounding community. It is clear (that) under his direction the district is poised to make positive impacts now and into the future.”
 This isn’t Kazmierczak’s first award from MASA. In 2012, he was the recipient of both the Richard Green Scholar Award and the Outstanding Central Office Leader Award. He has also been an active member with the organization for years, serving on the MASA Board of Directors from 2010-2017. His involvement also includes membership on the Federal Advocacy and Legislative committees.
 Kazmierczak is also an active member in the community. He is a member of Rotary, Vadnais Heights Economic Development Corporation, White Bear Lake Area Education Foundation and the Minnesota School District Liquid Asset Fund Board of Trustees. He also has three children who attend school in the district.
 “Being selected by a committee of members from a variety of Minnesota educational organizations is humbling. White Bear Lake is being noticed, and this award is far more than an individual achievement; it is representative of the collective efforts of many,” Kazmierczak said.

SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) -- It’s been a frigid day with highs only making it into the lower 30s this afternoon along with a gusty breeze. Skies have been sunny for the valley after waking up to a little snow this morning!
 Skies remain clear tonight with a risk for some scattered clouds after midnight. With high pressure dominating, wind should become light to calm, allowing temperatures to fall into the teens for most of western Mass. We may break the record low of 14, set back in 2014 in Springfield.
 Breezes will increase again Thursday, shifting out of the south-southwest as high pressure moves offshore. Temperatures return to the 40s, but it will feel cooler with gusty breezes on tap for the afternoon.
 The trough that brought our cold weather continues to lift out of New England through the end of the week. Temperatures will follow suit, climbing back above normal by Friday and then hover near normal over the weekend. At the surface, high pressure will linger to our south while low pressure passes to our north. Gusty breezes are likely Thursday and Friday with some gusts potentially topping 40mph at times, especially Thursday evening and Friday morning.
 Wind relaxes this weekend and temperatures hover closer to normal with highs in the 50s Saturday. By Sunday, high pressure builds to our northeast, which will keep temps cooler and we may see a spot shower along with mainly cloudy skies. Our next cold front comes in Monday with likely showers and gusty breezes. Another front will bring showers later Wednesday, which should clear out by Thanksgiving.

 # UTEP defense looks to regroup after UTSA debacle
 Bret Bloomquist
 El Paso Times
 By the middle of the second quarter last week against UTSA, much was set against the UTEP defense.
 For various reasons, the Miners were missing three of their top five cornerbacks, and the Miners failed to respond as the game spiraled.
 The hope is that one bad game, 33 poor minutes, isn't a sign of a bigger trend. As UTEP goes through a two-week preparation for Rice, the Miners' focus is regaining a swagger that saw the defense play well, at a higher level than they played at in years, in five of the first six games.
 Coach Dana Dimel does indeed think the UTSA mess was a one-off. UTEP started fine despite missing cornerbacks Dennis Barnes and Robert Corner, but when star cornerback Duron Lowe was ejected, UTEP was ill-equipped to go five deep at the position.
 "We got shook a little bit when Duron went down and we had to put (true freshman) Ilijah in, a freshman who only had two practices with the varsity all year," Dimel said. "We were playing good defense until then, then they scored 14 points in the last three minutes of the half and it rattled our defense. We never recovered.
 "We lost a lot of momentum, when they got the two score lead they were able to take control of the game. It was more the structure of the game than anything.
 "We'll regroup. Now it's time to move on, we can't let one half of football define what we've done all year. We have to get back to what we'd been doing."
 Those last three sentences form the operative part going forward.
 "There are plenty of things we can look at that were one-time situations: D-Lowe getting thrown out of the game, the COVID stuff, guys not being able to travel," linebacker Stephen Forester said.
 "That's not going to happen every week, so we can look at that and say it was a one-time thing. It was unfortunate circumstances, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter what the circumstances are. We have to come out and that's what we'll continue to do. We'll come out and play."
 As to how UTEP goes about that, Forester did admit to being a bit stumped. He said he feels feels each player will have to work it out himself.
 "It's tough, it comes down to individuals," he said. "I honestly don't know, I wish I knew the answer to that, but this is my first time being in this situation. We learn as we go. I think it's kind of an individual mentality, to say we're going to overcome this and come back next week."
 Defensive end Praise Amaewhule said the defense needs to look at the roll it was on before the end of the first half against UTSA.
 "We're a great defense, you've seen it all year," he said. "We've played at a higher level, then this last week we had some guys make a couple of mental mistakes, mental errors, penalties and they played a big role.
 "We're a great defense, we're playing better, we'll come back. We have to do our jobs, eliminate the errors, be assignment sound, be smarter. At the end of the day, this is what we signed up to do, play football. We have to do our jobs.
 "We have to stay together, keep our minds sharp. Keep focused and rally together."
 UTEP has plenty of time to rally before it plays Rice next week, plenty of time to find the level it played at for most of this year.

NORTH ADAMS — There are just a handful of lights on inside the closed State Street Tavern, where a humidifier runs constantly to prevent mold. The bar has been shut for more than eight months, but the bills keep coming.
 “If we had a mortgage to pay, we’d already be gone,” said co-owner Dennis St. Pierre.
 Like other bar and restaurant owners, St. Pierre and Bob Cellana still have to shell out money for insurance, licenses, electricity and, soon, heating — even when they cannot open their doors.
 But, there finally is some good news for the bar. At the start of the year, St. Pierre and Cellana paid $1,575 to renew an alcohol license they would end up using for fewer than three months. Now, the city has all but waived the cost for next year’s license.
 On Tuesday, the North Adams Licensing Board set the renewal fee at just $100. Business owners celebrated, even as they recognized that the relief is just a drop in the bucket.
 “It’s a little bit of help,” Cellana acknowledged. He said they have no plans to close the bar, which has been a staple of the city for more than three decades. But, the idea of making it through the winter with no revenue is daunting. They have not been able to receive any federal or state financial aid, he said, and the heating costs alone could reach hundreds of dollars a month.
 “Whatever it takes, we’ll be here,” St. Pierre said. “But, we need to open up.”
 Most years, establishments that serve alcohol in North Adams pay $900 to $1,575 to the city to keep their license. But, this time, the board decided that business owners will need that cash more than the city next year. Board members estimated that the change will mean a decline in revenue for North Adams of upward of $25,000.
 “I think a thousand dollars is more important to them, so they can pay the rent ... than to get a thousand dollars for the city,” said Licensing Board member Peter Breen. “The city budget is going to be short, and I understand that.”
 Breen pointed out that a number of licensed venues are in the same boat as State Street Tavern. Some spots have been paying insurance, rent and other bills without being able to open for eight months. Even those still open have seen significant declines in business.
 “Things are hard,” Breen said. “A lot of these businesses, if they go out, they don’t come back.”
 Bars and clubs without food service cannot reopen until the state hits Phase Four amid the coronavirus pandemic, when a vaccine and/or treatments allow the state to return to a “new normal.”
 In North Adams, those venues include the State Street Tavern, HiLo and The Mohawk Tavern, as well as private clubs — the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Elks.
 And even with a vaccine on the horizon, Licensing Board members predicted that the start of 2021 will look a lot like most of 2020 for those venues.
 “I don’t think things are gonna move as quickly as we hoped they would, as far as a vaccine,” said board Secretary Rosemari Dickinson. “It’s quick, but is it going to be quick enough to hit our little area?”
 The fee reduction does not apply to liquor and package stores, which committee members agreed had not been significantly affected by the pandemic or state restrictions.
 North Adams follows several other municipalities that also have reduced or cut fees to give businesses some relief. In Dalton, officials waived the fee but said they might charge businesses a prorated fee later next year. North Adams officials considered a prorated fee plan but ultimately rejected it over concerns that restaurants and bars would not be able to pay the full fee when they finally kicked back into gear.
 At the State Street Tavern, those startup costs weigh on St. Pierre's mind. He said the length of the pandemic has become a major financial drain, and that reopening will be yet another challenge.
 “When we do open up, it’ll be like starting over, with no money in the bank at all,” he said.
 Just down the road from the tavern, the Key West Lounge has been able to stay open serving food. But, the money will make a difference for that venue, too, said owner Michael Bloom. His business has taken a hit this year.
 “Sales are down,” he said. “Hours are reduced. You know, people don't come out like they used to.”
 Unlike some of the city’s larger restaurants, the lounge has no plans to stay open for takeout if North Adams faces a second shutdown on in-person dining similar to Pittsfield’s. And even with limited food service, the operating costs add up.
 “You've got your utilities, your licensing fees, so, that is significant for any business to have a reduction of $1,500,” he said. “That's a great savings, and we appreciate it.”

The one thing I would add to that, too, is like we're seeing not just in the PPE, but even with the launching of Mood Ring in Canada, We actually are very fortunate to have Lonza as a partner in the capsules.
