PORTLAND, Ore. — A man livestreaming a Proud Boys rally held here was knocked to the ground and kicked in the face by a protester Saturday, and police have now launched an investigation.
 “An investigation into this assault case is underway,” Portland police said Saturday, linking to video of the attack.
 It's unclear what led to the incident, but police have asked any witnesses to email crimetips@portlandoregon.gov.
 Thousands of Proud Boys, the far-right Pacific Northwest group known for causing chaos and violence, were promised at Delta Park Saturday, but only about 200 showed up, many wearing militarized body armor, according to KOIN.
 Several arrests were made, including a driver who was cited for obscuring the car’s license plate. Officials confiscated firearms, paintball guns, bats and shields.
 Two people were charged with unlawful possession of a loaded firearm in public.
 The Proud Boys organizer told KOIN that they wrapped up the event early to go to a barbecue.
 An anti-fascism rally down the road drew a much larger crowd, including Caesar the No Drama Llama.
 “Thank you to our police officers and law enforcement partners for ensuring the demonstrations have remained largely peaceful throughout the day,” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a statement. “It’s testimony to the collaborative planning and preparation Portland Police did with our local, state and federal partners.”
 Oregon Gov. Kate Brown had declared a state of emergency Friday and ordered state troopers and sheriff’s deputies to Portland in anticipation of clashes between the Proud Boys and counterprotesters.

So that meant, in 1969, that the preseason games and the first three regular-season games would be played on the road. Then the Miracle Mets of 1969, a team that won the World Series and played till Oct. 16, happened.

Wilfried Zaha was tasked with chasing the ball around, while Jordan Ayew dropped into the midfield line and man-marked Allan, preventing the ball from reaching him.

  From the league's perspective, the phrase "Dez caught it" became common verbiage in the following years for all of the wrong reasons. It was the most notable among many examples of the NFL's rules to complete a catch (or an interception) being too ambiguous.

PORTLAND — Several people in Portland, Ore., were arrested in anti-police brutality protests that continued into early Sunday, hours after demonstrations ended with few reports of violence.
 The protests that began Saturday night were declared an unlawful assembly and police began forcing demonstrators out after objects were thrown at officers, including full drink cans, firecrackers and rocks, police said.
 Hundreds of people had gathered at demonstrations in the downtown area of Oregon’s largest city when the unlawful assembly was announced just before midnight.
 Images showed protesters crowded in and around a park near the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse — the same courthouse that had been the scene of nightly unrest over the summer. A protester was seen burning an American flag.
 Video posted by KOIN-TV showed officers warn that protesters who hurl projectiles will be subject to arrest.
 Several arrests were made, police said, but a specific number was not immediately available. One man broke away from officers and ran two blocks with his hands in zip-tie cuffs before he was recaptured by police. Police also seized bear spray, a baton and a drone in separate stops or arrests.
 Videos also showed police grabbing a news photographer and pushing him to ground, as he was trying to document them tackling and detaining a person on a sidewalk, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Freelance photographer John Rudoff was wearing a helmet with “PRESS” stickers affixed to it. He told the outlet on Sunday that he’s “physically OK but am quite annoyed.”
 Another online video showed an officer apparently deploying a chemical spray in the face of a man who was yelling at police and waving a sign toward them. Police didn’t immediately respond to the Oregonian/OregonLive’s request for comment about either incident.
 The crowd had largely dispersed by early Sunday morning, police said.
 Protesters also marched through Seattle on Saturday, with police reporting 10 arrests, scattered property damage and short-lived fires, the Seattle Times reported.
 The unrest came just hours after a right-wing rally and counterprotesters largely dispersed without serious violence Saturday afternoon. Although, police were investigating an assault after one person who was documenting the event was pushed to the ground and kicked in the face.
 Separately, police said a criminal citation was issued after officials confiscated firearms, paintball guns, baseball bats and shields from a pick-up truck that was initially stopped for having obscured license plates as it left the rally.
 Oregon State Police Superintendent Travis Hampton and Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese praised the minimal violence in a joint statement late Saturday.
 “Our Unified Command worked well to prevent violence before it started,” Hampton said in the statement. “Law enforcement officers performed a number of traffic stops and took weapons off the streets.”
 “On Saturday, Oregonians denounced hate, racism and violence,” Reese stated, adding that, “the Unified Command was able to help keep the peace.”
 Several hundred people, dozens of them wearing militarized body armor, gathered to support President Donald Trump and his “law and order” reelection campaign Saturday afternoon. The attendance was far fewer than the 10,000 organizers had expected after tensions boiled over nationwide following the decision not to charge officers in Louisville, Ky., for killing Breonna Taylor.
 Organized by the Proud Boys, a group that has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the rally was described as a free speech event to support Trump and police and condemn anti-fascists and “violent gangs of rioting felons” in the streets.
 Local and state elected officials condemned the event and rushed to shore up law enforcement ranks as left-wing groups organized several rallies to oppose the Proud Boys’ message. About 1,000 counter-protesters gathered at another park.
 The events began at noon and were largely dispersed by 3 p.m.
 The rally came as Portland has seen nearly nightly protests since the police killing of George Floyd in late May.

Colorado’s pollster emeritus, Floyd Ciruli, remarked recently on the probable accuracy of a surprising poll showing the presidential contest neck-and-neck in the heavily Republican 3rd Congressional District. In this year’s primary and despite a decade in Congress, Republican voters tossed out Scott Tipton for gunslinger Lauren Boebert who campaigned on a promise to prove an even more devoted Trump acolyte than the reliably conservative Tipton. If Western Slope Republicans have finally had a belly full of their president, who won the district handily in 2016, they may not be ready to send a fanatical cheer leader to Washington. Diane Mitsch-Bush could follow in the footsteps of Betsy Markey who represented the bright red Eastern Plains as a one term wonder.
 Our road trip prompted me to call an old friend and city manager, whose name remains better left unmentioned, to check on Colorado’s $200 million, record- setting marijuana bonanza in August. Pot shops in mountain resort communities have prospered since legalization, primarily buoyed by enthusiastic sales to tourists. Five or six years ago, these visitors provided 60-70% of total receipts. This summer there haven’t been all that many out-of-state visitors. Nonetheless, sales are still thriving.
 No more humble-bragging about fleecing tourists — the customers crowding resort pot shops are largely Front Range day trippers escaping COVID-19 lock downs and too many ZOOM meetings. “We can’t explain it entirely,” my insider tells me, “but purchasers aren’t picking up a joint for their afternoon hike. Perhaps they prefer not to be seen parking at their neighborhood store and find it more discreet to replenish their stash here. That’s OK with us, we can use the tax dollars.” Is it possible that homebound boredom has us baking more than sourdough bread?
 I close this recounting of our excursion to the Rockies by noting that nearly everyone is driving too damned fast these days. Yes, my six-month hiatus from the Interstate rat race may have dulled my reflexes, but I’m no shrinking violet behind the wheel (just check with Mrs. Hudson). I set my cruise control eight miles over the limit which usually earns me a pass from speed traps but isn’t nearly fast enough to keep from being passed by everyone else. Frustration? Anger? Risk? Exhilaration? Be careful out there.

We got it on over to Jace (Sternberger) to make that field goal a little bit shorter. We all love Mason (Crosby). He has been a rock for us for so many years. He made some big kicks tonight. The one to take the lead was from 49. It was good to see Jace make a big catch to get us going. We had some really good calls down at the goal line. They were all knifing down in there. It was a beautiful call to fake the inside handoff to the boot to ice it. That was a big call by Matt (LaFleur) and the execution was spot on."

FALL RIVER -- With the eye on the ball to redevelop the city's waterfront, the Fall River Redevelopment Authority has entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Liberty Utilities to purchase two acres of property at 45 Anawan St.
 "One of the functions of the RDA is the urban renewal plan and the waterfront renewal plan and this property falls within the scope of the waterfront plan. And when this opportunity came up it was a natural and that's what we are supposed to be looking for," said RDA Chairman Joseph Marshall.
 The proximity of the land was also attractive being across from the State Pier and next door to the Gates of the City.
 With a sale price of $698,500, the RDA has 60 days to do appropriate testing for land that is likely contaminated.
 "We're not sure of the direction we are going but we are going to be doing a lot of testing to see just what we can put on it," said Marshall. "It could end up being a parking lot because the city needs parking there. If it turns out its contaminated and all we can do is put a cap on it, then that's what we'll do."
 The parcel is identified in the RDA's Waterfront Renewal Plan and is currently used by Liberty Utilities.
 In May, the utility company purchased the former Homeland Builders property on Sykes Road in the Industrial Park for $5.8 million with a plan to make the 72,280-square-foot facility as its home base.
 Mayor Paul Coogan has said publicly that he supports the purchase of the land for future public use.
 Future development of the Anawan Street property would be an addition to the RDA's waterfront redevelopment initiative with an ongoing project to restore the four-acre City Pier into a public way.
 Last month the Seaport Economic Council awarded a $1 million grant to help redevelop the City Pier to add to RDA's pledge to invest another $1.6 million.
 Marshall said work will likely begin in the spring to cap the pier and add walkways, fencing and lighting at the site.

Having surrendered the Premier League title to Liverpool last term by finishing a staggering 18 points behind them, Manchester City will struggle to be title contenders this term if their 5-2 home defeat by Leicester City is anything to go by.
 Manager Pep Guardiola could plausibly claim that City might struggle up front with both strikers Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus out injured against Leicester, but a porous-looking rear guard were in trouble every time the visitors came forward.
 Kyle Walker and Eric Garcia also looked completely at sea as they gave away clumsy penalties won and clinically converted by Jamie Vardy, while City's once intimidating pressure in midfield fell apart as enforcers Rodri and Fernandinho could not cope.
 With the transfer window closing on Oct. 5, City are reportedly close to signing central defender Ruben Dias from Benfica with Guardiola needing reinforcements capable of adding steel to the backbone of his expensively- assembled squad.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — It was June 30, 2019. The Miami Heat had an evening all planned out for their recruitment of free agent Jimmy Butler, down to every detail. They greeted him with music from Irish singer Dermot Kennedy, one of his favorites. A buffet dinner was set up, tables overlooking the water of Biscayne Bay. They had players-turned-executives Shane Battier and Alonzo Mourning there to talk about what it’s like to be part of the Heat.
 And then it was time to go inside, break into a smaller group, get down to business and give him the sales pitch. Butler never let Heat President Pat Riley and coach Erik Spoelstra even get started. There was no need. He’d already picked Miami. He just hadn’t told them yet.
 “I was like, ‘I’m home,’” Butler said.
 The machinations of a sign-and-trade followed before things could be official, but just like that, the Heat had a new star and newfound hope. Season 1 of the Butler era in Miami will end on a stage that he’s never been before — the NBA Finals. The Heat are Eastern Conference champions and play the West champ Los Angeles Lakers in a title series that starts Wednesday night.
 “To be able to get somebody like Jimmy Butler was one of the most amazing recruiting visits we’ve ever had,” Spoelstra said. “Last June, it was so conversational, and you just felt like after 20 minutes that we were so aligned in how we viewed competition and work and culture, everything. We never even got into a pitch with him. We really just had dinner.”
 Butler was Miami’s leading scorer in the regular season, made the All-NBA team and is averaging 20.7 points through the first 15 games of this postseason — 0.2 behind Goran Dragic for the team lead, which couldn’t be of less consequence to Butler. He doesn’t just tell teammates that he doesn’t care about getting credit for things. He demands they claim the credit, want the credit, step up and take big shots.
 “He came in and bought into the system,” said Heat center Bam Adebayo, who led the way in the East-clinching Game 6 win over Boston on Sunday night with 32 points and 14 rebounds. “He didn’t care if he scored. You know, you’ve got to think about that. A lot of max players, they don’t have the ball, they get upset. I appreciate Jimmy because at the end of the day, we feed off each other.”

 After the way he has started this season with goals against Liverpool, Fulham and Sunday's 88th-minute header, those who felt he might only be good enough for the Championship are also having to eat their words.

The governing board of the Preserve at Botany Bay on St. Thomas has started offering a shuttle service to local residents, allowing them to bypass an arduous, mile-long trek to access the beach.
 Senate Majority Leader Marvin Blyden, who helped spearhead the change in Botany Bay’s visitor policy, said the shuttle service represents a “major victory” for the people of the Virgin Islands, particularly those who are elderly or disabled.
 “I am pleased that the board has decided to do the right thing and I hope they continue to in the future,” he said. “We cannot allow the interests of villa guests and tourists to overshadow the importance of beach access for our local people. There are still many changes to be made and discussions to be had, but this is a step in the right direction.”
 Previously, no shuttle was available to the public at Botany Bay and vehicles were not permitted to enter the property. Blyden said this was in violation of the Preserve’s Coastal Zone permit, which stipulates that visitors must have unrestricted access to Botany Bay, Sandy Bay and Mermaid’s Chair.

After Brighton and Crystal Palace lost on Saturday to penalties awarded for handball, the Premier League's stricter approach to the new law came under fire again following Newcastle's late penalty for an incident involving Eric Dier.
 While anger is being directed at the lawmakers IFAB and FIFA, Newcastle manager Steve Bruce, who was critical of the decision which benefited his team, raised the question of whether the Premier League and its referees are not being too zealous in the application of the law and even suggested they ignore the changes.
 "The handball has been around for a hundred years. If it is deliberate, no problem, but it has to be clear and obvious. We have lost the plot with it and it loses the spectacle of it,'' said Bruce.
 "Maybe we can do something about it, we seem to have these phases where we take everything literally in the Premier League and maybe we have to say no to it."

Before the present gym was built, basketball games were played in the John Greer High school building third floor, the former Greer College building. According to Glenn Brasel, the coach hired in 1922, the basketball gym was known as “the cracker box” among athletes.
 “Each evening when the boys reported for practice,’ said Brasel, “we chased out the pigeons, and as soon as practice was over, they came back in to roost for the night.”
 The gym measured 42’ by 30 ‘, out of bounds was the walls and baskets were put on the chimney at one end and a post at the other. Brasel said that “a basketball game played in that gym was more like playing a game of pool. The ball would bounce off the walls all the time just like a banked pool shot.”
 There was also no heat in “the cracker box.” Temperatures would usually be between 45-50 degrees, according to Brasel in an interview when he retired, “and the next year no teams would come to Hoopeston to play basketball.” Brasel’s teams played all basketball games out of town until the new John Greer gym was opened in 1928. The first game played in the new gym was December 1928 against East Lynn.
 And, I finally know what year, now that Honeywell is losing its existence, the Honeywell Football Field was built as a football field. It was created in 1939 with the help of the WPA who was doing roadwork in Hoopeston that year. That was Honeywell’s final piece of history that I needed.
 The Honeywell playground equipment was shifted to John Greer Grade School and will become a part of that school.

US casino owner Caesars has said it is in “advanced discussions” to buy gambling firm William Hill for around £2.9 billion.
 Last week, William Hill told investors it had received takeover approaches from Caesars and private equity giant Apollo.
 Caesars said the board of directors at William Hill have indicated the offer is at a level that “they would be minded to recommend to shareholders”.
 The US firm said the offer would be 272p for each William Hill share, representing a 25% premium on Thursday’s closing share price of 217.6p.
 William Hill's sports betting expertise will complement Caesars' current offering
 However, shares in William Hill surged to 312.2p at the close of play on Friday on the back of the takeover speculation.
 Caesars said it has completed due diligence and would expect any deal to be completed in the second half of 2021.

Chelsea travelled to West Bromwich Albion expecting three points to keep up with the Premier League pacesetters but found themselves three goals down after an early defensive collapse.
 Chelsea fought back to grab a 3-3 draw but all three of West Brom's goals resulted from glaring defensive errors and, with their new Brazil defender Thiago Silva at fault for the second goal on his league debut, Lampard will have plenty on his mind.
 Marcos Alonso and Silva were guilty of being careless on the ball and Kyle Bartley was left unmarked to score, suggesting there are issues of concentration that need to be dealt with.
 Chelsea's attacking talents appear to be gelling but unless they get to grips with their defensive frailties, the Blues could quickly find themselves among the league's also-rans.

"We have had some good teams over the years. I remember the 2014 offense where we were scoring 20+ points in every first half. I wasn't playing a bunch of fourth quarters that year because we were lighting up the scoreboard. In 2011, we had a really good offense and put up some amazing numbers. This offense is so different. We were missing Davante (Adams). I think a lot of teams look at us and see that we don't have many stars to be worried about. Aaron Jones is a talented guy and you have to try to take him away. You never know whose day it's going to be. Week one was Davante. Week two was a number of other guys. Aaron Jones had a big one. Today it was kind of all over the place. It wasn't an explosion of offense, but the efficiency was really, really good. We went four for five in the red zone. Big Dog's play on the sideline was huge. The first touchdown to Allen was a great play call. There was so much stress on the defense with guys flying and sliding and coming back on the other side. I feel so much more comfortable in the offense this year. I think Matt has settled into the rhythm of the play calling and has made my job a lot easier. I've gotten sacked twice in three games. Tonight was probably my fault by not adjusting to protection. The offensive line has blocked extremely well."

This Mercedes is easy on the eyes, with a perky backside and smiling front end. For 2020, it has received several design tweaks including a new grille, an enhanced lower rear fascia and slimmer headlights for a slightly more menacing appearance. Black-finish quad exhaust tips and optional ($200) 20-inch wheels accentuate my tester's generally tasteful appearance. But that drooping lid is still a head-scratcher -- if not a head- _basher_ \-- to me. To be fair, Mercedes-Benz is far from the only automaker doing this. The GLC Coupe has several soggy-top rivals including the BMW X4, Porsche Cayenne Coupe and upcoming Infiniti QX55.
 Despite its collapsed profile, this version of the GLC is still pretty spacious inside -- cargo capacity hasn't been as savaged by that roofline as you might expect. The coupe offers around 17.7 cubic feet of room behind the rear seats and about 49.4 with the backrests folded. The standard GLC43 SUV is only slightly more spacious, offering 19.4 cubes behind the rear seats and 56.5 with them upright.

Ja Nelle Pleasure never used to think twice about putting food on the table for her family.


  In fact, the Pleasure family revolved __ around food. One of their favorite activities was to spin a globe, put a finger down and cook a dish from the country where it lands.


  "It was a lot of fun because we got to eat all over the place, stuff that none of us would have dared try before, like silkworms," she says. "They really look disgusting and scary. ... But when you eat it, it tastes like popcorn."


  They haven't done that since the start of the pandemic, when Pleasure lost her job.


  "There's not a belt to tighten there. There's no wiggle room here," she says. "I'm unemployed, and there are limited things that I can do."


  This is increasingly becoming the reality for millions of Americans, and people of color are much worse off. According to July data from the Census Bureau, nearly 25% of white families with children reported struggling to afford food. Meanwhile, nearly 40% of Black families with children reported food insecurity. Those numbers are more than double what they were before the pandemic.

"Pension Obligation Bonds" or "Lease Revenue Bonds" are just the latest innovation of government to obfuscate and confuse the public into thinking they are on top of an issue, but in reality, are intended to screw us with complexity. Simplicity, or KISS (keep it simple stupid) should be the order of the day. It's all, part and parcel, with solving, or rather not, problems by introducing complicated, self serving layers to permit them to get away with murder. When the problem can be boiled down to have the "public servant" pay his "fair" share by taking a truly realistic pay cut and pay their own way, we are told bargaining is not doable. The California Rule prevents a loss of bargained for compensation at the risk of fiscal bankruptcy!

"[Mitchell] did very well. Rodriguez is obviously a player that we were aware what he's capable of doing. Between [Mitchell] and the midfield players, they kept James reasonably quiet.
 "Certainly on the ball, he was as good as he's been in this season's games. Once again, his game is being kept at a very high level.
 "We are hoping that with every game he plays and the experience that gives that it makes him that little bit better. We are delighted with him, and I was delighted with him again today."
 It was not all one-way traffic, however. Rodriguez played a clever pass in behind Mitchell for Seamus Coleman to set up the opening goal for Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
 But all the same, it's a great start for a 21-year-old making his name among fans of his own team, let alone the Premier League and beyond.
 And for Hodgson, Mitchell's performances have been a welcome boon as the defence suffers a deluge of injuries. Van Aanholt's injury should have disrupted Palace hugely - a player who is extremely influential both in defence and going forward.

You may know someone who promises to do the work under the table for cheap, but working with a renovator who does not adhere to the highest standards could cost you more in the end. For instance, if a renovator does not provide a written contract, what recourse do you have if some of the work doesn't get done? And if a renovator is not adequately insured, who will pay in case of property damage?

Il driver di Campobasso ha staccato un ottimo 140.03 nella terza manche che lo vede comunque soddisfatto in ottica campionato sebbene sia stato un weekend dal rendimento non entusiasmante dato che non è riuscito a trovare il giusto setup mentre la concorrenza era sempre più agguerrita.

This was hardly a drive for answering critics. There was no real battle with Hamilton, the man who he is struggling to beat. His qualifying performance was by far his worst of the season, all considered, nearly 0.7s away from the quickest time and after Hamilton had one of his messiest sessions. On Sunday, once the 10-second time penalty was confirmed, all Bottas had to do was keep his black car on the black stuff. Max Verstappen did not have the pace in the Red Bull to trouble him.

A Constitution for a country is in the final analysis a constitution for the entire political community within a country. Although the basic nature of that constitution may be conceptualized by a ruling party, to be sustainable and be able to survive post-regime change shocks, it should not reflect only the agenda of that ruling party or an individual leader. Experience in Sri Lanka as well as other countries shows that such constitutions have been the first step to despotism in some form.
