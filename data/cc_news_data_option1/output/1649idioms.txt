Zicuis has been arrested multiple times in Pinellas County, Florida, according to online court records. In 2003, she was cited for driving without a valid license and for failing to have headlights turned on.
 In January 2004, Zicuis was arrested and charged for battery against a law enforcement officer. Court records show she originally entered a "not guilty" plea and was ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation. Zicuis changed her plea at least three times before the case was resolved with a "no contest" plea.
 The case did not go to trial due to an "order of incompetence," records show. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Zicuis was sentenced to more than 21 months behind bars in September 2005. But she appears to have received credit for time served because she was released on November 10, 2005.

Scientists are working on a three-month timeline for a Covid-19 antigen test.


  A consortium of researchers which is striving to develop a test which can accurately identify which people have had the disease is working to a three- month timescale to have a test ready for mass production.


  It comes after a team at Oxford University identified an antigen that is being used as “the basis of the test”, said Dr Mario Gualano, chief executive of BBI Solutions, which is part of the consortium.

"The difficulties are starting to become obvious as clearly different leagues have different capabilities.
 "The Premier League can probably play behind closed doors, they can probably work out some kind of TV deal and do it so all their players are tested.
 "That's going to become more and more difficult the further down the leagues you go.
 "We wouldn't be able to test our players unless you have some sort of nationwide testing programme."
 He says that beside the obvious differences in income, there is the community aspect of non-league football that needs to be considered.
 "In terms of playing behind closed doors we could probably do it - if you have 280 people at a game we could keep them two metres apart," he said.
 "For a lot of people in non-league football it's more about the community aspect, it's about meeting the same people and having a chat with them.

"When can we start pre-season? Will we be starting at a normal time?
 "Some have suggested cancelling the FA Cup to help align things. That's seems great if you're an Everton fan and it's a bit of a distraction.
 "It's not so great if you're a club that relies on the income the FA Cup brings in to stay afloat."
 He added that the players must be looked after before any return is finalised.
 "It's great they are talking about getting professional football back, many of my players will want to play football as well, they'll be getting cabin fever," he said.
 "On the other hand though some of my other players will be thinking they're not sure about wanting it to start again - if they've got loved ones who are key workers or vulnerable.
 "At the end of the day we are very conscious there's a public health crisis and that takes precidence."

Christina Zicuis and the male victim were arguing about her deceased daughter, according to the arrest report, around 5 a.m. on April 25. The Clearwater Police department explained Zicuis was accused of stabbing the victim in the left arm using a pen, "which caused it to break skin."
 The victim then tried to leave the house. Zicuis followed him into the front yard armed with a brick, police said. She threw the brick at the victim but missed. The brick landed in the middle of the road and shattered into several pieces. The affidavit goes on, "Christina then threw a candy cane at the victim's left arm, causing bruising and swelling to his elbow."
 The officer listed "Candy" as the "weapon type" on the arrest report. The responding officer noted Zicuis did not appear to be under the influence of any drugs or alcohol at the time of the arrest.

“I’m always willing to go the extra mile, do what I need to do, meeting extra, all that stuff,” Glasgow told reporters in a conference call when asked about the characterizations. “In terms of not fearing anything … in the context of football, whatever a team asks me to do, I’m going to try to do. I’m not going to shy away from that. Whatever the Colts ask me to do when I come in as I go through my process with them, I’ll have no fear taking that on.”  
 Glasgow has been told he’ll start out in the linebacker room, though he’ll undoubtedly have a big role on special teams, as well. He was a stalwart in that area at Michigan, and he’ll need to play well there to enjoy a long NFL career.
 But there are other possibilities, too, including a hybrid safety type. He’s faster than people realize and has great instincts in coverage, one of the things the Colts liked about him.
 “A lot of teams looking to go to faster people, a little more versatility in coverage and the run game,” Glasgow said. “The key is just because you’re smaller, you can’t trade off in the run game and not be able to handle the many things an offense teams can throw at you. I don’t know what the Colts think of me and my ability as a three-down linebacker, but I feel like I have the ability to develop into a strong defensive player going forward.”
 Many other teams thought so, too. Though Glasgow wasn’t invited to the NFL Combine, several teams gave him positive reviews.
 “I thought I was going to go late in the sixth, so I went around where I thought I would have gone if I got drafted,” he said. “I saw a lot of people picked before me … it got me excited and fired up to see who got picked before me. They may have been better than me in college, but what matters is the work you put in going forward.
 “A lot of teams say it doesn’t matter where you’re drafted; you’ll have an equal opportunity to compete with someone drafted in the first, second, third or fourth round. Even if that’s not necessarily true and there’s some preconceived notion … I’m used to that preconceived notion (as a walk-on). Early in my college career, I was used to going through it, used to changing people’s minds about me. If someone has a bad opinion about me, look forward to changing that.”
 He’s done it his entire life, after all, having to prove himself behind two older (and much bigger) brothers in NFLers Ryan and Graham. He’s ready to show the world again just who he is, on the biggest stage of all.
