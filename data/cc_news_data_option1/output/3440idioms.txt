After the death of actor Chadwick Boseman was announced late Friday, people were left to think about the lasting impact his influential roles had on those within the Black community.
 Boseman was known most notably for his role as King T’Challa in 2018’s hit Marvel movie "Black Panther," but this was not the sole moment in his career in which he portrayed a Black hero.
 Boseman portrayed Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in Major League Baseball, in “42” in 2013, musician James Brown in the biopic “Get on Up” in 2014 and NAACP lawyer and later Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in “Marshall” in 2017.
 These roles were especially significant for Black MU students such as Timothy Boykin, a senior from Kansas City studying performance and arts with an emphasis in acting.
 Boykin said that when he first saw someone had tweeted a tribute to Boseman, he figured maybe it was the actor’s birthday. He said he never would have guessed Boseman had died of colon cancer at age 43.
 Boykin said Boseman’s spirit and his career inspired him as a man and as an actor.
 "As a man it taught me how to be masculine, but in a good way — not being toxic," Boykin said. "As an actor, it taught me that I can achieve all of my dreams with the right attitude, on camera and off of the camera."
 Boseman’s career showed the importance of having representation in media, especially given that "Black Panther" was so well received by a range of demographics.
 Alexis Hunter, a senior in education from Flossmoor, Illinois, spoke about how much the film inspired young Black youth.
 "From an educational perspective, it gives a different lens on what African culture looks like," Hunter said. "'Black Panther' allows Black people to see themselves in a more empowering way. It allows them to see that they’re not just one thing; they’re multifaceted. We don’t just have to talk about slavery when we talk about Black lives."
 By portraying influential people, Boseman reassured Black kids who were aspiring to be something, whether in acting or some other field.
 Phajja Redwood, a senior from Kansas City studying theater and psychology, expressed how great it felt to see someone who looked like her on the big screen.
 “It literally gives me hope," Redwood said. "I cannot be more excited or enthusiastic or enthused about seeing Black people in Black roles, because that’s what we need. We need more of us in these places and these roles so we can talk to people and express what’s really going on in different ways."
 Even people who were not avid watchers of all of Boseman’s films still felt his loss. This rings true for Ty-Ron Douglas, an associate professor in the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis in the College of Education.
 “We feel like we know these people,” Douglas said of celebrities who touch our lives. “I feel like sometimes we’re reminded that they’re human. It reminds us of some of the pain and some of the challenges that we overcome as fellow humans.”
 It's essential to have icons like Boseman to look to in spaces where people don’t always feel well-represented, Douglas said.
 “For many folks, especially in a country like this or on a campus like Mizzou’s, that’s not their lived experience," he said. "The notion of a Wakanda was powerful because it allowed us to imagine Black excellence and Black excellence being the pervasive lived landscape, and it was affirming.”

C’est une longue histoire de désamour qui remonte à la fin des années 80. Après l’attaque frontale de N.W.A sur l’explicite « Fuck Tha Police », la relation entre le rap et le Los Angeles Police Department a pris différents tours. La scène rap californienne a d’abord fait la critique acerbe d’une institution harcelante, raciste et corrompue, soit via le brûlot acerbe et ultraviolent (Cypress Hill, qui ouvre son premier album avec « Pigs »), soit par divers moyens de mise en scène (N.W.A, encore eux, qui racontent une course-poursuite avec les flics dans « 100 Miles and Runnin’ »). Après le passage à tabac de Rodney King par la police et l’acquittement de ses agresseurs, qui précède aux émeutes de Los Angeles en 1992, la dissension va supplanter la critique. _The Predator_ , troisième album d’Ice Cube sorti la même année, en est le meilleur exemple. Imprégné du drame, il dresse un état des lieux accablant et la violence de morceaux tels que « We Had to Tear this Motherfucker Up », dédié aux assaillants, est palpable. Depuis ce sommet de virulence, l’incompréhension demeure et la police de Los Angeles est soit invectivée (« Hands Up » de Vince Staples), gentiment taclée (« _Still not loving police_ » dans « Still DRE ») ou prise à partie dans le problème plus large de la discrimination raciale aux États-Unis (« Alright » de Kendrick Lamar). En 2016, après la tuerie de Dallas qui répondait aux meurtres d’Anton Sterling et de Philando Castille par les forces de l’ordre, The Game et Snoop Dog initient un effort de paix et engagent le dialogue via une marche pacifique jusqu’aux locaux du LAPD. Mais les textes de YG « Police Get Away with Murder » et surtout « FTP », qui fait suite à l'assassinat de George Floyd en mai 2020, nous rappellent finalement à une monstrueuse vérité : depuis plus de trente ans, rien n’a changé. - _David²_

Female doctors in Canada consistently earn less than their male colleagues because of systemic biases that pervade the medical profession, a new analysis suggests.
 An article published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests that female doctors are underrepresented in top-earning medical specialities and paid less for equivalent work because of structural inequities that follow them throughout their career.
 "Our analysis piece confirms that the gender pay gap exists in Canadian medicine," said Tara Kiran, a family physician and clinician investigator at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.
 "That pay gap exists both within every medical specialty and also between specialties."
 Kiran and co-author Dr. Michelle Cohen of Queen's University used publicly available data to examine the relationship between the proportion of women in a specialty and average earnings across Canada.
 They found that women account for less than 35 per cent of doctors in the 10 specialities with the highest incomes, including radiology, ophthalmology and cardiology.
 By contrast, female doctors made up roughly half or more of the workforce in lower-paying specialities, such as family medicine, psychiatry and pediatrics.
 Female doctors also earn less on average than their male counterparts within the same field, the authors noted.
 According to an analysis of data from the Ontario Medical Association, men in family medicine make 30 per cent more than women, while the gender discrepancy for specialists was 40 per cent.
 Kiran said it's a common misconception that women in medicine earn less because they work less.
 While the data suggests that female doctors work slightly fewer hours a week, particularly during their childbearing years, the difference over the course of their careers isn't enough to account for the pay gap, said Kiran.
 Rather, she said, the disparity in earnings is a result of conscious and unconscious biases that systemically devalue women's work.
 Kiran said the issues start as early as medical school, where women encounter a "hidden curriculum" that points many toward lower-paid specialties. She said there's also some research indicating that as the proportion of women in a specialty grows, its relative income declines, giving rise to a "pink-collar" tier of medicine.
 She said the problems persist through the hiring process, which is often facilitated by informal male networks. These power structures often perpetuate themselves by giving men a leg up in rising through the ranks to leadership positions, she said.

 Even after seven decades of Lebanese independence, France still wields strong influence on the tiny Mediterranean nation.
 Two days after the port blast — with Lebanese leaders totally absent — Macron visited Beirut and toured one of the most heavily damaged neighborhoods to a hero’s welcome, with some chanting “Vive La France.”
 More than 60,000 signed a petition to place Lebanon under French mandate for 10 years, an idea Macron firmly dismissed. “It’s up to you to write your history,” he told the crowds.
 On his return trip, Macron will plant a tree in Beirut on Tuesday to mark the centenary and meet with Lebanese officials to push them toward forming a government and enacting reforms.
 “There is no doubt we were expecting the 100th anniversary to be different. We did not expect this year to be catastrophic to this level,” said Najjar, who is a lawyer, poet and author of about 30 books in French, including one that tells the story of Beirut during the 20th Century.

LAKEVILLE -- The restaurant industry has faced many hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic, with mass closures and millions of layoffs.
 Many eateries have been learning how to adapt to the new regulations. Amiee and Brent Clark, owners of Clark's Catering, are among the businesses trying to pivot in a new direction in order to stay afloat.
 While some restaurants have responded with makeshift outdoor seating and continued offering take out, Clark's Catering opened a food truck located outside of Muckey's Liquor Store in Lakeville.
 "We have owned the catering company for three years, and obviously with the pandemic we kind of had no choice but to go a different direction," Brent said. "It was either: Do we adapt? Do we change the direction that we're going? Or do we sit back and lose everything we gained from the first two years?"
 Despite events being canceled and large social gatherings banned during the beginning of the pandemic, the Clarks weren't about to let all their hard work go to waste.
 "We just took every last penny that we had and rolled it into this to make it work," Brent explained, and their investment has paid off.
 Customers have been lining up to try their home cooked meals with locally sourced ingredients.
 Clark says that food trucks build communities for the cooks, employees, customers, and everyone involved. And they're seeing that unfold at their easy-to-find spot on Route 44 in a far corner of the parking lot at the longtime local landmark, Muckey's.
 "We even have regulars now," Brent says.
 The Clarks and their team have worked hard to create a welcoming atmosphere that serves great food, and now that many local businesses are starting to reopen, so are the events, which means Brent and Amiee and their staff will be balancing their time between working in the food truck and catering parties. Monday through Thursday, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., the truck can be found outside the liquor store, while the weekends are reserved for catering.
 And in an unexpected twist, the food truck has given Clark's the freedom to travel to many different locations to cater events and serve the food that they love to cook.
 "I've always been in the restaurant business," Brent states. "I love food and I get excited when there are options for me to give them [customers]."
 Their Facebook page and website have menus with endless options to choose from, but that isn't all they offer.
 "For catering we do all custom menus. We do have menus online but it's a guideline. It's basically, 'what do you guys want to eat? What kind of party are you having? Is there a theme? Is there a budget?' We try to work with everybody…"
 Brent says, "As of now, yes," outside of Muckey's is a permanent location. "You know, we'd love to stay here as long as possible. Our end goal is to have an actual restaurant. But this is our start."

Jeg må sige, at jeg egentlig er ret glad for konceptet og æstetikken som Yune arbejder med i eksempelvis musikvideoen til singlen "Odd One Out", der skifter mellem grynede, solsprængte og sandslebent skarpe videoklip. Lidt af den samme stil blev ført over til det store lærred bag dem i Empire, hvor forskellige ørkenbilleder forvrængedes i en sådan grad at jeg til tider blev i tvivl om det var vand eller sand på skærmen, hvilket udgjorde et fint udgangspunkt for musikken. I min anmeldelse af _Agog_ beskrev jeg den repetition og monotoni, der lader til at være en del af pladens koncept, og hvor den på studieindspilningen til dels fungerer som en meditativ rygrad, bliver det i liveudgaverne desværre en hæmsko, og ærligt talt en kende kedeligt.

Six years ago Jim Garman gave his wife, Michelle, a beehive for Christmas to cure her fear of bees. As it turns out, his cheeky gift delivered. What's more, it sparked a passion for the spunky, Newport-based couple that continues to this day.
 "This year, we have nine hives," says Michelle, who runs an 8-acre sustainable farm with Jim in Middletown. "Every year, we get a few more. It's one of those things that you get addicted to and keep growing, growing, growing if you have the space."
 As Tiverton resident Susan Medyn can attest, you don't have to own a farm to keep bees. At current count, she manages 16 hives -- nine in her 1-acre backyard a stone's throw from the Sakonnet River, and seven more at another property nearby.
 She speaks thoughtfully about her seven summers as an amateur beekeeper. Like the Garmans, her passion grew out of a self-imposed challenge.
 "In 2011, I was diagnosed with a nasty form of breast cancer," Medyn explains. "It involved a lot of treatment in chemo and radiation. Afterward, I thought I would do something that would really challenge me. I didn't feel like skydiving was my thing -- I didn't want a one-time thrill. Beekeeping was something that felt possible and, for me, something that felt intimidating."
 Tending to her buzzing flock quickly monopolized Medyn's free time -- not that she has a lot of it. She works as both a clinical social worker and a successful artist.
 She started out with just two hives, but even that proved daunting. "My first week was fraught with unusual experiences. It was really difficult to know what to do," she says. "I installed the bees, and they swarmed two days later. Not having equipment, I put them back in the hive. Of course, swarming means they need another hive, so they swarmed again. Within two more days, there was another swarm from the other hive. All my neighbors were thinking, 'What is she doing?'"
 Medyn and the Garmans aren't the only ones in Newport County feeling the buzz. Whether it's to tune out technology or get back to nature, more and more people are experimenting with backyard beehives.
 Newport resident and bee expert Ed Karle, who owns and runs a training, mentoring and onsite hive support service called Beeviews, says, "There has definitely been an increase in interest and in getting honeybees, across the country, in all states and towns. On average, there are four or more beekeepers of various scales in every town in the U.S. When I started teaching beekeeping in 2008, my bee class had 12 people. Now, the numbers are always over 100."
 When it comes to apiculture, Karle's reach is extensive, stretching into greater Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He teaches classes in beekeeping at Bristol Community College, where he's an adjunct professor, as well as through the Bee School offered by the Rhode Island Beekeepers Association (RIBA) at Rhode Island College.
 "It's very important to go to a beekeeping school offered by a state or county organization," Karle says. "The instructors are local, experienced beekeepers and their knowledge is critical to starting the hobby on a good foundation. Besides taking a formal beekeeping class, new beekeepers should also get a local mentor who can [provide] support."
 Jim Garman agrees that beginners should start to build a knowledge base before jumping in. "RIBA offers a really excellent class that happens in January or February," he says. "I would definitely not recommend just taking this up without even a modicum of learning."
 Adds Michelle, "In addition to taking the class, find some kind of mentor who has been doing this forever and has seen every issue they could possibly see. They can come out and walk you through what's going on with your hive. That's been an invaluable tool."
 Medyn says that by her fifth year with hives she felt like she had just reached kindergarten. "I moved forward, learning more and taking classes, learning more and going to conferences, learning more, reading, asking for help." She currently belongs to three organizations and frequents beekeeping meetings. She also still touches base with her mentor, who happens to be Karle.
 Although the initial time investment in learning can be steep, Karle says that beekeepers only spend about 20 hours total tending to their hives over the course of a full year, and bees are really only active March through December. "Honeybees do not love to see their beekeeper visit and do inspections. Beekeeping is not like a human-dog relationship. What beekeepers need to do is visit their hives for specific reasons or tasks at the right times of the year with the right tools."
 But if you ask Medyn, she'll tell you the experience can be a bit more intensive. "It's time-consuming and involved -- a tremendous amount of work," she says. "It involves trying to anticipate and assess what you're seeing, and to do the proper actions. It can take hours on a beautiful Saturday. But I just love to see what's going on in there."
 If you've got the time and energy to devote and would like to become an apiarist, expect to invest about $600 during the first season. That covers personal gear, a bee kit with bees, hive parts, and annual consumables like sugar and honey bottling supplies.
 One thing you don't necessarily need is a lot of space. To avoid getting stung -- or having your neighbors get stung -- you'll just want to locate your hive in an easy-to-get-to spot that's not in the way of doors, pathways or outdoor activities. You also need sunlight. "It wakes them up," explains Karle. "Bees use the sun to navigate to and from forage sources. The earlier the direct sun, the better."
 Newport County offers a pretty nice environment for beekeeping. "There's a lot of undeveloped land, which allows bees to have a variety of forage," Medyn says. "We're so fortunate that it's not monoculture crop-based or something where there's more challenges. The biggest challenge would be if a farmer or lawn care company didn't abide by appropriate use of pesticides."
 Because of this, honeybees in Newport County are pretty happy -- and happy honeybees don't hang around looking to dive bomb humans. Honeybees typically forage over a three-mile radius from the hive (about 25 square miles) looking for pollen, nectar and water.
 "If the bees are well managed, then they're usually pretty calm," Jim Garman says. "It's generally during the requeening process that you run into trouble."
 Adds Michelle, "The only other time you'd maybe see an aggressive hive would be at night, if raccoons or something else is bothering them, and the bees are super-defensive and alert."
 Keeping bees has not only been a wonderful experience for Medyn and the Garmans, but it has enriched other areas of their lives. For Medyn, it has inspired and informed her artwork in a few ways. "A lot of the work since I've had bees [depicts] bits of honeycomb and bees flying around," she says.
 Medyn also paints her actual hives, using a technique from her Polish heritage. It's the traditional Eastern European process of painting intricate designs on Easter eggs. "This enables me to have hives that are appealing to me," she says. "Also, bees prefer to have a way to identify their own hive. Bees will drift into other hives if, say, they're all white and in a line. They recognize the different colors and patterns on the hive that they should go to."
 Most local beekeepers harvest honey to give as gifts or eat themselves. Others with large hives, like the Garmans and Medyn, sell it. To try out their brands of Newport County honey, look for Medyn's at Coastal Roasters in Tiverton, and the Garmans' through The Green Grocer in Portsmouth, A Market on Bellevue in Newport, and the Jamestown Farmers Market.

MARSHFIELD -- Horse racing, which became a major event at the Marshfield Fair shortly after World War II, is long gone, but for many, the memories of the thundering herd pounding around the half-mile bullring track linger. They always seem to surface at this time of year.
 "I had an uncle who came down from Boston on the weekends of the fair and he loved to play the ponies," said Bill Frugoli, 88, who went to the fair when he was a child.
 Frugoli, auditor for the Marshfield Agricultural and Horticultural Society, the nonprofit that operates the fair, has many warm memories of days spent in the grandstand watching the races with his uncle.
 "He always bet on the gray horses," Frugoli said, laughing as he remembers how overwhelmed the man was when, during one race, every horse was gray.
 Be it horses, Model-A Fords, or Brockton-built Marsh and Metz motorcycles, racing was a fixture in Marshfield since the fair opened in 1867. In 1912, Thomas Lawson built a track and grandstand. In 1934, pari-mutuelgambling was legalized in the state and it was off to the races.
 Even though he was too young to gamble, Frugoli and his friends would always find a sympathetic adult to place a bet for them.
 "We never won big money," he said. "We might have won 20 cents in the end."
 The fair's 10-day mid-August meet was a loosely run operation, a sort of mom- and-pop affair. Frugoli said horses that lost were often given away at the end of the meet. One man even "claimed a few" for his daughter.
 "I was a little tyke, but I remember being able to go horseback riding on one of those horses," he said. "The story that went around was, don't ring a bell when you're riding or it'll take off."
 Carleton Chandler, longtime secretary of the fair, said horse racing in Marshfield was part of a circuit with the other fairs in Massachusetts, including Weymouth, Brockton, Great Barrington and Northampton.
 "It was a whole different crowd," Chandler said. "In Marshfield, it was great, you had people come down from Boston, the metro area, and rent houses for the week or two weeks of the fair and bring the whole family down. It was like a vacation for them."
 Kids would hit the midway while the grownups tried their luck at the betting window.
 The fair runs in the Chandler family's blood. Carleton's father, Russell, moved to Marshfield in 1938 and became the fairgrounds' announcer the next year, using equipment from his radio shop. He was perhaps best-known for calling the horse races from the infield, a duty he took on in 1961 and kept for 26 years. Carleton Chandler worked alongside his father and others to orchestrate the event.
 Lenny LaForest, a retired Marshfield police sergeant and president of the Marshfield Agricultural and Horticultural Society, first started working at the fair in the late 1950s. He swept floors that were littered with losing betting slips, and worked the beer stand alongside Chandler.
 "People still tell me, 'I remember going to see the horses,'" he said.
 One particular Sunday is etched in LaForest's memory. Trotters were coming around the first turn and one horse bumped into another as the jockey was holding the reins in the sulky, a two-wheeled cart.
 "All of the sudden, the horse and the jockey and the carriage are all over the inside rail," he said. "The horse was spooked."
 Cars were all parked on the infield oval surrounded by the track.
 "The horse and the carriage went down through all the cars, just bouncing through," LaForest said. "They must have gotten two-thirds of the way through when the horse went upside-down between a couple of cars. The best part about it was they got the horse out. The horse was fine, and the carriage was a little worse for wear. The jockey was fine too."
 To many who grew up on the South Shore, horse racing at the Marshfield Fair marked the end of the summer. It was the place to gather to have one last blast before fall set in and the kids went back to school.
 The Marshfield races had history and personality. Photo-finish prints, fastened to a wire, were sent past the heads of bettors from the top of the grandstand to the steward's stand on the opposite side of the track. The jockeys and the trainers at Marshfield were either youngsters on their way up or veterans on their way down. After a race, the jockeys had to walk through a crowd of race fans who critiqued their ride in colorful language.
 Racing ended at Marshfield in 1991 after a conflict with the newly opened track in Foxborough. The state racing commission awarded Marshfield's dates to Foxborough and moved Marshfield's meet back two weeks. Such a move would have been a potential killer for Marshfield because the fair would have found it hard to survive with the kids back in school. The result was a fatal blow to racing at Marshfield.
 Losing horse racing's seven hours of daily entertainment forced Marshfield Fair to reinvent itself. Instead of a 10-race card each day, it now features demolition derbies, stunt shows, brightly colored midway games, thrilling carnival rides, agricultural exhibits, 4-H shows, rodeo events and a blues music festival. The fair typically draws about 150,000 people over 10 days to its grounds off Route 3A. However, this year's Marshfield Fair has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We've been able to transform ourselves," Chandler said. "With our strong agriculture presence, it's worked out very good for us. That part has been very positive."
 Between the stables, track, grandstand and jockey area, the infrastructure required to pull off the sport of kings took up half of the space on the fairgrounds, Chandler said.
 Now that the fair has regained all that acreage, Chandler said he isn't sure what he would do without it.
 "Now looking back, I wonder how we put the fair on when we didn't have any of this room," Chandler said.

Note 20's plastic backing feels cheaper, but lighter
 One major -- and very obvious -- difference between the Note 20 Ultra and standard Note 20 is the backing. You get Gorilla Glass Victus on the back of the Note 20 Ultra and a polycarbonate (that means plastic) backing on the Note 20. This may not seem like a big deal, but Samsung and other high-end smartphone makers are perhaps victims of their own success, training consumers that glass is classy and sophisticated, while plastic, a typically less shatter-prone material, is now seen as less refined.
 Samsung sent along my first choice Note 20 finish, the mystic green color, which is a beautiful, shimmery, green with blue undertones in the right light. It looks downright satiny. However, $1,000 still seems like a lot to pay for a phone with a plastic backing, even when you slap on a case. Side by side with the Note 20 Ultra, the Note 20 looks and feels midrange, which doesn't line up with the asking price.
