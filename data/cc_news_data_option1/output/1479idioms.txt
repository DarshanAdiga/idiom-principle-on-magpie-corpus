Dear Dave,   I own a small company, and we lease the building we operate from. As an entrepreneur, how do you know when it is time to stop leasing and buy a place of your own?   Peter
 Dear Peter,   You should only buy a building when you have a solid track record of success, and a really good idea of what your building needs will be. A growing business is always a good thing, but you don't want to focus too much on real estate and not enough on generating revenue and managing that growth intelligently. You would also want to make sure you're going to be in anything you buy for a good, long while.
 I'm a big fan of leasing the first few years after starting your own business. It's even better if you can work out of your home, but I understand that's not always practical. Down the road, you can choose to lease with an option to buy, or, in the right situation, just buy a building.
 Remember, make sure you do it all with cash. Don't add debt to the equation!   Dave
 Is it ever too late?   Dear Dave,   Life insurance is one of those things I always said I would get around to buying someday, but, for various reasons, I just haven't done it yet. Is there ever a time when it is too late to get life insurance?   Angie
 Dear Angie,   First of all, I only recommend level term life insurance. It's fairly easy to get until around age 70, depending on your overall health situation. Once you get into your seventies and beyond, however, it can be more difficult to find reasonably priced coverage.
 I recommend that most people have 10 to 12 times their annual income in term life insurance. To be honest, though, you really shouldn't need life insurance if you're 70 or older. At that point, if you've saved and invested wisely over the years, you can be self-insured. By this, I mean you've got enough money in savings and investments to cover funeral expenses - plus enough for a spouse to live on comfortably after you're gone.
 Don't wait any longer, Angie. Take care of this today!   Dave

One problem is that postponements, rather than cancellations, are leaving ticketholders out of pocket. Ticketmaster quietly changed its terms last week so that it would only deem cancelled events eligible for refunds. And even if rearranged festivals take place, there will be logistical difficulties for artists, vendors and fans. New dates in late August and early September for Primavera Sound in Barcelona, NOS Primavera in Porto and Kala in Albania are now wedged into the same time already occupied by – in the UK alone – End of the Road, Reading and Leeds, Lost Village and Notting Hill carnival, not to mention countless smaller promoters who hope to juice whatever they can from a summer in suspension.

But that would be just the tip of the iceberg. The plan borrows liberally from Inlsee’s climate plan and Elizabeth Warren’s Blue New Deal (some of Inslee’s advisors went on to work on the Warren campaign and the Blue New Deal in particular). I won’t recap all the hits in here from his seven-part series of plans, but suffice to say, what AOC dubbed the “gold standard” of presidential climate plans is well represented, though Inslee himself had no role in drafting this plan since [gestures wildly at the state of the world].

A planet that transitions from a healthy source of natural resources to a bruised limp shell of its former self is potentially much more deadly than coronavirus, which is merely one more example of an abrupt happenstance (Black Swan) that nobody expected, as it happened all of a sudden, out of the blue.

Vancouver Whitecaps regained pole position in the Western Conference, while Sporting Kansas City snapped their losing run with a 0-0 draw at Portland Timbers.
 Two of the Whitecaps' leading forwards struck in a four-minute blitz from Vancouver as they accounted for Colorado Rapids 2-0 on Wednesday, with Carl Robinson's men leapfrogging LA Galaxy into first position in the West's standings.
 The win took the Whitecaps to 48 points, two ahead of the Galaxy, who host Montreal Impact on Saturday.
 Meanwhile, Sporting (43) moved up to fourth, just one point behind third- placed FC Dallas.
 Vancouver had lost two of their past three MLS games but made it four consecutive victories at BC Place Stadium thanks to goals from Uruguayan pair Octavio Rivero and Cristian Techera, bringing the Rapids' three-game winning streak to an end.
 After a goalless first half, Rivero - the Whitecaps' leading scorer this season - notched his 10th goal of the campaign with a header from Techera's 73rd-minute cross.
 Techera moved to six goals for the 2015 campaign - joining Kekuta Manneh in joint second in the club's scoring table - when he doubled the hosts' lead in the 77th minute, finishing with his second shot in the space of a few seconds after the Rapids failed to clear the ball from their defensive area.
 The Timbers' clash with Sporting also remained 0-0 at the interval, but Portland went close to breaking the deadlock soon after half-time with Fanendo Adi's header forcing visiting goalkeeper Tim Melia into a full-length save.
 Melia was in inspired form, while at the other end Graham Zusi hit the post for Sporting, but the Timbers were the dominant force - not that they could find a way past KC's gloveman.
 The 29-year-old finished with seven saves, including a low stop on Maxi Urruti's stoppage-time header.

“There’s going to be a huge craving for live music after this,” reckons Schulz. “The experience of collectively listening or dancing together – how that need is met will change in ways we can’t yet predict.” The reckoning with coronavirus’s impact seems to be moving from the bargaining stage to something approaching acceptance. Whether or not 2020 is a total write-off, music communities will need to meet these new challenges with creativity, says Schulz. “If ever there was a time to think outside the box, this is it.”

Separately, Dice, a ticketing partner, confirmed in emails that “emergency regulations have been introduced in Spain to help promoters through this crisis”, with the government suspending the need for festivals to process refunds until the state of alarm is over. This could be another month, or more. Primavera is perhaps unable to invoke a _force majeure_ clause – that coronavirus was unavoidable and thus insurers should pay out – owing to the complexities of Spanish insurance law. In previous relevant cases, a clause has been invoked that would allow insurers to modify contracts rather than see them cancelled. As taking the decision to cancel 2020’s edition is likely to inflict a heavy financial loss on Primavera, the festival is left to kick the can down the road and hope for the best. International ticketholders, who make up a substantial proportion of its audience, are low on empathy.

"The climate crisis has revealed the disastrous effects of single-minded growthmanship, and even within the UK, the rise in living standards has stalled over the last decade in the face of stagnant productivity and inflated housing costs. At the same time, the legacy of deindustrialisation and the rise of precarious work means that the need to support low-paid workers and their families is greater than ever. The question is not whether the UK’s post-industrial economic model requires an extensive system of cash benefits for working-age households, but what form it should take. The prevailing model of means-tested, conditional support backed up by benefit sanctions which has developed over the last 30 years – and is now reaching its apogee in Universal Credit – hardly fits with Keynes’ libertarian ethos. If the great man were alive today, he would no doubt be struck by the growing interest in UBI across the British left, including among Labour, Green, and Scottish National Party activists and some rank-and-file trade unionists. Indeed, John McDonnell has set out plans to run basic income pilots in Liverpool, Sheffield, and the Midlands if Labour wins the next election. Eighty years after Wansbrough suggested a basic income scheme to Keynes, it seems fitting that the political debate has come full circle. Whether this is the right moment to bring UBI ‘on to the tapis’ of British politics remains to be seen."

There is a real risk of reputational damage for those tripped up by overly optimistic reshuffles. Lyon’s Nuits Sonores festival organisers will have watched Emmanuel Macron’s speech on Monday night with distress – the premier extended France’s lockdown until 11 May, but added that public events would be the last to return as the country “progressively opened”, and that this could be later than July. The festival, which had already moved from May to July, is thus back in the red zone. A similar case befell Copenhagen’s Distortion, which was rescheduled from June to August but is now cancelled because Denmark has extended until September its ban on events involving more than 1,000 people.

One of the scenes most exciting of the Upcoming Deadline was the end of the Black Widow. Natasha Romanoff was an important part of the MCU since it was first introduced in Iron Man 2 in 2010, and has seen her go after a decade of being the heroine of the most recurrent character was heart-breaking, to say the least.

On Wednesday, the group dubbed the Evergreen Collaborative released a roadmap for the nation to emerge from the pandemic and hit the ground running pivoting the economy to clean energy. The 85-page plan shared with Earther borrows from Inslee as well as Elizabeth Warren’s expansive climate plans and has actions Congress and the president could take separately or in tandem. The timing comes as presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden looks to make inroads with young, climate-first voters who are a little, uh, unenthused about his climate plan and Congress considers another stimulus to help Americans cope with the coronavirus. They might want to take a look at what’s on offer.
