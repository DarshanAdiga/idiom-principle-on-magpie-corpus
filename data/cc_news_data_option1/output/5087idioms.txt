And I think, the good news is when you look at the recovery curve that's out on the website and the maturity curve. By and large, the good news is, they all have an upward trajectory. And we feel very confident that we're going to be able to get all of our states when we get past this thing back to a really good place. Some of them may get there quicker, but we're pretty darn confident. A good example of that is, when we opened California, we went up in there for more than three weeks but they opened and shut. Those stores opened up at a 30% index in their first week of operation. That's actually one of the highest opening week indexes we had in any state. So we're really optimistic that people want to get back to their everyday lives and actually we think that's going to happen everywhere eventually.

It is now more than five years since General Buratai took over as Nigeria’s army supremo. Buhari’s deadline for vanquishing Boko Haram ended five years ago. Five years is a long time. The Nigerian Civil War, despite its massive scale since it was fought between two sides with the tendencies to being independent nations, lasted for less than three years. Whereas, an insurgency in just one state, Borno State, and in parts of Yobe State, has lasted all of ten years without reprieve in sight for our belegaured nation. Gone is the chest beating act of ending the insurgency in no time. We are only regaled with tall tales of “decimation” of the insurgents and for more than three years we have heard the meaningless prattle of it being “technically degraded”. Yet, the reality confronting us is the nightmare of Boko Haram’s onslaught on the nation and Nigeria’s rating as the third most terrorised place in the world. The most recent Boko Haram bloody act is the murder of yet to be ascertained number of rice farmers in Borno State. Official statistics, which are usually doctored, put it at forty-three, but that number is in dispute as the natives insist that those who died are in excess of that figure. The casualties of the insurgency are not only civilians. Soldiers have died too, especially the rank and file. There are stories of soldiers mutinying and deserting the war fronts.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tommy “Tiny” Lister, a former wrestler who was known for his Deebo character in the “Friday” films, has died. He was 62.Lister’s manager, Cindy Cowan, said Lister was found unconscious in his home in Marina Del Rey, California, on Thursday afternoon. He was pronounced dead at the scene.Cowan said Lister was diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier this year. She said the actor overcame the virus, but he became sick about a week ago and recently had trouble breathing.The cause of death has not been released, and the coroner’s office is investigating.“He was a gentle giant,” Cowan said. “He had a smile as broad as you could imagine. He’s going to be missed by so many. We’re all devastated.”Lister started his career as a wrestler, standing 6-foot-5 with broad shoulders at about 275 pounds. His early roles included HBO football series “1st &amp; Ten” along with appearances in “Beverly Hills Cop II,” which starred Eddie Murphy, and “No Holds Barred,” the 1989 film where his character Zeus challenged Hulk Hogan in a wrestling match.However, Lister’s most notable role came in the 1995 film “Friday” and its sequel five years later. He portrayed the role of Deebo, a felon who was known as the neighborhood bully that terrorized his neighbors with intimidation and fear. His character was known for his infamous line “Get knocked out like your father used to.”Lister also appeared in “The Fifth Element,” “The Dark Knight” and “Austin Powers in Goldmember.”“RIP Tiny “Deebo” Lister,” Ice Cube said Thursday night on Instagram. “America’s favorite bully was a born entertainer who would pop into character at the drop of a hat terrifying people on and off camera. Followed by a big smile and laugh. Thank you for being a good dude at heart. I miss you already.”The death was first reported by celebrity website TMZ.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

When, in late 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari announced the emergence of the then Major General Tukur Yusuf Buratai as Nigeria’s Chief of Army Staff, many hailed it as a strategic appointment that will facilitate the former’s declared intention to exterminate the Boko Haram insurgency by December of that year. The tall two-star general was the Commander of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF), a coalition of troops from a number of countries battling insurgency in the sub region. Buratai is also from Borno State, the epicenter of the insurgency in the North-East and it was thought that his knowledge of the landscape will help him in routing the insurgents and that the natives would support his military campaign since the army was being led by one of their own. Buratai wasted no time in rolling out his battle plans including visits to the frontlines during which he encouraged the troops and participated in physical exercises. The Nigerian Army went a step further to establish a new division, the 7 Division with headquarters in Maiduguri, in its bid to take the battle to the ragtag terrorists and end it once and for all. Buratai added a pip to his epaulet and he became a Lieutenant General.

Q -- Jeffery Daniel Farmer -- Thank you very much. I'm just curious if you guys can provide some color on the impact that what looks like a pretty significant drop in special event a large part of bookings will have on your fiscal fourth quarter same-store sales. A - Brain: Well, as Scott said in his prepared remarks and I did too really, I was going to -- it's going to have a pretty significant impact. December special events represents about 15% of our overall sales in the month of December. And that business early on, we were actually booking some events. We geared up a small team to -- in some ways think happy thoughts that things would be a little bit better. We kind of lost that bet a bit. And so we're not expecting to have a particularly big special events calendar here over the course of the holidays. And so that's a pretty big headwind. And as you know, our overall party business for the full year is around 10% of overall sales. So, even the index is that we're talking about and we're disclosing pretty transparently here, those are -- we're generating those numbers in the face of special events business that's in the high single-digits in terms of mix with really no business. That headwind is going to get a little bit of figure here as we hit December. Okay. That's helpful. And then, you also -- I believe mentioned sort of the early entry into a third-party delivery. Anything you can share with us in terms of how impactful that's been, delivery sales mix in the stores that offer delivery?

With the spike in popularity of _Pokemon_ cards on Twitch, popular streamer Sodapoppin chose to take a different approach to his unboxing stream, opting to destroy the cards straight out of the box.
 Fortunately, fellow streamer Mizkif, who was brought in to witness the destruction, chose to save one of the rarest cards.
 After a Holographic Dark Charizard was pulled, Soda forced Mizkif to dunk it into water along with other Charizards that had been pulled during the stream. Understandably, Mizkif was hesitant to do this, although he was left with little choice.
 Following the dunking, Mizkif managed to take the card out, hiding it away so he could take it home.
 As you’d expect, Soda was not impressed to hear the news.
 The Holographic Dark Charizard has a value of $8,000, but now that it has water damage, that value has likely decreased significantly. Despite this, the card had a much nicer fate than many of the others who wound up being burned at the end of the stream.

A photograph of Meghan and Harry from their wedding took over a prime spot in Prince Charles's home
 Prince Charles shunned Kate Middleton and Prince William, and instead, gave Meghan Markle and Prince Harry a key position at his lavish royal abode.  
 The Prince of Wales, on Thursday, met with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi at Clarence House. While the meeting was a success, what the internet could not stop noticing was a portrait of Meghan and Harry placed in the background at Charles's home.
 The picture of the two princes also showed a framed photograph of Meghan and Harry from their wedding day taking over a prime spot on a table next to the fireplace.
 As reported by _Express UK,_ last month Charles posed with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in the same spot and a picture of Kate and William was placed back then.
 Now, as it seems, that picture has been replaced by Harry and Meghan's with a subtle nod of approval by the Prince of Wales.
 Harry and Meghan left the royal family earlier this year and recently reports of them being replaced by Princess Eugenie and Beatrice in Fab Four were circulating on the web.
